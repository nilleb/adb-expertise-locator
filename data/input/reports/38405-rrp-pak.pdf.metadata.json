The  Government  of  Pakistan  will \nprovide  an  assurance  that  any  subproject  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Environment \nPolicy.  \n \nThe  TA  loan  provides  a  key  intervention  of  the  long-term \npartnership  between  ADB  and  Pakistan  for  the  development  of \nKarachi.  It  responds  to  the  need  for  a  long-term  and  holistic \napproach to the development of Karachi whose large-scale needs \nfor  infrastructure  and  reforms  cannot  be  met  by  the  traditional \napproach  of  a  one-off  project.  The  TA  loan  supports  a  series  of \ncomplementary interventions whose cumulative effect will produce \nthe  synergy  to  speed  up  the  development  process  of  the  mega \ncity  on  a  sustainable  basis.  These \ninvolve \ncomprehensive capacity building of city district government, town \nmunicipal  administrations  (TMAs),  and  other  city  agencies  in  city \nplanning,  management,  and  adoption  and  implementation  of \ncommercial principles in providing infrastructure and services. The \nTA loan interventions also include support for preparing bankable \nprojects for the mega city infrastructure and services development \nin  an  efficient  and  integrated  manner.  Moreover,  the  TA  loan \ninvolves  interventions  for  sustainable  financing  of  the  mega  city \ninfrastructure through introducing an innovative financing vehicle.  \n \n\ninterventions \n\nThe  economy  and  population  of  Karachi  have  expanded \nsignificantly,  but  few  investments  have  been  made  in  the  city\u2019s \nurban  infrastructure  for  over  two  decades.  Infrastructure  and \nservices  that  are  inadequate  and  unreliable  are  adding  to \nbusiness  and  household  costs,  harming  Karachi\u2019s  urban  and \nnatural  environments,  and  decreasing \nthe  city\u2019s  global \ncompetitiveness  compared  with  alternative  Asian  mega  cities. \nThe  Government\u2019s  recent  devolution  policy  provides  major \nbenefits  to  be  realized,  but  it  has  left  many  issues  to  be \naddressed in such areas as (i) fiscal imbalance and unclear and \nlevels  of \nincomplete  allocation  of  responsibilities  between \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\ngovernment, and (ii) inadequacy of the city\u2019s and towns\u2019 financial \nand  technical  capacities  to  fully  meet  their  new  responsibilities \nwithin  the  devolved  framework.  There  is  a  need  for  substantial \nand  long-term  capacity  building  at  the  city  and  town  levels  if \ndevolution  is  to  yield  the  intended  benefits  for  more  effective \nurban  service  delivery.  There  is  also  increasing  recognition  that \nthe  growing  gap  between  urban  infrastructure  demand  and \ncurrent  supply  cannot  be  met  through  traditional  government \nsources,  including  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and \ntransfers  from  the  higher  levels  of  government.  Alternative \nsources of financing and new ways of providing infrastructure and \nservices are required.  \n\n \nThe expected impact of the TA loan is an enhanced and sustained \ncontribution of Karachi to national development and a sustainable \nimprovement  in  the  quality  of  life  for  the  city  residents,  including \nthe  poor.  The  expected  outcomes  are  (i) improved  city  planning, \nmanagement,  and  financing;  (ii) improved  and  expanded  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services;  and  (iii)  sustainable  and  efficient \nfinancing  of  urban  infrastructure.  To  these  ends,  the  TA  loan  will \nprovide resources for (i) building the capacities of the City District \nGovernment  of  Karachi  (CDGK),  TMAs,  and  utilities  in  city \nplanning,  management,  and  financing,  as  well  as  in  applying \ncommercial  principles  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and \nservices;  (ii)  assisting  to  prepare  bankable  projects  that  may \nsubsequently  be  funded  by  ADB  in  its  lending  assistance  to \nKarachi  over \nthe  next  4  years;  and  (iii)  establishing  and \noperationalizing  an  innovative  financing  vehicle  for  mega  city \ninfrastructure investments which will act as (a) an efficient conduit \nfor  channeling  ADB  and  other  funds  to  the  city,  (b)  a  catalyst  for \nreforming  the  city  agencies,  and  (c)  an  agent  to  mobilize  funds \nfrom  nongovernment  sources  for  large-scale  capital  investment \nneeds.  It  is  expected  that  the  TA  loan  will  also  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ownership  of  the  investment  projects,  capacity \nbuilding, and institutional reforms.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $13.330  million \nequivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  component  of  $6.460 \nmillion (48% of the total cost) and a local currency component of \n$6.870 million equivalent (52% of the total cost).  \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \nTotal \n \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n6.46 \n0.0 \n6.46 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n3.54 \n3.33 \n6.87 \n\nTotal \nCost \n10.00 \n 3.33 \n13.33  \n\n% \n\n 75 \n 25 \n100 \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $10.0 million equivalent in special drawing rights (SDR) \nand  various  currencies  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  will \nbe provided.

It  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  Project \nDirector  and  staffed  with  suitably  qualified  personnel.  The  PSU \nfor \nwill  oversee \nimplementing part C (specialized financing vehicle). \n \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  Government \nof  Sindh\u2019s  Minister,  Finance,  will  be  formed.  It  will  include  the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  Development,  the  Minister  of  Local \nGovernment,  Nazim  (city  mayor),  CDGK,  Additional  Chief \nSecretary  (Development),  Planning  and  Development,  Sindh, \nSecretary  Finance,  Secretary  Local  Government,  Sindh,  District \nCoordination Officer of CDGK, and the Project Director, PSU and \ntwo  representatives  from  NGOs/academia.  Project  Director  PSU \nwill  act  also  as  the  secretary  of  the  PSC.  The  PSC  will  provide \npolicy  support,  oversee  project  progress,  facilitate  cooperation \namong agencies concerned, and ensure the timely undertaking of \nreform  actions  to  establish  and  operationalize  the  specialized \nfinancing  vehicle  and  to  implement  organizational  development, \nrevenue  mobilization  and \nfinancial  management,  and  other \nreforms  at  CDGK  and  the  TMAs.  The  committee  will  meet \nquarterly or upon request by any of its members.  \n \nCDGK  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  part  A  (Capacity \nBuilding  Facility)  and  part  B  (Project  Preparation  Facility).  A \nproject working group (PWG), chaired by the district coordination \nofficer,  will  be  formed  to  provide  oversight  for  all  operational \nmatters and coordinate with part C. The PWG will meet bimonthly \nand  have  specific  responsibility  for  approving  the  prioritization  of \nsubprojects,  final  terms  of  reference  (TORs),  and  consultant \nselection  for  subprojects  under  parts  A  and  B  prior  to  their \nsubmission to the PSU for onward transmittal to ADB. \n  \nA  local  support  unit  (LSU)  will  be  established  in  CDGK  (the \nimplement \nDepartment  of  Finance  and  Planning) \norganizational  development,  and  coordinate  those  activities  and \nindividual  programs  of  parts  A  and  B  which  will  mainly  be \nimplemented by the individual subproject units in respective sector \ndepartments of CDGK.  \n \nAll  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n\nto  plan, \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nInternational  and/or  domestic  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited \nusing  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based  selection  and  quality-based \nselection  procedures  as  appropriate  for  each  subproject.  Certain \nsubprojects  will  utilize  quality-based  selection,  as  these  require \nexpertise  of  limited  availability.  Consulting  firms  and  individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \nSpecialists in urban planning, water supply, sewerage, solid waste \nmanagement,  urban  transport  and  roads,  low  income  community \nupgrading,  private  sector  participation  in  urban  infrastructure \nprovision,  economics,  finance,  social  development,  resettlement, \nand  the  environment  will  help  CDGK  carry  out  comprehensive \nfeasibility  analyses  and,  where  necessary,  engineering  designs, \npreparation  of  bid  documents,  and  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Specialists  in  urban \ngovernance,  urban/municipal  finance,  institutional  development, \nand corporate governance will also be recruited to help design and \nimplement programs under the capacity building facility. \n \nTentative estimates of the consulting services requirements for the \nwhole  TA \nloan  are  about  145  and  430  person-months  of \ninternational and domestic consultants, respectively. \n \nThe  mega  city\u2019s  population  will  realize  sustainable  benefits  from \nimproved  governance  and  CDGK\u2019s  enhanced  capacities  for \neffective  city  planning,  management,  and  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  services.  This  will  be  achieved  through  (i) \norganizational  development  of  CDGK  within \nthe  devolved \nstructure; (ii) managerial and technical capacity improvements; (iii) \nimproved  financial  planning,  budgeting,  and  reporting,  as  well  as \n(iv)  customer  orientation  and \nenhanced \ncommercialization  reforms  within  CDGK,  utilities,  and  TMAs;  and \n(v) enhanced public, private, and community partnership in urban \nservice provision.  \n \nThe  TA  loan  through  the  project  preparation  facility  will  support \nKarachi\u2019s economic development and poverty reduction by means \nof  efficient  and  timely  provision  of  funds  and  assistance  for \npreparing  bankable  subprojects.  The  subprojects  will  address \nhigh-priority \nthe  needs  of  poor \nsettlements  that  make  up  a  substantial  portion  of  the  city.  The \nimmediate beneficiary will be the CDGK, whose gains will include \nimproved  governance  and  transparency  in  consultant  selection \nand procurement and enhanced project preparation capacities.  \n \nThe TA loan will ensure sustainable development of the mega city \nby  helping  to  establish  and  operationalize  a  viable,  specialized \nmega city financing vehicle which will (i) act as an efficient conduit \nto  channel  funds  to  mega  city  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  be \nan \naccelerating \ncommercialization of urban infrastructure and services, and (iii) in \n\ninfrastructure  needs  and \n\nrevenues; \n\nimportant \n\npromoter \n\ncatalyst \n\nlocal \n\nand \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nterm,  mobilize \n\nthe  medium-to-long \nfrom  alternative \nnongovernment  sources.  The  ultimate  beneficiaries  will  be  the \nresidents  and  businesses  of  not  only  the  Karachi  city  but  the \ncountry  as  a  whole,  since  Karachi\u2019s  contribution  to  the  economy \ngoes beyond the city and province. \n \n\nfunds \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major potential risks include those related to (i) possible delays in \nproject  implementation  due  to  inadequate  capacities  of  CDGK, \n(ii) possible delays in government reform actions to implement the \nproposed  improvements  under  the  capacity  building  component,  \nand  (iii)  a  possible  lack  of  cooperation  from  civil  society  and \nnongovernment organizations.  \n \nTo  mitigate  the  possible  delays  in  project  implementation,  the \nProject provides support for TA loan management whereby a core \nteam of experts/advisors is to be engaged at the Project\u2019s outset \nto  assist  the  PSU,  PWG,  and  LSU  in  reviewing  and  revising  the \nscope of components, prioritizing subprojects, finalizing the TORs, \nrecruiting consultants and evaluating the consultant outputs.   \n \nThe  risk  of  delay  in  government  actions  to  implement  the \nproposed  reforms  for  organizational  development,  tariffs,  local \nrevenues,  financial  management,  corporatization,  and  customer \norientation  will  be  mitigated  by  close  ADB  supervision  of \nimplementation.  ADB  will  be  actively  engaged  throughout  the \nprogress  of  the  capacity  building  subprograms,  and  especially  in \nthose  having  policy  and  sector  reform \nimplications.  Each \nsubprogram will identify the time-bound actions to be taken by the \nGovernment  at  the  early  stages  of  its  implementation  and  which \nwill form the content of the policy dialogue with CDGK, GOS and \nADB.  In  addition,  the  PSC  will  use  its  considerable  political  and \nadministrative  clout  to  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  reform \nactions.  \n \nFinally, the additional risk that may emerge due to possible lack of \ncooperation from civil society will be addressed through involving \nthe  representatives  of  the  nongovernment  organizations  in  the \nPSC,  and  ensuring  the  participation  of  the  civil  society,  business \ncommunity,  and  the  urban  poor  in  developing  and  implementing \nthe subprojects.  \n \n\n \n \n\n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n1. \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Mega City Development \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES   \n\nIntroduction  \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nIn its midterm development framework, the Government of Pakistan (Government) made \n2. \na  commitment  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  and  quality  of  life  in  its  large  cities.  The \nGovernment constituted a high-level committee led by the Planning Commission for coordinated \ndevelopment of its mega cities, starting with Karachi as a central plank in its long-term economic \ndevelopment  strategy.  In  this  context,  the  Government  requested  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB) assistance to address the mega city challenges facing Pakistan. Given the immense size \nof Karachi, the magnitude of its investment requirements, and the scale of interventions for urban \npolicy  reforms,  both  ADB  and  the  Government  recognized  that  the  needs  of  Karachi  cannot  be \naddressed  by  a  one-off  approach,  but,  rather  require  a  series  of  appropriately  sequenced \ninterventions.  Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU)  for  2005\u20132006 \nincluded  a  TA  loan1  in  2005,  as  the  first  intervention  of  the  long-term  mega  city  assistance \nprogram to enable the Government to undertake preparation of priority projects, critically needed \nurban institutional and financial reforms, and comprehensive capacity building.  \n \nB. \n \nEconomy. Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, is the commercial hub and gateway of \n3. \nPakistan.  It  accounts  for  95%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  trade  and  contributes  30%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial production. Nearly 90% of the country\u2019s head offices of banks, financial institutions and \nmultinational companies are located in Karachi. The country\u2019s largest stock exchange is Karachi-\nbased.  The  city  contributes  20%  of  the  national  gross  domestic  product,  accounts  for  40%  of \nnational  employment  in  large-scale  manufacturing,  and  contributes  25%  of  national  and  40%  of \nprovincial revenues.  \n \nDemography.  According  to  the  1998  census,  Karachi  had  a  population  of  9.2  million  in \n4. \n1998, which compares with 5.2 million in 1981. Based upon the intercensal (1981\u20131998) annual \ngrowth  rate  of  4.5%,  the  current  population  of  Karachi  is  estimated  at  12.5  million  and  the \npopulation is projected to reach 20.7 million in 2015. The city is made up of 18 contiguous towns.  \n \n5. \nMega  City  Development  Trends.  The  geographical  location  and  economic  potential  of \nKarachi  have  drawn  both  labor  and  capital  for  many  decades,  but  the  city  has  never  been  in  a \nposition to maximize this potential to benefit the city. Little investment into the city\u2019s infrastructure \nhas  been  made  over  the  past  two  decades.  Neither  new  investments  nor  new  additions  to  the \nlabor force have been optimally located in the city, resulting in haphazard development, a polluted \nurban environment, and, for many households, a poor quality of life.  \n \nPoverty. Based on the 2001 poverty line2 and the fiscal year 2001\u20132002 income levels3 \n6. \nfor  Karachi,  50%  of  the  city\u2019s  total  population  is  poor.  The  pattern  of  household  income  shows \n\n                                                 \n1  TA  PAK-4578  (ADB.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Mega  City  Development \nProject. Manila. ) supported preparation of the TA loan. It was approved in April 2005 in the amount of $150,000.  \n2  The  poverty  line  adopted  by  the  Government  is  based  on  a  caloric  norm  of  2,350  calories  per  adult  per  day  and \nminimum  nonfood  requirements.  This  poverty  line  approximates  PRs748.6  per  month  per  adult  in  FY  2001 \n(Government of Pakistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.)  \n\n3  The income level calculations are based on (i) figures for monthly income range and percentage of households in the \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey, 2001\u20132002 and (ii) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (see footnote 2).  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthat around 9.5% of the households are living in extreme and chronic poverty while another 14% \nare transitory poor. The incidence of poverty varies in the 18 towns and the cantonment areas in \nthe  city.  The  highest  incidence  is  in  katchi  abadis,  which  are  informally  developed  and  poor \nsettlements.  It  is  estimated  that  89%  of  the  population  of  katchi  abadis  lives  below  the  poverty \nline.  \n \n\nUrban Environment. Karachi both faces and causes significant environmental issues and \n7. \npressures.  Outside  the  mega  city,  the  major  environmental  resources  adversely  affected  by \nactivities in the city are the coastline and the near-shore marine habitat. More than 900,000 cubic \nmeters (some 200 million gallons) per day of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater and \nover 1,000 tons per day of uncollected solid waste finds its way directly or indirectly to the sea, \nproviding  a  constant  source  of  marine  pollution.  Karachi\u2019s  industries  generate  a  cocktail  of \nchemicals and toxic substances, and a significant amount of industrial effluent is discharged into \ncreeks,  rivers,  or  the  sea.  New  development  takes  place  within  environmentally  sensitive  areas \nand reserves for critical infrastructure, causing major environmental problems. Vehicle-generated \nair pollution is severe, with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the air causing \nrespiratory problems among a large number of mega city residents.  \n \nC. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nInadequate Mega City Management: Need for Capacity Building  \n\n1. \n \nMega  City  Governance  in  Transition.  The  weak  city  governance  and  management \n8. \nsystems lead to poor performance in planning and provision of infrastructure and services in the \nmega city. The devolution reforms of 2001 have ushered in a need for major restructuring of the \nlocal  government  through  transfer  of  political  and  administrative  power  to  the  elected  local \nauthorities.  The  City  District  Government  of  Karachi  (CDGK)  became  the  central  player  in \nmanaging  the  city\u2019s  affairs  while  the  town  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  of  18  towns  were \ntasked with core municipal functions, including town planning and provision of infrastructure and \nservices  for  water,  sanitation,  roads,  streetlights,  etc.  Although  the  devolution  has  provided  a \ngood  opportunity  for  effective  service  provision,  it  has  led  to  continuing  overlaps  and \nfragmentation. Various agencies at provincial level remain responsible for service provision that is \nnow the responsibility of CDGK and TMAs. The post-devolution institutional structure of CDGK is \nprimarily an outcome of joining past provincial offices and their employees into CDGK, rather than \nany  major  reorganization  needed  to  undertake  the  management  of  a  mega  city  along  modern \nlines (see the organization of CDGK in Appendix 2).  \n \n9. \nIn the devolution process, the capacity of some technically well-endowed agencies, such \nas  the  Karachi  Development  Authority,  was  lost  without  providing  an  alternative  devolved \nstructure  for  them.  The  restructuring  of  such  major  service  providers  as  Karachi  Water  and \nSewerage  Board  (KWSB)  and  coordination  with  the  TMAs  remain  to  be  addressed.  Personnel \nadministration within the devolved setup continues to be an issue. While the provincial staff were \nphysically  transferred  to  CDGK,  they  remain  administratively  under  the  Government  of  Sindh \n(GOS),  limiting  the  power  of  CDGK  on  personnel  matters  and  undermining  employee  and \nmanagement  accountability.  The  organization  is  overstaffed,  with  a  concentration  of  low-grade \nemployees.  A  large  majority  of  the  staff  does  not  have  the  qualifications  and  skills  required  to \ndischarge the new responsibilities and facilitate evolution of an accountable work ethic in CDGK.  \n \n10. \nThere  is  a  need  to  introduce  appropriate  institutional  structures,  business  practices,  and \nimproved  capacities  if  the  devolution  is  to  yield  the  intended  benefits  with  regard  to  improved \ngovernance  and  effective  service  delivery.  This  would  require  (i)  evolution  of  new  regulatory \nrelationships between GOS, CDGK, and the TMAs, with GOS and CDGK assuming greater roles \nfor regulation and oversight; (ii) clarity of functional responsibilities between GOS and CDGK, as \nwell  as  within  CDGK;  (iii)  organizational  development  of  CDGK  and  the  TMAs;  (iv)  introducing \ncustomer  orientation  and  commercialization  in  CDGK  and  utilites;  and  (v)  human  resource \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nmanagement that combines rationalization strategies, training, and personnel management for a \nproductive workforce in CDGK and TMAs. These improvements form the priority subprograms of \ncapacity building assistance in the Project.  \n\n  \n11. \nLack  of  Planned  Approach  to  Development.  Inadequate  planning  systems  resulted  in \nhaphazard growth of the mega city. The current planning system has not articulated into plans the \nstrategic  directions  and  visions  for  the  city\u2019s  economic  development.  The  planning  system  is \nneither  linked  to  prioritized  action  plans  nor  to  financial  strategies  needed  to  realize  them.  The \nrecent  master  plan,  prepared  for  the  period  up  to  2000,  was  not  adopted  due  to  lack  of \ninstitutional clarity for approving and implementing plans. Master planning has been constrained \nby (i) a lack of strategic guidance, (ii) institutional uncertainty, (iii) land management issues of the \nmega  city,  and  (iv)  ineffective  building  control  and  enforcement.  The  situation  has  been \naggravated  by  the  fact  that  nearly  90%  of  city  land  is  under  the  ownership  of  various  public \ninstitutions, each of which has authority over land use and planning with regard to its own land.  \n \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  has  recently  supported  a  study4  for  the \n12. \n\u201crevitalization of Karachi.\u201d A vision for Karachi was established as a \u201ccosmopolitan gateway city\u201d \nof international business and tourism. This vision would be achieved through (i) social upgrading, \ninvolving  tourism  and  business  infrastructure  and  amenities,  welfare  services,  skills  upgrading, \nand  citizen  mobilization;  and  (ii)  urban  and  industrial  development  through  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  possible  renovation  of  Karachi\u2019s  circular  railway,  and  improving  the  urban \nenvironment.  There  remains  a  need,  however,  to  translate  this  vision  into  concrete  plans  and \nprograms. CDGK recently embarked on preparing an updated mega city master plan. Building on \nthe  work  done  by  JBIC,  the  proposed  TA  loan  will  support  CDGK  in  its  endeavor  for  mega  city \nplanning.  The  planning  assistance  is  also  aimed  to  be  instrumental  in  developing  and \ninstitutionalizing a planning system that (i) integrates economic, social, environmental and spatial \nplanning;  (ii)  is  linked  to  financing  strategies  for  implementing  the  plans;  (iii)  is  based  on  clear \ninstitutional  roles  to  approve  and  implement  the  plans;  and  (iv)  is  supplemented  by  effective \ndevelopment and building control systems.  \n \nLimited Revenue Base. The available funds of CDGK and the TMAs are not sufficient to \n13. \noffer the level of infrastructure services needed to support a reasonable quality of life in Karachi. \nUnder  the  devolution,  expenditure  obligations  of  CDGK  and  the  TMAs  have  been  substantially \nextended.  It  is  commonly  perceived,  however,  that  devolution  assigned  weak  fiscal  revenue \nbases. There remain deficiencies in the transfer system among levels of government, such as a \nlack  of  incentives  for  increasing  local  revenue  performance  at  the  city  level.  The  existing  local \nrevenue  base\u2014which  primarily  consists  of  local  taxation  in  the  forms  of  property  taxes,  land \nrevenue, and entertainment tax, as well as service charges especially for water, sewerage, and \nsolid  waste  collection\u2014is  further  reduced  by  weak  capacities  to  levy  and  collect  taxes  and \ncharges  and  inadequate  tariff  structures  and  rates.  It  is  estimated  that  CDGK\u2019s  own-source \nrevenues constitute only 49% of total revenues while those of the TMAs range from 36% to 56%.  \n   \nThere is a need to expand the resources available to CDGK and the TMAs by improving \n14. \nthe fiscal transfer system and local own-source revenues. The current efforts of GOS to develop \na sound fiscal transfer system need to be supported in coordination with other relevant initiatives \n(e.g.,  ADB\u2019s  decentralization  support  program).  With  regard  to  own-source  revenues,  there  is \nconsiderable  scope  to  improve  the  yield  of  property  tax  by  (i)  computerization  of  records;  (ii) \nshifting the base from annual rental value to transaction value; and (iii) removing tax exemptions \nby  inclusion  of  military,  federal  and  provincial  properties,  as  well  as  household  and  commercial \nproperties that are currently excluded from the tax net. It is estimated that by including exempted \nand  unrecorded  properties,  revenues  could  be  expanded  by  at  least  50%.  User  charges\u2014\nespecially  for  water,  sewerage,  and  solid  waste\u2014present  another  area  for  greater  scope  in \nincreasing  local  revenues.  Current  tariffs  are  low  and  remain  unchanged  since  1998,  even  as \n                                                 \n4 JBIC. 2004. Karachi Vitalization Scenario.  Pakistan. \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nutility  expenses  have  increased  by  40%  over  the  same  period.  The  majority  of  users  are  not \nmetered.  User  fees  are  charged  on  the  basis  of  plot  or  flat  sizes  and  are  not  based  on \nconsumption.  Currently,  KWSB  cannot  meet  its  operating  costs  without  subsidy.  There  is  an \nurgent need to devise and implement tariff structures and rates that provide adequate revenues \nto  cover  cash  operating  costs,  proper  operations  and  maintenance,  debt  service,  depreciation \nand a share of future capital expenditure.      \n \n15. \nCDGK\u2019s  current  financial  management  systems  are  complex  and  fragmented.  An \nintegrated  accounting  and  reporting  system  is  needed.  The  two  fund  streams  (local  and \nprovincial) that continue, despite the legal amendments, need to be merged. A strong system of \nfinancial  accounting  and  reporting  should  be  evolved  by  strengthening  CDGK\u2019s  Department  of \nFinance  and  Planning  and  making  it  mandatory  to  furnish  regular  accounting  and  financial \ninformation. Accounts offices need also to be set up in towns to integrate TMA accounting within \nthe  entire  system.  All  these  efforts  need  to  be  supported  by  management  information  systems. \nDeveloping  and  implementing  a  revenue  enhancement  plan  (including  tariff  studies)  and \nimproved  financial  management  forms  a  major  component  of  the  capacity  building  assistance \nunder the TA loan.  \n \n16. \nInadequate financial management and revenues also limit the Karachi city government in \neffectively  utilizing  options  for  such  financing  alternatives  as  to  outsource  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  management  to  the  private  sector.  Private  sector  participation  is  further \nhindered  by  (i)  lack  of  clear  policies  and  laws  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  government \nlevels  to  promote  public-private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  (ii)  lack  of  institutional  capacity  in \nCDGK  to  develop,  analyze,  and  prepare  bankable  projects  as  well  as  to  structure,  tender, \nevaluate,  contract  out,  negotiate,  and  regulate  PPP  transactions.  The  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Development Project (PPID) currently being processed by ADB intends to address \nthe  above  issues  by  creating  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  framework  at  the  national  level \nthat will facilitate and complement the local reforms under the Project. \n \nUntapped  Sources  of  the  Citizen  Community  Boards.  Under  the  devolution,  citizen \n17. \ncommunity  boards  (CCBs)  were  organized  to  enhance  community  participation,  cost  sharing, \noperation  and  maintenance  of  development  projects,  and  accountability.  Devolution  stipulated \nthat  25%  of  the  annual  development  funds  of  every  town  are  to  be  spent  through  CCBs.  While \nCCBs have been active elsewhere in the country, they have remained inactive in Karachi. As a \nresult,  millions  of  rupees  earmarked  for  CCBs  have  accumulated  and  provide  readily  available \nfunds for development. Mobilizing CCBs in Karachi would achieve public-community partnership \nfor  development  projects  and  a  greater  accountability  over  the  use  of  development  funds. \nActivation of CCBs will therefore be an important element of capacity building activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInadequate Infrastructure and Services and Need for Upgrading/Expansion  \n\n \nA major outcome of the weak governance and management of the mega city has been the \n18. \ninadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  including  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage,  solid \nwaste management, urban transport and roads, and basic services for the city\u2019s poor.  \n \n19.  Water. While an estimated 82% of households have a water supply connection, water is \navailable in the network only for a few hours every second day. With the exception of one or two \ntowns, many households rely on tankers to supply potable water. System losses (technical and \nadministrative)  are  high  and  occur  through  leakages,  illegal  connections,  and  the  lack  of \nmetering. Water quality is poor, and over 75% of water samples taken from the system are below \nWorld Health Organization standards. This is due to (i) the lack of adequate treatment and poor \nfunctioning  of  treatment  plants,  and  (ii)  intermittent  flow  and  variable  pressures  in  the  system. \nProblems are aggravated by a lack of long-term system planning for water supply and sewerage \nand insufficient cost-recovery measures that result in poor operation and maintenance.  \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n20. \nSewerage and Drainage. Although an estimated 89% of households have a flush toilet, \nconnected to either a sewer or septic tank, the sewerage network suffers from poor connectivity \nand a large number of undersized and broken sections. The sewerage treatment plants function \nat below their capacity due to inadequate maintenance and frequent blockages caused by solid \nwaste  entering  the  plants.  Much  of  the  untreated  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  is \ndischarged into the stormwater drainage system and rivers and thence to Karachi Harbor and the \nArabian Sea. A large part of the stormwater drainage functions as part of the wastewater disposal \nsystem. Most of the drainage lines are heavily encroached and used for disposing of solid waste. \nThere is need (i) in the short term for programs to establish drainage rights of way and systems of \nroutine maintenance, (ii) in the medium term for a drainage master plan, and (iii) for progressively \nachieving separation between wastewater and stormwater systems.      \n \n21. \nSolid Waste Management. An estimated 7,250 tons of solid waste is generated daily in \nthe city. Only about 60% of this is collected, and no more than 25% of that amount makes it to \none  of  the  two  designated  city  \u201clandfill\u201d  sites\u2014actually  open  dumping  sites.  The  remainder  is \neither recovered for recycling or is disposed of by burning or by illegal dumping into open spaces. \nThe piles of uncollected waste are a nuisance and attract vermin that can carry disease. Informal \nsolid  waste  recycling  is  significant.  The  poor  performance  in  solid  waste  management  is \nexacerbated by (i) lack of a practical waste management plan involving all stakeholders (e.g., the \nformal and informal private sectors), (ii) lack of mechanisms and sound feasibility studies required \nfor outsourcing to the private sector, and (iii) inadequate capacities for tracking and monitoring of \nthe solid waste systems. \n \n22. \nUrban Transport. The city population relies almost entirely on the road network for urban \ntransportation. There is currently no mass transit system per se, although many commute using \nthe  network  of  bus  routes.  Rapid  growth  rate  of  private  vehicles  (9%  per  annum)  leads  to \novercrowding,  air  pollution,  and  accidents.  While  there  has  been  a  significant  program  of  road \nbuilding, no major investment in public transport systems has taken place. Attempts to revive the \nKarachi circular railway and a light rail mass transit system have failed to attract public or private \ninvestment.  The  quality  of  major  thoroughfares  is  generally  good,  but  the  distributor  network \nvaries dramatically. The current focus on primary networks in the absence of a distributor network \nis resulting in reduced benefits from investments in primary networks. The sector operations have \nbeen adversely affected by (i) lack of clarity on institutional roles and overlapping responsibilities \nbetween  several  departments  of  CDGK5  and  (ii)  lack  of  a  transport  master  plan  to  guide  future \ndevelopment of roads and public transport and a strategy for financing the city\u2019s transport system. \nA detailed infrastructure assessment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nOne  common  issue  across  all  infrastructure  subsectors  is  the  poor  standard  of  project \n23. \nidentification and preparation, which subsequently leads to poor performance in infrastructure and \nservices.  This  issue  further  reinforces  (i)  disjointed  and  inefficient  infrastructure  and  service \nprovision,  (ii)  failure  of  projects  to  achieve  their  anticipated  benefits,  (iii)  poor  project \nsustainability, and (iv) inability to access commercial financing for public infrastructure provision. \nThe proposed TA loan will assist CDGK in selecting and developing bankable projects to address \nthe mega city\u2019s high-priority infrastructure and service needs. \n \nKatchi  Abadis.  Katchi  abadis,  in  which  40%  of  the  city  population  lives,  are  created  by \n24. \ninformal settlers. They are located on public or privately-owned land without legal property rights. \nThese  settlements  have  grossly  limited  access  to  public  water  supply,  sewage,  and  other \nservices. They invest a significant part of their incomes to purchase potable water and construct \nin-house septic tanks to dispose of wastewater. About 70% of households are connected to the \npublic  sector\u2019s  piped  water  supply  system.  The  remaining  population  depends  on  unprotected \n\n                                                 \n5  Recently the two units were consolidated under the same director general, but the full integration will likely take time. \n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nNeed for an Innovative Financing Mechanism \n\nsources  and,  on  average,  spends  5\u20138%  of  its  monthly  income  to  purchase  water,  which  is  an \nadditional factor contributing to poverty.  \n \n25. \nThe estimated number of these settlements is over 1,000, of which 539 have already been \nlisted  for  regularization  and  upgrading  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy.  Expansion  of  these \nsettlements continues at a rate of some 10% per year, and this requires urgent attention. A two-\npronged  approach  is  required  that  involves  (i)  upgrading,  where  possible,  of  existing  squatter \nsettlements  with  minimum  displacement  and  (ii)  developing  a  shared  strategy  for  those  katchi \nabadis  that  cannot  benefit  from  on-site  upgrading.  Coalitions  of  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), community groups, and CCBs must be formed if this approach is to be successful.       \n \n \n \nThe mega city infrastructure backlogs are too huge6 to be financed through the traditional \n26. \npublic sector sources, even if their potential were fully exploited. The funding gap in meeting the \ncity\u2019s infrastructure requirements will need to be met through alternative financing in the form of \nlong-tenor  debt.  However,  currently  neither  CDGK  nor  the  TMAs  have  the  capacity  to  access \ncommercial financing and to raise private finance through the capital markets for long-term funds \neven  if  they  were  empowered  to  do  so.  More  viable  institutions,  performing  financial \nintermediation  functions  that  would  specialize  on  Karachi\u2019s  urban  infrastructure  sector  and  that \ncan pool risks and manage investor concerns, would be needed to enable CDGK and the TMAs \nto access nongovernment sources of financing.  \n \n27.  Moreover, it is commonly perceived that the Government has not been efficient in the role \nof  funds  provider  to  the  sector,  as  its  allocation  of  funds  has  not  been  driven  by  commercial \nrationale.  In  this  environment,  the  federal,  provincial,  and  city  governments  all  strongly  support \nintroducing a specialized financing vehicle (SFV) for the mega city that would (i) act in the short \nterm  as  an  efficient  conduit  to  channel  funds  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to \nKarachi infrastructure projects; (ii) provide technical assistance in preparing infrastructure projects \nto  bankable  standards,  and  monitor  funded  projects  to  ensure  loan  repayment;  and  (iii)  in  the \nmedium-to-long term catalyze funds from nongovernment sources for sustainable financing of city \ninfrastructure and services. The SFV is envisaged to provide commercial and concessional funds \n(depending  on  the  ultimate  design  and  mandate  of  the  vehicle)  both  directly  to  infrastructure \nprojects and indirectly to other fund providers (such as in the form of guarantees to private sector \nplayers investing in infrastructure and services).  \n \n28. \nA  comparison  of  two  scenarios\u2014with  and  without  a  financing  vehicle\u2014for  the  mega  city \nshows  that  introducing  a  mega  city  financing  vehicle  will  facilitate  allocation  of  financial  capital \ninvestments to worthy projects and borrowers.  The vehicle will provide an incentive mechanism \nfor enhancing the tariff structures, financial discipline, and creditworthiness by enforcing improved \nbudgeting,  auditing,  and  disclosure  standards  at  CDGK,  TMAs  and  the  utilities.  It  will  provide  a \nmechanism through which CDGK, the TMAs and utilities can gain credit experience and history \nso  that  they  can  gradually  gain  access  to  commercially  based  credits.  Through  tying  funds \nallocation  to  commercial  principles,  the  SFV  will  act  as  an  important  catalyst  and  promoter  of \naccelerated capacity building, sound project preparation, financial reforms, commercialization of \nfor  providing  and  managing \ninfrastructure  providers,  and,  over \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  Karachi  and  possibly  in  Sindh.  Introduction  of  a  specialized \nfinancing vehicle for the mega city will therefore constitute a major component of the TA loan.  \n \n\ntime,  private \n\nfinancing \n\n                                                 \n6  The estimated overall cost of priority subprojects in Appendix 5 (excluding mass transit) is about $350 million. The \noverall cost of short-term projects in CDGK\u2019s midterm development plan is estimated at above $1.165 billion. Based \non  a  methodology  that  relates  growth  in  per  capita  income  to  the  need  for  expanded  urban  infrastructure,  it  is \nestimated  that  $0.5  billion  to  $1.0  billion  per  year  is  required  to  maintain  an  adequate  stock  of  infrastructure  in \nKarachi. The actual requirement may be higher due to the poor state of existing infrastructure stock. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthe \n\nlocal \n\n29. \nDue to strong demand from the three levels of government for an SFV for the mega city, \nthe  feasibility  and  design  of  the  SFV  will  be  undertaken  by  parallel  TA7  to  be  provided  by  ADB \nahead of commencing the TA loan implementation. Upon completion of the feasibility study and \ndesign of the SFV, the TA loan, then, will assist in establishing and operationalizing the vehicle.  \n \n30. \nEstablishing  a  mega  city  financing  vehicle,  however,  will  not  automatically  and  by  itself \nresult  in  making  extensive  sources  of  alternative  funds  available  for  Karachi\u2019s  infrastructure.  It \nmust be accompanied by other reforms, including (i) a supportive framework for appropriate tariff \nschedules;  (ii)  a  better  fiscal  balance  between  different  levels  of  government;  (iii)  resource \nmobilization  at \nlevel;  (iv)  CDGK  operating  on  a  more  efficient  basis;  (v) \ncommercialization  of  water,  sanitation,  and  other  service  providers;  (vi)  management  systems, \nincluding  accounting  practices,  that  allow  disclosure  of  amounts  due  to  and  from  others,  (vii) \nchanges in attitudes of residents about paying tariffs; and (viii) well designed, bankable projects \nwith tariff structures to recover costs of capital, operation and maintenance, and with enhanced \nproject management capacities to create assets quickly so that incomes from investments begin \nto accrue without delay. All these reforms are important elements of the comprehensive capacity \nbuilding program under the TA loan. The reforms for establishing the SFV for the mega city and \nthe  reforms  for  capacity  building  at  city  level  will  be  complementary  to  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  PPID \ninitiative at the national level.  \n \n31.  While  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  sector  has  been  significantly  reformed  over  the  past  decade, \nwith  ADB  and  other  external  assistance,  there  has  been  virtually  no  commercial  lending  and \nprivate financing of urban infrastructure projects in Karachi and other cities. Thus, the SFV would \nnot  compete  with  existing  financial  institutions  in  the  country.  Rather,  the  SFV,  working  closely \nwith ADB, governments, and existing financial intermediaries, would help to develop a market for \ncommercial  lending  and  private  financing  of  urban  infrastructure  that  could  subsequently  be \naccessed by the existing financial intermediaries.  \n \n \n \nSince 1976, ADB has provided eight loans to the urban sector, totaling about $450 million, \n32. \nand a further $6.75 million for TA in the water supply, sanitation, and urban development sectors. \nTwo loans8 were provided to Karachi in the urban sector 20 and 15 years ago, respectively. The \ncity  has  also  been  the beneficiary of  two  ADB  programs:  the  Decentralization  Support  Program \nand  the  Sindh  Devolved  Social  Services.  Moreover,  ADB  is  currently  funding  TA  in  Sindh  on \nenvironmental management that should also benefit Karachi.  \n \n33. \nThe World Bank provided assistance to Karachi in the past in the water supply and power \nsectors.  Its  current  assistance  is  through  GOS,  with  which  it  has  a  line  of  structural  adjustment \ncredit. Another initiative under the World Bank\u2019s umbrella is support of the Water and Sanitation \nProgram to KWSB on institutional strengthening. In recent years, the principal bilateral source of \ninvestment in the urban sector in Karachi has been the Government of Japan, particularly in the \nwater  supply,  sewerage,  and  transport  sectors.  KWSB  is  completing  a  water  treatment  project \nsupported by JBIC, which also assisted in preparing the \u201cRevitalization Scenario\u201d for Karachi. The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has begun preparing a master plan for Karachi\u2019s \nwater supply and sewerage, and it has plans to support preparation of a transport master plan for \nthe city. The list of external assistance is attached as Appendix 3. \n \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned from ADB assistance  \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2005.

Manila for $34 million.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n34. \nLessons  learned  from  the  two  ADB  loan  projects  to  Karachi  (footnote  8),  which  were \nevaluated as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and \u201cpartially successful,\u201d include the need for (i) greater attention to \nsustainability,  (ii)  enhanced  project  design  based  on  sound  assessments,  (iii)  careful \nconsideration  for  institutional  shortcomings  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  (iv) \ngreater  efforts  to  address  the  financial  insolvency  problems  of  the  Karachi  local  government \nbodies.  A  specific  lesson  derived  from  the  previous  Karachi  Urban  Development  Project  is  that \nurban upgrading is complex and must be able to deal with the broad range of problems faced by \nkatchi  abadis  dwellers,  including  that  of  regularization  and  security  of  tenure.  All  these  lessons \nsuggest that urban development assistance demands a holistic approach. To be of lasting value, \nmajor capital investments need to be supported by capacity building, policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional reforms, as well as new and innovative financing vehicles that facilitate provision of \nhigh-quality  infrastructure  services  on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  proposed  project  incorporates \nthese lessons into its design.  \n\n5. \n\nSummary of the Rationale \n\n \n \n35. \nThe  economy  and  population  of  Karachi  have  expanded  significantly,  but  provision  of \ninfrastructure and services has not kept pace with this rapid growth in the absence of funds and \nadequate mega city governance and management systems. Infrastructure and services that are \ninsufficient  and  unreliable  are  adding  to  business  and  household  costs,  hurting  Karachi\u2019s  urban \nand  natural  environments,  and  decreasing  the  city\u2019s  global  competitiveness  compared  with \nalternative Asian mega cities.  \n \n36. \nDevolution has provided opportunities for effective service delivery but left many issues to \nbe addressed in areas such as (i) fiscal imbalance, limited revenues, and unclear and incomplete \nallocation  of  responsibilities  between  levels  of  government;  and  (ii)  the  inadequacy  of  the  city\u2019s \nand  towns\u2019  financial  and  technical  capacities  to  fully  meet  their  new  responsibilities  within  the \ndevolved framework. There is need for substantial and long-term capacity building at the city level \nif  the  devolution  is  to  yield  the  intended  benefits  for  improved  governance  and  more  effective \nurban service delivery. There is also increasing recognition that the growing gap between urban \ninfrastructure demand and current supply cannot be met through traditional government sources, \nincluding  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and  transfers  from  the  higher  levels  of \ngovernment.  Alternative  sources  of  financing  and  new  ways  of  providing  infrastructure  and \nservices  are  required.  Provision  of  urban  infrastructure  services  need  to  be  placed  on  a  fully \ncommercial and self-sustaining basis. Meanwhile, necessary regulatory and institutional reforms \nshould be effected.   \n \n37. \n  Previous  external  assistance  in  Karachi  has  been  piecemeal  and  has  not  been  based \nupon an integrated approach to improve urban infrastructure and services on a sustainable basis. \nThe proposed TA loan is intended to address the mega city development needs with a long-term \nand  holistic  approach  through  (i)  building  capacities  at  the  local  level  for  effective  city  planning \nand  management,  (ii)  adopting  and  implementing  commercial  principles  in  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  services,  (iii)  supporting  the  preparation  of  bankable  projects  for  mega  city \ndevelopment  that  may  subsequently  be  funded  by  ADB  in  its  loans  to  Karachi  initially  over  the \nnext  4  years,  and  (iv)  promoting  reforms  for  sustainable  financing.  The  TA  loan  represents  the \nfirst intervention of a long-term assistance from ADB, and it will establish the required foundation \nfor effectively utilizing and sustaining future ADB investments in the mega city.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n \n38. \nThe immense size of Karachi, the magnitude of its investment requirements, and the scale \nof the needs for urban policy and institutional reforms suggest that a traditional approach of one-\noff  projects  will  not  work.  There  is  need  for  a  series  of  appropriately  sequenced  and  integrated \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ninterventions whose cumulative effect will act as a catalyst to speed up the development process \nin Karachi.  \n \n39. \nThe expected impact of the TA loan is an enhanced and sustained contribution of Karachi \nto national development and an improved quality of life for its residents, including the poor. The \nanticipated  outcomes  are  (i)  improved  city  planning,  management,  and  financing;  (ii)  improved \nand  expanded  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  and  (iii)  sustainable  and  efficient  financing  of \nmega city urban infrastructure and services. To these ends, the TA loan will provide resources for \n(i)  building  the  capacities  of  CDGK,  the  TMAs  and  utilities  in  city  planning,  management,  and \nfinancing,  as  well  as  in  adopting  and  implementing  commercial  principles  in  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  assistance  in  preparing  bankable  projects  for  expanding  and \nimproving  mega  city  infrastructure  and  services  that  may  subsequently  be  funded  by  ADB  or \nother  development  partners  in  their  lending  assistance  to  Karachi;  and  (iii)  establishment  and \noperationalization of an SFV for the mega city infrastructure and services. It is expected that the \nTA  loan  will  also  enhance  the  governments\u2019  sense  of  ownership  of  the  investment  projects, \ncapacity building, and institutional reforms.  \n \nB. \n \n40. \n The TA loan comprises four parts: part A: Capacity Building Facility for CDGK, TMAs and \nutilities  in  planning,  managing,  and  financing  urban  infrastructure  and  services;  part  B:  Project \nPreparation Facility; part C: Establishment and Development of SFV; and part D: Support for TA \nLoan Management.    \n\nOutputs \n\nPart A: Capacity Building Facility  \n \n\n \n1. \n \n The objective of part A is to make a pool of resources available to CDGK and other city \n41. \nagencies  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  program.  Areas  for  capacity  building \nhave  already  been  identified  and  may  be  further  reviewed  and  updated  during  the  TA  loan \nimplementation. A priority activity under part A will be organizational development of CDGK and \ncompletion of its transition under the devolution. This will include (i) review and evolution of new \nregulatory  relationships  between  GOS,  CDGK  and  the  TMAs;  (ii)  clarifying  and  developing  the \nfunctional  responsibilities  within  CDGK  and  the  TMAs;  and  (iii)  reorganization  of  CDGK  to \nappropriately  reflect  the  new  mandates.  Other  major  components  of  the  capacity  building \nassistance  are  (i)  financial  management  and  revenue  improvements,  (ii)  enhancing  accounting \nand  establishing  management  information  systems  within  CDGK  and  TMAs,  (iii)  customer \norientation  within  CDGK  and  TMAs,  (iv)  reforms  for  commercialization  of  KWSB,  and  (v) \nrevitalization  of  CCBs  to  promote  community  and  public  partnership  in  the  delivery  of  urban \nservices. These activities will be supported by human resource management and rationalization \nstrategies and training programs. Capacity building assistance will also include support for mega \ncity  planning  through  assistance  in  (i)  building  capacities  for  and  institutionalization  of  strategic \nplanning; (ii) master planning and preparation of a sector investment program; and (iii) developing \nand  implementing  reforms  to  address  the  weaknesses  of  current  planning  practices  in  terms  of \ninstitutional  roles  and  capacities, \nland  management,  development  control  and  building \nregulations. The detailed scope of the subprograms under the capacity building facility is provided \nin Appendix 4. \n \n42. \nTo ensure institutional reform, time-bound reform action plans, to be agreed by GOS and \nCDGK, will be developed at the early stages of the capacity building subprograms. Adherence to \nthese  action  plans  will  be  sought  to  ensure  that  the  capacity  building  assistance  will  bring  a \nchange in the mega city\u2019s governance and management. Investment subprojects will also identify \nthe  required  subsector  reforms  to  provide  the  content  of  policy  dialogue  to  be  pursued  during \nprocessing of the follow-on loans.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPart B: Project Preparation Facility \n  \n\n2. \n \nPart B will provide resources for preparing feasibility studies for bankable projects. It will \n43. \naddress the poor standard of project planning, identification, and preparation, as well as the need \nfor integrated development of investments. The resources for selecting and developing bankable \nprojects will be used flexibly in response to evolving priorities. The feasibility studies will establish \nthe  technical,  financial,  institutional,  economic,  social  and  environmental  feasibility  of  projects \nproposed for funding. The facility will also provide advisory services in developing public-private \nmodalities for financing, constructing, operating and maintaining infrastructure facilities, as well as \nfor preparing and vetting documents related to projects with private-public participation. Particular \nattention will be given to transferring knowledge and skills in project preparation to CDGK and the \nutilities. The studies will be carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines and methodologies to \nassess the financial feasibility, economic benefits, costs, distributional effects, social and poverty-\nreduction  impacts  and  benefits.  They  will  examine  resettlement  costs,  environmental  impacts, \nand  effects  on  gender  equity  and  indigenous  peoples.  Based  on  the  mega  city  infrastructure \nassessments, a number of projects that were identified as high priority are proposed for feasibility \nassessments  under  the  TA  loan.  During  the  TA  loan  implementation,  these  may  be  further \nreviewed and replaced with new projects identified on the basis of agreed criteria, which, in turn, \nwill  become  the  project  prescreening  tool  to  be  employed  by  the  specialized  financing  vehicle. \nWhere  needed,  resources  under  the  project  preparation  facility  may  also  be  used  to  prepare \ndetailed design work to accelerate project implementation. Profiles of the priority subprojects are \nprovided in Appendix 5.  \n \n44.  Water, Sewerage, and Drainage. The subprojects proposed for feasibility study in these \nsubsectors  aim  to  address  the  key  issues  responsible  for  the  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  and \nservices.  Although  a  master  plan  for  water  and  sewerage  is  currently  being  prepared  by  JICA, \nthere is no drainage master plan. The subprojects are directed to enhancing the utility of existing \nsystems and networks through (i) water loss reduction, (ii) sewerage and drainage rationalization \nand  system  strengthening,  (iii)  increasing  sewage  treatment  capacities  to  address  the  major \nenvironmental and health issues caused by water pollution, (iv) preparation of a drainage master \nplan, and (v) developing effective operation and maintenance strategies. These subprojects are \nsupported by advisory studies on tariff reforms and organizational development and by capacity \nbuilding assistance to reinforce the sustainability of rehabilitated infrastructure and services.  \n \nSolid  Waste  Management.  In  this  subsector,  the  proposed  priority  assistance  aims  to \n45. \nsupport  Government  initiatives  in  privatizing  primary  waste  collection  and  disposal,  along  with \nrationalization  and  development  of  the  solid  waste  management  system.  This  involves \n(i) improved  systems  for  contracting  out  management  and  monitoring  of  the  private  sector \ncollection  system;  (ii)  design  of  optimal  arrangements  for  continued  involvement  of  the  informal \nsector in recycling, reuse and recovery of waste; (iii) identification of garbage transfer sites, and \narrangements  for  contracting  out  management  and  monitoring  of  the  bulk  system,  where \npossible,  through  public-private  partnerships;  and  (iv)  determination  of  optimal  landfill  sites  and \nproposals  for  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  sites,  where  feasible,  through \npublic-private partnership. \n \n46. \nRoads  and  Transport.  In  this  subsector,  strategic  emphasis  is  placed  on  mass  transit \nsystems. Proposed assistance includes advisory services to the Mass Transit Cell for (i) a critical \nreview of the 1991 mass transit network proposal and development of a strategy and action plan \nto  fund  the  priority  elements  of  this  network,  (ii)  dissemination  of  information  on  the  plans  and \nobtaining of government and public support for the proposals, (iii) completion of work to ensure \nthat the plans meet government and ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements, and (iv) development of a \nstrategy  for  implementing  the  mass  transit  network  under  a  private-public  partnership  modality. \nWhile the services do not include a transport master plan, close coordination will be maintained \nwith JICA, which intends to prepare the transport master plan. Interventions in the urban transport \nsector  will  also  incorporate  components  for  air  pollution  control  and  air  quality  management, \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nconsidering  that  urban  transport  is  the  biggest  source  of  air  pollution  in  Karachi.  While  the \nstrategic  emphasize  is  on  mass  transit,  it  is  recognized  that  this  development  will  take  time. \nTherefore,  well  justified  investments  for  new  roads  may  also  be  included  among  the  selected \npriority subprojects.                    \n \n47. \nKatchi  Abadis.  To  develop  the  metropolis  as  a  city  without  squatters,  the  slow  pace  of \nupgrading  katchi  abadis  needs  to  be  accelerated  while  complementary  long-term  efforts  are \nrequired  to  address  the  issue  of  their  proliferation.  The  project  interventions  include  a  program \ncombining (i) in situ upgrading of katchi abadis and (ii) a shared strategy for those katchi abadis \nwhose  in  situ  upgrading  presents  difficulties,  through  innovative  and  pro-poor  redevelopment \nschemes  and  mechanisms  to  facilitate  the  access  of  the  poor  to  land  and  services.  It  is  also \nrecognized  that  initiatives  for  katchi  abadis  improvements  must  be  placed  within  a  broader \ncontext  of  (i)  national  urbanization  strategies  to  establish  a  balanced  urban  structure  in  the \nprovince  and  the  country,  (ii)  policies  related  to  migration,  and  (iii)  economic  strategies  to \ngenerate  higher  levels  of  production  and  income  in  other  cities  and  regions  outside  Karachi. \nThese are the mandates of the mega city coordination committee that is chaired by the Planning \nCommission  at  the  national  level.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 6.  \n\n \n\nIt  will  have \n\nloans  and  concessional \n\ntransparent  criteria  applicable  to \n\nPart C: Specialized Financing Vehicle  \n\n3. \n \n48. \nPart  C  will  support  the  establishment  and  operationalization  of  an  innovative  financing \nvehicle to address the needs for long-term and sustainable financing of mega city infrastructure \nand  services.  The  SFV  will  be  a  dedicated  urban  infrastructure  financing  entity  that  provides \n(depending on its design and development stage) concessional and commercial funds to CDGK, \nits utilities, TMAs, and possibly the private sector investing in urban infrastructure and services in \nKarachi  (and  perhaps  in  Sindh).  It  is  envisaged  that  the  role,  products  and  services,  operating \nprinciples, and financial strategy of the SFV will evolve. The specialized financing vehicle will act \nin  the  short  term  as  an  efficient  conduit  for  channeling  funds  to  mega  city  infrastructure  and \nservices. \nfunds. \nCriteria-based  allocation  of  funds  that  is  coupled  with  advisory  services  for  preparing  bankable \nprojects  will  encourage  financial  discipline  and  commercial  principles  in  CDGK  and  its  utilities. \nCDGK  and  the  utilities  that  draw  on  the  resources  of  the  SFV  will  be  expected  to  service  their \nloans  out  of  the  financial  revenues/cash  flows  and  economic  benefits  generated  by  those \ninvestments funded by such loans. When designed and resourced in an appropriate manner, the \nSFV will be an important catalyst in gradually establishing a local debt culture and a reliable credit \ntrack  for  future  borrowings.  Consequently,  it  will  help  CDGK  and  its  utilities  in  their  transition \ntoward commercial financing of infrastructure and services. In the long term, with enhanced local \ncapacities  and  a  maturing  financial  market,  the  SFV  will  act  as  an  agent  to  mobilize  funds  for \nmega city infrastructure from nongovernment sources, including international financial institutions, \ndomestic and international commercial lenders, and capital markets.  \n \nGiven  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  accelerating  the  reforms  for  establishing \n49. \nthe  SFV,  the  feasibility  and  design  of  the  SFV  will  be  undertaken  by  a  parallel  TA  (footnote  7) \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA, which will commence ahead \nof the TA loan implementation, will assess design features, legal structures, strategic road map, \nproduct types and terms for the SFV, and it will include due financial analysis to ensure the SFV\u2019s \nviability and sustainability.  \n \n50.  More  specifically,  the  TA  study  will  undertake  (i)  full  analysis  of  economic  and  financial \nmarket  conditions  and  trends,  as  well  as  coordination  with  PPID;  (ii)  analysis  of  the  potential \nmarket  for  the  SFV,  quality  of  borrowers  and  projects;  (iii)  evaluation  of  design  features  and \nselection of an overall design that best meets Karachi\u2019s needs; and (iv)  selection of an existing \nfinancial intermediary, government and/or private sector partners to work with the TA in preparing \nthe SFV\u2019s detailed design. Further tasks will include completing the market demand analysis and \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nmarketing  plan;  estimating  the  financial  resources  required  to  make  the  SFV  operational  and \nviable;  detailed  financial  analysis,  including  risks  and  uncertainties;  preparation  of  the  business \ncase,  business  plan,  and  strategic  road  map  for  the  SFV;  and  preparation  of  the  operations \nmanual to guide the SFV\u2019s operations. Ownership and management structures of the SFV will be \ncarefully  designed  to  ensure  a  professional  and  autonomous  management  and  a  powerful \nrepresentation  of  stakeholders  at  board  level.  The  intent  is  to  maximize  the  SFV\u2019s  potential  to \nserve  as  a  force  for  reforms  in  Karachi.  Due  attention  will  be  paid  to  analyzing  the  SFV\u2019s  role \nwithin  the  current  governance  framework  to  ensure  that  the  SFV  will  enhance  the  devolved \nstructure. Appendix 7 provides the detailed scope of the feasibility and design of the SFV to be \nprepared under the TA. Also provided is a summary of institutional roles with respect to the mega \ncity urban infrastructure sector and the SFV\u2019s potential role within that framework.  \n \n51. \n Upon completing the feasibility study and design, the TA loan under part C will assist in \nestablishing and operationalizing the SFV (see the sequencing of SFV activities in Appendix 7). \nEarly operation of the SFV would help in marketing its financial products and technical services, \ncompleting high-priority projects to bankable standards, and beginning staff recruitment, training \nand capacity building in order to expand skills, expertise, and domestic and international contacts \nin commercial infrastructure financing. Part C will provide start-up funding (seed money) for the \nSFV  for  the  first  3  years  until  project  flows  and  other  financial  products  and  services  begin  to \ngenerate significant revenues. Funding would decline through time as the SFV begins to generate \nrevenues. Funding for year 1 would support a unit of 15 people, including salaries, benefits, and \nother  administration  costs  as  well  as  significant  funding  for  capacity  building  and  training.  The \nsubsidies in years 2 and 3 would cover the costs of about 10 and five staff, respectively, and the \nadditional  training  in  those  years.  The  seed  money  could  be  repaid  once  the  SFV  becomes \nprofitable.  \n \n \n \n52. \nPart D will include consultancy support to the project support unit (PSU) to be established \nin  the  Sindh  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  and  the  project  working  group  (PWG)  and  local \nsupport unit (LSU) in CDGK. A core team of experts comprising three international advisors in (i) \nurban  governance  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  finance,  and  (iii)  infrastructure  planning  and \nengineering  will  be  hired.  These  advisors  will  be  supported  by  long-term  local  consultants.  The \ncore team will assist the PSU, PWG, and LSU in managing and implementing the overall project. \nThe PSU in the DOF will be supported in overseeing the TA loan and implementing part C. The \nPWG  and  LSU  in  CDGK  will  be  assisted  in  (i)  ensuring  coordination  between  various  activities \nand studies of parts A and B; (ii) further refining the scope of the parts A and B and finalizing the \nscope  of  activities  and  terms  of  reference  (TOR);  (iii)  determining  the  prioritization  of  project \nfeasibility and other studies to be carried out; and (iv) finalizing detailed TORs for the subprojects \nand  studies,  preparing  requests  for  proposals,  and  evaluating  technical  proposals  for  engaging \nconsultants. At the outset, priority activities of the team will be to review the scope of the TA loan \n(especially parts A and B), review the scope of each study and subproject, and make justified and \nnecessary adjustments and revisions in the overall scope of parts A and B and individual studies \nand  subprojects.  Facilitating,  coordinating,  and  monitoring  the  development  and  implementation \nof reform action plans under the capacity building programs will form a critical task of the team. \nThe  team  will  also  be  responsible  for  assisting  the  PSU  and  LSU  in  evaluating  the  outputs  of \nconsultants for various subprojects. The detailed scope of part D is given in Appendix 8.  \n \nC. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $13.33 million equivalent, comprising foreign \n53. \nexchange costs of $6.460 million and local currency costs of $6.870 million equivalent (Table 1). \nTaxes and duties are included in these costs and relate to the equipment purchases under each \nsubproject.

The loan \nwill  have  a  term  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as will be set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ADB loan will cover 100% of the \nforeign exchange cost and 51% of the local currency cost, excluding taxes. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2.  \n \n55. \nThe  borrower  will  be  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  which  will  re-lend  to  the  GOS  on  the \nsame financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. Counterpart funds of $3.33 million \n(25%)  will  be  financed  by  the  GOS  and  will  cover  local  currency  costs.  Counterpart  funds  are \nexpected  to  cover  items  such  as  (i)  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  (ii)  local  travel,  (iii) \nequipment  and  materials,  (iv)  surveys  and  data  gathering,  (v)  taxes  and  duties,  and  (vi)  other \nmiscellaneous  costs.  As  most  of  these  funds  will  be  provided  in  kind,  the  availability  of \ncounterpart  financing  should  not  be  an  issue.  Availability  of  sufficient  counterpart  funds  and \nresources to cover these costs was confirmed.  \n \n\nTable 2:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n6.46 \n0.00 \n6.46 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n3.54 \n3.33 \n6.87 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n10.00 \n 3.33 \n13.33  \n\nShare \n(%) \n\n75 \n25 \n100 \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Sindh \n     Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\n \nTA Loan Management  \n\n \n56. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be the DOF of the GOS. With the capacity, \nmandate, and a cadre of professional staff able to provide strategic and policy guidance, the DOF \nwill be a powerful champion for the Project and especially able to guide development of the SFV. \n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe EA will be responsible for overseeing the overall project as well as implementing part C. In \naddition,  the  EA  will  engage  the  consultants  for  part  D  in  consultation  with  CDGK.  A  dedicated \nPSU  will  be  established  in  the  DOF  and  staffed  with  suitably  qualified  personnel.  The  Project \nDirector  of  the  PSU  will  be    a  senior  ranking  officer  grade  BS.  19/20  from  DOF,  Sindh. \nConsultants who will assist in designing the SFV will be based in the DOF.  \n \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  Government  of  Sindh\u2019s  Minister  of \n57. \nFinance, will be formed. It will include the Minister, Planning and Development, Sindh; Minister, \nLocal Government, Sindh; Nazim (Karachi city mayor), Additional Chief Secretary (Development); \nPlanning  and  Development,  Sindh;  Secretary  Finance,  Sindh;  Secretary  Local  Government, \nSindh; District Coordination Officer of CDGK, Project Director, PSU, and two representatives from \nNGO/academia. The project director, PSU will also act as the secretary of the PSC. The PSC will \nprovide  policy  support,  oversee  project  progress,  facilitate  coordination  and  cooperation  among \nagencies  concerned,  and,  more  importantly,  ensure  the  timely  undertaking  of  reform  actions  to \nestablish  and  operationalize  the  SFV  and  to  implement  revenue  mobilization  and  financial \nmanagement reforms at the CDGK and TMA levels. The committee will meet quarterly, or upon \nrequest  by  any  of  its  members.  The  Government  may  also  form  a  committee  to  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  part  C.  The  committee  shall  be  chaired  by  Adviser  to  Prime  Minister,  on \nFinance/Minister of Finance. \n     \n58. \nCDGK will be the implementing agency for parts A and B (Capacity Building and Project \nPreparation facilities). A project working group (PWG), chaired by the district coordination officer \nand  comprising  executive  district  officers  and  managing  directors  of  CDGK  departments  and \nutilities, will be formed to provide oversight for operational matters related to parts A and B and \ncoordinating  with  part  C.  The  PWG  will  meet  bimonthly  and  be  responsible  for  approving  the \nprioritization  of  subprojects,  final  TORs,  and  consultant  selection  under  parts  A  and  B  prior  to \ntheir submission to the PSU for onward transmittal to ADB. The PWG will be responsible also for \nthe  review,  approval,  and  timely  implementation  of  reform  action  plans  prepared  under  the \nsubprograms  of  the  capacity  building  facility.  Coordination  with  the  TMAs  will  be  maintained \nthrough an ad hoc district-town coordination committee chaired by the district coordination officer \nand  consisting  of  chief  officers  of  TMAs.  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  ensure  that \nfeedback is obtained from the TMAs regarding subproject prioritization and selection.  \n\n59. \nThe LSU will be established in the Department of Finance and Planning  of CDGK. It will \nbe led by a director who will be a senior officer of Sindh not less than grade BS.19 with suitable \nqualifications and experience. LSU will plan, coordinate, and monitor the activities and individual \nprograms  of  part  A  (Capacity  Building  Facility) and  part  B  (Project  Preparation  Facility)  that  will \nmainly  be  implemented  by  the  individual  subproject  units  in  the  respective  CDGK  sector \ndepartments.  The  LSU,  in  consultation  with  relevant  sector  departments  and  utilities,  will \nundertake  for  submission  to  PWG  the  preparation  of  proposals  for  prioritizing  subprojects, \nfinalization  of  TORs,  and  engagement  of  consultants.  It  will  also  be  responsible  for  conducting \norganization-wide capacity building programs (such as the organizational development program). \nUpon prioritization of a subproject for feasibility and/or other study, subproject units (SUs) will be \nformed  in  the  respective  sector  departments  and  utilities.  Appendix  10  provides  a  project \norganization chart. \n \nAn  objective  of  utilizing  the  TA  loan  modality  is  to  ensure  increased  government \n60. \nownership  of  CDGK  capacity  building  reforms,  reforms  for  innovative  financing,  and  project \npreparatory  program  and  activities.  It  is  expected  that  through  implementing  the  subprojects \nunder the TA loan, CDGK will increase its capacity to address substantial project preparation and \nsector development issues.  \n \n61. \n\nThe specific criteria utilized in selecting subprojects require that a subproject must \n(i) \n\nhave  been  identified  and  prepared\u2014at  least  to  project  concept  stage\u2014by  a  city \ndistrict department and/or affiliated utility/company;  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nbe  based  on  a  current  or  recent  sector  strategy,  sector  master  plan  or  roadmap \nand the CDGK\u2019s medium-term development plan; \nbe  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  objectives  as  stated  in  the  current  country  strategy  and \nprogram (CSP) or CSPU; \nbe organizationally and technically feasible; \nbe financially and economically viable and sustainable; \nbe  environmentally  responsible;  e.g.,  all  impacts  should  be  mitigated  and,  if \nnecessary, an environmental assessment should be prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); \nbe socially responsible; e.g., a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) will be prepared under each subproject, and, if \nnecessary,  an  assessment  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous People (1998); and  \nbe implementable during the project period. \n\n \n62. \nAll follow-on projects that arise from successfully completed subproject feasibility studies \nand that are selected for further financing by ADB must have their feasibility studies reviewed by \nthe  LSU/PWG/PSU  and  ADB.  The  standard  subproject  proposal  form  to  be  used  by  the  LSU \nwhen presenting the respective subproject proposal to the PSU is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period \n\n \nThe overall implementation schedule for the TA loan is 4 years, and it is expected to be \n63. \nimplemented  from  January  2006  to  January  2010.  The  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 12. It is expected that most capacity building subprojects will start at the initial stages of \nthe  implementation,  with  the  mega  city  planning  and  organizational  development  subprojects  to \nbe  implemented  at  the  earliest.  With  the  assistance  of  TA  loan  management  consultants,  the \nschedule of subprojects will be further reviewed and finalized at the outset of the implementation \nto  ensure  that  (i)  capacity  building  is  provided  only  when  duties  and  responsibilities  are  clear \n(following  organizational  development  activities),  (ii)  subprojects  which  need  to  be  justified  in \nterms  of  the  master  plan  are  only  taken  forward  once  this  work  is  completed,  and  (iii)  logical \nsequencing  and  linkage  between  the  feasibility  studies  and  relevant  capacity  building  activities \nare established in order to ensure integrated and coherent development.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n64. \nAll  goods  and  services  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The EA and IA will determine the required goods and services and \nsubmit their requests for ADB approval. As most procurement is expected to be for routine office \nand administrative equipment with an estimated value of less than $100,000, and because this is \nmost efficiently acquired off the shelf, direct procurement procedures are recommended. Supply \ncontracts  for  equipment  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  will  follow  international  competitive \nbidding, while contracts of $500,000 or less will follow international shopping procedures.      \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nThe LSU, in close consultation with subproject units and under the authority (for approval) \n65. \nof  the  PWG,  will  be  responsible  for  processing  consultant  recruitment  to  undertake  feasibility \nstudies, capacity building, or other technical assistance work under parts A and B. The PSU will \nbe  responsible  for  consultant  recruitment  activities  related  to  part  C.  Consultants  can  be  either \ninternational  or  domestic  firms,  individuals,  or  training  institutions,  and  these  will  provide  the \nrequired  services  in  accordance  with  the  TOR  for  each  subproject.  Such  subprojects  include \n(i) advisory services and technical assistance to CDGK and other city agencies on specific sector \nissues;  (ii)  capacity  building  programs;  (iii)  city  planning  studies;  (iv)  preparation  of  subproject \nfeasibility  studies;  (v)  preparation  of  subproject  detailed  designs,  bidding  documents,  and \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nevaluation  (for  a  few  priority  projects  only,  as  normally  detailed  design costs  would  be  included \nunder the main loan); (vi) development of a public-private modality for the financing, construction, \noperating  and  maintaining  of  infrastructure  facilities;  (vii)  preparation  and  vetting  of  documents \nrelating to such projects involving private-public participation; (viii) preparation of environmental, \npoverty, and social assessments, resettlement plans, and indigenous people\u2019s development plans \n(as  required),  and  (ix)  such  other  consulting  services  in  relation  to  Project  as  agreed  between \nADB and Government.  \n \n66. \nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. ADB will review and approve the processing of consultant recruitment. Supervision \nof consultants\u2019 work and monitoring of subprojects will be carried out by the LSU in cooperation \nwith  SUs  in  the  respective  sector  departments  and  utility  agencies.  Logistical  support  will  be \nprovided to the consultants, and outputs will be reviewed by the LSU in close coordination with \nSUs. Each consultant contract is viewed as an independent event, and it is subject to evaluation \nby  the  LSU,  review  and  approval  by  the  PWG/PSU,  and  agreement  by  ADB.  In  cases  where  it \nemerges  that  the  SU  and/or  PWG/PSU  find  consultants\u2019  performance  to  be  unsatisfactory,  the \nPWG/PSU reserves the right, subject to ADB's agreement, to terminate the contract and recruit \nnew  consultants  for  further  subproject  work.  Tentative  estimates  for  the  entire  TA  loan  are  for \napproximately  145  and  430  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting  services, \nrespectively,  with  regard  to  the  combined  capacity  building,  planning  and  feasibility,  and \nengineering studies. These estimates are flexible and may be reviewed during implementation. \n \n67. \nConsultant  firms  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures or quality-based selection procedures, depending upon which is most suitable for the \nparticular subproject. In some cases where it can be reasonably justified, direct selection may be \nnecessary. Quality-based selection may be required in cases where the technical expertise is the \noverriding  requirement.  A  set  of  outline  TORs  for  all  major  capacity  building  and  priority \nengineering subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix B. These TORs will be further reviewed, \nand additional refinements are expected prior to issuing requests for proposal documents, which \nwill include the detailed TORs. \n\n \n68. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  GOS  and  CDGK  have  requested  advance  action  in \nengaging consultants for part D: Support for TA Loan Management and some subprojects of high \npriority.  Engagement  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  stage  of  evaluating  the  technical \nproposals. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n69. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government, \nGOS  and  CDGK.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  GOS,  CDGK  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n6. \n \n70. \nImmediately  upon  loan  effectiveness,  the  GOS  will  open  and  maintain  a  project  imprest \naccount for PSU at National Bank of Pakistan to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nimplementation.  The \n\nexpedite  project \nimprest  account  shall  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January \n2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Borrower \nand  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent  of  six  months  of  estimated  expenditures.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for the Project and to liquidate \nadvances  provided  into  the  imprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $50,000.  The  loan  proceeds  may  also  be \ndisbursed directly to the consultants under the direct payment procedure.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Report \n\n \n71. \nEach subproject unit will monitor and evaluate project performance in accordance with the \nTORs and the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1, and it will report progress through \nLSU  to  PWG.  Primary  monitoring  targets  will  be  agreed  between  the  PSU  and  PWG  for  each \nsubproject in consultation with ADB, and these  targets will be used by the subproject units and \nreported to the PWG, PSU, and ADB in accordance with the established reporting schedule. \n \n\n8. \n\nReports \n\n \n72. \nThe PSU will monitor project and subproject executions to provide a basis for reporting to \nGOS  and  ADB.  Monthly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  will  be  submitted  by  LSU \nthrough PWG to the PSU. The reports will contain sufficient information to enable the PSU and \nPWG  to  monitor  progress,  identify  issues,  and  ensure  compliance  with  the  objectives  of  the \nsubprojects. Monthly progress reports will be consolidated by PSU into quarterly progress reports \nfor  submission  to  ADB.  These  quarterly  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress \nmade  against  established  targets,  (ii)  problems  and  issues  encountered  and  remedial  actions \ntaken or proposed to resolve the issues, and (iii) proposed project activities to be undertaken as \nwell  as  progress  expected  during  the  subsequent  implementation  period.  Each  report  will  also \ncontain an executive summary with format and content allowing ADB staff to readily capture key \ninformation for use in project performance reports. TA loan management consultants at the outset \nwill prepare a format that reflects the unique features of the TA loan implementation and relevant \nsets  of  data  and  information.  Consultants  are  also  expected  to  provide,  as  necessary,  more \ndetailed reports for the PWG, PSU, and ADB review missions. In addition, the draft final report of \neach subproject will be submitted by PSU to ADB for review.  \n \n73. \nThe  LSU,  together  with  each  SU,  will  prepare  a  subproject  completion  report  for  each \nsubproject within 3 months of submitting the draft final report for the relevant subproject and will \nforward it through the PWG/PSU for ADB\u2019s review. This report should contain detailed information \nconcerning  the  implementation  and  outcome  of  the  relevant  subproject  and  evaluate  how \neffectively  the  subproject  has  addressed  the  requirements  of  the  respective  TOR.  The  TA  loan \nproject  completion  report  will  be  provided  by  the  PSU  within  3  months  of  the  completed \ndisbursement. \n \n\n9. \n\nEvaluation of Consultants Reports \n\n \n74. \nThe  PSU  and  ADB  will  review  and  provide  comments  to  the  consultants  on  the  interim \nand draft final reports of feasibility and other advisory studies. With respect to capacity building \nsubprojects  as  well  as  the  SFV,  ADB  will  be  actively  engaged  throughout  the  progress  of  the \nprojects.  ADB  will  be  especially  active  in  regard  to  those  that  have  policy  and  sector  reform \nimplications.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review and Accounts and Audits \n\n \nADB  will  conduct  regular  project  reviews  of  the  TA  loan,  facilities  utilization,  and \n75. \nsubprojects  to  respond  to  significant  fund  underutilization  and  the  need  for  fund  reallocation,  if \nany. A midterm project review will be undertaken halfway through the TA loan implementation to \nassess the overall implementation progress and achievements made to date. \n \n76. \nThe  LSU  and  PSU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made on the TA loan, including expenditures for \nequipment  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  These  TA  loan \naccounts and related financial statements, as well as the statement of expenditure procedure, will \nbe audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe  Government  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  to  ADB \nwithin 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\ninvestment  projects.  The  subprojects  will  address \n\n \n77. \nThe  population  of  the  mega  city,  including  both  households  and  businesses,  will  have \nsustainable benefits from improved governance and CDGK\u2019s enhanced capacities for mega city \nplanning,  management,  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services.  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough (i) organizational development of CDGK by clarifying roles and responsibilities within the \ndevolved  structure;  (ii)  managerial  and  technical  capacity  improvements;  (iii)  improved  financial \nplanning, budgeting, monitoring and reporting, as well as enhanced local revenues; (iv) improved \ncustomer  orientation  and  corporate  reforms  within  CDGK,  utilities,  and  TMAs;  and  (v) \nparticipatory  urban  service  delivery  and  improved  public,  private,  and  community  partnership  in \nurban service provision through activation of the CCBs.  \n \n78. \nThe  TA  loan  through  the  project  preparation  facility  will  support  Karachi\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction by efficient and timely provision of funds and assistance for \npreparing  bankable \nthe  high-priority \ninfrastructure  investment  needs  as  well  as  the  needs  of  poor  settlements  that  make  up  a \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  city.  The  immediate  beneficiary  will  be  the  CDGK,  as  its  project \npreparation  capacity  will  improve  to  international  standards.  CDGK\u2019s  gains  will  also  include \nimproved  governance  and  transparency  in  consultant  selection  and  procurement,  as  consultant \nengagement and procurement will follow ADB guidelines that ensure transparent and competitive \nprocesses. \n \n79. \nThe TA loan will ensure sustainable development of the mega city by helping to establish \nand  operationalize  a  viable  specialized  mega  city  financing  vehicle,  which  will  (i)  act  as  an \nefficient conduit for channeling funds to mega city infrastructure development, (ii) be an important \ncatalyst and promoter in accelerating commercialization of urban infrastructure service providers, \nand (iii) in the medium-to-long term, mobilize funds from alternative nongovernment sources. The \nultimate beneficiaries will be the residents and businesses of not only Karachi but the country as \na whole, as Karachi\u2019s contribution to the economy goes beyond the city and province. \n \n80.  Major potential risks include those related to (i) possible delays in project implementation \ndue  to  inadequate  capacities  of  CDGK,  (ii)  possible  delays  in  government  reform  actions  to \nimplement the proposed improvements under the capacity building component, and (iii) possible \nlack of cooperation from civil society and nongovernment organizations.  \n \nTo mitigate possible delays in project implementation, the Project provides support for TA \n81. \nloan  management  whereby  a  core  team  of  experts/advisors  are  to  be  engaged  at  the  outset  of \nthe  Project  to  assist  PSU,  PWG,  and  LSU  in  reviewing  and  revising  the  scope  of  components, \nprioritizing  the  subprojects,  finalizing  the  TORs,  recruiting  consultants  and  evaluating  the \nconsultant outputs.   \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n82. \nThe  risk  of  delay  in  government  actions  to  implement  the  proposed  reforms  for \norganizational  development,  revenue  enhancement  and  financial  management,  corporatization, \nand customer orientation will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s close supervision of implementation. ADB will \nbe  actively  engaged  throughout  the  progress  of  the    capacity  building  subprograms,  and \nespecially regarding those that have policy and sector reform implications. Each subprogram will \nidentify time-bound actions to be taken by GOS and CDGK in the early stages and these will form \nthe  content  of  the  policy  dialogue  between  ADB,  CDGK  and  GOS.  Moreover,  the  PSC  will \nexercise its considerable clout to ensure timely undertaking of the reform actions.  \n \nFinally, there  is  an  additional  risk  of  poor  cooperation  from  civil  society  (i.e.,  NGOs  and \n83. \ncommunity-based organizations) in implementing the TA loan. ADB will engage actively with the \nprovincial and city governments to effectively address this potential issue through policy dialogue \nand involving nongovernment stakeholders\u2014such as the business community, NGOs, and other \norganizations\u2014in implementing the TA loan.  \n    \n84. \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguard  Issues:  The  TA  loan  is  not  expected  to  have  any \nadverse environmental or social impacts in relation to its capacity building and project preparation \nactivities.

As CDGK has limited \ntechnical ability to supervise and manage ongoing \nand planned assistance, advisory services will be \nprovided to the Master Plan Group of Offices (MPGO) \nof CDGK to help in this respect. The objective would \nbe to assist the MPGO in ensuring that the \nconsultants complete the work according to \ninternationally acceptable quality standards. \n \nSecond, the City of Karachi needs assistance to \nstrengthen its development strategies and plans by \nbuilding capacities for formulating a city strategic \nplan. Specific emphasis will be given to (i) \nstrengthening the linkages between economic \ndevelopment and physical and infrastructure \nplanning, poverty reduction and environmental \nimprovement; (ii) the financing requirements of \ninvestment plans and their implications for revenues, \nlocal government debt, and other key indicators; and \n(iii) fully engaging all government and nongovern-\nment stakeholders in the process. CDGK officials and \nlocal consultants will play the main roles in preparing \nthe vision and strategy, although they will be guided \nby one or more foreign consultants having extensive \nexperience in preparing strategic plans. \n \nAssistance will involve a number of workshops \nfocused on disseminating experience and outcomes \nof the strategic planning process. The exercise \nshould lead to a concrete and agreed urban \ninvestment plan by consolidating a number of sector \nplans and developing consensus in regard to them.  \n \nThe third component will develop strategies and \naction plans to address the weaknesses of current \nplanning, including the presently fragmented \ndevelopment and building control regulations.  \n\nAn implementable master \nplan that has broad-based \nsupport within CDGK and \nsenior governments and with \nnongovernment \nstakeholders \n \nA shared vision across all \nstakeholders on Karachi\u2019s \nfuture, and consensus \nacross stakeholders in and \noutside government on the \nstrategies and actions \nneeded to achieve Karachi\u2019s \nfuture goals, and on the \nroles and responsibilities of \neach stakeholder group in \nstrategy implementation \n \nA medium-term mega city \nurban infrastructure and \nservices investment plan  \n \nGreater understanding of \nand knowledge within \nCDGK, senior governments \nand nongovernment \nstakeholders of strategy \ndevelopment, as well as \nimplementation and \narrangements to make it a \nregular practice; a stronger \nMPGO. \n \nA strategy and time-bound \naction plan to address broad \nplanning issues related to \ninstitutional aspects, land \nmanagement,and \ndevelopment and building \ncontrol \n\nThere should be \nsignificant coordination \nbetween the first two \ncomponents, and the \nmaster plan process \nshould be designed to \nbenefit from outputs of the \nvision and strategy \ncomponent, and visa \nversa. \n \nThe component will \nrequire qualified urban \nplanners with practical \nexperience in the \npreparation and execution \nof urban structure and \nstrategic plans (preferably \nfor mega cities).  \n \nThe vision and strategy \ncomponent will entail a \nparticipatory process \ninvolving all key \nstakeholders from the \nfederal, provincial, city \nand town governments, \nprivate sector, the \ncommunity, NGOs, and \nthe academia, as well as \nthose cantonment boards \nand defense authorities.  \n \nOther development \npartners, especially the \nJapan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation \nand Japan International \nCooperation Agency, will \nbe closely involved in \nstrategy development.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Implementation of Accounting and MIS Systems \n\nStandardization of accounting and related \nprocedures and systems within the CDGK.  \n \nThere are different accounting systems and \nprocedures in operation in the CDGK, while \nthe towns have only simple manual \naccounting systems with no integration with \nCDGK or Sindh Provincial Government. \nFinance and Planning Department of CDGK \nhas a number of its key accounting activities \ncomputerized. However, a number of key \nactivities are not reported and information is \nnot available within CDGK on a real-time \nbasis. Property tax records are manually \nmaintained.  \n \nThe accounting and MIS systems are \nneeded to facilitate performance monitoring \nand evaluation, budgetary control of \nactivities, financial planning, and \nestablishment of CDGK commercial services \nas autonomous profit centers.  \n \nFor a municipality of CDGK\u2019s size, reliance \non manual accounting systems for many of \nits functions does not allow for providing \naccurate and timely financial information \nupon which CDGK can manage its affairs. \n \nThe consequence is a lack of information \nand poor financial reporting and monitoring \nat each level of the city government.  \n\nIt is proposed under the organizational study that \nuser requirements will be identified and requests for \nproposals will be advertised. Tenders will be \nsubmitted, evaluated and a contract signed with the \nsuccessful tenderer for the provision of accounting \nand MIS software and hardware, installation, testing, \nhandover, training and ongoing support. This \nsubproject provides funds for installing the proposed \naccounting and MIS systems. On the accounting \nside, the system focuses on proper recording of \ntransactions and timely and accurate provision of \ninformation.  \n \nImplementation of the accounting and MIS will be \nundertaken as a single contract on a turnkey basis. \nThis will be based on tenders following the RFP to be \nprepared under the organization study. The tender \nand contract would cover the following elements: \nhardware requirements, mainframes, servers, \nworkstations, printers, desktops, purchase of \nsoftware, modification and license fees, consultancy \nsupport for system installation, setup, testing, staff \ntraining, and support to software and hardware (for 3 \nyears). \n  \nIn developing and installing these systems, particular \nattention will be given to the various accounting \nsystems now in place in CDGK. \n \nAs noted above, this subproject also includes a major \ncapacity building activity. The necessary consulting \ninput will be provided within the successful tender \n\nAn integrated \naccounting system to \nmeet CDGK\u2019s \nfinancial and \nmanagement \nrequirements and a \nproper MIS system to \ncapture both technical \nand financial \ninformation, in order \nto provide necessary \nmanagement \nreporting, budget \ncomparisons, project \nmonitoring, and year-\nend financial \nreporting systems. \n \nThe integrated \naccounting system \nwill, in turn, result in \nmore timely, accurate \nand effective \nmanagement and \ndecision making, \nmore efficient and \neffective operations, \nand better delivery of \nservices to CDGK \nand TMA clients and \ncitizens. \n\nThe necessary \nconsulting \ninput will be \nprovided within \nthe successful \ntender to \nprovide for the \ninstallation, \ntesting, \nhandover, \ntraining, and \nongoing \nsupport of \naccounting and \nMIS systems \nfor CDGK and \nthe towns.

This initiative is in \npartnership with the Swiss Development \nCorporation (SDC), which has made a \npreliminary commitment of $580,000 to support \nthis activity, starting in July 2005. This assistance \nis designed to improve accountability in service \nprovision (including regulatory frameworks and \nthe restructuring of service providers) through \ninstitutional reforms and enhanced accountability \nto consumers.  \n \nIts purpose is to make institutional reforms to \nimprove access to and the quality of water \nsupply and sewerage services in Karachi. The \nassistance is expected to address planning and \nservice delivery, the KWSB\u2019s HRM practices, \nand political and operational accountability in the \ndelivery of water supply and sewerage services. \nThese activities are also designed to enhance \nthe creditworthiness of the KWSB, thereby \nattracting greater domestic private sector interest \nin financing future KWSB activities. \n \nThis assistance represents a critical first step in \n\nTogether with the main \nfindings and actions from \nthe institutional \nstrengthening assistance, \na long-term strategy for \nsustainable \ncommercialization. This \nstrategy will position \nKWSB to attract and \nrepay funds of ADB, other \ninternational finance \ninstitutions, and \ncommercial lenders, as \nwell as to establish \nmutually beneficial public-\nprivate partnerships with \nprivate partners.  \n \nIn the long term, the \npotential for a successful \npartial or complete \nprivatization that would \nprovide a good asset price \nto government \nshareholders and would \nensure that the needs of \ncustomers and other \n\nWork should coordinate with \nthe World Bank/SDC \nassistance so that this \ncapacity building team can \nbenefit from interactions with \nthe earlier team and from \nparticipation at its final \nworkshops.  \n \nCapacity building team will \nbe hosted by KWSB and \ninteract on a daily basis with \nsenior management and key \nprofessional and technical \nstaff in the Board. \n \nClose coordination will also \nbe needed with the teams \nresponsible for other \ncapacity building, project \npreparation, and \nestablishing the specialized \nfinancing vehicle  under the \nTA loan.

Revitalization of Citizen Community Boards  \n\nActivation of CCBs to \nundertake infrastructure \ndevelopment at the \ncommunity level. \n \nUnder the SLGO-2001, 25% \nof the annual development \nfunds of every town and \ndistrict government are to be \nutilized for various \ndevelopment projects \nthrough the citizen \ncommunity boards (CCBs). \nCurrently, there is quite a \nlarge amount of undisbursed \nfunds of the CDGK and \ntowns that has accumulated \nover the past 3 years \nbecause CCBs were either \nnot activated or not formed.  \n\nThe project will undertake a review of \ncurrent literature on the methodologies \nfor activating CCBs and identify lessons \nlearned. It will conduct a detailed \nbusiness process mapping exercise of \nthe procedures to approve funding \nreleases for CCB projects. It will \nconduct a civic education campaign \ninvolving training and capacity-building \nactivities in the (i) implementation, \nmonitoring, and financial management \nof CCB projects and (ii) CCB formation, \nregistration and community contribution. \n \nThe project\u2019s civic education campaign \nwill target CCB\u2019s, communities, and the \nstaff at the district and town levels. Also, \nthe Project will assist in establishing 10 \npilot CCB subprojects for demonstration \nin low- and medium-income \ncommunities to test different methods of \n20% community contribution and to \ndocument those experiences as \nevidence of the strengths and \nweakness of development through \nCCBs. \n\nOutcomes: Fully established and \noperational CCBs that are more \nactive. Better and more efficient \nutilization of past, current, and future \nfunding. Improved services at the \ncommunity level. Stronger voice for \nthe poor and other vulnerable \npopulations in policy development, \nprogram implementation and service \ndelivery. \n \nThe objective of activating CCBs has \nbeen framed around the need to \nstrengthen community participation, \ncost sharing and appropriate \noperation and maintenance of \ndevelopment projects, thus ensuring \n(i) greater decision making for the \npeople, (ii) enhanced accountability, \n(iii) reduced corruption, and (iv) \ndelivering results that improve the \nlives of local people and effectively \nutilize millions of unspent rupees that \notherwise would have remained \nunspent.  \nDeliverables: (i) a study on best \npractices and methods for CCB \nactivation, (ii) civic education \ncampaign and a series of training, (iii) \nestablishment of 10 pilot CCB \nsubprojects for demonstration.   \n\nThe NGO/consultant team will \nbe led by an international \nconsultant with experience in \nsimilar community-based \nprojects. However, most of the \nwork will be conducted by local \ncommunity development staff. \nOne approach that may be \nconsidered is to conduct this \nactivity through a consortium \nof local consultant firms and \nNGOs familiar and \nexperienced in community \ndevelopment, and especially in \ninfrastructure projects in the \nareas of water, sanitation, \nhealth, and education. \nMechanisms will be \nestablished to ensure women\u2019s \ninvolvement and \nrepresentation in the decision-\nmaking and implementation \nprocesses of the program.  \n\nThe entire activity will be \ncompleted within a 30-month \nperiod beginning in the 3rd \nquarter of 2007. \n\nCCC  =  citizen  community  board,  CDGK  =  City  District  Government  of  Karachi,  HRM  =  human  resource  management,  KWSB  = Karachi  Water  and  Sewerage  Board,  MIS  = \nmanagement information system, MPGO = Master Plan Group of Offices, NGO = nongovernment organization, PPID = Private Participation in Infrastructure Development, PPP \n=  public-private  partnership,  RFP  =  request  for  proposal,  SDC  =  Swiss  Development  Corporation,  SLGO  =  Sindh  Local  Governance  Ordinance,  TMA  =  town  municipal \nadministration. \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

The project preparation facility is intended to be used as a flexible tool. A number of \npriority  projects  have  already  been  identified,  but  their  prioritization  is  expected  to  be  firmed  up \nduring  implementation  of  the  TA  loan.  Identification  of  these  subprojects  is  based  on  (i) \nassessment of existing conditions and key constraints to the city\u2019s future growth; (ii) evaluation of \ncity's infrastructure needs1; (iii) assessment of the city\u2019s key constraints and opportunities\u2014at the \npolicy,  strategic  and  operational  levels\u2014identified  in  the  evidence-based  situational  analysis \ncarried  out  under  the  small-scale  TA;  (iv)  the  proposals  contained  in  the    Karachi  revitalization \nscenario  supported  by  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation;  and  (v)  the  programs  and \nprojects  proposed  by  CDGK  and  other  key  stakeholders  in  the  city  through  (a)  the  Tameer-e-\nKarachi  program  and  (b)  the  city\u2019s  midterm  investment  plans  as  well  as  national  and  provincial \ndevelopment  frameworks  for  the  mega  city.  Based  on  the  above  exercise  and  discussions  with \nstakeholders while conducting the small-scale TA, the objectives for mega city infrastructure and \nservices development are established as follow:  \n \n\n(i)  Upgrading  and  extension  of  city  infrastructure  and  services  to  support  economic \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment.  \nImproving  urban  environmental  conditions  through  improved  waste  management, \nbetter  traffic  management,  the  introduction  of  mass  transit  systems,  and  retention \nand enhancement of green open spaces and the coastline. \nIncreased  sustainability  of  infrastructure  and  services  through  improved  cost \nrecovery for services, leading to better-funded and improved management, operation \nand maintenance of services. \n\n(iv)  Releasing so-called \u201cdead capital\u201d held by the urban poor, and attracting it towards \nproductive use through the regularization of katchi abadis and improving the access \nof the poor\u2014and particularly those living in katchi abadis\u2014to basic urban services.  \n\n(v)  Enhancing the resources available to support large-scale infrastructure development \nthrough  attracting  private  sector  resources  in  a  variety  of  public-private  sector \npartnership arrangements as well as promoting commercial financing. \n\n \nIn line with the above objectives and in the absence of some sector master plans, most of \n2. \nthe priority projects identified are directed to enhance the utility of existing infrastructure networks. \nThe following provides background to the proposed priority investment projects.  \n \nWater Supply and Sewerage. The KSWB has already received Asian Development Bank \n3. \n(ADB)  assistance  for  sewerage  and  wastewater  management  improvements,  as  well  as \nassistance  from  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  for  water  supply \nimprovements.  In  addition,  the  Government  is  currently  funding  the  K-III  water  supply \nimprovement  project,  which  will  deliver  an  additional  450,000  cubic  meters  (some  100  million \ngallons)  per  day  to  the  water  supply  network.  However,  critical  system  needs  remain,  the  most \nimportant  of  which  are  (i)  a  new  master  plan  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  to  supersede  the \nexisting  plan  that  only  covered  the  period  up  to  2003,  (ii) system  strengthening  to  reduce  water \nlosses  (50%),  (iii)  augmentation  of  water  treatment  capacity  to  accommodate  the  additional \n450,000 cubic meters per day being delivered to the system under K-III, (iv) rehabilitation of the \nsewerage  system  and  enhancing  utilization  of  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants,  and  (v) \nprovision  of  additional  treatment  plant  capacity  to  accommodate  at  least  part  of  the  wastewater \nflow currently being discharged untreated to the marine environment. \n                                                 \n1  Based  on  a  methodology  that  related  growth  in  per  capita  income  to  the  need  for  enhanced  and  extended  urban \ninfrastructure and service provision, it is estimated that an investment of between $5.0 billion and $1.0 billion (Rs25 \nbillion  to  50  billion)  per  year  is  required  to  maintain  an  adequate  stock  of  infrastructure  in  Karachi.  The  current \nrequirement may be higher than the estimate because of the poor state of Karachi's existing infrastructure stock. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n4. \nDrainage.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has  agreed  to  assist  KWSB  in \npreparing a water supply and sewerage master plan for the period to 2025, and this work will be \ncomplemented by the tariff study and the commercialization reforms proposed under the Project. \nKWSB commissioned a study on water loss reduction in 1995, but funding was not forthcoming at \nthat  time.  It  is  proposed  that  the  Project  conduct  a  review  of  these  proposals,  update \nrecommendations, and propose a phased plan for water loss reduction and system strengthening. \nKWSB has recently assumed responsibility for drainage in the city, since most of the wastewater \ngenerated is discharged to the stormwater system. The project will support a feasibility study to \ndetermine  the  optimal  mechanisms  for  directing  wastewater  flows  currently  discharged  to  the \nstormwater system to the underutilized sewage treatment plants. The project will also update the \nexisting  concepts,  preliminary  designs,  and  feasibility  study  for  the  Korangi  sewer  rehabilitation \nand sewage treatment plant project, which was previously prepared as a prospective project for \nADB funding.  \n \n5. \nSolid Waste Management. While the TMAs have responsibility for collecting solid waste \nfrom  households  and  its  delivery  to  points  of  disposal,  only  about  25%  of  the  solid  waste \ngenerated is disposed of to one of the approved disposal sites. The Government has decided on \na  system  of  garbage  transfer  stations  and  the  Project  will  support  feasibility  studies  for  the \nlocation  and  design  of  such  facilities  based  on  the  pilot  project  funded  under  the  Government \nprogram. This study will also investigate the preferred location and feasibility of a landfill facility for \nthe city, and it will develop mechanisms for funding through private-public partnership \u2013 preferably \nadopting a design-build-operate modality.   \n \n6. \nRoads  and  Transport  System.  Lastly,  the  roads  and  transport  system  in  Karachi  are \ncoming under increasing stress, as private vehicle use is growing dramatically while there are few \nsigns that significant private investment will be attracted to support mass transport systems in the \nimmediate term. The project will initially support feasibility study for the proposed Malir River bund \nexpressway,  which  will  ease  congestion  on  the  Shara-Faisal  and  provide  an  important  new  link \nbetween the city center and the superhighway. The project will also support advisory assistance \nto  the  mass  transit  cell  of  CDGK  to  help  in  determining  the  optimal  approach  for  developing  an \nintegrated mass transit system and attracting private capital to join in partnership with government \nin  developing  mass  transit  systems  for  the  city.

In line with increased water supplies, there is an urgent \nneed to improve cost recovery to finance proper operations and maintenance expenditures to \nensure long-term sustainability of systems, as well as to provide for future routine and \nreplacement capital expenditure and debt service.  \nThe objectives are to develop tariff policies and tariff objectives for urban environmental \nservices in Karachi, as well as structures that both ensure the access of the poor to urban \nservices meeting their basic needs and meet agreed financial objectives. The tariff studies will \nbe carried out in conjunction with Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s (JICA\u2019s) physical \nmaster planning study. In assessing future tariffs, the consultants will take into account future \ninvestment requirements and their possible funding sources. \nThe tariff studies will be conducted over a 9-month period commencing sometime during the \n3rd quarter of 2007 to allow adequate consultation. The tariff studies would commence 3 \nmonths before the completion of JICA\u2019s physical master planning study to allow for discussion \nwith the engineers and to obtain investment plans. Estimated consultancy requirements include \n14 months of foreign consultants and 25 months of local consultants. \nOutputs of the Project will include (i) a comprehensive set of tariff policies and objectives (cost \nrecovery, financial, affordability, economic, environmental) and targets for the water supply, \nsewerage, and solid waste systems in Karachi; and (ii) a detailed financing plan and financial \nprojections for KWSB, incorporating proposed sector investment plans over the next 10 years. \nAsian Development Bank technical assistance loan \nCity District Government of Karachi \n545,000 \n\nFund Modality \nExecuting Agency \nCost ($) \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Since this study, there have \nbeen changes in the water supply situation and network, and investments are now being \nimplemented that will increase the water supplied to the network by 450,000 cubic meters per \nday. This will have further implications on the nature, extent and magnitude of losses. The City \nnow wishes to update the study to reduce UFW and improve overall water supplies, and to \nreview, update and finalize the system strengthening package in light of events since the 1999 \nstudy and the impact of the current K-III project under implementation.  \nVerify and update the basic information used in the previous study and the water loss reduction \nstrategy, water loss reduction program, system strengthening works, costs, and the technical, \nsocial and environmental feasibility of the Project. Poverty, gender equity, indigenous peoples, \nand other social and environmental concerns will be considered. \nAn engineering consulting firm experienced in urban water supply engineering and loss \nreduction is required to assist KWSB with updating the previous study. The proposed \nconsultancy should be completed within 3 calendar months and begin in 2006. It will require 5 \nperson-months of foreign consultants and 8 months of local consultants. \nDuring the study period the consultant shall submit the following: \n(i) \n\nInception report.

The \nProject did not come to fruition, however, due to (i) objections to the concept by nongovernment \norganizations (caused by poor public consultation) and (ii) KWSB\u2019s poor financial performance  \nand reluctance by the Government of Sindh  to take on the loan. In the meantime, the volume of \nwastewater flow in the past 8 years has increased in line with the escalating population and \nindustrial and commercial activity in Korangi. Fortunately, some elements of the proposed \nproject\u2014notably the long-term planning for the sewerage network\u2014have now been taken on by \nother donors (Japan International Cooperation Agency). Nevertheless, ongoing work in the \nsector remains inadequate to address the growing problems facing KWSB. Thus, there remains \nan urgent need to revive the proposed project in order to (i) provide additional sewage treatment \ncapacity to prevent continued discharge of raw sewage to the aquatic and marine environment \nin the Malir River and Girzi Creek, (ii) rehabilitate and extend the sewerage network in the \nLandhi and Korangi areas to collect wastewater, (iii) construct an interceptor sewer to convey \nwastewater from the Landhi/Korangi network to the sewerage treatment plant, and (iv) \ninvestigate the opportunities for private sector involvement in wastewater recycling and reuse \nfor agricultural or industrial purposes. \nReview the feasibility study and design of the wastewater collection and sewage treatment \nproject for Korangi and Landhi (Korangi Wastewater Management Project \u2013 PAK 1539 ). This \nproject was the highest priority investment based on the 1990\u20132000 sewerage master plan. The \nstudy would review the prioritization assumptions made in this master plan, and the proposals \nsubsequently made under the Korangi project, with a view to verifying the assumptions made \nand conclusions reached. The study would provide a revalidated feasibility study for the Project, \nin the light of changes made since 1997, and provide updated analysis, plans, costs and project \npackaging information. \nBeginning in 2006, 4 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services with expertise in wastewater engineering, private sector participation, \nfinancial analysis/economics, environment, social development, and surveying will be required. \nBy the completion of this study, the KWSB will have: \n(i) \n(ii)  a fully revised feasibility study for the proposed project, setting out costs, benefits, likely \n\na revised set of preliminary engineering drawings and project costings; \n\nimpact, and a clear implementation action plan; \n\n(iii)  updated environmental and social impact assessments; and \n(iv)  a clear assessment of the opportunities\u2014and recommendations\u2014 for private sector \n\ninvolvement in the recycling of wastewater for industrial or agricultural use. \n\nFund Modality \nExecuting Agency \nCost ($) \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Only 539 were listed in 1986 for \nregularization  and  upgrading.  Over  the  last  20  years,  just  284  out  of  539  listed  katchi  abadis \nwere notified (2.5% per year) for regularization, and around 45% of dwelling units in the notified \nkatchi  abadis  were  granted  lease  rights.  The  current  backlog  is  around  750  settlements \ncomprising over half a million dwelling units. The size and number of katchi abadis is estimated \nto be growing at 10% per year. To develop the metropolis as a city  without slums, a program \nthat  would  facilitate  and  accelerate  the  notification,  regularization  and  upgrading  of  katchi \nabadis  needs  to  be  implemented.  It  is  also  necessary  to  develop  strategies  and  innovative \nredevelopment schemes for those katchi abadis which cannot benefit from in situ upgrading.    \nThe  project  will  assist  in  mobilizing  the  City  District  Government  of  Karachi  (CDGK),  the \nprovincial  directorate  of  katchi  abadis,  the  town  municipal  administrations,  the  katchi  abadis \ncitizen  community  boards  (CCBs),  and  nongovernment  organizations  in  accelerating  the \nregularization and upgradation process while creating public support for the Government\u2019s drive \nto develop Karachi as a \u201cCity Without Slums.\u201d The emphasis will be on implementing projects \nthat  involve  low  capital  and  operating  costs  but  potentially  high  benefits,  as  measured  by \neconomic, social, and environmental indicators as well as community engagement. The in situ \nupgrading  activity  will  revolve  around  five  themes:  awareness,  capacity  building,  facilitation, \nmobilization, and coordination. The scope will also include developing strategies for innovative \nredevelopment schemes and increasing access by the poor to land, services, and finance. \nIt is proposed that a foreign consultant/advisor with extensive experience in community-based \nprojects to improve urban environmental services, quality of life, and the livelihoods of the poor \nand  other  vulnerable  groups  will  provide  advice  and  oversight  on  the  Project  over  a  period  of \n2 months.  The  initial  reconnaissance  survey  of  katchi  abadis  will  require  12  months  of  local \nconsulting  together  with  support  costs.  The  identification,  preparation,  establishment,  and \nmonitoring  of  pilot  projects  is  estimated  to  require  20  months  of  consulting.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government of Pakistan developed a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy for accelerating growth and \nreducing poverty. The strategy is based on six principles: (i) broad-based participation of stakeholders, (ii) focusing \non monitorable outcomes that benefit the poor, (iii) recognition of poverty\u2019s multi-dimensional nature, (iv) flexible \nimplementation in fiscal and institutional terms, (v) private-public partnership, and (vi) emphasis on the millennium \ndevelopment goals. The strategy rests on four pillars: (i) achieving high and broad-based economic growth while \nmaintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving governance, consolidating devolution, and ensuring social and \neconomic justice; (iii) investing in human capital; and (iv) bringing the poor, vulnerable and backward regions into \nthe  mainstream  of  development,  and  to  make  marked  progress  in  reducing  existing  inequalities.  The  poverty \nreduction  partnership  agreement  signed  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nreflects  the  above  goals  and  principles  and  commits  to  reducing  poverty  by  broadening  community  participation \nand  opportunities  for  the  poor during  the  next  5  years.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan  project  contributes  to \nand  reinforces  the  above  priorities  by  its  project  preparation  facility,  which  makes  funds  available  for  preparing \nprojects for mega city infrastructure and services resulting in an improved quality of life and public health for all city \nresidents, including the poor. Priority subprojects, identified for feasibility studies, include upgrading of the informal \nsettlements known as katchi abadis that will have a direct impact on reducing poverty. The TA loan also supports \nADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  through  its  capacity  building  facility  that  includes  in  its \nscope  a  number  of  programs  highly  relevant  to  the  above  principles.  Among  these  are  (i)  an  organizational \ndevelopment program that intends to enhance the effectiveness of the devolution in the City District Government of \nKarachi (CDGK), and (ii) reactivation of citizen community boards (CCBs) that aims to promote community-public \npartnership  in  infrastructure  development  and  broad-based  participation  of  the  stakeholders  in  mega  city \nmanagement. Finally, the TA loan contributes to sustainable economic growth by establishing and implementing a \nspecialized financing vehicle that will promote sustainable financing of mega city development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nApproximately 50% of the total 12.5 million population of Karachi metropolis live below the poverty line. Another \n8.5% are living above the poverty line but are vulnerable to shocks. The incidence of poverty varies between 40% \nand  57%  in  18  towns  and  cantonment  areas  within  the  metropolis.  Evidence  confirms  the  large  disparity  in  the \nincidence of poverty in developed city areas, at 40%, compared to the 89% occurring in the katchi abadis. Further \nanalysis, however, shows that the proportion of the population living below the poverty line in all cantonments is \n40%,  followed  by  44%  in  planned  and  business  oriented  areas.  It  is  slightly  higher  (at  46%)  in  middle  class \nresidential towns. The highest incidence of poverty is reported in those towns dominated by the working class and \nkatchi abadis (such as 57% in Orangi Town, 53% in Gadap and Landhi Towns, and 52% in Malir Town).   \n \nOver 1,000 katchi abadis account for more than 40% of Karachi total population. A poverty assessment conducted \nunder the small-scale technical assistance to prepare the TA loan indicates that overall 89% of the population in \nthese settlements is living below poverty line. Based on the per capita income levels and the quintile divisions set \nby the Government, 54% of these people are at chronic poverty levels, around 35% are transitory poor, and 11% \nare  in  the category of  transitory  vulnerable.  That  leaves  none  in  the  category of  nonpoor. The  majority of  katchi \nabadis are excluded from social services and the safety net and have to spent significant amounts of their incomes \nto  purchase  water  that  contributes  to  further  impoverishment.  It  is  therefore  safe  to  assume  that  the  entire \npopulation  living  in  katchi  abadis  is  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  assessment  reveals  that  urban  poverty  is \ncharacterized  by  (i)  lack  of  permanent  occupation;  (ii)  insufficient  and  irregular  income;  (iii)  limited  access  to \neducation and health care; (iv) deficiency of such basic infrastructure and services as roads, sanitation, and solid \nwaste collection and disposal systems; (v) inadequate nonfarm employment opportunities; and (vi) lack of secure \nownership  tenure  of  productive  assets.  Conditions  are  unhygienic;  water-  and  feces-borne  diseases  are  highly \nprevalent. This undermines health and income-earning opportunities. In most cases, physical and social exclusion \nact  together,  resulting  in  a  perpetual  cycle  of  poverty.  The  poverty  assessment  indicates  that  the  poor  in  these \nkatchi  abadis  unanimously  prioritize  the  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services  and  low  incomes  as  the  most \nsevere problems that need to be addressed.    \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n45\n\n   No  \n   No \n\n  Yes \n   Yes             \n\nThe TA loan is expected to contribute significantly to poverty reduction by prioritizing subprojects addressing the \nphysical  and  social  barriers  adversely  affecting  the  urban  poor  in  Karachi.  The  specific  features  of  these \nsubprojects include (i) regularization of katchi abadis to provide security of tenure of the land and houses where \nthe  poor  live;  (ii)  upgrading  of  settlements  by  providing  infrastructure,  including  proper  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities;  and  (iii)  promoting  participatory  development  and  public  and  community  partnership  in  upgrading \nsettlements by activating citizen community boards (CCBs).  \n \nThe poverty impact analysis shows that the regularization/security of tenure will directly impact the poor residents \nby relieving them from the stress of living under illegal land occupation and possible eviction. It will increase not \nonly the value of assets but also the confidence level that one is truly a resident of the mega city. Improvements in \ninfrastructure and amenities will directly improve the living environment and health conditions of an estimated 40% \nof the city population. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted during the small-scale technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well \nas  their  roles,  interests,  preferences,  and  aspirations.  The  primary  stakeholders  are  the  residents,  business \ncommunity, and the poor of the mega city. These primary stakeholders will benefit either directly or indirectly from \nTA  loan  interventions,  especially  through  (i)  the  investment  projects  whose  feasibility  and  design  will  be \nundertaken  under  the  project  preparation  facility,  and  (ii)  improved  service  delivery  capacities  of  the  CDGK  and \nother city agencies resulting from the TA loan\u2019s capacity building facility.  \n \nSecondary  stakeholders  include  the  elected  and  appointed  officials  of  the  provincial  (Sindh)  and  city  district \n(Karachi) governments, as well as town municipal administrations, and utility agencies that will be both key players \nin the TA loan implementation as well as the primary recipients of some subprojects under the capacity building \nfacility. All these stakeholders were consulted while preparing the TA loan, and they demonstrated much interest in \nand  support  for  the  Project.  The  inputs  solicited  from  these  stakeholders  were  incorporated  into  the  TA  loan \ndesign. Another group of secondary stakeholders are the representatives of the federal government who indicated \ntheir strong support and provided feedback with regard to the TA loan design.  \n \nStakeholders consulted during implementation of the small-scale TA and processing of the TA loan also include \nrepresentatives of the finance and banking sector, who unanimously supported and provided their input into the TA \nloan  intervention  for  establishment  of  a  specialized  financing  vehicle  for  the  Karachi  mega  city.  Private  sector \nrepresentatives who are likely to be engaged in some urban infrastructure and service provision activities during \nthe follow-on loans phase also expressed their willingness to be involved in the Project. \n \nThe  TA  loan  design  involved  the  participation  of  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders.  Participation  of  the \nstakeholders in the implementation will be ensured through incorporating participation strategy into the design of \neach subproject. The participation strategies will (i) ensure that the improvements are responsive to the demands \nof  city  residents,  including  households,  businesses  and  the  poor;  and  (ii)  develop  in  the  mega  city  a  sense  of \nownership  of  the  TA  loan  interventions,  thereby  strengthening  sustainability.  Secondary  stakeholders  will \nparticipate  through  the  project  implementation  structures (i.e.,  the  executing  agency,  project  steering committee, \nlocal  support  unit,  and  project  working  group)  that  will  involve  key  agencies  at  the  provincial  level  as  well  as \nCDGK\u2019s departments and utilities. \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGiven the dominant role of women in household management, women are expected to be the primary recipients of \nbenefits  from  the  ensuing  follow-on  loans  for  mega  city  infrastructure  and  service  improvements,  especially \nimprovements in the water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management. They will be a major target group for \nthe katchi abadis regularization and upgrading, as well as for vitalization of the citizen community boards. Gender \nanalysis  and  strategy  will  be  parts  of  the  feasibility  studies  of  subprojects.  Strategies  developed  under  the \nsubprojects  will  incorporate  measures  to  promote  full  participation  of  women  in  project  activities\u2014including  in \nproject planning and implementation.  \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f46 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \nE.

An exception to \nthis is found in katchi abadis, where a significant \nnumber of these informal communities developed in \nthe name of some ethnic group or area of migration, \nand gradually those groups came to dominate in \nnumber of houses and local politics. However, there is \nno perceived linkage between poverty and ethnicity. \n \nStrategy: As part of the subproject preparation under \nthe TA loan, and as necessary, measures may be \nadopted to ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit \nequally from ensuing follow-on loans. Selection of \nlocal representatives in CCBs for regularization and \nupgrading of katchi abadis may consider the role of \nethnic leadership and follow the principle of \nproportionate representation of ethnic groups.  \n \nNone \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n 47 \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SPECIALIZED FINANCING VEHICLE \n\nThe following terms of reference are to be the basis for a parallel technical assistance (TA) \n\n \n1. \nseparate from this project and are provided for information only. \n \nA.  Background  \n \n2. \nA small-scale TA,1 which made a preliminary assessment for a specialized financing vehicle \n(SFV), analyzed the positive and negative factors that influence the establishment and operation of \nthe  SFV  in  the  context  of  Pakistan  and  Karachi,  and  it  presented  a  number  of  options  for \nconsideration  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  Government  of  Sindh,  City  District  Government  of \nKarachi (CDGK), and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The options included (i) a totally new and \nspecialized  for-profit  financing  vehicle  that  would  be  (largely)  independent  from  government;  (ii) \nlocating  an  urban  infrastructure  financing  unit  within  an  existing  government-owned  financial \ninstitution (bank or development finance institution) or privately owned financial institution (FI); (iii) \nlocating a specialized for-profit financing vehicle within a nonbank development corporation, such \nas  the  District  Financing  Vehicle  hosted  by  the  Shanghai  Chengtou  Corporation;  and  (iv) \nestablishing a totally new, government-owned, nonprofit SFV similar to US bond banks, Canadian \nmunicipal  financing  corporations,  the  Tamil  Nadu  Urban  Development  Fund,  and  other  municipal \ndevelopment funds established in many industrialized and developing countries. Each option would \nhave  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.  At  the  same  time,  when  appropriately  designed,  resourced, \nand managed, each option would provide broadly similar financial services.  \n \n3. \nThese  findings  created  a  strong  interest  among  senior  government  officials  and  existing \nfinancial  intermediaries  in  the  concept  of  a  nongovernment  urban  infrastructure  financing  vehicle \nthat could develop the market for commercial lending and private financing of urban infrastructure \nin Karachi and Sindh. This interest was confirmed during the TA loan Fact-Finding Mission in late \nAugust and early September 2005 in meetings held first in Islamabad with senior officials from all \nthree  levels  of  government  and  then  in  separate  meetings  in  Karachi  with  senior  officials  of  the \nCDGK  and  the  Sindh  Provincial  Government.  Agreeing  in  principle  with  the  SFV  concept,  as  an \ninnovative financing model needed to replace unsuccessful traditional financing models for urban \ninfrastructure financing, these meetings urged a fast-track process for a feasibility and design study \nfor the SFV. Placing such a study under a separate TA grant to be started as quickly as possible \nwould be supported and appreciated by all three levels of government, and would provide a strong \nsignal  of  ADB\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  urban  infrastructure  development  in  the  mega  city  of \nKarachi. \n \nThere was also some consensus on many of the overall (or conceptual) design features of \n4. \nthe  SFV.  The  SFV  would  be  an  independent,  highly  competent,  professionally  run,  financial \ninstitution  that  operates  on  commercial  principles  and  consistent  with  national  and  international \nbest practice. Also envisaged was a limited company structure under the oversight of the Province \nof Sindh (most likely its Finance Department) and with a long-term business strategy. \n \n5. \nThe mandate and scope for the SFV were considered to include (i) possible coverage of all \ncities in Sindh, (ii) a large number of infrastructure sectors, and (iii) channeling funds to borrowers \nnot only through ADB on-lending but also in the future from other international finance institutions \n(IFIs), bilateral donors, government programs, domestic and international commercial lenders, and \nthe  capital  markets.  Senior  officials  stressed  the  need  for  the  SFV  to  be  very  active  in \n(i) establishing, developing and expanding the market for commercial lending and private financing \nof urban infrastructure, (ii) providing technical and capacity building advice and assistance through \nworking  with  potential  borrowers  to  prepare  bankable  projects  and  to  place  their  operations  on  a \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Mega City Development. Manila. (approved \n\non 11 April 2005 for $150,000, TA 4578-PAK). \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nfully  commercial  basis,  and  (iii)  monitoring  funded  projects  to  ensure  that  the  objectives  of  the \nfunded  projects  and  the  SFV  are  achieved.  The  SFV  is  therefore  envisaged  as  introducing  and \npromoting  a  fully  commercial,  customer-oriented  approach  to  the  financing,  management,  and \noperation of urban infrastructure facilities in Karachi and Sindh.  \n \nThere was full agreement that the effectiveness and success of the SFV would depend on \n6. \n(i) bankable projects from worthy borrowers that have the legal mandate and financial resources to \nborrow and to repay their loans, and (ii) the quality of the SFV\u2019s president, and other management \nstaff. The latter necessitates that there will be a high-quality staffing plan that is not constrained by \nnormal  Government  staffing,  recruitment  and  remuneration  rules.  Recruitment  from  the  private \nsector was considered essential.  \n \n7. \nOf the options presented under the small-scale TA, many senior officials viewed option 4 as \na  good  starting  point.  This  option  suggests  an  SFV  ownership  and  equity  structure  involving  all \nthree  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  perhaps  ADB  and  other  IFIs,  nongovernment  financial \nintermediaries, and private sources. All equity contributors would be represented on the board of \ndirectors, and other members with strong professional expertise and FI experience could also be \nconsidered. Some officials stressed in particular the need at the very outset for participation from \nthe  private  sector  and  existing  financial  institutions  in  the  forms  of  board  membership,  a  small \nequity  contribution,  and  technical  assistance  with  preparing  projects,  structuring  deals  and \nmonitoring funded projects.  \n \n8. \nMany  officials  also  suggested  a  phased  approach,  with  the  Karachi  SFV  moving  from  an \noption 4 model towards an option 1 model (i.e., a for-profit intermediary that is largely independent \nfrom  government).  It  was  generally  felt  that  this  transition  should  be  much  more  rapid  than  has \nbeen  the  case  for  India\u2019s  Tamil  Nadu  Urban  Development  Fund.  Replication  of  the  SFV  or \nextension  of  its  mandate  to  other  Pakistan  provinces  and  the  country  as  a  whole  was  also \nconsidered  feasible,  depending  upon  its  performance  in  Karachi  and  Sindh.  In  the  final  analysis \nhowever, it was recognized that major decisions on the features and design of the SFV should be \nmade as part of a feasibility and design study. \n \n9. \nIn  the  following  terms  of  reference,  the  first  five  tasks  will  complete  the  analysis  begun \nunder  the  small-scale  TA,  while  the  remaining  tasks  will  complete  the  full  financial  feasibility  and \nmarket acceptance analysis as well as the design of the SFV.  \n \nB. \n \n\nTerms of Reference Tasks in Two Phases \n\n1.  Phase One: Identification and Preparation of Preliminary Design \n\n \n10. \npreliminary design of the SFV. More specifically, Phase One will undertake the following tasks:  \n\nPhase One will be dedicated to completion of feasibility and identification and preparation of \n\n \n\n(i)  Complete  and  update  the  analysis  of  the  economic,  financial  market,  and  related \nconditions  and  trends  important  to  the  feasibility  of  the  SFV  that  has  begun  in  the \nsmall-scale  TA  report.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  coordination  with  and \ncomplementary aspects of ADB\u2019s Private Participation in Infrastructure Development \n(PPID) Sector Development Program. \n\n \n(ii)  Conduct  detailed  analysis  of  the  potential  market  for  the  loan  financing,  technical \nassistance,  due  diligence,  loan  syndication,  monitoring,  and  financing  coordination \nservices to be provided by the SFV. This should emphasize the quality of the likely \nborrowers and projects (to provide input as well to related work under the TA loan \non organizational development and capacity building).    \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n 49 \n\n(iii)  Starting from the options and other analysis in the small-scale TA report (including \nthe findings from the Fact-Finding Mission) and the growing literature on specialized \nFIs for urban infrastructure, (a) conduct more detailed analysis of the strengths and \nweaknesses  of  such  vehicles;  (b)  assess  each  design  feature  in  detail  with \nreference to the Karachi conditions, national and international best practices, trends \nand  requirements  identified  in  task  (i),  and  (c)  using  various  indicators  and  criteria \ndescribed in this document and the literature on specialized FIs, identify the design \nfeatures  that  are  most  important  to  structuring  a  potential  SFV  for  Karachi  and  for \nperformance  of  the  Megacity  Sustainable  Development  Project  (being  prepared  in \ndetail at the same time by other members of the consulting team under the PPTA for \nMegacity Sustainable Development Project)2.  \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n As part of (iii) above, specifically assess options for the following design features: \n(a) whether the SFV should be a for-profit or nonprofit unit; (b) how best to catalyze \nnongovernment/non-IFI  financial  resources;  (c)  measures  to  tap  the  technical \nexpertise  of  commercial  FIs  and  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure  and  forms  of \nproject  financing  now  being  developed  in  Pakistan  and  elsewhere,  including \npossible strategic alliances, partnerships, and/or equity stakes in the SFV with one \nor  more  commercial  FIs;  (d)  ownership  structures  that  include  potential  public  and \nnongovernment  shareholders  for  the  SFV;  (e)  key  factors  for  the  potential  SFV  to \nwork  proactively  with  project  sponsors \nin  preparing  bankable  projects;  (f) \nmanagement  structure,  staffing,  human  resource  planning,  and  operating  structure \nrequirements; (g) potential long-term business strategy; (h) potential geographic and \nsectoral  scope,  as  well  as  the  financial  resources  and  markets  to  be  accessed  by \nthe  SFV  (including  private  financing  using  the  PPID  financing  instruments);  (i) \npotential product options, including loans, equity investments, credit enhancements, \nconduit  products  (e.g.,  concessional  loans,  subsidies  from  government  programs, \nfree  or  low-cost  land  from  local  governments)  that  might  be  targeted  at  poor \nneighborhoods  and  katchi  abadis,3and  (j)  contractual,  monitoring  and  reporting \nrelationships  needed  to  be  set  between  a  potential  independent  SFV  and \ngovernment.  \n\nIn the context of assisting potential projects to \u201cbankability,\u201d prepare a framework of \nissues  needing  to  be  addressed  with  government.  These  would  include  required \nreforms  to  tariffs  and  regulatory  structures  and  other  issues  that  a  potential  SFV \nmight need to address with government in order to assuage concerns of investors.  \n\n \n(vi)  Based on tasks (i)\u2013(v), prepare a suggested preliminary design for an SFV that will \nbe  best  suited  for  the  needs  of  Karachi\u2019s  infrastructure  development,  describing  in \ndetail  the  design  features,  rationale  for  design,  potential  impacts,  potential \nweaknesses and remedies. \n\n \n(vii)  Based on the preliminary design prepared in task (vi), select a partner (and a team \nof professionals from that partner) appropriate for that design to work with producing \na high-quality, professional, practical and detailed feasibility report for the proposed \nSFV. Depending upon preliminary design, the choice of partner might be a bank or \nfinancial  institution  (for  a  design  similar  to  option  2),  a  development  corporation \n(preliminary  design  close  to  option  3),  or  a  government  agency  for  an  urban \ndevelopment fund (preliminary design close to option 4).  \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Mega City Sustainable Development Project. \n\n3  For  example,  the  Tamil  Nadu  Urban  Development  Fund  in  India  operates  a  grant  fund  that  helps  to  address  the \n\nManila.  \n\nproblems of the urban poor. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n(viii)  As part of the detailed design work (involving the partner) for the potential SFV, also \ninclude  detailed  feasibility  studies  for  selected  high-priority  projects.  These  should \nthen be ready-to-implement projects in case the SFV is approved and commences \nlending operations. \n\nIn  selecting  the  detailed  design  team  from  the  partner,  ensure    significant  local \nexpertise in financial intermediaries, infrastructure and project financing and related \nareas  so  that  the  detailed  SFV  design  benefits  as  much  as  possible  from  these \nexpertise. \n\n \n(ix) \n\n  \n\n2.  Phase  Two:  Completion  of  Detailed  Design  and  Documentation  Needed  to \n\nPhase  Two  will  focus  on  completing  the  detailed  design  and  documentation  needed  to \n\nEstablish SFV  \n\n \n11. \nestablish the SFV. \n \n\n(i) \n\nBased  on  the  suggested  preliminary  design,  complete  the  analysis  of  the  urban \ninfrastructure  market\u2019s  demand \ntechnical  assistance, \nmonitoring,  financial  intermediation,  financing  coordination,  syndication  and  other \nservices  that  would  be  provided  by  the  SFV.  Demand  analysis  should  include  a \nyearly breakdown of the loans and other transactions expected to be made over a \n10-year period (divided by infrastructure sector, major borrowers and other criteria). \n\nfor  commercial \n\nloans, \n\nDevelop a marketing plan to target the market demand, to make potential borrowers \nand project entities aware of the technical and financial services available from the \nSFV,  and  to  build  awareness  of  the  need  for  commercial  operating  principles  in \nurban infrastructure utilities in order to ensure sustainable access to financing. \n\nProject  the  initial  capital  injection  needed  to  establish  the  SFV\u2019s  start-up  capital \nstructure (the amount and source likely will depend upon the preliminary design that \nis  selected)4  as  well  as  the  financial  resources  to  be  made  available  to  the  SFV \nthrough time (perhaps over the first 10 years) from governments (e.g., seed money \nto  support  start-up),  ADB  (through  loan  money,  perhaps  equity  from  its  Private \nSector  Operations  Department,  and  perhaps  its  partial  guarantee  facility),  other \ninternational  financial  institutions,  and  from  domestic  and  international  capital \nmarkets (including both loans and equity, if appropriate). \n\nIdentify, analyze and place monetary values on the remuneration costs (wages plus \nbenefits) of the professional, technical, support, and other staff requirements for the \nSFV and the other administration costs that will be incurred. Evaluate to the extent \npossible  what  will  be  the  availability  of  the  needed  personnel  when  the  SFV  is \nestablished. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n  \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nEstimate  the  interest  rates,  on-lending  fees,  technical  assistance5  and  other  fees \nthat  need  to  be  charged  to  make  the  SFV  self-sustaining  and  (if  appropriate) \n\n                                                 \n4  It  is  assumed  at  this  time  that  the  initial  equity  could  be  domestic.  Consultations  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission \nindicated that equity contributions could be made by the three levels of government, from one or more existing FIs and \nfrom  other  nongovernment,  private  sector  sources.  However,  depending  on  the  final  design,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations  Department  or  the  International  Finance  Corporation  of  the  World  Bank  could  provide  a  portion  of  the \nstart-up equity, particularly if the SFV\u2019s mandate  places major  emphasis  on  attracting  private investment and public-\nprivate investment. \n\n5  Technical  assistance  fees  for  project  preparation  could  be  earned  through,  for  example,  including  these  costs  in  the \n\nbudgets for high-priority projects and recovering these costs from ADB loan proceeds. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n 51 \n\nprofitable  to  its  shareholders.  Ensure  that  the  market  and  potential  borrowers  can \naccommodate  (i.e.,  are  prepared  to  pay)  those  fees  and  interest  rates,  making \nadjustments in payrolls and other costs, as may be necessary, to achieve such fees \nand rates. Prepare a spreadsheet-based financial model for the SFV incorporating \nthe aforementioned projected revenues and costs. Prepare sensitivity scenarios for \nthe financial model based on realistic scenarios. \n\nIdentify  the  key  risks  and  uncertainties  (including  foreign  exchange,  credit \n[nonperforming loans] and political, event risks) that could threaten the sustainability \nand profitability of the SFV, and develop strategies for addressing them. Assess the \npotential for a phased strategy for implementing the SFV business plan (described \nbelow),  whereby  less  complex  and  risky  services  and  products  might  be  launched \nearlier  and  more  complicated  and  risky  services,  products,  and  functions  could  be \nprovided over time as the SFV built a credible track record, demonstrated growing \ncompetence, as well as greater visibility and acceptance in the market. \n\nPrepare and finalize the business case (rationale, concept, approach, major benefits \nand beneficiaries), business plan, and long-term strategy for the SFV. The business \ncase should outline the vision, mission, purpose, and overall rationale for the SFV, \nas well as its ownership, legal and taxation status, and its managerial structure. This \ntask should undertake a review of the SFV\u2019s proposed role and responsibilities from \nthe  perspective  of  city  government  functions  (a)  to  ensure  a  clear  segregation  of \nduties, (b) to reduce the likelihood of overlap, and (c) to ensure that accountability of \nlocal  government  officials  to  deliver  services  is  not  obviated.  The  business  plan \nshould  include  a  full  set  of  financial  projections  (income  statement,  cash  flow,  and \nbalance sheet).     \n\n \n(viii)  The business plan and long-term strategy should also include suggested phasing of \nSFV  functions.  For  example:  (a)  establishing  SFV  capabilities,  experience  and \nmarket  credibility  through  on-lending  of  ADB  and  other  IFI  funds  to  urban \ninfrastructure projects, leading to (b)  provision of other financial products and other \nforms  of  debt  and  (eventually)  equity  financing,  (c)  tapping  the  national  and \ninternational  capital  markets,  (d)  conducting  innovative  transactions  such  as \npublic-private  partnerships,  100%  private  sector  infrastructure  projects,  funding \nstate-owned  enterprises  operating  on  commercial  principles  or  moving  toward \nlistings on the capital markets, and acquisition financing. \n\n \n(vi) \n\n   \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\nPrepare  the  human  resource  development  and  capacity  building  strategy  for  the \nSFV,  including  the  professional,  technical,  and  support  skills  needed.  It  should \ninclude  also  recruitment  policies  and  strategies,  in-house  and  institutional  training, \nand  other  human  resource  measures.  This  should  cover  the  capacity  building \nneeded to make the SFV a success, and wage and other compensation packages \nneeded to recruit and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel at all levels of \nthe  organization.  Capacity  building  in  human  resource  development  will  need  to \ninclude building understanding of (a) the requirements and procedures of ADB and \nother  IFIs  (financial,  social,  poverty,  environmental,  etc.);  (b)  the  special  financing \nrequirements  of  urban  infrastructure  projects;  (c)  the  factors  required  to  assist  in \npreparing infrastructure projects to bankable standards; (d) marketing skills to make \nSFV  products  and  services  attractive  to  local  governments,  utilities,  and  potential \nborrowers  on  commercial  lending  terms;  and  (e)  post-transaction  monitoring  and \nevaluation requirements.  \n\nPrepare  a  detailed  operations  manual  for  SFV  management  and  staff\u2014as  well  as \nfor  its  shareholders,  directors  and  others\u2014designed  to  guide  the  practices  and \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nprocedures  of  the  SFV  during  its  initial  period  of  one  to  two  years.  The  manual \nshould outline  \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\nfunds, \n\ninvestment \n\nthe vision, mission, and purpose of the SFV;  \nwhat the SFV does: the financial products and services it provides, its \ninitial  and  near-future  sources  of \nfinancing \noperations,  its  services  (in  arranging  financing,  providing  technical \nassistance,  and  training)  to  clients,  eligible  recipients  and  sectors, \neligible uses of funds, and so on;  \nhow the SFV operates (including marketing, project identification and \nprescreening,  project  appraisal,  credit  assessment  methods, \npost-transaction monitoring and evaluation, other lending policies and \nprocedures, public awareness, and project procurement. if relevant);  \nhow the SFV prices its financial products and services;  \nhow it is managed and decisions are made; and  \nhow \nthe  social,  poverty,  environmental, \neconomic, and other objectives that are important to ADB and other \nIFIs  and  bilateral  donors,  as  well  as  being  increasingly  important  to \ndomestic  and  international  investors  that  could  provide  debt  and \nequity financing to the SFV in the future. \n\nthe  SFV  addresses \n\n \n(xi) \n\nPrepare  with  counterpart  staff  from  both  parties  the  draft  memorandum  of \nunderstanding between the SFV and the government agency identified for oversight \nof  the  proposed  SFV.  This  should  include  (a)  the  roles,  responsibilities  and \nobligations of each party; and (b) the SFV\u2019s objectives and functions (the operations \nmanual  could  be  an  annex  to  the  memorandum  of  understanding)  and  the  criteria \nand  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  objectives  achievement  (including  e.g., \nfeedback from clients, investors and the general public).  \n\n \n(xii)   Establish  with  counterpart  staff  from  both  parties  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework for measuring the SFV\u2019s progress towards achieving its objectives, and \nthe  reporting  systems  and  relationships  between  the  two  parties.  Describe  as  well \nthe  roles,  responsibilities, \nfunctions,  and  reporting  requirements  of  existing \nregulators  in  the  areas  of  (e.g.,  banking,  securities,  company,  competition  and \nconsumer  protection  law  (their  relevance  and  weights  would  depend  on  the \npreferred  design)  and  ensure  that  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework \nestablished  for  SFV  will  be  consistent  with  and  supportive  of  the  statutory \nrequirements under existing regulatory regimes.     \n\nC.

A \nteam of consultants comprising three international advisors in (i) urban governance and \ncapacity building, (ii) urban finance, and (iii) urban planning and engineering, to be \nsupported by long-term local consultants, will closely work with a PSU in the \nDepartment of Finance and an LSU in the CDGK to ensure the effective management \nof the Project. This department will need assistance in the overall management of such \nTA loan activities as preparing TORs and RFPs, evaluating proposals, and managing \nTA contracts. In addition, there is a need for specific small technical assistance \nactivities to support the CDGK in carrying out planning and development tasks already \nfunded through annual development plans or Tameer-e-Karachi activities, or proposed \nfor funding under committed CDGK, provincial or federal government funding.  \nThe tasks of the advisor on urban governance and capacity building and his/her local \nconsultant counterparts will include but not be limited to (i) review, revise, and adjust as \nnecessary the proposed scope of the capacity building program; (ii) provide an updated \ncapacity building program and describe the prioritization and overall programming of the \ncapacity building activities; (iii) revise as necessary and provide detailed TORs for each \nsubprogram; (iv) assist in preparing RFPs and engaging consultants for individual \nsubprograms; (v) assist in reviewing and evaluating the reports and proposals of \nsubproject consultants; and (vi) identify the actions required to be taken by the \nGovernment to implement the city governance reform proposals (organizational \ndevelopment reforms, etc.) under the capacity building program and liaise with the PSU \nand LSU to ensure that the required actions are taken.  \n \nThe tasks of the advisor on infrastructure planning and engineering and his/her local \nconsultant counterparts will include but not be limited to (i) review, revise and adjust the \nlist of proposed projects included under the project preparation facility;  (ii) provide \nwhere necessary an updated and well justified pipeline of projects; (iii) undertake an \noverall programming of the feasibility studies for infrastructure investments; (iv) review \nthe existing TORs and make adjustments to them as necessary, then finalize those \nTORs selected for investment; (v) where necessary, prepare new project profiles and \nTORs in accordance with the reprioritization of the subprojects; (vi) coordinate with the \ncapacity building advisor for necessary synchronization of individual capacity building \nprograms and investment project preparation; (vii) assist in engaging consultants for \nsubprojects; and (viii) assist in reviewing and evaluating the subproject consultant \noutputs/reports.  \n \nThe tasks of the advisor on urban finance will include but not be limited to (i) reviewing, \nupdating, and programming of capacity building activities and programs on  financial \nmanagement, revenue mobilization, and commercialization of the Karachi  Water and \nSewerage Board and CDGK; (ii) adjusting where necessary the capacity building \nactivities related to the above; (iii) identifying reform actions that need to be undertaken \nby the province or CDGK to implement the financial management, revenue mobilization \nand commercialization improvements and prepare and finalize a reform agenda to \nimplement reforms; (iv) liaise with the PSU and LSU to implement the reforms and \nprepare an agenda for the project steering committee to bring the reform issues to the \nattention of high-level decision makers. In addition, the advisor and his/her counterparts \nwill coordinate with specialized financing vehicle consultants and provide assistance to \nthe PSU in executing and implementing the financing vehicle component.
