(BEGC), \ncomprising  (i)  an  A-loan  of  up  to  $120  million  equivalent  in  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii) a \ncomplementary  loan  of  up  to  $120  million  equivalent  in  dollars  and  yuan  for  the  Wastewater \nTreatment  and  Reuse  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  This  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Climate Change Fund1, and \nthe  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund2 under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n\n2. \nWith  rapid  urbanization,  the  PRC  has  been  encountering  water  challenges.  More  than \n400 cities report water shortages, with an average daily shortfall of 16 million cubic meters. Per \ncapita  freshwater  resources  in  the  PRC  are  scarce  at  about  2,200  cubic  meters  versus  the \nglobal  average  of  9,200  cubic  meters.  Annual  per  capita  water  endowments  have  been \ndeclining  at  an  alarming  rate,  and  are  expected  to  decline  by  an  additional  10%  by  2025. \nExtensive  water  pollution  further  reduces  availability  of  freshwater.  In  2012,  31%  of  10  major \nriver  systems  and  39%  of  62  primary  lakes  could  not  fulfill  the  water  quality  requirement  for \ndrinking  water.  The  quality  of  as  much  as  57%  of  the  total  national  groundwater  is  classified \n\u201cbad\u201d  or  \u201cvery  bad.\u201d3 Public  health  consequences  are  significantly  affecting  lives,  livelihoods, \nand productivity.  \n \n3. \nIn  response,  integrated  water  management  has  been  a  focus  area  of  business \ndevelopment  efforts  of the  Asian  Development Bank  (ADB). The  successful  implementation of \nthe ADB TA by ADB\u2019s East Asia Department highlighted strategic wastewater management and \nreuse.4   Wastewater,  if  properly  treated,  can  effectively  reduce  pollution  and  become  a  new \nreliable  source  to  address  water  scarcity.  With  adequate  technologies,  wastewater  can  be \ntreated to meet specific needs and purposes, such as industry use, including machine cooling, \ncleansing,  and  boiler  operation.  More  freshwater  can  be  allocated  for  uses that  require  higher \nquality,  such  as for drinking,  thereby  contributing to more  sustainable resource  allocation.  It  is \nalso  a  more  efficient  option  to  address  water  needs  in  areas  with growing water  consumption, \nboth on a per capita and total basis, without adding new infrastructure for a freshwater treatment \nfacility.  \n \n4. \nThrough  the  continuous  wastewater  reuse  project  screening  and  discussion  with \nstakeholders, the project team identified that BEWG, an integrated water infrastructure operator, \n\n                                                \n1   Established by ADB.   \n2   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland.   \n3   Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  2013.

Manila (TA7083-PRC). \n\n\f2 \n\nas  having  an  innovative  business  model  that  could  embody  this  new  direction.  BEWG \nacknowledged ADB\u2019s recent international syndication for the PRC Municipal Water Distribution \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,5 and  requested  ADB  to  take  the  lead  in  arranging  a  dual-\ncurrency financing package, relying on ADB structuring skills.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nThe  project  is  designed  as  the  least-cost  solution  to  facilitate  reuse  of  treated \nwastewater by upgrading multiple wastewater treatment plants to meet grade 1A standard. The \ntreated  wastewater  can  then  be  reused  for  industry  cooling  and  urban  environment  purposes. \nThe  project  involves  the  acquisition,  upgrade  and/or  expansion,  and  operation  of  wastewater \ntreatment  plants  with  technology  options  for  meeting  reuse  water  quality  for  up  to  1.8  million \ntons  per  day  during  2014\u20132016.  In  municipalities  that  do  not  yet  have  appropriate  associated \ninfrastructure  for  wastewater  reuse,  BEWG  will  first  upgrade  wastewater  treatment  facilities  to \nmeet the water quality standards for reuse before any actual sales of the treated wastewater.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsor  \n\nThe  project  will  have  two  borrowers:  BEWG  for  the  dollars  and  off-shore  yuan  tranche \n\n6. \nand BEGC, a PRC holding company wholly owned by BEWG, for the on-shore yuan tranche.  \n \n7. \nBEWG,  the  sponsor  and  the  primary  borrower,  is  a  holding  company  incorporated  in \nBermuda  and  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange.  At  the  end  2012,  44.1%  of  BEWG \nshares  were  held  by  Beijing  Enterprises  Holdings  Limited,  which  is  in  turn  majority  owned  by \nBeijing  Enterprises Group Company  Limited.  BEWG differentiates  itself from  its  peers through \nits  strong  focus  on  comprehensive  solutions  to  integrated  water  management  with  advanced \ntechnology, wastewater treatment in particular. As of 2012, BEWG owned concessions in about \n90  cities  and  counties  in  19  provinces.  It  operated  83  wastewater  treatment  plants,  21  water \nsupply plants, and one seawater desalination plant with total design capacity of 7.3 million tons \nper day. ADB\u2019s review of BEWG does not give ADB cause to believe that this entity has been \nestablished,  or  is  being  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or  terrorism \nfinancing in the jurisdictions involved in the project.6 \n\n \nBEGC,  the  second  borrower,  is  incorporated  in  the  PRC  as  an  on-shore  investment \n\n8. \nplatform to own the wastewater treatment and reuse project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n9. \nWastewater  treatment,  BEWG\u2019s  core  business,  contributed  approximately  52%  of \nBEWG profit in 2012. BEWG is a pioneer in reuse of treated wastewater and has implemented \nfour  projects  with  499,500  tons  per  day  in  total  in  cities  with  low  natural  water  resources  and \nhigh  water  utilization. 7  Since  its  incorporation  in  2008,  BEWG\u2019s  operating  and  financial \nperformance  has  improved  steadily.  As  of  2012,  BEWG  reported  pre-tax  profits  of  HK$1,092 \n\n                                                \n5  ADB and 18 banks signed a $100 million B-loan on 1 February 2013 to China Water Affairs Group. \n6   Bermuda  is  on  the  \u201cwhite  list\u201d  of  OECD  jurisdictions  which  have  substantially  implemented  the  internationally \nagreed tax standard. The Global Forum is conducting a peer review process that examines the legal and regulatory \nframework of member jurisdictions (Phase 1 reviews). Bermuda has passed its Phase 1 review, and therefore has \nqualified to pass on to its Phase 2 review (which is of the actual implementation of the internationally agreed tax \nstandard). \n\n7   Beijing, Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong provinces. \n\n\f3 \n\nmillion  ($141million),  total  assets  of  HK$31.3  billion  ($4.0  billion),  and  total  net  assets  of \nHK$10.7 billion ($1.4 billion).  \n\n \n10. \nBEWG\u2019s  strategy  is  to  focus  on  acquiring  small-  to  medium-sized  plants  and  improve \ntheir  operating  performance  to  meet  the  best  water  quality  standard.  Technologies  employed \nare  the  anaerobic\u2013oxic  activated  sludge  process  or  anaerobic\u2013anoxic\u2013oxic  activated  sludge \nprocess,  with  advanced  treatment  for  reuse.8 BEWG  is  responsible  for  identifying,  evaluating, \nselecting, negotiating, implementing, and administering the project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  anticipated  project  impact  includes  (i)  enhanced  urban  environment  and  reduced \npollution,  (ii)  sustainable  source  of  water  for  industry  and  urban  environment  use,  and  (iii) \nincreased private sector investment in wastewater management.  \n \n\nThe  project  is  expected to improve the quality  of  treated  wastewater  in  the  PRC.  It  will \n\n12. \nincrease the capacity to treat effluents, and the water will be enhanced to a higher standard.  \n \n\n13. \nThe  project  output  is  the  installation  and  operation  of  wastewater  treatment  and  reuse \nplants  with  total  capacity  of  up  to  1.8  million  tons  per  day.  Other  socioeconomic  benefits, \ncaptured in the design and monitoring framework, include job creation in local communities.9  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  fully  consistent  with  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  infrastructure  and \nenvironment  as  two  of  the  five  core  focus  areas  for  ADB  operations.10 For  infrastructure,  the \nproject  is  in line  with  the  strategy\u2019s  urban infrastructure focus  on  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nwaste,  as  well  as  its  emphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnership  and  livable  cities.  For  the \nenvironment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats,  and  promotes  the \nconservation of natural resources. \n \n15. \nBy  supporting  inclusive  growth  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  project  directly \naddresses  two  of  the  three  development  goals  of  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  and \naligns  with  the  strategy\u2019s  affirmation  of  natural  resources  and  urban  development  as  priority \n\n                                                \n8   The  advanced  treatment  processes  include  biological  aeration  filter,  baffled  reactor,  inclined  tube  setting,  and \n\n9   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  ADB.  2008.

While energy is a major user of water, it also constitutes a major cost for municipal water \nservice. 15 Electricity accounts for 50% of the direct costs in wastewater treatment. To meet the \nnational  reuse  water  standards,  wastewater  treatment  processes  need  25%\u201335%  more \nelectricity. For the reuse project to succeed and for municipalities to cope with the rapid growth \nof  water  and  energy  demand,  efficient  energy  conservation  is  a  prerequisite.  Reuse  of \nwastewater  offers  a  stable  option  that  brings  substantial  benefits  to  end-users.  However, \nfreshwater\u2014ground and surface water in particular\u2014is still widely subsidized, and is thus still a \npopular option among a wide range of water users, including industry. Reuse of wastewater can \nbe  more  competitive  if  appropriate  energy  efficiency  measures  are  properly  introduced.  The \nprimary  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  enhance  the  affordability  of  reuse  and  thereby  encourage \nreplacement of freshwater in cities across the country.  \n \n22. \nThe  TA  will  have  four  components:  (i) energy  audit  of  selected  pilot  wastewater \ntreatment  and  reuse  plants,  (ii)  enhancement  of  the  energy  management  system  of  the  pilot \nplants,  (iii)  knowledge  sharing  with  a  wider  range  of  municipal  governments  on  introducing \n\n                                                \n15 Thermal power cooling uses about 90% of water withdrawal of ground- and surface-water source in the PRC. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nwastewater  reuse  with  an  energy  efficiency  option,  and  (iv)  policy  recommendations.  The \nenergy-saving  solutions  will  include  feasibility  studies  for  energy  efficiency  improvements, \nintegrated  energy  efficiency  planning  and  implementation,  and  effective  energy  policies  for \nwastewater treatment and reuse. A capacity development program and training materials will be \nprepared  for  the  training  of  senior  management  and  key  municipal  government  officers  on \nenergy efficiency, including best practices of energy efficiency in the wastewater treatment and \nreuse operation; energy efficiency project cycle covering energy audit, list of solutions, expected \nsaving,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  institutionalizing  energy  efficiency \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  Through  a  workshop  for  a  wide  range  of  municipal \ngovernments,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  setting  a  viable  business  model  which  is  expected  to \nencourage reuse of wastewater with an energy efficiency option as a new source of water.  \n \nThe TA is classified as capacity development technical assistance category B. The TA is \n23. \nestimated  to  cost  $500,000.  It  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Climate  Change  Fund \n(footnote  1)  and  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility \n(footnote 2), and administered by ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24. \nADB will act as the executing agency of the TA and will ensure that the TA will effectively \ncontribute to ADB\u2019s follow-on policy dialogue. The TA will be implemented over 24 months. ADB \nand BEWG will form a TA task force comprising appropriate ADB and  BEWG representatives, \nas  well  as  the  TA  consultants.  The  task  force  will  communicate  regularly  to  assess  needs, \nmonitor  progress,  and  discuss  issues.  A  consulting firm  will  be  selected using  the quality-  and \ncost-based selection method with simplified technical proposals. Recruitment of the firm will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n25. \n\nJustification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following: \n(i) \n\nThe project will have a significant demonstration impact as the first ADB private \nsector  intervention  to  support  wastewater  reuse  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  an \nintegrated  water  chain,  which  is  still  being  developed  in  the  PRC.  ADB \nassistance  will  build  confidence  in  future  private  sector  participation  in  this \nemerging subsector.  \nThe project will build on ADB\u2019s recent complementary public sector interventions \nin the area and will reflect a continuation of ADB efforts to set high management \nand  environmental  standards.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with \nthe  project  can \nmeaningfully contribute to the dialogue on regulations in the PRC and the region, \nand  continue  to  help  establish  effective  and  efficient  solutions  for  integrated \nwater management.  \nADB requirements will ensure that BEWG adheres to high-efficiency wastewater \ntreatments,  serving  as  a  model  for  the  industry.  The  TA  will  address  the  water \nand  energy  nexus  by  enhancing  energy  efficiency  of  wastewater  treatment  and \nreuse. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f7 \n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\n26. \nRevenue  risk.  Revenue  risk  may  arise  from  low  wastewater  supply  and  inadequate \nwastewater treatment fees. There is concern that some municipalities do not apply the minimum \ntariff  stipulated  by  the  central  government.  BEWG\u2019s  subprojects  are  under  standardized \nconcession  arrangements  that  guarantee  minimum  offtake  and  regulated  cost\u2013plus  tariffs. \nFurther  mitigating  this  risk  are  (i)  strong  policy  pressure  for  tariff  reform  to  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery;  (ii)  large  latent  demand  for  wastewater  treatment  and  BEWG\u2019s  practice  of  selecting \nsubprojects  in  part  based  on  demand  potential;  (iii)  BEWG\u2019s  adoption  of  higher  treatment \nstandard that commands better tariff; (iv)  phased construction approach to improve the  plants\u2019 \nutilization rate; and (v) the portfolio nature of ADB assistance, which diversifies the risk across a \nnumber of subprojects. \n \n27. \nOfftake  counterparty  risk.  Wastewater  treatment  fees  are  publicly  announced  and \nreliably collected from end-users through bundling with water distribution fees and backstopped \nby  municipal  governments  under  concession  agreement  obligations.  As  for  wastewater  reuse \nsubprojects,  the  offtaker  can  vary  depending  on  the  purpose  of  reuse.  BEWG  carefully \nevaluates offtaker credibility and subproject economics up front and will mitigate  offtake risk by \nincluding a guaranteed minimum sales volume from end-users in well-defined sales agreements. \nThe  project  further  benefits  from  its  portfolio  arrangements  to  diversify  offtake  risk  among \nsubprojects. \n \n28. \nRegulatory  risk. Due to the water scarcity and environmental pollution in the PRC, the \ncentral government has set clear targets regarding water supply, pollution control, and pricing to \nimprove wastewater treatment rate and standards.  No significant changes to industry regulation \nare expected.   \n \n29. \nCompletion  and  operation  risk.  In  the  PRC,  turn-key  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction  (EPC)  is  not  commonly  available  and  operation  is  typically  managed  in-house. \nBEWG  has  a  proven  technical  and  management  track  record  in  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  of  wastewater  treatment  plants.  The  risk  is  also  mitigated  by  the  homogeneous \nnature  of  the  subprojects  and  the  mature  nature  of  technology  for  wastewater  treatment  and \nreuse, as well as the low number of staff required for plant operation. \n \n30. \nAssociated  infrastructure  risk.  The  success  of  a  wastewater  treatment  or  reuse \nsubproject relies not only on the construction and operation of the plant, but also the readiness \nand  reliability  of  the  associated  infrastructure,  especially  the  pipelines  and  pump  stations. \nMunicipal  governments  usually  construct  and  own  this  infrastructure.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by \nBEWG\u2019s  subproject  screen  criteria  to  select  municipalities  with  comprehensive  planning  and \nfinancial  leeway,  and  inclusion  of  the  availability  of  the  associated  infrastructure  as  the \nmunicipality\u2019s obligation under the concession agreement. \n \n31. \nAggressive expansion plan. BEWG\u2019s plan to develop about 10 plants with a total daily \ncapacity  of  up  to  1.8  million  tons  per  day  within  3  years  requires  significant  management \nresources  and  substantial  capital  funding.  This  aggressive  expansion  plan  involves  execution \nand funding risks, which are partially mitigated by (i)  BEWG\u2019s technical competence, including \nuse  of  standardized  management  systems  across  its  subprojects;  use  of  industry  experts; \nshared technical resources at several hubs for operations; and the homogeneous nature of the \nsubprojects; and (ii) adoption of eligibility criteria for the selection of subprojects and monitoring \nof compliance with financial covenants to ensure project viability. \n \n\n\f8 \n\nStructural subordination. The ADB loan will be structurally subordinated to direct loans \n32. \nraised  by  the  project  companies  from  local  banks.  This  risk  is  partially  mitigated  by  various \nmeasures employed by other ADB projects with similar project structure.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n33. \nSafeguards.  The  project  is  being  processed  as  corporate  finance,  with  ADB  funds \nexpected  to  be  allocated  for  implementing  specific  subprojects.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (SPS, 2009) requirements for corporate finance,  the  safeguard  requirements \n1\u20133  will  apply.  In  addition  BEWG  is  to  establish  and  maintain  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to screen, assess, and address environmental and social impacts \nand  risks.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  impacts  on  the  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. The location of the wastewater treatment and reuse \nfacilities  are  selected  in  coordination  with  the  municipal  governments  and  are  generally  sited \naccording  to  the  appropriate  land  uses.  These  facilities  are  required  to  undergo  an \nenvironmental assessment process in the PRC. Involuntary resettlement impacts are expected \nto not be significant, as the plants are proposed in lands reserved for industrial uses, within or in \nthe  vicinity  of  urban  areas.  Municipal  governments  normally  complete  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation (if needed) prior to handing the area over to BEWG. Impacts on \nindigenous peoples are not anticipated as the plants are typically located in the vicinity of urban \nareas where the population is primarily Han. The potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe  project  have thus  been  identified  and  effective  measures to avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans. \nBEWG has  committed  to enhance  its  institutional  capacity to adequately  manage  the  project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts. \n \n34. \nA  corporate  audit  was  conducted  on  BEWG\u2019s  quality,  environment,  health,  and  safety \npolicy; and its past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements \nof the SPS. The audit confirms there are no existing or legacy issues relating to the two audited \nexisting plants. Gaps were identified and addressed in a corrective action plan. BEWG commits \nto  adopting  an  ESMS,  incorporating  the  corrective  action  plan,  which  is  satisfactory  to  ADB \nbefore the first ADB disbursement. Key findings of the due diligence show that the company has \nan environmental management system in place. It also has screening and review procedures to \nidentify  and  finance  subprojects.  It  has  staff  in  charge  of  environmental  and  labor  aspects  at \ncorporate headquarters and plants, and has an internal environmental monitoring and reporting \nprocedure.  BEWG  and  its  subprojects  are  ISO-certified  (9000,  14000,  and  18000)  and  have \ncomplied  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations.  The  quality,  environment,  health,  and \nsafety policy currently does not include policies and procedures to screen, assess, and address \ninvoluntary resettlement and impacts on indigenous peoples. Key corrective actions outlined in \nthe ESMS arrangement and agreed with the company are to (i) enhance the environmental and \nsocial  policy  objectives  of  the  quality,  environment,  health,  and  safety  manual  to  incorporate \nprovisions  to  comply  with  the  ADB  SPS  and  social  protection  requirements;  (ii)  adopt  an \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedure  to  consider  the  significance  of \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts;  (iii)  appoint  and  train  staff  responsible  for  safeguard \ncompliance;  (iv)  comply  with  ADB  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements;  and  \n(v)  enhance  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting  procedures.  The  company  will  apply  ADB's \nprohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by \n\n\f9 \n\napplicable national laws and regulations, and comply with the ADB SPS. To ensure compliance \nof  future  subprojects  with  the  SPS,  BEWG  will  carry  out  due  diligence  based  on  the  ESMS \nscreening  mechanism.  If  category  B  or  A  impacts  are  confirmed,  BEWG  will  prepare  the \nnecessary  safeguard  planning  documents  in  accordance  with  safeguard  requirements  1\u20133  of \nthe  SPS  for  each  subproject,  and  submit  them  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  BEWG  will \nsubmit monitoring reports on implementation of ESMS and the subprojects.16 \n \n35. \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  company  has  committed to ensure  that  local  residents \nwill comprise 90% of those engaged for jobs to be created for facility operations, and to retain \nemployees in facilities acquired through transfer of ownership.  BEWG commits to maintain the \ncurrent  ratio  of  female  staff  (30%)  and  ensure  that  the  rights  and  interests  of  women  are \nprotected.  The  company  agreed  to  prioritize  hiring  of  local  women  for  supervisory  and \nadministrative jobs created, and to engage local laborers for construction, including women. The \nproject is classified as having no gender elements.  BEWG and its contractors will comply  with \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy,17 report  regularly  to  ADB  on  compliance  with  national  labor \nstandards,  and  take  measures  to  adhere  to  relevant  core  labor  standards  consistent  with \nnational laws.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nBEWG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n36. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n37. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 18  the \n38. \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance to BEWG. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan facility \nof  up  to  $240,000,000  equivalent  to  Beijing  Enterprises  Water  Group  Limited  and  BEWG \nEnvironmental Group Company Limited for the Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, comprising \n\n                                                \n16  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Safeguards, and Social Dimensions Summary; and Findings of \nthe  Corporate  Safeguards  Audit:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2.) \n\n17  ADB. 2003.
