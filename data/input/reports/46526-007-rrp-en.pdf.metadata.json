This will be achieved by improving urban infrastructure \nand services and  enhancing  the  operation  and maintenance  (O&M)  capacity for  urban  service \ndelivery.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n3. \nCities are the economic, social, and innovative core of Pakistan. They generate most of \nthe country\u2019s wealth and are home to about 40% of the population.2 Pakistan\u2019s cities, particularly \nthe intermediate cities,3  are developing at a fast rate. This has led to rapid expansion of the urban \nenvironment  in  an  uncoordinated,  unplanned,  and  unregulated  manner.  Basic  urban  services, \nsuch as water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, storm water drainage, and the urban \nroad  networks,  are  increasingly  unable  to  respond  to  population  pressures  and  economic \ndemands. Residents are suffering from an acute shortage of open spaces and civic amenities. \nThis  has  increased  demand  to  make  Pakistan\u2019s  cities  more  livable\u2014to  promote  better  living \nstandards, improve public health, and develop the country\u2019s economy in a sustainable manner. \n  \n4. \nThe Government of Pakistan has realized the importance of making its cities more livable, \nparticularly  the  intermediate  cities,  and  has  put  the  urban  sector  at  the forefront  of  its  national \ndevelopment strategy. Pakistan\u2019s Vision 20304 and Framework for Economic Growth5 envisage \nlivable  cities  as  engines  of  national  growth  and  centers  of  economic  activity,  culture,  and \nknowledge.  The  Framework  for  Economic  Growth  also  recognizes  the  advantage  of  local \ngovernments in managing urban development, being closer to the beneficiary population, better \nsituated  to  identify  citizens\u2019  preferences,  and  having  the  flexibility  to  respond  rapidly  to  cities\u2019 \nevolving needs. The government amended its constitution in 2010 to decentralize urban services \nto the provincial governments.6  \n  \n5. \nAbout 53% of Pakistan\u2019s urban population lives in Punjab cities, and the urban areas of \nPunjab generate an estimated 50% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.7 The Government of \nPunjab has pioneered several key urban sector initiatives. In 2006, it created the Urban Unit to \nmanage  urban  sector  issues  in  Punjab  Province.  Following  the  positive  experience  in  Punjab, \n\n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  through  the  Punjab \nIntermediate Cities Improvement Investment Program (TA 8683-PAK), as well as through resources from the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia. \n\n2  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division. 2016.

Islamabad. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nother  provincial  governments  established  urban  units  using  a  similar  approach.  The  Local \nGovernment  and  Community  Development  (LG&CD)  Department  of  Punjab  is  the  line \ngovernment ministry responsible for providing municipal services at provincial level.  \n \n\n2. \n\nChallenges and Opportunities \n\n \nIn  its  Medium-Term  Development  Framework,  2013\u20132016,8 the  Government  of  Punjab \n6. \nincluded  an  urban sector  development  strategy, comprising  106  urban projects.  As  part  of the \nimplementation of this framework, the Government of Punjab requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia to undertake a comprehensive urban \nsector  assessment,9 which  identified  the  following  challenges  and  opportunities  in  making  the \ncities in Punjab more livable and sustainable. \n \n7. \nInadequate infrastructure. The urban population in Punjab, the most populous province \nin Pakistan, is growing at an unprecedented speed\u2014demographic projections show a rise from \nthe  current  32  million  to  60  million  by  2030  (footnote  8).  Despite  government  efforts,  urban \ninfrastructure development  has  not kept  pace  with the rapid  population growth.  Punjab\u2019s  cities \nprovide piped water to only 45% of their residents while more than half of the wastewater flows in \nopen drains and is discharged untreated into natural water bodies or onto agricultural lands. Poor \npublic transport and inadequate street management constrain urban mobility. Much of the cities\u2019 \ndaily economic activity takes place along narrow inner city streets competing with buses, cars, \nmotorcycles, and pedestrians.  \n \n8. \nPoor capacity and weak institutional framework. The Government of Punjab currently \nprovides key urban services at city level but these services are often unreliable and do not meet \nthe service standards customers expect. Improvement of urban services in Punjab is limited by \ninadequate staff capacity and a weak institutional framework, which offers little incentive to staff \nand no accountability to customers. Little attention has been paid to day-to-day operations and \nservice provisions.  A new institutional setup is urgently needed to restore public confidence in \nkey urban services. The project will support the Government of Punjab to establish urban services \ncompanies in the cities of Sahiwal and Sialkot. The Government of Punjab will entrust the above \nurban services companies with the responsibility of municipal services including water, sanitation, \nand  urban  spaces  management.  These  companies  will  adopt  key  corporate  governance \nrequirements. For instance, the board of directors in the companies will oversee and manage the \ncompany\u2019s  strategic  directions,  policies,  service  standards,  and  operational  performance. \nCorporate  decisions  and  operational  performance  will  be  publicly  disclosed  to  enhance \ntransparency and accountability to customers. Evidence shows that such companies in Pakistan \ndeliver  more  reliable  urban  services. 10  Upon  establishment  of  the  new  companies,  the \nGovernment of Punjab will enter into agreements11 with these companies to transfer government \n\n                                                \n8   Government  of  Punjab,  Planning  and  Development  Department.  2013.

Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA8556-REG). \n\n10 Cities of Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, among other cities, have set up new urban service companies that have taken \nover  municipal  services  from respective city  governments. The  new  companies  have  contributed  to deliver  more \nreliable and sustainable urban services in these cities.      \n\n11 The Government of Punjab, with ADB-funded consultants, prepared Services and Asset Management Agreements \nin July 2017. The Government of Punjab is currently preparing for the establishment of the new companies. These \ncompanies will be established in 2018.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nowned  urban  infrastructure  and  assets.  These  companies  will  deliver  urban  services  through \nmanaging various service contracts.   \n\nthat  are  supporting  urban \n\nChoice of cities. The Government of Punjab is closely working with various development \n9. \ninfrastructure  development,  reforms,  and  capacity \npartners \ndevelopment in the province.12 The World Bank supports five large cities in Punjab (Faisalabad, \nGujranwala,  Lahore,  Multan,  and  Rawalpindi).  In  March  2014,  the  Government  of  Punjab \nrequested ADB to finance a new urban sector project covering two intermediate cities (Sahiwal, \nand Sialkot) that are strategically important but not covered by the World Bank project.13 These \ncities have also been proposed due to their proximity to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, \nwhich provides greater economic opportunities for increased trade and regional cooperation. They \nalso represent a mix of socioeconomic growth models, ranging from well-established industrial \ncities (e.g. Sialkot) to cities that grew from rural agricultural centers to major service centers (e.g. \nSahiwal).  Sahiwal  and  Sialkot  are  also  selected  due  to  good  project  readiness  and  the  timely \ncompletion  of  the  urban  sector  assessment  (footnote  9)  that  highlights:  (i)  improvement  of \nmunicipal  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development,  as  key \npriorities for making the two cities more livable and sustainable. \n \n10. \nLessons  learned.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  urban  sector  projects  supported  by \nADB in Pakistan indicate, among others, the need to (i) link infrastructure development with robust \ninstitutional  strengthening  and reforms,  supported by  capacity  development;  (ii)  avoid  complex \nimplementation  arrangements;  (iii)  have  fewer  subprojects  and  locations  for  ease  of  project \nimplementation;  (iv)  work  with  cities  that  have  strong  political  will  to  implement  reforms;  and \n(v) establish  clear  service  standards  for  effective  outsourcing.  A  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (footnote 1) has supported the needed institutional reforms with the formation of an \nurban services company in each city. Prepaid water meters will be pilot tested as an innovative \napproach, along with activities to build awareness of the dividends of clean drinking water and \nsanitation services to improve the population\u2019s willingness to pay for the services. Nonrevenue \nwater will be reduced by upgrading or replacing infrastructure and enhancing O&M capacity to \nlocate  and  rectify  system  leakages.  Cost  recovery  tariffs  will  be  introduced  with  targeted \nsubsidies, where required, to ensure the long-term sustainability of services. \n \nADB\u2019s value addition.  In addition to the financing it provides, ADB facilitates access to \n11. \na wealth of knowledge, technologies, and international best practices. Major value additions are \nsummarized below: \n\n(i) \n\nInstitutional  reform  and  formation  of  new  urban  services  companies.  The \nGovernment  of  Punjab,  with  ADB\u2019s  support,  has  developed  two  reform  actions \nincluding:  (a)  time-bound  financing  sustainability  action  plan 14  that  entails  ten \nactions ranging from consumer surveys, tariff policy development, and awareness \ncampaign; and (b) formation of the new urban services companies that will provide \nmore  reliable  municipal  services  with  improved  corporate  governance  structure \n(para.8).  Operational  efficiency  and  sustainability  will  be  improved  with  the \nimplementation of these reform actions.  \n\n                                                \n12 Key  development  partners  implementing  urban  sector  projects  include  the  World  Bank,  the  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  The  Asian \nInfrastructure  Investment  Bank  may  open  a  new  resident  mission  in  Pakistan,  and  may  implement  urban  sector \nprojects in Punjab. \n\n13 The project is aligned with ADB. 2015. Pakistan: Country Partnership Strategy (2015\u20132019). Manila. \n14 Financial sustainability action plan will be implemented as defined in the Project Administration Manual (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nInnovations and international best practice. The project will introduce several \ninnovations  such  as  prepaid  water  metering  for  effective  commercial  user-fee \ncollection  and  an  inclusive  green  city  approach  that  combines  infrastructure \ndevelopment  with  climate  change resilience  and  disaster  risk  management.  For \ninstance, river bank improvement is designed to combine public green space with \nflood management features.  Another  example  is  street management  to  improve \nconditions for  all  competing  street  users  including  pedestrians  and  all modes of \ntransport  while  also  improving  green  urban  environment.    Bus  terminals  in  both \ncities will also adopt international best practice (para. 15).       \nPro-poor  focus.  Access  to  clean  water,  sanitation,  and  urban  public  spaces  is \nvital to all residents irrespective of socioeconomic status. Civil works to improve \nwater distribution networks, such as new boreholes and pipe connection, will target \nspecial distribution network zones which are inhabited by those vulnerable groups.  \nImprovement on parks, streets, and greenbelts will also be prioritized in the above \nnetwork  zones.  The  selected  special  distribution  network  zones  include  Azam \nBlock, Farid Town, Tariq Bin Ziad Colony, and other areas in the two cities. \nCapacity development support. Based on the robust training needs assessment \ncarried  out  by  the  project,  a  capacity  development  program  was  prepared.  The \nprogram will support: (a) a specialized program focused on technical engineering \nand operational aspects; and (b) a management program that addresses project \nmanagement, tariff policy, customer services, and other general administration.  \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: living standards, health, and economy in \n12. \nSahiwal  and  Sialkot  improved.15 The  project  will  have the following  outcome:  access to quality \nurban services by the residents of Sahiwal and Sialkot cities improved.16 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Water  supply  systems  improved.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \ninstallation and rehabilitation of 114 boreholes and tube wells (Sahiwal-19; Sialkot-95); 22 water \nreservoirs (Sahiwal-12; Sialkot-10); 20 water pumping stations (Sahiwal-8; Sialkot-12); about 350 \nkilometers (km) of water pipes (Sahiwal-54 km; Sialkot-312 km); up to 15,000 metered customer \nconnections (Sahiwal-6,400; Sialkot-8,800), 1,400 of which will be piloting prepaid meters; and \nnew supervisory control and data administration (SCADA) systems. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Sanitation systems improved. This will be achieved through the installation \nof  18  sewage  pumping  stations  (Sahiwal-10;  Sialkot-8),  replacement  of  about  41  km  of  sewer \npipes  (Sahiwal-11  km;  Sialkot-30  km),  provision  of  equipment  for  wastewater  management, \nunblocking of local drains, and construction of a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) \nin  Sahiwal.  Equipment  will  also  be  procured  for  improved  collection  and  segregation  of  solid \nwastes. \n \nOutput  3:  Urban  public  spaces  improved.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \n15. \nrehabilitation of 11 parks (Sahiwal-6; Sialkot-5), three greenbelts (Sahiwal-2; Sialkot-1), footpaths, \nriverbank paths, streets, and three bus terminals (Sahiwal-2; Sialkot-1) that are critical hubs for \n\n                                                \n15 Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Department. 2015.

A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  established  to  support  the  LG&CD \nDepartment  at  provincial  level,  and  two  city  implementation  units  (CIUs)  have  also  been \nestablished to implement the project in Sahiwal and Sialkot.  The Urban Unit will provide advisory \nsupport to the LG&CD Department on the capacity development component. Under the guidance \nof  the  project  steering  committee,  the  LG&CD  Department  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nexecution of the project. The city governments of Sahiwal and Sialkot will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  project  implementation.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  with  project \nimplementation,  audit,  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in the PAM.  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n31 December 2017\u201331 December 2023 \n31 December 2023 \n30 June 2024 \n\n8 contracts \n\nProject steering committeea \nPunjab Local Government and Community Development Department \nCity governments of Sahiwal and Sialkot (municipal corporations) \nArrangements \nProject management unit, city implementation units, and the Urban Unit \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive \nbidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \nThree  consulting  service  packages  and  the  costs  required  for  the \nestablishment of the project management unit and city implementation units \nare proposed for advance contracting and retroactive financing, equivalent \nto 20% of the loan amount.

The \nproject components and project sites were selected through consultations with stakeholders and \ncommunities, building on lessons learned (paras. 9 and 10). A geographic information system-\nbased map was prepared for each city, indicating project sites and their interconnectivity.  Each \nproject component designed for each city allows for achieving independent results, in most cases \nwithout  the  risk  of  delay  or  lack  of  completion  of  other  project  components.  For  Sahiwal,  the \nWWTP  and  drainage  systems  were  designed  in  coordination  with  the  Environment,  Natural \nResources and Agriculture Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department as the division \nis preparing a new project for water quality in irrigation systems that will be linked with the WWTP \noperations  (output  2).  A  climate  change  vulnerability  assessment  was  conducted,  which \nconfirmed  the  project\u2019s  medium  climate  risk  categorization,  and  mitigation  actions  were \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  project  adopts  good  practices  to  improve  project \nsustainability  and  impact.  For  example,  prepaid  water  metering  systems  will  be  introduced  to \nmake service delivery more equitable and sustainable. With the prepaid water metering system, \ncollection efficiencies will be improved for sustainable services.  \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe economic analysis of the project was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor  the  economic  analysis  of  projects.18 A  project  is  considered  feasible  when  the  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) equals or exceeds the social discount rate of 9.0%. The analysis \nshows  that  the  project  components  will  have  major  quantifiable  and  nonquantifiable  benefits, \nincluding  (i)  incremental  water  consumption  and  time  savings  from  water  collection  (output  1), \n(ii) health  benefits  from  improved  sanitation  (outputs  1  and  2),  (iii)  travel  time  savings  and \nreduction of traffic accidents as a result of reduced congestion and more efficient bus terminal \noperations (output 3), (iv) reduction of flood risks owing to riverbank path improvement (output 3), \nand  (v)  an  average rental  price  increase  near  greenbelts  and  parks  (output  3).  The  estimated \nEIRR is 11.7% for Sahiwal and 21.6% for Sialkot, which is higher than the economic opportunity \ncost of capital estimated at 9.0%. The overall project has an EIRR of 17.1%. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nThe cities of Sahiwal and Sialkot have not introduced comprehensive cost recovery tariffs \nfor key municipal services. The fiscal capacity of both cities to finance the operating costs of the \nproject was assessed. The urban sector assessment indicates that the two cities require about \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila; and ADB. 2017. Guidelines for \n\nthe Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\n$6 million in incremental annual operating costs, which will be provided as revenue grants through \nbudgetary  transfers  from  the  provincial  government. While  the  financial  sustainability  of  urban \nservices may still depend on budgetary transfers, the above transfers are expected to reduce over \ntime with the following measures. First, the two cities will introduce new tariff structures to improve \nfinancial  and  operational  sustainability.  Consultation  with  communities  confirmed  people\u2019s \nwillingness to support and pay for improved services, and the viability of introducing a new tariff \nscheme. Second, the revenue innovation, through the installation of about 15,000 water meters \n(of which 1,400 are prepaid water meters) in the two cities as well as the introduction of volumetric \ntariffs, is expected to result in a reduction of about 10% in nonrevenue water.  Prepaid meters will \nalso improve the collection of fees for water use. Third, investment in a bus terminal will increase \nthe revenue from fees levied on buses, and a portion of the increased revenue in bus terminal \noperation  will  be  transferred  to  the  newly  established  urban  services  companies.  These \ncompanies will also provide maintenance and clearing services to the bus terminals, which will \ngenerate revenue for the companies. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  pre-mitigation  financial  management  and  procurement  risks  are  assessed  to  be \nsubstantial for the executing and implementing agencies. In financial management, the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  follow  a  single-entry  accounting  system;  an  adequate  asset \nmanagement system and effective internal audit mechanism are not in place. Mitigation measures \nproposed  include  the  appointment  of  key  financial  management  personnel,  development  of  a \nfinancial  policies  and  procedures  manual,  and  outsourcing  of  the  internal  audit  function  in  the \nPMU  and  CIUs.  Regarding  procurement,  the  executing  agency  needs  to  appoint  a  suitable \nprocurement staff to ensure all procurement decisions follow ADB\u2019s operating principles, including \neconomy  and  efficiency,  fairness,  and  transparency.  The  executing  agency  will  follow  these \nprocurement principles embodied in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time). ADB will also provide training on ADB procurement and disbursement procedures. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith LG&CD Department, the Planning and Development Department, and the Urban Unit. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe project will benefit about 1.4 million people in Sahiwal and Sialkot cities, of which an \nestimated  29.5%  are  poor.  It  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  two  cities  through \n(i) improved water supply and sanitation services, which will reduce the incidence of waterborne \ndiseases  and  thus  household  health  expenses;  (ii)  upgraded  urban  transport  infrastructure \nincluding well-lit pedestrian walkways, and space for small vendors which will largely benefit the \npoor and low-income groups; (iii) increased functionality of public spaces and bus terminals, which \nwill provide economic opportunities for small vendors and increase the use of outdoor spaces for \nhealthy  activities;  (iv)  increased  public  awareness  of  hygiene  and  waterborne  diseases;  and \n(v) additional employment opportunities for the local labor force.  \n \n28. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, with significant direct benefits \nfor  women,  including  (i)  the  development  of  gender-inclusive  urban  infrastructure  such  as  bus \nterminals with separate female toilets and the allocation of more commercial spaces for female \nvendors, well-lit pedestrian walkways, and women\u2019s facilities in the parks; and (ii) improvement of \ngender-inclusive urban service delivery through the recruitment of more female staff in customer \nservice units and policy divisions of the urban services companies. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Impacts  from  the  project  are  mostly  related  to  the \nconstruction and rehabilitation of the trunk mains, distribution centers, and distribution networks; \nand are  expected to be short-term  and  limited. These  include dust,  noise,  vibration,  labor  and \npublic safety issues, temporary blockage of household access, traffic disturbance, production and \ntransportation  of  construction  materials,  and  disposal  of  hazardous  construction  waste. \nEnvironmental impacts during the operation phase may include lowering of the groundwater table, \ndisposal  of  WWTP  sludge,  accidental  leakage  from  chlorination,  noise  from  the  WWTP  and \npumping  stations,  and  increase  in  wastewater  production.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  all \nconstruction and operational impacts have been included in the environmental management plans \nprepared as part of the initial environmental examinations. The initial environmental examinations \nwere disclosed on the ADB website on 7 April 2017. The PMU in the LG&CD Department will be \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism to handle safeguard issues will be established after project effectiveness. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). For output 1, the due diligence report shows that \nlimited involuntary resettlement impacts are expected since project imprints are largely within the \nright-of-way. Impacts will be reassessed based on detailed designs and additional land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  will  be  prepared  as  needed.  For  output  2,  a  LARP  has  been \nprepared and disclosed19 for Sahiwal WWTP and its conveyance system. Land acquisition for the \nWWTP and conveyance system will affect about 23 landowners who will lose about 5.6 hectares \nof  arable  land,  about  50  mobile  vendors,  and  143  displaced  persons  operating  commercial \nstructures. Additional assessments may be required for some components under this subproject \nbased on detailed designs. For output 3, the due diligence report shows that limited involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  expected  for  parks  and  greenbelts,  but  impacts  will  be  reassessed \nbased on detailed designs and LARPs will be developed as needed. Output 4 has no involuntary \nresettlement impacts. All draft LARPs will be updated based on detailed designs, approved by \nADB, and disclosed before implementation. A land acquisition and resettlement framework has \nbeen  additionally  prepared  and  disclosed20 to  guide  the  planning  and  implementation  of  social \nsafeguards,  as  additional  assessment  may  be  required.  Institutional  capacity  building  will  be \nprovided  to  support  the  Punjab  PMU  and  two  CIUs  in  safeguards  implementation  through  the \nproject management consultant. A notice to proceed will not be given to contractors until LARPs \nhave been implemented for each subproject. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  communities  of  indigenous  peoples  are  in  the \nproject area, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for operational purposes. \nAccordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF. \n \n33. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n19 The  LARP  for  Sahiwal  Centralized  Sewerage  Treatment  Plant  with  Trunk  Mains  and  Conveyance  System  was \n\ndisclosed on the ADB website on 18 April 2017. \n\n20 The project land acquisition resettlement framework was disclosed on ADB website on 18 April 2017. \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nInfrastructure needs may change \nover years due to change of political \nleaderships. \nCapacity development and \ninstitutional strengthening do not \ntake place at the desired pace. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nADB will continue dialogue with relevant stakeholders throughout project \nimplementation to ensure commitment and support by any political leadership. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProcurement capacity in the \nexecuting agency is considered low. \n\nADB will closely monitor progress. Significant recourse allocations will support \nthe new companies to strengthen institutional frameworks and governance \nstructures, develop staff capacity, and improve operational efficiency and \nsustainability. \nAll procurement will follow the principles of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Project management unit and \nconsultants will support the executing agency. \nThe government will implement the time-bound financial sustainability action \nplan. The project will also support public awareness campaigns and policy \ndialogue for gradual volumetric tariff increases. These activities will highlight \nthat improved urban services need to be linked with cost recovery measures.  \nProject implementation will follow a realistic schedule.
