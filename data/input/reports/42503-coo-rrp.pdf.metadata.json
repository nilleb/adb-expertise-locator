The \nbudget  support  through  the  ERSP  will  give  a  short-term  boost  to \neconomic  activity  in  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis.  It  will  be \ncomplemented  by  structural  and  governance  measures  that  will  aid  in \neconomic recovery, and by measures that will help protect the vulnerable \nand safeguard the fiscal position of the Cook Islands.  \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsectors): Multisector (public sector management; transport, \nand information and communication technology; heath and social \nprotection; energy; water supply and other municipal infrastructure and \nservices) \n\nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting economic efficiency \nand enabling business environment, widening access to markets and \neconomic opportunities); governance (economic and financial \ngovernance) \n\nClimate change: Climate change adaptation  \nLocation impact: National \n \nCategory  C.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  has  been \nidentified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n \nThe  global  economic  crisis  led  to  a  contraction  in  the  Cook  Islands \neconomy in 2008, mainly because of a drop in tourism attributable to the \nslowdown in key source economies. One-off events in the second half of \n2009  should  prevent  a  further  fall  in  visitor  arrivals  during  the  year,  but \nunderlying  conditions  are  weak.  Without  a \nthe \nGovernment,  further  economic  contraction,  or  at  best  low  growth,  is \nexpected until the global economy recovers and tourism demand revives. \n \nThe slowdown in growth is affecting government revenue: tax collections \nfell  by  8.2%  in  real  terms  in  FY2009,  and  the  ratio  of  tax  collections  to \ngross  domestic  product  declined  from  28.3%  to  25.7%.  The  weak \nrevenue  performance  is  putting  pressure  on  government  expenditure \nprograms. The vulnerable, and particularly women with lower-paid jobs in \nthe tourism industry, are at increasing risk. \n  \nThe  economic  downturn \nin  economic \nis  worsening \nperformance since 2004, a result in part of low infrastructure investment \nand  the  end  of  the  growth  dividend  from  economic  reforms  in  the \nmid-1990s. \n \n\nthe  decline \n\nresponse \n\nfrom \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\nfor  priority \n\nfinancing  needs \n\nfinancing  will  help  meet \n\nSubprogram  1  will  provide  budget  support  to  help  the  Government \nstimulate  the  economy  and  respond  to  the  economic  downturn.  Loan \nfinancing  will  enable  higher  capital expenditure  to  reduce  the  backlog of \npriority  infrastructure  and  other  building  investment.  The  increased \nconstruction  activity  will  lift  aggregate  demand  and  economic  activity. \nGovernment will implement stronger infrastructure investment processes \nand  infrastructure  governance  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  increased \ncapital  expenditure.  Targeted  actions  will  support \nthe  vulnerable \nmembers  of  the  community.  Fiscal  safeguards  will  be  reinforced  to \npreserve fiscal sustainability. \n \nSubprogram  2  will  support  the  transition  to  higher,  more-inclusive,  and \nthe \nsustainable  economic  growth.  Loan \nGovernment\u2019s  overall \ninfrastructure. \nConcerted action to raise the standard of governance in the infrastructure \nsector  will  be  supported.  Efforts  will  center  on  implementing  an \ninfrastructure  master  plan  and  an  infrastructure  governance  framework \n(both developed with support from the Asian Development Bank [ADB]). \nInfrastructure  will  be  rebuilt  amid  constant  efforts  to  preserve  prudent \nfiscal  management  and  sustain  the  expansion  in  capital  expenditure, \nwhile paying special attention to the needs of the vulnerable members of \nthe community.  \n \nThe  ERSP  will  achieve  higher  and  more  inclusive  economic  growth \n(program  impact),  and  will  initiate  economic  recovery  with  protection  of \nthe vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal position (outcome).  \n \nThe design of the ERSP incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in \nprogram  lending  in  the  Pacific  and  elsewhere.  To  maximize  country \nownership, \nthe  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132010 and is designed to assist the Government \nin  carrying  out  its  budget  strategy  for  FY2010.  The  ERSP  is  fortified  by \nsolid diagnostics, communication and awareness-raising initiatives, and a \ncommitment to a longer-term engagement through a flexible and feasible \napproach. \n \nSupport  for  the  vulnerable  is  a  feature  of  the  program,  in  recognition  of \nthe  extra  hardship  imposed  by  the  global  economic  crisis  and  the \npreceding period of high international commodity prices. The real value of \nsocial  welfare  payments  to  the  vulnerable  will  be  preserved,  and \ngovernment  programs  will  be  explicitly  reoriented  toward  the  vulnerable. \nThe ERSP will also link with other activities in support of the vulnerable. \n \nThe Cook Islands is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or \nthe  World  Bank  Group,  and  therefore  has  limited  access  to  financial \nsupport \nthe  global  economic  crisis.  A \ncomprehensive support package from ADB is needed.  \n \nto \nThe  program  cluster  period  will  be \n30 December 2011.  A  single-tranche  loan  of  $10.0  million  is  to  be \ndisbursed  under  subprogram  1  when  the  Government  has  met  the \n\nfrom  1  January  2008 \n\nis  anchored \n\nthe  ERSP \n\nto  reduce \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto  $16.0  million,  comprising \n\nconditions  for  effectiveness.  Subprogram  2,  a  single-tranche  loan  of \n$6.0 million,  will  be  presented  for  consideration  and  approval  by  ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors depending on the progress achieved in implementing \nsubprogram  1,  including  compliance  with  the  proposed  policy  actions, \nand the readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding policy \nreform  measures.  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  considered  by  the \nBoard about 24 months after the subprogram 1 loan takes effect. \n \ntwo \nThe  program  cluster  amounts \nsubprograms  ($10.0  million  and  $6.0  million).  The  loan  of  $10.0  million \n(subprogram  1)  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  15  years  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nLoan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for  items  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries.  Ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources will be excluded. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed to the borrower as provided in ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram  Loans  (1998).  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will \nrequire a certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the \ntotal  imports  of  the  Cook  Islands,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loans to be \ndisbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use \nof  the  loan  proceeds  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n \nThe Government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the \nproceeds  of  the  loans  are  used  to  support  public  expenditure  objectives \nunder the program. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) will be the \nexecuting  agency  for  the  program.  The  existing  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Commission (comprising heads of MFEM, the Office of the \nPrime  Minister,  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General,  and  the  Ministry  of \nForeign Affairs) will be the program coordinating committee and will meet \nat least quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe  program,  and  to  guide  and  direct  the  activities  of  the  executing \nagency. \n \nThe  program  will  provide  broadly  distributed  benefits  by  helping  to \ncounter  the  negative  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  and  setting  a \nfoundation  for  higher,  private sector\u2013led  economic  growth  over  the \nmedium  to  long  term.  The  vulnerable  will  benefit  from  the  improved \ntargeting of government programs. \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nBenefits \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nThe key risks are as follows: (i) technical and legal problems delay capital \nexpenditure;  (ii)  the  Government  has  insufficient  capacity  to  implement \nthe program; (iii) a shortfall in government financing precludes optimized \ninfrastructure  and  implement  policy  actions  linked  to  the  program; \n(iv) there is insufficient community support for the Government\u2019s actions; \nand  (v) the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  program  wanes  in  the \nlead-up to the 2010 election. \n \nThe program is designed to mitigate  these risks.

The ERSP program cluster was prepared by a \njoint team of representatives of the Government of the Cook Islands (the Government) and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix for subprogram 1, including triggers for subprogram \n2, are in Appendix 2.  \n\nII. \n\nTHE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \n\nA. \n\nThe Cook Islands Economy before the Global Economic Crisis \n\n2. \nThe Cook Islands economy grew for 6 consecutive years until 2004 as it recovered from \nthe economic crisis of the mid-1990s, the result of an overly ambitious expansion of the public \nsector.  An  unsustainably  large  public  service,  a  major  public  investment  program,  and \ngovernment guarantees for a hotel development that failed had raised the ratio of public debt to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  141%.  The  New  Zealand  dollar  replaced  the  Cook  Islands \ndollar  as  the  national  currency  and  more  than  half  of  the  public  service  was  retrenched.  A \nbroad range of economic and public sector reforms proved to be a catalyst for growth, providing \nthe foundation for a robust expansion in private sector activity.1 \n \nThe economy is tourism led (Figure 1), with annual visitors of around 100,000 persons, \n3. \nalmost  six  times  the  resident  population  (Appendix  3  gives  an  overview  of  key  economic \nissues).  The  reform  program  saw  economic  growth  average  6.0%  yearly  in  the  6  years  up  to \n2004, substantially above the long-run average yearly growth rate of 3.5%. Damage caused by \ncyclone  Hera  in  2005  and  the  consequent  disruption  of  tourism  brought  the  post-reform \nexpansion  to  an  end.  Almost  no  growth  was  recorded  in  2005,  and  only  slight  growth  in  real \nGDP in 2006 and 2007.  \n \n4. \nThe weakening in growth since 2004 is linked to slow progress in deepening economic \nreform. Productivity growth and the buildup of physical and human capital have fallen short of \nwhat is needed to sustain the growth momentum. Notably, public investment has been low, and \ntighter  restrictions  on  foreign  investment  have  held  back  the  private  sector  from  accumulating \nproductive  capital.  Local  labor  is  close  to  fully  employed;  foreign  labor  is  needed  to  meet  the \ndemand and avoid a rising cost structure. However, concerns regarding the potential dilution of \nthe country\u2019s identity, with both social and marketing implications, appear to be contributing to \ninertia in providing flexible, efficient access to foreign labor.  \n \n5. \nA  deterioration  in  the  underlying  economic  fundamentals  is  evident  in  the  pattern  of \ngrowth. The reforms had led to a rapid increase in private investment. Foreign direct investment \nplayed  a  large  role  at  the  start,  before  bank  lending  gained  prominence.  Commercial  building \ninvestment, particularly in tourism accommodation and other tourism-based activities, expanded \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB  supported  the  Cook  Islands  economic  reform.

The  economy, \ngiven  its  dependence  on  tourism,  is  highly  exposed  to  the  external  slowdown.  It  contracted  in \n2008 as visitor arrivals declined by 3.1%. A large decline from high-spending segments of the \nmarket\u2014the  key  northern  hemisphere  markets  of  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  Europe\u2014\noutweighed a rise in tourism from New Zealand. High fuel prices and the resulting high inflation, \nplus  the  loss  of  one  of  two  international  freight-shipping  services,  also  further  sapped  the \neconomy  in  2008.  A  weakening  in  a  range  of  economic  indicators  points  to  a  generalized \neconomic  slowdown.  Preliminary  official  estimates  put  the  contraction  at  1.1%,  but  the \nGovernment has already indicated that it could be as large as 3.0%. \n \n7. \nThe  latest  data  point  to  a  continuation  of  weak  economic  conditions  into  2009. \nCommercial bank lending to business was down by 8.3% in June 2009 from a year earlier, and \ncar  and  truck  registrations  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  were  both  more  than  40%  below \nregistrations in the same period in 2008. Tax revenue collections were down by 3.5% in FY2009 \nin nominal terms and an estimated 8.2% in real terms. \n \n8. \ninflationary  environment  are  placing \nconsiderable pressure on government expenditure programs, and could, in turn, add to pressure \non vulnerable members of the community from a softening in labor demand and an escalation in \nthe cost of living. Women are particularly vulnerable, as they are overrepresented in lower-paid \njobs in tourism. \n \n9. \nThe  overall  weakening  is  taking  place  despite  a  small,  recent  pickup  in  visitor  arrivals. \nTotal  visitor  arrivals  were  down  in  the  12  months  up  to  May  2009,  but  up  by  1.3%  in  the \n\nThe  weak  revenue  performance  and \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n12 months  up  to  June 2009.  Arrivals  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  recovered,  more \nthan offsetting a continuing decline in arrivals from the Northern Hemisphere. The rise in arrivals \nfrom Australia and New Zealand appears to be a result of intensive marketing and a substitution \naway from the Fiji Islands.  \n \n10. \nTotal visitor arrivals and the economy will receive a temporary boost in the second half \nof 2009 from a different kind of tourism, via the World Youth Netball Championships, the South \nPacific  Mini  Games,  and  a  number  of  major  regional  conferences  (e.g.,  the  Forum  Economic \nMinisters\u2019  Meeting).  Short-lived  once-offs  with  low  yields  in  most  cases,  these  events  will  not \nreverse the underlying weakness in the economy.  \n \n11. \nof June 2009. The resultant erosion of purchasing power is a source of economic stress.  \n \n12.  While  a  small  expansion  in  the  overall  economy  is  possible  in  2009,  a  contraction  is \nlooming in 2010 in the absence of corrective action by the Government. Business investment is \nstill weak, no major special events are expected, and tourism activity is projected to soften as \nthe Fiji Islands recovers its tourists.  \n\nInflation averaged 7.8% in 2008 and remained high at 11.2% on a year-on-year basis as \n\nC. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Response \n\n1. \n\nFiscal Measures \n\nThe  Government  acted  early  to  counter  the  economic  slowdown  (Supplementary \n\n13. \nAppendix A). The FY2010 budget was framed to carry out the following fiscal strategies: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nimplement  new  initiatives  that  will  stimulate  the  economy  (such  as  increased \ncapital expenditure); \nmaintain  or  increase  expenditure  on  the  delivery  of  public  services  to  the \nvulnerable; \nlimit new expenditure initiatives that involve significant recurrent costs or do not \ncontribute to productivity improvements; \nensure  that  the  number  of  people  employed  in  the  public  service  is  justified  by \nthe delivery of the needed outputs and the desired outcomes; \ndevelop and implement  policies that will minimize costs to the Government and \nyield  savings  for  use  in  priority  areas,  e.g.,  suspend  the  payment  of  3-year \nlong-service  bonuses,  performance  bonuses,  and,  where  warranted,  other \nincrements in the public service during this fiscal period; and \nalign  government  expenditure  and  revenue  with  the  medium-term  goals  of  Te \nKaveinga Nui, the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2007\u20132010.2 \n\n \n14. \nThe  main  initiative  adopted  was  a  large  increase  in  capital  expenditure  (Table  1), \nbringing  forward  planned  capital  expenditure  to  hasten  infrastructure  development  and  give  a \nshort-term  boost  to  the  economy.  The  proposed  public  investment  program  can  help  turn  the \neconomy  around,  first  by  countering  the  downturn,  and  then  by  helping  to  deal  with  the \nunderlying  economic  weaknesses  caused  by  past  underinvestment  in  infrastructure.

Fiscal  space  will  thus  be  created  for  higher  capital  expenditure.  However,  to \nachieve this overall restraint, the same proportional controls are applied to both high priority and \nlower  priority  activities  of  ministries.  A  prioritized  approach  would  have  helped  minimize  the \npotential adverse effects of the expenditure restraint.  \n \n\nTable 1: Fiscal Aggregates \n\n Item \n\nUnit \n\nFY2005 \n\nGovernment revenue \n\nRevenue \n\n- tax revenue \n\n- real tax revenue \n\nGovernment expenditure \n\nTotal expenditure \n\nCapital expenditure \n\nCurrent expenditure \n\n- personnel costs \n\n- personnel costs \n\nBudget balance \n\nOverall balance \n\nBudget financing requirement \nGeneral government net debt \n\nGross debt \n\nCash and liquid assets \n\nNet debt \n\n \n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\nannual \nchange, %  \n \n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\n% of current \nexpenditure \n \n % of GDP \n\n$ million \n\n \n\n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\n % of GDP \n\nFY2006\n(est) \n \n\nFY2007\n(est) \n \n\nFY2008\n(est) \n \n\nFY2009\n(est) \n \n\nFY2010\n(bud) \n \n\n39.0  \n\n27.1  \n\n7.0  \n\n36.4  \n\n4.6  \n\n33.5  \n\n13.8  \n\n41.2  \n\n2.6  \n\n(4.7) \n\n21.2 \n\n15.3 \n\n5.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n39.8  \n\n27.5  \n\n(0.1) \n\n39.7  \n\n6.4  \n\n35.0  \n\n14.5  \n\n41.4  \n\n \n\n \n\n0.1  \n\n(0.1) \n\n \n\n21.1 \n\n13.9 \n\n7.2 \n\n43.9  \n\n28.3  \n\n0.9  \n\n44.8  \n\n6.6  \n\n39.9  \n\n14.8  \n\n37.0  \n\n \n\n \n\n(0.8) \n\n1.8  \n\n \n\n16.8 \n\n14.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n37.6  \n\n25.7  \n\n(8.2) \n\n48.7  \n\n12.2  \n\n38.3  \n\n13.6  \n\n35.5  \n\n \n\n \n\n(11.0) \n\n21.0  \n\n \n\n19.9 \n\n9.1 \n\n10.8 \n\n38.7  \n\n24.9  \n\n(1.4) \n\n54.8  \n\n20.4  \n\n35.9  \n\n13.2  \n\n36.8  \n\n \n\n \n\n(16.1) \n\n35.2  \n\n34.8 \n\n9.5 \n\n25.2 \n\n \n\n37.2  \n\n25.7  \n\n3.3  \n\n34.6  \n\n4.1  \n\n32.0  \n\n13.1  \n\n41.0  \n\n2.6  \n\n(4.7) \n\n37.9 \n\n18.9 \n\n19.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n( ) = negative, bud = budget, est = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Fiscal aggregates prepared on a government financial statistics basis.

Rarotonga. various years; Cook Islands Statistics Office. \n\n \n16. \nThe revenue projections are conservative and realistic. Low growth in internal revenue is \nprojected  for  FY2010,  with  most  of  the  increase  resulting  from  a  higher  rate  of  departure  tax. \nWithout that increase, revenue collections would be flat (in nominal terms). \n \n17. \nThe planned budget deficit is affordable, given current low debt levels, but it is large by \nthe  Cook  Islands\u2019  own  standards  and  those  of  other  countries.  Public  debt  will  nonetheless \nremain  below  reasonable  thresholds  (Appendix  4).  For  fiscal  sustainability,  planned  capital \nexpenditure  must  be  directed  to  sound  capital  projects,  particularly  those  that  directly  or \nindirectly bring in the funds to service the new debt. The growth in operating expenditure must \nbe restrained to allow future budgets to meet rising maintenance and debt service costs.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n18. \nThe  Government  has  acknowledged  the  uncertain  outlook  for  revenue  in  the  global \neconomic downturn, and recognizes that it must contain operating expenditure if it is to continue \nto  fund  priority  capital  expenditure.  Exercising  restraint  on  staffing  costs  will  be  particularly \nimportant,  as  these  costs  already  account  for  a  high  share  of  operating  expenditure  and  the \nwage bill is high by regional standards (as a ratio to GDP).  \n \n19. \nThe subsidies to private businesses also warrant attention. The total cost of subsidies to \nAir  New  Zealand  alone  is  of  the  order  of  4%  of  operating  expenditure,  and  interest  rate \nsubsidies  took  up  a  further  2.7%  of  operating  expenditure  in  the  FY2009  budget.  Allocating \nsubsidies via competitive tender would (where practical) help minimize their cost while ensuring \nthe use of funds to best effect. \n \n20. \nThe domestic banking sector is already partially dependent on funds secured offshore to \nmeet  domestic  needs.  The  sizable  fiscal  expansion  now  planned  must  also  be  financed  from \noffshore sources. As the Cook Islands currency is the New Zealand dollar, such borrowing can \nhave no adverse effects on the balance of payments or exchange rate.  \n \n21. \nThe  FY2010  budget  deficit  is  to  be  financed  from  ongoing  loans  from  ADB,  and \nadditional loans from the People\u2019s Republic of China are being negotiated (Table 2). New ADB \nfinancing will take the form of the first disbursement from the proposed ERSP, which provides \nfor a cluster of loans comprising two subprograms totaling $16.0 million. The first subprogram of \n$10.0  million  is  planned  for  disbursement  in  October  2009,  and  the  second  subprogram  of \n$6.0 million in October 2011 (indicative timing). \n \n \n\nTable 2: Major Recent and Proposed Loans \n\nTiming of Investment \nCompletion \n(preliminary) \n \nFY2011 \n\nStart \n \nFY2009 \n\nLoan Amount \nUS$ \nmilliona \n \n10.5 \n\nNZ$ \nmilliona \n \n15.7 \n\n(% of \nGDP) \n \n4.8 \n\nLender \n \nPRC \n\nEconomic Recovery Support Program \nRehabilitation and upgrade of \n\nADB \nPRC \n\nFY2010 \nFY2010 \n\nFY2012 \nFY2014 \n\n23.8 \n37.5 \n\n16.0 \n25.2 \n\n7.3 \n11.5 \n\n \n \nLocal bank \n\nADB \n \n \n\n \n \nFY2009 \n\nFY2010 \n \n \n\n \n \nFY2010 \n\nFY2012 \n \n \n\n77.0 \n \n6.5 \n\n20.4 \n26.9 \n103.9 \n\n51.7 \n \n4.4 \n\n13.7 \n18.1 \n69.8 \n\n23.6 \n \n2.0 \n\n6.3 \n8.2 \n31.9 \n\na Based on an exchange rate of NZ$1 = $0.6712 as of 10 August 2009. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: ADB estimates based on data supplied by MFEM. \n \n\nUse \nGeneral government sector \nConstruction of sports facilities and \nnew headquarters for the Ministry \nof Education \n\nRarotonga main roads and water \nsupply ring main \nSubtotal \n\nPublic  enterprises \nUpgrade of Rarotonga Airport \n\nTerminal \n\nUpgrade of Avatiu Harbor \nSubtotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nThe capital expenditure to be funded through the loans in support of the FY2010 budget \n22. \nwill  be  implemented  over  3\u20134-years.3  The  ratio  of  government  capital  expenditure  to  GDP  is \nexpected to be 3%\u20139% of GDP over the period (Figure 2). \n \nEven  with  the  large  increase  in  capital  expenditure  budgeted  for  FY2010,  only  low \n23. \neconomic  growth  is  expected  in  2010.

The  current  infrastructure  lacks  the  capacity  and \nquality to meet existing demand, and inadequate services in water and sanitation services pose \ndirect risks to the natural environment and public health. The inadequacy of infrastructure is an \nincreasingly tighter constraint on new development, especially on Rarotonga and Aitutaki, where \ntourism  is  concentrated.  There  is  a  growing  risk  that  pollution  in  the  lagoons  of  these  islands, \nwith  associated  impact  on  health,  would  impair  the  country\u2019s  reputation  as  a  clean  and  safe \ntourism destination. Increased investment is also needed to help climate-proof the Cook Islands, \nnotably the outer islands. \n \n25. \nThe  need  to  increase  public  investment  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  service \nstandards, while achieving a pattern of commercial activity that is ecologically sustainable, will \ntest  the  fiscal  position  of  the  country  as  well  as  the  maintenance  of  governance  standards. \nStrengthened infrastructure is (i) at the core of an extensive policy dialogue between ADB and \nthe Government, (ii) the priority area of technical assistance (TA), and the strategic focus of the \ncurrent country partnership strategy.  \n \n26. \nAn  infrastructure  master  plan  (IMP),  developed  with  ADB  support  in  2006\u20132007,  was \nlaunched  in  2007  (see  box).4  At  an  estimated  total  capital  cost  of  $175  million  over  20  years \n\n                                                 \n3  Cook Islands\u2019 financial management legislation allows appropriations for  a given  year to  be spent in future  years \nwithout reappropriation. Hence, the large fiscal expansion in the FY2009 and FY2010 budgets provide for both a \nshort-term fiscal stimulus and a medium-term expansion in public investment. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n(around 90% of annual GDP), the IMP presents a major challenge to the fiscal and institutional \ncapacity of the public sector and the local construction industry. But such an ambitious plan is \naffordable  if  investments  are  carefully  selected  to  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth \nand development partners provide concessional funding.  \n \n27. \nThe  IMP  acknowledges  that  the  infrastructure  sector  suffers  from  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity constraints affecting operations, cost recovery, and hence the supply and \nquality of basic infrastructure services. Institutional arrangements are fragmented, overlapping, \nand uncoordinated. These weaknesses have resulted in ineffective management and a lack of \nclear ownership of policies, planning, and regulatory responsibility (Appendixes 5 and 6). \n \n\n \n\nThe Infrastructure Master Plan Priority Investments \n\nThe  physical  infrastructure  in  the  Cook  Islands  is  in  need  of  substantial  investment.  Shortcomings  in \ninfrastructure increase business costs and constrain development by falling short of users\u2019 needs.  \n\nThe road  network  in  the  tourism-intensive  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  is a priority.  Upgrades are  needed  to \nmeet the demand from rising vehicle ownership and tourism, to lessen congestion and the incidence of \nserious  crashes  (including  fatalities),  and  to  climate-proof  the  roads  from  possible  coastal  erosion  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  rise  in  sea  levels  induced  by  climate  change.  Health  problems  from  pollution  in \nRarotonga\u2019s  lagoon  provide  early  warning  of  the  potential  cost  of  not  addressing  the  environmental \nstresses created by expansion in tourism. Such episodes may become more frequent if solid and liquid \nwaste management infrastructure is not upgraded. Tourism development in some parts of Rarotonga and \nin  Aitutaki  has  been  curtailed  by  insufficient  water  supplies,  and  both  islands  are  susceptible  to  water \nshortages during dry periods because there is little storage capacity. \n\nIn the transport sector, the main international wharf on Rarotonga has reached the end of its useful life \nand  is  in  urgent  need  of  major  investment.  The  wharf  must  be  realigned  to  allow  the  berthing  of  larger \nvessels (including cruise ships). Harbor facilities in most outer islands are inadequate or nonexistent. The \nterminal  building  at  the  international  airport  is  being  upgraded  to  comply  with  international  civil  aviation \nregulations,  and  aging navigation  equipment  requires  replacement.  While  telecommunications coverage \nis  good,  the  quality  of  the  service  is  poor  and  prices  are  relatively  high.  Energy  costs  are  among  the \nhighest in the Pacific; energy efficiency must improve to reduce costs. \n\nThe infrastructure master plan (IMP) was conceived as a response to the five damaging cyclones in 2005. \nAt first, therefore, it emphasized the need for resilience by minimizing the harmful effects of disasters, and \nwas weighted toward the outer islands, while excluding government buildings and investments prioritized \nby the state-owned enterprises. That first IMP identified a prioritized and sequenced set of investments \nfor the next 20 years at an estimated total cost of $175 million.  \n\nThe IMP was adopted through the NSDP 2007\u20132010, Te Kaveinga Nui, and is at the core of the fifth of \nthe  NSDP\u2019s  eight  strategic  goals:  \u201cA  strong  basic  infrastructure  base  to  support  national  development.\u201d \nThe Cook Islands vision \u201cTo enjoy the highest quality of life consistent with the aspirations of our people, \nand  in  harmony  with  our  culture  and  environment\u201d  can  be  met  only  with  environmentally  sensitive \nimprovements in infrastructure. \n\nThe  coverage  of  the  IMP  has  since  been  extended  to  all  sectors  and  national  needs.  The  IMP  is  now \nviewed  as  a  living  plan  that  will  evolve  to  meet  emerging  needs  and  be  responsive  to  changing \ncommunity and economic priorities. Capital expenditure projects currently prioritized include wharves and \nharbors ($33.2 million), government buildings ($20.8 million), airports ($9.5 million), roads ($8.5 million), \nsewerage and waste management ($5.6 million), and cyclone management centers ($5.4 million). \n\nSources:  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management;  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Planning;  MPC  Group \nInternational.  2007.

The  review  indicated  that,  for \nhigh-quality  capital  spending,  government  agencies  must  follow  a  transparent  and  robust \nprocess  of  identifying,  evaluating,  prioritizing,  funding,  and  implementing  investment  projects, \nand the projects must have clear social and economic benefits and achieve a satisfactory rate of \nreturn. \n \nAn  infrastructure  governance  framework  (IGF)  was  therefore  developed  with  ADB \n29. \nsupport.5  The  IGF  is  a  set  of  government-initiated  policy  principles  and  actions  designed  to \nachieve  sound  governance,  investment  decisions,  and  operational  management  in  the \ninfrastructure sector (Appendix 7). The components of the IGF are \n \n\ninstitutional  arrangements  to  support  good  governance,  sound  investment \ndecisions,  and  the  efficient  and  responsive  operation  of  publicly  provided \ninfrastructure; \n\ncapacity  development  within  the  sector  institutions  to  enable  them  to  perform \ntheir designated functions efficiently; \n\nclear  and  consistent  regulatory  policies  for  the sector  and subsectors  that  carry \nout  the  NSDP,  including  service  standards,  user  charges  and  cost  recovery, \nfinancial  return  on  public  assets,  and  environmental  and  social  responsibilities \nsuch as community service obligations; \n\nan agreed process of infrastructure investment planning and implementation that \napplies  consistent  analysis,  ranking,  prioritization,  approval,  and  procurement \nmethods; and6 \n\narrangements  for sustainable  asset  management,  including  asset  inventory  and \nvaluation,  assessment  of  condition,  and  provisions  for  routine,  periodic,  and \nemergency maintenance, repair, and renewal. \n\n \n30. \nThe IGF prioritizes improvements in the governance arrangements for infrastructure as a \nsound base for moving forward with environmentally sustainable infrastructure investment. The \nGovernment  now  looks  forward  to  implementing  this  broad  governance  framework  quickly  for \nvetting  infrastructure  proposals  and  optimizing  asset  management,  cost  recovery  possibilities, \nasset performance, and private sector participation. Elements of the IGF were endorsed by key \ngovernment  agencies  in  2007.  In  2008,  the  cabinet  took  key  decisions  that  established \nhigh-level  committees  to  oversee  its  development  and  implementation:  (i)  the  National \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Cook Islands for Preparing the Infrastructure Development Project. Manila \n\n(TA 7022-COO). \n\n6 The IMP initially prioritized projects on the  basis  of six criteria: (i) Will the project contribute to  national economic \ndevelopment and growth? (ii) Will the project contribute to national revenue? (iii) Will the project lead to improved \nliving  standards?  (iv)  Will  the  project  contribute  to  a  better  environment?  (v)  Will  the  project  provide  an  enabling \nenvironment for private sector involvement? and (vi) Will the project promote community support and involvement? \nThe prioritization process has since become less structured. An objective and transparent process of prioritization \nis  now  needed  that  draws  on  prioritization  criteria  aligned  with  current  expectations  and  backed  by  checks  on \neconomic and financial viability. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nSustainable  Development  Commission  (NSDC)  reporting  directly  to  the  cabinet,  and  (ii)  the \nInfrastructure Committee attached to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC).7 \n \n31. \nThe  Cook  Islands  also  needs  to  catch  up  with  improvements  made  elsewhere  in  the \nregion  (e.g.,  in  telecommunications  and  in  the  enabling  environment  for  investors)  to  become \nmore  competitive  internationally.  A  range  of  structural  initiatives  has  been  identified  for  this \npurpose. Renewed effort in these areas will support the economic recovery. \n\n3. \n\nProtection for the Vulnerable \n\n32. \nBeyond  a  general  pattern  of  disadvantage  to  the  outer  islands,  the  vulnerable  in  the \nCook Islands are those who are least able to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and \nwho  often  have  special needs  and  require  extra  help  (Appendix  8).  The  reasons  given  for  the \nvulnerability include a breakdown in traditional family support systems, the emigration of family \nincome earners, the rising cost of living, and social and community obligations. The vulnerable \nare identified as the elderly, the unemployed, single parents, children, the disabled, squatters, \nand victims of crime.  The last two categories are by far the smallest. \n \n33. \nThere  is  no  formal  system  in  the  Cook  Islands  for  targeting  the  vulnerable  other  than \nfairly  loosely,  through  the  distribution  of  sizable  social  security  payments  (the  equivalent  of \naround 3.5% of GDP). There is almost no systematic method of identifying the disadvantaged, \ntheir needs, and the best means of addressing these needs. Because of the widely held\u2015but \nnot  necessarily  correct\u2015perception  that  good  health,  education,  and  living  standards  are  well \ndistributed in the Cook  Islands and there is therefore little poverty, poverty reduction does not \nfigure prominently in government plans and policies. While there has long been an emphasis on \nequity in public policy, especially in access to basic services such as health and education, and \nin outer-island development, more could be done to increase the focus on the disadvantaged.  \n \n34. \nThere  is  little  hard  evidence  of  the  impact  of  the  high  inflation  triggered  by  high \ninternational  commodity  prices  and  the  concurrent  economic  downturn.  However,  it  is \nreasonable to expect the needs of the vulnerable to be on the rise. Women with lower-paid jobs \nin the tourism industry are potentially the most affected. This raises the imperative to rebalance \ngovernment  programs  in  favor  of  targeted  support  for  the  vulnerable.  Such  measures  are, \nhowever,  not  explicit  in  the  FY2010  budget  (in  contrast  to  the  stated  intention  of  the  budget \nstrategy). \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n35. \nThe  program  is  expected  to  achieve  higher  and  more-inclusive  economic  growth \n(program  impact).  The  focus  will  be  on  strengthening  priority  elements  of  the  governance  and \ninstitutional  framework,  and  improving  opportunities  for  the  vulnerable.  ADB  financing  will  be \nused to help meet the Government\u2019s overall budget financing needs, which have increased as a \nresult  of  its  greater  need  for  infrastructure  and  building  investment.  The  program  is  thus \n\n                                                 \n7  The NSDC comprises the heads of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM), the Office of the \n\nPrime Minister, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nexpected to initiate economic recovery with protection of the vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal \nposition (program outcome).  \n \n36. \nThe process of stimulating inclusive economic growth in the Cook Islands is presented in \nFigure 3. It suggests that economic growth can be stimulated through a program that addresses \nthe governance and institutional environment, along with financing to allow faster accumulation \nof  more-productive  human  and  physical  capital.  These  actions  must  be  in  harmony  with  the \nconservation of the natural environment and adaptation to climate change, in part because the \ndomestic tourism industry rests on the natural environment, and require better management to \nincrease the carrying capacity of the natural environment. Removing the bottlenecks that inhibit \nprivate  sector  development  will  promote  business  investment,  the  key  to  sustaining  economic \ngrowth.  These  actions,  which  will  address  binding  constraints  on  the  domestic  economy,  form \nthe substance of the ERSP. The focus will be on strengthening the governance and institutional \nframework,  while  providing  needed  external  financing  and  support  for  targeted  policy  and \ngovernment expenditure in favor of the vulnerable. \n \nThe  actions  will  provide  the  Cook  Islands  with  a  growth  dividend  as  the  currently \n37. \ndepressed external demand turns around. The economy would thus recover faster than would \notherwise be the case, and begin to return to at least the long-run growth rate. Extra effort will \nbe  needed  through  this  transition  to  provide  opportunities  for  the  vulnerable  to  benefit  from  a \nhigher share in economic growth.  \n \n\nFigure 3: The Economic Recovery Process \n\nPublic \nPublic \ninfrastruc-\ninfrastruc-\nture\nture\n\nBusiness \nBusiness \ninvestment\ninvestment\n\nHuman \nHuman \ncapital\ncapital\n\nNatural \nNatural \nenviron-\nenviron-\nment\nment\n\nStronger \n\ngovernance\n\n+\n\nand \n\n=\n\ninstitutional \n\nframework \n\nand financing\n\nPublic \nPublic \ninfrastructure\ninfrastructure\n\nBusiness \nBusiness \ninvestment\ninvestment\n\nHuman \nHuman \ncapital\ncapital\n\nNatural \nNatural \nenvironment\nenvironment\n\nFavorable external \nconditions (e.g. \nrising tourism \ndemand)\n\nInclusive \nInclusive \nand \nand \nsustainable \nsustainable \neconomic \neconomic \ngrowth\ngrowth\n\nEnhanced \nopportunity for \nthe most \nvulnerable\n\nCurrent situation\n\nTarget situation\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe  ERSP  is  a  cluster  program  of  two  subprograms  (the  design  of  the  second  being \n38. \ndependent  on  the  outcome  of  the  first  and  the  Government\u2019s  emerging  priorities).  This  report \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ndeals  mainly  with  subprogram  1,  but  some  indicative  components  of  subprogram  2  are  also \ncovered. \n \n39. \nSubprogram 1 is a single-tranche operation with a well-defined framework aligned with \nthe  Government\u2019s  NSDP.  The  policy  reform  agenda  is  supported  by  ongoing  advisory  TA  to \nimplement  and  deepen  reforms  over  the  ERSP  period.8  Consideration  of  subprogram  2  will \ndepend  on  satisfactory  progress  toward  its  policy  triggers.  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be \nsubmitted  to  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  for  consideration  in  2011  after  the  key  triggers  are \ncompleted.  \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions  \n\nThe ERSP will provide an immediate response to the global economic crisis and support \n40. \nfor  continued  economy  recovery.  Subprogram  1  will  enable  the  Government  to  ease  its  fiscal \nstance  in  the  immediate  to  short  term  to  avoid  further  economic  contraction.  Targeted  actions \nsupport  the  vulnerable.  A  strengthened  governance  and  institutional  framework  and  loan \nfinancing  will  improve  the  quality  of  capital  expenditure,  and  allow  the  backlog  of  priority \ninfrastructure and other building investment to be reduced. Increased construction activity will lift \naggregate  demand  and  economic  activity.  The  Government  is  committed  to  strengthening \ninfrastructure investment processes and infrastructure governance to promote sustained growth \nin the medium term.  \n \n41. \nSubprogram 1 will have five outputs: (i) higher capital expenditure by the Government to \nboost  economic  activity,  (ii)  structural  and  governance  improvements,  (iii)  support  for  the \nvulnerable,  (iv)  fiscal  responsibility,  and  (v)  program  communication  and  ownership.  All  policy \nmeasures  under  subprogram  1  have  been  completed.  The  five  outputs  will  be  implemented \nconcurrently. Subprogram 2 will be structured across the same outputs as subprogram 1 and, \nagain, all areas will be implemented concurrently. \n \n42. \nThe  development  of  the  program  placed  priority  on  promoting  country  ownership  and \nkeeping  the  program  manageable,  given  the  capacity  limitations,  to  ensure  sustainable \noutcomes.  \n \n43. \nOutput  1:  Short-term  economic  boost  from  higher  capital  expenditure  by  the \nGovernment.  The  FY2010  budget  provides  for  a  large  increase  in  capital  expenditure  above \nthe FY2009 budget outcome estimate\u2014NZ$57.6 million as opposed to NZ$31.0 million. This is \na  key  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  response  to  the  economic  downturn  arising  from  the \nglobal economic crisis. Subprogram 1 will provide budget support to enable the Government to \nmeet this expenditure plan, bringing forward planned capital expenditure into the current budget \nyear  to  stimulate  the  economy.  The  increased  construction  activity  will  lift  aggregate  demand \nand economic activity.  \n \n44. \nThe  FY2010  budget  does  not  specify  the  new  investments  that  will  be  made,  although \nprojects are being readied for the main airport, roads, and water supply on Rarotonga and key \npublic  buildings.  In  view  of  the  urgency  of  some  projects,  a  range  of  funding  options  is  being \nconsidered, and the Government is in discussions with the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nfunding of the Rarotonga main road and water main upgrade, and with commercial lenders for \n\n                                                 \n8  Notably,  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  Infrastructure  Services  Delivery  Improvement. \nManila  (TA  7287-COO);  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  for  Pacific  Economic  Management.  Manila  (TA  7280-\nREG, subprogram 1). \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nstage 2 of the Rarotonga airport terminal. ADB budget support will provide the Government with \nan  alternative  funding  option  for  speeding  up  the  start  of  either  of  these  projects,  or  for \nlaunching another priority investment. Rather than earmarking funds for particular infrastructure \ninvestments, the cabinet will decide whether or not to fund particular projects from the budget, \naccording to the recommendations of the NSDC, which will follow an agreed set of criteria for \nprioritizing investments. \n \n45. \nThe use of an improved process of prioritizing infrastructure investments, committed to \nby  the  cabinet  under  output  2,  will  ensure  the  quality  of  this  increased  capital  expenditure \n(paras. 46\u201349).  Better-quality  infrastructure  investments  will  yield  longer-term  benefits  beyond \nthe  short-term  economic  stimulus,  by  dealing,  at  least  in  part,  with  the  backlog  of  priority \ninfrastructure and other building investment, thereby providing a sound base for greater private \nsector growth.  \n \n46. \nOutput  2:  Structural  and  governance  improvements.  The  ERSP  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  structural  reforms  and  governance  improvements  across  the  infrastructure \nsectors. These improvements are vital to medium-term growth prospects, as weak infrastructure \nand poor management of infrastructure assets have held back private sector development and \nplaced  at  risk  the  natural  environment  on  which  the  domestic  tourism  industry  rests.  The \nimprovements  have  been  the  subject  of  ongoing  dialogue  with  the  Government  of  the  Cook \nIslands over a number of years, and include significant actions and commitments on the part of \nthe  Government  that  demonstrate  its  recognition  of  the  importance  of  sound  infrastructure \ndevelopment to economic growth.  \n \nSubprogram 1 will provide for cabinet endorsement of the IMP and its incorporation into \n47. \nthe  NSDP.  These  actions  will  elevate  the  development  role  accorded  to  infrastructure.  The \nsubprogram will  elicit  explicit  cabinet  commitment  to  a  transparent  and  objective  two-step \nprocess of prioritizing capital expenditure by the NSDC. The first step will require projects to be \nprioritized from the IMP on the basis of a multi-criteria analysis, taking into account economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental factors. In the second step, the highest-priority projects will \nbe  subjected  to  a  socioeconomic  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  to  verify  their  viability  and  ensure  a \npositive  net  present  value  before  funding  is  confirmed.  This  will  ensure  the  quality  of  the \nincreased capital expenditure under output 1 of the subprogram. \n \n48. \nThe management of the strengthened infrastructure investment pipeline is supported by \nthe  cabinet  endorsement  of  the  IGF.  The  IGF  will  be  implemented  across  all  infrastructure \nsectors  (roads,  airports,  ports  and  harbors,  government  buildings,  energy,  water  supply, \nsanitation and waste management). The IGF, when implemented, will provide for sector policy \nstatements  (inclusive  of  provisions  for  user  charges,  cost  recovery,  and  community  service \nobligations);  investment  criteria  and  plans;  asset  management;  and  forward  budgeting \nframeworks.  It  will  also  promote  common  approval  and  implementation  procedures  across  all \ncapital  expenditure  in  the  public  infrastructure  sector.  In  addition,  legislative  changes  will  be \nsupported  to  provide  for  institutional  improvements  and  reforms,  agency  responsibilities  and \npowers  for  public  infrastructure  provision,  ongoing  asset  maintenance  management,  internal \nand external audit, user charges and cost recovery, and multiyear budgeting. \n \n49. \nOrganizational and management elements of the IGF will also be implemented as part of \nsubprogram 1. The Ministry of Works has been merged with the Office of the Minister of Island \nAdministration to form the Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning.9 The new ministry focuses on \n\n                                                 \n9   This was formally adopted by the Government in October 2008.  \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nthat  keeps  approved \n\ninfrastructure  policy,  planning,  and  maintenance,  including  asset  management  for  both \nRarotonga and the outer islands. Two key committees were created in May 2008; these are the \nNSDC, reporting directly to the cabinet, and the Infrastructure Committee10 attached to the CIIC. \nThe  NSDC  reviews  all  development  projects  and  aligns  them  with  NSDP  priorities.  Prioritized \ninfrastructure  projects  are  then  passed  on  to  the  Infrastructure  Committee,  which  approves \nallocations  for  government- and  aid-funded  investment.  The  Infrastructure  Committee  and \nNSDC take on performance monitoring roles, thus effectively providing external oversight to the \nimplementation  of  development  projects  by  line  ministries.  The  creation  of  the  NSDC  and  the \ninfrastructure \nin  place  a  process \nInfrastructure  Committee  puts \ninvestments in line with the broad infrastructure development needs of the Cook Islands. \n \n50. \nOutput  3:  Support  for  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions.  The  vulnerable \nwithin the community are more exposed to the negative impact of the global financial crisis and \nhave fewer reserves with which to meet their needs. \n \n51. \nA review is  to be undertaken of the Cook Islands' social welfare system, with an issue \npaper for public consideration to be completed by end December 2009 and the final review to \nbe  completed  by  end  of  FY2010.  This  is  to  allow  for  inclusion  of  responsive  actions  in  the \nFY2011  budget,  where  inflation  adjustment  of  allowances  for  the  vulnerable  are  expected  to \nfigure  prominently.  This  is  potentially  an  important  step  in  the  current  high  inflationary \nenvironment, given that social welfare payments are often the main source of cash income for \nthe vulnerable. \n \n52. \nProvision  is  also  made  for  the  pilot-testing  of  the  performance  monitoring  of  services \nused  by  the  vulnerable.  The  pilot-testing  will  be  conducted on  the  geriatrics key  result  area  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Health.  This  key  result  area  supports  the  geriatric  ward  at  the  Rarotonga \nHospital, which serves as a de facto old people\u2019s home for infirm elderly people who have no \nfamily to care for them. There is no other residential facility for the elderly in the Cook Islands. \n \n53. \nIn  the  medium  term,  subprogram  2  will  broaden  the  use  of  performance  monitoring  of \nservices for the vulnerable, besides assisting in the review of the adequacy of benefits and the \nidentification of savings to be redirected to the vulnerable.11 \n \n54. \nOutput  4:  Maintenance  of  fiscal  responsibility.  Cook  Islands  demonstrated  a  strong \nsense of fiscal responsibility following the mid-1990s reform, guided by the Ministry of Finance \nand  Economic  Management  (MFEM)  Act  of  1995\u20131996  and  the  Manila  Agreement12  financial \nratios,  which  set  targets  for  debt  as  a  proportion  of  GDP,  government  personnel  costs  as  a \nproportion  of  GDP,  and  other  (non-personnel)  operating  costs  as  a  proportion  of  GDP.  The \nMFEM  Act  (Section  23[2][a])  sets  out  principles  of  fiscal  responsibility  (and  a  process  for \nreporting on compliance with these): \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10   The Infrastructure Committee appointed by the cabinet (decision CM [08] 311) comprises two private sector civil \nengineers  (one  of  whom  is  appointed  chair),  one  private  sector  architect,  and  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure  and  Planning,  MFEM,  the  Aid  Management  Department,  and  the  Cook  Islands  Investment \nCorporation, as well as a member of Parliament.  \n\n11   The Cook Islands has adopted a performance-based budget, with ministry outputs identified in the budget papers \nand tied to the performance-based contracts of the heads of ministries. However, the system is yet to be operated \nas  designed.  A  key  missing  link  is  the  regular  conduct  of  performance  assessments  by  the  Public  Service \nCommission (MFEM\u2019s responsibilities for the budget covers only financial matters). \n\n12  The  Manila  Agreement  of  1998,  supported  by  ADB  as  \u201chonest  broker,\u201d  facilitated  debt  rescheduling  and  a \n\nsignificant write-down of Cook Islands debt to official creditors. \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nmanaging  total  Crown  debt  at  prudent  levels  to  provide  a  buffer  against  factors \nthat may adversely affect the level of total Crown debt in the future, by ensuring \nthat, unless such levels have been achieved, the total operating expenses of the \nCrown  in  each  financial  year  are  less  than  its  total  operating  revenues  in  the \nsame financial year;  \nachieving and maintaining levels of Crown net worth that provide a buffer against \nfactors that may adversely affect the Crown\u2019s net worth in the future;  \nmanaging prudently the fiscal risks facing the Crown; and \npursuing  policies  that  are  consistent  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  predictability \nabout the level and stability of tax rates in future years. \n\n \nThe Government is committed to continuing to meet throughout the program period the \n\n55. \nprinciples of fiscal responsibility stated in the MFEM Act.  \n \n56. \nAlthough  the  term  of  the  Manila  Agreement  has  now  ended,  the  Government  sees \nbenefit  in  continuing  to  use  the  concept  of  operating  parameters.  The  ERSP  provides  for  a \ncabinet  commitment  to  update  and  refine  these  as  a  practical  management  tool  for  fiscal \nresponsibility. The use of these ratios will complement the principles of fiscal responsibility in the \nMFEM  Act.  ADB  will  assist  the  Cook  Islands  in  refining  and  updating  these  ratios through  the \nPacific Economic Management TA (footnote 8).  \n \n57. \nThe  Government  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  improve  the  budget  process  and \npresentation, including ongoing efforts to adopt medium-term budgeting (for full implementation \nin FY2011) and to present the budget in an internationally comparable format. The Government \ncommits to provide a statement of government operation in the FY2010 budget in accordance \nwith the International Monetary Fund\u2019s government finance statistics standards. \n \n58. \nUnder  the  program,  the  Government  is  committed  to  maintaining  the  financial \ncontribution needed to remain under Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services through FY2010. This \nopens the Cook Islands to external scrutiny and comparison, but also provides the Government \nwith  an  important  benchmark  by  which  to  measure  its  progress  and  performance  in  economic \nmanagement.  \n \n59. \nOutput  5:  Communication  and  ownership  of  economic  and  fiscal  management \ninitiatives.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  implementation  of  program  loans  call  for \nattention to the development of local awareness, understanding, and ownership of programs to \npromote  their  success.  The  program  commits  the  Government  to  the  development  of  a \ncommunications strategy that will explain \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  including  actions  to \naddress the needs of the vulnerable;  \nthe  transparent  and  objective  process  of  prioritizing  and  implementing  the  IMP; \nand \nthe role of infrastructure development and governance in supporting growth. \n\n \n60. \nThe  Government  already  places  considerable  public  finance  information  in  the  public \ndomain by publishing this on the MFEM website in a timely and comprehensive manner. There \nis also a track record of public consultation and participation in key development issues\u2014such \nas in the development of the NSDC. The communication and engagement strategy committed \nto, and subsequently implemented as part of this program, will build on this strong base. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nC. \n\nTriggers for Subprogram 2 \n\n61. \nThe development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe  next  2  years,  building  on  the  reform  momentum  from  subprogram  1.  Triggers  for \nsubprogram 2 are described in the policy matrix attached to the development policy letter. The \nindicative  milestones  for  subprogram  2  that  can  be  monitored  are  listed  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nBuilding on reforms under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented \n62. \nin 2011, and, subject to Board approval, will be financed by ADB. Subprogram 2 will continue to \nfocus  on  fiscal  consolidation,  but  there  will  be  a  stronger  focus  on  improvements  in \ninfrastructure  investment  and  governance  to  sustain  higher  growth,  and  on  progress  in  other \nareas that may emerge from policy dialogue and engagement with the Government in 2010 and \n2011. The expected time frame for the processing of subprogram 2 is only indicative and is not \nlimited to a specific time frame in the event of a delay. \n \n63.  While  subprogram  2  contains  targeted  policy  actions,  the  program  cluster  approach \nallows  an  appropriate  policy  response  to  unanticipated  changes  in  the  external  environment. \nThe conditions for the release of the subprogram 2 tranche will not be specified at the outset of \nthe ERSP, but will be determined in consultation with the Government on the basis of lessons \nfrom  subprogram  1.  These  conditions  are  likely  to  be  in  the  policy  areas  set  out  in  the \nsubprogram  2  triggers.  This  approach  will  ensure  that  the  ERSP  is  synchronized  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy agenda and is responsive to external environmental factors. \n\nD. \n\nLessons \n\n64. \nThe  design  of  the  ERSP  incorporates  the  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  program \nlending in the Pacific and elsewhere.13 Country ownership is maximized by anchoring the ERSP \nin Te Kaveinga Nui, the NSDP 2007\u20132010, and the use of government systems and processes. \nFurther, the ERSP is designed to assist the Government in achieving the strategy set out for the \nFY2010 budget.  \n \n65. \nThe  ERSP  is  backed  by  solid  diagnostics,  communication  and  awareness-raising \ninitiatives, and a commitment to a longer-term engagement through a flexible approach aimed at \nmaximizing country ownership.14 The focus is on a systematic approach to improving policy and \nplanning  capacity,  in  contrast  to  the  firefighting  role  adopted  under  ADB  program  loans  in  the \nmid-1990s. \n \n66. \nThe cluster approach responds to the lesson that program lending has not always been \nfirmly  based  on  an  assessment  of  achievable  rates  of  change,  and  has  been  too  inflexible, \ncontributing  to  program  delays.  In  this  case,  risk  is  heightened  by  the  imperative  to  make  the \ninitial disbursement early as a short-term boost to the economy. The time allowed for program \npreparation would therefore be too brief. The cluster approach gives the ERSP the flexibility to \ntailor the specific nature and timing of policy actions to the Cook Islands\u2019 circumstances at the \n                                                 \n13   Key  sources  of  lessons  are:  ADB.  2009.  Special  Evaluation  Study:  ADB\u2019s  Support  for  Public  Sector  Reforms  in \nthe  Pacific:  Enhance  Results  through  Ownership,  Capacity,  and  Continuity.  Manila;  ADB.  2001.  Special \nEvaluation  Study  on  Program  Lending.  Manila;  and  ADB.  1999.  Reforms  in  the  Pacific:  An  Assessment  of  the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. Manila. \n\n14   Program design is built on: broad-ranging diagnostic analysis by ADB; the policy framework presented in ADB\u2019s \nTaking  the  Helm:  A  Policy  Brief  on  a  Response  to  the  Global  Crisis;  and  ongoing  policy  dialogue  between  the \nGovernment, development partners, and private sector and civil society representatives. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\ntime  subprogram 2  is  formulated.  The  cluster  approach  minimizes  the  risk  of  jeopardizing \ntechnical  quality  by  having  to  compress  the  timetable.  Government  and  development  partner \nresources  can  focus  on  the  most immediate  policy  actions,  and  have  more  time  to  consider \nfollow-on actions. \n \n67. \nThe  cluster  approach  also  allows  extra  time  to  build  the  demand-driven  approach \nthrough firm country ownership. In this case, the impact of the global economic crisis is already \napparent  to  the  community  (through  the  economic  contraction  of  2008),  as  is  the  downside  of \ntoo-little  attention  to  infrastructure,  and  there  is  awareness  of  the  need  for  action  (evaluation \nstudies have pointed to the importance of such awareness). New structures and processes can \nerode  country  ownership  and  have  therefore  been  avoided.  Instead,  the  preparation  of  the \nERSP  has  emphasized  the  use  of  existing  institutional  structures  and  the  strengthening  of \nexisting systems and processes. The extension of the program period beyond the 2010 general \nelection  will  provide  the  flexibility  to  align  the  policy  actions  with  the  agenda  of  any  new \ngovernment.15  This  will  also  facilitate  the  reassessment  of  political  commitment  to  the  ERSP, \nwhich is considered critical given the long-term nature of the policy actions to be pursued.16  \n \n68. \nCountry ownership and endorsement is facilitated by a program that is relatively simple \nin  scope,  unlike  the  overly  complex  programs  developed  for  the  Pacific  in  the  1990s  (in \ncomparison,  the  Cook  Islands  program  in  the  mid-1990s  identified  124  policy  actions  and \n44 tranche conditions). The simple scope will increase the likelihood of sustaining the program \nimpact by keeping the program realistic and firmly within the capacity of the Cook Islands. The \nsequencing of actions has helped keep the scope simple. The relatively simple scope will also \nfacilitate the process of communicating and encouraging broad endorsement of the program. \n \n69. \nProgram lending evaluations support the basic rule that broad participation, in particular \nfrom  affected  groups  and  sectors,  is  critical  to  the  success  of  public  policy  reform.  The  ERSP \napplies this principle by (i) being anchored in the NSDP, which was prepared with the benefit of \na broad-based engagement with the community; (ii) drawing on the diagnostic work of the latest \nPacific Island Economic Report17 and the formulation of the IMP, both of which incorporated the \nfindings of extensive consultation in the main centers and the outer islands and with a range of \ncommunity  groups;  and  (iii)  including  as  one  of  five  output  areas,  the  promotion  of  public \ncommunication and ownership of economic and fiscal management initiatives. \n \n70. \nThe need for a long-term perspective and commitment identified by evaluation studies is \nimbedded in the ERSP. The program is seen as the next step in a long-term, sequenced reform \nprocess. Most policy actions, particularly those in the areas of infrastructure, and economic and \nfiscal management, build on earlier support from ADB. Many actions can be seen as follow-ons \nof  a  reform  process  begun  with  ADB  support  in  the  mid-1990s  (e.g.,  commitments  to  the \nprinciples of fiscal responsibility in the MFEM Act and to the updating of the Manila Agreement \nfinancial ratios).18 ADB support continues through the provision of the specialist skills needed to \n                                                 \n15   To  reduce  the  risk  that  the  political  commitment  will  wane,  a  broad  range  of  political  interests  was  actively \nengaged  in  the  preparation  of  the  IMP  and  the  IGF  and  the  various  groups  have  been  kept  abreast  of \ndevelopments. \n\n16   ADB\u2019s 1999 evaluation of the program loans of the 1990s (ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. Manila, p.167) found that \u201cthe most \nsignificant  success  factor  of  Bank  assistance  for  reforms  in  the  Pacific  is  also  the  most  obvious:  political \ncommitment  to  and  ownership  of  the  reform  program  is  essential.  Externally  imposed  reform  measures \n(conditionalities) that have little government ownership are doomed to certain failure.\u201d \n\n17   ADB. 2008.

The  policy  matrix  identifies  medium-term  program  directions  as \nguideposts for support that could follow the ERSP.  \n\nE. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n71. \nThe Cook Islands is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank \nGroup and therefore has limited access to financial support to address the impact of the global \neconomic crisis. This requires ADB to provide a comprehensive support package to the country. \n \n72. \nSupport  for  the  vulnerable  is  a  feature  of  the  program,  in  recognition  of  the  extra \nhardship imposed by the global economic crisis and the preceding episode of high international \ncommodity  prices.  This  support  will  involve  maintaining  expenditure  on  selected  essential \nservices  used  by  the  vulnerable,  maintaining  the  real  value  of  social  security  payments  to  the \nvulnerable,  and  explicitly  reorienting  government  programs  to  the  vulnerable.  In  addition,  a \nlinked project\u2014Supporting and Building Resilience of the Vulnerable\u2014is proposed for financing \nfrom  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  As  proposed,  the  linked  project  will  provide  (i) a \nshort-term  response  to  the  vulnerable  (including  unemployed  youth,  women,  low-income \nhouseholds,  and  people  with  disabilities) \nthrough \nto \ncash-for-work  and  cash  transfer  programs;  (ii)  a  pilot  social  welfare  and  social  protection \nprogram,  along  with  assessments  of  target  groups  and  the  feasibility  of  program  types,  and \npolicy recommendations as long-term measures to strengthen the social safety net; (iii) support \nfor  nongovernment  organizations  and  civil  society  activities \nthe  vulnerable;  and \n(iv) socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation of the situation of the vulnerable.  \n\ntheir  economic  status \n\nincrease \n\nfor \n\nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n73. \nThe  Government  has  requested  assistance  in  financing  the  program  in  the  form  of  a \nprogram  cluster  amounting  to  $16.0  million,  comprising  two  subprograms  ($10.0 million  and \n$6.0  million),  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  of  $10.0 million  (subprogram 1) \nwill  have  a  term  of  15 years  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year, and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The remaining cost to the budget of the actions included in \nthe policy matrix will be met by the Government. \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n74. \nProgram  Management.  MFEM  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  oversee  policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  actions  and  ensure  that  the  reforms  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and \nADB are duly carried out on time. TA resources will be provided to help the Government meet \nthe  tranche  conditions.  MFEM  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nsubprogram  1,  including  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance of all program records. The NSDC, the program coordinating committee, will meet \nat least quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of the program, and guide \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nsector.

It laid the foundation for the relatively high rates of economic growth \nachieved from 1998 to 2004 (Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nand direct the activities of the executing agency. The NSDC will invite implementing agencies to \nparticipate in meetings to discuss program implementation issues as appropriate.  \n \n75. \nImplementation  Period.  The  program  cluster  period  will  be  from  1  January  2008  to \n30 December  2011.  The  policy,  legislative,  organizational,  and  operational  changes  agreed  to \nwith the Government and set out in the policy matrix will be put in place during this period.  \n \n76. \nDisbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Cook  Islands  as  the \nrecipient  according  to  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram  loans.19  The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember countries; items in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources  are  excluded.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will \nrequire  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  the \nCook  Islands,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loan \nto be disbursed during a particular year. \n \n77. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  and  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be \nprocured  according  to  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Before \nwithdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  or  nominate  a  deposit  account  with  the  Bank  of  Cook \nIslands or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to receive the loan proceeds. The account will \nbe  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  according  to  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Subprogram  1 \nwill provide for retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred by the Government up to \n180  days  before  loan  effectiveness.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n78. \nsubprograms.  \n \n79. \nused to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \nProgram  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MFEM  will  (i)  within  3  months  of \n80. \nloan  effectiveness,  establish  and  maintain  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the  program, \nwhich will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix, \nand  directly  reflect  indicators  contained  in  the  IGF;  and  (ii)  monitor  and  report  to  ADB,  every \n6 months during the term of the program, the implementation of policy actions and their impact \non  budget  outcomes  and  public  enterprise  performance  (including  financial  and  performance \nindicators),  in  line  with  the  program  impact  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment.  As  the  outcomes  and  impact  of  the program  will  be  felt  most  clearly  beyond  the \nperiod  of  its  implementation,  these will  continue  to  be  monitored  by  MFEM.  The  monitoring  of \noutcomes  and  impact  will  be  useful  to  the  Government\u2019s  own  processes  and  decision  making \nand, hence, is not an onerous requirement. \n \n\nTranches. The program will be provided as a cluster loan comprising two single-tranche \n\nCounterpart  Funds.  Local  currency  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998.

In  cooperation  with  the  NSDC  and  in  conjunction  with  the  review \n81. \nmade under the associated TA,20 ADB will periodically review the progress of implementation, \nand assess the impact of the ERSP. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of \npolicy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for ERSP \nimplementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  NSDC  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies, \nwill  review  program  performance  12 months  after  loan  effectiveness  to  review  the  outcome  of \nsubprogram  1  and  begin  preparing  subprogram  2.  This  review  will  (i) evaluate \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  under  subprogram  1;  (ii)  assess  the  impact  on \neach sector; (iii) describe lessons identified during the program period; and (iv) outline reforms \nand  assistance  needed  for  sustained  economic  recovery,  to  enable  the  processing  of \nsubprogram 2. \n \n82. \nThe Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators for \nmonitoring ERSP implementation and evaluating its impact, within the overall ERSP design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n83. \nA  program  completion  report  will  be  prepared  for  each  subprogram,  with  an  overall \nreport  to  be  prepared  within  1  year  following  the  end  of  the  program  to  evaluate  its  overall \nsuccess.  The  Government  will  continue  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  program  at  least  until  the \nprogram completion report is prepared. \n \n84. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  has \nbeen  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  the  executing  agency.  Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the \nright  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan agreement. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  program.  These  actions  will \ncomplement the relatively high standard of financial accountability and anticorruption measures \nalready in place (Appendix 5).21 \n \n85. \nTechnical Assistance. Subproject 1 of the ADB TA for Pacific Economic Management: \nResponse  to  the  Global  Economic  Crisis  is  supporting  economic  monitoring,  analysis,  and \npolicy  advice  by  Pacific  developing  member  countries  in  a  joint  effort  with  development \npartners.22  The TA supports the strengthening of economic monitoring systems and using this \ninformation  to  provide  higher-quality  economic  advice.  The  TA  is  focused  on  assisting  in  the \nformulation and implementation of country-specific actions in response to the global economic \ncrisis. The preparation of action plans by the Cook Islands, with support from the TA, will inform \nthe preparation of subprogram 2 of the program loan. \n \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2009.

The TA is expected to result in the effective \ndelivery of environmentally sustainable infrastructure and infrastructure services (TA impact). It \nwill  establish  a  governance \ninfrastructure  management  and \ndevelopment  (TA  outcome),  characterized  by  common  processes  for  developing  infrastructure \ninvestment  plans,  effective  and  efficient  financial  and  operational  management  of  assets,  and \nappropriate  opportunities  for  community  service  obligations.  This  TA  will  provide  capacity \nsupport to the Government in achieving the program objectives in the areas of structural reform \nand improved governance. It will be implemented over a 2-year period and will be followed by \nfurther TA to help sustain the implementation of the IGF beyond the period of the program loan.  \n \n87. \n\nDetails of other development assistance to the Cook Islands are in Appendix 10. \n\nin  support  of \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\n88. \nEconomic.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enable  the  Government  to \nstimulate  the  economy  and  thereby  respond  to  the  economic  downturn  caused  by  the  global \neconomic crisis. It will then support the recovery of the economy and the transition to higher and \nmore-inclusive  economic  growth.  Investment  in  priority  infrastructure  projects  will  deliver  the \nhigher-quality  and  lower-cost  services  needed  for  economic  growth  and  provide  opportunities \nfor local businesses to participate in service delivery. \n \n89. \nSocial. The program will help the Government reduce poverty incidence and bring back \nthe  economy  onto  its  long-run  growth  path.  An  analysis  of  social  and  gender  issues  is  in \nAppendix  8.  Benefits  will  be  accrued  in  the  short term  through  the  mitigation  of  the  negative \neffects of the global economic crisis, and in the medium to long term through the implementation \nof  the  IGF,  which  will  allow  improved  basic  infrastructure  service  delivery  (water,  sanitation, \ntelecommunications,  transport,  roads,  and  power).  Improved  water  and  sanitation  will  deliver \nhealth benefits through lower risk of infection from contaminated water supplies and untreated \nor poorly managed waste. The transport improvements will provide social benefits of improved \naccessibility  and  transport  safety.  In  the  medium  term,  the  IGF  will  also  generate  benefits \nthrough introduction of an equitable system of user charges for infrastructure that protects the \nvulnerable.  This  will  avoid  costs  being  unfairly  borne  by  those  who  do  not  benefit  from  the \nservices  while  providing  safeguards  for  the  vulnerable  users.  The  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nEnvironmental. Environmental benefits will arise from implementation of the IGF in the \n90. \nmedium term as this will allow the Government to optimize the contribution of infrastructure to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. Infrastructure investment projects will incorporate improved \npollution  management,  mitigation  of  the  effects  of  climate  change,  energy  efficiency,  and \nsubstitution of petroleum fuels with renewable energy. User charges will lead to more efficient \nand less wasteful resource use. An environmental assessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n91. \nFinancial.  The  program  will  encourage  improved  fiscal  management  and  budgeting \nfocus on priority expenditures. A progressive increase in user charges for infrastructure services \nand  preventative  maintenance  will  remove  unnecessary  costs  from  the  Government  budget. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nImproved cost efficiency in the provision of infrastructure services will give more fiscal space for \nthe Government\u2019s other social and development spending.  \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n92. \nThe risks are as follows: (i) unforeseen technical and legal problems could delay capital \nexpenditure; (ii) the Government may have insufficient capacity to implement the program; (iii) a \nshortfall  in  financing  may  prevent  the  Government  from  optimizing  infrastructure  and \nimplementing policy actions linked to the program; (iv) community support for the Government\u2019s \nactions may be insufficient; and (v) the Government\u2019s commitment to the program could wane in \nthe lead-up to the 2010 election. \n \nThe  first  two  risks  are  to  be  monitored  and  reduced  through  the  provision  of  TA \n93. \n(footnotes  20  and  22).  It  is  recognized  that  although  there  is  commitment  at  a  political  and \ninstitutional level to continuing the implementation of reforms in infrastructure services delivery, \ntechnical  and  managerial  resources  are  in  short  supply.  The  TA  for  infrastructure  services \ndelivery improvement will assist in supplementing  the expertise to implement the IGF over the \nfirst 4 years of implementation (footnote 20). However, there is still a risk that not enough skilled \nstaff  will  be  retained  or  recruited  by  the  line  ministries  and  public  enterprises  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of the changes. To offset this risk, the design of the TA will include (in the second \nstage)  the  development  of  a  program  for  human  resource  development  in  infrastructure \noperations and management. \n \nThe risk of a shortfall in government financing will be managed through the provision of \n94. \nTA \n(footnote  22).  The  operation  of  effective \ncommunication  programs  is  to  be  imbedded  within  the  program  to  encourage  broad-based \ncommunity support for the Government\u2019s response to the global economic crisis, and actions to \nrevitalize the economy. The Government\u2019s commitment is to be reevaluated after the late-2010 \nelection as part of the formulation of subprogram 2. \n \n95. \nThe ERSP relies on (i) a positive response by the private sector to improved economic \nconditions; (ii) government agencies\u2019 commitment to improved performance; and (iii) restraint by \ngovernment agencies in increasing current expenditure, given their weak revenue performance. \n \n96. \nOverall, the potential benefits from reducing the impact of the global economic crisis and \nproviding  improved  basic  infrastructure  services  with  supporting  structural  and  governance \ninitiatives  are  considered  to  outweigh  the  risks.  Indeed,  the  costs  of  no  action  could  be \nsubstantial. They would be reflected in a continued decline in basic infrastructure services with \nresultant negative effects on health and the environment, and constraints on the private sector. \n \n\nimproved  economic  management \n\nfor \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n97. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  policies  already  adopted  and  actions \nalready taken as described in the development policy letter, including the policy \nthe  program  period  and \nmatrix,  continue \n\nthe  duration  of \n\nin  effect \n\nfor \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsubsequently; and (b) promptly adopt all other policies and take all other actions \nindicated in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure \nthat such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program \nperiod and subsequently. \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral aid partners that have implications for the implementation \nof  the  program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. The Government will continue policy dialogue with ADB on problems \nand  constraints  encountered  during  the  implementation  of  the  program  and  on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n\nThroughout the implementation of the program, the Government will ensure that \nadequate  resources  are  allocated  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  in  order  to \nensure the proper implementation of the ERSP as described in the development \npolicy letter. \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free  environment;  ensure  that  its  anticorruption  law  and  regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced \nand  complied  with  during  the  program  implementation;  and  facilitate  ADB\u2019s \nexercise  of  its  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a \nperformance  evaluation  system  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  established  and \nmaintained; and (b) MFEM monitors and reports to ADB, semiannually over the \nterm  of  the  program,  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  their  impact  on \nbudget  outcomes  and  public  enterprise  performance  (including  financial  and \nperformance  indicators),  as  aligned  with  the  program  impact  and  outcome \nindicators agreed on with the Government. \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that (a) its monitoring and evaluation of the program \nremains  in  effect  for  at  least  1  year  after  the  completion  of  the  program;  and \n(b) within 1 year of program completion, the Government will prepare a program \ncompletion report for the purposes of evaluating the program\u2019s overall success. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  Government  has  satisfactorily  fulfilled  all  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  first \n\n98. \ntranche. \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \n\n99. \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nthe  program  cluster  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  the  Economic  Recovery  Support \nProgram;

 achieved  6  consecutive  years  of  growth  to  2004  as  it \n1. \nrecovered from the economic crisis of the mid-1990s. Economic reforms adopted in response to \nthe  crisis  provided  the  catalyst  to  growth  by  setting  the  foundation  for  a  robust  expansion  in \nprivate sector activity. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.0% yearly on average \nfrom the turnaround in economic performance to 2004, above the long-run yearly growth rate of \n3.5%. \n \n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013supported  Economic  Reconstruction  Program  in \nthe mid-1990s was aimed at improving public sector institutional capacity and creating a more \ncompetitive economy under the leadership of a growth-oriented, productive private sector.2 The \nprogram was largely successful. This is evident in the good rates of private sector\u2013led economic \ngrowth,  a  large  fall  in  unemployment  to  low  rates,  and  the  business  community\u2019s  reasonably \nfavorable assessments of the operating environment. Key achievements were the (i) reduction \nin excess employment in the public service and an associated correction of public servant pay \nrates,  (ii)  reduced  involvement  of  the  public  sector  in  business  activities,  (iii)  adoption  of  a \nmodern  tax  system  centered  on  the  value-added  tax  and  the  reform  of  import  duties, \n(iv) strengthening  of  the  financial  system  through  reform  of  the  state  bank  and  improved \nsupervision, and (v) a more open stance toward foreign investment and workers. \n \nTourism  now  leads  the  Cook  Islands  economy  and  the  structural  transformation  to  a \n3. \nservice-oriented economy is largely complete. Visitor arrivals have grown from less than 50,000 \npeople  in  the  mid-1990s  to  almost  100,000,  compared  with  a  resident  population  of  around \n15,000.  Tourism  growth  has  led  a  more  general  expansion  encompassing  the  wholesale  and \nretail trade, restaurants and accommodation, and transport and communications. However, this \nlack of economic diversification carries significant risks. \n \n4. \nThe  risk  was  highlighted  in  2005.  Damage  from  cyclone  Hera  and  the  disruption  it \ncaused  to  tourism  saw  the  economic  recovery  end  in  2005.  Real  GDP  grew  by  an  estimated \n1.1%  in  2008,  following  growth  of  1.4%  in  2007  and  only  0.7%  in  2006.  The  weaker  growth \nperformance  appears  to  be  linked  as  well  to  insufficient  progress  in  deepening  economic \nreforms.  Productivity  growth  and  the  accumulation  of  physical  and  human  capital  appear  to \nhave  fallen  short  of  that  needed  to  sustain  the  growth  momentum.  The  accumulation  of \nproductive  capital  appears  to  have  been  slowed  by  tighter  restrictions  on  foreign  investment, \nlargely  implemented  through  indirect  means  that  lack  transparency  and  certainty.  The  local \nlabor  supply  is  close  to  fully  employed,  and  imported  labor  is  required  to  meet  demand  and \navoid  a  rising  cost  structure.  However,  concerns  regarding  the  potential  dilution  of  the  Cook \n                                                 \n1  The  sector  diagnostics  presented  in  this  appendix  draw  heavily  on  ADB.  2008.

Business lending \nhas been concentrated in hotels and motels. Commercial bank lending to hotels and motels was \n5% of GDP in 1996, had risen to 9% by 2000, and was 23% by 2005.  \n \n6. \nTwo  branches  of  major  Australian  banks,  Westpac  and  ANZ,  account  for  over  90%  of \nloans (Westpac is by far the largest). The third bank, the state-owned Bank of Cook Islands, has \nimproved  operations  but  continues  to  struggle  with  very-limited  access  to  deposits  and  loan \nfunds.  \n \n7. \nBoth  Australian  branches  have  borrowed  overseas  to  supplement  domestic  funds  to \nmeet credit demand. Interest rate spreads are notably higher than Australian levels (of around \n3%\u20134%). Commercial loans, especially in tourism and related services, represent a major share \nof both branches\u2019 loan books, as do housing loans, the main area of recent growth. Commercial \nloans are short term (below 10 years) and usually secured against land (lease) collateral. The \ncollateral and legal foreclosure processes appear to work satisfactorily and have not hampered \nbank lending. The share of nonperforming loans held by banks is less than 5%.  \n \nBanking  soundness  is  enhanced  by  having  the  two  foreign  branches  prudentially \n8. \nsupervised  by  the  Australian  Prudential  Regulatory  Authority  and  also  by  the  Cook  Islands\u2019 \nFinancial  Supervisory  Commission,  which  also  supervises  the  Bank  of  Cook  Islands.  Banks, \nincluding  foreign  branches,  must  be  licensed  by  the  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  to \noperate in the Cook Islands to ensure prudential soundness in accordance with the Basel core \nprinciples on banking supervision. The number of licenses is not fixed, and entry to banking is \nopen to any applicant that meets the prudential requirements. \n \nThe Bank of Cook Islands began operations on July 2001 through a restructured merger \n9. \nof the Cook Islands Savings Bank and the Cook Islands Development Bank, which had suffered \nlarge losses on development loans to the pearling industry. The Bank of Cook Islands currently \noperates  as  a  retail  commercial  bank,  focusing  on  smaller  domestic  investors.  It  is  free  from \ngovernment interference in its operations, and a good level of transparency and accountability is \nin place. Nevertheless, the bank is struggling to make a profit. \n \n10. \nIt is uncertain whether the banking market is large enough to sustain three commercial \nbanks  in  the  long  term,  and  the  small  market  share  of  the  Bank  of  Cook  Islands  means  it  is \nunlikely  to  provide  any  additional  competitive  pressures  for  the  two  major  banks.  Government \ninvolvement in such a commercial activity carries risk, including the potential for state favoritism \nand a breakdown in corporate governance. Thus, although not a high priority, the Government \ncould consider divesting its ownership of Bank of Cook Islands, and using the funds to finance \nalternative public investments that would contribute more to national welfare.  \n \n11. \nindependent monetary policy.  \n\nAs  the  Cook  Islands  currency  is  the  New  Zealand  dollar,  there  is  no  potential  for  an \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\nC. \n\nMeasures to Sustain Economic Growth \n\n12. \nTourism  is  likely  to  remain  the  driver  of  economic  growth,  concentrated  on  Rarotonga \nand Aitutaki. Land suitable for agriculture exists on Rarotonga and the southern group of outer \nislands,  but  experience  suggests  that  the  economy\u2019s  strengths  are  elsewhere  and  agricultural \nactivity  will  be  limited  to  the  sale  of  fresh  fruit  and  vegetables  to  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  and \nsmall  niche-market  opportunities  (e.g.,  sales  to  Honolulu  of  maire,  from  whose  leaves  are \nfashioned  garlands,  and  coffee  exports  from  Atiu).  A  key  factor  is  the  regionally  high  cost  of \nlabor  and  the  availability  of  more-attractive  employment  alternatives  (e.g.,  in  tourism  or  the \npublic sector). \n \nPearl  farming  on  Manihiki  will  continue  to  be  the  main  private  sector  activity  in  the \n13. \nremote northern group of outer islands, provided that farm management issues are addressed \nand  world  prices  are  favorable.  Other  potential  contributors  to  private  sector  activity  in  the \nnorthern  group  include  offshore  fishing  and  fish  processing,  and  handicrafts.  But  the  scale  of \nthese  activities  is  likely  to  stay  relatively  small.  Public  sector  employment  will  remain  the \ndominant source of income and jobs in the northern group, and in the southern group (excluding \nAitutaki). \n \n14. \nRaising  the  productivity  of  infrastructure  is  an  important  step  toward  sustaining  overall \neconomic growth. The tight fiscal management necessary to correct the Cook Islands\u2019 very high \ndebt levels and the absence of a clear planning framework for infrastructure have contributed to \na  backlog  of  investment.  Roads,  water,  sewerage,  electricity,  and  harbors  and  ports  on \nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki  are  potential  constraints  on  growth  over  the  medium  term.  Existing \ninfrastructure tends to impose unnecessarily high costs on users and in some cases is unable to \nmeet  new  demands  at  a  reasonable  cost  or  standard  (e.g.,  water  on  Aitutaki  or  liquid  waste \ndisposal on Rarotonga).  \n \n15. \nA number of structural barriers in the economy have the potential to become significant \nconstraints on growth. Most import duties were removed with the fiscal year FY2007 budget, but \nsome  were  retained.  Protective  import  tariffs  were  retained  on  most  goods  that  are  also \nproduced locally in an attempt to reduce the competitiveness of imports and hence support local \nproducers, especially in agriculture and drink manufacture. The difficulty is that these protective \ntariffs  feed  into  the  cost  structure  of  the  tourism  industry  and  reduce  its  competitiveness. \nFurthermore, they tend to lock scarce local labor and capital into areas of the economy with low \nproductivity  and  questionable  long-term  prospects.  It  would  be  better  for  the  country  if  such \nprotective tariffs were removed or at least phased out to allow resources to move to their most \nproductive use. Some tariffs on inputs to production, such as those on vehicles, have been kept \nto boost revenue and they also tend to reduce the economy\u2019s competitiveness. \n \n16. \nAn extensive regime of price controls covers most basic food items and fuel. The intent \nis  to  keep  key  items  affordable.  These  controls  can,  however,  force  overall  prices  up  (and \nindications  exist  that  they  do),  and  they  tend  to  shift  profit  margins  from  one  item  to  another \nrather  than  actually  reducing  the  overall  cost  of  consumer  items.  From  a  public  policy \nperspective, price controls can be justified only when effective competition is lacking. Few if any \nof the items currently controlled meet this criterion, at least on Rarotonga and probably also on \nthe outer islands. A better way to keep goods affordable is to provide for a competitive business \nenvironment. Effective competition can be relied on to minimize costs to society, but the current \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nadministrative  mechanisms  inevitably  impose  additional  burdens  on  society  through  market \ndistortions and administrative costs.  \n \n17. \nThe  tendency  to  overregulate  prices  notwithstanding,  one  key  area  of  the  economy \ngenuinely needs better price supervision. Telecom Cook Islands has a monopoly and for many \nyears  has  earned  very  high  profits  by  overcharging.  Such  monopolistic  behavior  reduces  the \neconomy\u2019s  competitiveness  and  has  adverse  social  effects,  not  least  worsening  the  country\u2019s \nremoteness.  An  agreement  with  the  Government  providing  key  monopoly  rights  to  Telecom \nCook Islands has recently expired, but remains in place via legislative restrictions. While prices \nfor  certain  international  services  have  been  reduced  in  recent  years,  it  remains  important  that \nregulatory  changes  be  pursued  to  facilitate  the  entry  of  new  suppliers  so  as  to  remove  any \nremaining  overcharging.  Similar  changes  are  warranted  in  electricity  supply,  though  the \npotential benefits are not as great as in telecommunications. \n \n18. \nThe  education  and  training  sector  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  maintaining  growth. \nLocal labor is in short supply, and this imposes a potential constraint on growth. Adult education \nand  further  improvements  in  educational  standards  have  the  potential  to  lift  labor  productivity \nand underpin a move to higher-valued activities (e.g., in tourism). Better education and training \ncan  also  contribute  to  growth  by  helping  to  keep  residents  in  the  Cook  Islands  so  they  are \navailable to meet the needs of the labor market. Education is particularly important for ensuring \nthe  mobility  of  outer  islanders  and  their  ability  to  gain  access  to  the  better  services  and \nopportunities offered by the main centers. \n \n19. \nOther efforts are required if economic growth is to return to moderate levels. The initial \npriorities for the economy are to follow through on plans to contract out the operation of the fuel \ntank farms that the Government is planning to buy and to make government subsidies open to \ncompetitive  bidding  from  alternative  service  providers,  so  as  to  maximize  the  value  for  money \nthey  generate.  Over  time,  it  will  be  important  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  public  service  and  the \noverall cost of government, to privatize state enterprises, and to improve tourism infrastructure \non Rarotonga and Aitutaki. \n\nD. \n\nLinks to the Sustainability of Communities \n\n20. \nPerhaps  the  biggest  current  development  challenge  is  a  long-term  decline  in  the \npopulation of indigenous Cook Islanders, from around 21,000 in 1971 to the current estimate of \naround  15,000.  Those  holding  Cook  Island  residency  also  hold  New  Zealand  citizenship  and \nhave free access to the New Zealand and Australian job markets and the New Zealand health, \neducation,  and  social  security  systems.  More  than  three  times  as  many  Cook  Islanders  live \noverseas than in the Cook Islands. The predominant migration flows have been from the outer \nislands  to  Rarotonga,  and  from  Rarotonga  to  New  Zealand  and  beyond.  Standards  of  social \nservices,  notably  education,  are  generally  believed  to  be  important  determinants  of  migration, \nand  migration  has  also  responded  to  variations  in  the  economic  fortunes  of  the  Cook  Islands. \nEconomic  management  and  social  service  delivery  therefore  have  important  contributions  to \nmake in sustaining the population and identity of Cook Islanders.  \n \n21. \nin  generating \nprivate sector\u2013led growth only on Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Elsewhere the private sector has not \nresponded  or,  perhaps  more  correctly,  has  been  unable  to  respond  to  the  new  business \nenvironment. In general, the main impact of the mid-1990s reform on the outer islands was an \nexodus of people. There was no offsetting gain in economic sustainability, as the public sector \n\nits  overall  success,  economic \n\nreform  has  succeeded \n\nDespite \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\ncontinues to dominate island economies and crowds out prospects of sustainable private sector \nactivity.  This  crowding-out  effect  has  grown  since  the  reform,  not  eased.  Public  sector  and \nsocial  security  payments  funded  by  the  Government  are  now  the  predominant  source  of \neconomic  activity  in  most  outer  islands.  Some  outer  islands  will  soon  face  the  prospect  of  an \nintractable economic dependency, while others appear to have already reached such a state.  \n\nE. \n\nFinding Balance in Foreign Involvement in the Economy \n\nThe makeup of the country is changing as the number of foreign workers and investors \n22. \nrise, people of Cook Islands descent continue to depart, and fertility rates decline. The foreign, \nnon-tourist population was estimated at 1,000 through the 1990s. Official estimates now put this \npopulation  at  7,000,  or  around  30%  of  the  total  population.  While  these  estimates  probably \noverstate  the  foreign  presence  (it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  returning  Cook  Islanders  from  other \narrivals,  and  many  returnees  are  probably  included  in  the  official  estimates  of  foreigners),  the \nforeign presence is clearly significant and rising.  \n \nSome community members are concerned about the follow-on effects of a rising foreign \n23. \npresence,  including  the  potential  erosion  of  the  Cook  Islands  identity.  This  has  a  social \ndimension, as the culture is seen to be at risk. It is also seen to have a commercial dimension, \nreflecting  concerns  that  the  tourism  industry  may  suffer  if  the  easygoing  lifestyle  and \nCook Islands face of the industry is lost. Some foresee that Rarotonga and Aitutaki may evolve \ninto high-density tourism destinations with little involvement with, or connection to, Cook Island \nMaoris other than by way of rental payments on leased land. \n \n24. \nPublic policy could respond to these issues in a range of ways. At one extreme is a ban \non  further  foreign  involvement,  and  at  the  other  extreme  is  the  free  flow  of  foreign  labor  and \ninvestment. The first extreme would probably see economic growth stall, as there would be no \nadditional  labor  to  meet  growing  demand.  It  would  also  carry  the  risk  of  the  Cook  Islands \neconomy  losing  its  competitiveness  and  actually  contracting  if  local  labor  were  too  forceful  in \ntaking advantage of the opportunity created to push up pay rates. The opposite extreme would \nminimize  the  economy\u2019s  cost  structure  by  tending  to  keep  wages  down.  That  would  probably \nmaximize  economic  growth  but  could  also  bring  very  large  changes  in the  nature  of  the  Cook \nIslands as the foreign presence grows, especially if Cook Islanders continue to leave for better \nwages overseas.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  current  approach  is  a  middle  path.  Foreign  workers  are  allowed \n25. \nwhere  local  skills  are  not  available,  and  foreign  investment  is  allowed  outside  reserve  activity \nareas (and also within them under certain conditions). Foreign workers and investors both pay \nfees,  which  lightly  control  entry.  The  guiding  policy  framework  however  lacks  clarity  and \ncoordination, and this can give rise to uncertainty and inconsistencies.  \n \n26. \nEfficiency,  accountability,  and  transparency  would  be  improved  by  a  more  open  and \nclearly  defined  system.  Support  for  local  labor  and  business  owners  to  upgrade  their  skills  so \nthey  can  play  a  more  prominent  role  in  the  economy  is  probably  also  important  in  finding \nbalance  on  this  issue.  Tightening  current  controls  on  foreign  involvement  (a  proposal  that  is \nalready  well  advanced)  could  be  achieved  through  a  variety  of  means.  Higher  fees  are  one \noption for limiting access. Quotas could be set for foreign labor, or partial bans could be applied \n(e.g., for certain skills, industries, or islands). Some options are better than others, so potential \nimpact should be analyzed and discussed openly.  \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFISCAL ANALYSIS1 \n\nA. \n\nThe Overall Fiscal Stance \n\nGood  economic  growth  combined  with  improved  tax  administration  provided  for \n1. \nsubstantial growth in the real (absolute) value of revenue following the reform of the mid-1990s. \nThe  ratio  of  internal  revenue  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  been  relatively  steady  at \nslightly above 30%. Foreign aid has been relatively high, ranging from 5% to 10% of GDP. Total \nrevenue collections have thus typically been around 40% of GDP, giving rise to a relatively large \ngovernment by international standards. \n \n2. \nExpenditure  has  nonetheless  been  kept  within  the  revenue  envelope.  Operating \nsurpluses of up to 5% of GDP were achieved until FY2008. This provided the Government with \ngood financial capacity to either fund investment or run overall budget surpluses. In the event, \ncapital  expenditure  was  restrained  and  the  overall  budget  was  in  surplus  until  FY2006  and  in \nnear balance in FY2007, and there was only a small overall deficit in FY2008. \n \n3. \nGovernment  debt  had  reached  extraordinarily  high  levels  over  the  1990s  because  of \npoor  management  of  the  Government\u2019s  involvement  in  commercial  activities  and  high  budget \ndeficits.  Debt  peaked  at  141%  of  GDP  before  a  debt  restructuring  facilitated  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  known  as  the  Manila  Agreement,  cut  debt  by  around  half.  The \nbudget  surpluses,  the  appreciation  of  the  New  Zealand  dollar,  and  a  further  write-down  in  the \ndebt in 2004 (by the Government of France) and in 2006 (by the Government of Italy) reduced \ngross general government debt to 16.8% of GDP by FY2008. Once government cash reserves \nbuilt up to cover future loan obligations were taken into account, the net outstanding debt was \nonly 2.2% of GDP. \n \n4. \nThe gross debt ratios are based on the book value of debt. Nearly all of the current debt \nis external debt secured on concessionary terms from ADB. Moreover, the net present value of \nthe gross debt, which determines the effective value of the debt, is much lower than the gross \ndebt. Hence, prudent fiscal management had transformed the general government sector from a \nposition of extreme debt to one of being close to debt free. \n \n5. \nThe  tight  fiscal  position  required  post-reform  was,  however,  at  the  expense  of  the \ncountry\u2019s physical infrastructure. A backlog of investment has accumulated in the area of roads, \nports  and  harbors,  electricity,  water,  liquid  and  solid  waste  management,  telecommunications, \nand  government  buildings.  Nonfinancial  factors  have  also  contributed  to  the  backlog  of \ninvestment. The Government\u2019s strong financial position means it is now well placed to address \nthe backlog of investment. The improved financial capacity is timely, as the economic expansion \nhas led to bottlenecks in the infrastructure network, and these place growth and public safety at \nrisk.  \n \n6. \nThe FY2009 budget signaled a move to a more expansionary fiscal stance. Although the \nfiscal expansion was primarily due to rising capital expenditure, there was also some relaxation \nin  current  expenditure.  Notably,  subsidies  to  business  were  increased  and  the  hosting  of  the \nPacific  Mini-Games  in  late  2009  carried  with  it  a  substantial  operating  expense,  which \ncollectively saw the operating balance move to deficit in FY2009.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The  sector  diagnostics  presented  in  this  appendix  draw  heavily  on  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n41\n\nB. \n\nThe Quality of the Revenue System \n\n7. \nGood progress was made on the revenue side of the budget, with the tax and customs \nsystem modernized during the economic reform. The tax system is centered on a progressive \nincome tax and flat-rate value-added tax. Tax rates have been kept reasonable and stable, and \nattention  has  been  paid  to  maintaining  the  simplicity  of  the  system.  The  improved  design \ncorrected  for  many  inefficiencies  and  inequities  in  the  revenue  system.  Further,  over  time \nadministration  and  compliance  have  been  improved  to  lift  the  performance  of  the  tax  and \ncustoms system. \n \n8. \nbe improved, notably through the following: \n\nThere are nevertheless some areas where the performance of the revenue system could \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  (phased)  removal  of  the  remaining  protective  tariffs,  mainly  because  of  the \ninefficiencies they impose on the economy. \nThe  early  removal  of  the  high  tax  rates  that  apply  to  second  jobs.  The high  tax \nrates are inequitable, as people on the same income can pay different levels of \ntax  depending  on  whether  they  have  one  or  more  jobs  (an  equitable  outcome \nwould be one where they pay equal taxes). The high tax rates are also inefficient, \nas they adversely affect the incentive to work. \nThe  adoption  over  the medium  term  of  a  capital  gains  tax  and  a  fringe  benefits \ntax. Better-performing tax systems include all sources of income in the definition \nof taxable income.  \nGreater  reliance  on  user  charges,  subject  to  equity  concerns  being  addressed \n(e.g.,  through  concessions  for  the  disadvantaged).  There  is  very  little  user \ncharging for government services (e.g., public health and education are provided \nfree of charge), and where charges are levied (e.g., most infrastructure services) \nthey tend to be less than operating costs. \nIncreased returns from some underperforming public enterprises. \n\nC. \n\nThe Quality of Public Expenditure \n\nImportant progress has also been made in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \n9. \npublic  expenditure.  The  annual  budget  process  requires  ministries  to  prepare  budget \nsubmissions that are scrutinized for potential improvements by the cabinet and the Ministry of \nFinance  and  Economic  Management  (MFEM),  and  efforts  are  being  made  to  raise  the \nsophistication  of  the  process  as  the  capacity  of  agencies  allows.  This  capacity  has  been  built \nthrough  the  modernization  of  the  financial  management  system,  improvements  in  corporate \nplanning overseen by the Public Service Commission, and attention to staff training.  \n \nThe formation of a Budget Committee of outside parties to engage in the budget process \n10. \nhas  emerged  as  an  important  initiative.  The  reports  of  the  committee  are  notable  for  their \nvigorous analysis of agency budgets and performance, and they have considerable standing in \nthe  process  and  the  cabinet\u2019s  final  consideration  of  the  proposed  budget.  Efficiency  and \neffectiveness  is  also  assisted  by  the  practice  of  conducting  publicly  available,  special-purpose \nreviews of key issues, recent examples being of outer-island funding, health management, and \nthe funding and operations of the police force. \n \nThe  budget  process  is  greatly  strengthened  by  the  activities  of  the  Public  Expenditure \n11. \nReview  Committee  and  Audit,  which  has  a  solid  record  of  providing  forthright,  detailed \nassessments of the use of public funds, and has been prepared to identify publicly inappropriate \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\npractices at the most senior levels of the Government and the community. Areas subject to its \nreview include the actions of ministers, the accounts of ministries, the sale and attempted sale \nof  government  assets,  and  development  partner  projects.  The  key  limitations  of  the  audit \nprocess have been the 2- to 3-year gap in the complete submission of public accounts for audit, \nas  this  can  delay  the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit\u2019s  work  until  well  after \nevents  have  taken  place,  and  the  discretion  provided  to  Parliament  as  to  when  the  Public \nExpenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit\u2019s  reports  are  tabled  or  responded  to.  Actions  to \nimprove financial management systems are scheduled to reduce the gap in submission of public \naccounts  to  less  than  1  year  soon.  The  volume  and  standard  of  public  disclosure  achieved \nthrough  the  Cook  Islands\u2019  audit  function  is  probably  now  the  highest  among  the  Pacific  island \ncountries and approaching that achievable by the country\u2019s larger neighbors.  \n \n12. \nThe need to now increase public investment to sustain growth and achieve ecologically \nsustainable  development  poses  a  new  challenge.  Ensuring  high  quality  in  capital  spending \nremains  an  issue  and  requires  that  government  agencies  follow  a  transparent  and  robust \nprocess of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, funding, and implementing investment projects. It \nis essential that projects have clear social and economic benefits and achieve a satisfactory rate \nof  return,  particularly  where  financed  from  loan  funds.  Projects  that  are  self-funding  from  a \nrevenue  stream  or  that  result  in  savings  in  maintenance  and  operating  cost  that  outweigh  the \ncost of the capital investment are preferred from a fiscal perspective. \n \n13. \n\nOther key issues to be faced in refining public expenditure are:  \n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nis \n\nrising \n\nfacing \n\nthe  challenge  of  a \n\nSector priorities. For the Cook Islands, the economic priorities are likely to lie in \neconomic infrastructure, education, and health. A backlog of infrastructure needs \nto be addressed, there is considerable potential to raise education standards and \ndoing so is important to satisfying the human capital needs of the economy, and \nthe  health  system \nincidence  of \nnoncommunicable diseases. \nThe  wage  bill.  There  has  been  considerable  growth  in  the  number  of  public \nsector employees since the cuts of the mid-1990s. There were 3,200 employees \nin  early  1996.  Numbers  had  been  cut  to  1,500  by  early  1997,  but  have  since \nrisen to around 2,000. MFEM has recognized that the expenditure on the wage \nbill  was  tending  to  suppress  funding  for  capital  goods  and  services,  and  hence \nthe funding needed for the delivery of government services. \nInequities  between  islands.  There  is  considerable  variation  across  islands  in \nfunding for essential services. For example, in total funding for outer-island staff \ncosts for education and health, and the island administration (which is largely for \nthe  operation  of  infrastructure),  varied  from  NZ$1,050  per  person  on  Aitutaki  to \nNZ$4,600 per person on Rakahanga in FY2007. The average per person for the \nouter islands was of the order of double the allocation to Rarotonga. There is no \nobvious public policy rationale for these variations in funding. \n\nD. \n\nDebt Sustainability \n\n14. \nThe achievement of a sustainable debt position has been one of the key results of the \neconomic reform. The fiscal transformation was guided by the principles of fiscal responsibility \nestablished under the MFEM Act and financial ratios established under the Manila Agreement. \nUnder  the  Manila  Agreement,  the  Government  made  a  commitment:  (i) not  to  undertake  new \ncommercial  borrowings  for  7  years;  (ii) that  key  financial  ratios  (in  relation  to  debt,  wages  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n43\n\nsalaries and recurrent expenditure on goods and services) would not exceed their levels as of \nthe end of 2001\u201302; (iii) that the operating budget balance would remain in surplus; and (iv) that \nborrowing  by  state-owned  enterprises  would  be  limited  to  activities  that  generate  enough \nadditional revenue to service the debt. \n \nUnder  current  expenditure  plans,  the  net  public  debt  of  the  general  government  sector \n15. \nwould  rise  rapidly  to  the  order  of  25%  of  GDP  (all  of  it  external).  Net  debt  would,  however, \nremain within prudent threshold levels. For example, the net debt ratio would be well below the \n50% debt-to-GDP threshold set for a well-performing low-income economy. The projected debt \nposition also compares favorably with debt thresholds based on comparisons with exports and \ngovernment revenue. \n \n16. \nDebt accumulation can be thought of as sustainable if interest and principal repayments \ncan  be  met  by  a  borrower  without  an  unrealistically  large  future  correction  in  the  balance  of \nincome  and  expenditure.2  Judged  on  this  basis,  the  fiscal  position  is  sustainable.  Long-term \nrevenue  prospects  are  sound,  provided  prudent  public  investments  are  made  to  relieve  the \ninfrastructure constraint on economic growth. There are also a number of other sensible options \nfor accommodating the projected rise in debt servicing costs of the general government sector. \nMoreover,  important  safeguards  are  included  in  the  finance  legislation,  and  there  is  a  good \nrecord of compliance with such safeguards. \n \n17. \nThis  conclusion  is  reached  subject  to  the  proviso  that  debt  is  secured  for  well-planned \nand  justified  capital  expenditure,  and  that  public  enterprise  debt  is,  as  planned,  funded \nindependently of the budget (excepting justified community service obligations).  \n \n18. \nIn  interpreting  these  findings,  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  Cook  Islands  is \nvulnerable  to  natural  disaster  and  adverse  economic  developments.  This  vulnerability  means \nthat  the  Cook  Islands  should  aim  for  a  lower  debt  level  than  normal  so  as  to  provide  a  buffer \nagainst  shocks  (to  retain  the  capacity  to  borrow  in  adverse  circumstances).  This  observation, \ncombined  with  the  need  to  retain  the  fiscal  capacity  to  complete  the  planned  infrastructure \nupgrade, suggests that the accumulation of public debt now under way should be approached \ncarefully. \n \n19. \nThe  fiscal  improvements  saw  a  progressive  upgrade  from  1998  in  the  credit  rating \nissued by Standard & Poor\u2019s. On 11 August 2009, Standard & Poor\u2019s revised its outlook on the \nCook  Islands  to  negative  from  stable,  while  reaffirming  its  BB/B  foreign  currency  and  local \ncurrency  credit  ratings  on  the  sovereign.3  The  updated  rating  took  into  account  the  FY2010 \nbudget  and  projections  of  an  increase  in  net  debt  to  an  estimated  28%  of  GDP.  Standard  & \nPoor\u2019s  noted  that  the  projected  increase  in  debt  would  be  temporary,  and  reflect  the  bringing \nforward  of  some  port,  water,  and  road  infrastructure  projects  to  benefit  from  concessionary \nterms  available  from  development  partners  and  to  address  infrastructure  shortcomings  that \nimpair investment in tourism and allied sectors, which are needed to diversify the economy and \nprovide employment opportunities for the population.4 \n\n                                                 \n2  International  Monetary  Fund.  2002.

The  community  demands  higher  service  standards,  higher  incomes,  and  more \nopportunities. The aspiration appears to be to reach New Zealand standards, while at the same \ntime preserving the Cook Islands lifestyle, as modernized on Rarotonga and maintained in more \ntraditional style on the outer islands. At the same time, a declining share of government revenue \nto gross domestic product requires tighter prioritization of government expenditure.  \n \n2. \nPublic  sector  management  rests  on  four  pieces  of  legislation  enacted  as  part  of  the \neconomic reform. These are the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) Act, \n1996;  the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit  (PERCA)  Act,  1996;  the  Public \nService Act, 1996; and the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act, 1998.  \n \nThe  MFEM  Act  provides  for  detailed  annual  statements  of  the  Government\u2019s  financial \n3. \nposition  and  its  activities  according  to  modern  principles  of  budgeting,  and  more  frequent \nupdates  of  economic  and  financial  conditions.  The  PERCA  Act  provides  a  safeguard  against \nfinancial  impropriety  through  its  financial  audits  of  government  accounts  and  special-purpose \nreviews  of  the  use  of  public  funds.  The  heads  of  ministries  operate  under  performance-based \ncontracts overseen by the public service commissioner, who also has a role in establishing and \noverseeing  the  public  service.  And  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  has  been \nestablished with responsibility for the overall management of public enterprises and other public \nassets. \n \n4. \nThe main achievement of the modern management system established under this suite \nof  legislation  has  been  a  substantial  improvement  in  the  quality  of  financial  management: \ninternal  management  reports  are  prepared  regularly;  almost  all  expenditure  is  on-budget;  all \nassets  and  liabilities  (including  contingent  liabilities)  are  identified;  there  is  a  good  public \ndisclosure of the financial position; audits are timely and most concerns raised are minor; and \nexpenditure is generally in line with approved funding. The improvements have been achieved \nacross  the  public  sector,  including  the  public  enterprises.  In  stark  contrast  to  the  situation \n15 years  ago,  the  Government  now  has  in  place  one  of  the  foundations  required  for  effective \nand efficient management of public resources.  \n \n5. \nThe  progress  that  has  been  made  is  most  readily  evidenced  by  the  substantial \nimprovement  in  the  Government\u2019s  financial  position.  The  fiscal  position  was  unsustainable \n10 years ago. By 2008, the Government was almost debt free and there has been a significant \nlowering  of the  tax  burden.  It is  also  evident  in  the  increasing  alignment  and  harmonization  of \ndevelopment partner funds, as initiated by the New Zealand and Australian aid programs, which \nhas resulted in the integration of almost all development partner-funded programs and projects \ninto the budget process. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  sector  diagnostics  presented  in  this  appendix  draw  heavily  on  ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nB. \n\nPriorities \n\n6. \nA  remaining  gap  in  public  sector  management  is  the  establishment  of  a  systematic \nprocess for assessing performance. While the budget sets out a work plan with targeted results \nand  performance  measures  for  the  outputs  of  each  ministry,  they  are  not  scrutinized  in  a \nsystematic  manner.  The  management  system  established  for  ministries  requires  the  Public \nService Commission to regularly review progress in delivering these outputs, but no such review \nis undertaken. Many performance measures are unrealistic\u2014too high to be of use in the annual \nreview.  Heads  of  ministries  are  subject  to  performance  review,  but  without  ministry-level \ninformation the review can be only superficial. This means that the cycle of inputs, activities, and \noutputs  required  to  feed  back  into  reformulation  in  subsequent  years  is  weak  at  best  and,  at \nworst, completely absent.  \n \n7. \nAdopting  a  performance  management  system  would  be  greatly  assisted  by  the \nimplementation of the National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP). The NSDP \nsets out the national vision and goals, as well as the direction to be followed by the lower-level \nplans  (sector  strategies,  corporate  plans,  and  the  annual  budget).  The  plan  presents  an \nimportant  opportunity  to  reinvigorate  the  broader  engagement  of  the  community  in  the  use  of \npublic sector resources. \n \nA further gap is in the integration of the substantial payments on behalf of the Crown and \n8. \naid activities into ministry outputs. While their use is identified in the budget, at present they are \ntreated  as  stand-alone  activities  and  accountability  for  delivery  is  not  defined.  A  complete \nperformance assessment system would build in this accountability link. \n \n9. \nImprovements  can  also  be  made  in  the  mode  of  government  operation.  For  example, \nkey  issues  to  be  faced  in  developing  infrastructure  include  the  process  of  selecting  public \ninvestment,  management  weaknesses  within  agencies,  low-cost  recovery  on  public  services, \nand  problems  faced  in  the  devolution  of  responsibilities  to  island  councils.  The  competitive \noutsourcing of infrastructure to the private sector has the potential to be an important response \nto  these  problems,  requiring  further  rethinking  of  the  division  of  responsibilities  between  the \npublic and private sectors. \n \n10. \nAll  expenditure  decisions  face  the  need  to  establish  realistic  standards  of  services \nacross  the  country.  Improvements  in  services  on  the  outer  islands  inevitably  come  at  the \nexpense  of  improvements  on  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  thereby  accentuating  the  gap  between \nthese  centers\u2019  standards  and  those  of  New  Zealand,  to  which  people  appear  to  aspire.  The \nbigger  the  gap  between  Cook  Islands  and  New  Zealand  standards,  the  larger  the  population \noutflow, which imposes its own costs on the country.  \n \nOther  measures  that  could  support  accountability  and  transparency  include  (i)  making \n11. \nbudget documents more readable; (ii) publicly releasing the reports of the independent budget \ncommittee;  (iii)  reducing  the  use  of  payments  on  behalf  of  the  Crown;  (iv)  adopting  codes  of \nconduct  for  members  of  Parliament,  civil  servants,  and  officers  of  the  public  enterprises;  and \n(v) imposing tighter controls on public enterprises and the appointment of ministry heads to curb \na tendency toward politicization. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n47\n\nC. \n\nComplementary Improvements in Governance \n\nin  1998,  but \n\nthe  Constitution  was  released \n\n12. \nThe quality of governance remains one of the main risks to continued development and \nan  area  warranting  renewed  efforts.  A  key  consideration  is  the  absence  of  action  to  advance \nfew \nconstitutional  reform.  A  review  of \nrecommendations  were  implemented.  There  have  been  frequent  changes  of  government,  and \nthe  associated  political  instability  and  uncertainty  has  probably  undermined  the  quality  of \ngovernment  with  follow-on  effects  on  emigration  and  economic  growth.  Political  patronage \nremains an ongoing risk that has been exaggerated by the (i) weaknesses in the parliamentary \nsystem,  (ii)  the  ability  of  ministers  of  the  Crown  to  act  outside  the  accountability  framework, \n(iii) the absence of a clear planning framework to guide the use of public funds, and (iv) gaps in \nperformance management under the budget process. \n \n13. \nA key component of reforms in the mid-1990s was to be the transfer of formal authority \nto make and implement decisions from the center to the periphery. At the time, and for several \nyears  thereafter,  this  transfer  was  considered  critical  for  the  sustainability  of  the  country. \nSpecifically,  the  Government  was  to  devolve  some  key  resource  management  and  public \nadministrative  control  to  island  councils,  and  to  provide  a  fully  functional  and  effective  form  of \nself-government  for  each  island,  provided  with  clear  and  open  lines  of  responsibility  and \ncommunications  with  the  restructured  central  Government  on  Rarotonga.  The  actual  extent  of \ndevolution fell short of this intention. Lacking the support of a clear policy framework, devolution \noutpaced the development of local capacity from a low base, with the result that the devolution \nthat  did  occur  has  largely  been  reversed.  The  balance  of  power  between  central  and  island \ngovernments  probably  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  quality  of  island  services.  Although \ndevolution  is  a  difficult  area  for  making  progress,  there  is  value  in  revisiting  these  issues  and \nseeking a sustainable approach. \n\nD. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n14. \nThe  Cook  Islands  has  extensive  legislation  in  place  to  prevent  or  address  corruption. \nThis is backed by supportive institutional arrangements for implementation and oversight. This \nsystem provides an example to other Pacific island countries, showing what can be achieved in \na  small  economy.  Cook  Islands  expressed  its  commitment  to  anticorruption  measures  by \nendorsing the Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific of ADB and the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development in 2001.  \n\n \n15. \nAt the same time, Transparency International\u2019s 2004 study of national integrity systems \nin the Cook Islands2 found that, in practice, governance is heavily influenced by the traditional \npractice of respect for elders and leaders, which leads to a reluctance to question their actions. \nThere  appeared  to  be  an  acceptance  that  people  who  misuse,  for  private  benefit,  power \nentrusted  to  them  would  not  be  punished.  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  the  inadequate \ncapacity  of  the  police  force  and  Crown  Law  office,  which  means  a  backlog  of  pending  cases \ncannot  be  prosecuted.  Transparency  International  has  called  for  the  establishment  of  an \nindependent commission on corruption in the Cook Islands to expose and minimize corruption in \nthe public sector and to educate the community on corruption. \n \n16. \nOverall, the judicial system has a reputation for being transparent and competent, with \njudges  (usually  from  New  Zealand)  who  are  of  high  caliber  and  independent,  and  free  from \n                                                 \n2  Transparency  International.  2004.

Of growing concern, however, is the increasing \nuse of justices of the peace to sit on criminal and land cases in an effort to reduce costs. This is \nof  concern  because  the  justices  of  the  peace  are  purportedly  appointed  by  the  Government \nwithout attention to merit and do not necessarily have relevant qualifications or experience. \n \n17. \nThe  PERCA  Act  was  introduced  in  July  1996  to  help  ensure  financial  management \noversight and improve accountability and transparency. As a result of this legislation, the current \nAudit  Office  was  established  and  given  responsibility  for  external  audits.  The  Audit  Office \nfunctions as a safeguard to maintain the financial integrity of the country\u2019s parliamentary system \nof government. It has effective policies and investigative skills, and the standard of auditing has \nimproved in recent years. \n \nThe  Cook  Islands\u2019  audits  of  ministries  and  statutory  authorities  are  mostly  completed \n18. \nwithin 12 months of the end of the financial year\u2014some outsourcing their accounting, and thus \nadvancing the pace of account preparations\u2014and the number of audit qualifications is steadily \nreducing.  Ministries  are  also  recognized  as  being  responsive  to  the  qualifications.  The  Crown \nconsolidation takes longer (around 24 months from the end of the financial year), as it is reliant \non all ministries and statutory authorities\u2019 accounts being audited first. The PERCA Act requires \nthe  use  of  an  audit  adviser,  a  role  taken  on  by  Ernst  &  Young.  The  strengthening  of  audit \ncapacity  is  an  iterative  process,  with  the  recent  adoption  of  a  new  software  system  showing \nproductivity gains in the Audit Office\u2019s operations. Issues highlighted by PERCA have resulted in \ncharges being laid against individuals. \n \n19. \nThe public service is governed by both the Public Service Act and a code of conduct for \nthe  public  service  and  senior  executives.  Merit-based  selection  and  promotion  and  ethical \nstandards  are  commonly  applied  and  public  servants  are  generally  competent.  Some  serious \nchallenges  remain,  however.  For  example,  management  is  now  supposedly  performance \nbased,  but  the  Public  Service  Commission  lacks  the  capacity  to  measure  the  performance  of \nany staff other than heads of agencies at line ministries. Corruption and political nepotism exist, \nwith criminal prosecutions of senior public servants in recent years.  \n \n20. \nThe  Cook  Islands  is  increasingly  receptive  to  transparency  in  information  and  decision \nmaking.  One  innovative  mechanism  used  is  the  budget  committee,  which  involves  parties \nexternal  to  the  public  sector  to  analyze  agency  budgets  and  performance.  The  reports  of  the \nbudget committee have considerable standing in the cabinet\u2019s final decision making. An Official \nInformation Act has recently been put in place and is overseen by the ombudsman\u2019s office. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n49\n\nANALYSIS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nInfrastructure in the National Sustainable Development Plan \n\nThe Cook Islands Government recognized that the mid-1990s reform process, the need \n1. \nfor  fiscal  consolidation,  and  too-frequent  changes  in  government  composition  resulted  in  too \nlittle  attention  being  paid  to  medium-  and  long-term  development  goals.1  To  help  refocus,  the \nGovernment embarked on the preparation of a policy formation and broad consultative process \naimed at preparing the nation\u2019s second development plan. In 2007, the Government adopted Te \nKaveinga Nui, the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP).2  \n \n2. \nThe  NSDP  established  a  national  vision  \u201cto  enjoy  the  highest  quality  of  life  consistent \nwith  the  aspirations  of  our  people,  and  in  harmony  with  our  culture  and  environment.\u201d \nInfrastructure is prominent in the third of the NSDP\u2019s five strategic outcomes: \n\nStrategic Outcome 3: Sustainable Economic Growth in Harmony with our Social Values, \nCulture and Environment \n\nWe envisage that by 2020, our largely private sector-led GDP will reach $0.6 billion \nbased on sustainable development principles.  \n\nWe envisage that by 2020, all islands will have achieved the minimum standards set \nfor basic infrastructure, transport and utilities to support their economic development.  \n\nWe  envisage  by  2020,  there  will  be  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  the  benefits  of \neconomic growth across all islands. \n\n \n3. \nInfrastructure  is  at  the  core  of  the  fifth  of  the  NSDP\u2019s  eight  strategic  goals:  \u201ca  strong \nbasic  infrastructure  base  to  support  national  development.\u201d  Improved  infrastructure  for  water \nsupply  and  waste  disposal  is  also  recognized  by  the  NSDP  as  crucial  to  achievement  of  the \nfourth goal of \u201csustainable use and management of our environment and natural resources.\u201d  \n \n4. \nRecent  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  studies  have  involved  comprehensive  reviews \nof the legislative, institutional, and regulatory frameworks for infrastructure operating within the \nCook Islands.3 The studies show, almost without exception, that recommendations of previous \nstudies  aimed  at  improving  the  efficiency  of  project  implementation  and  service  delivery  have \nnot  been  adopted,  or  have  been  acted  on  in  a  limited  manner.  In  a  number  of  instances, \nimprovements  under  the  respective  project  initiatives  have  faltered  through  a  combination  of \ninadequate  human  and  financial  resources  for  subsequent  operation  and  maintenance. \nCommitments to cost recovery or \u201cuser pay\u201d have also faltered and tended to fall by the wayside \nfor a number of reasons, including inadequate local resources, inadequate technical assistance \n(TA) support and continuity, an absence of political conviction, and concerted public opposition \n(the latter due in part to limited public awareness and engagement). \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila  (TA  4605-COO:  Strengthening  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation \n[Component 2: Preventative Infrastructure Master Plan]) have provided valuable reference points. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThese observations convey an important message for the implementation of the NSDP. \n5. \nThere  is  a  need  for  a  renewed  legislative,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework  that  is \n(i) attuned  to  the  political  environment  of  the  Cook  Islands,  (ii)  culturally  acceptable  to  the \ncommunity,  and  (iii)  capable  of  being  implemented  with  the  available  human  and  financial \nresources. \n\nB. \n\nAgency Responsibilities \n\nResponsibility for infrastructure planning, provision, and regulation rests with several line \n6. \nministries  and  government  agencies.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  are  fragmented  and  vital \nskills are dispersed among the agencies. Responsibilities in some instances are unclear and are \nassumed and acted on in default by the agencies with the legal responsibility. A general lack of \naccountability for performance coupled with a critical shortage of resources and skills has meant \nthat planning, the development of policy, and forward budgeting and operational programming \nwithin the agencies has been below that required to implement the NSDP. \n \nThe  reforms  of  the  mid-1990s  included  the  placement  of  the  financially  sustainable \n7. \npublic enterprises under the oversight of the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC). This \nincluded the provision of electricity to Rarotonga and the operation of international airports and \nharbors  for  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  Significant  decentralization  of  functions  to  island \nadministrations  occurred  alongside  the  restructuring  and  downsizing  of  the  public  service. \nDifficulties  with  capacity  have  resulted  in  the  recentralization  of  education  and  health  services \nexcept for Palmerston Island, for which all government services are fully devolved. \n \n8. \nThe government reforms of the mid-1990s were also significant in passing responsibility \nfor  the  management,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  all  island  infrastructure  into  the  hands  of \nthe  island  administrations.  A  lack  of  technical  capacity,  funding,  and  regular  maintenance \nresulted in deteriorating outer-island services, a situation that remains a matter of concern.4 The \nOffice of the Minister of Island Administration has adopted the role of facilitating the devolution \nprocess from the central government to the outer islands. It provides support and advice to the \nisland  administrations  on  governance,  financial  management,  infrastructure  development,  and \noperation and maintenance. \n \n9. \nThe  Office  of  the  Minister  of  Island  Administration  continues  to  provide  facilitation  and \nsupport services. Following reform, the office assumed a large measure of responsibility for the \npreparation of financial statements for island administrations, but it has now withdrawn from this \ninvolvement. The agency has a full-time architect on its staff, and since August 2007 a full-time \ncivil engineer; together they provide most technical services within the agency.  \n \nThe in-house technical capacity allows the Office of the Minister of Island Administration \n10. \nto  be  directly  involved  in  advice  and  assistance  for  outer-island  infrastructure.  The  office  has \nalso  overhauled  electrical  generators  for  the  island  administrations  (with  the  exception  of \nAitutaki) at its workshop in the Ministry of Works (MOW) and contracted out the repairs of heavy \nequipment. MOW and the Rarotonga power supplier (Te Aponga Uira) have been called upon to \nprovide support to the island administrations on a fee-for-service basis. The degree of support \nprovided  is  not,  however,  clear  and  may  have  been  minor.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Grant to the \nCook Islands for the Cyclone Emergency Assistance Project. Manila (TA 4605-COO).  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n51\n\nbuilding construction and electrical works on the outer islands has been spasmodic, if at all in \ncase of some islands, giving rise to concerns of public and community safety. \n\nC. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n11. \nConsultations  during  the  preparation  of  the  2007  Preventive  Infrastructure  Master  Plan \nrevealed a widely held belief in both government and civil society that private sector involvement \nshould  be  maximized.  Private  sector  participation  in  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure would be seen as having the potential to increase efficiency and \nlead  to  more  sustainable  levels  of  service.  Some  services  provided  by  government  agencies \nwere subsequently placed with private contractors. Services such as the collection of household \nrefuse, trenching for cables, and trenching for water mains on Rarotonga have been contracted \nout  without  noticeable  adverse  impact.  This  offers  the  benefit  of  allowing  the  Government  to \navoid the need for reinvestment in plant and equipment for these activities. \n \n12. \nConsultation showed a rising acceptance of the value of confining the Government\u2019s role \nin infrastructure to (i) conducting strategic planning and setting policy; (ii) determining affordable \nservice  levels  in  consultation  with  users  of  the  service;  (iii)  establishing  programs  for \ninfrastructure maintenance and operations; and (iv) providing appropriate levels of funding, with \nan increased private sector involvement in service delivery and infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance.  \n \n13. \nDevolution  of  service  delivery  and  the  provision  of  infrastructure  will  require  a  clear \ndefinition of the role of the government agencies as the managers of the Crown\u2019s infrastructure \nassets. It will also require new skills and capacity in asset management and the development of \ngeneral conditions of contract, contract documentation, and specifications for the contracting of \nthe  service delivery  on  an  outcome-based  approach.  Transparent  and appropriate competitive \npricing  procedures  will  also  be  required  to  run  alongside  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  and \ntendering  requirements  outlined  in  its  proposed  Financial  Policies  and  Procedures  Manual. \nLocal contractors will need assistance and training to develop familiarity with and skills for the \nnew  procurement  and  bidding  processes.  Coupled  with  this  will  be  the  need  to  develop \nfor \ncontractor  understanding  of  contractual  obligations,  responsibilities,  and \nperformance-based contract works. \n\nliabilities \n\nD. \n\nInfrastructure Ownership \n\n14. \nThe Cook Islands Act of 1915 and the amendment acts of 1965 and 1966 provide that \nany road in the Cook Islands vested before or after the act shall not as such vest in the Crown, \nbut  shall  belong  in  accordance  with  common  law  to  the  adjoining  owners,  if  no  public \nright-of-way  exists.  Referring  to  the  formation  of  the  roads,  section  609  of  the  act  then  states \nthat all roads in the Cook Islands may be formed, maintained, and repaired by the Crown, and \nshall be deemed to be in the possession of the Crown. \n \n15.  MOW  was  established  originally  as  the  Ministry  of  Supportive  Services  under  the \nSupportive  Services  Act  of  1974  and  later  renamed  under  the  Public  Service  Identification  of \nDepartments  Order  of  2000.  The  Supportive  Services  Act  empowered  the  ministry  to  provide, \nconstruct, and maintain roads; and to establish, provide, and maintain an adequate water supply \nand reticulation service in all the islands. These roles have been limited to Rarotonga following \nthe  devolution  of  responsibilities  to  the  outer  islands.  MOW  also  has  the  right  to  maintain \nforeshores  (defined  as  a  30-meter-wide  strip  of  land  extending  along  and  abutting  the  mean \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nhigh water mark). The Rarotonga Waterworks Ordinance of 1960 and the acts and amendments \nto which it relates provide for the establishment, maintenance, and control of waterworks on the \nisland.  It  prescribes  powers  for  the  minister,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  ordinance  to \nconstruct,  extend,  improve,  and  maintain  waterworks.  In  2008,  in  accordance  with  the \nInfrastructure  Governance  Framework,  MOW  was  merged  with  the  Office  of  the  Minister  of \nIsland Administration to form the Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning.  \n \n16. \nThe  CIIC,  established  under  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act  of  1998 \nadministers  Crown  assets  and  shareholding  interests  and  supervises  the  undertakings  of \nstatutory  corporations.  It  has  assumed  responsibility  for  the  interests  of  the  Cook  Islands \nGovernment Property Corporation. CIIC has a board of three members appointed by its minister \nwith the concurrence of the cabinet, and a chief executive officer appointed by the board. The \nCIIC\u2019s responsibilities cover Te Aponga Uira, the Cook Islands Ports Authority, the Cook Islands \nAirport Authority, and the Cook Islands Government Property Corporation and its subsidiaries. \nThe corporation has responsibility for Crown assets, including infrastructure assets. \n \nCIIC  is  therefore  the  trustee  of  the  Crown  assets  with  responsibility  for  protecting  the \n17. \nCrown\u2019s investment in public infrastructure. Asset ownership is relevant to any requirement for \nasset management plans, and the responsibility for overseeing the plans prepared by the asset \nmanagers  in  the  infrastructure  agencies,  and  for  ensuring  the  plans  remain  meaningful  and \ncurrent. \n \n18. \nThe  CIIC  has  an  office  staff  of  around  12  persons,  and  a  mobile  maintenance  unit  of \naround eight staff comprising a foreman and maintenance crew. The organization structure has \nfour sections: (i) administration, (ii) property management, (iii) finance, and (iv) legal and lands. \nThe  property  management  section  handles  maintenance  and  improvements  in  all  government \nproperty together with the project management of all works and projects. These include the new \nindoor sports stadium being built and funded by the People\u2019s Republic of China, which CIIC was \nrequired to have ready for the South Pacific Mini Games of September 2009.  \n \n19. \nThe  maintenance  of  government  property  appears  to  be  a  reaction  to  observed  need. \nThere is a database for property and buildings collated in 1997, which has been added to by the \nproperty department of CIIC, but the information is now out of date and all information needed \nfor the development of meaningful maintenance and rehabilitation programs cannot be retrieved \nconveniently,  although  the  discussions  confirmed  steps  to  rectify  this  position  through  the \ndevelopment  of  an  up-to-date  information  system  for  property,  most  likely  in  geographic \ninformation  system  format.  The  system  is  being  developed  in-house  as  far  as  the  present \nworkload allows.  \n\nE. \n\nLegislation and Regulations \n\n20. \nThe Cook Islands Parliament is the sole lawmaking authority for the Cook Islands, with \nNew  Zealand  continuing  as  a  major  source  of  reference  for  new  enactments.  Cook  Island \nlegislators  and  law  draftspersons  are  now  increasingly  looking  further  afield  in  the  region  for \nprecedents  more  applicable  to  the  Cook  Islands  conditions  and  acceptability.  Because  of  the \nshortage  of  legal  drafting  skills  within  Crown  Law  and  in  government,  draft  legislation  is  often \nprepared by overseas experts who import ideas and approaches that are sometimes difficult to \nimplement locally and are not cognizant of local ways, conditions, and regulatory capacity. Many \ndrafts remain unapproved for long periods of time, or at best require considerable effort locally \nand many discussions and new drafts to bring local acceptance. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n53\n\n  \n21. \nThe lesson to be taken is that development of legislation and regulations needs to allow \nsufficient  time  for  the  progressive  refinement  of  drafts  and  for  the  considered  review  of  local \nstakeholders, which could take considerable time. \n\nF. \n\nLand \n\n22. \nLand  issues  are  central  to  the  infrastructure  sector  and  are  potentially  the  most  costly \nconstraint. CIIC has cited problems where existing leases for government-occupied buildings in \nthe Avarua area have expired or are due to expire, and where the landowners have advised that \nthey are not amenable to extending the leases. Planned improvements and extensions of roads, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  airports  will  depend  on  the  Government  reaching  mutually \nagreeable  arrangements  with  landowners.  All  water  sources,  reticulated  power  and  networks, \nand the major portion of the road networks are on privately owned land. \n\nG. \n\nUser Pay and Cost Recovery \n\n23.  While people accept paying for electricity and telecommunications, there is historical and \ncultural resistance in the Cook Islands to the charging of fees for services such as water supply, \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  disposal.  Projects  for  improvement  in  these  services  will  involve \nsignificant capital and operating investment and will require financial and economic justification \nfor this investment. For water, demand management will assume increasing importance for the \nsustainable management of a finite resource in the face of global climate change and the need \nfor contingency planning. \n \n24. \nDirect  payment  for  water  will  inevitably  become  part  of  the  demand  management \nstrategies. At present, reference is made to water being \u201cfree.\u201d This is far from the case as the \ncosts are met through government revenues including personal taxation and is \u201cpaid\u201d indirectly \nby the consumer. Over time, the costs are likely to become too high for the Government to bear \nwhile meeting its broader obligations within budget realities. The risk under these circumstances \nis  the  underfunding  of  the  activity  as  the  Government  juggles  other  priorities  and  demands. \nThere are indications of this at the present time.  \n \n25. \nTransparent costing of water and the direct charging of consumers enables consumers \nto identify costs and relate these to the level of service and standards of the supply provided, \nthereby empowering the consumer and water user groups with information that will allow them \nto  advocate  directly  with  the  supply  agency  for  service  levels  matching  their  expectations  and \nwillingness to pay. The Government needs to develop strategies for the recovery of the costs of \nservices and show how this will be achieved. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nGOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR1 \n\nA. \n\nThe Need for Improved Governance \n\nMany infrastructure services in the Cook Islands have been corporatized or are provided \n1. \nby  private  companies.  The  exceptions  are  water  supply,  solid  waste,  roads,  and  electricity \nsupply in the outer islands, which are provided by divisions of the Ministry of Infrastructure and \nPlanning (MOIP). Corporatized public enterprises that provide infrastructure services include the \nCook Islands Airport Authority, the Cook Islands Ports Authority, Telecom Cook Islands, and the \nRarotonga  power  supplier  (Te  Aponga  Uira).  MFEM  has  taken  an  active  role  in  overseeing \nMOIP\u2019s  infrastructure  line  departments,  by  setting  key  performance  targets  in  each  sector, \nmaking  provision  for  maintenance  expenditures,  and  monitoring  performance.  MFEM  also \nadministers procurement. \n \n2. \nThe  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  (CIIC)  provides  oversight  of  the  public \nenterprises, regulates tariffs, and monitors performance. However, it lacks the staff and budget \nneeded to effectively fill this function, and often can do little more than rubber-stamp the board \ndecisions  of  the  respective  entities.  The  CIIC  has  fewer  than  20  staff,  most  of  whom  are \ninvolved in repairs and maintenance in the property division, but is responsible for oversight of \naviation,  marine  transport,  telecommunications,  and  urban  electricity  in  the  Cook  Islands.  The \ncapacity of the CIIC needs to be expanded through selective recruitment and on-the-job training \nand possibly \u201ctwinning\u201d arrangements with overseas counterparts. \n \n3. \nResponsibility for infrastructure planning, provision, and regulation rests with several line \nministries  and  public  enterprises  that  suffer  from  capacity  constraints.  The  institutional \narrangements are fragmented and overlapping, and there has been a lack of coordination. This \nhas reduced the effectiveness of management regimes and ownership of policies. Most sectors \nlacks  the  clear  sector  policy  statements  needed  to  integrate  and  harmonize  each  sector\u2019s \noutputs and management with the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP). \n \n4. \nThe  legal  framework  for  infrastructure  needs  strengthening.  Laws  are  required  to \nestablish  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  new  agencies  that  are  needed.  The  draft  Islands \nGovernment  Bill  and  the  Ministry  of  Islands  Development  Bill  2002\u2014both  currently  stalled\u2014\nneed to be updated to take account of sector reforms and then enacted to legitimize activities \nand expenditure on the outer islands. The Rarotonga Water Supply Ordinance of 1960 needs to \nbe updated to establish minimum drinking water standards. Economic regulation practices are \noutdated  and  could  be  tailored  to  better  suit  the  Cook  Islands\u2019  new  economic  structure  and \nneeds. \n \n5. \nThe  performance  of  the  public  enterprises  is  clouded  by  their  often  unwritten,  but \nnevertheless  real  obligation,  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  social  objectives  (for  example,  by \nproviding  services  that  are  not  commercially  viable  or  charging  less  than  the  cost  of  supply, \nwithout transparent compensation from the Government). A general statement spelling out the \nGovernment\u2019s policy with regard to community service obligations would help service providers \nplan  operations  and  set  budgets.  Such  social  obligations  should  be  embodied  in  a  policy \nstatement  that  is  clear  to  everyone,  costed,  and  explicitly  subsidized  by  the  Government  as \ncommunity  service  obligations.  This  will  increase  accountability  and  transparency,  and  better \n\n                                                 \n1   The  analysis  of  this  appendix  draws  on  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  Preparing  the \n\nInfrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 7022-COO). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n55\n\nenable  the  performance  of  public  enterprises  to  be  gauged  from  their  financial  results.  The \nsame considerations apply to those line ministries providing infrastructure services. \n \n6. \nAsset performance needs to be optimized through the introduction of proper procedures \nand  simplified  plans  for  asset  management  within  the  capacity  and  resources  available. \nWarranted  actions  include  the  adoption  of  monitored  asset  management  plans  for  all \ngovernment  assets  under  consistent  criteria,  their  routine  auditing  by  the  Cook  Islands  Audit \nOffice,  and  long-term  planning  and  budgeting  for  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  as  required \nwith practical performance indicators. \n \n7. \nFurther issues to be faced in developing infrastructure include the process of selecting \npublic works and a low rate of cost recovery on public services. The competitive outsourcing of \ninfrastructure works to the private sector has the potential to be an important response to these \nproblems, requiring a further rethinking of the division of responsibilities between the public and \nprivate sectors. \n\nB. \n\nRoles and Responsibilities \n\n8. \nThe  Government,  acting  through  the  cabinet,  has  overall  responsibility  for  the \nInfrastructure  Governance  Framework  (IGF).  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nManagement  (MFEM)  has  the  role  of  assessing  the  financial  and  economic  implications  of \npolicies  and  programs  prepared  by  line  agencies.  The  aid  management  division  within  MFEM \nhas  had  an  important  role  in  infrastructure  development  because  of  the  high  levels  of \ninternational and bilateral assistance to the sector. However, the assumption of an infrastructure \ndevelopment role by the division and its attempts to direct the line agencies have given rise to \ninstitutional rivalries and resource mismatches, which the IGF is in part designed to correct.  \n \nThe  present  arrangement  is  for  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  have  overall \n9. \nresponsibility for approving and putting into effect the infrastructure development program of the \nGovernment,  and  therefore  for  implementing  the  IGF  and  for  advising  the  Government  on \nprogress  and  any  required  supportive  or  corrective  actions.  In  future,  the  IGF  envisages  that \nMOIP will report directly to the cabinet through its minister, with the Office of the Prime Minister \nproviding  an  external  check  on  its  performance.  The  National  Sustainable  Development \nCommission  (NSDC),  which  reports  directly  to  the  cabinet,  has  responsibility  for  reviewing  all \npotential infrastructure projects, including those falling within the IGF, and aligning them with the \npriorities  in  the  NSDP.  The  CIIC  infrastructure  committee  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  Prime \nMinister  and  is  responsible  for  (i)  taking  the  projects  reviewed  by  the  NSDC;  (ii)  initiating  and \nmonitoring their detailed planning, feasibility  assessment, and development by the responsible \nline  agencies  and  government-owned  enterprises;  and  (iii) agreeing  on  investment  project \nprioritization  and  funding  priority  for  the  Government\u2019s  endorsement.  However,  while  this \ndescribes the general expectations of how the NSDC and CIIC infrastructure committee should \noperate  and  interact,  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  each  agency  are  yet  to  be  formally \ndocumented  and  ratified  by  the  Government.  In  practice,  the  CIIC  infrastructure  committee \ncurrently  identifies  short-term  projects  and  assesses  priorities,  while  the  NSDC  operates  on  a \nlonger-term horizon.  \n \n10. \nBelow the Office of the Prime Minister and the CIIC infrastructure committee, the newly \nformed  MOIP  is  the  key  line  department  responsible  for  the  planning,  implementation,  and \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nmanagement  of  infrastructure  assets  held  directly  by  the  Government.2  The  Cook  Islands \nInvestment  Corporation  has  a  coordinating  role  for  those  infrastructure  sector  agencies \noperating  as  public  enterprises  and  as  government  statutory  authorities,  such  as  the  Cook \nIslands  Ports  Authority,  the  Cook  Islands  Airport  Authority,  and  Te  Aponga  Uira,  the \nstate-owned power supply company for Rarotonga.  \n\nC. \n\nProgress on the IGF \n\nThe  establishment  of  the  NSDC  and  of  the  CIIC  infrastructure  committee  were  key \n11. \ninitiating actions for the IGF. A third was the creation of MOIP in mid-2008 through the merger of \nthe  functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  and  the  Office  of  the  Minister  of  Island \nAdministration.  While  the  public  enterprises  and  statutory  authorities  have  organizational  and \nlegal structures that provide for a degree of independence and require a commercial approach \nto  their  areas  of  responsibility,  and  these  agencies  have  had  some  operating  experience,  the \nMOIP  is  new  and  only  partially  integrated  from  its  precursors,  operates  as  a  traditional \ngovernment  department,  and  will  require  a  greater  degree  of  internal  change  and  capacity \nbuilding before it is able to implement the IGF in its sectors of responsibility. This support is an \nimportant element of an ADB TA.3 \n\nD. \n\nActions for Implementing the IGF \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Reforms and Capacity Development \n\nInteragency  Relationships.  The  respective  functions  and  relationships  between  the \n12. \ncabinet,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  MFEM,  NSDC,  the  CIIC  infrastructure  committee, \nMOIP,  the  Audit  Office,  the  Public  Services  Commission,  the  proposed  Cook  Islands  Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Board  (CIWSSB),  and  the  existing  public  enterprises  and  statutory \nauthorities have been proposed. These will be confirmed, modified as necessary, and endorsed \nby the cabinet to form a firm basis for developing the institutional reforms, particularly the MOIP \nand the infrastructure advisory and approval role of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n13.  Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning. While MOIP has been created from the MOW \nand  the  Office  of  the  Minister  of  Island  Administration,  its  internal  management  and  staffing \nstructure,  functional  responsibilities  and  business  planning  processes  require  clear  definition. \nCurrently, it has an acting head, and a review of heads of ministry positions is due to take place \nin  mid-2009.  This  will  require  a  degree  of  staff  movement,  with  people  leaving  the  ministry, \nchanging roles, and new recruitment. Position descriptions and ratification through the PSC will \nbe required. This change management process is expected to take 2 years, commencing with \npreparation  of  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  the  future  of  MOIP,  followed  by  a  change \nmanagement  plan  for  the  staffing  structure,  positions  and  associated  legal  process,  then \nfollowed by implementation. \n \n14.  Water Supply and Sanitation. The formation of a self-accounting business unit within \nMOIP, responsible for water supply and sanitation (CIWSSB), operating on a \u201cuser-pays\u201d cost \nrecovery basis, subject to meeting community service obligations for which it would be funded \n\n                                                 \n2  MOIP  is  responsible  for  roads,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste,  government  buildings,  and  outer-island \n\n3  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  Cook  Islands  for  Infrastructure  Services  Delivery  Improvement.  Manila.

Developing the institutional structure, \nfunctional  responsibilities,  accounting  arrangements,  and  business  planning  processes  for  the \nCIWSSB would be a parallel action. \n \nCapacity  Development.  Institutional  capacity  issues  have  been  identified  that  need  to \n15. \nbe  addressed  as  part  of  the  IGF.  In  part,  these  are  the  lack  of  clear  demarcation  of \nresponsibilities and accountability between and within the government central departments and \nsector line agencies. This has given rise to overlaps and gaps in infrastructure governance that \nhave in some cases been a source of friction and wasted effort. Within the agencies, there is a \nneed  to  formally  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  attaching  to  management  and  senior \ntechnical  positions,  the  internal  lines  of  responsibility  and  reporting,  performance  review \nsystems,  and  matching  of  staff  qualifications  and  experience  with  the  requirements  of  each \nposition.  This  process  will  identify  staff  development  needs  and  in  some  cases,  the  need  to \nbetter  match  staff  with  positions.  At  lower  levels,  there  will  be  a  need  to  match  the  size  and \ncomposition  of  the  permanent  staff  to  the  work  flow,  and  to  decide  where  there  is  need  to \nrecruit, to retrench, and to reassign staff resources, and where outsourcing is likely to be more \ncost-effective in achieving the agency objectives.  \n \n16. \nA detailed implementation plan for the capacity development for each agency will result, \nincluding  individual  staff  personal  development  plans,  internal  and  external  training  schedules \nand  budgets.  Close  coordination  will  be  required  with  the  Office  of  the  Public  Services \nCommission  and  consideration  of  industrial  relations  and  social  impact.  Other  aspects  of \ncapacity  development  will  be  the  appropriate  design  and  functioning  of  business  support \nsystems, \ninformation \ntechnology. \n\nfinancial  control,  accounting,  and \n\nincluding  asset  management, \n\n2. \n\nInfrastructure Planning and Investment Programming \n\n17. \nSector Policy Statements. A policy statement is required for each subsector (transport, \nwater  and  sanitation,  solid  waste,  and  energy)  that  will  identify  (i)  the  subsector  goals,  (ii)  the \nobjectives by which these goals will be met, (iii) the role of the sector stakeholders, and (iv) the \nrights  of  the  community,  including  the  community  service  obligations  to  be  funded  by \ntransparent  subsidies  from  the  Government.  Subsector  objectives  will  typically  be  defined  as \nlevel of service provision to intermediate and end users in each subsector and target timeframes \nfor achievement. Line agencies will develop annual statements of intent for the year and report \non  achievements  linked  to  the  sector  policy  statements  and  performance  measurements \nappropriate to the subsector. \n \n18. \nTariffs,  Cost  Recovery,  and  Funding.  While  these  interrelated  issues  could  be \nincluded or summarized within the sector policy statements, they are of fundamental importance \nto  the  IGF,  are  likely  to  be  controversial,  and  should  be  set  out,  agreed  to  by  the  CIIC \ninfrastructure  committee,  and  endorsed  by  the  cabinet,  again  to  form  a  firm  basis  for  sector \ndevelopment. The main issues to be decided for each subsector are (i) the extent of investment \nand  ongoing  operational  funding  required  to  meet  the  service  levels  set  out  in  the  subsector \npolicy  statements;  (ii)  the  future  funding  envelope  that  can  be  identified  for  each  subsector, \nincluding funds from user charges, annual Government appropriation, and development partner \nassistance; (iii) the principles for, and levels of charges that can be sustained, by users of the \nservices  based  on  users\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  service  levels  and  other  concerns  such  as \nenvironmental protection and sustainability; (iv) the extent and on what basis certain individuals \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nor  groups  in  the  community  should  receive  subsidized  infrastructure  services;  and  (v)  the \ncommunity service obligations.  \n \n19. \nInfrastructure  Planning  and  Prioritization.  A  consistent  and  common  process  is \ndesirable  for  identifying,  evaluating,  and  prioritizing  infrastructure  investment  across  the \ninfrastructure  sector.  Ideally,  this  process  should  be  able  to  compare  investments  in  different \nsubsectors  using  common  principles  so  that  investment  in  water  supply  can  be  compared,  for \nexample,  with  investment  in  roads. However,  planning  and prioritization  within  each  subsector \ncan  be  an  interim  objective.  This  is  expected  to  be  a  development  of  the  project  identification \nand multi-criteria weight and rank scoring process developed in the IMP and currently applied \nby the CIIC infrastructure committee together with appropriate economic assessment.  \n \nInvestment Programming and Multi-Period Budgeting. The line agencies are moving \n20. \nfrom an annual cycle of funding requests and appropriations to multi-year budgeting with long- \n(6  to  10+  years),  medium-  (3\u20135  years)  and  short-term  (annual  plan)  expenditure  plans  based \nupon marrying the prioritized project program with the forecast future funding envelope and with \nother resource constraints such as processing and implementation capacity. The line agencies\u2019 \nprocesses  must  be  harmonized  with  those  of  Government\u2019s  central  fiscal  planning  and  with \nexternal  assistance.  The  investment  cycle  will  involve  (i)  setting  up  rolling  work  programs, \n(ii) integrating  the  asset  management  program  and  the  capital  works  financial  forecasts,  and \n(iii) making due provision for disaster risks. \n\n3. \n\nAsset Management Framework \n\n21. \nEach  line  agency  will  set  up  systems  for  managing  the  physical  assets  under  its \nresponsibility. These will be required for transport (roads, ports, airports), water and sanitation, \nsolid  waste  management,  energy,  and  government  buildings.  The  main  elements  of  the  asset \nmanagement  systems  that  will  be  established  are  (i)  asset  registers  and  inventories;  (ii)  asset \ncondition  and  level  of  service  inspections,  ratings  and  reporting;  (iii)  market,  replacement  and \ndepreciated  (book)  asset  values;  (iv)  asset  maintenance  and  replacement  policies;  (v)  asset \nmaintenance  work  planning,  costing,  implementation  and  monitoring;  (vi)  output  and  outcome \nperformance standards, and key performance indicator measurement and feedback. \n \n22. \nThe  asset  management  plans  will  conform  to  standard  templates  established  in \nconjunction with the Audit Office, which will conduct the independent annual audits. The asset \nmanagement plans will be harmonized to the absorptive capacity of the Cook Islands, and will \nbe as simple and robust as possible consistent with gathering the minimum information needed \nto perform the asset management task and recording the maintenance inputs and costs against \nitems in the asset register. The monitoring will be rigorous and continuing in the form of regular \nmonthly  review  and  reporting  of  program  exceptions  by  the  line  agencies,  annual  review  and \nreporting  to  the  cabinet  to  assess  achievements  and  to  align  future  programs.  An  annual \ncommunity and user satisfaction survey will form part of the monitoring.  \n\n4. \n\nLegislative Review and Amendments \n\n23. \nThe  IGF  will  need  to  be  supported  by  legislative  change  in  some  areas,  and  the \ndevelopment of legal specifications, legal drafting, and passage into law will be integral with a \nnumber of the institutional, policy and financial management changes noted above.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n59\n\nSOCIAL AND GENDER ANALYSIS1 \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nCompared with residents of most developing countries, the people of the Cook Islands \n1. \nhave a high standard of living. Internationally, the Cook Islands is a high-ranking middle-income \ncountry. Life expectancy is high at 71 years, infant mortality is low at 15\u201320 per 1,000 live births, \nimmunization rates reach almost 100%, secondary school enrollment rates exceed 90%, adult \nliteracy is high, and most Millennium Development Goals have already been met or will be met \nby  2015.  The  Cook  Islands  also  performs  well  regionally  regarding  gender-based  indexes  of \ndevelopment. \n \nThese  achievements  reflect  a  long  history  of  heavy  government  investment  in  health, \n2. \neducation,  and  welfare  buttressed  by  a  good  natural  resource  base  and  the  benefits  of  close \nintegration with New Zealand. A substantial improvement in the quality of economic and public \nsector management since the financial crisis of the mid-1990s also underpins living standards. \nFor understandable reasons, the Cook Islands now looks to New Zealand to set its benchmarks \nfor service standards, opportunities, and incomes. \n \n3. \nThis  level  of  well-being  is  nevertheless  fragile.  Small  island  developing  states  like  the \nCook Islands are vulnerable to events beyond their control, particularly environmental hazards. \nFor example, in the mid-1990s the Cook Islands faced a devastating cyclone and an outbreak of \ndisease that badly affected pearl production, and in the FY2006 cyclone season, Rarotonga and \nthe southern group experienced five cyclones. Despite good living standards and achievements \nin education and health, there is little cash employment outside Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Many \nhouseholds  get  much  of  their  livelihood  from  pensions  and  other  social  security  payments, \nparticularly on the outer islands, and the lack of economic dependence is a source of fragility, as \nis the high rate of out-migration. \n \n4. \nBeyond  a  general  pattern  of  outer-island  disadvantage,  the  vulnerable  are  the  people \nwho are least able to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and who often have special \nneeds  and  require  extra  help.  The  reasons  given  for  people  becoming  vulnerable  include  the \nbreakdown in traditional family support systems, emigration, a rising cost of living, and ruinous \nsocial  and  community  obligations.  The  vulnerable  are  the  elderly,  the  unemployed,  single \nparents, children, the disabled, squatters, and victims of crime. The last two categories are by \nfar  the  smallest.  Although  there  is  currently  no  significantly  large  group  of  squatters,  the \nimpending  expiration  of  land  leases  on  Rarotonga  affects  some  outer-island  communities \nresiding  there,  as  uncertain  tenure  makes  repairing  or  upgrading  housing  difficult.  The  Cook \nIslands  has  an  effective  justice  system,  and  most  victims  of  crime  receive  some  form  of \nreparation.  \n\nB. \n\nThe Rarotonga\u2013Outer Island Divide \n\nThroughout the modern history of the Cook Islands, the main line of difference in living \n5. \nstandards and the range of personal opportunities has been drawn between Rarotonga and the \nouter  islands.  While  there  have  been  no  studies  of  poverty  in  the  Cook  Islands,  available \nstatistics  support  the  perception  widely  held  within  the  community  that  the  key  equity  issue \nremains the disparity between Rarotonga and other islands.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The  sector  diagnostics  presented  in  this  appendix  draw  heavily  on  ADB.  2008.  Cook  Islands  2008  Social  and \n\nEconomic Report: Equity in Development. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \nThe  statistics  report  that,  compared  with  the  outer  islands,  fewer  people  in  Rarotonga \n6. \nhave  very  low  cash  incomes  and  considerably  more  are  in  the  middle-income  bracket.  The \naverage cash income on Rarotonga is noticeably higher than the average national income. This \noutcome  is  linked  to  education  standards.  Household  income  and  expenditure  surveys  have \nfound  that  the  educational  level  attained  by  the  household  head,  rather  than  his  or  her  sex  or \nage,  most  influences  the  amount  that  a  household  earns  or  spends.  A  higher  standard  of \neducation  is  generally  associated  with  higher  income.  The  concentration  of  higher  household \nincomes on Rarotonga is therefore linked to the concentration of more educated people there, \nas  well  as  to  the  more  highly  paid  livelihoods  that  they  have  access  to.  The  education  and \nlivelihood  disadvantage  of  outer  island  populations  is  compounded  by  their  age  and  sex \nstructures with more elderly and more women. \n \nThe  distribution  of  well-being\u2015viewed  subjectively  or  objectively\u2015is  reflected  in  the \n7. \nmovement  of  people.  For  the  past  several  decades,  the  predominant  migration  flow  has  been \nfrom the outer islands to Rarotonga, and from Rarotonga to New Zealand and beyond. This flow \nreinforces the community perception of the disadvantage faced by the outer islands. \n \n8. \nThe economic reform program in the mid-1990s is a key factor behind the Rarotonga\u2013\nouter  island  divide.  The  reforms  carried  with  them  a  risk  of  the  accentuating  economic \ninequalities.  The  expectation  that  the  reforms  would  foster  economic  growth  by  creating \nemployment, \nredistributing \nincreasing  government  spending  on  basic  services,  and \nopportunities  to  poor  communities  has  proved  to  be  overoptimistic  for  most  outer-island \ncommunities. The economies of Rarotonga and Aitutaki did respond well, and there have been \nsome service improvements. But the large losses of people, skills, and paid jobs appear to have \nhastened  the  decline  in  outer-island  economies.  Some  communities  now  stay  alive  only  by \nreceiving social security payments and taking on responsibility for grandchildren.  \n \nThe National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010 described the Rarotonga\u2013Outer \n9. \nIsland divide in the follow terms: \u201cA fundamental development challenge is to achieve economic \ngrowth and social development that is more evenly spread across all islands and that involves \nless reliance on public service jobs and social security benefits as sources of cash income.\u201d2  \n\nC. \n\nThe Significance of Gender \n\n10. \nAnother  general  pattern  of  disadvantage  is  by  gender.  By  regional  standards,  Cook \nIslands  women  score  highly  on  the  gender  development  index  and  gender  empowerment \nmeasure.  Compared  with  Cook  Islands  men,  they  have  substantially  longer  life  expectancy \n(74.3  years,  or  6.3  years  longer  than  men)  and  higher  secondary  school  enrollment.  Primary \nschool enrollments and reported adult literacy rates are equal for males and females. The main \ndisadvantages for Cook Islands women are their relatively restricted opportunities for economic \nand  political  participation,  generally  lower  earning  capacity,  and  remaining  subtle  forms  of \ngender bias.  \n \nThe equality of men and women is recognized by the Constitution and in family law, as \n11. \nwell as by tradition in regard to the inheritance of land and rights of land use. Yet no legislation \nexplicitly  prevents  discrimination  against  women,  nor  are  there  affirmative  action  initiatives  to \npromote  equality  between  men  and  women.  Despite  equal  opportunity  for  women  in  most \n\n                                                 \n2  Cook Islands Government. 2006. National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010. Office of the Prime Minister. \n\nRarotonga. p. 27. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n61\n\nrespects,  the  National  Policy  on  Women  (1995)  noted:  \u201cSubtle  elements  of  discrimination \nagainst  women  perpetuated  by  culture,  custom  and  tradition  continue  to  exist  in  Cook  Island \nsociety today. The continued stereotyping and confining of women\u2019s roles and responsibilities to \nthe domestic arena limits their participation in the development process.\u201d3  \n \nCensus data report higher employment rates for males. These data conventionally play \n12. \ndown women\u2019s work by defining a large part of their domestic activities as \u201cuneconomic,\u201d while \nmen  engaged  in  similar  activities  such  as  village  agriculture,  or  unemployed,  are  more  often \ndescribed as being economically active. What is nevertheless clear is the growing participation \nof  women  in  wage  employment  outside  of  agriculture,  which,  for  example,  rose  from  38%  in \n1991 to 44% in 1996 and 46% in 2001. \n \n13. \nAlongside this paid work, women spend slightly more time than men caring for children \nand  other  family  members  and  on  such  domestic  chores  as  preparing  food,  cleaning  house, \nshopping, and doing home repairs. Most importantly, census data show that a significant gender \ndifference  remains  in  earnings  for  paid  employment.  More  women  than  men  are  in  the  lowest \nincome bracket, and more men than women are in the highest-earning groups.  \n \n14. \nThe  past  decade  has,  however,  been  a  period  of  great  change.  Since  the  mid-1990s, \nmore job opportunities have opened up for women. Although the public service has contracted, \nmore  women  now  work  at  its  senior  levels.  This  change  has  been  described  as  one  of  the \nleast-expected  outcomes  of  the  mid-1990s  reform.  Along  with  their  growing  share  of  paid \nemployment,  more  women  now  run  small  businesses.  Areas  of  business  activity  that  have \nattracted women are handicraft production, agricultural and marine products, and tourism.  \n \n15. \nNot all women are doing well, however. Households headed by women suffer elevated \nrisk of having low incomes or being socially isolated, and their number is growing. Most of those \nwho  receive  allowances  from  the  Social  Welfare  Department  for  destitution  are  single-women \nheads of households with children to support but little income. These women generally are too \nyoung for old-age benefits, and their children are too old (over the age of 10, now changed to \n12) to receive the child benefit. The destitute allowance is essentially a stopgap between social \nsecurity payments, a de facto unemployment benefit.  \n\nD. \n\nThe Elderly \n\n16. \nAs traditional family support systems weaken, an especially vulnerable group comprises \nelderly people living alone or supporting grandchildren. Because of the pattern of out-migration \nand  the  aging  population,  these  are  often  elderly  women,  who  suffer  a  real  risk  of  social \nisolation,  especially  in  more-traditional  outer-island  communities.  As  these  communities  have \nshrunk and aged, support systems within them have attenuated. Beyond traditional community \nties  among  cousins,  neighbors,  and  church  congregations,  the  elderly  look  for  their  principal \nmaterial  and  emotional  support  from  children  and  grandchildren,  yet  increasingly  find \nthemselves  on  the  remote  edge  of  family  networks  now  centered  on  Rarotonga  or  in \nNew Zealand.  Social  support  can  come  down  to  finding  the  money  for  airfare  or  a  child  or \ngrandchild willing to return. That may not be enough.  \n \n17. \nThe geriatric ward at the Rarotonga Hospital serves as a de facto old people\u2019s home for \ninfirm elderly people who have no family to care for them. There is no other residential facility in \n\n                                                 \n3 Department of Women. 1995. National Policy on Women. Ministry of Internal Affairs.

However a program supported by the Rotary Club and the Ministry of Health \noperates a day center for elderly people on Rarotonga. \n\n62 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nE. \n\nDisabled People \n\n18. \nDisabled people are another vulnerable group, mainly because of their limited access to \neducation and livelihood opportunities, although they do receive a special security payment. A \nsurvey in 2001 located 641 people with disabilities\u2015at 4.2% of the resident population, around \nthe  expected  number  in  any  population.  Only  50%  of  the  119  disabled  children  of  school  age \nattended school, even though attendance is supposedly compulsory.  \n\nF. \n\nThe Social Security System \n\n19. \nThe Cook Islands has no sizable group of very poor people. An important reason for this \nis the high level of social security allowances that Cook Islanders receive, whether they reside in \nNew Zealand or the Cook Islands. \n \n20. \nThe Cook Islands social security system is modeled on the New Zealand system but has \nthe important differences of being less comprehensive and providing smaller payments. In the \nCook Islands, payments are made to all children aged up to 12 years (extended from 10 years \nin July 2006) and to all people aged 60 years and above. Special payments are made to people \nbetween these ages who are infirm or destitute. One-off grants equivalent to 1 month\u2019s benefit \nare  made  to  the  families  of  deceased  beneficiaries  to  help  pay  funeral  costs.  Other  special \nassistance is given for improving the residences of disabled people.  \n \n21. \nUnlike New Zealand, the Cook Islands offers no unemployment benefits. Cook Islanders \nwho  move  to  New  Zealand  are  eligible  for  unemployment  and  related  benefits  there  and,  as \nelderly  people,  can  later  bring  back  with  them  to  the  Cook  Islands  the  higher-paying \nNew Zealand  old-age  pensions.  Other  payments  received  by  some  elderly  people  include \nsuperannuation, pensions of various kinds, and life insurance payouts. \n \n22. \nAlmost  all  payments  are  made  without  any  means  testing  (without  determining  need), \nand it is perhaps a misnomer to describe it as a welfare system. For example, in 2007 payments \nwere made for 1,464 elderly and 4,943 children with the only criteria being age and residency, \nwhile only 227 people receive payments for infirmities and 43 for destitution. And even funding \nfor these small groups is not according to strict needs-based definitions. For example, tiny but \nfood-rich  Mauke  is  home  to  18%  of  destitute  cases  while  generally  poorer  Pukapuka  and \nPenrhyn  account,  together  with  Manihiki,  have  only  2%  of  such  cases.  The  infirm  are  mostly \n(though  loosely)  part  of  the  group  of  true  welfare  recipients.  The  destitute  generally  are  the \nworst off among the unemployed, being adults with no other livelihood. \n \n23. \nHousehold  income  and  expenditure  surveys  have  found  that  social  security  payments \ncontribute  to  the  incomes  of  most  households,  largely  because  they  are  untargeted.  As  such, \nthe  system  could  be  better  described  as  income  supplementation  rather  than  welfare.  The \nrationale for the payments is largely historical, based on the culture of egalitarian socialism that \nexisted  in  New  Zealand  during  the  mid-20th  century,  and  is  an  institution  that  is  politically \ndifficult to dismantle.  \n \n24. \nThe  Cook  Islands\u2019  social  security  system  therefore  redistributes  a  lot  of  money,  is \nexpensive, and is likely to become more so. At the same time, it does not effectively address the \nneeds of all people who are vulnerable to hardship or poverty during some stage of their life. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n63\n\nG.  \n\nOther Support for the Disadvantaged \n\n25. \nThe  Government\u2019s  remaining  response  to  the  disadvantaged  largely  rests  on  the \nprovision of services to the outer islands and social security payments. It will be difficult to make \nfurther  substantial  progress  toward  addressing  the  present  imbalance  in  living  standards \nthrough funding alone. Funding already favors the outer islands, to the point of overfunding in \nsome  cases,  and  the  additional  cost  of  raising  outer-island  service  standards  to  those  on \nRarotonga is prohibitive.  \n \n26. \nHowever, some progress could be made by setting and meeting minimum standards of \nservices,  addressing  inequities  among  islands  in  funding  for  key  services,  and  finding  a \nmore-workable  approach  to  decentralization  that  gives  local  communities  a  greater  role  in \ndecisions  affecting  outer  islands.  Most  services  are  supplied  and  managed  by  the  central \nGovernment with little community input. Communities are most concerned with the standards of \nthe  services  on  their  island  but  consider  them  something  that  they  simply  receive.  Teachers \noften  cite  community  apathy  as  their  principal  problem;  this  suggests that  the  rift goes  in  both \ndirections.  Other  government  services  as  well\u2015women\u2019s  affairs,  youth  and  sports,  and \nconsumer affairs\u2015now have little direct community input.  \n \nIn 2000, the Ministry of  Education adopted its Policy for Special Education to integrate \n27. \ndisabled  children  into  normal  classrooms  wherever  possible.  A  special  education  adviser, \nappointed  in  2000,  trains  teachers  to  identify  and  assist  children  with  special  needs,  including \nthose  who  underperform  on  proficiency  examinations.  The  only  special  facilities  for  disabled \nchildren are on Rarotonga, where the Disabled Persons Center, a nongovernment organization, \nruns  a  special  education  classroom  at  Avarua  Primary  School  and  the  Ministry  of  Education \npays  the  salaries  of  the  two  teachers.  The  center  provides  transport  for  children  but  caters \nmainly  to  people  in  the  Avarua  area.  Transportation  to  school  is  difficult  for  severely  disabled \nchildren\u2014another reason why many stay home. Efforts are being made on the outer islands to \nprovide for disabled children in the schools, but these are nevertheless the children most likely \nto miss out on education. \n \nPartly  funded  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International \n28. \nDevelopment, the Creative Center on Rarotonga was established in 2000 to provide services for \ndisabled  adults  over  the  age  of  16.  Operating  part-time,  the  center  gives  disabled  people  an \nopportunity to develop creative skills and life skills, to socialize, and to stimulate their learning. \nAgain, there are no such facilities in the outer islands. \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n971 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nExpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev.  3)  or  any  successor  groups  or  subgroups  under  future  revisions  to  the \nSITC, as designated by ADB by notice to the Borrower: \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A13: Ineligible Items \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.7 \n\n728.43 \n897.3 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco,  manufactured  (whether  or  not  containing  tobacco \nsubstitute \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear  reactors,  and  parts  thereof,  fuel  elements  (cartridges), \nnon-irradiated for nuclear reactors \nTobacco processing machinery \nJewelry of gold, silver or platinum-group metals (except watches \nand  watch  cases)  and  goldsmiths\u2019  or  silversmiths\u2019  wares \n(including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\nSource: United Nations.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Cook  Islands  National  Sustainable  Development  Plan  (NSDP)  2007\u20132010  is  to  build  a \nsustainable  future  that  meets  economic  needs  without  compromising  prudent  economic  management,  environmental \nintegrity,  social  stability  and  the  needs  of  future  generations.  The  NSDP  identifies  eight  goals  as  priority  areas  for \nimplementation.  Two  of  these  are  (i)  an  innovative  and  well-managed  private-sector-led  economy;  and  (ii)  strengthened \nand affordable basic infrastructure, transport, and utilities to support national development.  \n \nBroadening of economic activity and private sector development are key strategies for improving economic growth rates \nand reducing poverty and will be supported through the program. Elements of the program will also contribute directly to \npoverty reduction through the ring-fencing of some essential services used by the vulnerable from government expenditure \ncuts and the maintenance of the real value of social welfare payments.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n\nBeyond a general pattern of outer island disadvantage, the vulnerable of the Cook Islands are the people  who are least \nable to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and who often have special needs and require extra help. The reasons \ngiven for people becoming vulnerable include the breakdown  in  the traditional family support systems, emigration, rising \ncost of living, and ruinous social and community obligations. The vulnerable are identified as being elderly, unemployed, \nsingle parents, children, disabled, squatters, and victims of crime. \n\nAnother  general  pattern  of  disadvantage  is  by  gender.  The  main  disadvantages  for  Cook  Islands\u2019  women  are  their \nrelatively restricted opportunities for economic and political participation, generally lower earning capacity, and remaining \nsubtle  forms  of  gender  bias.  The  continued  stereotyping  and  confining  of  women\u2019s  roles  and  responsibilities  to  the \ndomestic arena limits their participation in the development process. \n\nThere is no formal system in the Cook Islands for targeting the vulnerable other than fairly loosely through the distribution \nof social security payments. There is almost no systematic analysis of who the disadvantaged are, their needs and means \nof  addressing  these  needs.  Because  of  the  widely  held\u2015but  not  necessarily  correct\u2015perception  that  good  health, \neducation  and  living  standards  are  well  distributed  in  the  Cook  Islands  and  there  is  therefore  little  poverty,  poverty \nreduction does not figure prominently in Government plans and policies. While there has long been an emphasis on equity \nin  public  policy,  especially  in  access  to  basic  services  such  as  health  and  education,  and  in  outer  island  development, \nmore could be done to raise the focus on the disadvantaged.  \n\n2. Design Features.  \nThe  program  provides  for  the  provision  of  targeted  actions  to  support  the  vulnerable  members  of  the  community. \nGovernment  programs  are  to  be  explicitly  reoriented  to  reduce  social  security  benefits  to  the  most  well  off  and  to  use \nsavings to provide extra targeted support to the vulnerable members of the community. \n \nThere  are  no  specific  pro-poor  design  features  of  support  for  infrastructure.  However  as  implementation  of  the  IGF \nprogresses and issues such as user pays charges and community service obligations are tackled pro-poor policy positions \nare expected to be taken by Government. During implementation of the infrastructure governance framework (IGF) poverty \nanalysis  will  be  required  in  relation  to  changes  made  to  public  sector  provision  of  infrastructure  services\u2014these  may \ninclude providers of power, water, telecommunications, and banking services. This should include both analysis of impact \nof  any  changes  (including  in  tariffs  and  service  quality)  on  current  clients  and  also  on  potential  clients  where  access  to \nservices is increased. This analysis should inform the design of community service obligations and allow better targeting of \nsafety nets to ensure the access of the poorest to basic levels of services. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11   \n\n69\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nKey Issues. The impact of the program on the budget should provide benefits to the Cook Islands economy and the Cook \nIslands\u2019  people.  The  specific  areas  of  impact  will  be  dependent  on  the  decisions  the  Government  makes  once  a \nstrengthened policy and legislative environment is put in place and so is unable to be assessed at this point.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nSignificant consultation and participation was carried out with the support of TA 7022-COO during the development of the \nIGF. \n \n2.
