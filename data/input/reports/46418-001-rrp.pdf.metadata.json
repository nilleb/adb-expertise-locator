The  project  will  refurbish  electric  and  mechanical  equipment  for  power \ngeneration and transmission at the Golovnaya hydropower plant in Tajikistan. This will increase \nthe availability of clean power for domestic sales and for export to Afghanistan. The project will \nincrease the generation capacity and operational efficiency of the power plant.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nfor  Tajikistan \n\nThe  total  installed  generation  capacity  of  Tajikistan  is  5,055  MW.  Most  (98%)  of  the \n3. \ncountry\u2019s  generation  is  hydropower,  which  is  impacted  by  hydrologic  fluctuation,  resulting  in \nsummer  surpluses  and winter  deficits. Tajikistan\u2019s  power generation  assets  have  outlived  their \nuseful  economic  and  technical  life.  Maintenance  has  been  insufficient  because  of  a  lack  of \nspare  parts  and  funding  at  Barki  Tojik,  the  vertically  integrated  state  power  utility.  The  power \nsector  regional  master  plan,  prepared  in  2012  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  program, 3  found  that  nearly  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  generation  and \ntransmission  assets  needed  to  be  replaced  in  order  to  meet  demand  and  eliminate  the  winter \npower  deficit.  The  master  plan  identified  rehabilitation  of  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant  as  a \npriority  project.  The  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132014 \nidentifies \nrehabilitation of existing hydropower plants as  a key area of intervention.4 Reliable and secure \noperation of the large generation plant and high voltage transmission network is essential to the \nreliability of the interconnected regional grid, and a prerequisite for power trade with neighboring \ncountries. \n \n4. \nGolovnaya  hydropower  plant  is  situated  80  kilometers  south  of  Dushanbe.  It  has  an \ninstalled  generation  capacity  of  240  MW,  making  it  the  fourth-largest  hydropower  plant  in \nTajikistan  after  the  Nurek  (3,000  MW),  Sangtuda  1  (670  MW)  and  Baipaza  (600  MW) \nhydropower plants. Construction of the Golovnaya hydropower plant began in 1956 and the last \nunit was commissioned in 1964. Since then, no major improvements or modernization has been \ncarried out to maintain the original performance in terms of efficiency, reliability and safety, or to \nreduce  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  except  on  one  power  generation  unit.  The \ncondition of the plant\u2019s main electro- and hydro-mechanical equipment is now very poor. In 1993 \nand 1994, unit 2 was partially flooded because of the failure of the hydraulic system to operate \nthe main spillway gate and six sediment sluice gates, which have flood discharge capability.  If \nupstream  hydropower  plants  must  spill  water  in  an  emergency,  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant \ncould be flooded. In addition, because of an original design deficiency, the power plant lacks oil \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The project is a follow-up to ADB. 2006. Project Preparatory Technical Assistance: Power Rehabilitation Phase II. \nManila  (PPTA-4596).  Due  diligence  and  a  feasibility  study  for  the  proposed  project  was  prepared  by  the  sector \noperational  performance  improvement  consultants  under  ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n\f2       \n\ncontainment facilities for the main transformers, which is standard emergency safety equipment.  \n \n5. \nOver  2005\u20132012,  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant  generated  an  average  of  about  840 \ngigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  annum;  average  annual  generation  has  decreased  since  2003 \nbecause of the increasing frequency of generation unit breakdowns. There are 52,560 available \nworking  hours  for  the  six  units  per  year.  In  2011  they  operated  for  24,720  hours,  were  under \nrepair and/or emergency shutdown for 27,135 hours, and were on standby for 705 hours. Unit 4 \nfailed and was rehabilitated in 2012.5 It is expected that the remaining units will fail in 5 years or \nless if major rehabilitation works are not undertaken urgently.  \n \n6. \nThe transformers and the 110/220 kilovolt (kV) switchyard of the Golovnaya hydropower \nplant play a vital role in the region, because: (i) they allow the production of hydropower plants \nto be evacuated to the transmission system\u2014this is the only switchyard that allows power to be \nevacuated from downstream hydropower plants at Perepadnaya (30 MW) and Centralnaya (15 \nMW); and (ii) they are used to connect the 220-kV and 110-kV networks, and supply power to \nabout one million people and 30% of Barki Tojik\u2019s industrial and commercial customers.  \n \n7. \nThe  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant  rehabilitation  project  is  also  important  regionally.  In \n1987,  the  first  power  transmission  interconnection  was  established  between  the  Geran \nsubstation in Tajikistan and Kunduz in Afghanistan. Until today, the Geran\u2013Kunduz 110-kV line \nis the only source of power for Kunduz. Tajikistan exports power through this line throughout the \nyear, with exports increasing by 30% on the average per year since 2008, reaching 106 GWh in \n2011.  Golovnaya  switchyard  is  the  only  source  of  power  for  Geran  substation,  and  further \nexports to Kunduz. The demand in northern Afghanistan is expected to grow as the Government \nof Afghanistan intends to expand the distribution network in the region. A new 220-kV substation \nin  Kunduz  is  under  construction,  which  will  be  supplied  by  power  from  the  newly  constructed \n220 kV  overhead transmission  line from Tajikistan.6   However,  due to  compatibility  issues, the \nnetwork  in Kunduz  will,  in the  interim,  be  split  into  two  islanded grids;  one  supplied  by  the  old \nGeran\u2013Kunduz 110-kV line and another by the new 220-kV line.  \n \n8. \nThe  financing  of  the  project  was  requested  by  the  Government  of  Tajikistan.  The \nproposed project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132014.7 The project is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014 for Tajikistan,8 and in the medium-\nterm priority projects list of the CAREC Energy Sector Coordinating Committee.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  an  increase  in  the  supply  of  renewable  energy  to \nnational and regional power systems from 743 GWh in 2012 to 1,130 GWh in 2026. The project \noutcome will be an increased weighted average generation efficiency of the power plant, from of \n83% to 89%.  \n \n\n                                                \n5   The  Islamic  Development  Bank,  cofinancing  ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  output  will  be  a  rehabilitated  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant  and  its \nswitchyards, with generation capacity increased from 240 MW to 252 MW. The rehabilitation of \nthe  hydropower  plant  envisages full  replacement  of  units  1,  2,  and  5  and  is  expected  to  bring \nsubstantial improvements in power generation, including during the winter power deficit season. \nThe  average  annual  generation  is  expected  to  be  1,130  GWh  in  2021,  based  on  hydrologic \naverages over the last two decades. The amount of electricity generated will increase because \nof more efficient turbines and generators. Currently, the old units have a maximum efficiency of \n83%, discharging 180 cubic meters of water per second per turbine. After the rehabilitation, the \nefficiency  of  the  new  units  will  increase  to  92%,  while  discharging  only  120  cubic  meters  of \nwater  per  second  per  turbine,  because  of  the  higher  efficiency  curve  of  the  new  turbine-\ngenerator.9 Replacement of the turbines and generators enables 9% percentage point increase \nin  efficiency,  while  reducing  water  discharge  by  33%.  The  rehabilitation  will  also  include  the \ninstallation of two new transformers with oil containment facilities to prevent oil spills in the case \nof  an  emergency.  The  project  will  also  install  new  control  system  for  all  six  units,  replace  the \nspillway  gate  and  sediment  sluices;  and  rehabilitate  electric  and  control  equipment  in \n110/220 kV switchyards.  \n \nD. \n \n11. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $170 million.  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nAmounta \n\n \nA. \n\n \n Base Costsb \n\n \n \n\nGolovnaya Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation \n \nSubtotal (A) \n \nB.

Procurement  will  follow  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures using standard bidding documents for plant design, supply, and install \ncontracts.  The  EPC  contract  for  rehabilitation  of  generation  units  will  use  a  two-stage  bidding \nprocedure  without  prequalification  due to  the technical  complexity  typical for  hydropower  plant \nrehabilitation projects. The EPC contract for rehabilitation of switchyards will use a single-stage \ntwo-envelope  bidding  procedure  without  prequalification.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Industry \nconsultants,  funded  under  the  Regional  Power  Transmission  Project,12 will  assist  the  PMU  in \npreparing  bidding  documents  and  bid  evaluation  and also  provide  additional  hands-on training \nto the PMU procurement staff. \n\nTo  expedite  project \n\n \n17. \nBarki  Tojik  will  employ  a  project  implementation  consultant  firm.  This  consultant  will \nprovide  technical,  financial,  and  administrative  support  to  the  PMU  during  the  entire  project \nimplementation  period.  ADB  grant  proceeds  will  cover  the  cost  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants. The consultant recruitment will follow ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a \nquality:cost ratio of 90:10 will be applied to the selection of project implementation consultants \ndue to technical complexity associated with hydropower plant rehabilitation projects. ADB's prior \napproval is needed for changing the selection method. Ministry of Energy and Industry (MOEI) \nconsultants will assist the PMU in the recruitment of consultants. \n \nimplementation,  ADB  management  has  approved  advance \n18. \ncontracting  for  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  government  to  start \nprocurement activities at its own risk, prior to the signing of the grant agreement, but does not \nallow  signing  a  contract  with  a  firm  before  the  grant  has  become  effective.  ADB  informed  the \ngovernment  that  such  advance  contracting  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), and informed the \ngovernment  and  Barki  Tojik  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the proposed project. \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  77-month  period  from  February  2014  to  July \n2020. The implementation consultant will prepare a detailed implementation schedule during the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n21. \nADB and the Ministry of Energy and Industry conducted in-depth technical due diligence \non  the  investment  proposal  to  minimize  the  cost  overrun  risk  usually  associated  with \nhydropower plant rehabilitation projects. The inspection work included complete dismantling and \nrelated  inspection  of  one  of  the  units;  testing  of  the  spillway  gate  and  stop  log  operations, \nsediment sluice operations, the canal siphon bypass operation, unit synchronization, and gantry \nand  power  house  operations;  and  inspection  of electric  equipment  and control  of  switchyards. \nThe technical due diligence also assessed the condition of the civil structures and dam stability. \nThe inspection found that the structures satisfy the operational requirements of the hydropower \n                                                \n12 ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the \n\nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Project. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6       \n\nplant  and  no  significant  deterioration  or  movement  has  occurred  over  the  last  50  years.  A \nstability  assessment  of  the  main  water-related  structures,  the  powerhouse,  and  the  spillway \nconcluded  that  both  sections  meet  dam  safety  requirements  for  sliding  and  the  position  of \nresultant  and  foundation  stresses  under  normal  and  flood  load  conditions.  Various  cost \nestimation  methods  were  used  to  obtain  up-to-date  quotations  for  water-to-wire  equipment, \nwhich comprise a major portion of the rehabilitation works. The project implementation schedule \nwas prepared taking into account the annual seasonality of water flows to minimize flood risk.  \n\n \nADB is satisfied with the quality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of \n22. \nthe technology, and the execution plan. The \u201creadiness\u201d level is high and the proposed technical \nsolutions are assessed to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. Barki Tojik\u2019s operational \nand maintenance staff is familiar with the proposed design concepts. The technical proposals do \nnot represent a shift from existing practices. \n\n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  17.3%,  confirming  the  project\u2019s \neconomic  viability.  The  project  will  extend  the  economic  life  of  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant, \nincrease  generation  capacity,  and  enhance  energy  output.  The  project\u2019s  cost  streams  (i.e., \ncapital  investment  and  O&M),  which  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  expected  benefits  (i.e., \npower consumption and export sales), were compared with the cost streams under a \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d  scenario  based  on  2013  constant  prices  for  the  project  life  of  50  years.  The  without-\nproject  scenario  assumes  no  significant  rehabilitation  takes  place  and  the  existing  units  fail  to \noperate  one  by  one  during  the  next  30  years  according  to  the  expected  life  of  each  unit.  The \nincremental benefits attributable to increased output are measured based on willingness to pay \nand export sales after taking into account technical losses and summer surplus. The sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  under  adverse  conditions, \nincluding increased capital and O&M costs, and reduced benefits. \n \n24. \nThe financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the project. The financial internal \nrate of return of 4.3% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.2%. Based on the \nwith- and without-project comparison, the project cash flow, measured at 2013 constant prices \nfor  the  project  life  of  50  years,  reflects  the  costs  (capital  investment  and  O&M)  and  revenues \n(domestic sales and exports of electricity) attributable to the project, taking into account system \nlosses and taxes, from the Barki Tojik perspective. The project remains financially viable under \nthe  assumption  that  the  end-user  tariffs  continue  to  increase  at  the  current  rate  of  16%  per \nannum  in  real  term.  The  sensitivity  analysis  also  confirms  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability \nunder adverse conditions.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Barki  Tojik.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's  Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy \n\n \n\n\frequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 11). \n \n26. \nThe recent financial performance of Barki Tojik has been weak and unstable, generating \nlosses  for  FY2007\u2013FY2009,  profits  for  FY2010\u2013FY2011,  and  losses  again  in  FY2012.  Barki \nTojik\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  requires  significant  improvement.  External  auditing  for \nFY2011  and  FY2012  based  on  international  audit  standards  indicate  major  issues  with  (i) \nvaluation  of  inventory,  (ii)  revaluation  of  assets,  (iii)  records  on  account  receivables  and \npayables, and (iv) data conciliation of revenues.13 Barki Tojik\u2019s accounting policies, procedures \nand  financial  reporting  follow  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  which  is  required \nunder  the  Law  of  Accounting  and  other  decrees  of  the  government. 14  Each  of  the  30 \nsubordinate entities under the holding company prepares its own financial report, and these are \nconsolidated at the holding company level. Barki Tojik has an internal audit unit established at \nthe  head  office,  but  with  limited  independence.  External  independent  auditors  are  engaged  to \nundertake  auditing  based  on  international  auditing  standards  for  the  holding  company  in \ncompliance with the statutory requirements.15 \n \n27. \nSubstantial efforts are being made to strengthen the financial management capacity.  In \n2011,  the  government  has  initiated  a  comprehensive  program  to  restructure  Barki  Tojik.  The \nsector operational performance improvement (SOPI) program is extensively supported by ADB \nto  improve  commercial  operations  and  financial  performance  of  the  utility  and  strengthen  its \ncapacity  to  service  debt  while  providing  high-quality  services. 16  It  includes  institutional \nstrengthening  and  reorganization  of  Barki  Tojik  using  a  phased  approach  (phase  1  involves \nsector  assessment,  phase  2  preparation  of  a  detailed  restructuring  plan,  and  phase  3  the \nrestructuring  itself).  The  program  addresses  governance,  financial  management,  control  and \naudit, legal and regulatory frameworks, management systems, and organizational structure. The \nprogram  also  addresses  technical  operations  and  planning  to  optimize  the  future  investments \nand  allocate  sufficient  funds  for  system  maintenance.  On  11  June  2013,  the  government \napproved (i) the assessment report prepared under the SOPI program; (ii) the intervention plan \nprepared by the SOPI program consultant; and (iii) the new structure of Barki Tojik, with three \ndepartments  under  the  same  legal  entity  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution).  New \nheads  of  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  departments  were  appointed  on  28 \nAugust  2013.  Preparation  of  the  detailed  restructuring  plan  is  ongoing  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted in December 2013. \n \n28. \nSeparately,  Barki  Tojik  is  in  the  process  of  recruiting  international  consultants  to \nrevaluate assets in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and assess \nissues related to account receivables and payables. The project is funded by the World Bank.17 \nAutomated accounting and billing system are being introduced, starting in major cities such as \nDushanbe and Khujand. Continued effort is needed to steadily increase the tariff level, improve \ntariff  collection  efficiency  through  the  adoption  of  computerized  accounting  and  reporting \nsystems,  and  modernize  and  rehabilitate  productive  assets  through  investment.  It  is  expected \n\n                                                \n13  External audit of Barki Tojik by independent auditors has resulted in a disclaimer of opinion for FY 2010\u20132012.  \n14 Government\u2019s  Decree  428  of  4  November  2002  for  \u201cInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards\u201d;  Government\u2019s \nDecree  231  of  2  May  2010  for  \u201cAdditional  Arrangements  for  Implementing  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards in the Republic of Tajikistan\u201d; and President\u2019s Decree 702 of 25 March 2011 for the \u201cLaw of Accounting.\u201d  \n15 President\u2019s Decree 626 for the \u201cLaw on Financial Management and Internal Control\u201d; and President\u2019s Decree 631 \n\nfor the \u201cLaw on Internal Audit.\u201d  \n\n16 ADB.  2010.

Tajikistan. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8       \n\nthat  there  will  be  positive  changes  in  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  accounting  procedures,  financial  reporting, \nand management reporting systems in 2014\u20132016. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nA reliable supply of electricity brings significant benefits to communities (especially those \nthat  are  poor),  including  enhanced  incomes  and  livelihoods,  improved  health  and  education, \nbetter  security,  and  a  generally  higher  standard  of  living.  In  Tajikistan  the  winter  months  are \nparticularly difficult for those who lack a reliable supply of electricity, and cannot afford adequate \nalternatives. Women  in  particular  will  benefit  from  the  project  because  of  their  household  and \nfamily responsibilities, including gathering fuel for cooking, heating, and processing water; and \ncaring  for  children,  the  sick,  and  the  elderly.  Electricity  also  offers  women  many  more \nopportunities  for  home-based  enterprise  and  income  generation,  and  has  positive  impacts  on \npublic facilities such as schools and health centers.  \n \n30. \nHowever, because this project will refurbish electrical and mechanical equipment at the \nhydropower  plant,  which  will  then  supply  electricity  to  the  entire  grid,  the  benefits  (although \nsubstantial)  are  generalized  and  indirect,  and  do  not  target  particular  communities.  Similarly, \nthere  will  not  be  specific  power-supply  benefits  for  the  area  surrounding  the  Golovnaya  plant, \nnor  for  particular  social  groups  such  as  women  or  the  poor,  beyond  those  that  accrue  to \nelectricity  consumers  in  general.  The  technological  nature  of  the  project  allows  little  scope for \nsocial components, and the project provides no opportunities for pro-poor initiatives.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environmental  impacts.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and environmental compliance audit report prepared by Barki \nTojik  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Anticipated  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  project  are  related  to  temporary  shortages  of  electricity  supplies \ndue  to  replacement  of  generating  units,  solid  waste  utilization,  and  health  and  safety  issues. \nAdequate  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  will  be \nimplemented  through  an  environmental  management  plan.  The  IEE  includes  provisions  for \nincreasing the safeguards capacity of the PMU. The environmental management plan stipulates \nthat an environmental management development program for Golovnaya hydropower plant staff \nwill be implemented through training workshops at the preconstruction and construction stages. \nA  public  consultation  was  conducted  on  6  September  2013.  The  IEE  and  the  environmental \ncompliance audit report were disclosed on the ADB website on 20 September 2013. A climate \nchange  risk  assessment  will  be  conducted  during  pre-construction  phase  to  identify  operation \nand maintenance measures aimed at increasing the climate resilience of the hydropower plant. \n \nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts are not envisaged, because all activities will \n32. \nbe  confined  to  the  power  plant  premises;  therefore  a  category  C  classification  has  been \nassigned  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.  Because  the \nfacility  was  commissioned  in  1962  and  has  existed  and  been  operational  since  then,  a  social \ncompliance  audit  for  the  existing  facility  was  undertaken  to  determine  if  there  are  outstanding \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues;  the  social  compliance  audit  confirmed  there  are  no \noutstanding or remaining issues. \n \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.18  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nTransportation of large and heavy \nequipment to Golovnaya Hydropower \nPlant and risk of equipment damage in \ntransit \nManufactured equipment does not fit \nduring installation, resulting in delays \nand claims \nDelay in project implementation and \ncost overruns \n\nRisk of flood  \n\nStaffing deficiencies and insufficient \ncapacity of Barki Tojik and PMU to \nmanage procurement and contract \nadministration \n\nWeak financial management, funds \nflow, accounting procedures and \naudits \n \n\nOperation and maintenance  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nBid documents will specify that the contract include a \ndetailed transportation logistics plan, and that goods be \ninsured from point of origin to installation onsite. \n\nThe bid documents will clearly define responsibility, and \nsufficient time will be allocated for the turnkey contractor to \ntake measurements before manufacture. \nThe PMU has experience with similar projects. The project \nimplementation consultant will supervise installation, manage \ncontracts and finances, and monitor environmental programs \nand report. Bid documents will envisage lump sum payment \nwith significant penalties for late completion. \nThe project implementation schedule will take into account \nannual fluctuation in water flow to minimize flood risk during \nthe rehabilitation works. \nADB\u2019s SOPI consultants will address staffing deficiencies \nthrough extensive training. Separately SOPI program \nconsultant under the Tajikistan Regional Power \nTransmission Project a will be assisting in the recruitment of \nthe implementation consultant and turnkey contractor. The \nimplementation consultant will be actively involved with the \nproject after the contract award. \nADB\u2019s SOPI program consultant under the Tajikistan \nRegional Power Transmission Projecta will assist Barki Tojik \nin corporate restructuring to improve the efficiency of utility \noperations. Restructuring will be further supported by the \nWorld Bank\u2019s program addressing the introduction of IFRS, \nasset valuation, receivables, and billing. These measures will \nresult in improved financial management, including allocation \nof maintenance funds. The direct payment and letter of \ncommitment methods will be used, with no imprest account.  \nThe project implementation consultants in conjunction with \nBarki Tojik staff will develop a plant operation and \nmaintenance plan that will be approved by Barki Tojik \nmanagement before commissioning of the first rehabilitated \nunit.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFRS = international financial reporting standards, PMU = project management \nunit, SOPI = sector operational performance improvement. \na  ADB.  2010.
