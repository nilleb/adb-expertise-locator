The  project  locations  are \nChaungzon  Island,  Kyaikhto,  Mawlamyine,  and  Mudon,  four  townships  in  Mon  State.  The \nproject  comprises  an  integrated  approach  to  enable  microentrepreneurs  to  access  technical \ntraining, skills in business management, appropriate technology, finance, and markets to build \ncompetitive and sustainable businesses and contribute to reducing household poverty. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nInclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Myanmar  is  classified  as  a  low  human \ndevelopment  country;  the  2014  Human  Development  Report  ranks  it  150th  of  187  countries.2 \nApproximately 26% of the population lives in poverty. Poverty is gendered, and concentrated in \nrural areas and among some ethnic groups.3 A key objective of the government\u2019s development \nagenda  is  to  attain  sustainable  inclusive  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty  reduction.4  The \ngovernment\u2019s  Framework  for  Economic  and  Social  Reforms  emphasizes  transition  from \npredominantly  low-productive  agriculture  to  higher-value  products  by  promoting  micro,  small, \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  and  trade,  as  one  channel  to  facilitate  inclusive  growth.5  In \nMyanmar, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises account for 90% of all business and are \nthe largest source of employment, accounting for 70% of the total workforce.6 Investing in their \ndevelopment is, therefore, essential for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. \n \n4. \nSelection  of  project  area.  In  Mon  State,  more  than  39%  of  the  population  is \nunderemployed and more than 16% of families are classified as poor; despite rapidly increasing \ntrade  and  tourism  in  the  area.  Approximately  55%  of  the  state\u2019s  population  is  self-employed, \noperating MSEs that sell agricultural products such as processed foods and snacks (e.g., fruit \nand  vegetable  juice,  jams,  and  dried  goods)  and  handicrafts  including  bamboo  and  woven \nproducts  in  nearby  markets.7  However,  these  MSEs  are  constrained  by  low  productivity  and \nmake  limited  contributions  to  reducing  household  poverty,  including  (i)  insufficient  product \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   United Nations Development Programme. 2014. 2014 Human Development Report. Washington, DC. \n3  Poverty  incidence  is  about  twice  as  high  in  rural  (29%)  than  urban  (15%)  areas.  Rural  areas  account  for  almost \n85% of total poverty.

These constraints prevent residents of the state from developing productive enterprises \nthat could supply value-added products to expanding local and regional markets. \n \n5. \nAbout  15%  of  the  2.3  million  Myanmar  nationals  migrating  to  Thailand  in  search  of \nbetter-paying jobs are from Mon State.8 Currently, migrant workers in Thailand remit an annual \ntotal of $1.7 billion nationally, of which more than $588 million is sent to Mon State.9 However, \nthese remittances are mostly used to support basic survival needs; the use of these funds for \ninvestment  and  other  productive  purposes  would  maximize  their  development  impact  and \nsupport poverty reduction for households affected by migration. \n \n6.  \nTourism  in  Mon  State  has  strong  potential  for  growth.  The  project  site  near  Kyaikthiyo \n(the  Golden  Rock  Pagoda)  is  one  of  the  top  tourist  destinations  in  Myanmar,  with  more  than  \n1 million visitors in 2013.10 Mawlamyine and Mudon, with the country\u2019s largest reclining Buddha, \npagodas,  old  churches,  caves,  and  huge  rock  formations  are  also  increasingly  popular  tourist \nsites.  The  Mon  State  government  plans  to  promote  these  areas  for  cultural  and  community-\nbased  tourism  development.  It  recently  mobilized  significant  private  investment  for  new  hotels \nand  tourist  facilities.  These  opportunities,  together  with  improved  connectivity  resulting  from \nupgrades to  the  EWEC will  result  in a sharp increase in international  tourism  and trade in the \nproposed project areas.11 \n \n7. \nLocal resources for employment and livelihood generation. The project will support \nlocal  producers  of  agricultural  products  and  handicrafts  to  access  income-generation  and \nemployment opportunities associated with this new consumer market, as well as facilitate their \naccess to established local and tourist markets in Mon, Yangon, and at the Myawaddy\u2013Mae Sot \nborder.  The  project  interventions  are  designed  to  boost  microenterprise  development  and \nrelated  job  creation  that  is  pro-poor  and  led  by  women,  through  investments  in  technical \ntraining,  capacity  development  for  business  development  and  management  skills,  and  small \ninfrastructure  to  support  access  to  processing  technology  and  markets.  Support  to  strengthen \nlocal government and key stakeholder capacity and institutional arrangements will improve the \nbusiness-enabling environment. \n \n8. \nAlignment with government plans and ADB strategy. The project is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s  priority  to create jobs  and  generate  income  to  reduce  poverty,  as  highlighted  in \nthe Framework for Economic and Social Reforms, 2012\u20132015 and the National Comprehensive \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132031. It is consistent with the interim country partnership strategy of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Myanmar,  2012-2014  (extended  to  2016),  which \n\n                                                \n8  Many of the migrants are males who leave behind females to head the households.

Manila. The road improvements will ensure a good road network stretching \nfrom  Myawaddy  on  the  Thai  border  and  linking  it  to  Hpa-an  (in  Kayin),  Kyaikhto  and  Mawlamyine  (in  Mon),  and \nYangon by 2018. \n\n\ffocuses  on  inclusive  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  support  for  rural  livelihoods.12  The \nproject is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Myanmar.13 It will complement \nother ADB assistance14 and coordinate closely with other development partner interventions.15 \n \nLessons.  Lessons  learnt  from  a  similar  project  in  Cambodia16  highlight  the  need  to  (i) \n9. \nadequately assess market demand for products and services, (ii) involve private sector partners \nearly  and  frontload  business  support  services,  (iii)  involve  both  men  and  women  in  decision-\nmaking  processes,  and  (iv)  provide  adequate  project  implementation  support.  Applying  these \nlessons,  project  preparation  included  a  rapid  value  chain  analysis  to  guide  the  selection  of \nproduct  types  and  project  locations.  Comprehensive  value  chain  analysis  and  market  studies \nwill be completed during the initial stages of project implementation. \n \nReplicable, scalable, and sustainable. The project will demonstrate how to assist local \n10. \nresidents  access  socioeconomic  benefits  resulting  from  the  increasing  number  of  tourists  and \nroad improvements in the EWEC. This will provide a model that can be scaled up in the state \nand  replicated  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  It  will  promote  entrepreneurship  among  migrant \nreturnees  and  \u2015left-behind\u2016  families  of  migrants  through  the  effective  use  of  remittances.  The \nstrengthening of community-based enterprises and implementation of life-skill training programs \nwill  provide  young  men  and  women  with  alternatives  to  unsafe  migration.  Training  on  gender \nequality and life skills is envisaged to promote gender-fair division of resources and labor, and \nwill  create  an  enabling  environment  for  women  to  better  access  livelihood  opportunities.  The \nproject supports infrastructure improvements to connect lower-income groups with markets, and \nenable lower-educated residents to access training and salaried employment. Capacity building \nof institutions responsible for MSE development with parallel support to project beneficiaries to \nengage in all stages of the value chain will enhance the sustainability of project outputs. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact is aligned with the government\u2019s priority to create jobs and generate income \n11. \nto reduce poverty. The outcome  will  be  MSEs  are  enabled  to  increase business  activities  and \nemployment in project areas. \n \nC. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Skills  and  management  capacity  of  micro  and  small  enterprises  and \ntheir  employees  developed.  This  output  will  (i)  conduct  value  chain  and  market  studies  to \nidentify the crafts and local foods to be supported; (ii) design and implement training programs \nto improve existing, and create new product lines based on the foundation studies; and (iii) train \nmaster  trainers  from  existing  training  bodies  (vocational  training  institutes,  government \n                                                \n12  ADB.  2012,  extended  in  2014.

The  project  will  support  900  households  to  access  livelihood  and  employment  in  \n12  villages  in  Chaungzon,  Kyaikhto,  Mawlamyine,  and  Mudon  townships,  in  Mon  State.17 \nCriteria  used  to  select  the  project  location  and  beneficiaries  include  (i)  villages  have  poverty \nrates  of  at  least  16%;  (ii)  communities  have  sufficient  basic  skills  to  produce  crafts  and  food \nproducts; (iii) at least 75% of products selected will be produced mainly by women in enterprises \nled  by  women;  (iv)  market  demand  for  the  type  of  products  that  can  be  produced  in  target \nvillages has been proven; and (v) participation in the project is endorsed by community leaders, \nwomen producers, and intended project recipients. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Access  to  business  services,  credit,  and  commercial  networks \nstrengthened.  This  output  will  identify  input  suppliers,  business  development  training  service \nproviders, microfinance providers, and the feasibility of credit access and commercial networks \nto strengthen market linkages. It will develop training courses and deliver training  to MSEs on \nbusiness  development,  management,  and  accounting  that  culminate  in  individual  business \nplans.  Activities  will  strengthen  the  access  of  MSEs  and  retailers  to  affordable  credit  by \nintroducing them to local microfinance institutions, while implementing training modules to train \nMSEs  and  retailer  groups  to  create  independent  savings  and  credit  groups.  Support  for \nparticipation  in  trade  fairs  and  business-matching  workshops  will  strengthen  commercial \nnetworks  involving  MSEs,  suppliers,  wholesalers,  and  retail  outlets  and  markets  in  Mon  and \nYangon. Support to develop a \u2015Made in Mon, Myanmar\u2016 brand, product design competitions for \ninnovative  handicrafts,  and  related  marketing  and  promotion  programs  will  increase  market \nawareness of products produced in the project area. \n \n15.   Output  3:  Infrastructure  to  support  access  to  markets  and  processing  facilities \nimproved. This  component  will  provide  retailers and traders  with a custom-built  public market \nfacility18 in Mawlamyine and a multifunction processing center in Kyaikhto. Both facilities will be \noperated under public\u2013private\u2013community partnership models to promote local ownership while \nensuring effective management and long-term financial sustainability. This output will (i) develop \na  local  product  and  craft  market  with  amenities  in  Mawlamyine,  including  directional  signage \nand  vehicle  parking;  and  (ii)  establish  a  market  management  committee  comprising  local \ncommunity  members,  retailers,  small-scale  producers,  and  local  government  authorities.  A \nsocial  enterprise  managed  by  the  private  sector  or  a  civil  society  organization  with  relevant \nexperience  is  expected  to  operate  the  market  under  a  public\u2013private\u2013community  partnership \nmanagement  agreement.  A  vendor  association  will  be  established  to  enhance  the  bargaining \npower  of  women,  poor  producers,  and  retailers  to  leverage  collective  interests  in  market \noperations.  Establishment  of  the  multifunction-processing  center  will  provide  producers  with \nsuitable  space  for  hygienic  processing,  packaging,  and  distributing  food  and  handicrafts  to \ntraders.  A  management  committee  will  be  established  comprising  producers  and  local \ngovernment representatives who may partner with a private or social enterprise to manage the \nfacility  (public\u2013private\u2013community  partnership  agreement).  Suitable  processing  equipment  will \nbe provided based on need.  \n \n16. \nInitial operation and maintenance (O&M) plans for the market and processing facility are \nincluded  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).19  In  addition,  detailed  O&M  plans  will  be \nprepared during implementation to ensure sustainability and financing of incremental recurrent \ncosts.  This  output  will  provide  direct  employment  for  vendors,  vendor  employees,  site \n\n                                                \n17 Training will also be provided to the unemployed, especially women and the poor. \n18 Accessibility of the market to women owned MSEs and retailers will be a key criterion.  \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fmanagers,  and  maintenance  staff  in  markets.

MOHT will be the executing agency and the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM) \nfor  Mon  State  will  be  the  implementing  agency. Overall  project  management  and coordination \nwill  be  led  by  the  PMU  embedded  in  MOHT.  The  implementing  agency  will  establish  a  PIU \nstaffed with multidisciplinary teams to oversee day-to-day project implementation. The PIU will \nreport  to  the  OCM  for  Mon  State  and  to  the  PMU,  which  will  coordinate  quarterly  project \nprogress reports for submission to members of the national steering committee and ADB. The \nPMU  and  PIU  will  share  consultant  resources  and  attend  all  steering  committee  meetings  to \nensure  project  activities  are  well  coordinated.  The  project  will  work  directly  with  communities, \ncivil  society  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders,  which  will  appoint  focal  points  to  ensure \ngood coordination between the PIU and project beneficiaries. Budget is allocated for the project \nimplementation and coordination costs for both the PMU and the PIU. The PMU will establish an \nimprest account with a subaccount in the PIU. The government will provide project staff capable \nof using standard government accounting and financial management systems. \n \n23. \nConsultants  and  other  service  providers  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) to support project \nimplementation.  They  will  provide  capacity  building,  research,  training,  and  other  services  to \nachieve the project\u2019s intended targets and ensure that safeguard issues are properly dealt with. \nThe PMU and PIU will procure goods, civil works, and other contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nTechnical \n\nA. \n \nThe selection of MSEs and product lines for the project are based on sound value chain \n24. \nanalysis  and  market  studies.20  Project-support  for  processing  technology  and  infrastructure \nconsiders  cost,  durability,  affordability,  and  climate  resilience,  and  is  compatible  with  local \ncapacity  for  O&M.  Civil  works  will  follow  standard  design  parameters.  Contract  packaging  will \ninclude  relevant  technical  standards  and  specifications  to  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications and ensure efficient procurement. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe economic analysis for the project was undertaken in accordance with the principles \nand  procedures  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.22  The \neconomic  benefits  quantified  are  (i)  incremental  income  of  existing  producers,  retailers,  and \ntraders due to enhanced capacity; (ii) incremental income of new employment generated by the \nproject; and (iii) economic benefits from the construction of a market facility estimated by using \nwillingness-to-pay of vendors as a proxy indicator of the benefits.23 The economic costs include \n\nEconomic and Financial21 \n\n                                                \n20 Initial value chain assessment identified the following product lines: (a) Processed foods: jams, dried fruits, pickles, \nsauces and pastes; and (b) Handicrafts: (i) tobacco pipes (ii) decorative walking sticks, (iii) wooden jewelry boxes \n(iv) cane baskets, wallets, carry bags, flip flops and toys (v) bamboo baskets and furniture (vi) longyis. \n\n21  Cash  flow  analysis provided in  Table 1  in  Appendix  2  of  PAM  (footnote  19)  shows  that  the  market  will  generate \nsufficient revenue for the operation and maintenance costs. Detailed financial analysis will be undertaken as part of \nmarket feasibility study during implementation.  \n\n22  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n23  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finvestment costs for infrastructure, training and project management, and O&M. The economic \nanalysis yields an estimated net present value of $0.17 million and an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 13%, assuming a discount rate of 12%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project \nis  most  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  incremental  income  and  increase  in  investment  cost. \nTherefore,  mitigation  actions  focus  on  ensuring  all  capacity  development  activities  for  the \ntargeted beneficiaries will lead to a high economic return. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n26. \nThe  financial  management  risk  without  mitigation  is  assessed  as  substantial.  Identified \nrisks include the country public financial management environment, lack of capacity in financial \nreporting,  weaknesses  in  the  internal  audit  function,  and  outdated  accounting  policies  and \nprocedures. However, MOHT has previous experience in implementing ADB-financed technical \nassistance,  administering  other  development  partner  assistance,  and  managing  the  regular \ngovernment  budget.  Furthermore,  measures  to support  procurement  oversight  and  strengthen \nfinancial management skills have been prepared to avoid potential problems. These include (i) \nthe  application  of  standard  ADB  bidding  procedures;  (ii)  capacity  building  and  training \nassistance  for  financial  management  and  procurement  under  output  4;  (iii)  establishment  of \nsuitable accounting systems; and (iv) embedding of long-term consultants in the PMU and PIU \nto  provide  on-the-job  training  for  project  staff  and  counterparts.  Review  missions  and  regular \nproject  support  will  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  external  audit \nrequirements.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and MOHT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  19).  Implementation  of  these  risk  management \nmeasures will ensure that financial management arrangements are adequate. An assessment of \nthe  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  capacity  to  undertake  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement envisaged under the project, including the imprest fund procedure, concludes that \nthe proposed implementing arrangements are appropriate. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  900  households  in  the  four  participating  project  towns. \nThe  project  will  support  local  entrepreneurs,  in  particular  women,  to  access  livelihoods  and \nemployment. The project will provide technical training together with business development and \nmanagement  skills  to  MSEs,  and  facilitate  their  access  to  finance,  markets,  and  business \nsupport services. This will support the establishment of productive businesses or expansion into \nhigher-value  production  in  profitable  and  emerging  sectors.  Since,  in  Myanmar  poverty  has \nmuch  more  to  do  with  low  returns  from  work  rather  than  simply  access  to  work,  these \ninterventions will help increase the returns and income for  many microentrepreneurs operating \nin the area and provide economic opportunities to benefit poor and low-income households. The \nproject  is  categorized  as  gender  equity.  It  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  economic \nopportunities and decision making. The gender action plan ensures, among others, that at least \n60% of the (i) members of producer groups are female, (ii) newly developed enterprises will be \nowned by women, (iii) women producers and retailers have access to credit, and (iv) community \nmembers employed for the project-supported infrastructure are women. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  It \n28. \nwill  not  support  any  activities  that  require  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  land  for  the \nmarket  will  be  vacant,  unused,  and  unoccupied  land,  to  be  identified  and  provided  by  the \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\fgovernment  and  project  beneficiaries.  The  project  will  not  entail  any  land  acquisition.  Where \nland  is  available,  it  will  be  free  from  encumbrances,  and  have  no  past  or  existing  land  and \nresettlement  issues  in  regard  to  existing  facilities.  The  PIU  will  ensure  this  by  completing  a \nsocial  safeguard  screening  checklist  for  construction  of  each  infrastructure  component.  The \nassigned PMU staff and consultants will confirm the checklists prior to submission for financing. \n \n29. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  It  focuses \nprimarily  on  training  and  capacity  building  for  the  rural  poor,  who  are  overwhelming  ethnic \nminorities.  The  presence  of  many  ethnic  minorities  as  primary  beneficiaries  in  the  project\u2019s \ntarget  areas meets  the  criteria  of  integration  of  indigenous  peoples  plan  elements  into  project \ndesign in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009). No specific targets  are \nset  for  the  indigenous  people  group  participation.  Interviews  and  consultations  with  affected \nindigenous  people  communities\u2014producers,  retailers,  and  owners  of  MSEs\u2014were  conducted \nand their support for improvements in the value chain gained. Consultation and participation will \nbe  continued  throughout  the  project  cycle  to  ensure  their  involvement  in  access  to  finance, \ntraining,  and  other  project  activities.  The  indigenous  people  groups  are  already  producing  the \nhandicrafts  and  the  project  will  support  improvements  in  the  value  chain.  A  consultation  and \nparticipation summary is included as part of the project documentation.24 \n \n30.   Environment. The project is classified category C, at this stage, in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  proposed  activities  are  likely  to  have  minimal  or  no \nadverse  environmental  impacts,  however,  in  the  event  that  the  project  involves  any \nenvironmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures  for  any  identified  impacts  are  included  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework.25  Initial  estimated  costs  for  developing  and \nimplementing the environmental management plan (EMP) are integrated in the project costs. At \nthe detailed design stage, the EMP will be updated and finalized, and the categorization of the \nproject  confirmed.  The  final  EMP,  cleared  by  ADB,  will  form  part  of  the  contract  bidding \ndocuments. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements, the \nsafeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. Procurement of applicable government \nenvironment clearances and approvals will be obtained before award of contract. A designated \nPMU  official  responsible for  environment  issues  will  ensure  safeguard monitoring  and/or  EMP \nimplementation.26 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  integrated  benefits and impacts  of  the  project  are expected to outweigh the  costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are  summarized  in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n\nRisks \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nControl of the procurement process and supervision of the quality \nof the work or services delivered will take place through the \nsupport of consultants. \n\nFiduciary risks include contracting \nfor national competitive bidding on \nequipment and civil works-related \ninvestments. \n\nInternational accounting standards \n\nThe Office of Auditor General (OAG) is included in the approved \n\n                                                \n24 Value Chain Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The roles and responsibilities are detailed in the PAM (Footnote 19) and/or in the EMP. \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRCDTA: Enhancing Roles of Supreme Audit Institution in Selected \nASEAN Countries.
