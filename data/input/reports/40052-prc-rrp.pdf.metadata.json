A summary of the environmental impact assessment \nAssessment  was circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of \nDirectors and uploaded onto the ADB website on 26 June 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  is  a  key  urban  infrastructure  initiative  of  Kunming \nmunicipal government (KMG). It will provide safe, secure water \nsupply  and  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  of  the  city  of \nKunming. The Project will help Kunming to (i) ensure better raw \nwater  quantity  and  quality  in  the  main  city  and  the  new \ndevelopment zones; (ii) protect water resources; (iii) encourage \nmore  effective  water  demand  management;  (iv)  strengthen \nintegrated  water  resources  development  and  environmental \nmanagement; (v) improve the environment, living conditions, and \npublic  health  standards;  and  (vi)  ensure  effective  corporate \ngovernance and enterprise reform to improve sector efficiency.  \n \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components  (i)  water  resources \ndevelopment,  (ii)  water  conveyance  systems,  and  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment and project management. The Project supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program  (2006\u20132010)  to  improve \nliving conditions and health in the cities of the PRC, and to promote \ntheir  sustainable  economic  development.  The  Project  will \ncontribute to achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7, \ntarget 10, which calls for halving by 2015 the proportion of people \nwithout access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The \nProject is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n   \nRationale  Yunnan provincial government and KMG have identified a priority \nlist of investment projects covering water supply and wastewater \nmanagement  and  environmental  improvement  projects  that  will \nhelp to improve the urban environment, reduce water pollution of \nreservoirs  and  lakes,  and  ensure  long-term  sustainable \ndevelopment in Kunming. In the medium term, a better quality and \nlow-cost  water  supply  source  is  needed  to  meet  the  projected \nwater demand of Kunming. Without these measures, Kunming will \nhave to revert to the use of the highly polluted water sources of \nDianchi Lake with class V water quality. The polluted water source \nremains a threat to public health, apart from being costly to treat. \n ", "ii \nTo support these developments, additional raw water supplies are \nrequired. The existing water supply, without using Dianchi Lake, is \nprojected to be fully utilized within the existing city because of \npopulation  growth  and  the  related  urban,  commercial,  and \nindustrial  development  through  to  2010  and  beyond.  The  New \nAirport  Development  Zone  (NADZ)  is  a  new  greenfield \ndevelopment  area  that  has  no  substantial  local  water  supply \nsource. Because of topography, it can only be supplied with water \nfrom the existing city system by pumping, which is contrary to the \nexpressed policy for energy saving. NADZ will be developed from \n2007 onwards, to have a projected population of 70,000 in 2010 \nand 180,000 in 2020. Development of the East Development Zone \n(EDZ) has already started, but the provision of adequate water \nsupply will soon be a significant constraint as the population grows \nto 390,000 by 2010, and 950,000 by 2020. \n \nKMG  has  accorded  priority  in  its  11th  Five-Year  Program  to \naddressing  water  scarcity  through  policy  reform,  increased \ninvestment,  and  improved  water  and  urban  infrastructure \nmanagement. KMG\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) protecting drinking \nwater sources by controlling upstream water pollution, industrial \npollution, and other point and nonpoint sources in urban areas; \n(ii) support  to  watershed  protection  and  management; \n(iii) introducing  water  and  energy  efficient  technologies  and \noperations;  and  (iv)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to \nencourage water conservation and generate the necessary funds \nfor  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs,  KMG \nhas  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  water  supply  and  wastewater \nprojects are financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \n \nThe Project will address the critical water requirements of KMG \nbeyond 2012. The Project will provide 111 million cubic meters \n(m3)  of  water  annually  to  meet  the  demand  of  Kunming  city, \n104 million m3 for EDZ and NADZ, and 7 million m3 for Xundian \nCounty  from  2012.  In  both  zones,  residents  currently  depend \nlargely on water from springs and wells to supply water to their \nhomes by village-level systems for domestic use.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is improved urban environment, public \nhealth,  and  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  of  Kunming;  and \nsustained economic development of the city through the provision \nof safe and reliable water supply. The outcome of the Project is the \nprovision of more efficient, reliable, affordable, safe, and clean raw \nwater supply; and effective protection and management of water \nresources in Kunming (contributing to the achievement of MDG 7, \ntarget 10).  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The total project cost is estimated at $255.9 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties. \n   ", "iii \nFinancing Plan   \nAmount \n  ($ million  Percent \nSource  equivalent) \nAsian Development Bank  80.0  31.3 \nKunming Municipal Government  76.8  30.0 \nLocal Bank   99.1  38.7 \n  Total  255.9  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe Government has requested a loan of $80 million to finance \nabout  31.3%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Provincial  and  municipal \ngovernments  will  provide  equity  equivalent  to  $76.8  million,  or \n30.0% of total project cost. The balance of $99.1 million (38.7%) \nwill be provided by a domestic loan from the Agricultural Bank of \nChina. The ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources. \nThe loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate for US dollar loans, a \ncommitment charge of 0.35% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan \nwill have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. \n   \nAllocation and  The  Government  of  the  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to \nRelending Terms  Yunnan  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds to KMG, on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan. The loan proceeds will then be onlent to Kunming \nWater Supply Group Company Limited (KWSG) on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A  project  leading  group  (PLG)  will  be  responsible  for  project \nArrangements  coordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during \nimplementation. Headed by the vice mayor, the PLG will comprise \nrepresentatives from municipal government agencies and county \ngovernments.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been \nestablished  within  Kunming  Development  and  Reform \nCommission. It will serve as the secretariat of the PLG and will be \nresponsible for coordinating implementation of project activities. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Kunming Municipal Government \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nContracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts \nfor works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for \ngoods and contracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than \n ", "iv \nthe ICB values, but more than $100,000, will be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the \nPRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost \n$100,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Provision  has  been  made  for  about  18  person-months  of \ninternational and 72 person-months of national consulting services, \nto  be  funded  under  the  Project  to  support  the  PMO  and \nimplementing  agency  in  project  implementation  and  capacity \ndevelopment. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in \naccordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nusing full technical proposal procedures. A fixed quality-cost ratio \nof  80:20  will  be  applied.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  (i) \nproject  management  and  construction  supervision;  (ii) \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  setup  of  project \nperformance  management  system;  (iii) safeguards  management \nand  monitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and  business  planning;  (v)  tariff \nreview; (vi) dam and reservoir management, safety, and operation; \n(vii) online water quality monitoring; and (viii) development of public \nawareness training on water demand measures and social impact \nmonitoring.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  MDG  for \nBeneficiaries  environmental  sustainability  (Goal  7),  which  aims  to  halve  the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater and basic sanitation by 2015 (target 10). The Project will \ndirectly benefit about 3.4 million people living in the project areas, \nof whom about 6.9% are poor. All the residents of Kunming will \nbenefit indirectly, as their living conditions will improve as a result \nof (i) improved water quality and quantity; (ii) improved security of \nwater supply, which will mean less likelihood of rationing in drought \nyears; (iii) reduced use of polluted water sources; and (iv) reduced \nincidence of waterborne diseases and the associated reduction in \nmedical  costs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  lead  to  employment \ncreation  during  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities. \nHealth  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by \nwomen and children. Value-added features include supporting an \nenabling environment for the joint venture between KWSG and \nVeolia  for  water  treatment  and  distribution  in  Kunming  through \nensuring  KMG\u2019s  stricter  enforcement  of  \u201cone  household,  one \nmeter\u201d  policy,  and  supporting  KMG  to  move  towards  uniform \nnondomestic tariffs and to continue to monitor the price subsidies \nand lifeline tariff to cushion the impact of tariff increases on the \npoor. Further, the Project shall undertake corporate governance \nreform through the introduction of water users\u2019 representative in \nthe  board  of  directors  of  KWSG,  and  improving  managerial \ncapacity  of  KWSG  in  dam/reservoir  management,  safety,  and \noperation.  The  Project  will  implement  capacity  development  of ", "v \nKWSG  on  financial  management  and  project  performance \nmanagement  system,  safeguards  management  and  monitoring, \ncorporate and business planning, tariff review, dam and reservoir \nmanagement, safety and operation, online water quality monitoring \nand  public  awareness  on  water  demand  measures,  and  social \nimpact monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  for  about  4,200  people  in \nconstruction  work  each  year  for  5  years,  and  an  additional \n10,920 people will be employed annually in jobs created indirectly \nas a result of construction. It is estimated that at least 50% of the \nconstruction jobs will be unskilled, and the poor should benefit \ndisproportionately from this job creation. The Project will contribute \nto  the  prevention  of  up  to  an  estimated  1.5  million  cases  of \nwaterborne  diseases  from  2013  to  2020,  and  the  associated \nincrease in median medical costs is estimated to be likely to rise \nfrom CNY18 to CNY30 per capita (at current values) by 2020. \nHealth  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by \nwomen since they are more at risk of waterborne diseases, and by \nchildren, who have least resistance to such diseases.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  no  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional \nengineering designs with proven records of safety and reliability \nwill be adopted for water storage and transfer (tunneling) systems. \nDuring  project  implementation,  consultants  and  dam  technical \nspecialists  will  support  the  PMO  and  implementing  agency  to \nensure that equipment and works comply with design requirements \nand quality standards. Further, the Yunnan Design and Research \nInstitute is now undertaking substantive on-ground and subsurface \nsurveys to quantify the potential risks more fully prior to finalizing \nthe conveyance system alignment. \n \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and \neconomic viability, and reduce the intended benefits of the Project: \n(i)  failure  to  implement  the  projects  on  water  treatment  and \nwastewater treatment plant capacity within the new development \nzones by the time of project completion/commissioning; (ii) failure \nof  KMG  to  prevent  groundwater  use  completely  to  utilize \nQingshuihai water supply fully as soon as it becomes available \n(given the additional capital costs of Qingshuihai water, and if this \nwill not be fully utilized, this would put pressure on tariffs to cover \ndebt servicing); (iii) failure of KMG to increase tariffs to meet the \ncost recovery targets, considering the impact of comprehensive \nsector investments; and (iv) failure of KMG to undertake detailed \nstudies and surveys on catchment areas and formulate regulations \nfor the Project\u2019s water resources protection.  \n \nRisk (i) will be mitigated through assurances from KMG on the \nprovision of the water treatment and wastewater treatment plant \ncapacities  to  coordinate  with  project  implementation  and \ncommissioning.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  \n ", "vi \nassurances  from  KMG  on  improving  control  and  regulation  of \ngroundwater use, imposing additional charges on groundwater use \nin  excess  of  water  tariffs  to  discourage  groundwater  use,  and \nregular tariff reviews and adjustments. Risk (iv) will be mitigated \nthrough assurance that KMG shall develop a pollution inventory, \nand establish a catchment modeling system, which will form the \nbasis for prioritization of Qingshuihai reservoir protection options \nand development of an environmental monitoring program.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply Project.  \n \n2.  In line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of improving living conditions, providing \nsafe and reliable water supply, protecting water resources, and enhancing effective water demand \nmanagement, the Government of the PRC (the Government) requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) assistance in implementing the water resource development project in Kunming. The Project \nis consistent with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) (2006\u20132010), ADB\u2019s water policy,1 and \nwill help the PRC to achieve Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7, target 10, which calls for \nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and improved \nsanitation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the PRC initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has \naccompanied high levels of economic growth. The urban population has nearly tripled from about \n190 million in 1980 to more than 560 million in 2005, and accounts for more than 43% of the \nnational population. Urbanization increased 1.4% annually from 2001 to 2005 and it is projected \nthat the urban population will reach 45% of the total population by 2010, 49% by 2015, and 55% by \n2020. Urban growth and industrialization will considerably increase the need for water supply and \nsanitation services, and the investments required to provide these services. The growing need for \nbasic  urban  services  resulting  from  urban  population  increase,  rapid  industrialization,  and \neconomic development is increasingly constraining the physical and financial capacity of most \ncities to provide adequate water infrastructure for delivery of a clean and safe water supply.   \n \n4.  Many cities are facing challenges related to managing resource scarcity and environmental \nconcerns. Recognizing the impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment, the Government has \nsupported environmentally sustainable development through policy and pricing reforms, increased \ninvestment, and improved urban infrastructure management. It continues to address critical water \nresources constraints and water supply facilities that limit development. The Government has \nemphasized the need for improvement in water resources management, demand management, \nand complementary investment in water-related infrastructure with increasing attention to water \npolicy, planning, management, and conservation. These principles were included in the amended \nNational Water Law, 2002; Law on Water and Soil Conservation, 1991; and Law on Prevention and \nControl of Water Pollution, 1996.2 \n \n5.  Municipal water supply in PRC cities has increased steadily since 1990s, reaching a service \ncoverage ratio of 64% in 2000 and 91% in 2005. Access to piped water supply in major cities is \nexpected to reach 95% by 2010 and 100% in 2015 in accordance with MDG 7, target 10. However, \nthese high service coverage rates do not reflect the water shortages occurring in most cities \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n2  The National Water Law included the following basic principles: (i) water is a strategic resource and lifeline for social \nand economic development; (ii) the focus needs to be shifted from a construction orientation to a management \norientation; (iii) conserve the quantity and maintain quality of water; (iv) optimize planning/allocation/use, conservation, \nand  protection  of  water  rather  than  maximum  utilization;  (v)  combine  structural  and  nonstructural  measures; \n(vi) increase demand management, and not entirely depend on supply augmentation; (vii) treat water as an economic \ngood and price it accordingly; (viii) establish a functioning water rights and discharge control system; (ix) people need \nto live in harmony with nature and not only exploit it; and (x) place more emphasis on comprehensive integrated water \nresources management. ", "2 \ncaused by lack of good quality raw water, inefficiencies in water distribution, and inadequacy in \nwastewater management and treatment capacities. Currently, two thirds of all PRC cities do not \nhave enough water all year round. Supply is not keeping pace with increasing demand caused by \nrapid  urbanization,  shortage  of  available  water  resources,  increasing  water  pollution,  and \noverextraction of groundwater acquifer. Hence, about 420 out of 651 municipalities have been \nclassified  \u201cwater  short\u201d,  of  which  110  municipalities  have  serious  water  problems  and \n14 municipalities are critically short of water. \n \n6.  The Government has identified the water sector as a priority since 2000 and recognizes the \nwater issues confronting the sector\u2014water shortages, flooding, and water pollution. To address \nwater shortages, the Government has developed a strategy with focus on: (i) developing suitable \nwater sources, (ii) protecting existing water resources by controlling point and nonpoint pollution, \nand (iii) effective water demand management. Overexploitation of groundwater and overuse of \nsurface water has resulted in inadequate environmental flows along with groundwater and surface \nwater pollution contributing to the decline of water resources. Watersheds and upper catchments \nhave been degraded because of pressures from economic activities, resulting in deforestation and \ninadequate  agricultural  and  soil  management  practices.  The  main  challenges  are  to  halt \ngroundwater  overexploitation  and  surface  water  overextraction,  restrict  and  control  pollution, \nincrease the levels of flood protection, and stabilize watersheds. Without a concerted effort to \nimprove water resources management, the damage to the environment will become irreversible, \nwith a substantial negative impact on the quality of life of the people and the economy. \n \n7.  Kunming is the capital city; and the political, economic, and cultural center of Yunnan \nProvince. The city covers a total land area of 21,111 square kilometers (km2) and had a total \npopulation of 5.08 million in 2005 with average annual growth of 6.5% during 2001\u20132005. In 2005, \nKunming\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) reached CNY106.23 billion. Kunming is strategically \nlocated and is a focal point for the PRC\u2019s regional development strategy in the southwestern \nprovinces. In Kunming\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), the strategy is for Kunming to become a \nregional  hub  and  gateway  for  the  PRC\u2019s  trade  and  cultural  relations  with  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Greater Mekong Subregion. Consequently, Kunming city is \nset  for  further  rapid  expansion.  The  current  Kunming  municipal  government  (KMG)  urban \ndevelopment plan3 is centered on revitalization of the old city, with migration of government and \neducation institutions to a new East Development Zone (EDZ) and the establishment of a New \nAirport Development Zone (NADZ).4 Kunming is urbanizing rapidly, and there is growing demand \nfor urban and water infrastructure and services. This has taken its toll on the environment and \nwater supply resources, and has challenged the capacity of KMG to promote good governance, \neffective planning and management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. \n \n8.  The planning and development of  new water  resources has not kept pace with rapid \npopulation and economic growth, particularly in Kunming which is declared a water shortage area. \nThe lack of a cohesive water resources protection and demand management in Kunming, as well \nas widespread pollution, have caused the quality of current water sources to deteriorate to levels \nthat make them unacceptable for further water use. Kunming\u2019s major water sources, Dianchi Lake \nand Songhuaba reservoirs, are experiencing problems with upstream pollution. Dianchi Lake water \n                                                 \n3  Summary of Modern New Kunming Water and Wastewater Master Plan; Medium Term Construction Plan for Kunming \nMain City, 2006\u20132010; Long Term Development Plan for Kunming New Airport Development Zone (NADZ), (2006\u2013\n2020). \n4  EDZ is a new industrial and education zone, with an area of 107 square kilometers (km2) and population of 0.95 \nmillion. NADZ, with an area of 160 km2 and population of 0.40 million, is planned as the regional transport and air \nlogistics hub to link Kunming with ASEAN countries and South Asia.   ", "3 \nis class V5 and needs treatment to meet adequate drinking standards. Songhuaba reservoir is \nbecoming  polluted  from  agricultural  pollutants,  and  the  groundwater  source  is  experiencing \noverextraction. Other reservoirs (Baoxianghe, Chaihe, Dahe, and Shalang) are inadequate to meet \nlocal water demand. Without significant investment in new water resources development and water \nresource protection and management, the quality of life for urban residents will decline, the urban \nenvironment will deteriorate, and the sustainability of economic development will be put at risk. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Project Background. KMG is committed to the development and growth of Kunming as a \nregional economic and communications hub, with close links with member nations of ASEAN and \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  This  growth  will  encourage  further  commercial  activity  and \npopulation increase, leading to an increase in overall water demand in Kunming city. Further, the \nNADZ and Chenggong EDZ, which are integral components of KMG\u2019s \u201cNew Kunming\u201d Master Plan \nthrough to 2030, also need secure and stable water supply. \n \n10.  With increased urbanization, industrialization, and concomitant water shortages, Kunming\u2019s \neconomy will be severely affected without the provision of additional water supply. Hence, KMG, \nsince  1994,  has  identified  and  evaluated  14 water  source  alternatives,  including  the  recently \ncommissioned Zhangjiuhe Water Supply Project (Japan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] \n2002\u20132007), as alternatives to using polluted water from Dianchi Lake. However, even with the \nZhangjiuhe project, and after ceasing the use of Dianchi water, shortage is projected to occur in \nKunming with the new development zones in 2010. KMG would prefer to avoid having to use the \nDianchi water, which is class V and costly to treat to make it suitable for drinking. Further use will \ncontribute to its further environmental decline, as it will reduce the thorough flow of water in the \nLake. By 2010, Kunming will need additional water supply, sufficient for continued growth and \ndevelopment in the future. Among the alternatives evaluated, Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply \nProject, which is gravity-fed and can provide class II water, will address Kunming\u2019s water shortage \nby 2012 and is considered the least-cost option. An analysis of the water sector is in Appendix 2, \nand details are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n11.  Project  Rationale.  Yunnan  provincial  government  (YPG)  and  KMG  have  identified  a \npriority  list  of  investment  projects  covering  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  and \nenvironmental improvement projects that will help to improve the urban environment, reduce water \npollution of reservoirs and lakes, and ensure long-term sustainable development in Kunming. In the \nmedium term, a better quality and low-cost water supply source is needed to meet the projected \nwater demand of Kunming. Without these measures, Kunming will have to revert to the use of the \nhighly polluted water sources of Dianchi Lake with class V water quality. The polluted water source \nremains a threat to public health apart from being costly to treat. \n \n12.  To support these development zones, additional raw water supplies are required. The \nexisting water supply, without using Dianchi Lake, is projected to be fully utilized within the existing \ncity because of population growth and the related urban, commercial, and industrial development \nthrough to 2010 and beyond. The NADZ is a new greenfield development area that has no \nsubstantial local water supply source. Because of topography, it can only be supplied with water \nfrom the existing city system by pumping, which is contrary to the expressed policy for energy \nsaving. The NADZ will be developed from 2007 onwards, to have a projected population of 70,000 \n                                                 \n5  The PRC environmental quality standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is the \nbest in quality and class V is the worst. Class I is for water resources and nationally protected water bodies. Class II is \nfor high-value fish protection areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class I, II, and III can be \nused for potable water resources. Class IV is for general industrial water sources and noncontact recreational areas. \nClass V is suitable only for agricultural use. \n ", "4 \nin 2010 and 180,000 in 2020. Development of the EDZ has already started, but the provision of \nadequate water supply will soon be a significant constraint as the population grows to 390,000 by \n2010, and 950,000 by 2020. \n \n13.  The KMG has accorded priority in its 11th Five-Year Plan to addressing water scarcity \nthrough  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and  improved  water  and  urban  infrastructure \nmanagement.  KMG\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  protecting  drinking  water  sources  by  controlling \nupstream water pollution, industrial pollution, and other point and nonpoint sources in urban areas; \n(ii) support to watershed protection and management; (iii) introducing water and energy efficient \ntechnologies and operations; and (iv) using appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage water \nconservation and generate the necessary funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. In line \nwith the Government\u2019s economic and enterprise reform programs, KMG has taken steps to ensure \nthat water supply and wastewater projects are financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \n \n14.  The Project will address the critical water requirements of KMG beyond 2012. The Project \nwill provide 104 million cubic meters (m3) of water to meet the demand of Kunming city EDZ and \nNADZ, and 7 million m3 for Xundian County from 2012. In both zones, residents currently depend \nlargely on water from springs and wells to supply water to their homes by village-level systems for \ndomestic use.  \n \n15.  To address water scarcity and achieve the water recycling rate of 20% for Kunming to be \ndeclared a National Water Conservation City by 2020,6  KMG is implementing multiple and cross-\nsectoral interventions. These include (i) promoting appropriate technologies for water delivery, \nconservation,  reuse,  pollution  control,  domestic  and  industrial  recycling,  and  rainwater  use; \n(ii) further reduction and eventual restriction on the use of groundwater; (iii) innovative educational \nmeans to motivate present and future users to monitor consumption and conserve water; and \n(iv) formulating  regulations  concerning  the  monitoring  and  management  of  surface  and \ngroundwater, pollution control in water bodies, and incentives for wastewater reuse. It is currently \nimplementing the \u201cone household, one meter\u201d policy, which will enable Kunming Water Supply \nGroup Company Limited (KWSG) to reduce non-revenue water from 38% to 20% by 2015. \n \n16.  Policy Dialogue. Building on policy dialogue with the PRC under previous ADB-funded \nurban development projects, the Project will engage in policy dialogue with KMG in several key \nareas: (i) cost recovery and tariff reforms; (ii) sustainable integrated water resources development, \nprotection, and environmental management; (iii) integrated water resources and water demand \nmanagement;  (iv)  regulatory  enforcement  and  monitoring  for  environmental  management; \n(v) corporate governance and enterprise reform; and (vi) private sector participation (PSP). KMG \nhas endorsed medium- and long-term water supply strategies, and developed master plans and \nenvironmental management programs, including measures on the prevention and control of point \nand nonpoint pollution on water bodies. These plans and programs are formulated to ensure \nsustainable economic development without jeopardizing the environment and living conditions in \nKunming.  \n \n17.  Supporting an integrated approach to urban development and environmental management \nhas been a key element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue and operational activities. Policy dialogue on key \nreforms is a significant aspect of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC, and ADB has supported the tariff \nreform  process  through  three  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  which  have  contributed \n                                                 \n6  The overall targets for the city\u2019s development are for Kunming to become a National Garden City, a Model City for \nEnvironmental Protection, a National Sanitary City, and a Green Kunming. ", "5 \nsignificantly  to  water  and  wastewater  tariff  reforms  and  resources  conservation.7 The  tariff \nguidelines include tariff calculation methodologies that will allow full cost recovery, taking into \nconsideration affordability and social constraints. Further, ADB provided TA support to strengthen \npolicy reform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance PSP in public utilities, and a TA \nto support the water utilities in Nanjing to develop sustainable access to the private long-term \ncapital finance market sector.8  \n \n18.  Kunming is very advanced in incentive and regulatory structures related to tariffs. The \npresent tariff setting mechanism adheres to full cost recovery, and provides a subsidized lifeline \ntariff to the poor up to 6 m3/month and raw water fee made up of a water resource fee of \nCNY0.23/m3 and a water management fee of CNY0.20/m3. The raw water fee is levied on water \nsupplied to the water treatment plant. The water resource fee is used to support compensation to \naffected persons (APs) in the watershed, where adopting environment-friendly farming practices \nwould lead to loss of income. The water management fee of CNY0.20/m3 is transferred to the \nreservoir  operator  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  water  quality  monitoring,  and \nsedimentation control measures to ensure sustainability. The Project will support KMG\u2019s timely \nimplementation of required tariff increases based on the sector\u2019s real cost requirements. \n \n19.  KMG has taken significant steps towards PSP through a joint venture (JV) agreement \nbetween its subsidiary, Kunming CGE Water Supply Company (with 51% equity), and Veolia (49%) \nequity.  The  key  objective  is  to  improve  operational  efficiency  and  service  provision  in \n(i) maintaining  drinking  water  quality  to  national  standards  through  introduction  of  new  water \ntreatment technology; (ii) improving technical and operational efficiency by reducing non-revenue \nwater, metering, increasing connections, and a leakage reduction program; (iii) improved customer \nservice focus; and (iv) improved managerial capacity in financial management, business planning, \nand management information system development. The Project will support KMG to provide an \nenabling  environment  for  the  JV,  including  tariff  reforms  and  regulation,  ensuring  timely \nimplementation  of  required  tariff  increases  based  on  meeting  efficiency  targets  and  service \nstandards, and strict enforcement of the \u201cone household, one meter\u201d policy to promote water \nconservation and effectively reduce system losses. In addition, groundwater licensing and use will \nbe phased out in Kunming by 2012, once Qingshuihai water becomes available.  \n \n20.  The management of water resources and catchment protection in Kunming is currently \ngoverned by regulations on pollution control in and around the reservoirs. KMG undertakes multi-\nlevel and cross-sectoral consultations, detailed surveys, and consensus-building prior to drafting \nwater protection regulations specific to each reservoir. Policy dialogue on developing a watershed \nmanagement  plan  has  been  initiated  during  project  preparation  and  it  was  agreed  that  the \nGovernment will inform ADB on the progress of developing and implementing the plan. To ensure \na more rational allocation and sustainable development of water resources, KMG will explore the \nscope for overall water management administration\u2014integrating water resources, urban and rural \nwater  supply,  water  usage,  wastewater  management,  and  water  conservation  programs,  and \ninstitutional arrangements between and among the municipal and county level agencies. The \npolicy dialogue is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997.

External assistance to KMG in developing and implementing its \nwater supply and environmental infrastructure has come mainly from the World Bank and JBIC. \nThe Project will be the first ADB-financed project in Kunming. Since 1992, ADB has provided 23 \nloans to the PRC, totalling $2.639 billion for urban development and environment projects. ADB \nhas also provided about $44.1 million for more than 67 TAs to prepare projects\u2014to review and \nstudy key issues in water resources management, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, \npollution control, and urban transport. The external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  Lessons. Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in the water sector were considered in policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government,  engineering  design  of  the  project  facilities,  and  capacity \ndevelopment programs. Lessons from previous projects in Kunming city and Yunnan Province \nwere also considered. One of the most important lessons is the need for integration of strategic \nmaster plans with the overall cross-sectoral issues on water, urban, and environment rather than \nas  stand-alone  distinct  documents.  Since  the  Project  covers  water  supply,  extensive  policy \ndialogue is needed with the Government on linking the water supply master plan with the Kunming \ncity  master  plan  with  its  infrastructure  plans  on  water  resource  protection  and  management, \nwastewater, and the master plans on the new development zones. The Project conforms with the \nabove master plans. A second lesson is the importance of cost recovery and tariff reform. These \nwere discussed as part of the policy dialogue and it was agreed that the review of tariffs should \ninclude  operational  efficiency  targets,  include  support  to  water  resource  protection  and \nmanagement, discourage groundwater use, and promote water conservation and reuse. KMG\u2019s \nexisting tariff setting has established a cost recovery mechanism in ensuring proper protection and \nmanagement  of  existing  and  future  water  resources.9 A  third  lesson  is  that  increased  public \nawareness is one of the most effective measures to improve the sector\u2019s performance and urban \nenvironment. In view of this, KMG will embark on a comprehensive multimedia public awareness \ncampaign  on  water  metering,  conservation,  reuse,  and  effective  environment  protection  and \nmanagement. Further support is needed to ensure strict enforcement of metering to reduce water \nlosses by users. A lesson related to resettlement is the need for the establishment of an effective \ninternal  and  external  monitoring  mechanism  of  resettlement  implementation  by  resettlement \nagencies. Municipal and county-level arrangements for monitoring and evaluation have been fully \nincorporated in the resettlement plans (RPs). \n \n23.  A recent review of the water supply, sanitation, and waste management sector undertaken \nin the PRC, identified success and deficiencies, and lessons from portfolio performance.10 Among \nthe major issues identified were delays in the startup of projects and in procurement, and weak \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and sustainable operations. These issues \nhave been reviewed in detail during project preparation and the lessons have been incorporated in \nthe project design. Implementation arrangements have been strengthened within KMG, the project \nmanagement office (PMO), and the Implementing Agency (KWSG). Clear roles and responsibilities \nand effective coordination between provincial, municipal, and county level governments are in \nplace to ensure smooth domestic processing, approval, and project implementation. \n \n                                                 \n9  Part of the tariff is the raw water fee (currently CNY0.43/m3). Part of this fee (CNY0.20/m3) is allocated for water \nresource protection, which is used in compensating the local farmers on shifting to organic farming and environment-\nfriendly farming practices. Municipal, county, and village programs are coordinated mainly between the Agriculture, \nForestry, and Water Resources Bureaus. Historically, any shortfall in funding has been provided by Kunming Finance \nBureau and YPG. \n10  ADB. 2005.

Impact and Outcome \n24.  The impact of the Project is improved urban environment, public health, and quality of life \nfor urban residents of Kunming; and sustained economic development of the city, through the \nprovision of safe and reliable water supply. The outcome of the Project is the provision of more \nefficient,  reliable,  affordable,  safe,  and  clean  raw  water  supply;  and  effective  protection  and \nmanagement of water resources in Kunming (contributing to the achievement of MDG 7, target 10). \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The  Project  consists  of  three  components,  broken  down  into  12  subcomponents  and \n40 activities, which provide fundamental support to Kunming\u2019s 11th FYP and beyond. The three \ncomponents are (i) water resources development, (ii) water conveyance systems, and (iii) capacity \ndevelopment and project management. Details are in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n26.  Water  Resources  Development.  This component will (i) increase water inflow to and \nperennial  storage  in  the  existing  natural  Qingshuihai  water  storage  and  distribution  facilities \n(34 km2) and (ii) construct Qingshuihai and Jinzhongshan reservoirs.  Transit dams and reservoirs \nwill be constructed to store water in Qingshuihai reservoir from the four surrounding catchments \ntemporarily (Banqiaohe, Shiqiaohe, Xintianhe, and Tabizi Longtan Springs). From Qingshuihai, \nwater will be transferred as a steady flow to Jinzhongshan reservoir. With the Project, the quality of \nraw water will be maintained at class II and will serve about 30% of domestic water and other \nnonindustrial demands in Kunming in 2012; a sustained level of 24-hour water service and quality, \nand  prevention  of  subsequent  shortages  in  Kunming  urban  area  as  demand  increases;  and \nimproved overall public satisfaction with water supply services. \n \n27.  Water Conveyance Systems. This component will take water from Qingshuihai under \ngravity which is energy efficient, to NADZ and Kunming through Jinzhongshan water storage and \ndistribution facilities, and to the EDZ through Songhuaba reservoir. The conveyance works  which \nis about 72.8 kms comprise: (i) 12.5 km of tunnel and other structures between Shiqiaohe reservoir \nto  Qingshuihai;  (ii)  4.0  km  of  tunnel  and  other  structures  between  Banqiaohe  reservoir  to \nQingshuihai; (iii) 50.78 km of tunnel and other structures from Qingshuihai to Jinzhongshan, with \n43.1 km to Tongxin Gate (where the flow can be divided or directed to either Jinzhongshan and/or \nSonghuaba reservoirs) and 6.9 km from Tongxin Gate to Jinzhongshan; and (iv) rehabilitation of \n5.7 km of channel from Tabizi Longtan to Qingshuihai.  \n \n28.  Capacity Development and Project Management. This component will ensure that the \nPMO, KWSG, and other stakeholders are able to implement the Project effectively and manage the \nproject facilities. This component will include project management consulting services, capacity \ndevelopment,  and  various  trainings  during  Project  implementation.  Capacity  development  will \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  to  ensure  proper  and  sustainable \noperation, management, and maintenance of the water storage facilities and conveyance works. \nFurther, focus is on enhanced operational efficiency and financial sustainability and compliance \nwith all relevant national policies for cost recovery and enterprise reforms of the water supply \nsector, and linking with different agencies and institutions on proper water resource protection and \nenvironmental management. The component will include (i) project management and construction \nsupervision;  (ii)  improvement  of  financial  management  and  setup  of  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS);  (iii)  safeguards  management  and  monitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and \nbusiness planning; (v) tariff review; (vi) dam and reservoir management, operation, and safety; (vii) \n ", "8 \nonline water quality monitoring; and (viii) development  of public awareness training on water \ndemand measures and social impact monitoring.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  The Project is the first ADB-financed project in Kunming, and aims to support ongoing \nintegration of water sector management policy and strategic reforms to ensure Kunming\u2019s long-\nterm sustainable growth. The Project builds on and advances ADB policy dialogue and initiatives \nwith the Government in several key areas, including: (i) cost recovery and tariff reform, (ii) pro-poor \nfeatures, (iii) corporate governance reform, and (iv) PSP. The Project has been designed to \ncontinue supporting KMG in creating an enabling environment to ensure the success of its current \npublic-private partnership through tariff reform, strict enforcement of groundwater use restriction, \nenforcement of metering, and improved corporate governance.  \n \n30.  Cost Recovery and Tariff Reform. The current tariff structure is well established and \nprovides  a  strong  foundation  for  project  sustainability.  It  includes  mechanisms  to  (i)  ensure \nfinancial sustainability and full cost recovery; (ii) provide the poor with access to water through a \nlifeline block tariff; (iii) promote economic efficiency by adopting a progressive tariff structure; and \n(iv) meet the social objective of affordability, with households meeting their basic water needs at an \naffordable price. Tariffs meet the full cost recovery of O&M cost plus depreciation of water supply \noperations  (treatment  and  distribution)  and  related  water  resources  development,  reservoir \nmanagement, water source protection, reasonable return to the JV operator, and provision for debt \nservice  of  all  water  supply  sector  loans. 11  The  tariff  structure  allows  transparent  and \nadministratively efficient charging where the amount charged to each type of customer is easily \ncalculated  and  billed.  Any  application  for  tariff  increase  by  KWSG  is  reviewed  by  KMG  and \napproved by YPG, and is based on reasonable grounds of increase in costs and meeting efficiency \nstandards. The financial sustainability of water resource investments is assured through water \nresource  and  water  management  fees  which  cover  the  costs  of  reservoir  operations  and \nmanagement and catchment protection; and channeling to reservoir operators is transparent and \nefficient. The Project will support further tariff reform by (i) assisting KWSG to undertake annual \nreviews of tariffs to ensure full recovery of O&M cost; (ii) policy dialogue with KMG, to move \ngradually towards equalization of nondomestic tariffs for industries and commercial users earliest \nby 2012 to promote water conservation and efficiency; and (iii) monitoring timely tariff increases.  \n \n31.  Pro-Poor Features. The Project will benefit approximately 3.4 million people, of whom \n6.9% are classified poor. It incorporates several features to ensure that the poor, women, and \nvulnerable groups benefit from investments under the Project, including (i) a strong focus on health \nimpacts, which are expected to benefit women and children disproportionately; (ii) support for \ncontinued provision of price subsidies and lifeline tariffs to contribute to cushioning the impact of \ntariff increases on the poor; and (iii) support for KMG\u2019s cross-sectoral water source protection \nprograms to ensure that communities take ownership of environmental protection. \n \n32.  Corporate Governance Reform.  The Project will support corporate governance reform of \nKWSG through: (i) introduction of a water users\u2019 representative on KWSG\u2019s board of directors\u2014\nproviding  a  greater  understanding  of  water  supply  and  distribution  issues  in  the  community, \nensuring  improved  accountability,  improved  services,  and  stakeholders\u2019  welfare;  (ii)  further \nimprovement  in  the  billing  and  collection  and  reduction  in  accounts  receivables  through  full \nmetering of households; (iii) improving the managerial capacity of KWSG in dam and reservoir \nmanagement,  operation,  and  safety;  and  online  water  quality  monitoring,  which  is  a  new \n                                                 \n11 These include World Bank and JBIC loans for water treatment plants, Zhangjuhe reservoir, and water treatment plant \nno. 7. ", "9 \nundertaking for the company; and (iv) enhancing the capacity of KWSG in corporate and business \nplanning  functions  to  coordinate  closely  with  the  JV  in  investment  planning  and  system \nimprovements. There is an assurance for undertaking corporate governance reforms, and this will \nbe supported through consulting services during project implementation. Further, UN-Habitat will \nprovide grant financing to assist KMG in capacity building to (i) implement water conservation and \ndemand management measures, including tariff review; (ii) develop community-based water and \nsanitation services in poorer areas in Songhuaba reservoir; and (iii) develop human value based \nsanitation and hygiene education among water users in Kunming.12  \n \n33.  Private Sector Participation. KWSG has an operating PSP arrangement in the form of a \nJV between a KWSG subsidiary and Veolia (para. 19) to ensure the efficient provision of safe and \nsecure water supply to the growing urban population of Kunming. The Project will support the \nenabling environment for the successful operation of the JV through (i) continued tariff reform and \nregulation, (ii) ensuring that tariff increases are based on meeting efficiency targets and service \nstandards, and (iii) the enforcement of the \u201cone household, one meter\u201d policy. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n34.  The total project cost is estimated at $255.94 million equivalent, including taxes and duties. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the project investment plan, and details are in Appendix 5 and \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Total Costa \nA.

Financing Plan \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of $80 million to finance about 31.3% of the total \nproject cost of $255.94 million. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance civil works, \nequipment, and consulting services. Provincial and municipal governments will provide equity \nequivalent to $76.8 million or 30% of the total project cost. The balance of $99.1 million, or 38.7%, \nwill be provided by a domestic loan from the Agricultural Bank of China. The loan will carry an \ninterest rate of 6.5%, a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Both the municipal \ngovernment and the Agricultural Bank of China have provided commitment letters confirming the \navailability of the domestic loans and equity funding. The equity injection by KMG would represent \nabout 0.4% of annual expenditure over 2008 to 2012 (Appendix 12, para. 14).  \n \n36.  The ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources. The loan will carry an interest \nrate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  for \nUS dollar loans, an annual commitment charge of 0.35%, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 5. \nDisbursements for eligible expenditures will be made based on different ratios specified for each \ncost category. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Costs  % \nA.

The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government will relend the loan proceeds to YPG, which \nwill onlend the loan proceeds to KMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nThe loan proceeds will then be onlent to KWSG on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. KWSG will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB \nloan. The flow of funds and onlending arrangements are in Appendix 6. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  KMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project leading group (PLG) will be \nresponsible  for  project  coordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during  implementation. \nHeaded  by  the  vice  mayor,  the  PLG  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  Kunming  Financial \nBureau, Kunming Development Reform Commission, related agencies, and county governments.13 \nThe PLG will meet as required and will be maintained until project completion. \n \n                                                 \n13 Related agencies include the Construction, Environment Protection, Land and Resources, Planning, Public Utility, and \nResettlement Bureaus, NADZ Management Commission, Forest Administration Bureau, Lake Dianchi Investment \nCompany, and Kunming Drainage Company. County governments are Songming and Xundian County, and Guandu \ndistrict. ", "11 \n39.  The PMO has been established within Kunming Development and Reform Commission. It \nwill serve as the secretariat of the PLG and will be responsible for coordinating the implementation \nof  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure  adequate  interdepartmental  cooperation  and \ninteragency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of project implementation, and (iii) coordinate \ncommunication and interaction among ADB, KWSG and agencies concerned. The IA is KWSG, \nwhich is a limited liability company incorporated under the PRC company law, 2004. The KWSG \nwill  be  responsible  for  operating  and  managing  project  facilities,  direct  day-to-day  Project \nmanagement, construction supervision, preparing progress reports to the PMO for submission to \nADB, and planning strategic direction of water supply and management services and operations. \nKWSG is well organized, with experience implementing World Bank and JBIC loan projects. A \nproject implementation unit has been established in the KWSG and is responsible for undertaking \ndetailed implementation activities. The project organization is in Appendix 7. The internal controls \nand accounting and auditing procedures of KWSG were reviewed through a financial management \nassessment; these are generally in order and will be fully functional and available for use for the \nconstruction  and  operational  phase  of  the  Project.  The  financial  management  assessment  is \nsummarized in Appendix 12 and presented in Supplementary Appendix L. An assessment was \nundertaken  of  KWSG\u2019s  technical  and  institutional  capacities,  which  are  adequate  for  project \nimplementation. KWSG will retain the services of design institutes, procurement agencies, and \nconstruction supervision companies to assist in implementation activities. The PMO and KWSG will \nhave a number of their staff trained in project management and relevant ADB procedures during \nproject implementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from 2008 to 2012 (Appendix 8).14 This \nschedule is considered realistic and achievable, because the project implementation structure and \narrangements  are  already  in  place  and  preparatory  works  are  under  way.  The  detailed \nimplementation plan is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n3.  Procurement \n41.  Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts \nfor works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than \nthe ICB values, but more than $100,000, will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) \nprocedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be \nprocured using shopping procedures.15 The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  Provision has been made for about 18 person-months of international and 72 person-\nmonths of national consulting services to be funded under the Project to support the PMO and IA in \nproject implementation and capacity development. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsulting firm will be selected in accordance with the quality- and cost-based selection method \nusing full technical proposal procedures. A fixed quality cost ratio of 80:20 will be applied. The \nconsulting  services  will  cover  (i)  project  management  and  construction  supervision;  (ii) \n                                                 \n14  Preparatory works such as detailed designs, land acquisition, and resettlement are scheduled in late 2007. \n15 ADB will require KMG to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary) to ensure \nhigh quality and consistency of the documents to facilitate ADB review.  \n ", "12 \nimprovement of financial management and setup of PPMS; (iii) safeguards management and \nmonitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and  business  planning;  (v)  tariff  review;  (vi)  dam  and  reservoir \nmanagement, operation, and safety; (vii) online water quality monitoring; and (viii) development of \npublic awareness training on water demand measures and social impact monitoring. The PMO will \ninitiate  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  including  short-listing  of  qualified \nconsultants. Detailed institutional analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F, and the outline terms \nof reference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n43.  To expedite project implementation, the Government requested ADB to approve advance \ncontracting, which includes recruitment of consultants and procurement of goods and civil works; \nand the request for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for civil works and equipment for \nsite preparation and construction up to $8 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB loan) to be \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than a maximum of 12 months before signing of \nthe  Loan  Agreement. 16  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i) prequalification  of  contractors, \ntendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages;  (ii)  preparation  of  tender \ndocuments for the procurement of materials and equipment; (iii) award of contracts; and (iv) \nrecruitment of consultants. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance procurement action \nwill be subject to ADB approval. All advance procurement actions will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB \nto finance the Project.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate project implementation and funds \nflow, an imprest account will be set up upon loan effectiveness and will be exclusively used to \nfinance ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures. The initial advance to be deposited to an imprest \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever is lower. The direct payment procedures will apply for the large work contracts. If the \nGovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the  reimbursement \nprocedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation  process,  the \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of imprest \naccount  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual \npayment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  ceiling  will  be \nreimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full supporting documentation process.17 The \nimprest account will be opened and managed by Yunnan Provincial Finance Bureau on behalf of \nYPG at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  The PMO will prepare semiannual progress reports indicating progress made, problems \nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected in the next half year. The IA will keep \nrecords to identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, and follow accounting \nprinciples and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC, 2000. The law requires \n                                                 \n16  The advance action for the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. \n17 In line with adequate financial capability of the Executing Agency/IA based on the financial management assessment, \nthe ceiling of the statement of expenditures is identified at a higher level to facilitate disbursement. ", "13 \nenterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  generally  follow  internationally  accepted \naccounting standards. The IA will maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial \nstatements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for the IA will be \nsubject  to  audit  by  KMG  Audit  Bureau,  Yunnan  Provincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  State  Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council and will meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures procedure will be part of the audit reports. The \nIA\u2019s annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no \nlater than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the entire implementation period.18 YPG and \nKMG were informed of ADB\u2019s policy requiring the submission of audited financial statements on \ntime.  YPG,  KMG,  and  the  IA  will  submit  audited  financial  statements  and  reports  to  ADB \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than 6 months after completion of the Project.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n46.  The PPMS indicators include (i) quantity of clean water provided, (ii) improvements in \nmanagement  arrangements  for  project  facilities,  (iii)  adoption  of  least-cost  project  designs, \n(iv) enforcement of environmental regulations, (v) strengthening of water sector governance, and \n(vi) improved management capacity for water supply. The relevance and practicability of data \ncollection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO. \n \n47.  At the start of project implementation, the PMO and IA, with the assistance of consultants, \nwill develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and \noutputs of the project components, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and \nhealth indicators to be used to measure project impacts. A set of indicators for monitoring the \nfuture performance of the project facilities will be designed by the loan implementation consultants \nbefore the start of operations. The PMO and IA will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm \nachievable targets, (iii) firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems \nand procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. \n \n48.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the required \ntime intervals by the IA, including semiannual reporting of the environmental management plan \n(EMP).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  its \nmanagement information system that will be established at the time of loan implementation. The \nPPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action for project design, \nschedule, activities, and development impacts. The PMO, with the assistance of the consultants, \nwill monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB on a semiannual basis on the physical \nimplementation and financial aspects of the Project from start of project implementation to 2 years \nafter project completion to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB \nrequirements. \n \n9.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  KMG  and  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \n                                                 \n18 The IA now has three tiers of audit: (i) internal audit, (ii) municipal government audit, and (iii) provincial and state \ngovernment audit. \n ", "14 \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \ncovenants and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of KMG, IA, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, KMG and IA will undertake the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from assigned relevant bureaus to \ninvestigate corrupt practices in bidding and construction to enhance construction quality control \nand supervise effective work; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract \nwinner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv)  engage  the  project \nmanagement consultant to support the PMO and IA to ensure good governance, accountability, \nand transparency in project operations; and (v) in consultation with relevant central government \nministries, update rules and regulations on local and corporate governance and anticorruption, and \nenhance the transparency of IA operations. Specific governance actions will be undertaken related \nto financial control and management, performance audits, public disclosure of financial statements, \nand any proposed tariff increases on the project website.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n50.  ADB, the Government, YPG, KMG and IA will review project implementation jointly at least \nonce a year and will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of project \nimplementation.  This  review  will  include  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity development measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be \nanalyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n51.  The Project will directly benefit about 3.4 million people living in the project areas, of whom \nabout 6.9% are poor. All residents of Kunming will benefit indirectly, as their living conditions will \nimprove as a result of (i) improved water quality and quantity; (ii) improved security of water supply, \nwhich will mean less likelihood of rationing in drought years; (iii) reduced use of polluted water \nsources;  and  (iv)  reduced  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  the  associated  reduction  in \nmedical costs. In addition, the Project will lead to employment creation during construction and \noperation of project facilities. Health benefits are expected to be felt disproportionately by women \nand children. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n52.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land acquisition and house demolition will impact on \nlocal  residents  at  the  reservoir  inundation  areas,  and  where  infrastructure  will  have  to  be \nconstructed\u2014mainly the dam and diversion complex, water conveyance routes, and permanent \naccess roads. In total, about 5,571.2 mu of land will be permanently acquired for the Project, \nincluding 2,619.4 mu of farmland and 2,214.0 mu of woodland. Some structures will have to be \ndemolished, including 56,633.9 square meters (m2) of residential houses and 7,080.93 m2 of \nnonresidential buildings. In total, 177 households (702 APs) will be permanently affected by land \nacquisition and 492 households (2,093 APs) will be affected by house demolition. In addition, \n2,114.3 mu of land will be occupied temporarily, including 627.0 mu of farmland and 1,260.2 mu of \nwoodland.  Based  on  recent  estimates,  temporary  land  acquisition  will  affect  103  households \n(385 APs). All households affected by land acquisition and house demolition will be compensated ", "15 \nat replacement costs for their assets and will receive other allowances for relocation and income \nrestoration. Households suffering from house demolition will be relocated within their existing \nvillages.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  all  associated  costs  are  estimated  at \nCNY185.68 million, which is equivalent to 10.2% of the total project costs. The summary RP is in \nAppendix 10. KMG has complied with the ADB full disclosure policy for resettlement activities. \nKWSG will construct and upgrade water and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and lay the \nwater distribution networks, which would entail land acquisition and resettlement impacts.19 An RP \nwill be prepared for these facilities based on the agreed resettlement framework (Supplementary \nAppendix H) during implementation of the Project.  \n \n53.  ADB requires resettlement monitoring and evaluation of APs during implementation. The \nPMO will retain the services of a national external monitor for this purpose. The external monitor \nwill visit the subcomponents every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general \nwelfare of those affected, (ii) make recommendations to resolve any issues or problems, (iii) \nprovide advice to the IA and local officials, (iv) evaluate the results through annual survey updates \nfor 2 years after completion of resettlement, and (v) prepare a summary of the final resettlement \naudit for the Project to be provided to ADB. The external monitor will pay special attention to \nvulnerable groups, including women and the poor, to assess whether they have fully regained their \nstandard of living. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every 6 months during \nimplementation and annually for 2 years after completion of resettlement. These reports will be \nsubmitted simultaneously to ADB, PMO, and IA. These will also be uploaded to the ADB website. \n \n54.  Poverty Reduction, Health, and Social Benefits. The Project supports the achievement \nof the MDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people \nwithout sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10). The \nProject will directly benefit 3.4 million people, 6.9% of whom are classified poor, by ensuring that \nthe expanding urban population of Kunming continues to have access to safe water. The Project \nwill support a tariff structure that includes price subsidies and a lifeline tariff to cushion the impact \nof tariff increases on the poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n11, and the full poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n55.  The Project will create employment for approximately 4,200 people on construction work \neach year for 5 years, and an additional 10,920 people will be employed annually in jobs created \nindirectly as a result of construction. It is estimated that at least 50% of the construction jobs will be \nunskilled, and the poor should benefit disproportionately from this job creation. Project construction \nalone will generate approximately CNY236.25 million in wages per year. The Project will contribute \nto the prevention of up to an estimated 1.5 million cases of waterborne diseases from 2013 to \n2020, and the associated increase in median medical costs is projected to be likely to rise from \nCNY18 to CNY30 per capita (at current values) by 2020. Health benefits are expected to be felt \ndisproportionately by women since they are more at risk of waterborne diseases, and by children \nwho have least resistance to such diseases. The health impact assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n56.  Stakeholder  Consultation.  During  project  preparation,  local  government  and  line \nagencies, villagers, enterprises, local groups, and other people likely to be directly affected by the \nProject  were  consulted.  These  consultations  covered  project  scope,  technical  design, \nenvironmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, ethnic minority issues, and \neconomic development potentials. The project team conducted household interviews, focus group \ndiscussions, village leader interviews, and key informant interviews to assess potential project \n                                                 \n19 Associated facilities include the water treatment plants and distribution networks and the WWTPs in NADZ, EDZ, and \nin Xundian County. \n ", "16 \nbenefits and adverse impacts, and generate comments and suggestions in formulating mitigation \nmeasures. Over 1,300 people were interviewed during project preparation. To ensure equal benefit \nfrom the Project, separate consultations were conducted with the poor, women, minority groups, \nand  other  vulnerable  groups.  For  the  assessments  on  environment,  resettlement,  and  ethnic \nminorities,  consultations  were  held  with  representatives  of  affected  counties,  townships,  and \nvillages. Both rural and urban people were familiar with the Project and public support was high. \nThe consultations were taken into consideration in the project design and the formulation of the \nEMP, RP, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), and watershed management strategy. \n \n57.  Ethnic Minorities. The poverty and social analysis indicates that there are a number of \nethnic minority groups in the project areas. In the rural project-affected areas, where there is a \nsignificant ethnic minority population, ethnic people live intermixed with the majority Han people, \nand the project impacts that they will experience will be the same. The Project poses no threat to \ntraditional land rights or cultural or communal integrity. It will seek to maximize the benefits for all \npoor and vulnerable households regardless of ethnicity. It is important that (i) ethnic minority \npeople are able to benefit equally from the Project; (ii) any negative impacts that might affect them, \nalongside the Han majority, are mitigated; and (iii) they participate in project implementation and \nmonitoring. The detailed EMDP is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n58.  A financial impact analysis of the Project and a financial management assessment of the IA \nhave been undertaken. The financial internal rate of return for the Project was computed on an \nafter-tax basis of 5.7%, which compares favorably with the after-tax weighted average cost of \ncapital in real terms of 3.7%, demonstrating the financial sustainability of the Project. The result is \nrobust to a range of sensitivity analyses. The average incremental financial cost of treated water \n(CNY2.74/m3) compared with the average tariff (CNY3.33/m3) demonstrates that water users as a \ngroup are paying in excess of the average incremental financial cost by CNY0.59/m3 (excluding \ntaxes),  so  that  the  cost  of  the  water  distribution  operations  and  water  source  reservoir \nmanagement are being fully recovered. The affordability analysis demonstrates that a low-income \nhousehold would pay only 1.7% of household income in 2007 (for 60 liters per capita per day) and \nan average income household 1.1% (for 100 liters per capita per day). Even where wastewater \ntariffs were increased to full cost recovery levels (about CNY2.00/m3 by 2016) a low-income \nhousehold would pay only 2.3% of income and an average income household 1.2% of household \nincome for both their water and wastewater requirements. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12, \nthe tariff and affordability analysis is in Appendix 13, and the detailed financial analysis and \nfinancial management assessment is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n59.  The historical financial performance of KWSG water operations indicates that it has been \nable to operate without any subsidies and within the tariff structure. However, because of lack of \ninvestment, water losses have risen from 24% to 40%. The JV will address water losses in \nKunming and the introduction of full metering to customers, while KWSG will be responsible for the \ndevelopment of new distribution systems in the EDZ and NADZ.  \n \n60.  Overall revenues of KWSG will increase from a forecasted CNY784 million in 2007 (the first \nfull year of JV operations) to CNY2,270 million in 2020\u2014mainly as a result of KWSG\u2019s share of \nincreased water sales, which account for 54% of revenues in 2020. In addition, KWSG will receive \nfunds from the tariff for loan repayment and water management fees to cover reservoir operations, \nas well as lease payments from the JV for use of water treatment plant no. 7. KWSG\u2019s net profit \nafter tax is projected to increase from CNY25 million in 2007 to CNY439 million in 2020. The debt \nservice ratio is adequate in all years, with cash available for debt service exceeding 1.6 times debt \nservice. With the inclusion of Zhangjiuhe in KWSG\u2019s balance sheet from 2007, the debt-equity ratio ", "17 \nincreases to 46% from 7% in 2006; with Qingshuihai assets and funding, it remains at 46% in 2009 \nbefore decreasing over the remainder of the forecast period to 22% by 2020. \n \n61.  KWSG financial management procedures and capacity are adequate to undertake the \nProject. KWSG has had experience in preparing and implementing three JBIC and World Bank \nfunded  projects  between  1991  and  2007.  Its  extensive  experience  and  demonstrated  project \nimplementation capacity should facilitate smooth and successful implementation of the Project. \nTraining will be provided on ADB loan processing policies and capacity development, including \nreservoir management and long-term corporate and financial planning. \n \nD.  Economic Aspects \n62.  The economic analysis provides the rationale and justification for the Project based on \npolicy, sector, and local area analysis. The economic rationale is sound, based on addressing \nKunming water supply requirements with sufficient quantity and class II water quality. This will \nimprove both the water security and water quality, and it will no longer be necessary for Kunming \nto rely on polluted sources. This will improve overall living conditions, especially for the poor. The \nwater quality targets are clearly defined, legally established, and consistent with international \npractice. The plan to meet water quality targets uses low-cost gravity-fed raw water bulk supply \nfrom Qingshuihai Lake, and is demonstrated to be both the best technical and least-cost option. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project is 20.1%,  which  is  above  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The result is robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. A \nsummary economic analysis is in Appendix 14 and details are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n63.  Extensive public consultation\u2014involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus \ngroup discussions\u2014was undertaken during preparation of the environmental impact assessment \n(EIA). The EIA is based on the national laws, regulations, and standards applicable in PRC.20 The \nproject  approach  to  water  resources  use,  environmental  protection,  and  project  infrastructure \nmanagement  was  thoroughly  discussed  and  technical  studies  were  undertaken  during  EIA \npreparation to meet the stringent government approval process. These include (i) comprehensive \ntechnical analysis for the Water Use Certificate related to all project water users and the provision \nof environmental flows, and (ii) water source environmental management planning. It was also \nconfirmed that the Project will abide by the national guidelines for protection of water sources in \naccordance  with  the  technical  specifications  issued  by  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration. \n \n64.  The overall strategy and action plan for water sector activities within Kunming Municipality \nwere discussed with KMG and it was agreed that environmental issues related to the Project be \nconfined to (i) Qingshuihai watershed area, (ii) source river areas downstream of the project \nreservoirs that may be impacted during operations, (iii) project associated facilities, and (iv) issues \narising for treatment of wastewater generated as a result of the Project. \n \n65.  The Project will (i) relieve the water supply pressure in Kunming city, (ii) save water by \nreplacing inefficient groundwater wells, (iii) have positive effects on economic development of \n                                                 \n20 Yunnan Environment Protection Bureau will approve the EIA, including the Strategic Environmental Planning Proposal. \nIt is anticipated that Yunnan Environment Protection Bureau, following due review, will approve the EIA in mid-June. \nThe TA consultant has reviewed the EIA against criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines and \nthe  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Guidelines  (SEPA  1993).  Overall,  the  application  methods  and \nstandards for preparation of an EIA have been observed, and are assessed as compliant with the above guidelines, \nand are in agreement with all existing national and local laws and regulations. \n ", "18 \nKunming,  (iv)  improve  health  status  by  supplying  clean  water,  (v)  provide  temporary  and \npermanent jobs during the construction and operation period, and (vi) benefit the ethnic minority. It \nalso concludes that various existing and potential water users have been considered and will not \nbe affected significantly. The ecological impacts on Jinshajiang and Xiaojiang rivers will be minimal \nsince  the  proportion  of  water  transferred  from  the  Xiaojiang  will  be  well  below  the  globally \nestablished Water Resource Development Indicator for river basins in the Project, at 11.78% of the \nXiaojiang  and  just  0.08%  of  the  average  annual  discharge  in  the  Jinshajiang.  Environmental \nimpacts during construction on air, water, and the acoustic environment will be temporary and \nlocalized, and if proper mitigation measures are implemented, the impacts on sensitive receptors \ncan be minimized. The implementation of the EMP and soil erosion prevention plan will mitigate \nthe construction-related impacts, especially in the 65 spoil disposal sites. Environmental flows, an \nadaptive management plan for riparian releases, and further survey on water use and in-stream \necology in the downstream reaches of Xiaojiang River will mitigate the downstream impacts. \nIndirect impacts will be mitigated through additional wastewater collection and treatment capacity \nto be installed in the NADZ and EDZ to prevent additional untreated wastewater flows returning \ninto the environment, in particular into Dianchi Lake. \n \n66.  The summary EIA complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental policy, and ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.21 It concludes that the Project will have \nsubstantial positive environmental and socioeconomic benefits, and provide lasting benefits to \nassist poverty reduction. The Project will result in (i) contribution to Kunming\u2019s water supply for \nresidential and industrial needs in new development zones; (ii) clean and safe drinking water for \nproject beneficiaries; (iii) disproportionately more benefits for the poor in the form of improved \naccess to safe drinking water supply, given that they are less able to afford bottled or boiled water; \n(iv) positive health implications for all through reduced risk of contaminated water supply; (v) a \nreduction  in  demand  for  overstressed  groundwater  resources  in  Kunming  city  area;  and \n(vi) strengthening expansion of water conservation and water reuse programs. The summary EIA \nand EMP are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n67.  The Project has no unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs with proven \nrecords of safety and reliability will be adopted for water storage and transfer (tunneling) systems. \nDuring project implementation, the consultants and dam technical specialists will support the PMO \nand  IA  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works  comply  with  design  requirements  and  quality \nstandards.  Yunnan  Design  and  Research  Institute  is  undertaking  substantive  on-ground  and \nsubsurface surveys to quantify the potential risks more fully prior to finalizing the conveyance \nsystem alignment. \n \n68.  The following risks could affect timely implementation and economic viability, and reduce \nthe intended benefits of the Project: (i) failure to implement the water treatment plant and WWTP \nprojects within the new development zones by the time of project completion/commissioning; \n(ii) failure of KMG to prevent groundwater use completely to utilize Qingshuihai water supply fully \nas soon as it becomes available (given the additional capital costs of Qingshuihai water and if the \nwater will not be fully utilized, this would put pressure on tariffs to cover debt servicing); (iii) failure \nof KMG to increase tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (iv) failure of KMG to undertake \ndetailed studies and surveys on catchment areas and formulate regulations for the project water \nresources protection.  \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. ", "19 \n69.  Risk (i) will be mitigated through assurances from KMG on the provision of the water \ntreatment  plant  and  WWTP  capacities  to  synchronize  with  project  implementation  and \ncommissioning. Risks (ii) and (iii) will be mitigated through assurances from KMG on improving \ncontrol and regulation of groundwater use, and regular tariff reviews and adjustments. KMG shall \nlevy additional charges on groundwater use in excess of water tariffs to discourage groundwater \nuse. Risk (iv) will be mitigated through assurance from KMG that it shall develop a pollution \ninventory, and establish a catchment modeling system, which will form the basis for prioritization of \nQingshuihai  reservoir  protection  options  and  development  of  an  environmental  monitoring \nprogram.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor  compliance  with  the  financial,  environmental, \nresettlement,  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  the  required  institutional  coordination  and \nproject arrangements are established for effective project implementation and operation.   \n \nV.

Introduction  \n1.  The urban population in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has grown from about \n160 million (17% of total population) in 1975 to 562 million (43%) in 2005, with 359 million in \nmunicipal cities.1 The urban population is expected to grow further to 45% in 2010, 49% by 2015, \nand 55% by 2020. The number of cities has also grown from 122 in 1949 to more than 661 in \n2005. The rapid expansion poses significant challenges for the provision of urban services\u2014\nincluding  increased  demand  for  potable  drinking  water  supply  throughout  the  PRC\u2014putting \nincreasing pressure on the environment and posing a threat to water quality of available supplies. \nCurrently, many cities across the PRC experience a shortage of raw water supply, while water \nsupply  capacity  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are  still  below  targets  set  in  the  PRC\u2019s \n11th Five-Year Program (FYP). \n \n2.  A  key  priority  for  the  PRC  under  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  is  to  ensure \nenvironmental  sustainability  by  moderating  economic  growth  and  enforcing  environmental \nprotection measures. By 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater is targeted to be reduced by 50%. In the mid-1980s, the need for water sector reform and \nincreased tariffs was recognized. Under the Government\u2019s market-based reforms, all water supply \ncompanies and new water supply projects, including those dealing with raw water supply delivery, \nare required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. The Government is also \nincreasingly concerned about the need for policy reform and capacity development to improve \nwater resources management.2 People are more aware of the need for water conservation and \nmany cities have established a Water Conservation Office. Because of the severity of urban \nenvironmental problems, the Government has made cities the focal point of its environmental \nprotection efforts under the 11th FYP. \n \nB.  Water Sources and Supply \n3.  Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, is located on the Panlong River at the head of the \nDianchi  Lake,  in  a  region  that  has  lower  than  average  rainfall.  As  early  as  1994,  Kunming \nmunicipal government (KMG) identified 14 possible schemes anticipating the need for increased \nwater supplies. The proposed Qingshuihai project is the preferred technical and least-cost option. \nThe existing water sources for Kunming are shown in Table A2.1. The majority of the water supply \nis managed through surface water reservoirs, including the use of water from Dianchi Lake up to \nMarch 2007. Zhangjiuhe was commissioned in April 2007, and Kunming will no longer depend on \nthe  poor  quality  water  of  Dianchi  Lake  (the  lake  has  deteriorated  because  of  increased \nurbanization,  limited  wastewater  treatment,  and  overuse  of  its  water  sources  over  the  past \n25 years). Kunming CGE Water Supply Co., Ltd. entered into a joint venture (JV) with Veolia to \ntreat raw water to comply with drinking water standards and distribute water to the population of \nKunming.  \n \n4.  The  water  sector  continues  to  have  priority  under  the  11th  FYP  for  the  Economic \nDevelopment of Kunming City (2006\u20132010). The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing \nwater sources; (ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution in \n                                                 \n1  Background Information Report for Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006. Urban Sector Road Map for the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Manila (July). \n2   New  technical  guidelines  for  water  resources  protection  were  issued  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration (SEPA) in 2007. These promote and regulate PRC policy to protect and prevent pollution in all \nreservoirs intended as sources for drinking water supply, and for the long-term management and sustainability of water \nresources for water supply.

Under  water \nconservation  and  energy  saving  policies,  Kunming  is  encouraged  to  develop  effluent  reuse, \nrainwater harvesting, and recycling practices to mitigate overall raw water demand. During project \npreparatory technical assistance, the Project provided a customer satisfaction survey model to \nKunming Water Supply Group Company Limited (KWSG) to ensure that needed water supply \nservices improvements are implemented. \n \nTable A2.1: Existing Kunming City Water Sources (2006) \n  Annual Supply     Associated Water \nSource  (million m3)  Water Quality Class  Treatment Plant \nSonghuaba Reservoira  149.4  III  Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 6 \nBaoxianghe Reservoir  15.6  II   \nDahe and Chaihe Reservoirs  35.8  II   \nShalang River Diversion  11.0     \nGroundwaterb  63.1  II\u2013III   \nChenggong Groundwater  2.6  II  Local treatment \nDianchi Lake  109.5  V  Nos. 3 and 5 \n          Total  387.0     \nm3 = cubic meter, no. = number. \na  Songhuaba water is also directed to Water Treatment Plant No. 3, now that the need for Dianchi Lake water has been \nsuperseded with supply from Zhangjiuhe. \nb  Because of water shortage, groundwater consumption has been increasing, with potential risk for increased pollution \nfrom surface ingress. With the Zhangjiuhe project, and later the Qingshuihai project, it is planned that use of \ngroundwater will be phased out.  \nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \nC.  Urban Wastewater Management \n5.  Wastewater management relates to the collection, treatment, and disposal of both urban \nstorm  water  and  wastewater.  Kunming  Drainage  Company,  under  Dianchi  Lake  Investment \nCompany,  is  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  storm  water  and  sewer  drainage \nnetwork in Kunming city. This network is old, and because of limited investment, has not kept pace \nwith  the  rapid  development  of  the  city.  Under  the  11th  FYP,  the  objective  is  to  achieve  an \nimprovement in the lake\u2019s water quality. Therefore, more wastewater treatment capacity is required \nto reduce the quantity of untreated wastewater or to improve the quality of treated effluent that is \ndischarged  to  the  lake.  Table  A2.2  summarizes  the  current  and  future  projected  wastewater \ntreatment capacity in Kunming. \n \nTable A2.2: Kunming City Wastewater Treatment Plant Capacity, 2006\u20132010 \n  Current Capacity (2006)  Future Capacity (2010)a \nWastewater Treatment Plant \n  \u2019000 m3/day   \u2019000 m3/day  \nNo. 1 WWTP  120  120 \nNo. 2 WWTP  100  100 \nNo. 3 WWTP  150  210 \nNo. 4 WWTP  60  60 \nNo. 5 WWTP  75  170 \nNo. 6 WWTP  50  130 \nNo. 7 WWTP  0  200 \nTotal  555  990 \nCoverage  60%  90%b \nm3/day = cubic meter per day, No. = number, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \na  Estimated capacity with proposed new developments or expansion of existing WWTPs to 2010. \nb  Estimated treatment capacity for city wastewater treatment by 2010. \nSource: Kunming Water and Wastewater Master Plan. ", "Appendix 2        27 \n6.  Kunming currently has six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with total capacity of \n555,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day), sufficient to treat 60% of the dry season flow. However, the \nwastewater collection network in Kunming is far from complete, so not all of this capacity is utilized. \nSome untreated wastewater is discharged to the city\u2019s rivers and drains, and flows directly to \nDianchi Lake, especially during the wet season. The annual discharge of combined wastewater \nand storm water into Dianchi Lake each year overloads the natural biodegrading capacity of the \nLake. In 2006, Kunming municipal government (KMG) initiated the Dianchi Lake Environmental \nImprovement  Project  for  the  northern  part  of  Dianchi  Lake,  funded  by  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) of CNY3.83 billion ($500 million) over a 6-year period.3 \n \nD.  Water Demand and Development Considerations \n7.  The main future water demand growth will come from development of the New Airport \nDevelopment  Zone  (NADZ)  and  East  Development  Zone  (EDZ).  Current  local  sources  are \noverstressed, and in some cases water quality is poor (Table A2.1). The overall objective will be to \nprovide clean and affordable water to Kunming city and two new development zones, and relieve \npressure on existing overused sources. The projected total raw water requirement for the new \ndevelopment  zones  would  be  about  107  million  m3/year  by  2015,  rising  to  an  estimated \n149.0 million m3/year by 2020, even after allowing for improved water supply, treatment, and \ndistribution efficiencies through to 2020. Future water supply and demand for Kunming and the \nnew development zones is summarized in Tables A2.3 and A2.4.4 \n \nTable A2.3: Kunming Base Case Water Supply, 2007\u20132020  \n  2007  2010  2015  2020 \nWater Source  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3) \nSonghuaba Reservoir  140.4  140.4  140.4  140.4 \nBaoxianghe Reservoir  15.6  15.6  15.6  15.6 \nDahe and Chaihe Reservoir  35.8  35.8  35.8  35.8 \nShalang Diversion  11.0  11.0  11.0  11.0 \nGroundwater  63.1  63.1  30.0  30.0 \nChenggong Groundwater  2.6  2.6  2.6  2.6 \nDianchi Lake  27.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nZhangjiuhe  164.0  218.6  218.6  218.6 \nQingshuihai   0.0  -  104.0  104.0 \n       Total  459.5  487.1  558.0  558.0 \nm3 = cubic meter. \nNote: It is anticipated that groundwater will be reduced by 2012, once Qingshuihai is commissioned. \nSources: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited, Yunnan Design Research Institute and project preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  The project will (i) achieve a wastewater collection rate of 90% by rehabilitating 144 kilometers (km) of drainage \npipelines and 207 km of sewage pipelines; and (ii) increase the WWTP capacity by 410,000 m3/day by renovating \nthree existing WWTPs, building a new WWTP, and upgrade the six existing WWTPs to output effluent to or above the \nrequired standard. \n4  As NADZ is at an elevation that cannot be serviced from the existing city supply without pumping, KWSG prefers to \ndevelop an alternative source that can supply water to NADZ under gravity, to minimize energy requirements in \naccordance with national policy. \n ", "28        Appendix 2 \nTable A2.4: Water Demand and Supply Balance, 2007\u20132020 \n  2007  2010  2015  2020 \nArea Water Demand  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3) \nKunming Main City  404.0  415.8  398.8  408.3 \nEastern Development Zone  29.4  52.4  88.6  125.3 \nNew Airport Development Zone  0.0  9.2  18.5  23.7 \n      Total Water Demand  433.4  477.4  505.9  557.3 \nWater Availability with Qingshuihai   459.9  487.1  558.0  558.0 \n      Net Projected Balance   26.1  9.8  52.0  0.7 \nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSources: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited, Yunnan Design Research Institute and project preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n \n8.  The water supply from the existing reservoirs,5 while generally reliable, is declining with \nsevere limitations during drought periods. In recent years, rainfall has been less than average, so \nthere has been insufficient water during summer months to meet demand fully, and this has led to \nrationing and restrictions on commercial users. The new Zhangjiuhe supply will replace water \npreviously drawn from the polluted Dianchi Lake, and provide additional supply to meet current \ndemands and alleviate demand on the other small surface reservoirs\u2014Baoxianghe, Chaihe, Dahe, \nand Shalang. Although they are generally adequate to meet existing requirements, their size \n(catchment and storage) necessitates restriction to supply during drought periods. The provision of \nnew supplies will alleviate the stress on these small catchments and help reduce any demand to \nutilize  groundwater.  This  will  also  enable  any  conflict  with  declared  government  policy\u2014\nenvironment protection, groundwater protection, reduction in pumping\u2014to be avoided. \n \n9.  Qingshuihai water sources are located in the mountains of Xundian County, to the north of \nKunming.6 Because of the mountains, there is more rainfall than in Kunming, and with limited \ndevelopment in these catchments, the water is of good quality (class I or II) while the demand is \nlower. Analysis shows that water transfer of the indicated volumes to Kunming will not have any \ndetrimental  impact  on  inhabitants of  the  source  catchments  or  the downstream  communities. \nFurther, Qingshuihai makes good use of existing facilities\u2014the natural Qingshuihai Lake and the \nexisting Jinzhongshan reservoir\u2014thus minimizing the overall need for new inundation areas. This \nhelps to minimize the need for any resettlement and associated compensation, while minimizing \nenvironmental  impacts  because  of  the  development.  This  new  source  is  essential  for  the \ndevelopment of the NADZ, and the system can readily be extended to the EDZ utilizing the \nbenefits of the natural topography. This would then give additional water security and good quality \nraw water for the population of Kunming city, especially for drought years.  \n \n10.   Urban development in Kunming city confirms that water demand already exceeds the \navailability of primary class (I to III) drinking water supply, and existing constraints to supply have \nled to suppressed demand. To satisfy future demand, KMG has made a long-term water supply \nproject plan,7 and the Project is proposed as a medium-term action to meet water demand in \nKunming city from 2012. The Project will transfer water from four small mountainous catchments\u2014\n(Banqiaohe, Shiqiaohe, Qingshuihai, and Xintianhe, with a total catchment area of 220 square \n                                                 \n5  The existing Songhuaba reservoir is the main water source for the northern and central city districts of the main city. \nLuojiaying groundwater is currently the main source for existing development in the EDZ but, as this is unreliable, \nwater from Songmao reservoir and the Hei and Bai Longtan (springs) will be used as an interim supply for the EDZ \nfrom 2007 until Qingshuihai water can be made available. Baoxianghe, together with local groundwater, is currently \nused to supply some parts of central and east Kunming city, but now Zhangjiuhe water is available, this source will be \nredirected to the NADZ during the initial construction period, prior to Qingshuihai commissioning. \n6  The main advantage of sourcing water in the mountains is that all conveyance can be achieved under gravity (no \npumping, no energy consumption, therefore energy saving policy compliant), through surface contour canals, with \nconnecting aqueducts and tunnels. \n7  Planning references: Kunming City Water Supply Master Plan (1987 to 2020); New Kunming City Water Supply \nPlanning (2004); and Water Supply Plan for Kunming Main City (2002).

The total volume of water to \nbe transferred from the Xiaojiang River will be less than 12% of its annual average discharge at the \nXiaojiang hydrological monitoring station (134.4 km upstream of the Xiaojiang confluence with the \nJinshajiang), at which point the Xiaojiang catchment area is 2,241 km2. The overall impact of the \nwater transfer is to withdraw about 0.0787% of the annual average flow in the Jinshajiang. \n \n11.  KMG has now recognized, following experience with Songhuaba and Yunlong reservoirs \nthat, in accordance with national policy, there is an urgent need to quantify and plan for the \nimplementation  of  watershed  management  as  part  of  a  holistic  approach  to  integrated  water \nresources and environment management. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has initiated policy \ndialogue with relevant government agencies on this, to assess understanding and future intentions, \nwhich will extend well beyond the construction phase of the Qingshuihai Project. Following the \nPRC  law  on  Provision  for  Drinking  Water  Source  Pollution  Prevention  (1980),  after  project \ncompletion,  KMG  will  delineate  the  Qingshuihai  drinking  water  source  protection  zones  in \naccordance with technical guidelines8 and issue \u201cQingshuihai Drinking Water Source Protection \nRegulations\u201d that will specify objectives, principles, and monitoring requirements to ensure the \nsustainable protection of Qingshuihai and associated water sources for drinking water supply.9  \n \n12.  Necessary due diligence on the associated facilities was undertaken. KWSG will construct \nthe water treatment plants in the EDZ (detailed design completed) starting December 2007 and \nNADZ during the period 2009\u20132012. The Project will also increase the quantities of wastewater to \nbe treated in Kunming City, the EDZ, and NADZ. Under KMG\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, the target is for \n80% of all wastewater to be treated by 2010, in line with national policy. With a JBIC loan \n(CNY3.83  billion),  KMG  has  just  commenced  the  North  Dianchi  Lake  (Caohai)  and \nWastewater/Environmental Management Project10 over a 6-year period.  \n \n13.  Kunming Drainage Investment Company will construct two new WWTPs in the NADZ and \nanother will be constructed in the EDZ by Kunming Xindu Investment Company of Chenggong \nfrom 2009 to 2012 as planned in readiness for the arrival of new water supply from Qingshuihai. In \nthe NADZ, WWTPs are to be constructed at the north (40,000 m3/day) and south (25,000 m3/day) \nends of the runway. In the EDZ, all the collection system was constructed at the time of developing \nthe road network, which includes a pipe network to recycle water for landscaping and parks. The \nobjective  is  to  minimize  the  amount  of  treated  water  discharged  to  Dianchi  Lake.  Based  on \npopulation forecasts and water demand projections in the EDZ, wastewater treatment capacity \nrequirements are projected at 120,000 m3/day in 2011 and 200,000 m3/day in 2015. In Xundian \nCounty, two WWTPs will be upgraded. According to the respective city development master plans \n(for Kunming New City, the EDZ, NADZ, and overall water supply and wastewater management), \nthe wastewater will be treated to approved national standards, suitable for reuse or for discharge to \nDianchi Lake.   \n \n    \n                                                 \n8  SEPA. 2007.

Project Scope and Components \n1.  There  are  three  main  project  components:  (i)  water  resources  development;  (ii)  water \nconveyance  systems;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and  project  management.  Component  1 \nrelates to the development of infrastructure to transfer water from several small catchments into \nQingshuihai Lake, a natural lake that already provides water to Xundian Town and the adjacent \nagricultural area. Component 2 involves the tunnels and associated works needed to convey the \nwater from source to Qingshuihai, and from Qingshuihai to Jinzhongshan reservoir for release to \nKunming and the development zones. Component 3 covers the required capacity development and \nproject  management  to  ensure  timely  project  implementation  and  future  operation  of  project \nfacilities.  \n \n1.  Component 1: Resources Development  \n2.  The Project involves the development of two new reservoirs (Banqiaohe and Shiqiaohe) \nand  the  increase  in  capacity  of  three  reservoirs  (Xintianhe;  Qingshuihai,  a  natural  lake;  and \nJinzhongshan). Jinzhongshan is a receiving reservoir for water transfer from Qingshuihai. It is \nlocated in Songming County, to the northwest of the proposed New Airport Development Zone \n(NADZ), and will act as the balancing and emergency storage for incoming flows for Kunming and \nnew development zones.  \n \n3.  Qingshuihai is currently supplemented by the water transfer of flow from the neighboring \nXintianhe reservoir that lies to the west. However, as the existing reservoir is silted up, water \ntransfer to Qingshuihai is limited to \u201crun of river\u201d through the existing tunnel. The inlet portal to this \ntunnel also needs rehabilitation. The Tabizi Longtan springs transfer to Qingshuihai has fallen, so \nthe small diversion weir and control gates need to be rehabilitated to restore the supply to the \nconveyance channel (to be rehabilitated). Two dams (Banqiaohe and Jinzhongshan) are more than \n30 meters high and both sit across narrow valleys, so they are not very long embankments. The \nplanned storage for these reservoirs is quite small, with only Qingshuihai (already at 117 million \ncubic meters [m3]) greater than 10 million m3. Key concerns that have been assessed with the \ndesign of these dams by the project preparatory technical assistance are (i) hydrology and yield; \n(ii)  sediment  inflow  and  management;  (iii)  active  storage  capacity;  (iv)  flood  management; \n(v) structure  monitoring,  stability,  and  safety  (in  a  seismically  active  region);  (vi)  operational \ncharacteristics  to  effect  transfers;  and  (vii)  impacts  on  existing  catchments,  environment  and \ndownstream riparian water users. The design and planning were in accordance with People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) safety and quality standards and safeguard measures. Details are in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n4.  The implementation plan (Appendix 8) groups all the water source dam and transfer system \nworks infrastructure together, for completion and commissioning by 2012. The works will be divided \ninto  four  construction  contracts  (Appendix  9),  with  the  Shiqiaohe  and  Xintianhe  dams  and \nappurtenant river management (during construction) and water transfer works grouped under one \ncontract. Banqiaohe, Qingshuihai, and Jinzhongshan dams and appurtenant structures will each \nbe an individual contract, and by virtue of their location, there is no dependency between them. \nThe Qingshuihai to Tongxin Gate conveyance works are foreseen as the most critical link for \ncompletion.  \n \n5.  The  operations  rules  for  the  reservoirs  will  include  periodic  flushing  of  sediment  in \nconjunction with major runoff from the catchments. Dam designs have included appropriate water \npressure, settlement, and movement monitoring systems; and will be linked by telemetry to the ", "Appendix 4        33         \ncentral Qingshuihai management office. A panel of experts will review and advice in relation to the \ndams\u2019 design, construction, and monitoring.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Water Conveyance Systems \n6.  The feasibility study report outlines the scale of the proposed conveyance works to transfer \nthe required quantity of water each year effectively from the four sources to Qingshuihai, and from \nQingshuihai to Xundian and Kunming. The conveyance channels have been sized to allow for \nvariable rate discharge, up to a maximum sufficient for the design transfer volume to be delivered \neach year. As the source river flow will be variable because of unpredictable rainfall patterns and \nrunoff, the conveyance channels have a flow capacity some 3\u20134 times greater than the required \naverage transfer flow requirement. \n \n7.  New  conveyance  works  will  be  required  from  Shiqiaohe  and  Banqiaohe  reservoirs  to \nQingshuihai,  and  from  the  outlet  of  the  Qingshuihai  Maichong  tunnel  to  Xundian,  and \nJinzhongshan reservoir. The outlet at Xintianhe and the existing outlet (Maichong tunnel) from \nQingshuihai will be rehabilitated while the transfer outlet from Jinzhongshan will be part of water \nsupply to the NADZ. The levels for the transfer inlets at Banqiaohe, Shiqiaohe, and Xintianhe are \nset to manage sediment in the reservoirs effectively, with flushing capability through the dams, to \nminimize the risk of sediment transfer to Qingshuihai, and associated risk for sediment deposition \nin  the  conveyance  tunnels.  For  implementation,  development  of  the  conveyance  systems \ncomprising  of  tunnels,  aqueducts,  and  channels  (about  72.8  kilometers  in  length)  will  be \nimplemented in three groups: (i) Shiqiaohe, Banqiaohe, and Tabizi to Qingshuihai (source inflows); \n(ii) Qingshuihai to Tongxin Gate (regulated flow to Jinzhongshan and/or Songhuaba); and (iii) \nTongxin Gate to Jinzhongshan (regulated flow to Jinzhongshan). The testing and commissioning of \nthe completed conveyance works to Jinzhongshan is scheduled on the third quarter of 2012. \n \n3.  Component 3: Capacity Development and Project Management \n8.  This component comprises (i) project management to ensure that the project performance \nmonitoring system and reporting requirements are put in place; and (ii) assistance for capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  on  dam/reservoir  management  and  water  quality  online  monitoring, \npublic  awareness,  corporate  and  business  planning  and  strategic  financial  planning  and \nmanagement, tariff review, and safeguards management and monitoring. The consulting services \nwill ensure close alignment between Kunming municipal government and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) management procedures and requirements while ensuring project activities are completed \nwithout delay. The capacity development will (i) support timely monitoring and reporting on the \nresettlement,  environment  and  social  impacts  management  activities,  (ii)  establish  baseline \nindicators for monitoring project progress and performance, and (iii) strengthening financial and \nmanagerial capacity of project management office and Kunming Water Supply Group Company \nLimited during project implementation and subsequent operation and maintenance stages. \n \n9.  Capacity  development  shall  strengthen  the  understanding  of  ADB  implementation \nguidelines  and  requirements,  and  facilitate  strengthened  coordination  between  the  project \nstakeholders. ADB has provided general training in Kunming on procurement and resettlement \nduring project processing, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, which integrates PRC \ndomestic processing and ADB project preparation processes. Further training on project-specific \nprocurement and disbursement procedures will be undertaken at project inception to reinforce \ncompliance with financial management, procurement, and resettlement procedures associated with \nthe ADB loan funded project.  \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \ns  5 2  2 0  2 4  8 1  5   0   0  6  6    7 1  7   3 \nal ost 5 1 10 1 1 1 1 13\notC\n% Tse \na\nB\n \nn e  8 0         0     5           8 0  0   2 \noreighang 59.10 10 3 310 4 3\nFc\n% Ex\n \notal  710 201 634 608 844  901 225  459 000  012   594   655  386  041    328 978  306   941 \nT 6,3,2,3, 2,7, 4,1, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0, 2, 3, 5,\n0 22 1 1 9 1 1 3 3 3 5\n1 1 2\n   \nN\n PLA $ \u2019000 oreign  63,835 3,201               1,000     68,036           12,357 978  13,335   81,371 \nG F\nN s \nI e\nNANC timat ocal  875 0 634 608 844  901 225  459 0  012   558   655  386  041    971   971   570 \nFI Es L 42, 22,23, 2,7, 14, 10, 24, 18, 11, 30, 19, 19, 74,\nD  t  1 1\ns\nN o\nA C  \nATES  mary  Total  0,998 3,907 2,438 9,421 6,412  2,049 4,910  9,892 7,600  6,093   3,720   1,776  6,536  8,312    5,690 7,432  3,122   5,154 \nM m 8111817 25 10 7 46 14 8 22 24 25 94\nTI Su 1, 1,\nS  \nST E A5.1: 000 gn  48 26         00     74           14 32  46   20  n). \nD CO able  CNY \u2019Forei 485,124,3  7,6 517,0 93,97,4 101,3 618,4 2 millio\nE T 1\n0\nL   0.\nDETAI Local  325,850 0 172,019 179,421 6,412  22,049 54,910  109,892 0  76,093   946,646   141,776  86,536  228,312    151,776   151,776   326,734  million ($1\n1, 09  s.\nnt  ct  Y76.mate\n           Item  A.

", "Appendix 10        41         \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Background \n1.  The impact of the Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply Project (the Project) is to provide \nwater supply for Kunming, Xundian County, and the East Development Zone and New Airport \nDevelopment  Zone.  The  Project  involves  the  development  of  five  reservoirs  (Banqiaohe, \nJinzhongshan, Qingshuihai, Shiqiaohe, and Xintianhe) and the submergence of land, reservoir \nimpoundment structures, the development of water transfer and conveyance systems, and the \nestablishment of permanent access roads. Once the Project is completed, about 104 million cubic \nmeters (m3) of water will be supplied annually to the new Kunming city development areas and \n7 million m3 to Xundian County. Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited (KWSG) is the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for the Project. The project management office (PMO), KWSG, Yunnan \nWater Resources and Hydropower Survey, Yunnan Design and Research Institute (YDRI), and \nrelevant local county and town/township governments have worked together to identify the project \nimpact areas, carry out physical indices survey at the reservoir and infrastructure areas, and \nconduct social and economic survey, with assistance from specialists of Hohai University, YDRI \nand  KWSG  have  drafted  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  with  assistance  from  technical  assistance \nconsultants. \n \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n2.  Land acquisition and house demolition will impact upon local residents at the reservoir \ninundation areas or where infrastructure will have to be constructed\u2014mainly the dam and water \ntransfer complex, water conveyance routes (entry and exit to tunnels as well as interconnecting \nsurface facilities: siphons, aqueducts, channels, and pipes) and areas for permanent access road \nconstruction. There will also be some temporary land occupation and use during the construction \nperiod. To avoid or minimize resettlement impacts, local officials and village and village committees \nwere consulted extensively during the feasibility study stages. The number of affected households \n(AHs) and affected persons (APs) are in Table A10. \n \n3.  Land acquisition and house demolition will involve 2 counties, 7 towns, 21 administrative \nvillages, and 41 village groups. In total, about 6,702.0 mu of land will be permanently acquired for \nthe Project, including 3,070.1 mu of farmland and 2,685.7 mu of woodland. In addition, 2,216.5 mu \nwill be occupied temporarily, including 830.0 mu of farmland and 1,240.1 mu of woodland. Some \nstructures will have to be demolished, including 80,891.1 square meters (m2) of residential houses \nand 5,982.0 m2 of nonresidential houses. In total, 1,374 households with 5,147 persons will be \naffected  directly  by  land  acquisition  and/or  house  demolition,  of  which  1,137  households \n(4,295 persons)  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  without  house  demolition,  38  households \n(113 persons)  will  be  affected  by  house  demolition  without  land  acquisition,  202  households \n(753 persons) will be affected by both land acquisition and house demolition, and 292 households \n(1,059 persons) will be affected by temporary land acquisition. Existing infrastructure affected by \nthe Project includes 1 pumping station, 3 water intake dams, 3 transformer stations, 12 bridges \n(culverts), a 9.6 kilometer (km) electricity transmission line, 20.7 km of water diversion channels, \n29.3 km of roads, and 5.1 km of telecommunication lines. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 10   \nTable A10: Project Impacts \nCounty  Xundian  Songming  Total \nTownship (No.)  4  3  7 \nVillage (No.)  16  5  21 \nVillage Group (No.)  26  15  41 \nTotal  4,099.1  2,602.9  6,702.0 \nPermanent LA (mu) \nIncluding farmland  1,528.0  1,542.0  3,070.1 \nTemporary land  Total  1,563.6  652.9  2,216.5 \noccupation (mu)  Including farmland  744.0  85.9  830.0 \nResidential  17,062.5  63,828.6  80,891.1 \nHouse demolition (m\u00b2) \nNonresidential  1,628.7  4,353.3  5,982.0 \nAHs by LA  758  378  1,137 \nAPs by LA  2,923  1,371  4,295 \nAHs by LA and HD  39  163  202 \nDirectly affected \npopulation  APs by LA and HD  150  603  753 \nAHs by HD  10  28  38 \nAPs by HD  38  75  113 \nSubtotal - directly AHs  804  569  1,374 \nSubtotal - directly APs  3,097  2,049  5,147 \nHouseholds  221  71  292 \nTemporary APs \nPersons  798  261  1,059 \nAH = affected household, AP = affected person, HD = house demolition, LA = land acquisition, m2 = square meter, mu = \nunit of land measure, 667 m2, No. = number. \nNote: The number of APs and AHs are calculated based on the impacts by both LA and HD or by LA only.  \nSource: Resettlement Plan, June 2007. \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n4.  The development of this RP is mainly based on the Land Administration Law of PRC, 2004; \nRegulation on Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement for the Construction of Large and \nMedium Size Water Conservancy and Hydropower Works, 2006; Opinions of the State Council on \nImprovement of Post-Resettlement Support Policies for Reservoir-Induced Resettlers, 2006; and \nrelevant policies on land acquisition and house demolition in Kunming city and Yunnan province. \nThe RP has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), as well as other related requirements on social security policies. \n \n5.  An entitlement matrix prepared for the Project based on the following set of resettlement \nprinciples was adopted as follows: (i) involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized \nwhere feasible; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided must be able to allow those affected to \nmaintain their pre-project standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) all the APs, both \nregistered  and  non-registered,  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  assistance;  (iv)  economic \ncompensation must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-project \nstandard of living; (v) where remaining farmland per capita is not sufficient to maintain food supply, \ncash or real-object compensation for those whose land has been expropriated, and other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided; (vi) all those affected will be (a) adequately informed about \neligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project \ntiming; and (b) encouraged to be involved in the implementation of the RP; (vii) no land acquisition \nor demolition shall start until compensation and resettlement benefits has been agreed by all the \nAPs; (viii) compensation and resettlement will be monitored by the IA and independent monitors; \n(ix)  special  assistance  and  treatment  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups,  to  ensure  their ", "Appendix 10        43         \nstandard of living is not impaired, and that opportunities are provided to all APs to retain benefits \nfrom the Project; (x) resettlement must be adequate to cover all the affected aspects; and (xi) all \nresettlers will receive the post-resettlement support fund to restore their livelihoods.  \n \nD.  Compensation Standard, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n6.  The  compensation  for  land  acquisition  includes  a  land  compensation  fee,  relocation \nsubsidy, and standing crop compensation. The land compensation fee is CNY25,120/mu, 16 times \nthe average annual output value (AAOV) for paddy field; CNY18,700/mu for dry land, 16 times its \nAAOV; CNY22,448/mu for orchard land, 13 times its AAOV; CNY6,936/mu for forestland and \nCNY2,774/mu for shrubbery land, both 6.8 times their own AAOV; and CNY18,360/mu for shelter \nforest land, 18 times its AAOV. For unused land, compensation payable will be half that for dry \nland, which equals CNY9,350/mu. The standing crop compensation is CNY785 for paddy fields \nand CNY575 for dry land. In regard to temporary land acquisition, CNY4,710/mu will be paid for \nirrigated land and CNY3,450/mu for dry land. The compensation standard for house demolition is \nset at CNY800/m2 for framework structures, CNY500/m2 for brick-concrete structures, CNY300/m2 \nfor brick-wood structures, and CNY230/mu for adobe-wood structures. In addition, infrastructure \ncompensation, resettlement transportation cost, and other related fees will be provided to the \naffected resettlers. A post-resettlement support fund will be developed, with a standard rate set at \nCNY600 per resettler per year, which will be payable for 20 years. \n \n7.  Measures for income-generation will include cash compensation, land adjustment, industrial \nstructure adjustment, preferential employment, skills training, and post-resettlement support. After \nnegotiation with the affected counties, village officials, and resettlers, it has been agreed that all \ncompensation fees will be paid directly to APs, and land will not be adjusted in the affected \nvillages,  except  for  Laoba  Village.  APs  will  use  the  compensation  for  agriculture  structural \nadjustment,  livestock  breeding,  and  nonagricultural  industries.  In  Laoba  village,  the  land \ncompensation fee will be distributed to all villagers and land will be readjusted in each existing \nvillage. In all villages, direct cash support will be provided to resettlers. During construction, some \nunskilled work will be offered to the APs, for up to 2,100 persons/day. The APs will be given \npreference to undertake the available labor jobs, and about 20\u201330% of these will be provided to \nwomen. In association with the agricultural department(s) and social security department(s), the \nPMO will also contribute to a special fund (CNY320,000) for technical training of those affected \nworkers,  of  which  at  least  50%  of  the  opportunities  will  be  offered  to  women.  Meanwhile, \nCNY250,000 will be set aside by the PMO to provide support to vulnerable groups, together with \nassistance to be provided by the civil administration department. Minority groups will be given the \nsame rights in relation to land acquisition and house demolition as all other APs. \n \n8.  All households affected by house demolition will be relocated within their existing villages. \nIn line with the new rural construction planning for each county and town, the Government will \nprovide funds for the construction of infrastructure, such as water, power, and roads; and the \nQinghai No. 2 group, Haiwei village, Laoba group, Deshi group, and Gegentang group\u2019s farm \nhouseholds will be allowed to build their own houses at planned housing areas. In the groups that \nare less affected by house demolition (Huaqing and Laohaitou and Xiaobeidang No. 5 group), \naffected farm households can choose to have residential land and build houses themselves, \nthrough agreement with village committee. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n9.  The  PMO  (KWSG)  will  take  full  responsibility  for  implementing  project  resettlement  in \naccordance with the approved RP. KWSG will be in charge of transactions and the review of \nprocedures for land acquisition, house demolition, and resettlement, as well as being responsible \n ", "44  Appendix 10   \nfor coordination, management, payments, and monitoring. YDRI will be in charge of deciding the \nimpact  area  of  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition,  and  providing  technical  assistance  for \nupdating the RP report based on designs during project implementation. Xundian and Songming \ncounty governments will carry out resettlement implementation and will be responsible for contract \nsigning  for compensation  and  subsidy  payments;  procedure  handling;  compensation  standard \nidentification; compensation payments, and implementation of living rehabilitation requirements. No \nland acquisition or demolition will start until the RP is updated based on designs and approved by \nADB. The RP will be implemented from September 2007 to December 2011. \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n10.  In accordance with PRC national, provincial, and municipal policies and regulations for land \nacquisition, house demolition, and resettlement, together with ADB policies and guidelines, the \nPMO/IA will hold public consultations, negotiation, and information disclosure sessions with the \naffected people, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage. AHs, \nvillage cadres, town/township and county governments participated in the physical indices survey \nand social and economic survey, and confirmed the survey results. Through consultations and \nnegotiation, APs will be informed about the key contents of the RP. Further negotiation will be \narranged for county/town government leaders and AP representatives prior to RP implementation, \nto  discuss  the  detailed  impacts  for  each  village  and  the  planned  resettlement  measures.  By \nAugust 2007, a resettlement brochure will be provided by the PMO and IA to all affected villages \nand households. This brochure will confirm the project affected areas, the implementation schedule \nand framework, the compensation standards for land acquisition and other assets, relocation \nassistance, livelihood rehabilitation strategy, and dispute resolution procedures. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005),  the  draft  RP  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website \nfollowing the endorsement from Kunming Municipal Government and Environment and Social \nSafeguard Division on 18 July 2007.  The final RP was posted on the ADB website on 9 November \n2007. The PMO will set up project resettlement agencies to supervise implementation, continue the \npublic consultations, monitor progress, and deal with grievances. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement will be conducted. The PMO will carry out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO \nwill engage an independent agency for semiannual monitoring and evaluation. The independent \nagency will monitor and evaluate the progress of resettlement implementation, payment,  and \ndispute resolution. It will identify the impacts for APs on: (i) whether they have received the \napproved compensation and entitlements on time, and (ii) whether their living standard and income \nlevel have been restored to pre-project status. A baseline survey will be carried out before the start \nof land acquisition and house demolition. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every \n6 months during implementation and annually for 2 years after completion of resettlement. External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \nH.  Budget \n12.  Based on the May 2007 base price, the total resettlement cost of the Project is estimated to \nbe CNY185.68 million, which is 10.2% of the total project cost. The cost estimates include costs of \ncompensation for land acquisition, house demolition, reestablishment of special facilities, planning, \nmanagement, training, monitoring and evaluation, and resettlement infrastructure improvement \nbudget. The CNY17.65 million of post-resettlement support fund will be paid to resettlers out of the \ntotal project budget. KWSG will provide counterpart budget for resettlement activities, including \nsupport in case of any shortfall in funds during resettlement implementation.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply Project (the Project) has the potential to benefit 3.4 million Kunming urban \nresidents by preventing increasingly serious shortages in their supply of water for both domestic and commercial use. \nThe Project will enhance quality of life and reduce the risk of an increase in waterborne diseases. By ensuring that \nthere  is  sufficient  water  for  projected  population  increases,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  proposed  economic \ndevelopment of Kunming as a regional center. Specifically: \n \n(i)  The Project will assist in sustaining the PRC\u2019s current achievements of 93% (2004) against Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7, target 10 to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater by 2015. It will ensure that by 2015 up to 3.4 million Kunming residents will have access to safe water.  \n(ii)  The Project will contribute to the prevention of up to an estimated 1.5 million cases of waterborne diseases \nfrom 2013 to 2015, and the associated increase in median medical costs is projected to be likely to rise from \nCNY18  to  CNY30  per  capita  (at  current  values)  by  2015.  Health  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt \ndisproportionately by women since they are more at risk of waterborne diseases, and by children who are \nlikely to have least resistance to such diseases.  \n(iii)  There will be an average of approximately 4,200 people employed each year on construction work over \n5 years, plus 10,920 people employed annually in jobs created indirectly as a result of construction. At least \n50% of the construction jobs will be unskilled, and the poor should benefit disproportionately from this job \ncreation. A further 88 permanent jobs will become available in operation and maintenance (O&M), and  \n10%\u201320% of these are to be for unskilled workers.  \n(iv)  The Project will support continued provision of price subsidies and lifeline tariffs to contribute to cushioning the \nimpact of tariff increases on the poor. \n(v)  In the rural catchment areas, the Project has the potential to reduce poverty both directly through the direct \nand indirect creation of a total of 15,120 jobs per year over the 5-year construction period, and an additional \n229 permanent jobs in O&M. Contracts will require contractors to employ a proportion of local people, and as \nsome 50% of the construction jobs will be unskilled, many of these will be likely to go to poor people. \nIndirectly, the Project will act as a stimulus to local economic development in Songming County and, in \nparticular, Xundian County. The supply of additional water for irrigation and commercial use in Xundian \nCounty, the money spent locally on procurement, and the upgrading of roads in a number of sub-villages \nshould further contribute to economic development in Xundian, estimated to affect over 30,000 people. \nSongming County will also benefit from jobs created and procurement. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                             Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty and social analysis was undertaken in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines. The \nanalysis collected information to assist in the design of the Project by identifying the poor, examining causes of \npoverty, and recommending poverty reduction measures within the scope of the Project. It also examined social \nsafeguard issues in both the rural and urban areas of the Project, especially with respect to vulnerable groups and \nethnic minorities. Water users\u2019 demands and needs, and their willingness to pay health benefits and afford different \ntariff levels were examined. \n \nThe project area includes a diverse range of social groups, poor and nonpoor, Han and ethnic minorities, urban and \nrural populations. The project area is all within Kunming Municipality. The water transfer area is located across two of \nthe  municipal  counties,  Songming  and  Xundian.  The  water  recipient  areas  are  Kunming  city,  the  Economic \nDevelopment Zone (EDZ) located within Chenggong County, and the New Airport Development Zone (NADZ) part of \nthe Guandu District of Kunming city. In 2006, Songming county had a population of 312,000, of which 2.7% was living \nbelow the absolute poverty line (CNY638/capita/year) and 11.5% below the relative poverty line (CNY944/capita/year). \nXundian County, classified a National Impoverished County, had a total population of 479,000, of which 9% was living \nbelow the absolute poverty line and 37.6% below the relative poverty line. In the project transfer area, two of the \n12 villages are classified poverty villages. A detailed poverty and social analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. The \nhealth impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n ", "46  Appendix 11   \nKunming city has an urban population of nearly 3 million people. The poverty line in Kunming city is CNY210 per \ncapita per month, which is the threshold for the Minimum Standard of Living Scheme subsidy. Some 41,784 people, or \n1.7% of the city population, benefit from this subsidy. Although all Kunming residents will benefit from the enhanced \nwater supply, the primary beneficiaries will be residents in the NADZ and EDZ where the projected development is \ndependent on an adequate water supply. In the NADZ in particular, the majority of current residents are farmers, and \nalthough these will be only a small part of the projected population expansion in the future, the majority are currently \nliving in poverty and will benefit disproportionately from the economic opportunities that will be brought by the \ndevelopment facilitated by the increased water supply. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis and consultations were carried out throughout project preparation. Data collection carried out \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance involved interviews with over 400 households in different parts of \nthe project-affected area. It also included 30 focus group discussions and key informant interviews with village leaders; \nrepresentatives of Xundian and Songming County Water Boards; Poverty Alleviation and Development Offices; \nDianyuan, Jinsuo, Liushao townships; NADZ; and EDZ. Participants were encouraged to raise issues that might \nconcern them about the Project and its impacts, as well as give their overall opinions on the Project.  Positive and \nnegative effects to these groups caused by the Project. \n  \nIn addition, in the initial design phase of the Project, the technical team from the Design Institute carried out a number \nof consultations with government agencies, villagers, enterprises, and local groups. Discussions were focused on \ntechnical issues, environmental assessment and resettlement planning. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nProject information related to resettlement and environment will be further disclosed before the Project starts. Local \npeople will have the opportunity to participate in the implementation of the resettlement plan (RP), environmental \nmanagement plan, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), and project construction. \n \nIn addition to ongoing discussions with those who will be affected by resettlement, further consultations will be \nimplemented throughout the implementation phase concerning the effect of current farming practices on watershed \nmanagement, which will be critical for maintaining water quality in the catchment area. The desired outcome of this \nconsultation process would be an integrated strategy for watershed protection, as far as farmers are involved, that is \npractical and acceptable to all concerned. Details of consultation and participation plans for implementation are \nincluded in the RP, environmental management plan, and EMDP. \n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nMen and women will benefit from the unskilled jobs generated by the infrastructure construction. The project \nmanagement office will encourage contractors to employ as many women as possible. The Executing Agency will \nencourage that 30% of the new O&M jobs go to women, assuming suitably qualified women can be recruited.  \n \nWomen are fully involved in consultation processes relating to environment protection in the catchment areas, as well \nas in resettlement planning. A procedure is in place to ensure women are integrated into any income restoration \nactivities associated with resettlement, while an environmental protection plan will ensure that women in catchments \nareas will be actively involved in training and livelihood activities. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Financial Return Analysis of Project \n1.  The  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 The tariffs for water \nsales used to estimate the net financial benefits for raw water supplies are those approved by \nYunnan Provincial Development Reform Commission, December 2005 and implemented in two \nsteps  (January  2006  and  January  2008).  Tariffs  adopted  in  the  project  evaluation  are  those \napproved for July 2007, which will result in an estimated weighted average tariff for all consumers \nof CNY3.53/cubic meter (m3). After deducting value-added tax of 6%, plus water supply treatment \nand distribution costs of CNY1.03/m3, then CNY2.30/m3 may be attributed to the raw water source. \n \n2.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is computed based on Kunming municipal \ngovernment (KMG) equity contributions and the ADB loan and local bank loan, which are assumed \nto carry different nominal interest rates. The WACC for the Project is 3.7% (Table A12.1).  \n \nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n Item  ADB Loan  Domestic Loan Equity  Total \nAmount ($ million)  80.0  99.2  76.8  255.9 \nWeighting  31.3%  38.7%  30.0%  100.0% \nNominal Cost  6.2%  6.5%  10.0%    \nTax Rate  15.0%  15.0%  0.0%    \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost  5.2%  5.5%  8.0%    \nInflation Rate  1.2%  3.0%  3.0%    \nReal Cost   4.0%  2.5%  4.9%    \nWeighted Component of WACC  1.3%  0.9%  1.5%  3.7% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n3.  Results.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  at  5.7%  for  the  Project \n(Table A12.2), which compares favorably with the WACC at 3.7%, substantiating the financial \nviability of the Project. The net present value is CNY453.6 million. Regulatory or tariff revision risk \nfor this Project is minimal. The current tariff is sufficient to recover the operating costs and capital \ncosts.  There  is  limited  risk  of  downward  revision  since  proposed  tariffs  have  already  being \napproved through public hearings held by Yunnan Provincial Development Reform Commission in \nNovember  2005.  The  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  associated  with  corresponding  cost \nincreases, falling to 4.1%.

Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited  (KWSG)  and  Joint  Venture \nDistribution  Company.  KWSG, a company fully owned by KMG with a registered capital of \nCNY534 million was formed in 2004. In November 2005, the water treatment and distribution \nassets of Kunming city were transferred to a newly established subsidiary, KWSG, which in turn \nestablished a joint venture (JV) with Veolia Water Kunming Investment Company Limited, to form \nKunming CGE Water Supply Company Limited. It has a contract to operate specific parts of the \nKunming water supply facilities for up to 30 years. KWSG holds 51% of the shares in the JV. The \nJV operation came into effect on 1 May 2006. \n \n5.  KWSG Operations and Subsidiaries. Water supply operations are the core business and \ncontribute most revenues and profit to KWSG.2 Table A12.3 lists the revenues, operating profit, \nand assets of all the consolidated subsidiaries. The water supply operation accounted for 65% of \ntotal  revenues,  71%  of  the  total  operating  profit,  and  80%  of  the  total  asset  values.  Other \nsubsidiaries can stand by themselves without subsidy from the core business. At the end of 2006, \nKWSG had a total asset value of CNY2.24 billion ($292.8 million). The asset value of water \nproduction was CNY1,792.6 billion in 2006, an increase of 24.7% from 2001. \n \nTable A12.3: KWSG Analysis of Subsidiaries in 2006 \n(CNY million) \nOperating \nItem  Revenue  %  %  Assets  % \nProfit \nKunming General Water Co.

KWSG Historical Financial Analysis. The results of financial analysis are shown in Table \nA12.4. The financial profitability improved in 2006 as a result of the increase in tariffs. The debt \nservice ratio is very satisfactory (5.3 in 2006) once the movements in the cash flow of short-term \nborrowings have been isolated. The current ratios are 1.07 in 2005 and 1.68 in 2006, indicating \nthat KWSG has the liquidity to meet its short-term liabilities. The ratio of account receivables to \nsales, as months of sales, has fallen from a high of 3.4 months in 2002 to 1.9 months of sales in \n2006. The JV is working to reduce accounts receivables further. However, given that meters are \nread and bills issued later in the month for payment with 21 days, accounts receivable will always \nbe at least 1 month of sales at year-end. The return on net fixed assets is low at 2.2% in 2006, \nwhich increased from 1.3% in 2004. It is expected that, with tariff increases in January 2008 and \nimproved operations under the JV, the return on assets employed will increase in the future. The \nratio of long-term debt to total equity and liabilities is low at 7.3% since the JV has no short-term or \nlong-term loans at this time. While KWSG borrowings are essentially long-term (World Bank and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] loans), KWSG has also short-term borrowings for \nthe balance. This reflects the availability of funding to KWSG on the domestic market where only \n                                                 \n2  The other businesses of KWSG are mainly land leasing, construction, and engineering. The other business of the JV \ncompany is engineering and renovation of the existing water pipe network, with the results included in the JV\u2019s \noperations. \n ", "50  Appendix 12   \nshort-term funding is available, but is able to be renewed when it falls due. In general, the historical \nfinancial performance of KWSG water operations indicates that it has been able to operate without \nany subsidies, within the tariff structure.  \n \nTable A12.4: Key Financial Indicators \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nReturn on NFA   1.5%  1.7%  1.6%  1.3%  1.5%  2.2% \nDSR  3.2  6.1  1.1  22.5  10.0  5.3 \nCurrent Ratio  0.8  0.8  1.0  1.0  1.1  1.7 \nQuick Ratio  0.8  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.0  2.0 \nReceivables/Sales (months)  3.0  3.4  1.7  1.8  2.3  1.9 \nLong-term Debt Equity Ratio   19.4%  18.0%  15.9%  15.1%  10.9%  7.3% \nDSR = debt service ratio, NFA = net fixed assets. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Financial Projections for JV Distribution Company and KWSG. Financial projections \nwere prepared for the JV and KWSG over the period 2007\u20132020 to ascertain the overall financial \nsustainability of the water sector. \n \n8.  JV Financial Projections. For the JV, water sales will almost double over the forecast \nperiod from 229 million m3 in 2007 to 444 million m3 in 2020. Total revenues will increase from \nCNY719 million in 2007 (the first full year of operation) to CNY2,390 million in 2020 because of \nincreased water sales and periodic adjustments to water tariffs for inflation assumed at 3-yearly \nintervals. After-tax profit of CNY21 million in 2007 will rise to CNY584 million in 2020. Return on \naverage net fixed assets (historic) will increase from 0.6% to 20.0% over the same period. \n \n9.  KWSG  Financial  Projections,  Sector  Level.  KWSG  financial  projections  include \nconsolidation of 51% of the JV\u2019s revenues and expenditures and fixed assets with other KWSG \nsubsidiaries. KWSG is also responsible for the management and operation of Zhangjuhe reservoir, \nfor which it receives water management fees out of the tariff. KWSG is responsible for funding the \nextension of distribution and water treatment facilities in the East Development Zone (EDZ) and \nNew Airport Development Zone (NADZ) (about CNY1.56 billion) and Qingshuihai water source \ndevelopment over the forecast period. Overall expenditure totals CNY4.68 billion from 2007 to \n2020, with Qingshuihai water source accounting for CNY1.95 billion. This will be financed by the \nproposed ADB loan of $80 million, a domestic bank loan, and KMG equity contributions. KWSG \nreceived CNY774 million from the JV shareholders for 49% of Kunming\u2019s water supply assets. As \nof 31 December 2006, KWSG had cash of CNY1.021 billion which it is utilizing to finance the EDZ \ndevelopments. The Zhangjuhe water source and water treatment plant no. 7 assets are assumed \nto be transferred to KWSG, which is responsible for repaying the JBIC loan and short-term loans \ntaken out to meet cost overruns.3 KWSG\u2019s debt servicing is summarized in Table A12.5 and will be \nmet from its share of JV income plus the loan repayment tariff levy, and its own revenues. \n \nTable A12.5: KWSG Summary Debt Servicing, 2007\u20132020  \n(CNY million) \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 \nInterest  67.2  87.5  81.3  74.5  67.1  32.0  112.8  87.5  94.5  144.7  131.2  119.1  106.5  92.5 \nPrincipal  19.0  120.1  120.1  190.1  190.1  190.1  295.9  285.1  295.9  368.9  359.0  348.4  247.3  257.9 \nTotal  86.2  207.6  201.4  264.6  257.2  222.1  408.7  372.6  390.4  513.6  490.2  467.5  353.8  350.4 \nSource: Asian Development Bank Estimates. \n                                                 \n3  The JBIC loan amounts to CNY1.4 billion, while domestic loans in December 2006 totaled CNY958 million, with an \nestimated project cost of CNY4.5 billion. ", "Appendix 12        51         \n10.  KWSG Water Supply Operation Forecasts. The main revenue sources are from JV water \nsales and increase from 47% in 2007 to 54% in 2020. Income/payments from the loan repayment \nfund levy, water treatment plant no. 7 lease payments, and water management fees would account \nfor a further 20% in 2007 and 21% in 2020. Thus, the JV water distribution operations provide from \nthe tariff and in other revenues KWSG with 66% of its income in 2007 and 75% in 2020. Overall \nrevenues increase from CNY784 million in 2007 to CNY2,270 million in 2020, mainly as a result of \nKWSG\u2019s share of the JV\u2019s increased water sales. Net profit after tax increases from CNY25 million \nin 2007 to CNY439 million in 2020. The debt service ratio is adequate in all years, with cash \navailable for debt service exceeding 1.6 times debt service.4 With the inclusion of Zhangjiuhe in \nKWSG\u2019s balance sheet from 2007, KWSG\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio increases to 46% in 2009 (from 7% \nin 2006) before decreasing to 22% by 2020 (in the absence of further debt funding for further \nexpansion and development of new zones). Cash in bank in 2020 is CNY3 billion, suggesting that \nKWSG has adequate reserves to meet ongoing capital expenditure and extending water supply to \nnew development zones in the future. KWSG may also obtain further investment capital by leasing \nor selling out the rights to undertake the water distribution activities in EDZ and NADZ. Thus, as \nlong  as  tariffs  are  periodically  adjusted  for  inflation  (3-yearly  intervals  are  assumed)  in  the \nprojections, the 2007 tariff levels appear adequate to fund the water sector developments and \nmeet  debt  service  over  the  period  2007\u20132020. 5  Details  of  the  financial  analysis  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nC.

KMG\u2019s total fiscal revenues nearly doubled from 2003 to 2006, with average growth of more \nthan 20%, and maintained a fiscal surplus since 2001. The counterpart fund of KMG for the Project \nis CNY546.6 million, accounting for 2.2% of the 2006 fiscal revenue and 54% of fiscal surplus in \n2006. The funding requirement will be spread from 2008 to 2012 so that annually this would \nrepresent 0.4% of the 2006 revenue base, or about 10% of the 2006 surplus. Further details of \nKMG\u2019s fiscal capacity are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD.  Financial Management Assessment \n12.  Based on the results of the financial management assessment, it was noted that KWSG \nhas a satisfactory financial accounting system with adequate and qualified staff to manage, monitor, \nand report on the flow of accounting, financial, and physical progress. Financial statements are \nprepared monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually to be submitted to senior management, \nboard members, and the State-owned Assets Monitoring and Administration Bureau. KWSG\u2019s \ncurrent reporting has the capacity to link the financial information with the Project\u2019s fiscal progress. \nThere is also a regular review for budget utilization and physical progress by KWSG management. \nFurther, internal and external audit controls are in place and effective. There are no problems in \nthe auditing reports in the past 3 years. Any project, including the current Project, will be subjected \nto a special project completion audit, executed by Kunming Branch of the General Auditing Office \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China. KWSG has had experience in preparing and implementing three \nforeign-funded projects from 1991 to 2007, funded by JBIC and World Bank. Its strong team in \nproject implementation, financial and disbursement management, and resettlement will facilitate \nsmooth implementation of the ADB-financed project. However, training on ADB project-specific \nprocurement and disbursement arrangements and procedures needs to be undertaken at project \ninception. \n                                                 \n4  A debt service ratio of 1.2 times and current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of 1.2:1. are covenanted for KWSG. \n5  The water demand projections, when calculating response to price elasticity, assume real increases in tariffs in 2011 \nand 2016 to bring wastewater tariffs more in line with full cost recovery, assumed at an average of CNY2.0/m3 \ncompared with CNY0.75/m3 for domestic water users and CNY0.90/m3  for nondomestic water users in 2007. \n ", "52  Appendix 13   \nTARIFFS AND AFFORDABILITY \n \nA.  Kunming Water and Wastewater Tariffs \n1.  Kunming water and wastewater tariffs are set out in Table A13.1 for 2005 to 2008. In \nDecember 2005, Yunnan Development and Reform Commission (YDRC) approved tariff increases \nfor 1 January 2006 and 1 July 2007 (to be implemented 1 January 2008), to cover operating costs \nand loan repayments for Zhangjuhe water source. In each customer category, tariffs are uniform \nfor all levels of consumption except for domestic, where a block tariff exists, together with a lifeline \nblock for the card-carrying poor. The lifeline block tariff is set at CNY1.8/cubic meter (m3) for up to \n6 m3/month. \n \nTable A13.1: Kunming Water and Wastewater Tariffs \nCalendar Year  2005  2006  2008a \nWater Tariffs  CNY/m3  CNY/m3  CNY/m3 \nResidential   1.30  2.05  2.45 \nGovernmental   1.70  2.90  3.60 \nIndustrial   1.90  3.30  4.10 \nCommercial   2.40  3.70  4.60 \nSpecialb   5.20  11.10  14.10 \nWastewater Tariffs  CNY/m3  CNY/m3  CNY/m3 \nResidential   0.50  0.75  0.75 \nNondomestic  0.60  0.90  0.90 \nm3 = cubic meter. \na Tariff Increase from 1 January 2008.     \nb Includes sauna, car washing, etc. \nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \n2.  The current domestic tariff consists of a water tariff of CNY2.05 plus a wastewater charge of \nCNY0.75, resulting in a charge of CNY2.80/m3. The water tariff (excluding wastewater) increases \nby 50% above the basic water tariff for consumption from 11 m3/month to 15 m3/month, by 100% \nfor consumption between 16 m3/month and 20 m3/month, and by 150% for consumption above 21 \nm3/month. It is evident from the structure that there is cross-subsidization between the classes, \nwith domestic receiving the subsidy where the weighted average tariff in 2006 was CNY3.60/m3 \n(water and wastewater), compared to a domestic tariff of CNY2.80/m3 (water and wastewater) \nwhere the average family consumes less than 10 m3/month (90 liters per capita per day). \n \nTable A13.2: Current Domestic Tariff Structure \nBlock  Water  Wastewater  Total \n(m3/month)  (CNY/m3)  (CNY/m3)  (CNY/m3) \n0\u201310  2.05  0.75  2.80 \n11\u201315  3.08  0.75  3.83 \n16\u201320  4.10  0.75  4.85 \n>21  5.13  0.75  5.88 \nm3 = cubic meter. \nNote: Card-carrying poor are entitled to first 6 m3 at CNY1.8/ m3. \nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \n3.  The Kunming domestic water tariff approaches the ideal in terms of its structure. It provides \nan affordable lifeline rate for the card-carrying poor up to 6 10 m3/month. The initial block provides ", "Appendix 13        53         \nfor 10 m3/month, while further blocks are narrow (5 m3) and the steps progressive (plus 50%), \nresulting in effective demand management and water conservation. \n \n4.  Wastewater charges represent an allowance for collection and treatment rather than the full \ncost of providing collection, treatment, and disposal. Wastewater charges are included on the \nwater bill and based on 100% of the billed water consumption. \n \n5.  The  tariff-setting  process  in  Kunming  now  reflects  standard  practice  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Tariff applications made by Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited \n(KWSG)  are  reviewed  and  if  necessary  adjusted  through  a  process  of  negotiation  between \nconcerned government bureaus. Approval for the adjustment is given by the city mayor, after which \nthe application for final approval is forwarded to the provincial authorities. As in other cities, \nproposals to adjust the tariffs are publicized and public hearings are held on the tariff proposals. \nThe use of public hearings, the recent tariff increases, and the introduction of wastewater tariffs \nindicates  that  tariff  reform  promoted  by  the  state  government  is  well  developed  in  Yunnan. \nKunming is currently introducing the \u201cone user, one meter\u201d policy. It is estimated that, at the end of \n2006, there were 2.42 households per meter. It is expected that this program implemented by \nKWSG/joint venture company (JV) will be completed in 31 December 2009. \n \nB.  Water and Wastewater Tariff Policies, Objectives, and Structures \n6.  The  following  objectives  are  of  particular  importance  when  developing  water  and \nwastewater tariff structures and levels.1  \n \n7.  Financial  Sustainability  and  Full  Cost  Recovery.  These  are  the  most  important \nobjectives  in  tariff  setting.  Kunming  municipal  government  (KMG)  has  set  water  tariffs  to \nincorporate proper operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of providing treated water. Apart from \nO&M costs to be covered, the tariff provides for specific charges to meet water resource fees of \nCNY0.23/m3 and water management fees averaging CNY0.23 m3. Financial analysis of the JV and \nKWSG suggests that tariffs provide a fair rate of return on distribution assets of water supply and \ndistribution; and provide for reservoir O&M and protection of the watershed area, sector expansion \nusing retained earnings and external funding, and overall sector debt service. In addition, financial \nprojections indicate that, where the current water tariffs are maintained in real terms with periodic \nadjustments for inflation, then increased water sales should be adequate to meet O&M, provide for \ncapital expansion, meet debt service, and allow the JV to recover its investment with an adequate \nreturn. \n \n8.  Economic Efficiency. The purpose of economic efficiency is to promote the efficient use of \nnational resources. Kunming domestic water tariffs promote economic efficiency through demand \nmanagement and conservation by adopting a progressive tariff, while tariffs set at full cost recovery \nsignal the cost of consumption to the consumer. \n \n9.  Price Equity. The aim of price equity is to base tariffs on \u201cfair\u201d criteria, and this is best done \nwhen the charge is based on costs traced to or caused by each customer. In water supply, there \nwill be few variations in costs caused by individual entities. In Kunming, there are four main classes \nof customer and these will in most cases face similar costs of supply. It could be argued that \ndomestic customers place greatest costs on the system as their consumption is in the morning and \nevening peak periods, and additional capacity and storage needs to be provided to meet these \npeak demands. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Economics and Research Department Technical Note Series Numbers 9 and 10. Manila. \n ", "54  Appendix 13   \n10.  Administrative Efficiency and Good Governance. Tariffs can promote good governance \nin  many  ways.  The  charges  resulting  from  the  tariff  should  be  clear  and  understandable  to \ncustomers, so that they can understand how they might modify their use of the service. Essentially, \nthis means that any classes, categories, and/or blocks used to vary the tariff are predictable and \nnot open to manipulation. Administrative efficiency and good governance require that the amount \npayable by a consumer can be easily calculated and billed. In general, this will depend on whether, \nin the area served, individual consumer connections: (i) take their water from a water company \nconnection, and (ii) have their own water meter. The progressive tariff is only operable where \nhouseholds have individual meters. This is expected by 31 December 2009. \n \n11.  Affordability  and  Universal  Access.  Affordability  is  a  sociopolitical  rather  than  an \neconomic concept, and it relates to enterprises such as water supply and wastewater utilities only if \nthe national or local government so decides. The Kunming domestic tariff meets social objectives \nof ensuring that households meet their basic needs at an affordable price, while the lifeline block \nensures that the poor receive their basic needs at a price they can afford. \n \nC.  Kunming Water and Wastewater Tariff Recommendations \n12.  Water Tariffs. The domestic water tariff provides a lifeline block and a graduated tariff that \nallows poor and average households to meet their needs at prices they can afford. Thereafter, a \nprogressive increase in tariff blocks makes sure that a demand management and conservation \nfunction  ensures  progressive  consumption  is  charged  at  higher  rates.  Above  20  m3/month, \ndomestic households receive no concession and, at the current tariff, would pay more than other \nclasses of customers. Accordingly, Kunming should continue with the present structure, with the \ntop charge in line with other nondomestic tariff categories. All nondomestic customers should be \ncharged the same tariff. There is no economic argument for charging industrial customers less. \nThis  leads  to  economic  inefficiency  and  excess  consumption.  There  are  also  problems  with \nclassification, as customers seek to be classified in customer categories that attract a lower tariff.  \nA rationalization study of non-domestic tariffs will be undertaken by Price Division of Kunming \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  in  2008  in  coordination  with  YDRC  to  move  towards \ngradually equalizing non-domestic tariffs by 2012. \n \n13.  Wastewater Tariffs. KMG should move wastewater tariffs to full cost recovery as soon as \npracticable  to  meet  costs  of  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  loan  for  current \nrehabilitation and expansion projects. KMG should consider setting tariffs on pollutant loading on \nthe basis of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle. As part of the wastewater tariff guidelines study2 carried \nout  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  behalf  of  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  the  following \ncharging mechanisms were evident. For domestic customers, wastewater charges are usually \nbased  on  water  supply  volumes  with  a  uniform  volumetric  charge  applied  per  m3  of  water \nconsumption. For nondomestic customers, wastewater is again charged on the basis of a uniform \nflat fee for wastewater of similar strength to domestic or to some prescribed limit. In most countries \nwhere pollutant loadings are above domestic levels or a prescribed upper limit, customers require \na discharge permit and are charged on the basis of their pollutant loadings. \n \n14.  In Kunming, all customers, including domestic, should be charged a uniform wastewater \ncharge based on domestic strength effluent. For those customer categories with effluent pollutant \nloadings in excess of domestic, they should pay a higher charge reflecting the cost of treating \nhigher pollutant loadings. As in the case of Hong Kong, China, trade waste charges could be \nbased  on  banded  customer  industry  classifications  for  higher  effluent  discharges  applied  to \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

Affordability Analysis of Water and Wastewater Tariffs \n15.  There is no standard poverty line for urban areas in Yunnan Province. Levels of poverty are \nassessed  using  the  number  of  people  below  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme  (MLSS) \nthreshold, which varies from city to city. The average annual disposable income in Kunming in \n2005 was CNY9,616 per capita, compared to CNY8,871 per capita for the whole of Yunnan.3  The \npoverty line in Kunming city is CNY210 per capita per month or CNY2,520 per annum\u2014the \nthreshold for the MLSS subsidy. Some 34,122 people, or 1.4% of the city population of 2.399 \nmillion, benefit from this subsidy and 1.7% of those live in the project area. However, based on \ninformation from the 2005 household survey, the annual per capita income of the bottom 5% of \nhouseholds was CNY2,831, which is just over the annual per capita income threshold for the \nMLSS subsidy.  \n \nTable A13.3: Urban Poverty under Minimum Living Standard Scheme (2005) \nUrban \nPoverty   Poverty  Population in  MLSS \nCounty/District  Population \nNo. HHs  Population  Poverty  (CNY/capita/month) \n(\u2019000) \nKunming (4 districts)  239.9  20,527  34,122  1.4%  210 \nChenggong   4.3  544  919  2.1%  210 \n     Subtotal (Water   244.2  21,071  35,041  1.4%  210 \n     Beneficiary Area) \nSongming  3.5  2,071  2,883  8.2%  183 \nXundian  3.3  1,847  3,860  11.7%  169 \n     Subtotal (Water   6.8  3,918  6,743  9.9%  169\u2013183 \n     Source Area) \nProject Area Total  251  24,989  41,784  1.7%  169\u2013210 \nHH = household, MLSS = minimum living standard scheme. \nSources: Yunnan Province Yearbook 2006, Xundian County Yearbook 2005, and Songming County Yearbook 2005. \n \n16.  Water Consumption. Data provided by the JV indicates that average per capita domestic \nconsumption is about 95 liters per capita per day. However, water restrictions result in some \nsuppressed demand estimated at 5%, resulting in consumption of 100 liters per capita per day or \n8.6 m3/month. The social survey indicated that the poor consume 5 m3 per month, while nonpoor \nhouseholds consume 6.1 m3/month. While the Project does not result in any real increases in \ntariffs, the approved tariff increase of January 2008 will impact consumption, with elasticities \nadopted in the economic analysis used to modify consumption. \n \n17.  KMG  Poverty  Alleviation  Policies.  The  primary  program  supporting  registered  poor \nfamilies is the MLSS designed to maintain a minimum level of income and includes 6 m3 at CNY1.8 \nm3 plus a wastewater tariff of CNY0.75 per month. \n \n18.  Tariff Impacts on Poor Households. The Project will not result in any real increases in \ntariffs  over  those  of  YDRC  approved  tariffs  for  July  2007.  Estimates  were  made  of  monthly \nhousehold water use and the resulting household water and wastewater bill for the categories: (i) \nfor low-income (MLSS lowest 5%), (ii) average of lowest decile (10%), and (iii) average household \n(third  quintile)  based  on  household  size.  Based  on  the  analysis  summarized  in  Table A13.4, \nhouseholds in the lowest income class will not have a problem with affordability of a tariff increase \n                                                 \n3  YPG. 2006.

Mitigation of Tariff Impacts. Poor households have little scope for absorbing even small \ntariff increases given their current allocation of expenditures. The households most likely to be \nadversely affected by the tariff increase are those within the classes of low-income households \nexperiencing the most extreme poverty. Factors contributing to extreme poverty include elevated \nhealth  care  costs  associated  with  poor  health  of  a  household  member,  and  single  person \nhouseholds  where  there  is  no  opportunity  to  share  common  costs  with  other  people.  Such \nhouseholds may require additional support in the face of an increase in their water and wastewater \nbill. The existing 6 m3 at CNY1.8/m3 is targeted and appears to provide the best means of assisting \npoor families. However, it is necessary to ensure that tariffs are affordable to low-income groups. \nThe proportion currently spent on income is 2.0%, which is regarded acceptable. \n \n20.  In the case of nondomestic customer affordability survey by KWSG in 20054 to support their \ntariff application, found that water tariffs accounted for a very small proportion of expenses, so that \nany increase would not cause undue hardship.  While water tariffs to non-domestic sector have \nrisen sharply and reflect the increasing cost of new sources, wastewater tariffs represent the \nrecovery  of  the  costs  of  the  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  of  wastewater.  Presently, \nwastewater tariffs to non-domestic customers are CNY0.90/m3 of water billed. Full cost recovery \ntariffs are of the order of CNY2.0/m3. It is necessary for industry, where they discharge to a water \ncourse to meet the effluent standards, which is consistent with polluter pays principle. Discharging \nto a collection system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant should be a less costly option \nfor most industries, where proper on site inspection and standards are enforced.5 \n                                                 \n4  The water consumption cost accounted for 0.046% and 0.605% of total costs. For example, Camellia Hotel accounted \nfor 0.167%, Acetate Fiber Factory accounted for 0.601%, while Kunming Yunnei Power Co., Ltd. accounted for \n0.046%. KWSG Survey 2005. \n5  Where the Municipal wastewater tariffs are based on polluter pays principles, then industries should only pay charges \nassociated with collection costs and the treatment of their pollutant loading. Given that centralized treatment achieves \neconomies of scale then wastewater tariffs should be affordable, when compared with on-site options of wastewater \ntreatment to meet effluent discharge standards to water courses. However, it is likely that average wastewater tariffs \nfor domestic type biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand concentrations are likely to need to increase to \nCNY 2.0/m3 to achieve full cost recovery. In addition, those industries with industrial standard effluent concentrations \nshould be paying additional charges to meet the specific costs of their effluent treatment. ", "Appendix 14        57         \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The economic analysis of the proposed Project for Kunming city has been carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects.1 The Project is analyzed as \na new bulk water supply to Kunming city, and the new East Development Zone (EDZ) and New \nAirport Development Zone (NADZ). Accordingly, an allowance is made for water treatment, water \ndistribution, meter reading and billing, and payment of water resource fees so that the cost of the \nraw water supply project can be directly related to willingness to pay. \n \nB.  Rationale of the Project \n2.  The water sector continues to be a priority sector under the 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u2013\n2010). The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; (ii) protecting existing \nsources  by  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution  in  rivers,  lakes,  and  reservoirs; \n(iii) controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  and  (iv)  improving  demand \nmanagement with the introduction of water saving technology, more efficient operations, and the \nadoption of appropriate pricing mechanisms. Under water conservation and energy saving policies, \nKunming is encouraged to develop effluent reuse, rainwater harvesting, and recycling practices to \nmitigate overall raw water demand. \n \n3.  The provision of new supply from the Project will provide water supply for the NADZ and \nEDZ, improve water security for  Kunming North, alleviate the stress and overuse of existing \nreservoirs, and help reduce any demand to utilize groundwater. This will also enable any conflict \nwith declared government policy\u2014environment protection, groundwater protection, reduction in \npumping\u2014to be avoided. A potential benefit of using less water from the small catchments that \nfeed Dianchi Lake is that flow through the lake would be partially restored, helping to stabilize if not \nactually lead to an improvement in the lake\u2019s environmental condition. \n \n4.  Based on projected growth and future water demand for Kunming and new development \nzones, and after assessment of existing water sources (quantity and quality), there is clearly an \nidentified need for Kunming to develop new water sources in the near future. Of the identified \nalternatives available for development, Qingshuihai was evaluated as the best least-cost option. \nThe Project will also be: (i) beneficial for Kunming by supporting urban development and economic \ngrowth; (ii) positive for overall public health, sanitation, and the well-being of beneficiaries; and \n(iii) provide opportunities to relieve the environmental stress on local groundwater sources and \nsurface sources. \n \nC.  Economic Assumptions \n5.  For the present study, the following assumptions are adopted: (i) all costs are expressed in \nearly 2007 prices, and (ii) civil works and bulk transmission facilities/pipelines are assumed to have \na useful economic life of 50 years after construction. Residual values are assumed in year 20 for \nreservoir assets of 30 years of the assumed 50-year life. The real opportunity cost of capital \nemployed in the economic analysis is assumed to be 12% per annum. Capital costs include \nphysical contingencies but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction (as a result \nof any debt financing). Taxes and duties are assumed at 3.3% for civil works and other structures \nand  14.5%  for  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment.  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  are \nassumed  at  1.5%  of  project  capital  costs,  with  labor  costs  assumed  for  88  persons  at \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n ", "58  Appendix 14   \nCNY4.44 million per annum, a water resource fee at CNY0.23 per cubic meter (m3) of water supply \nand an allowance for incremental water treatment and water distribution costs, and meter reading \nand billing of CNY1.03/m3 of water sales. \n \nD.  Least Cost Analysis \n6.  A Kunming city long-term water supply plan was prepared in 1994 and reviewed in 2003. \nThe plan assessed 14 options or combined options for water delivery. Most options were rejected \nbecause (i) water quality at source was below drinking water standards, (ii) assured water source \nvolume was insufficient to provide adequate alternative water supply without combination with \nother options, and (iii) electricity pumping cost was too high. \n \n7.  As  a  result  of  the  2003  review,  four  primary  options  (Fenglongwan,  Niulangjiang, \nQingshuihai, and Zhangjiuhe) were identified. Of these, Qingshuihai was initially favored on a \nleast-cost basis (low unit costs for water and no pumping) but administrative issues related to \nQingshuihai could not be resolved (Xundian and Songming counties were not then a part of \nKunming municipality). For administrative reasons, Zhangjiuhe was chosen over Qingshuihai for \nimplementation under Japan Bank for International Cooperation and was commissioned in April \n2007. The discounted costs per m3 over a 20-year period at a 12% discount rate are CNY1.90 for \nZhangjiuhe, CNY1.85 for Qingshuihai, and CNY2.41 for Fenglongwan. Accordingly, Qingshuihai is \nnow regarded the least-cost option for proposed water resource development. \n \nE.  Water Demand Projections \n8.  Future water demand projection for the period 2006\u20132020 has been prepared in line with \nADB guidelines which relate demand to expected future increases in income and changes in water \ntariffs for domestic consumption assuming 100 liters per capita per day, and the equivalent of \n175 liters per capita per day for nondomestic consumption. The population of Kunming is projected \nto increase from 2.76 million in 2006 to 3.1 million in 2020, at less than 1% per annum. Population \ngrowth in Kunming is based on EDZ population increasing from 0.16 million in 2006 to 0.95 million \nin 2020, and NADZ population increasing from around 20,000 (predominantly rural) in 2006 to \n180,000 by 2020. On this basis, the projected additional raw water requirement for Kunming, EDZ, \nand NADZ would be about 107 million m3/year by 2015, rising to an estimated 149.0 million \nm3/year  by  2020,  even  after  allowing  for  improved  water  supply,  treatment,  and  distribution \nefficiencies through to 2020. In practice, Kunming municipal government (KMG) is likely to reduce \nthe use of existing water sources and utilize the better quality water available from Qingshuihai \nfrom 2013. The overall future water supply and demand for Kunming and the new development \nzones is summarized in Table A14.1. Details are in Supplementary Appendixes A and M. \n \nTable A14.1: Summary of Water Demand and Supply Balance, 2007\u20132020 \n  2007  2010  2015  2020 \nArea Water Demand  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3)  (million m3) \nKunming Main City  404.0  415.8  398.8  408.3 \nEastern Development Zone  29.4  52.4  88.6  125.3 \nNew Airport Development Zone  0.0  9.2  18.5  23.7 \n     Total Water Demand  433.4  477.4  505.9  557.3 \nWater Availability with Qingshuihai   459.9  487.1  558.0  558.0 \n     Net Projected Balance   26.1  9.8  52.0  0.7 \nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSources: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited, Yunnan Design Research Institute and project preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n ", "Appendix 14        59         \nF.  Raw Water Fees for Reservoir Operations and Management, Catchment Protection \n9.  The tariff provides for the payment of raw water fees made up of a water resource fee of \nCNY0.23/m3  and  a  water  management  fee  of  CNY0.20/m3.  These  fees  are  levied  on  water \nsupplied to water treatment plant. The water management fee is transferred to the reservoir \noperator to meet operation and maintenance costs, while the water resource fee is transferred to \nProvincial and Municipal Finance Bureaus to be used for compensation to affected persons in the \ncatchment areas because of change to environment-friendly farming practices. \n \n10.  In respect to reservoir management, the Qingshuihai feasibility study report provided for \nstaff of 88 persons and 1.5% of capital costs for reservoir operation and maintenance (O&M). This \nrepresents CNY26  million per annum, or a fee of CNY0.25/m3. Benchmarking material costs \nagainst Australian experiences indicates that this fee would be adequate to meet O&M costs over \nthe first half (25 years) of the assets\u2019 lives. Capacity development also provides for Kunming Water \nSupply Group Company Limited to prepare a detailed budget to support an application to KMG for \nthe level of fee necessary to support adequate O&M for Qingshuihai reservoir. \n \n11.  The  water  resource  fee  (50%  represents  CNY12.0  million  per  annum)  transferred  to \nKunming Financial Bureau will be used directly to support compensation policies for affected \npersons in the watershed area, where adopting more environment-friendly policies would lead to \nloss of income. In addition, ongoing KMG programs and subsidies can be applied to affected \npersons to compensate them for adopting more environment-friendly farming practices and/or \npoverty alleviation measures. It is unnecessary to establish a specific project fund for this purpose \nunder the Project. ADB will encourage KMG to provide a comprehensive program of compensation \nand support. \n \nG.  Project Benefits \n12.  Benefits are associated with the improvement in water supply treatment and distribution \nservices and include the provision of a 24-hour service in areas currently experiencing interrupted \nservice, increased security of supply, improved drinking water quality, improvements in system \npressure, reduced risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens in delivered tap water, and reductions \nin non-revenue water. \n \n13.  Water  supply  benefits  are  estimated  using  a  willingness  to  pay  approach.  Consumer \nwillingness to pay for water was estimated for domestic consumers through contingent valuation \napproach as part of the socioeconomic survey. The value of domestic water was estimated based \non expected improvement in present water quality and the increased quantity of water that will be \nprovided in the future. The value of present quality water was taken as the CNY2.8/m3 tariff now \npaid, which includes CNY0.75/m3 for wastewater. Respondents were then asked how they felt \nabout the approved rise of 20% in the tariff on 1 July 2007 to CNY3.2/m3 tariff, which includes \nCNY0.75/m3 for wastewater. The value of higher quality water was taken from household survey \ndata, which indicated that people on average were willing to pay CNY4.35/m3 for such water \nbecause of increased observed quality and expected increases in quantity. \n \n14.  In the case of nondomestic customers, which have also faced severe quota restrictions, \nwith quotas being reduced to service domestic areas, over the last 3 drought years, it is assumed \nthat their willingness to pay for improved water quality and volumes would be at least as high as \ndomestic customers, i.e., a minimum of 36% above the proposed tariffs. This would equate to a \nwillingness-to-pay  tariff  of  CNY5.76/m3  based  on  a  proposed  average  nondomestic  tariff  of \nCNY4.24/m3 by 1 July 2007. This fits within the range of the value of industrial water estimated \n ", "60  Appendix 14   \nfrom the value added to industrial output by water input.2 The estimate for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) as a whole was CNY5/m3 in 2002; for northern PRC, the average was CNY6.32. \n \n15.  The willingness to pay results reflect the provision of treated potable water to urban users. \nTo determine the share of willingness to pay that can be attributed to the raw water source, it is \nnecessary to deduct the share of the benefit related to water treatment and distribution. This has \nbeen achieved by calculating the average incremental economic cost for potable water and for raw \nwater, by deducting the costs of water treatment and distribution amounting to CNY1.03/m3. The \nresults are summarized below, and demonstrate that 78% of the willingness-to-pay value can be \nallocated to the raw water source over the life of the Project. The benefit attributed to the Project is \nCNY3.38/m3. \n \nH.  Summary of Economic Analysis Results \n16.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 20.1%. The EIRR of the \nProject exceeds 12%. The net present value at 12% is CNY1,084.1 million. An analysis to test the \nsensitivity of the EIRR of the water supply projects to adverse changes in key variables was \nundertaken. The Project is most sensitive to delays that may result in real capital cost increases \nand  a  delay  in  benefits,  as  the  plant  is  commissioned  later.  In  particular,  a  project-specific \nsensitivity that reflects cost increases and delays demonstrates that a 2-year delay with 20% cost \nincreases results in the EIRR declining to 16.2%. Although the EIRR is still well above 12%, efforts \nmust  be  made  in  project  implementation  to  avoid  such  delays  and  cost  increases.  Where \ngroundwater use continues at half of 2007 levels rather than eliminated, the EIRR falls to 16.5% as \nutilization of Qingshuihai is delayed. Where the willingness to pay of nondomestic users was \nreduced by 50%, the EIRR falls to 15.1%. \n \nTable A14.2: Qingshuihai Project EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \nSensitivity Analysis    EIRR  SIa  SVb \nBase Case    20.1%       \nCapital  +10%  18.8%  6.5%  61.9% \nOperating  +10%  19.9%  0.8%  524.1% \nBenefits  -10%  18.5%  8.0%  -50.4% \nAll the above  17.1%      \n2-year delay with 20% increase in CAPEX  16.2%       \nGroundwater use continues at 30 million m3/year  16.5%     \nWillingness to pay of nondomestic reduced by 50%  15.1%     \nEOCC     12.0%       \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, EOCC = economic opportunity cost of capital, m3 \n= cubic meter, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \na   Sensitivity indicator is the ratio of percentage change in the net present value (NPV) to the percentage change in a \nvariable. A high value for this indicator indicates project sensitivity to the variable.  \nb  Switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost item (decline in a benefit item) required for the NPV to \nbecome zero (which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12%).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n2  As estimated by Hua Wang and Somik Lall of the World Bank\u2019s Development Research Group, 2002.
