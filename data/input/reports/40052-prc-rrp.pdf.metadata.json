A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment \nwas  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of \nDirectors and uploaded onto the ADB website on 26 June 2007. \n \nThe  Project  is  a  key  urban  infrastructure  initiative  of  Kunming \nmunicipal  government  (KMG).  It  will  provide  safe,  secure  water \nsupply  and  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  of  the  city  of \nKunming.  The  Project  will  help  Kunming  to  (i)  ensure  better  raw \nthe  new \nwater  quantity  and  quality \ndevelopment  zones;  (ii)  protect  water  resources;  (iii)  encourage \nmore  effective  water  demand  management;  (iv)  strengthen \nintegrated  water \nresources  development  and  environmental \nmanagement;  (v)  improve  the  environment,  living  conditions,  and \npublic  health  standards;  and  (vi)  ensure  effective  corporate \ngovernance and enterprise reform to improve sector efficiency.  \n \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components  (i)  water  resources \ndevelopment,  (ii)  water  conveyance  systems,  and  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment  and  project  management.  The  Project  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program  (2006\u20132010)  to  improve \nliving conditions and health in the cities of the PRC, and to promote \ntheir  sustainable  economic  development.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  7, \ntarget 10, which calls for halving by 2015 the proportion of people \nwithout  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation.  The \nProject is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n \nYunnan  provincial  government  and  KMG  have  identified  a  priority \nlist  of  investment  projects  covering  water  supply  and  wastewater \nmanagement  and  environmental  improvement  projects  that  will \nhelp  to  improve  the  urban  environment,  reduce  water  pollution  of \nreservoirs  and \nlong-term  sustainable \ndevelopment in Kunming. In the medium term, a better quality and \nlow-cost  water  supply  source  is  needed  to  meet  the  projected \nwater demand of Kunming. Without these measures, Kunming will \nhave  to  revert  to  the  use  of  the  highly  polluted  water  sources  of \nDianchi Lake with class V water quality. The polluted water source \nremains a threat to public health, apart from being costly to treat. \n \n\nlakes,  and  ensure \n\n\fii \n\n(NADZ) \n\nto  watershed \n\nthrough  policy  reform, \n\nimproved  water  and  urban \n\nTo support these developments, additional raw water supplies are \nrequired. The existing water supply, without using Dianchi Lake, is \nprojected  to  be  fully  utilized  within  the  existing  city  because  of \npopulation  growth  and \nthe  related  urban,  commercial,  and \nindustrial  development  through  to  2010  and  beyond.  The  New \nAirport  Development  Zone \nis  a  new  greenfield \ndevelopment  area  that  has  no  substantial  local  water  supply \nsource. Because of topography, it can only be supplied with water \nfrom the existing city system by pumping, which is contrary to the \nexpressed policy for energy saving. NADZ will be developed from \n2007  onwards,  to  have  a  projected  population  of  70,000  in  2010 \nand 180,000 in 2020. Development of the East Development Zone \n(EDZ)  has  already  started,  but  the  provision  of  adequate  water \nsupply will soon be a significant constraint as the population grows \nto 390,000 by 2010, and 950,000 by 2020. \n \nKMG  has  accorded  priority  in  its  11th  Five-Year  Program  to \nincreased \naddressing  water  scarcity \ninvestment,  and \ninfrastructure \nmanagement.  KMG\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  protecting  drinking \nwater  sources  by  controlling  upstream  water  pollution,  industrial \npollution,  and  other  point  and  nonpoint  sources  in  urban  areas; \nand  management; \n(ii) support \n(iii) introducing  water  and  energy  efficient \ntechnologies  and \noperations;  and  (iv)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to \nencourage  water  conservation  and  generate  the  necessary  funds \nfor  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  economic  and  enterprise  reform  programs,  KMG \nhas  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  water  supply  and  wastewater \nprojects are financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  the  critical  water  requirements  of  KMG \nbeyond  2012.  The  Project  will  provide  111  million  cubic  meters \n(m3)  of  water  annually  to  meet  the  demand  of  Kunming  city, \n104 million  m3  for  EDZ  and  NADZ,  and  7  million  m3  for  Xundian \nCounty  from  2012.  In  both  zones,  residents  currently  depend \nlargely  on  water  from  springs  and  wells  to  supply  water  to  their \nhomes by village-level systems for domestic use.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  environment,  public \nhealth,  and  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  of  Kunming;  and \nsustained economic development of the city through the provision \nof safe and reliable water supply. The outcome of the Project is the \nprovision of more efficient, reliable, affordable, safe, and clean raw \nwater  supply;  and  effective  protection  and  management  of  water \nresources in Kunming (contributing to the achievement of MDG 7, \ntarget 10).  \n \n\nprotection \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan   The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $255.9  million  equivalent, \n\n \n\nincluding taxes and duties. \n \n\n\fiii \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nKunming Municipal Government \nLocal Bank  \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million \nequivalent) \n80.0 \n76.8 \n99.1 \n255.9 \n\nPercent \n\n31.3 \n30.0 \n38.7 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $80  million  to  finance \nabout  31.3%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Provincial  and  municipal \ngovernments  will  provide  equity  equivalent  to  $76.8  million,  or \n30.0%  of  total  project  cost.  The  balance  of  $99.1  million  (38.7%) \nwill  be  provided  by  a  domestic  loan  from  the  Agricultural  Bank  of \nChina. The ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources. \nThe loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  for  US  dollar  loans,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loan \nwill have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to \nYunnan  provincial  government,  which  will  onlend \nloan \nproceeds  to  KMG,  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of \nthe  ADB  loan.  The  loan  proceeds  will  then  be  onlent  to  Kunming \nWater Supply Group Company Limited (KWSG) on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2013 \n \n31 December 2012 \n\nthe \n\n \nA  project  leading  group  (PLG)  will  be  responsible  for  project \ncoordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during \nimplementation.

Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost \n$100,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures.  \n \nProvision  has  been  made \nfor  about  18  person-months  of \ninternational and 72 person-months of national consulting services, \nto  be  funded  under  the  Project  to  support  the  PMO  and \nimplementing  agency  in  project  implementation  and  capacity \ndevelopment. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in \naccordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nusing  full  technical  proposal  procedures.  A  fixed  quality-cost  ratio \nof  80:20  will  be  applied.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  (i) \n(ii) \nproject  management \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  setup  of  project \nperformance  management  system;  (iii) safeguards  management \nand  monitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and  business  planning;  (v)  tariff \nreview; (vi) dam and reservoir management, safety, and operation; \n(vii) online water quality monitoring; and (viii) development of public \nawareness training on water demand measures and social impact \nmonitoring.  \n \nThe  Project  supports \nfor \nenvironmental  sustainability  (Goal  7),  which  aims  to  halve  the \nproportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (target  10).  The  Project  will \ndirectly benefit about 3.4 million people living in the project areas, \nof  whom  about  6.9%  are  poor.  All  the  residents  of  Kunming  will \nbenefit indirectly, as their living conditions will improve as  a result \nof (i) improved water quality and quantity; (ii) improved security of \nwater supply, which will mean less likelihood of rationing in drought \nyears; (iii) reduced use of polluted water sources; and (iv) reduced \nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  the  associated  reduction  in \nmedical  costs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  lead  to  employment \ncreation  during  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities. \nHealth  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by \nwomen  and  children.  Value-added  features  include  supporting  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  joint  venture  between  KWSG  and \nVeolia  for  water  treatment  and  distribution  in  Kunming  through \nensuring  KMG\u2019s  stricter  enforcement  of  \u201cone  household,  one \nmeter\u201d  policy,  and  supporting  KMG  to  move  towards  uniform \nnondomestic  tariffs  and  to  continue  to  monitor  the  price  subsidies \nand  lifeline  tariff  to  cushion  the  impact  of  tariff  increases  on  the \npoor.  Further,  the  Project  shall  undertake  corporate  governance \nreform  through  the  introduction  of  water  users\u2019  representative  in \nthe  board  of  directors  of  KWSG,  and  improving  managerial \ncapacity  of  KWSG  in  dam/reservoir  management,  safety,  and \noperation.  The  Project  will  implement  capacity  development  of \n\nthe  achievement  of \n\nthe  MDG \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  no  unusual \n\nv \n\nfinancial  management  and  project  performance \nKWSG  on \nmanagement  system,  safeguards  management  and  monitoring, \ncorporate  and  business  planning,  tariff  review,  dam  and  reservoir \nmanagement, safety and operation, online water quality monitoring \nand  public  awareness  on  water  demand  measures,  and  social \nimpact monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  for  about  4,200  people  in \nconstruction  work  each  year  for  5  years,  and  an  additional \n10,920 people will be employed annually in jobs created indirectly \nas a result of construction. It is estimated that at least 50% of the \nconstruction  jobs  will  be  unskilled,  and  the  poor  should  benefit \ndisproportionately from this job creation. The Project will contribute \nto  the  prevention  of  up  to  an  estimated  1.5  million  cases  of \nwaterborne  diseases  from  2013  to  2020,  and  the  associated \nincrease  in  median  medical  costs  is  estimated  to  be  likely  to  rise \nfrom  CNY18  to  CNY30  per  capita  (at  current  values)  by  2020. \nHealth  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by \nwomen since they are more at risk of waterborne diseases, and by \nchildren, who have least resistance to such diseases.  \n \n\ntimely \n\ntechnical \n\nfollowing  risks  could  affect \n\nrisks.  Conventional \nengineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  safety  and  reliability \nwill be adopted for water storage and transfer (tunneling) systems. \nDuring  project  implementation,  consultants  and  dam  technical \nspecialists  will  support  the  PMO  and  implementing  agency  to \nensure that equipment and works comply with design requirements \nand  quality  standards.  Further,  the  Yunnan  Design  and  Research \nInstitute is now undertaking substantive on-ground and subsurface \nsurveys  to  quantify  the  potential  risks  more  fully  prior  to  finalizing \nthe conveyance system alignment. \n \nimplementation  and \nThe \neconomic viability, and reduce the intended benefits of the Project: \n(i)  failure  to  implement  the  projects  on  water  treatment  and \nwastewater  treatment  plant  capacity  within  the  new  development \nzones  by  the  time  of  project  completion/commissioning;  (ii)  failure \nof  KMG \nto  utilize \nto  prevent  groundwater  use  completely \nQingshuihai  water  supply  fully  as  soon  as  it  becomes  available \n(given the additional capital costs of Qingshuihai water, and if this \nwill not be fully utilized, this would put pressure on tariffs to cover \ndebt  servicing);  (iii)  failure  of  KMG  to  increase  tariffs  to  meet  the \ncost  recovery  targets,  considering  the  impact  of  comprehensive \nsector  investments;  and  (iv)  failure  of  KMG  to  undertake  detailed \nstudies and surveys on catchment areas and formulate regulations \nfor the Project\u2019s water resources protection.  \n \nRisk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  through  assurances  from  KMG  on  the \nprovision  of  the  water  treatment  and  wastewater  treatment  plant \ncapacities \nimplementation  and \ncommissioning.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  \n\nto  coordinate  with  project \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nassurances  from  KMG  on  improving  control  and  regulation  of \ngroundwater use, imposing additional charges on groundwater use \nin  excess  of  water  tariffs  to  discourage  groundwater  use,  and \nregular  tariff  reviews  and  adjustments.  Risk  (iv)  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  assurance  that  KMG  shall  develop  a  pollution  inventory, \nand  establish  a  catchment  modeling  system,  which  will  form  the \nbasis  for  prioritization  of  Qingshuihai  reservoir  protection  options \nand development of an environmental monitoring program.  \n\n\fo\n99  00'E\n\n104  00'Eo\n\nKUNMING QINGSHUIHAI WATER SUPPLY

on a proposed loan to \n\n1. \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply Project.  \n \nIn line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of improving living conditions, providing \n2. \nsafe and reliable water supply, protecting water resources, and enhancing effective water demand \nmanagement, the Government of the PRC (the Government) requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) assistance in implementing the water resource development project in Kunming. The Project \nis consistent with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) (2006\u20132010), ADB\u2019s water policy,1 and \nwill  help  the  PRC  to  achieve  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  7,  target  10,  which  calls  for \nhalving,  by  2015,  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  improved \nsanitation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSince the PRC initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has \naccompanied high levels of economic growth. The urban population has nearly tripled from about \n190  million  in  1980  to  more  than  560  million  in  2005,  and  accounts  for  more  than  43%  of  the \nnational  population.  Urbanization  increased  1.4%  annually  from  2001  to  2005  and  it  is  projected \nthat the urban population will reach 45% of the total population by 2010, 49% by 2015, and 55% by \n2020. Urban growth and industrialization will considerably increase the need for water supply and \nsanitation services, and the investments required to provide these services. The growing need for \nbasic  urban  services  resulting  from  urban  population  increase,  rapid  industrialization,  and \neconomic  development  is  increasingly  constraining  the  physical  and  financial  capacity  of  most \ncities to provide adequate water infrastructure for delivery of a clean and safe water supply.   \n \n4. \nMany cities are facing challenges related to managing resource scarcity and environmental \nconcerns. Recognizing the impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment, the Government has \nsupported environmentally sustainable development through policy and pricing reforms, increased \ninvestment, and improved urban infrastructure management. It continues to address critical water \nresources  constraints  and  water  supply  facilities  that  limit  development.  The  Government  has \nemphasized  the  need  for  improvement  in  water  resources  management,  demand  management, \nand  complementary  investment  in  water-related  infrastructure  with  increasing  attention  to  water \npolicy, planning, management, and conservation. These principles were included in the amended \nNational Water Law, 2002; Law on Water and Soil Conservation, 1991; and Law on Prevention and \nControl of Water Pollution, 1996.2 \n \nMunicipal water supply in PRC cities has increased steadily since 1990s, reaching a service \n5. \ncoverage  ratio  of  64%  in  2000  and  91%  in  2005.  Access to  piped  water  supply  in  major  cities  is \nexpected to reach 95% by 2010 and 100% in 2015 in accordance with MDG 7, target 10. However, \nthese  high  service  coverage  rates  do  not  reflect  the  water  shortages  occurring  in  most  cities \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The National Water Law included the following basic principles: (i) water is a strategic resource and lifeline for social \nand  economic  development;  (ii)  the  focus  needs  to  be  shifted  from  a  construction  orientation  to  a  management \norientation; (iii) conserve the quantity and maintain quality of water; (iv) optimize planning/allocation/use, conservation, \nand  protection  of  water  rather  than  maximum  utilization;  (v)  combine  structural  and  nonstructural  measures; \n(vi) increase demand management, and not entirely depend on supply augmentation; (vii) treat water as an economic \ngood and price it accordingly; (viii) establish a functioning water rights and discharge control system; (ix) people need \nto live in harmony with nature and not only exploit it; and (x) place more emphasis on comprehensive integrated water \nresources management. \n\n\f2 \n\ncaused  by  lack  of  good  quality  raw  water,  inefficiencies  in  water  distribution,  and  inadequacy  in \nwastewater  management  and  treatment  capacities.  Currently,  two  thirds  of  all  PRC  cities  do  not \nhave enough water all year round. Supply is not keeping pace with increasing demand caused by \nrapid  urbanization,  shortage  of  available  water  resources,  increasing  water  pollution,  and \noverextraction  of  groundwater  acquifer.  Hence,  about  420  out  of  651  municipalities  have  been \nclassified  \u201cwater  short\u201d,  of  which  110  municipalities  have  serious  water  problems  and \n14 municipalities are critically short of water. \n \n6. \nThe Government has identified the water sector as a priority since 2000 and recognizes the \nwater  issues  confronting  the  sector\u2014water  shortages,  flooding,  and  water  pollution.  To  address \nwater shortages, the Government has developed a strategy with focus on: (i) developing suitable \nwater  sources,  (ii)  protecting  existing  water  resources  by  controlling  point  and  nonpoint  pollution, \nand  (iii)  effective  water  demand  management.  Overexploitation  of  groundwater  and  overuse  of \nsurface water has resulted in inadequate environmental flows along with groundwater and surface \nwater pollution contributing to the decline of water resources. Watersheds and upper catchments \nhave been degraded because of pressures from economic activities, resulting in deforestation and \ninadequate  agricultural  and  soil  management  practices.  The  main  challenges  are  to  halt \ngroundwater  overexploitation  and  surface  water  overextraction,  restrict  and  control  pollution, \nincrease  the  levels  of  flood  protection,  and  stabilize  watersheds.  Without  a  concerted  effort  to \nimprove  water  resources  management,  the  damage  to  the  environment  will  become  irreversible, \nwith a substantial negative impact on the quality of life of the people and the economy. \n \n7. \nKunming  is  the  capital  city;  and  the  political,  economic,  and  cultural  center  of  Yunnan \nProvince.  The  city  covers  a  total  land  area  of  21,111  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  had  a  total \npopulation of 5.08 million in 2005 with average annual growth of 6.5% during 2001\u20132005. In 2005, \nKunming\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  reached  CNY106.23  billion.  Kunming  is  strategically \nlocated  and  is  a  focal  point  for  the  PRC\u2019s  regional  development  strategy  in  the  southwestern \nprovinces. In Kunming\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), the strategy is for Kunming to become a \nregional  hub  and  gateway  for  the  PRC\u2019s  trade  and  cultural  relations  with  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Greater Mekong Subregion. Consequently, Kunming city is \nset  for  further  rapid  expansion.  The  current  Kunming  municipal  government  (KMG)  urban \ndevelopment  plan3 is  centered  on  revitalization  of  the  old  city,  with  migration  of  government  and \neducation  institutions  to  a  new  East  Development  Zone  (EDZ)  and  the  establishment  of  a  New \nAirport Development Zone (NADZ).4 Kunming is urbanizing rapidly,  and there is growing  demand \nfor  urban  and  water  infrastructure  and  services.  This  has  taken  its  toll  on  the  environment  and \nwater  supply  resources,  and  has  challenged  the  capacity  of  KMG  to  promote  good  governance, \neffective planning and management, sustainable financing, and timely delivery of public services. \n \n8. \nThe  planning  and  development  of  new  water  resources  has  not  kept  pace  with  rapid \npopulation and economic growth, particularly in Kunming which is declared a water shortage area. \nThe lack of a cohesive water resources protection and demand management in Kunming, as well \nas widespread pollution, have caused the quality of current water sources to deteriorate to levels \nthat make them unacceptable for further water use. Kunming\u2019s major water sources, Dianchi Lake \nand Songhuaba reservoirs, are experiencing problems with upstream pollution. Dianchi Lake water \n\n                                                 \n3   Summary of Modern New Kunming Water and Wastewater Master Plan; Medium Term Construction Plan for Kunming \nMain  City,  2006\u20132010;  Long  Term  Development  Plan  for  Kunming  New  Airport  Development  Zone  (NADZ),  (2006\u2013\n2020). \n\n4   EDZ  is  a  new  industrial  and  education  zone,  with  an  area  of  107  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  population  of  0.95 \nmillion.  NADZ,  with  an  area  of  160  km2  and  population  of  0.40  million,  is  planned  as  the  regional  transport  and  air \nlogistics hub to link Kunming with ASEAN countries and South Asia.   \n\n\f3 \n\nis  class  V5 and  needs  treatment  to  meet  adequate  drinking  standards.  Songhuaba  reservoir  is \nbecoming  polluted  from  agricultural  pollutants,  and  the  groundwater  source  is  experiencing \noverextraction. Other reservoirs (Baoxianghe, Chaihe, Dahe, and Shalang) are inadequate to meet \nlocal water demand. Without significant investment in new water resources development and water \nresource protection and management, the quality of life for urban residents will decline, the urban \nenvironment will deteriorate, and the sustainability of economic development will be put at risk. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProject Background. KMG is committed to the development and growth of Kunming as a \n9. \nregional economic and communications hub, with close links with member nations of ASEAN and \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  This  growth  will  encourage  further  commercial  activity  and \npopulation increase, leading to an increase in overall water demand in Kunming city. Further, the \nNADZ and Chenggong EDZ, which are integral components of KMG\u2019s \u201cNew Kunming\u201d Master Plan \nthrough to 2030, also need secure and stable water supply. \n \n10.  With increased urbanization, industrialization, and concomitant water shortages, Kunming\u2019s \neconomy  will  be  severely  affected  without  the  provision  of  additional  water  supply.  Hence,  KMG, \nsince  1994,  has  identified  and  evaluated  14  water  source  alternatives,  including  the  recently \ncommissioned Zhangjiuhe Water Supply Project (Japan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] \n2002\u20132007),  as  alternatives  to  using  polluted  water  from  Dianchi  Lake.  However,  even  with  the \nZhangjiuhe  project,  and  after  ceasing  the  use  of  Dianchi  water,  shortage  is  projected  to  occur  in \nKunming with the new development zones in 2010. KMG would prefer to avoid having to use the \nDianchi water, which is class V and costly to treat to make it suitable for drinking. Further use will \ncontribute  to  its  further  environmental  decline,  as  it  will  reduce  the  thorough  flow  of  water  in  the \nLake.  By  2010,  Kunming  will  need  additional  water  supply,  sufficient  for  continued  growth  and \ndevelopment in the future. Among the alternatives evaluated, Kunming Qingshuihai Water Supply \nProject, which is gravity-fed and can provide class II water, will address Kunming\u2019s water shortage \nby 2012 and is considered the least-cost option. An analysis of the water sector is in Appendix 2, \nand details are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n11. \nProject  Rationale.  Yunnan  provincial  government  (YPG)  and  KMG  have  identified  a \npriority  list  of  investment  projects  covering  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  and \nenvironmental improvement projects that will help to improve the urban environment, reduce water \npollution of reservoirs and lakes, and ensure long-term sustainable development in Kunming. In the \nmedium  term,  a  better  quality  and  low-cost  water  supply  source  is  needed  to  meet  the  projected \nwater demand of Kunming. Without these measures, Kunming will have to revert to the use of the \nhighly polluted water sources of Dianchi Lake with class V water quality. The polluted water source \nremains a threat to public health apart from being costly to treat. \n \nTo  support  these  development  zones,  additional  raw  water  supplies  are  required.  The \n12. \nexisting water supply, without using Dianchi Lake, is projected to be fully utilized within the existing \ncity because of population growth and the related urban, commercial, and industrial development \nthrough  to  2010  and  beyond.  The  NADZ  is  a  new  greenfield  development  area  that  has  no \nsubstantial  local  water  supply  source.  Because  of  topography,  it  can  only  be  supplied  with  water \nfrom  the  existing  city  system  by  pumping,  which  is  contrary  to  the  expressed  policy  for  energy \nsaving. The NADZ will be developed from 2007 onwards, to have a projected population of 70,000 \n\n                                                 \n5   The PRC environmental quality standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is the \nbest in quality and class V is the worst. Class I is for water resources and nationally protected water bodies. Class II is \nfor high-value fish protection areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class I, II, and III can be \nused for potable water resources. Class IV is for general industrial water sources and noncontact recreational areas. \nClass V is suitable only for agricultural use. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nin  2010  and  180,000  in  2020.  Development  of  the  EDZ  has  already  started,  but  the  provision  of \nadequate water supply will soon be a significant constraint as the population grows to 390,000 by \n2010, and 950,000 by 2020. \n \nThe  KMG  has  accorded  priority  in  its  11th  Five-Year  Plan  to  addressing  water  scarcity \n13. \nthrough  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and  improved  water  and  urban  infrastructure \nmanagement.  KMG\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  protecting  drinking  water  sources  by  controlling \nupstream water pollution, industrial pollution, and other point and nonpoint sources in urban areas; \n(ii)  support  to  watershed  protection  and  management;  (iii)  introducing  water  and  energy  efficient \ntechnologies  and  operations;  and  (iv)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to  encourage  water \nconservation and generate the necessary funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. In line \nwith the Government\u2019s economic and enterprise reform programs, KMG has taken steps to ensure \nthat water supply and wastewater projects are financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \n \n14. \nThe Project will address the critical water requirements of KMG beyond 2012. The Project \nwill provide 104 million cubic meters (m3) of water to meet the demand of Kunming city EDZ and \nNADZ, and 7 million m3 for Xundian County from 2012. In both zones, residents currently depend \nlargely on water from springs and wells to supply water to their homes by village-level systems for \ndomestic use.  \n \nTo address water scarcity and achieve the water recycling rate of 20% for Kunming to be \n15. \ndeclared a National Water Conservation City by 2020,6  KMG is implementing multiple and cross-\nsectoral  interventions.  These  include  (i)  promoting  appropriate  technologies  for  water  delivery, \nconservation,  reuse,  pollution  control,  domestic  and  industrial  recycling,  and  rainwater  use; \n(ii) further reduction and eventual restriction on the use of groundwater; (iii) innovative educational \nmeans  to  motivate  present  and  future  users  to  monitor  consumption  and  conserve  water;  and \n(iv) formulating  regulations  concerning \nthe  monitoring  and  management  of  surface  and \ngroundwater, pollution control in water bodies, and incentives for wastewater reuse. It is currently \nimplementing  the  \u201cone  household,  one  meter\u201d  policy,  which  will  enable  Kunming  Water  Supply \nGroup Company Limited (KWSG) to reduce non-revenue water from 38% to 20% by 2015. \n \n16. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  Building  on  policy  dialogue  with  the  PRC  under  previous  ADB-funded \nurban  development  projects,  the  Project  will  engage  in  policy  dialogue  with  KMG  in  several  key \nareas: (i) cost recovery and tariff reforms; (ii) sustainable integrated water resources development, \nprotection,  and  environmental  management;  (iii)  integrated  water  resources  and  water  demand \nmanagement;  (iv)  regulatory  enforcement  and  monitoring  for  environmental  management; \n(v) corporate  governance  and  enterprise  reform;  and  (vi)  private  sector  participation  (PSP).  KMG \nhas  endorsed  medium-  and  long-term  water  supply  strategies,  and  developed  master  plans  and \nenvironmental management programs, including measures on the prevention and control of point \nand  nonpoint  pollution  on  water  bodies.  These  plans  and  programs  are  formulated  to  ensure \nsustainable  economic  development  without  jeopardizing  the  environment  and  living  conditions  in \nKunming.  \n \n17. \nSupporting an integrated approach to urban development and environmental management \nhas been a key element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue and operational activities. Policy dialogue on key \nreforms is a significant aspect of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC, and ADB has supported the tariff \nreform  process  through  three  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  which  have  contributed \n\n                                                 \n6  The  overall  targets  for  the  city\u2019s  development  are  for  Kunming  to  become  a  National  Garden  City,  a  Model  City  for \n\nEnvironmental Protection, a National Sanitary City, and a Green Kunming. \n\n\f5 \n\nsignificantly  to  water  and  wastewater  tariff  reforms  and  resources  conservation. 7  The  tariff \nguidelines  include  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  will  allow  full  cost  recovery,  taking  into \nconsideration affordability and social constraints. Further, ADB provided TA support to strengthen \npolicy reform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance PSP in public utilities, and a TA \nto  support  the  water  utilities  in  Nanjing  to  develop  sustainable  access  to  the  private  long-term \ncapital finance market sector.8  \n \n18. \nKunming  is  very  advanced  in  incentive  and  regulatory  structures  related  to  tariffs.  The \npresent  tariff  setting  mechanism  adheres  to  full  cost  recovery,  and  provides  a  subsidized  lifeline \ntariff  to  the  poor  up  to  6  m3/month  and  raw  water  fee  made  up  of  a  water  resource  fee  of \nCNY0.23/m3  and  a  water  management  fee  of  CNY0.20/m3.  The  raw  water  fee  is  levied  on  water \nsupplied to the water treatment plant. The water resource fee is used to support compensation to \naffected  persons  (APs)  in  the  watershed,  where  adopting  environment-friendly  farming  practices \nwould  lead  to  loss  of  income.  The  water  management  fee  of  CNY0.20/m3  is  transferred  to  the \nreservoir  operator  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  water  quality  monitoring,  and \nsedimentation  control  measures  to  ensure  sustainability.  The  Project  will  support  KMG\u2019s  timely \nimplementation of required tariff increases based on the sector\u2019s real cost requirements. \n \n19. \nKMG  has  taken  significant  steps  towards  PSP  through  a  joint  venture  (JV)  agreement \nbetween its subsidiary, Kunming CGE Water Supply Company (with 51% equity), and Veolia (49%) \nequity.  The  key  objective  is  to  improve  operational  efficiency  and  service  provision  in \n(i) maintaining  drinking  water  quality  to  national  standards  through  introduction  of  new  water \ntreatment  technology;  (ii)  improving  technical  and  operational  efficiency  by  reducing  non-revenue \nwater, metering, increasing connections, and a leakage reduction program; (iii) improved customer \nservice focus; and (iv) improved managerial capacity in financial management, business planning, \nand  management  information  system  development.  The  Project  will  support  KMG  to  provide  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  JV,  including  tariff  reforms  and  regulation,  ensuring  timely \nimplementation  of  required  tariff  increases  based  on  meeting  efficiency  targets  and  service \nstandards,  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  \u201cone  household,  one  meter\u201d  policy  to  promote  water \nconservation and effectively reduce system losses. In addition, groundwater licensing and use will \nbe phased out in Kunming by 2012, once Qingshuihai water becomes available.  \n \nThe  management  of  water  resources  and  catchment  protection  in  Kunming  is  currently \n20. \ngoverned by regulations on pollution control in and around the reservoirs. KMG undertakes multi-\nlevel  and  cross-sectoral  consultations,  detailed  surveys,  and  consensus-building  prior  to  drafting \nwater protection regulations specific to each reservoir. Policy dialogue on developing a watershed \nmanagement  plan  has  been  initiated  during  project  preparation  and  it  was  agreed  that  the \nGovernment will inform ADB on the progress of developing and implementing the plan. To ensure \na more rational allocation and sustainable development of water resources, KMG will explore the \nscope for overall water management administration\u2014integrating water resources, urban and rural \nwater  supply,  water  usage,  wastewater  management,  and  water  conservation  programs,  and \ninstitutional  arrangements  between  and  among  the  municipal  and  county  level  agencies.  The \npolicy dialogue is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  1997.

External  assistance  to  KMG  in  developing  and  implementing  its \nwater  supply  and  environmental  infrastructure  has  come  mainly  from  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC. \nThe  Project  will  be  the first  ADB-financed  project  in  Kunming.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  provided  23 \nloans  to  the  PRC,  totalling  $2.639  billion  for  urban  development  and  environment  projects.  ADB \nhas  also  provided  about  $44.1  million  for  more  than  67  TAs  to  prepare  projects\u2014to  review  and \nstudy  key  issues  in  water  resources  management,  urban  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment, \npollution control, and urban transport. The external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n22. \nLessons.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  water  sector  were  considered  in  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government,  engineering  design  of  the  project  facilities,  and  capacity \ndevelopment  programs.  Lessons  from  previous  projects  in  Kunming  city  and  Yunnan  Province \nwere  also  considered.  One  of  the  most  important  lessons  is  the  need  for  integration  of  strategic \nmaster plans with the overall cross-sectoral issues on water, urban, and environment rather than \nas  stand-alone  distinct  documents.  Since  the  Project  covers  water  supply,  extensive  policy \ndialogue is needed with the Government on linking the water supply master plan with the Kunming \ncity  master  plan  with  its  infrastructure  plans  on  water  resource  protection  and  management, \nwastewater, and the master plans on the new development zones. The Project conforms with the \nabove master plans. A second lesson is the importance of cost recovery and tariff reform. These \nwere  discussed  as  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  and  it  was  agreed  that  the  review  of  tariffs  should \ninclude  operational  efficiency \nto  water  resource  protection  and \nmanagement,  discourage  groundwater  use,  and  promote  water  conservation  and  reuse.  KMG\u2019s \nexisting tariff setting has established a cost recovery mechanism in ensuring proper protection and \nmanagement  of  existing  and  future  water  resources. 9  A  third  lesson  is  that  increased  public \nawareness is one of the most effective measures to improve the sector\u2019s performance and urban \nenvironment. In view of this, KMG will embark on a comprehensive multimedia public awareness \ncampaign  on  water  metering,  conservation,  reuse,  and  effective  environment  protection  and \nmanagement. Further support is needed to ensure strict enforcement of metering to reduce water \nlosses by users. A lesson related to resettlement is the need for the establishment of an effective \ninternal  and  external  monitoring  mechanism  of  resettlement  implementation  by  resettlement \nagencies. Municipal and county-level arrangements for monitoring and evaluation have been fully \nincorporated in the resettlement plans (RPs). \n \nA recent review of the water supply, sanitation, and waste management sector undertaken \n23. \nin the PRC, identified success and deficiencies, and lessons from portfolio performance.10 Among \nthe  major  issues  identified  were  delays  in  the  startup  of  projects  and  in  procurement,  and  weak \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and  sustainable  operations.  These  issues \nhave been reviewed in detail during project preparation and the lessons have been incorporated in \nthe project design. Implementation arrangements have been strengthened within KMG, the project \nmanagement office (PMO), and the Implementing Agency (KWSG). Clear roles and responsibilities \nand  effective  coordination  between  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  level  governments  are  in \nplace to ensure smooth domestic processing, approval, and project implementation. \n \n\ninclude  support \n\ntargets, \n\n                                                 \n9   Part  of  the  tariff  is  the  raw  water  fee  (currently  CNY0.43/m3).  Part  of  this  fee  (CNY0.20/m3)  is  allocated  for  water \nresource protection, which is used in compensating the local farmers on shifting to organic farming and environment-\nfriendly  farming  practices.  Municipal,  county,  and  village  programs  are  coordinated  mainly  between  the  Agriculture, \nForestry, and Water Resources Bureaus. Historically, any shortfall in funding has been provided by Kunming Finance \nBureau and YPG. \n\n10  ADB.  2005.

Manila (Final Report, July). \n\n\f7 \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n24. \nThe impact of the Project is improved urban environment, public health, and quality of life \nfor  urban  residents  of  Kunming;  and  sustained  economic  development  of  the  city,  through  the \nprovision  of  safe  and  reliable  water  supply.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  the  provision  of  more \nefficient,  reliable,  affordable,  safe,  and  clean  raw  water  supply;  and  effective  protection  and \nmanagement of water resources in Kunming (contributing to the achievement of MDG 7, target 10). \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  consists  of  three  components,  broken  down  into  12  subcomponents  and \n40 activities,  which  provide  fundamental  support  to  Kunming\u2019s  11th  FYP  and  beyond.  The  three \ncomponents are (i) water resources development, (ii) water conveyance systems, and (iii) capacity \ndevelopment and project management. Details are in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n26.  Water  Resources  Development.  This  component  will  (i)  increase  water  inflow  to  and \nperennial  storage  in  the  existing  natural  Qingshuihai  water  storage  and  distribution  facilities \n(34 km2) and (ii) construct Qingshuihai and Jinzhongshan reservoirs.  Transit dams and reservoirs \nwill  be  constructed  to  store  water  in  Qingshuihai  reservoir  from  the  four  surrounding  catchments \ntemporarily  (Banqiaohe,  Shiqiaohe,  Xintianhe,  and  Tabizi  Longtan  Springs).  From  Qingshuihai, \nwater will be transferred as a steady flow to Jinzhongshan reservoir. With the Project, the quality of \nraw  water  will  be  maintained  at  class  II  and  will  serve  about  30%  of  domestic  water  and  other \nnonindustrial demands in Kunming in 2012; a sustained level of 24-hour water service and quality, \nand  prevention  of  subsequent  shortages  in  Kunming  urban  area  as  demand  increases;  and \nimproved overall public satisfaction with water supply services. \n \n27.  Water  Conveyance  Systems.  This  component  will  take  water  from  Qingshuihai  under \ngravity which is energy efficient, to NADZ and Kunming through Jinzhongshan water storage and \ndistribution facilities, and to the EDZ through Songhuaba reservoir. The conveyance works  which \nis about 72.8 kms comprise: (i) 12.5 km of tunnel and other structures between Shiqiaohe reservoir \nto  Qingshuihai;  (ii)  4.0  km  of  tunnel  and  other  structures  between  Banqiaohe  reservoir  to \nQingshuihai; (iii) 50.78 km of tunnel and other structures from Qingshuihai to Jinzhongshan, with \n43.1 km to Tongxin Gate (where the flow can be divided or directed to either Jinzhongshan and/or \nSonghuaba  reservoirs)  and  6.9  km  from  Tongxin  Gate  to  Jinzhongshan;  and  (iv)  rehabilitation  of \n5.7 km of channel from Tabizi Longtan to Qingshuihai.  \n \n28. \nCapacity  Development  and  Project  Management.  This  component  will  ensure  that  the \nPMO, KWSG, and other stakeholders are able to implement the Project effectively and manage the \nproject  facilities.  This  component  will  include  project  management  consulting  services,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  various  trainings  during  Project  implementation.  Capacity  development  will \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  to  ensure  proper  and  sustainable \noperation,  management,  and  maintenance  of  the  water  storage  facilities  and  conveyance  works. \nFurther,  focus  is  on  enhanced  operational  efficiency  and  financial  sustainability  and  compliance \nwith  all  relevant  national  policies  for  cost  recovery  and  enterprise  reforms  of  the  water  supply \nsector, and linking with different agencies and institutions on proper water resource protection and \nenvironmental management. The component will include (i) project management and construction \nsupervision;  (ii)  improvement  of  financial  management  and  setup  of  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS);  (iii)  safeguards  management  and  monitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and \nbusiness planning; (v) tariff review; (vi) dam and reservoir management, operation, and safety; (vii) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nonline  water  quality  monitoring;  and  (viii)  development  of  public  awareness  training  on  water \ndemand measures and social impact monitoring.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nloans. 11  The \n\ntariff  structure  allows \n\nThe  Project  is  the  first  ADB-financed  project  in  Kunming,  and  aims  to  support  ongoing \n29. \nintegration  of  water  sector  management  policy  and  strategic  reforms  to  ensure  Kunming\u2019s  long-\nterm sustainable growth. The Project builds on and advances ADB policy dialogue and initiatives \nwith the Government in several key areas, including: (i) cost recovery and tariff reform, (ii) pro-poor \nfeatures,  (iii)  corporate  governance  reform,  and  (iv)  PSP.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to \ncontinue supporting KMG in creating an enabling environment to ensure the success of its current \npublic-private  partnership  through  tariff  reform,  strict  enforcement  of  groundwater  use  restriction, \nenforcement of metering, and improved corporate governance.  \n \n30. \nCost  Recovery  and  Tariff  Reform.  The  current  tariff  structure  is  well  established  and \nprovides  a  strong  foundation  for  project  sustainability.  It  includes  mechanisms  to  (i)  ensure \nfinancial sustainability and full cost recovery; (ii) provide the poor with  access to water through a \nlifeline block tariff; (iii) promote economic efficiency by adopting a progressive tariff structure; and \n(iv) meet the social objective of affordability, with households meeting their basic water needs at an \naffordable price. Tariffs meet the full cost recovery of O&M cost plus depreciation of water supply \noperations  (treatment  and  distribution)  and  related  water  resources  development,  reservoir \nmanagement, water source protection, reasonable return to the JV operator, and provision for debt \nservice  of  all  water  supply  sector \ntransparent  and \nadministratively  efficient  charging  where  the  amount  charged  to  each  type  of  customer  is  easily \ncalculated  and  billed.  Any  application  for  tariff  increase  by  KWSG  is  reviewed  by  KMG  and \napproved by YPG, and is based on reasonable grounds of increase in costs and meeting efficiency \nstandards.  The  financial  sustainability  of  water  resource  investments  is  assured  through  water \nresource  and  water  management  fees  which  cover  the  costs  of  reservoir  operations  and \nmanagement and catchment protection; and channeling to reservoir operators is transparent and \nefficient.  The  Project  will  support  further  tariff  reform  by  (i)  assisting  KWSG  to  undertake  annual \nreviews  of  tariffs  to  ensure  full  recovery  of  O&M  cost;  (ii)  policy  dialogue  with  KMG,  to  move \ngradually towards equalization of nondomestic tariffs for industries and commercial users earliest \nby 2012 to promote water conservation and efficiency; and (iii) monitoring timely tariff increases.  \n \n31. \nPro-Poor  Features.  The  Project  will  benefit  approximately  3.4  million  people,  of  whom \n6.9%  are  classified  poor.  It  incorporates  several  features  to  ensure  that  the  poor,  women,  and \nvulnerable groups benefit from investments under the Project, including (i) a strong focus on health \nimpacts,  which  are  expected  to  benefit  women  and  children  disproportionately;  (ii)  support  for \ncontinued  provision  of  price  subsidies  and  lifeline  tariffs  to  contribute  to  cushioning  the  impact  of \ntariff  increases  on  the  poor;  and  (iii)  support  for  KMG\u2019s  cross-sectoral  water  source  protection \nprograms to ensure that communities take ownership of environmental protection. \n \n32. \nCorporate Governance Reform.  The Project will support corporate governance reform of \nKWSG  through:  (i)  introduction  of  a  water  users\u2019  representative  on  KWSG\u2019s  board  of  directors\u2014\nproviding  a  greater  understanding  of  water  supply  and  distribution  issues  in  the  community, \nensuring  improved  accountability,  improved  services,  and  stakeholders\u2019  welfare;  (ii)  further \nimprovement  in  the  billing  and  collection  and  reduction  in  accounts  receivables  through  full \nmetering  of  households;  (iii)  improving  the  managerial  capacity  of  KWSG  in  dam  and  reservoir \nmanagement,  operation,  and  safety;  and  online  water  quality  monitoring,  which  is  a  new \n\n                                                 \n11 These include World Bank and JBIC loans for water treatment plants, Zhangjuhe reservoir, and water treatment plant \n\nno. 7. \n\n\f9 \n\nundertaking for the company; and (iv) enhancing the capacity of KWSG in corporate and business \nplanning  functions  to  coordinate  closely  with  the  JV  in  investment  planning  and  system \nimprovements. There is an assurance for undertaking corporate governance reforms, and this will \nbe  supported  through  consulting  services  during  project  implementation.  Further,  UN-Habitat  will \nprovide grant financing to assist KMG in capacity building to (i) implement water conservation and \ndemand  management  measures,  including  tariff  review;  (ii)  develop  community-based  water  and \nsanitation  services  in  poorer  areas  in  Songhuaba  reservoir;  and  (iii)  develop  human  value  based \nsanitation and hygiene education among water users in Kunming.12  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  KWSG has an operating PSP arrangement in the form of a \n33. \nJV between a KWSG subsidiary and Veolia (para. 19) to ensure the efficient provision of safe and \nsecure  water  supply  to  the  growing  urban  population  of  Kunming.  The  Project  will  support  the \nenabling environment for the successful operation of the JV through (i) continued tariff reform and \nregulation,  (ii)  ensuring  that  tariff  increases  are  based  on  meeting  efficiency  targets  and  service \nstandards, and (iii) the enforcement of the \u201cone household, one meter\u201d policy. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n34. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $255.94 million equivalent, including taxes and duties. \nTable  1  provides  a  summary  of  the  project  investment  plan,  and  details  are  in  Appendix  5  and \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nTotal Costa \n\nItem \nA.

The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance civil works, \nequipment,  and  consulting  services.  Provincial  and  municipal  governments  will  provide  equity \nequivalent to $76.8 million or 30% of the total project cost. The balance of $99.1 million, or 38.7%, \nwill  be  provided  by  a  domestic  loan  from  the  Agricultural  Bank  of  China.  The  loan  will  carry  an \ninterest rate of 6.5%, a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Both the municipal \ngovernment  and  the  Agricultural  Bank  of  China  have  provided  commitment  letters  confirming  the \navailability of the domestic loans and equity funding. The equity injection by KMG would represent \nabout 0.4% of annual expenditure over 2008 to 2012 (Appendix 12, para. 14).  \n \n36. \nThe ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources. The loan will carry an interest \nrate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  for \nUS dollar loans, an annual commitment charge of 0.35%, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 5. \nDisbursements  for  eligible  expenditures  will  be  made  based  on  different  ratios  specified  for  each \ncost category. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nA.

The Government will relend the loan proceeds to YPG, which \nwill onlend the loan proceeds to KMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \nThe loan proceeds will then be onlent to KWSG on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB  loan.  KWSG  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB \nloan. The flow of funds and onlending arrangements are in Appendix 6. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n38. \nKMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project leading group (PLG) will be \nresponsible  for  project  coordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during  implementation. \nHeaded  by  the  vice  mayor,  the  PLG  will  comprise  representatives  of  the  Kunming  Financial \nBureau, Kunming Development Reform Commission, related agencies, and county governments.13 \nThe PLG will meet as required and will be maintained until project completion. \n \n                                                 \n13 Related agencies include the Construction, Environment Protection, Land and Resources, Planning, Public Utility, and \nResettlement  Bureaus,  NADZ  Management  Commission,  Forest  Administration  Bureau,  Lake  Dianchi  Investment \nCompany, and Kunming  Drainage Company. County  governments are  Songming and Xundian County, and Guandu \ndistrict. \n\n\f11 \n\n39. \nThe PMO has been established within Kunming Development and Reform Commission. It \nwill serve as the secretariat of the PLG and will be responsible for coordinating the implementation \nof  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure  adequate  interdepartmental  cooperation  and \ninteragency  coordination,  (ii)  monitor  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate \ncommunication  and  interaction  among  ADB,  KWSG  and  agencies  concerned.  The  IA  is  KWSG, \nwhich  is  a limited  liability  company  incorporated  under  the PRC  company  law,  2004.  The  KWSG \nwill  be  responsible  for  operating  and  managing  project  facilities,  direct  day-to-day  Project \nmanagement,  construction  supervision,  preparing  progress  reports  to  the  PMO  for  submission  to \nADB,  and  planning  strategic  direction  of  water supply  and management  services  and  operations. \nKWSG  is  well  organized,  with  experience  implementing  World  Bank  and  JBIC  loan  projects.  A \nproject implementation unit has been established in the KWSG and is responsible for undertaking \ndetailed implementation activities. The project organization is in Appendix 7. The internal controls \nand accounting and auditing procedures of KWSG were reviewed through a financial management \nassessment; these are generally in order and will be fully functional and available for use for the \nconstruction  and  operational  phase  of  the  Project.  The  financial  management  assessment  is \nsummarized  in  Appendix  12  and  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L.  An  assessment  was \nundertaken  of  KWSG\u2019s  technical  and  institutional  capacities,  which  are  adequate  for  project \nimplementation.  KWSG  will  retain  the  services  of  design  institutes,  procurement  agencies,  and \nconstruction supervision companies to assist in implementation activities. The PMO and KWSG will \nhave  a  number  of  their staff  trained  in  project management  and  relevant  ADB  procedures  during \nproject implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  2008  to  2012  (Appendix  8). 14 This \n40. \nschedule is considered realistic and achievable, because the project implementation structure and \narrangements  are  already  in  place  and  preparatory  works  are  under  way.  The  detailed \nimplementation plan is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41.  Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts \nfor works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than \nthe ICB values, but more than $100,000, will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) \nprocedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured using shopping procedures.15 The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nProvision  has  been  made  for  about  18  person-months  of  international  and  72  person-\nmonths of national consulting services to be funded under the Project to support the PMO and IA in \nproject implementation and capacity development. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nconsulting  firm  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nusing  full  technical  proposal  procedures.  A  fixed  quality  cost  ratio  of  80:20  will  be  applied.  The \nconsulting  services  will  cover  (i)  project  management  and  construction  supervision;  (ii) \n                                                 \n14  Preparatory works such as detailed designs, land acquisition, and resettlement are scheduled in late 2007. \n15 ADB  will  require  KMG  to  use  ADB-approved  standard  bidding  documents  (to  be  developed  as  necessary)  to  ensure \n\nhigh quality and consistency of the documents to facilitate ADB review.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  setup  of  PPMS;  (iii)  safeguards  management  and \nmonitoring;  (iv)  corporate  and  business  planning;  (v)  tariff  review;  (vi)  dam  and  reservoir \nmanagement, operation, and safety; (vii) online water quality monitoring; and (viii) development of \npublic awareness training on water demand measures and social impact monitoring. The PMO will \ninitiate  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  including  short-listing  of  qualified \nconsultants. Detailed institutional analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F, and the outline terms \nof reference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n43. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  approve  advance \ncontracting, which includes recruitment of consultants and procurement of goods and civil works; \nand the request for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for civil works and equipment for \nsite  preparation  and  construction  up  to  $8  million  (equivalent  to  10%  of  the  ADB  loan)  to  be \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than a maximum of 12 months before signing of \nthe  Loan  Agreement. 16  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i) prequalification  of  contractors, \ntendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works  contract  packages;  (ii)  preparation  of  tender \ndocuments  for  the  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment;  (iii)  award  of  contracts;  and  (iv) \nrecruitment  of  consultants.  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance  procurement  action \nwill be subject to ADB approval. All advance procurement actions will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB \nto finance the Project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  funds \nflow,  an  imprest  account  will  be  set  up  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  will  be  exclusively  used  to \nfinance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  initial  advance  to  be  deposited  to  an  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  direct  payment  procedures  will  apply  for  the  large  work  contracts.  If  the \nGovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the  reimbursement \nprocedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation  process,  the \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  imprest \naccount  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual \npayment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  ceiling  will  be \nreimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  full  supporting  documentation  process. 17  The \nimprest account will be opened and managed by Yunnan Provincial Finance Bureau on behalf of \nYPG at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n45. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period  under  review,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected  in  the  next  half  year.  The  IA  will  keep \nrecords  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  and  follow  accounting \nprinciples  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC,  2000.  The  law  requires \n                                                 \n16  The advance action for the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \n\nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. \n\n17 In line with adequate financial capability of the Executing Agency/IA based on the financial management assessment, \n\nthe ceiling of the statement of expenditures is identified at a higher level to facilitate disbursement. \n\n\f13 \n\nfollow \n\nto  prepare \n\nfinancial  statements  and  generally \n\nenterprises \ninternationally  accepted \naccounting  standards.  The  IA  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  financial \nstatements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for the IA will be \nsubject  to  audit  by  KMG  Audit  Bureau,  Yunnan  Provincial  Audit  Bureau,  and  State  Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council and will meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures procedure will be part of the audit reports. The \nIA\u2019s annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no \nlater than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the entire implementation period.18 YPG and \nKMG  were  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  requiring  the  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  on \ntime.  YPG,  KMG,  and  the  IA  will  submit  audited  financial  statements  and  reports  to  ADB \nconcerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  IA  performance.  These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than 6 months after completion of the Project.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  PPMS  indicators  include  (i)  quantity  of  clean  water  provided,  (ii)  improvements  in \n46. \nmanagement  arrangements  for  project  facilities,  (iii)  adoption  of  least-cost  project  designs, \n(iv) enforcement  of  environmental  regulations,  (v)  strengthening  of  water  sector  governance,  and \n(vi)  improved  management  capacity  for  water  supply.  The  relevance  and  practicability  of  data \ncollection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO. \n \n47. \nAt the start of project implementation, the PMO and IA, with the assistance of consultants, \nwill  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures to  generate data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and \noutputs  of  the  project  components,  as  well  as  the  agreed  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and \nhealth  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  project  impacts.  A  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  the \nfuture performance of the project facilities will be designed by the loan implementation consultants \nbefore  the  start  of  operations.  The  PMO  and  IA  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  confirm \nachievable targets, (iii) firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems \nand procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. \n \nUnder  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  progress  data  will  be  reported  at  the  required \n48. \ntime  intervals  by  the  IA,  including  semiannual  reporting  of  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  its \nmanagement  information  system  that  will  be  established  at  the  time  of  loan  implementation.  The \nPPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  for  project  design, \nschedule,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants, \nwill  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  report  to  ADB  on  a  semiannual  basis  on  the  physical \nimplementation and financial aspects of the Project from start of project implementation to 2 years \nafter  project  completion  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \n\n9. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n49. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government,  KMG  and  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \n\n                                                 \n18 The  IA  now  has  three  tiers  of  audit:  (i)  internal  audit,  (ii)  municipal  government  audit,  and  (iii)  provincial  and  state \n\ngovernment audit. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan \ncovenants  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  KMG,  IA,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, KMG and IA will undertake the \nfollowing  anticorruption  actions:  (i)  involve  full-time  officials  from  assigned  relevant  bureaus  to \ninvestigate  corrupt  practices  in  bidding  and  construction  to  enhance  construction  quality  control \nand supervise effective work; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract \nwinner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  (iii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv)  engage  the  project \nmanagement  consultant  to  support  the  PMO  and  IA  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability, \nand  transparency  in  project  operations;  and  (v)  in  consultation  with  relevant  central  government \nministries, update rules and regulations on local and corporate governance and anticorruption, and \nenhance the transparency of IA operations. Specific governance actions will be undertaken related \nto financial control and management, performance audits, public disclosure of financial statements, \nand any proposed tariff increases on the project website.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n50. \nADB, the Government, YPG, KMG and IA will review project implementation jointly at least \nonce a year and will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of project \nimplementation.  This  review  will  include  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and  progress  on  the  agenda  for \npolicy  reform  and  capacity  development  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n51. \nThe Project will directly benefit about 3.4 million people living in the project areas, of whom \nabout 6.9% are poor. All residents of Kunming will benefit indirectly, as their living conditions will \nimprove as a result of (i) improved water quality and quantity; (ii) improved security of water supply, \nwhich  will  mean  less  likelihood  of  rationing  in  drought  years;  (iii)  reduced  use  of  polluted  water \nsources;  and  (iv)  reduced  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  the  associated  reduction  in \nmedical  costs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  lead  to  employment  creation  during  construction  and \noperation of project facilities. Health benefits are expected to be felt disproportionately by women \nand children. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n52. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. Land acquisition and house demolition will impact on \nlocal  residents  at  the  reservoir  inundation  areas,  and  where  infrastructure  will  have  to  be \nconstructed\u2014mainly  the  dam  and  diversion  complex,  water  conveyance  routes,  and  permanent \naccess  roads.  In  total,  about  5,571.2  mu  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  for  the  Project, \nincluding  2,619.4  mu  of  farmland  and  2,214.0  mu  of  woodland.  Some  structures  will  have  to  be \ndemolished,  including  56,633.9  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses  and  7,080.93  m2  of \nnonresidential  buildings.  In  total,  177  households  (702  APs)  will  be  permanently  affected  by  land \nacquisition  and  492  households  (2,093  APs)  will  be  affected  by  house  demolition.  In  addition, \n2,114.3 mu of land will be occupied temporarily, including 627.0 mu of farmland and 1,260.2 mu of \nwoodland.  Based  on  recent  estimates,  temporary  land  acquisition  will  affect  103  households \n(385 APs). All households affected by land acquisition and house demolition will be compensated \n\n\f15 \n\nat replacement costs for their assets and will receive other allowances for relocation and income \nrestoration.  Households  suffering  from  house  demolition  will  be  relocated  within  their  existing \nvillages.  Land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  all  associated  costs  are  estimated  at \nCNY185.68 million, which is equivalent to 10.2% of the total project costs. The summary RP is in \nAppendix  10.  KMG  has  complied  with  the  ADB  full  disclosure  policy  for  resettlement  activities. \nKWSG  will  construct  and  upgrade  water  and  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  and  lay  the \nwater distribution networks, which would entail land acquisition and resettlement impacts.19 An RP \nwill  be  prepared  for  these  facilities  based  on  the  agreed  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary \nAppendix H) during implementation of the Project.  \n \n53. \nADB  requires  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  APs  during  implementation.  The \nPMO will retain the services of a national external monitor for this purpose. The external monitor \nwill  visit  the  subcomponents  every  6  months  to  (i)  review  resettlement  progress  and  the  general \nwelfare  of  those  affected,  (ii)  make  recommendations  to  resolve  any  issues  or  problems,  (iii) \nprovide advice to the IA and local officials, (iv) evaluate the results through annual survey updates \nfor  2  years  after  completion  of  resettlement,  and  (v)  prepare  a  summary  of  the  final  resettlement \naudit  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  to  ADB.  The  external  monitor  will  pay  special  attention  to \nvulnerable groups, including women and the poor, to assess whether they have fully regained their \nstandard  of  living.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during \nimplementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be \nsubmitted simultaneously to ADB, PMO, and IA. These will also be uploaded to the ADB website. \n \n54. \nPoverty  Reduction,  Health,  and  Social  Benefits. The Project supports the achievement \nof the MDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people \nwithout  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (Target  10).  The \nProject will directly benefit 3.4 million people, 6.9% of whom are classified poor, by ensuring that \nthe expanding urban population of Kunming continues to have access to safe water. The Project \nwill support a tariff structure that includes price subsidies and a lifeline tariff to cushion the impact \nof tariff increases on the poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n11, and the full poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  for  approximately  4,200  people  on  construction  work \neach year for 5 years, and an additional 10,920 people will be employed annually in jobs created \nindirectly as a result of construction. It is estimated that at least 50% of the construction jobs will be \nunskilled, and the poor should benefit disproportionately from this job creation. Project construction \nalone will generate approximately CNY236.25 million in wages per year. The Project will contribute \nto  the  prevention  of  up  to  an  estimated  1.5  million  cases  of  waterborne  diseases  from  2013  to \n2020,  and  the  associated  increase  in  median  medical  costs  is  projected  to  be  likely  to  rise  from \nCNY18  to  CNY30  per  capita  (at  current  values)  by  2020.  Health  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt \ndisproportionately by women since they are more at risk of waterborne diseases, and by children \nwho  have  least  resistance  to  such  diseases.  The  health  impact  assessment  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n56. \nStakeholder  Consultation.  During  project  preparation,  local  government  and  line \nagencies, villagers, enterprises, local groups, and other people likely to be directly affected by the \nProject  were  consulted.  These  consultations  covered  project  scope, \ntechnical  design, \nenvironmental  concerns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  ethnic  minority  issues,  and \neconomic development potentials. The project team conducted household interviews, focus group \ndiscussions,  village  leader  interviews,  and  key  informant  interviews  to  assess  potential  project \n\n                                                 \n19 Associated facilities include the water treatment plants and distribution networks and the WWTPs in NADZ, EDZ, and \n\nin Xundian County. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nbenefits and adverse impacts, and generate comments and suggestions in formulating mitigation \nmeasures. Over 1,300 people were interviewed during project preparation. To ensure equal benefit \nfrom  the  Project,  separate  consultations  were  conducted  with  the  poor,  women,  minority  groups, \nand  other  vulnerable  groups.  For  the  assessments  on  environment,  resettlement,  and  ethnic \nminorities,  consultations  were  held  with  representatives  of  affected  counties,  townships,  and \nvillages.  Both  rural  and urban  people  were  familiar  with  the  Project  and  public support  was  high. \nThe  consultations  were  taken  into  consideration  in  the  project  design  and  the  formulation  of  the \nEMP, RP, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), and watershed management strategy. \n \nEthnic  Minorities.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  indicates  that  there  are  a  number  of \n57. \nethnic  minority  groups  in  the  project  areas.  In  the  rural  project-affected  areas,  where  there  is  a \nsignificant  ethnic  minority  population,  ethnic  people  live  intermixed  with  the  majority  Han  people, \nand the project impacts that they will experience will be the same. The Project poses no threat to \ntraditional land rights or cultural or communal integrity. It will seek to maximize the benefits for all \npoor  and  vulnerable  households  regardless  of  ethnicity.  It  is  important  that  (i)  ethnic  minority \npeople are able to benefit equally from the Project; (ii) any negative impacts that might affect them, \nalongside  the  Han  majority,  are  mitigated;  and  (iii)  they  participate  in  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring. The detailed EMDP is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n58. \nA financial impact analysis of the Project and a financial management assessment of the IA \nhave  been  undertaken.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  was  computed  on  an \nafter-tax  basis  of  5.7%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  after-tax  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital in real terms of 3.7%, demonstrating the financial sustainability of the Project. The result is \nrobust  to  a range  of  sensitivity  analyses.  The  average  incremental  financial  cost  of  treated  water \n(CNY2.74/m3) compared with the average tariff (CNY3.33/m3) demonstrates that water users as a \ngroup  are  paying  in  excess  of  the  average  incremental  financial  cost  by  CNY0.59/m3  (excluding \ntaxes),  so  that  the  cost  of  the  water  distribution  operations  and  water  source  reservoir \nmanagement are being fully recovered. The affordability analysis demonstrates that a low-income \nhousehold would pay only 1.7% of household income in 2007 (for 60 liters per capita per day) and \nan  average  income  household  1.1%  (for  100  liters  per  capita  per  day).  Even  where  wastewater \ntariffs  were  increased  to  full  cost  recovery  levels  (about  CNY2.00/m3  by  2016)  a  low-income \nhousehold would pay only 2.3% of income and an average income household 1.2% of household \nincome for both their water and wastewater requirements. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12, \nthe  tariff  and  affordability  analysis  is  in  Appendix  13,  and  the  detailed  financial  analysis  and \nfinancial management assessment is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n59. \nThe  historical  financial  performance  of  KWSG  water  operations  indicates  that  it  has  been \nable to operate without any subsidies and within the tariff structure. However, because of lack of \ninvestment,  water  losses  have  risen  from  24%  to  40%.  The  JV  will  address  water  losses  in \nKunming and the introduction of full metering to customers, while KWSG will be responsible for the \ndevelopment of new distribution systems in the EDZ and NADZ.  \n \nOverall revenues of KWSG will increase from a forecasted CNY784 million in 2007 (the first \n60. \nfull  year  of  JV  operations)  to  CNY2,270  million  in  2020\u2014mainly  as  a  result  of  KWSG\u2019s  share  of \nincreased water sales, which account for 54% of revenues in 2020. In addition, KWSG will receive \nfunds from the tariff for loan repayment and water management fees to cover reservoir operations, \nas well as lease payments from the JV for use of water treatment plant no. 7. KWSG\u2019s net profit \nafter tax is projected to increase from CNY25 million in 2007 to CNY439 million in 2020. The debt \nservice ratio is adequate in all years, with cash available for debt service exceeding 1.6 times debt \nservice. With the inclusion of Zhangjiuhe in KWSG\u2019s balance sheet from 2007, the debt-equity ratio \n\n\f17 \n\nincreases to 46% from 7% in 2006; with Qingshuihai assets and funding, it remains at 46% in 2009 \nbefore decreasing over the remainder of the forecast period to 22% by 2020. \n \n61. \nKWSG  financial  management  procedures  and  capacity  are  adequate  to  undertake  the \nProject.  KWSG  has  had  experience  in  preparing  and  implementing  three  JBIC  and  World  Bank \nfunded  projects  between  1991  and  2007.  Its  extensive  experience  and  demonstrated  project \nimplementation  capacity  should  facilitate  smooth  and  successful  implementation  of  the  Project. \nTraining  will  be  provided  on  ADB  loan  processing  policies  and  capacity  development,  including \nreservoir management and long-term corporate and financial planning. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n62. \nThe  economic  analysis  provides  the  rationale  and  justification  for  the  Project  based  on \npolicy,  sector,  and  local  area  analysis.  The  economic  rationale  is  sound,  based  on  addressing \nKunming  water  supply  requirements  with  sufficient  quantity  and  class  II  water  quality.  This  will \nimprove both the water security and water quality, and it will no longer be necessary for Kunming \nto rely on polluted sources. This will improve overall living conditions, especially for the poor. The \nwater  quality  targets  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and  consistent  with  international \npractice.  The  plan  to  meet  water  quality  targets  uses  low-cost  gravity-fed  raw  water  bulk  supply \nfrom  Qingshuihai  Lake,  and  is  demonstrated  to  be  both  the  best  technical  and  least-cost  option. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  20.1%,  which  is  above  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  result  is  robust  to  a  range  of  sensitivity  analyses.  A \nsummary economic analysis is in Appendix 14 and details are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n63. \nExtensive  public  consultation\u2014involving  surveys,  meetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus \ngroup  discussions\u2014was  undertaken  during  preparation  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA). The EIA is based on the national laws, regulations, and standards applicable in PRC.20 The \nproject  approach  to  water  resources  use,  environmental  protection,  and  project  infrastructure \nmanagement  was  thoroughly  discussed  and  technical  studies  were  undertaken  during  EIA \npreparation to meet the stringent government approval process. These include (i) comprehensive \ntechnical analysis for the Water Use Certificate related to all project water users and the provision \nof  environmental  flows,  and  (ii)  water  source  environmental  management  planning.  It  was  also \nconfirmed  that  the  Project  will  abide  by  the  national  guidelines  for  protection  of  water  sources  in \naccordance  with \nissued  by  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration. \n \n64. \nThe overall strategy and action plan for water sector activities within Kunming Municipality \nwere  discussed  with  KMG  and  it  was  agreed  that  environmental  issues  related  to  the  Project  be \nconfined  to  (i)  Qingshuihai  watershed  area,  (ii)  source  river  areas  downstream  of  the  project \nreservoirs that may be impacted during operations, (iii) project associated facilities, and (iv) issues \narising for treatment of wastewater generated as a result of the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  relieve  the  water  supply  pressure  in  Kunming  city,  (ii)  save  water  by \n65. \nreplacing  inefficient  groundwater  wells,  (iii)  have  positive  effects  on  economic  development  of \n\ntechnical  specifications \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n20 Yunnan Environment Protection Bureau will approve the EIA, including the Strategic Environmental Planning Proposal. \nIt is anticipated that Yunnan Environment Protection Bureau, following due review,  will approve the EIA in mid-June. \nThe TA consultant has reviewed the EIA against criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines and \nthe  PRC\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Guidelines  (SEPA  1993).  Overall,  the  application  methods  and \nstandards for preparation of an EIA have been observed, and are assessed as compliant  with the above guidelines, \nand are in agreement with all existing national and local laws and regulations. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nKunming,  (iv)  improve  health  status  by  supplying  clean  water,  (v)  provide  temporary  and \npermanent jobs during the construction and operation period, and (vi) benefit the ethnic minority. It \nalso concludes that various existing and potential water users have been considered and will not \nbe affected significantly. The ecological impacts on Jinshajiang and Xiaojiang rivers will be minimal \nsince  the  proportion  of  water  transferred  from  the  Xiaojiang  will  be  well  below  the  globally \nestablished Water Resource Development Indicator for river basins in the Project, at 11.78% of the \nXiaojiang  and  just  0.08%  of  the  average  annual  discharge  in  the  Jinshajiang.  Environmental \nimpacts  during  construction  on  air,  water,  and  the  acoustic  environment  will  be  temporary  and \nlocalized, and if proper mitigation measures are  implemented, the impacts on sensitive receptors \ncan  be  minimized.  The  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  soil  erosion  prevention  plan  will  mitigate \nthe construction-related impacts, especially in the 65 spoil disposal sites. Environmental flows, an \nadaptive  management  plan  for  riparian  releases,  and  further  survey  on  water  use  and  in-stream \necology  in  the  downstream  reaches  of  Xiaojiang  River  will  mitigate  the  downstream  impacts. \nIndirect impacts will be mitigated through additional wastewater collection and treatment capacity \nto  be  installed  in  the  NADZ  and  EDZ  to  prevent  additional  untreated  wastewater  flows  returning \ninto the environment, in particular into Dianchi Lake. \n \n66. \nThe summary EIA complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental policy, and ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.21 It concludes that the Project will have \nsubstantial  positive  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits,  and  provide  lasting  benefits  to \nassist  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  result  in  (i)  contribution  to  Kunming\u2019s  water  supply  for \nresidential  and  industrial  needs  in  new  development  zones;  (ii)  clean  and  safe  drinking  water  for \nproject  beneficiaries;  (iii)  disproportionately  more  benefits  for  the  poor  in  the  form  of  improved \naccess to safe drinking water supply, given that they are less able to afford bottled or boiled water; \n(iv)  positive  health  implications  for  all  through  reduced  risk  of  contaminated  water  supply;  (v)  a \nreduction  in  demand  for  overstressed  groundwater  resources  in  Kunming  city  area;  and \n(vi) strengthening expansion of water conservation and water reuse programs. The summary EIA \nand EMP are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n67. \nThe Project has no unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs with proven \nrecords of safety and reliability will be adopted for water storage and transfer (tunneling) systems. \nDuring project implementation, the consultants and dam technical specialists will support the PMO \nand  IA  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works  comply  with  design  requirements  and  quality \nstandards.  Yunnan  Design  and  Research  Institute  is  undertaking  substantive  on-ground  and \nsubsurface  surveys  to  quantify  the  potential  risks  more  fully  prior  to  finalizing  the  conveyance \nsystem alignment. \n \n68. \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and  economic  viability,  and  reduce \nthe intended benefits of the Project: (i) failure to implement the water treatment plant and WWTP \nprojects  within  the  new  development  zones  by  the  time  of  project  completion/commissioning; \n(ii) failure of KMG to prevent groundwater use completely to utilize Qingshuihai water supply fully \nas soon as it becomes available (given the additional capital costs of Qingshuihai water and if the \nwater will not be fully utilized, this would put pressure on tariffs to cover debt servicing); (iii) failure \nof  KMG  to  increase  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  (iv)  failure  of  KMG  to  undertake \ndetailed  studies  and  surveys  on  catchment  areas  and  formulate  regulations  for  the  project  water \nresources protection.  \n \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n\f19 \n\nto  synchronize  with  project \n\n69. \nRisk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  through  assurances  from  KMG  on  the  provision  of  the  water \nimplementation  and \ntreatment  plant  and  WWTP  capacities \ncommissioning.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  assurances  from  KMG  on  improving \ncontrol and regulation of groundwater use, and regular tariff reviews and adjustments. KMG shall \nlevy  additional  charges  on  groundwater  use  in  excess  of  water  tariffs  to  discourage  groundwater \nuse.  Risk  (iv)  will  be  mitigated  through  assurance  from  KMG  that  it  shall  develop  a  pollution \ninventory, and establish a catchment modeling system, which will form the basis for prioritization of \nQingshuihai  reservoir  protection  options  and  development  of  an  environmental  monitoring \nprogram.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor  compliance  with  the  financial,  environmental, \nresettlement,  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  the  required  institutional  coordination  and \nproject arrangements are established for effective project implementation and operation.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and KMG have given the following \n\n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.22  \n \n71. \nFinancial.

In  the  event  KWSG  plans  to  (i)  change  the  ownership \nstructure  of  any  of  the  Project  facilities;  or  (ii)  sell,  transfer,  or  assign  any  of  its  shares;  or  (iii) \notherwise  make  any  material  organizational  change,  either  financial  or  operational,  where  such \nchange may have an adverse effect on KWSG\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under the Project \nAgreement  or  the  Onlending  Agreement,  YPG,  KMG  or  KWSG  shall  consult  with  ADB  at  least  6 \nmonths prior to implementation of such change. In the event any such change is agreed by ADB, \nYPG,  KMG  and  KWSG  shall  ensure  that  the  change  in  ownership  structure  is  carried  out  in  a \ntransparent manner and does not affect repayment of the loan made under the Loan Agreement. \nDepending on the nature of the agreed change in ownership structure, ADB shall have the right to \nmodify the repayment terms of the loan. \n \nLand  Acquisition,  Resettlement,  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development.  KMG through the \n73. \nrelevant  local  governments  and  KWSG,  shall  ensure  that  the  RP  is  implemented  promptly  and \nefficiently  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy  (1995). KMG  shall: (i) ensure that in the event of changes in the \ndetailed  design  resulting  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  no  civil  works  contract  is \nawarded under the relevant component unless the RP has been updated and such updated RP is \n\n                                                 \n22  The full list of assurances is included in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nsubmitted to ADB for its concurrence prior to award of any related civil works, and disclosed to APs \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy;  (ii)  cause  KWSG  to  prepare  and \nimplement  resettlement  plans  for  the  associated  facilities,  listed  in  the  resettlement  framework  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  any  activities \nrecommended  under  an  action  plan  to  be  prepared  by  KMG  to  ensure  proper  environment  and \nwater  quality  protection,  which  are  likely  to  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  meet \ncompliance requirements, and appropriate resettlement planning documents are prepared.  KMG \nshall ensure that an appropriate indigenous people\u2019s development plan or framework for the ethnic \nminorities in the water catchment areas affected by the future action plan for the protection of water \nresources/catchment areas is prepared accordingly. \n \n74.  Wastewater Treatment Facilities. KMG shall (i) collect wastewater and increase treatment \ncapacity for the wastewater generated by the Project, and (ii) submit the relevant plan to ADB for \nreview  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  KMG  shall  ensure  that  implementation  of  water \ntreatment  and  WWTP  projects  within  the  new  development  zones  is  coordinated  with  Project \nimplementation and commissioning. \n  \n75. \nCorporate Governance Reforms. KMG shall cause KWSG to: (i) undertake representation \nof  water  users  on  the  board  of  directors  of  KWSG  by  1  January  2010;  (ii)  undertake  capacity \ndevelopment in a timely manner on reservoir management, safety and operation, and online water \nquality  protection;  (iii)  improve  corporate  and  business  planning;  and  (iv)  improve  the  financial \nmanagement  by  1 January  2009.

The  number  of  cities  has  also  grown  from  122  in  1949  to  more  than  661  in \n2005.  The  rapid  expansion  poses  significant  challenges  for  the  provision  of  urban  services\u2014\nincluding  increased  demand  for  potable  drinking  water  supply  throughout  the  PRC\u2014putting \nincreasing pressure on the environment and posing a threat to water quality of available supplies. \nCurrently,  many  cities  across  the  PRC  experience  a  shortage  of  raw  water  supply,  while  water \nsupply  capacity  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are  still  below  targets  set  in  the  PRC\u2019s \n11th Five-Year Program (FYP). \n \n2. \nA  key  priority  for  the  PRC  under  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  is  to  ensure \nenvironmental  sustainability  by  moderating  economic  growth  and  enforcing  environmental \nprotection measures. By 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater  is  targeted  to  be  reduced  by  50%.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  need for  water  sector  reform and \nincreased tariffs was recognized. Under the Government\u2019s market-based reforms, all water supply \ncompanies and new water supply projects, including those dealing with raw water supply delivery, \nare required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. The Government is also \nincreasingly  concerned  about  the  need  for  policy  reform  and  capacity  development  to  improve \nwater  resources  management.2 People  are  more  aware  of  the  need  for  water  conservation  and \nmany  cities  have  established  a  Water  Conservation  Office.  Because  of  the  severity  of  urban \nenvironmental  problems,  the  Government  has  made  cities  the  focal  point  of  its  environmental \nprotection efforts under the 11th FYP. \n \nB. \n\nWater Sources and Supply \n\n3. \nKunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, is located on the Panlong River at the head of the \nDianchi  Lake,  in  a  region  that  has  lower  than  average  rainfall.  As  early  as  1994,  Kunming \nmunicipal  government  (KMG)  identified  14  possible  schemes  anticipating  the  need  for  increased \nwater supplies. The proposed Qingshuihai project is the preferred technical and least-cost option. \nThe existing water sources for Kunming are shown in Table A2.1. The majority of the water supply \nis managed through surface water reservoirs, including the use of water from Dianchi Lake up to \nMarch 2007. Zhangjiuhe was commissioned in April 2007, and Kunming will no longer depend on \nthe  poor  quality  water  of  Dianchi  Lake  (the  lake  has  deteriorated  because  of  increased \nurbanization,  limited  wastewater  treatment,  and  overuse  of  its  water  sources  over  the  past \n25 years).  Kunming  CGE  Water  Supply  Co.,  Ltd.  entered  into  a  joint  venture  (JV)  with  Veolia  to \ntreat  raw  water  to  comply  with  drinking  water  standards  and  distribute  water  to  the  population  of \nKunming.  \n \nThe  water  sector  continues  to  have  priority  under  the  11th  FYP  for  the  Economic \n4. \nDevelopment of Kunming City (2006\u20132010). The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing \nwater  sources;  (ii)  protecting  existing  sources  by  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution  in \n\n                                                 \n1   Background Information Report for Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.  Urban Sector Road Map for the People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China. Manila (July). \n\n2   New  technical  guidelines  for  water  resources  protection  were  issued  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration  (SEPA)  in  2007.  These  promote  and  regulate  PRC  policy  to  protect  and  prevent  pollution  in  all \nreservoirs intended as sources for drinking water supply, and for the long-term management and sustainability of water \nresources for water supply. \n\n\f26        Appendix 2 \n\nrivers,  lakes,  and  reservoirs;  (iii)  controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  and \n(iv) improving  demand  management  with  the  introduction  of  water  saving  technology,  more \nefficient  operations,  and \nthe  adoption  of  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms.  Under  water \nconservation  and  energy  saving  policies,  Kunming  is  encouraged  to  develop  effluent  reuse, \nrainwater harvesting, and recycling practices to mitigate overall raw water demand. During project \npreparatory  technical  assistance,  the  Project  provided  a  customer  satisfaction  survey  model  to \nKunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited  (KWSG)  to  ensure  that  needed  water  supply \nservices improvements are implemented. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Existing Kunming City Water Sources (2006) \n\n \nSource \nSonghuaba Reservoira \nBaoxianghe Reservoir \nDahe and Chaihe Reservoirs \nShalang River Diversion \nGroundwaterb \nChenggong Groundwater \nDianchi Lake \n          Total \nm3 = cubic meter, no. = number. \na  Songhuaba water is also directed to Water Treatment Plant No. 3, now that the need for Dianchi Lake water has been \n\n \nWater Quality Class \nIII \nII \nII \n \nII\u2013III \nII \nV \n \n\nAssociated Water \nTreatment Plant \nNos. 1, 2, 4, and 6 \n \n \n \n \nLocal treatment \nNos. 3 and 5 \n \n\nAnnual Supply  \n(million m3) \n149.4 \n15.6 \n35.8 \n11.0 \n63.1 \n2.6 \n109.5 \n387.0 \n\nsuperseded with supply from Zhangjiuhe. \n\nb  Because of water shortage, groundwater consumption has been increasing, with potential risk for increased pollution \nfrom  surface  ingress.  With  the  Zhangjiuhe  project,  and  later  the  Qingshuihai  project,  it  is  planned  that  use  of \ngroundwater will be phased out.  \n\nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \nC. \n\nUrban Wastewater Management \n\n5. \nWastewater  management  relates  to  the  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  both  urban \nstorm  water  and  wastewater.  Kunming  Drainage  Company,  under  Dianchi  Lake  Investment \nCompany,  is  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  storm  water  and  sewer  drainage \nnetwork in Kunming city. This network is old, and because of limited investment, has not kept pace \nwith  the  rapid  development  of  the  city.  Under  the  11th  FYP,  the  objective  is  to  achieve  an \nimprovement in the lake\u2019s water quality. Therefore, more wastewater treatment capacity is required \nto reduce the quantity of untreated wastewater or to improve the quality of treated effluent that is \ndischarged  to  the  lake.  Table  A2.2  summarizes  the  current  and  future  projected  wastewater \ntreatment capacity in Kunming. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Kunming City Wastewater Treatment Plant Capacity, 2006\u20132010 \nCurrent Capacity (2006) \n\nFuture Capacity (2010)a \n\n \nWastewater Treatment Plant \n\n \n\nNo. 1 WWTP \nNo. 2 WWTP \nNo. 3 WWTP \nNo. 4 WWTP \nNo. 5 WWTP \nNo. 6 WWTP \nNo. 7 WWTP \nTotal \nCoverage \n\n\u2019000 m3/day  \n\n120 \n100 \n150 \n60 \n75 \n50 \n0 \n555 \n60% \n\n\u2019000 m3/day  \n120 \n100 \n210 \n60 \n170 \n130 \n200 \n990 \n90%b \n\nm3/day = cubic meter per day, No. = number, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \na  Estimated capacity with proposed new developments or expansion of existing WWTPs to 2010. \nb  Estimated treatment capacity for city wastewater treatment by 2010. \nSource: Kunming Water and Wastewater Master Plan. \n\n\fAppendix 2        27 \n\n6. \nKunming  currently  has  six  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  with  total  capacity  of \n555,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day), sufficient to treat 60% of the dry season flow. However, the \nwastewater collection network in Kunming is far from complete, so not all of this capacity is utilized. \nSome  untreated  wastewater  is  discharged  to  the  city\u2019s  rivers  and  drains,  and  flows  directly  to \nDianchi  Lake,  especially  during  the  wet  season.  The  annual  discharge  of  combined  wastewater \nand  storm  water  into  Dianchi  Lake  each  year  overloads  the  natural  biodegrading  capacity  of  the \nLake.  In  2006,  Kunming  municipal  government  (KMG)  initiated  the  Dianchi  Lake  Environmental \nImprovement  Project  for  the  northern  part  of  Dianchi  Lake,  funded  by  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) of CNY3.83 billion ($500 million) over a 6-year period.3 \n \nD. \n\nWater Demand and Development Considerations \n\n7. \nThe  main  future  water  demand  growth  will  come  from  development  of  the  New  Airport \nDevelopment  Zone  (NADZ)  and  East  Development  Zone  (EDZ).  Current  local  sources  are \noverstressed, and in some cases water quality is poor (Table A2.1). The overall objective will be to \nprovide clean and affordable water to Kunming city and two new development zones, and relieve \npressure  on  existing  overused  sources.  The  projected  total  raw  water  requirement  for  the  new \ndevelopment  zones  would  be  about  107  million  m3/year  by  2015,  rising  to  an  estimated \n149.0 million  m3/year  by  2020,  even  after  allowing  for  improved  water  supply,  treatment,  and \ndistribution  efficiencies  through  to  2020.  Future  water  supply  and  demand  for  Kunming  and  the \nnew development zones is summarized in Tables A2.3 and A2.4.4 \n \n\nTable A2.3: Kunming Base Case Water Supply, 2007\u20132020  \n\n2007 \n(million m3) \n140.4 \n15.6 \n35.8 \n11.0 \n63.1 \n2.6 \n27.0 \n164.0 \n0.0 \n459.5 \n\n2010 \n(million m3) \n140.4 \n15.6 \n35.8 \n11.0 \n63.1 \n2.6 \n0.0 \n218.6 \n- \n487.1 \n\n2015 \n(million m3) \n140.4 \n15.6 \n35.8 \n11.0 \n30.0 \n2.6 \n0.0 \n218.6 \n104.0 \n558.0 \n\n2020 \n(million m3) \n140.4 \n15.6 \n35.8 \n11.0 \n30.0 \n2.6 \n0.0 \n218.6 \n104.0 \n558.0 \n\n \nWater Source \nSonghuaba Reservoir \nBaoxianghe Reservoir \nDahe and Chaihe Reservoir \nShalang Diversion \nGroundwater \nChenggong Groundwater \nDianchi Lake \nZhangjiuhe \nQingshuihai  \n       Total \nm3 = cubic meter. \nNote: It is anticipated that groundwater will be reduced by 2012, once Qingshuihai is commissioned. \nSources:  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited,  Yunnan  Design  Research  Institute  and  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The  project  will  (i)  achieve  a  wastewater  collection  rate  of  90%  by  rehabilitating  144  kilometers  (km)  of  drainage \npipelines  and  207  km  of  sewage  pipelines;  and  (ii)  increase  the  WWTP  capacity  by  410,000  m3/day  by  renovating \nthree existing WWTPs, building a new WWTP, and upgrade the six existing WWTPs to output effluent to or above the \nrequired standard. \n\n4   As NADZ is at an elevation that cannot be serviced from the existing city supply  without pumping, KWSG prefers to \ndevelop  an  alternative  source  that  can  supply  water  to  NADZ  under  gravity,  to  minimize  energy  requirements  in \naccordance with national policy. \n\n \n\n\f28        Appendix 2 \n\nTable A2.4: Water Demand and Supply Balance, 2007\u20132020 \n\n2007 \n(million m3) \n404.0 \n29.4 \n0.0 \n433.4 \n459.9 \n26.1 \n\n2010 \n(million m3) \n415.8 \n52.4 \n9.2 \n477.4 \n487.1 \n9.8 \n\n2015 \n(million m3) \n398.8 \n88.6 \n18.5 \n505.9 \n558.0 \n52.0 \n\n2020 \n(million m3) \n408.3 \n125.3 \n23.7 \n557.3 \n558.0 \n0.7 \n\n \nArea Water Demand \nKunming Main City \nEastern Development Zone \nNew Airport Development Zone \n      Total Water Demand \nWater Availability with Qingshuihai  \n      Net Projected Balance  \nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSources:  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited,  Yunnan  Design  Research  Institute  and  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n \nThe  water  supply  from  the  existing  reservoirs,5 while  generally  reliable,  is  declining  with \n8. \nsevere limitations during drought periods. In recent years, rainfall has been less than average, so \nthere has been insufficient water during summer months to meet demand fully, and this has led to \nrationing  and  restrictions  on  commercial  users.  The  new  Zhangjiuhe  supply  will  replace  water \npreviously  drawn  from  the  polluted  Dianchi  Lake,  and  provide  additional  supply  to  meet  current \ndemands and alleviate demand on the other small surface reservoirs\u2014Baoxianghe, Chaihe, Dahe, \nand  Shalang.  Although  they  are  generally  adequate  to  meet  existing  requirements,  their  size \n(catchment and storage) necessitates restriction to supply during drought periods. The provision of \nnew supplies will alleviate the stress on these small catchments and help reduce any demand to \nutilize  groundwater.  This  will  also  enable  any  conflict  with  declared  government  policy\u2014\nenvironment protection, groundwater protection, reduction in pumping\u2014to be avoided. \n \n9. \nQingshuihai water sources are located in the mountains of Xundian County, to the north of \nKunming.6 Because  of  the  mountains,  there  is  more  rainfall  than  in  Kunming,  and  with  limited \ndevelopment in these catchments, the water is of good quality (class I or II) while the demand is \nlower.  Analysis  shows  that  water  transfer  of  the  indicated  volumes  to  Kunming  will  not  have  any \ndetrimental  impact  on  inhabitants  of  the  source  catchments  or  the  downstream  communities. \nFurther,  Qingshuihai  makes  good  use  of  existing  facilities\u2014the  natural Qingshuihai  Lake  and  the \nexisting Jinzhongshan reservoir\u2014thus minimizing the overall need for new inundation areas. This \nhelps  to  minimize  the  need  for  any  resettlement  and  associated  compensation,  while  minimizing \nenvironmental  impacts  because  of  the  development.  This  new  source  is  essential  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  NADZ,  and  the  system  can  readily  be  extended  to  the  EDZ  utilizing  the \nbenefits of the natural topography. This would then give additional water security and good quality \nraw water for the population of Kunming city, especially for drought years.  \n \n Urban  development  in  Kunming  city  confirms  that  water  demand  already  exceeds  the \n10. \navailability of primary class (I to III) drinking water supply, and existing constraints to supply have \nled  to  suppressed  demand.  To  satisfy  future  demand,  KMG  has  made  a  long-term  water  supply \nproject  plan,7 and  the  Project  is  proposed  as  a  medium-term  action  to  meet  water  demand  in \nKunming city from 2012. The Project will transfer water from four small mountainous catchments\u2014\n(Banqiaohe,  Shiqiaohe,  Qingshuihai,  and  Xintianhe,  with  a  total  catchment  area  of  220  square \n                                                 \n5   The existing Songhuaba reservoir is the main water source for the northern and central city districts of the main city. \nLuojiaying  groundwater  is  currently  the  main  source  for  existing  development  in  the  EDZ  but,  as  this  is  unreliable, \nwater from Songmao reservoir and the  Hei  and Bai  Longtan (springs)  will be used  as  an interim supply for the EDZ \nfrom  2007  until  Qingshuihai  water  can  be  made  available.  Baoxianghe,  together  with  local  groundwater,  is  currently \nused to supply some parts of central and east Kunming city, but now Zhangjiuhe water is available, this source will be \nredirected to the NADZ during the initial construction period, prior to Qingshuihai commissioning. \n\n6   The  main  advantage  of  sourcing  water  in  the  mountains  is  that  all  conveyance  can  be  achieved  under  gravity  (no \npumping,  no  energy  consumption,  therefore  energy  saving  policy  compliant),  through  surface  contour  canals,  with \nconnecting aqueducts and tunnels. \n\n7   Planning  references:  Kunming  City  Water  Supply  Master  Plan  (1987  to  2020);  New  Kunming  City  Water  Supply \n\nPlanning (2004); and Water Supply Plan for Kunming Main City (2002). \n\n\fAppendix 2        29 \n\nkilometers [km2]) in the upper reaches of tributary streams to the Xiaojiang River (catchment area \nof 3,122 km2), which is a first level tributary of the Jinshajiang (catchment area of 473,200 km2 and \nupstream reach of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River (1.8 million km2). The total volume of water to \nbe transferred from the Xiaojiang River will be less than 12% of its annual average discharge at the \nXiaojiang hydrological monitoring station (134.4 km upstream of the Xiaojiang confluence with the \nJinshajiang), at which point the Xiaojiang catchment area is 2,241 km2. The overall impact of the \nwater transfer is to withdraw about 0.0787% of the annual average flow in the Jinshajiang. \n \n11. \nKMG  has  now  recognized,  following  experience  with  Songhuaba  and  Yunlong  reservoirs \nthat,  in  accordance  with  national  policy,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  quantify  and  plan  for  the \nimplementation  of  watershed  management  as  part  of  a  holistic  approach  to  integrated  water \nresources and environment management. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has initiated policy \ndialogue with relevant government agencies on this, to assess understanding and future intentions, \nwhich  will  extend  well  beyond  the  construction  phase  of  the  Qingshuihai  Project.  Following  the \nPRC  law  on  Provision  for  Drinking  Water  Source  Pollution  Prevention  (1980),  after  project \ncompletion,  KMG  will  delineate  the  Qingshuihai  drinking  water  source  protection  zones  in \naccordance  with  technical  guidelines8 and  issue  \u201cQingshuihai  Drinking  Water  Source  Protection \nRegulations\u201d  that  will  specify  objectives,  principles,  and  monitoring  requirements  to  ensure  the \nsustainable protection of Qingshuihai and associated water sources for drinking water supply.9  \n \nNecessary due diligence on the associated facilities was undertaken. KWSG will construct \n12. \nthe  water  treatment  plants  in  the  EDZ  (detailed  design  completed)  starting  December  2007  and \nNADZ during the period 2009\u20132012. The Project will also increase the quantities of wastewater to \nbe treated in Kunming City, the EDZ, and NADZ. Under KMG\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, the target is for \n80%  of  all  wastewater  to  be  treated  by  2010,  in  line  with  national  policy.  With  a  JBIC  loan \n(CNY3.83  billion),  KMG  has \n(Caohai)  and \nWastewater/Environmental Management Project10 over a 6-year period.  \n \nKunming Drainage Investment Company will construct two new WWTPs in the NADZ and \n13. \nanother  will  be  constructed  in  the  EDZ  by  Kunming  Xindu  Investment  Company  of  Chenggong \nfrom 2009 to 2012 as planned in readiness for the arrival of new water supply from Qingshuihai. In \nthe NADZ, WWTPs are to be constructed at the north (40,000 m3/day) and south (25,000 m3/day) \nends of the runway. In the EDZ, all the collection system was constructed at the time of developing \nthe road network, which includes a pipe network to recycle water for landscaping and parks. The \nobjective  is  to  minimize  the  amount  of  treated  water  discharged  to  Dianchi  Lake.  Based  on \npopulation  forecasts  and  water  demand  projections  in  the  EDZ,  wastewater  treatment  capacity \nrequirements  are  projected  at  120,000  m3/day  in  2011  and  200,000  m3/day  in  2015.  In  Xundian \nCounty, two WWTPs will be upgraded. According to the respective city development master plans \n(for Kunming New City, the EDZ, NADZ, and overall water supply and wastewater management), \nthe wastewater will be treated to approved national standards, suitable for reuse or for discharge to \nDianchi Lake.   \n \n \n\nthe  North  Dianchi  Lake \n\njust  commenced \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n8   SEPA. 2007.

components:  (i)  water  resources  development;  (ii)  water \nconveyance  systems;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and  project  management.  Component  1 \nrelates  to  the  development  of  infrastructure  to  transfer  water  from  several  small  catchments  into \nQingshuihai  Lake,  a  natural  lake  that  already  provides  water  to  Xundian  Town  and  the  adjacent \nagricultural area.  Component  2  involves  the  tunnels  and  associated  works  needed  to  convey  the \nwater from  source to Qingshuihai, and from Qingshuihai to Jinzhongshan reservoir for release to \nKunming and the development zones. Component 3 covers the required capacity development and \nproject  management  to  ensure  timely  project  implementation  and  future  operation  of  project \nfacilities.  \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Resources Development  \n\n2. \nThe  Project  involves  the  development  of  two  new  reservoirs  (Banqiaohe  and  Shiqiaohe) \nand  the  increase  in  capacity  of  three  reservoirs  (Xintianhe;  Qingshuihai,  a  natural  lake;  and \nJinzhongshan).  Jinzhongshan  is  a  receiving  reservoir  for  water  transfer  from  Qingshuihai.  It  is \nlocated  in  Songming  County,  to  the  northwest  of  the  proposed  New  Airport  Development  Zone \n(NADZ), and will act as the balancing and emergency storage for incoming flows for Kunming and \nnew development zones.  \n \n3. \nQingshuihai  is  currently  supplemented  by  the  water  transfer  of  flow  from  the  neighboring \nXintianhe  reservoir  that  lies  to  the  west.  However,  as  the  existing  reservoir  is  silted  up,  water \ntransfer to Qingshuihai is limited to \u201crun of river\u201d through the existing tunnel. The inlet portal to this \ntunnel also needs rehabilitation. The Tabizi Longtan springs transfer to Qingshuihai has fallen, so \nthe  small  diversion  weir  and  control  gates  need  to  be  rehabilitated  to  restore  the  supply  to  the \nconveyance channel (to be rehabilitated). Two dams (Banqiaohe and Jinzhongshan) are more than \n30 meters high and both sit across narrow valleys, so they are not very long embankments. The \nplanned  storage  for  these  reservoirs  is  quite  small,  with  only  Qingshuihai  (already  at  117  million \ncubic  meters  [m3])  greater  than  10  million  m3.  Key  concerns  that  have  been  assessed  with  the \ndesign of these dams by the project preparatory technical assistance are (i) hydrology and yield; \n(ii)  sediment  inflow  and  management;  (iii)  active  storage  capacity;  (iv)  flood  management; \n(v) structure  monitoring,  stability,  and  safety  (in  a  seismically  active  region);  (vi)  operational \ncharacteristics  to  effect  transfers;  and  (vii)  impacts  on  existing  catchments,  environment  and \ndownstream  riparian  water  users.  The  design  and  planning  were  in  accordance  with  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  safety  and  quality  standards  and  safeguard  measures.  Details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \nThe implementation plan (Appendix 8) groups all the water source dam and transfer system \n4. \nworks infrastructure together, for completion and commissioning by 2012. The works will be divided \ninto  four  construction  contracts  (Appendix  9),  with  the  Shiqiaohe  and  Xintianhe  dams  and \nappurtenant river management (during construction) and water transfer works grouped under one \ncontract.  Banqiaohe,  Qingshuihai,  and  Jinzhongshan  dams  and  appurtenant  structures  will  each \nbe  an  individual  contract,  and  by  virtue  of  their  location,  there  is  no  dependency  between  them. \nThe  Qingshuihai  to  Tongxin  Gate  conveyance  works  are  foreseen  as  the  most  critical  link  for \ncompletion.  \n \n5. \nThe  operations  rules  for  the  reservoirs  will  include  periodic  flushing  of  sediment  in \nconjunction with major runoff from the catchments. Dam designs have included appropriate water \npressure,  settlement,  and  movement  monitoring  systems;  and  will  be  linked  by  telemetry  to  the \n\n\fAppendix 4        33         \n\ncentral Qingshuihai management office. A panel of experts will review and advice in relation to the \ndams\u2019 design, construction, and monitoring.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Water Conveyance Systems \n\nThe feasibility study report outlines the scale of the proposed conveyance works to transfer \n6. \nthe required quantity of water each year effectively from the four sources to Qingshuihai, and from \nQingshuihai  to  Xundian  and  Kunming.  The  conveyance  channels  have  been  sized  to  allow  for \nvariable rate discharge, up to a maximum sufficient for the design transfer volume to be delivered \neach year. As the source river flow will be variable because of unpredictable rainfall patterns and \nrunoff,  the  conveyance  channels  have  a  flow  capacity  some  3\u20134  times  greater  than  the  required \naverage transfer flow requirement. \n \nNew  conveyance  works  will  be  required  from  Shiqiaohe  and  Banqiaohe  reservoirs  to \n7. \nQingshuihai,  and  from  the  outlet  of  the  Qingshuihai  Maichong  tunnel  to  Xundian,  and \nJinzhongshan  reservoir.  The  outlet  at  Xintianhe  and  the  existing  outlet  (Maichong  tunnel)  from \nQingshuihai  will  be  rehabilitated  while  the  transfer  outlet  from  Jinzhongshan  will  be  part  of  water \nsupply to the NADZ. The levels for the transfer inlets at Banqiaohe, Shiqiaohe, and Xintianhe are \nset to manage sediment in the reservoirs effectively, with flushing capability through the dams, to \nminimize the risk of sediment transfer to Qingshuihai, and associated risk for sediment deposition \nin  the  conveyance  tunnels.  For  implementation,  development  of  the  conveyance  systems \ncomprising  of  tunnels,  aqueducts,  and  channels  (about  72.8  kilometers  in  length)  will  be \nimplemented in three groups: (i) Shiqiaohe, Banqiaohe, and Tabizi to Qingshuihai (source inflows); \n(ii)  Qingshuihai  to  Tongxin  Gate  (regulated  flow  to  Jinzhongshan  and/or  Songhuaba);  and  (iii) \nTongxin Gate to Jinzhongshan (regulated flow to Jinzhongshan). The testing and commissioning of \nthe completed conveyance works to Jinzhongshan is scheduled on the third quarter of 2012. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Capacity Development and Project Management \n\n8. \nThis component comprises (i) project management to ensure that the project performance \nmonitoring  system  and  reporting  requirements  are  put  in  place;  and  (ii)  assistance  for  capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  on  dam/reservoir  management  and  water  quality  online  monitoring, \npublic  awareness,  corporate  and  business  planning  and  strategic  financial  planning  and \nmanagement, tariff review, and safeguards management and monitoring. The consulting services \nwill ensure close alignment between Kunming municipal government and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  management procedures and requirements while ensuring project activities are completed \nwithout  delay.  The  capacity  development  will  (i)  support  timely  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the \nresettlement,  environment  and  social  impacts  management  activities,  (ii)  establish  baseline \nindicators  for  monitoring  project  progress  and  performance,  and  (iii)  strengthening  financial  and \nmanagerial  capacity  of  project  management  office  and  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company \nLimited during project implementation and subsequent operation and maintenance stages. \n \n9. \nimplementation \nguidelines  and  requirements,  and  facilitate  strengthened  coordination  between  the  project \nstakeholders.  ADB  has  provided  general  training  in  Kunming  on  procurement  and  resettlement \nduring  project  processing,  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  integrates  PRC \ndomestic  processing  and  ADB  project  preparation  processes.  Further  training  on  project-specific \nprocurement  and  disbursement  procedures  will  be  undertaken  at  project  inception  to  reinforce \ncompliance with financial management, procurement, and resettlement procedures associated with \nthe ADB loan funded project.  \n\nCapacity  development  shall  strengthen \n\nthe  understanding  of  ADB \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\n

The  Project  involves  the  development  of  five  reservoirs  (Banqiaohe, \nJinzhongshan,  Qingshuihai,  Shiqiaohe,  and  Xintianhe)  and  the  submergence  of  land,  reservoir \nimpoundment  structures,  the  development  of  water  transfer  and  conveyance  systems,  and  the \nestablishment of permanent access roads. Once the Project is completed, about 104 million cubic \nmeters  (m3)  of  water  will  be  supplied  annually  to  the  new  Kunming  city  development  areas  and \n7 million  m3  to  Xundian  County.  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited  (KWSG)  is  the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for the Project. The project management office (PMO), KWSG, Yunnan \nWater  Resources  and  Hydropower  Survey,  Yunnan  Design  and  Research  Institute  (YDRI),  and \nrelevant local county and town/township governments have worked together to identify the project \nimpact  areas,  carry  out  physical  indices  survey  at  the  reservoir  and  infrastructure  areas,  and \nconduct  social  and  economic  survey,  with  assistance  from  specialists  of  Hohai  University,  YDRI \nand  KWSG  have  drafted  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  with  assistance  from  technical  assistance \nconsultants. \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\n2. \nLand  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  impact  upon  local  residents  at  the  reservoir \ninundation  areas  or  where  infrastructure  will  have  to  be  constructed\u2014mainly  the  dam  and  water \ntransfer  complex,  water  conveyance  routes  (entry  and  exit  to  tunnels  as  well  as  interconnecting \nsurface facilities: siphons, aqueducts, channels, and pipes) and areas for permanent access road \nconstruction. There will also be some temporary land occupation and use during the construction \nperiod. To avoid or minimize resettlement impacts, local officials and village and village committees \nwere consulted extensively during the feasibility study stages. The number of affected households \n(AHs) and affected persons (APs) are in Table A10. \n \n3. \nLand  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  involve  2  counties,  7  towns,  21  administrative \nvillages, and 41 village groups. In total, about 6,702.0 mu of land will be permanently acquired for \nthe Project, including 3,070.1 mu of farmland and 2,685.7 mu of woodland. In addition, 2,216.5 mu \nwill be occupied temporarily, including 830.0 mu of farmland and 1,240.1 mu of woodland. Some \nstructures will have to be demolished, including 80,891.1 square meters (m2) of residential houses \nand  5,982.0  m2  of  nonresidential  houses.  In  total,  1,374  households  with  5,147  persons  will  be \naffected  directly  by  land  acquisition  and/or  house  demolition,  of  which  1,137  households \n(4,295 persons)  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  without  house  demolition,  38  households \n(113 persons)  will  be  affected  by  house  demolition  without  land  acquisition,  202  households \n(753 persons) will be affected by both land acquisition and house demolition, and 292 households \n(1,059  persons)  will  be  affected  by  temporary  land  acquisition.  Existing  infrastructure  affected  by \nthe  Project  includes  1  pumping  station,  3  water  intake  dams,  3  transformer  stations,  12  bridges \n(culverts),  a  9.6  kilometer  (km)  electricity  transmission  line,  20.7  km  of  water  diversion  channels, \n29.3 km of roads, and 5.1 km of telecommunication lines. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A10: Project Impacts \n\nXundian \n\nSongming \n\nTotal \n\n42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nCounty \n\nTownship (No.) \n\nVillage (No.) \n\nVillage Group (No.) \n\nPermanent LA (mu) \n\nTemporary land \noccupation (mu) \n\nHouse demolition (m\u00b2) \n\nDirectly affected \npopulation \n\nSubtotal - directly AHs \nSubtotal - directly APs \n\nTemporary APs \n\nTotal \n\nIncluding farmland \n\nTotal \nIncluding farmland \nResidential \n\nNonresidential \n\nAHs by LA \nAPs by LA \n\nAHs by LA and HD \n\nAPs by LA and HD \nAHs by HD \n\nAPs by HD \n\nHouseholds \n\nPersons \n\n4 \n\n16 \n\n26 \n4,099.1 \n\n1,528.0 \n\n1,563.6 \n744.0 \n17,062.5 \n\n1,628.7 \n\n758 \n2,923 \n\n39 \n\n150 \n10 \n\n38 \n\n804 \n3,097 \n221 \n\n798 \n\n3 \n\n5 \n\n15 \n2,602.9 \n\n1,542.0 \n\n652.9 \n85.9 \n63,828.6 \n\n4,353.3 \n\n378 \n1,371 \n\n163 \n\n603 \n28 \n\n75 \n\n569 \n2,049 \n71 \n\n261 \n\n7 \n\n21 \n\n41 \n6,702.0 \n\n3,070.1 \n\n2,216.5 \n830.0 \n80,891.1 \n\n5,982.0 \n\n1,137 \n4,295 \n\n202 \n\n753 \n38 \n\n113 \n\n1,374 \n5,147 \n292 \n\n1,059 \n\nAH = affected household, AP = affected person, HD = house demolition, LA = land acquisition, m2 = square meter, mu = \nunit of land measure, 667 m2, No. = number. \nNote: The number of APs and AHs are calculated based on the impacts by both LA and HD or by LA only.  \nSource: Resettlement Plan, June 2007. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n4. \nThe development of this RP is mainly based on the Land Administration Law of PRC, 2004; \nRegulation on Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement for the Construction of Large and \nMedium Size Water Conservancy and Hydropower Works, 2006; Opinions of the State Council on \nImprovement  of  Post-Resettlement  Support  Policies  for  Reservoir-Induced  Resettlers,  2006;  and \nrelevant policies on land acquisition and house demolition in Kunming city and Yunnan province. \nThe RP has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), as well as other related requirements on social security policies. \n \n5. \nAn  entitlement  matrix  prepared  for  the  Project  based  on  the  following  set  of  resettlement \nprinciples  was  adopted  as  follows:  (i)  involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized \nwhere feasible; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided must be able to allow those affected to \nmaintain their pre-project standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) all the APs, both \nregistered  and  non-registered,  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  assistance;  (iv)  economic \ncompensation  must  be  adequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project \nstandard of living; (v) where remaining farmland per capita is not sufficient to maintain food supply, \ncash or real-object compensation for those whose land has been expropriated, and other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided; (vi) all those affected will be (a) adequately informed about \neligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project \ntiming; and (b) encouraged to be involved in the implementation of the RP; (vii) no land acquisition \nor demolition shall start until compensation and resettlement benefits has been agreed by all the \nAPs; (viii) compensation and resettlement will be monitored by the IA and independent monitors; \n(ix)  special  assistance  and  treatment  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups,  to  ensure  their \n\n\fAppendix 10        43         \n\nstandard of living is not impaired, and that opportunities are provided to all APs to retain benefits \nfrom the Project; (x) resettlement must be adequate to cover all the affected aspects; and (xi) all \nresettlers will receive the post-resettlement support fund to restore their livelihoods.  \n \nD. \n\nCompensation Standard, Income, and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n\n6. \nThe  compensation  for  land  acquisition  includes  a  land  compensation  fee,  relocation \nsubsidy, and standing crop compensation. The land compensation fee is CNY25,120/mu, 16 times \nthe average annual output value (AAOV) for paddy field; CNY18,700/mu for dry land, 16 times its \nAAOV;  CNY22,448/mu  for  orchard  land,  13  times  its  AAOV;  CNY6,936/mu  for  forestland  and \nCNY2,774/mu for shrubbery land, both 6.8 times their own AAOV; and CNY18,360/mu for shelter \nforest  land,  18  times  its  AAOV.  For  unused  land,  compensation  payable  will  be  half  that  for  dry \nland,  which  equals  CNY9,350/mu.  The  standing  crop  compensation  is  CNY785  for  paddy  fields \nand  CNY575  for  dry  land.  In  regard  to  temporary  land  acquisition,  CNY4,710/mu  will  be  paid  for \nirrigated land and CNY3,450/mu for dry land. The compensation standard for house demolition is \nset at CNY800/m2 for framework structures, CNY500/m2 for brick-concrete structures, CNY300/m2 \nfor  brick-wood  structures,  and  CNY230/mu  for  adobe-wood  structures.  In  addition,  infrastructure \ncompensation,  resettlement  transportation  cost,  and  other  related  fees  will  be  provided  to  the \naffected resettlers. A post-resettlement support fund will be developed, with a standard rate set at \nCNY600 per resettler per year, which will be payable for 20 years. \n \n7. \nMeasures for income-generation will include cash compensation, land adjustment, industrial \nstructure adjustment, preferential employment, skills training, and post-resettlement support. After \nnegotiation  with  the  affected  counties,  village  officials,  and  resettlers,  it  has  been  agreed  that  all \ncompensation  fees  will  be  paid  directly  to  APs,  and  land  will  not  be  adjusted  in  the  affected \nvillages,  except  for  Laoba  Village.  APs  will  use  the  compensation  for  agriculture  structural \nadjustment,  livestock  breeding,  and  nonagricultural  industries.  In  Laoba  village,  the  land \ncompensation  fee  will  be  distributed  to  all  villagers  and  land  will  be  readjusted  in  each  existing \nvillage. In all villages, direct cash support will be provided to resettlers. During construction, some \nunskilled  work  will  be  offered  to  the  APs,  for  up  to  2,100  persons/day.  The  APs  will  be  given \npreference  to  undertake  the  available  labor  jobs,  and  about  20\u201330%  of  these  will  be  provided  to \nwomen.  In  association  with  the  agricultural  department(s)  and  social  security  department(s),  the \nPMO  will  also  contribute  to  a  special  fund  (CNY320,000)  for  technical  training  of  those  affected \nworkers,  of  which  at  least  50%  of  the  opportunities  will  be  offered  to  women.  Meanwhile, \nCNY250,000 will be set aside by the PMO to provide support to vulnerable groups, together with \nassistance to be provided by the civil administration department. Minority groups will be given the \nsame rights in relation to land acquisition and house demolition as all other APs. \n \n8. \nAll households affected by house demolition will be relocated within their existing villages. \nIn  line  with  the  new  rural  construction  planning  for  each  county  and  town,  the  Government  will \nprovide  funds  for  the  construction  of  infrastructure,  such  as  water,  power,  and  roads;  and  the \nQinghai  No.  2  group,  Haiwei  village,  Laoba  group,  Deshi  group,  and  Gegentang  group\u2019s  farm \nhouseholds will be allowed to build their own houses at planned housing areas. In the groups that \nare  less  affected  by  house  demolition  (Huaqing  and  Laohaitou  and  Xiaobeidang  No.  5  group), \naffected  farm  households  can  choose  to  have  residential  land  and  build  houses  themselves, \nthrough agreement with village committee. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n\n9. \nThe  PMO  (KWSG)  will  take  full  responsibility  for  implementing  project  resettlement  in \naccordance  with  the  approved  RP.  KWSG  will  be  in  charge  of  transactions  and  the  review  of \nprocedures for land acquisition, house demolition, and resettlement, as well as being responsible \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nfor  coordination,  management,  payments,  and monitoring.  YDRI  will  be  in  charge of  deciding the \nimpact  area  of  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition,  and  providing  technical  assistance  for \nupdating  the  RP  report  based  on  designs  during  project  implementation.  Xundian  and  Songming \ncounty governments will carry out resettlement implementation and will be responsible for contract \nsigning  for  compensation  and  subsidy  payments;  procedure  handling;  compensation  standard \nidentification; compensation payments, and implementation of living rehabilitation requirements. No \nland acquisition or demolition will start until the RP is updated based on designs and approved by \nADB. The RP will be implemented from September 2007 to December 2011. \n \nF. \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n\n10. \nIn accordance with PRC national, provincial, and municipal policies and regulations for land \nacquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement,  together  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  the \nPMO/IA  will  hold  public  consultations,  negotiation,  and  information  disclosure  sessions  with  the \naffected  people,  villages,  and  county  governments  during  the  project  preparation  stage.  AHs, \nvillage cadres, town/township and county governments participated in the physical indices survey \nand  social  and  economic  survey,  and  confirmed  the  survey  results.  Through  consultations  and \nnegotiation,  APs  will  be  informed  about  the  key  contents  of  the  RP.  Further  negotiation  will  be \narranged for county/town government leaders and AP representatives prior to RP implementation, \nto  discuss  the  detailed  impacts  for  each  village  and  the  planned  resettlement  measures.  By \nAugust 2007, a resettlement brochure will be provided by the PMO and IA to all affected villages \nand households. This brochure will confirm the project affected areas, the implementation schedule \nand  framework,  the  compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition  and  other  assets,  relocation \nassistance, livelihood rehabilitation strategy, and dispute resolution procedures. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005),  the  draft  RP  was  posted  on  the  ADB  website \nfollowing  the  endorsement  from  Kunming  Municipal  Government  and  Environment  and  Social \nSafeguard Division on 18 July 2007.  The final RP was posted on the ADB website on 9 November \n2007. The PMO will set up project resettlement agencies to supervise implementation, continue the \npublic consultations, monitor progress, and deal with grievances. \n \nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement will be conducted. The PMO will carry out \n11. \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO \nwill  engage  an  independent  agency  for  semiannual  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  independent \nagency  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation,  payment,  and \ndispute  resolution.  It  will  identify  the  impacts  for  APs  on:  (i)  whether  they  have  received  the \napproved compensation and entitlements on time, and (ii) whether their living standard and income \nlevel have been restored to pre-project status. A baseline survey will be carried out before the start \nof land acquisition and house demolition. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every \n6 months during implementation and annually for 2 years after completion of resettlement. External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \nH. \n\nBudget \n\n12. \nBased on the May 2007 base price, the total resettlement cost of the Project is estimated to \nbe CNY185.68 million, which is 10.2% of the total project cost. The cost estimates include costs of \ncompensation for land acquisition, house demolition, reestablishment of special facilities, planning, \nmanagement,  training,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  resettlement  infrastructure  improvement \nbudget. The CNY17.65 million of post-resettlement support fund will be paid to resettlers out of the \ntotal  project  budget.  KWSG  will  provide  counterpart  budget  for  resettlement  activities,  including \nsupport in case of any shortfall in funds during resettlement implementation. \n\n\fAppendix 11        45         \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe  Kunming  Qingshuihai  Water  Supply  Project  (the  Project)  has  the  potential  to  benefit  3.4  million  Kunming  urban \nresidents by preventing increasingly serious shortages in their supply of water for both domestic and commercial use. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  quality  of  life  and  reduce  the  risk  of  an  increase  in  waterborne  diseases.  By  ensuring  that \nthere  is  sufficient  water  for  projected  population  increases,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the  proposed  economic \ndevelopment of Kunming as a regional center. Specifically: \n \n\n(i)  The  Project  will  assist  in  sustaining  the  PRC\u2019s  current  achievements  of  93%  (2004)  against  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7, target 10 to halve the proportion of people  without sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater by 2015. It will ensure that by 2015 up to 3.4 million Kunming residents will have access to safe water.  \n\n(ii)  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  prevention  of  up  to  an  estimated  1.5  million  cases  of  waterborne  diseases \nfrom 2013 to 2015, and the associated increase in median medical costs is projected to be likely to rise from \nCNY18  to  CNY30  per  capita  (at  current  values)  by  2015.  Health  benefits  are  expected  to  be  felt \ndisproportionately  by  women  since  they  are  more  at  risk  of  waterborne  diseases,  and  by  children  who  are \nlikely to have least resistance to such diseases.  \n\n(iii)  There  will  be  an  average  of  approximately  4,200  people  employed  each  year  on  construction  work  over \n5 years, plus 10,920 people employed annually in jobs created indirectly as a result of construction. At least \n50%  of  the  construction  jobs  will  be  unskilled,  and  the  poor  should  benefit  disproportionately  from  this  job \ncreation.  A  further  88  permanent  jobs  will  become  available  in  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and   \n10%\u201320% of these are to be for unskilled workers.  \n\n(iv)  The Project will support continued provision of price subsidies and lifeline tariffs to contribute to cushioning the \n\nimpact of tariff increases on the poor. \n\n(v)  In  the  rural  catchment  areas,  the  Project  has  the  potential  to  reduce  poverty  both  directly  through  the  direct \nand indirect creation of a total of 15,120 jobs per year over the 5-year construction period, and an additional \n229 permanent jobs in O&M. Contracts will require contractors to employ a proportion of local people, and as \nsome  50%  of  the  construction  jobs  will  be  unskilled,  many  of  these  will  be  likely  to  go  to  poor  people. \nIndirectly,  the  Project  will  act  as  a  stimulus  to  local  economic  development  in  Songming  County  and,  in \nparticular,  Xundian  County.  The  supply  of  additional  water  for  irrigation  and  commercial  use  in  Xundian \nCounty,  the  money  spent  locally  on  procurement,  and  the  upgrading  of  roads  in  a  number  of  sub-villages \nshould  further  contribute  to  economic  development  in  Xundian,  estimated  to  affect  over  30,000  people. \nSongming County will also benefit from jobs created and procurement. \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                             Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines.  The \nanalysis  collected  information  to  assist  in  the  design  of  the  Project  by  identifying  the  poor,  examining  causes  of \npoverty,  and  recommending  poverty  reduction  measures  within  the  scope  of  the  Project.  It  also  examined  social \nsafeguard  issues  in  both  the  rural  and  urban  areas  of  the  Project,  especially  with  respect  to  vulnerable  groups  and \nethnic  minorities.  Water  users\u2019  demands  and  needs,  and  their  willingness  to  pay  health  benefits  and  afford  different \ntariff levels were examined. \n \nThe project area includes a diverse range of social groups, poor and nonpoor, Han and ethnic minorities, urban and \nrural populations. The project area is all within Kunming Municipality. The water transfer area is located across two of \nthe  municipal  counties,  Songming  and  Xundian.  The  water  recipient  areas  are  Kunming  city,  the  Economic \nDevelopment Zone (EDZ) located within Chenggong County, and the New Airport Development Zone (NADZ) part of \nthe Guandu District of Kunming city. In 2006, Songming county had a population of 312,000, of which 2.7% was living \nbelow the absolute poverty line (CNY638/capita/year) and 11.5% below the relative poverty line (CNY944/capita/year). \nXundian County, classified a National Impoverished County, had a total population of 479,000, of which 9% was living \nbelow  the  absolute  poverty  line  and  37.6%  below  the  relative  poverty  line.  In  the  project  transfer  area,  two  of  the \n12 villages are classified poverty villages. A detailed poverty and social analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. The \nhealth impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nKunming  city  has  an  urban  population  of  nearly  3  million  people.  The  poverty  line  in  Kunming  city  is  CNY210  per \ncapita per month, which is the threshold for the Minimum Standard of Living Scheme subsidy. Some 41,784 people, or \n1.7% of the city population, benefit from this subsidy. Although all Kunming residents will benefit from the enhanced \nwater  supply,  the  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  residents  in  the  NADZ  and  EDZ  where  the  projected  development  is \ndependent on an adequate water supply. In the NADZ in particular, the majority of current residents are farmers, and \nalthough these will be only a small part of the projected population expansion in the future, the majority are currently \nliving  in  poverty  and  will  benefit  disproportionately  from  the  economic  opportunities  that  will  be  brought  by  the \ndevelopment facilitated by the increased water supply. \n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis and consultations were carried out throughout project preparation. Data collection carried out \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance involved interviews with over 400 households in different parts of \nthe project-affected area. It also included 30 focus group discussions and key informant interviews with village leaders; \nrepresentatives  of  Xundian  and  Songming  County  Water  Boards;  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development  Offices; \nDianyuan,  Jinsuo,  Liushao  townships;  NADZ;  and  EDZ.  Participants  were  encouraged  to  raise  issues  that  might \nconcern  them  about  the  Project  and  its  impacts,  as  well  as  give  their  overall  opinions  on  the  Project.    Positive  and \nnegative effects to these groups caused by the Project. \n  \nIn addition, in the initial design phase of the Project, the technical team from the Design Institute carried out a number \nof  consultations  with  government  agencies,  villagers,  enterprises,  and  local  groups.  Discussions  were  focused  on \ntechnical issues, environmental assessment and resettlement planning. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nProject  information  related  to  resettlement  and  environment  will  be  further  disclosed  before  the  Project  starts.  Local \npeople  will  have  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  (RP),  environmental \nmanagement plan, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), and project construction. \n \nIn  addition  to  ongoing  discussions  with  those  who  will  be  affected  by  resettlement,  further  consultations  will  be \nimplemented  throughout  the  implementation  phase  concerning  the  effect  of  current  farming  practices  on  watershed \nmanagement,  which  will  be  critical  for  maintaining  water  quality  in  the  catchment  area.  The  desired  outcome  of  this \nconsultation process would be an integrated strategy for watershed protection, as far as farmers are involved, that is \npractical  and  acceptable  to  all  concerned.  Details  of  consultation  and  participation  plans  for  implementation  are \nincluded in the RP, environmental management plan, and EMDP. \n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nMen  and  women  will  benefit  from  the  unskilled  jobs  generated  by  the  infrastructure  construction.  The  project \nmanagement  office  will  encourage  contractors  to  employ  as  many  women  as  possible.  The  Executing  Agency  will \nencourage that 30% of the new O&M jobs go to women, assuming suitably qualified women can be recruited.  \n \nWomen are fully involved in consultation processes relating to environment protection in the catchment areas, as well \nas  in  resettlement  planning.  A  procedure  is  in  place  to  ensure  women  are  integrated  into  any  income  restoration \nactivities associated with resettlement, while an environmental protection plan will ensure that women in catchments \nareas will be actively involved in training and livelihood activities. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n\fE.

Use  of \n\nWillingness  to  pay  and  affordability  analyses  were  carried \nout. For the absolute poverty group, the average water cost \nof  the  poor  is  currently  1.9%  of  the  monthly  disposable \nhousehold \nincome.  The  Minimum  Standard  of  Living \nScheme  guarantee  includes  a  water  tariff  subsidy  that \nentitles those who qualify to a discount price of CNY1.8 per \ncubic  meter  (m3)  for  up  to  6  m3 per  month.  The  household \nsurvey  showed  that  the  average  monthly  consumption  of \nwater per poor household is 5 m3. Even with an increase of \n50%, this will still be within the international threshold of 3%. \n \nYunnan  municipal  government  will  ensure  that  all  the \nemployment  and  labor  standards,  as  provided  in  the \nregulations,  are  complied  with. \napplicable \nContractors\u2019  labor  policies  with  respect  to  minimum  wages, \nequal  wages  for  equal  work,  and  occupational  health  and \nthe  contracts  and \nsafety  will  be  regulated  by  both \ngovernment \nlabor  will  be \nencouraged, and related basic training  will be supported by \ngovernment. \n \nThe  total  ethnic  minority  population  in  the  project  areas  is \n0.5 million, some 13% of the total population. Yi (35% of the \ntotal minority population), Hui (30%), and Bai (17%) are the \nmain  ethnic  groups.  There  are  no  basic  differences  in  the \nlivelihood  patterns  of  the  different  minority  groups  in  the \nproject  area  villages,  as  they  live  in  mixed  villages.  While \nthey  have  their  own  language,  most  minorities  also  speak \nHan. Land acquisition will affect less than 10 ethnic minority \nhouseholds. Related mitigation measures are included in the \nRP. Other social risk mitigation and enhancement measures \nare included in the EMDP in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nVillagers also recognized that there may be some regulation \nof  land  use  in  buffer  zones  around  the  project  dams  and \nreservoirs,  and  that  this  would  affect  some  farmers  who \nwould not be relocated or subject to land acquisition. There \nmight  also  be  the  need  to  change  some  farming  practices \noutside  buffer  zones  to  reduce  the  risk  of  contamination  of \nreservoir water with agricultural chemicals, or siltation of the \nreservoirs  because  of  slope  erosion.  A  preliminary \nwatershed  management  strategy  has  been  prepared  by \nKunming municipal government to protect the reservoirs.   \n \nAlthough  the  Project  poses  no  significant  risks,  it  will  take \npreventive  actions  by  disseminating  information  to  staff, \nworkers,  their  families,  and  local  communities  on  sexually \ntransmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. \n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nFinancial Return Analysis of Project \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 The tariffs for water \nsales  used  to  estimate  the  net  financial  benefits  for  raw  water  supplies  are  those  approved  by \nYunnan  Provincial  Development  Reform  Commission,  December  2005  and  implemented  in  two \nsteps  (January  2006  and  January  2008).  Tariffs  adopted  in  the  project  evaluation  are  those \napproved for July 2007, which will result in an estimated weighted average tariff for all consumers \nof CNY3.53/cubic meter (m3). After deducting value-added tax of 6%, plus water supply treatment \nand distribution costs of CNY1.03/m3, then CNY2.30/m3 may be attributed to the raw water source. \n \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is  computed  based  on  Kunming  municipal \n2. \ngovernment (KMG) equity contributions and the ADB loan and local bank loan, which are assumed \nto carry different nominal interest rates. The WACC for the Project is 3.7% (Table A12.1).  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nADB Loan \n\nDomestic Loan\n\n80.0 \n31.3% \n6.2% \n15.0% \n5.2% \n1.2% \n4.0% \n1.3% \n\n99.2 \n38.7% \n6.5% \n15.0% \n5.5% \n3.0% \n2.5% \n0.9% \n\nEquity \n76.8 \n30.0% \n10.0% \n0.0% \n8.0% \n3.0% \n4.9% \n1.5% \n\nTotal \n255.9 \n100.0% \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n3.7% \n\n Item \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost  \nWeighted Component of WACC \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nResults.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  at  5.7%  for  the  Project \n3. \n(Table A12.2),  which  compares  favorably  with  the  WACC  at  3.7%,  substantiating  the  financial \nviability of the Project. The net present value is CNY453.6 million. Regulatory or tariff revision risk \nfor this Project is minimal. The current tariff is sufficient to recover the operating costs and capital \ncosts.  There  is  limited  risk  of  downward  revision  since  proposed  tariffs  have  already  being \napproved through public hearings held by Yunnan Provincial Development Reform Commission in \nNovember  2005.  The  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  associated  with  corresponding  cost \nincreases,  falling  to  4.1%.  Accordingly,  efforts  must  be  made  in  project  implementation  to  avoid \ndelays and cost increases. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses \n(%) \n\n  \n\nSI \n\n  \n+10 \n+10 \n-10 \n\nSensitivity Analyses \nBase Case \nCapital \nOperating \nBenefits \nAll the above \n2-year delay plus 20% increase in CAPEX \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

KWSG,  a  company  fully  owned  by  KMG  with  a  registered  capital  of \nCNY534  million  was  formed  in  2004.  In  November  2005,  the  water  treatment  and  distribution \nassets  of  Kunming  city  were  transferred  to  a  newly  established  subsidiary,  KWSG,  which  in  turn \nestablished a joint venture (JV) with Veolia Water Kunming Investment Company Limited, to form \nKunming  CGE  Water  Supply  Company  Limited.  It  has  a  contract  to  operate  specific  parts  of  the \nKunming water supply facilities for up to 30 years. KWSG holds 51% of the shares in the JV. The \nJV operation came into effect on 1 May 2006. \n \n5. \nKWSG Operations and Subsidiaries. Water supply operations are the core business and \ncontribute  most  revenues  and  profit  to  KWSG.2 Table  A12.3  lists  the  revenues,  operating  profit, \nand assets of all the consolidated subsidiaries. The water supply operation accounted for 65% of \ntotal  revenues,  71%  of  the  total  operating  profit,  and  80%  of  the  total  asset  values.  Other \nsubsidiaries can stand by themselves without subsidy from the core business. At the end of 2006, \nKWSG  had  a  total  asset  value  of  CNY2.24  billion  ($292.8  million).  The  asset  value  of  water \nproduction was CNY1,792.6 billion in 2006, an increase of 24.7% from 2001. \n \n\nTable A12.3: KWSG Analysis of Subsidiaries in 2006 \n(CNY million) \n\nOperating \nProfit \n50.2 \n1.2 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n2.3 \n0.4 \n2.3 \n9.4 \n4.4 \n70.8 \n\nItem \n\nRevenue \n\n% \n\n% \n\nAssets \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n2,246.9 \n\n71.0 \n1.7 \n0.2 \n0.6 \n3.2 \n0.6 \n3.3 \n13.2 \n6.2 \n100.0 \n\n79.8 \n2.2 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n5.4 \n0.6 \n11.5 \n \n \n100.0 \n\n64.5 \n3.6 \n1.3 \n0.6 \n7.8 \n1.3 \n13.7 \n4.5 \n2.7 \n100.0 \n\n451.4 \n25.1 \n9.0 \n4.3 \n54.9 \n9.0 \n95.5 \n31.7 \n19.1 \n700.0 \n\n1,792.6 \n51.3 \n3.4 \n7.1 \n120.9 \n13.9 \n257.7 \n \n \n\nKunming General Water Co.

The results of financial analysis are shown in Table \nA12.4.  The  financial  profitability  improved  in  2006  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  tariffs.  The  debt \nservice ratio is very satisfactory (5.3 in 2006) once the movements in the cash flow of short-term \nborrowings  have  been  isolated.  The  current  ratios  are  1.07  in  2005  and  1.68  in  2006,  indicating \nthat  KWSG  has  the  liquidity  to  meet  its  short-term  liabilities.  The  ratio  of  account  receivables  to \nsales, as months of sales, has fallen from a high of 3.4 months in 2002 to 1.9 months of sales in \n2006.  The  JV  is  working  to  reduce  accounts  receivables  further.  However,  given  that  meters  are \nread and bills issued later in the month for payment with 21 days, accounts receivable will always \nbe  at  least  1 month  of  sales  at  year-end.  The  return  on  net  fixed  assets  is  low  at  2.2%  in  2006, \nwhich increased from 1.3% in 2004. It is expected that, with tariff increases in January 2008 and \nimproved operations under the JV, the return on assets employed will increase in the future. The \nratio of long-term debt to total equity and liabilities is low at 7.3% since the JV has no short-term or \nlong-term  loans  at  this  time.  While  KWSG  borrowings  are  essentially  long-term  (World  Bank  and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] loans), KWSG has also short-term borrowings for \nthe balance. This reflects the availability of funding to KWSG on the domestic market where only \n                                                 \n2  The other businesses of KWSG are mainly land leasing, construction, and engineering. The other business of the JV \ncompany  is  engineering  and  renovation  of  the  existing  water  pipe  network,  with  the  results  included  in  the  JV\u2019s \noperations. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nshort-term funding is available, but is able to be renewed when it falls due. In general, the historical \nfinancial performance of KWSG water operations indicates that it has been able to operate without \nany subsidies, within the tariff structure.  \n \n\nTable A12.4: Key Financial Indicators \n\n2006 \n2.2% \n5.3 \n1.7 \n2.0 \n1.9 \n7.3% \n\n2004 \n1.3% \n22.5 \n1.0 \n1.0 \n1.8 \n15.1% \n\n2005 \n1.5% \n10.0 \n1.1 \n1.0 \n2.3 \n10.9% \n\n2003 \n1.6% \n1.1 \n1.0 \n0.9 \n1.7 \n15.9% \n\n2002 \n1.7% \n6.1 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n3.4 \n18.0% \n\n2001 \n1.5% \n3.2 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n3.0 \n19.4% \n\nItem \nReturn on NFA  \nDSR \nCurrent Ratio \nQuick Ratio \nReceivables/Sales (months) \nLong-term Debt Equity Ratio  \nDSR = debt service ratio, NFA = net fixed assets. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nFinancial  Projections  for  JV  Distribution  Company  and  KWSG.  Financial  projections \nwere prepared for the JV and KWSG over the period 2007\u20132020 to ascertain the overall financial \nsustainability of the water sector. \n \n8. \nJV  Financial  Projections.  For  the  JV,  water  sales  will  almost  double  over  the  forecast \nperiod  from  229  million  m3  in  2007  to  444  million  m3  in  2020.  Total  revenues  will  increase  from \nCNY719  million  in  2007  (the  first  full  year  of  operation)  to  CNY2,390  million  in  2020  because  of \nincreased  water  sales  and  periodic  adjustments  to  water  tariffs  for  inflation  assumed  at  3-yearly \nintervals.  After-tax  profit  of  CNY21  million  in  2007  will  rise  to  CNY584  million  in  2020.  Return  on \naverage net fixed assets (historic) will increase from 0.6% to 20.0% over the same period. \n \n9. \nKWSG  Financial  Projections,  Sector  Level.  KWSG  financial  projections  include \nconsolidation  of  51%  of  the  JV\u2019s  revenues  and  expenditures  and  fixed  assets  with  other  KWSG \nsubsidiaries. KWSG is also responsible for the management and operation of Zhangjuhe reservoir, \nfor which it receives water management fees out of the tariff. KWSG is responsible for funding the \nextension  of  distribution  and  water  treatment  facilities  in  the  East  Development  Zone  (EDZ)  and \nNew  Airport  Development  Zone  (NADZ)  (about  CNY1.56  billion)  and  Qingshuihai  water  source \ndevelopment  over  the  forecast  period.  Overall  expenditure  totals  CNY4.68  billion  from  2007  to \n2020,  with Qingshuihai  water  source  accounting  for  CNY1.95  billion. This  will  be financed  by  the \nproposed  ADB  loan  of  $80  million,  a  domestic  bank  loan,  and  KMG  equity  contributions.  KWSG \nreceived CNY774 million from the JV shareholders for 49% of Kunming\u2019s water supply assets. As \nof 31 December 2006, KWSG had cash of CNY1.021 billion which it is utilizing to finance the EDZ \ndevelopments. The Zhangjuhe water source and water treatment plant no. 7 assets are assumed \nto be transferred to KWSG, which is responsible for repaying the JBIC loan and short-term loans \ntaken out to meet cost overruns.3 KWSG\u2019s debt servicing is summarized in Table A12.5 and will be \nmet from its share of JV income plus the loan repayment tariff levy, and its own revenues. \n \n\nTable A12.5: KWSG Summary Debt Servicing, 2007\u20132020  \n(CNY million) \n\nItem \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\nInterest \n\n67.2 \n\n87.5 \n\n81.3 \n\n74.5 \n\n67.1 \n\n32.0  112.8 \n\n87.5 \n\n94.5  144.7  131.2  119.1  106.5 \n\n92.5 \n\nPrincipal  19.0  120.1  120.1  190.1  190.1  190.1  295.9  285.1  295.9  368.9  359.0  348.4  247.3  257.9 \n\nTotal \n\n86.2  207.6  201.4  264.6  257.2  222.1  408.7  372.6  390.4  513.6  490.2  467.5  353.8  350.4 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank Estimates. \n\n                                                 \n3   The  JBIC  loan  amounts  to  CNY1.4  billion,  while  domestic  loans  in  December  2006  totaled  CNY958  million,  with  an \n\nestimated project cost of CNY4.5 billion. \n\n\fAppendix 12        51         \n\n10. \nKWSG Water Supply Operation Forecasts. The main revenue sources are from JV water \nsales and increase from 47% in 2007 to 54% in 2020. Income/payments from the loan repayment \nfund levy, water treatment plant no. 7 lease payments, and water management fees would account \nfor a further 20% in 2007 and 21% in 2020. Thus, the JV water distribution operations provide from \nthe tariff and in other revenues KWSG with 66% of its income in 2007 and 75% in 2020. Overall \nrevenues increase from CNY784 million in 2007 to CNY2,270 million in 2020, mainly as a result of \nKWSG\u2019s share of the JV\u2019s increased water sales. Net profit after tax increases from CNY25 million \nin  2007  to  CNY439  million  in  2020.  The  debt  service  ratio  is  adequate  in  all  years,  with  cash \navailable  for  debt  service  exceeding  1.6  times  debt  service.4 With  the  inclusion  of  Zhangjiuhe  in \nKWSG\u2019s balance sheet from 2007, KWSG\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio increases to 46% in 2009 (from 7% \nin  2006)  before  decreasing  to  22%  by  2020  (in  the  absence  of  further  debt  funding  for  further \nexpansion and development of new zones). Cash in bank in 2020 is CNY3 billion, suggesting that \nKWSG has adequate reserves to meet ongoing capital expenditure and extending water supply to \nnew development zones in the future. KWSG may also obtain further investment capital by leasing \nor  selling  out  the  rights  to  undertake  the  water  distribution activities  in EDZ  and  NADZ.  Thus,  as \nlong  as  tariffs  are  periodically  adjusted  for  inflation  (3-yearly  intervals  are  assumed)  in  the \nprojections,  the  2007  tariff  levels  appear  adequate  to  fund  the  water  sector  developments  and \nmeet  debt  service  over  the  period  2007\u20132020. 5  Details  of  the  financial  analysis  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nC. \n\nKunming Municipal Government Fiscal Assessment \n\n11. \nKMG\u2019s total fiscal revenues nearly doubled from 2003 to 2006, with average growth of more \nthan 20%, and maintained a fiscal surplus since 2001. The counterpart fund of KMG for the Project \nis CNY546.6 million, accounting for 2.2% of the 2006 fiscal revenue and 54% of fiscal surplus in \n2006.  The  funding  requirement  will  be  spread  from  2008  to  2012  so  that  annually  this  would \nrepresent  0.4%  of  the  2006  revenue  base,  or  about  10%  of  the  2006  surplus.  Further  details  of \nKMG\u2019s fiscal capacity are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n12. \nBased  on  the  results  of  the  financial  management  assessment,  it  was  noted  that  KWSG \nhas a satisfactory financial accounting system with adequate and qualified staff to manage, monitor, \nand  report  on  the  flow  of  accounting,  financial,  and  physical  progress.  Financial  statements  are \nprepared  monthly,  quarterly,  semiannually,  and  annually  to  be  submitted  to  senior  management, \nboard  members,  and  the  State-owned  Assets  Monitoring  and  Administration  Bureau.  KWSG\u2019s \ncurrent reporting has the capacity to link the financial information with the Project\u2019s fiscal progress. \nThere is also a regular review for budget utilization and physical progress by KWSG management. \nFurther,  internal  and  external  audit  controls  are  in  place  and  effective.  There  are  no  problems  in \nthe auditing reports in the past 3 years. Any project, including the current Project, will be subjected \nto a special project completion audit, executed by Kunming Branch of the General Auditing Office \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China. KWSG has had experience in preparing and implementing three \nforeign-funded  projects  from  1991  to  2007,  funded  by  JBIC  and  World  Bank.  Its  strong  team  in \nproject  implementation,  financial  and  disbursement  management,  and  resettlement  will  facilitate \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  ADB-financed  project.  However,  training  on  ADB  project-specific \nprocurement  and  disbursement  arrangements  and  procedures  needs  to  be  undertaken  at  project \ninception. \n\n                                                 \n4  A debt service ratio of 1.2 times and current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of 1.2:1. are covenanted for KWSG. \n5  The water demand projections, when calculating response to price elasticity, assume real increases in tariffs in 2011 \nand  2016  to  bring  wastewater  tariffs  more  in  line  with  full  cost  recovery,  assumed  at  an  average  of  CNY2.0/m3 \ncompared with CNY0.75/m3 for domestic water users and CNY0.90/m3  for nondomestic water users in 2007. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nKunming Water and Wastewater Tariffs \n\nTARIFFS AND AFFORDABILITY \n\n1. \nKunming  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  are  set  out  in  Table  A13.1  for  2005  to  2008.  In \nDecember 2005, Yunnan Development and Reform Commission (YDRC) approved tariff increases \nfor 1 January 2006 and 1 July 2007 (to be implemented 1 January 2008), to cover operating costs \nand  loan  repayments  for  Zhangjuhe  water  source.  In  each  customer  category,  tariffs  are  uniform \nfor all levels of consumption except for domestic, where a block tariff exists, together with a lifeline \nblock for the card-carrying poor. The lifeline block tariff is set at CNY1.8/cubic meter (m3) for up to \n6 m3/month. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Kunming Water and Wastewater Tariffs \n\nCalendar Year \n\nWater Tariffs \n\nResidential  \n\nGovernmental  \n\nIndustrial  \n\nCommercial  \nSpecialb  \n\nWastewater Tariffs \n\nResidential  \n\n2005 \nCNY/m3 \n\n1.30 \n\n1.70 \n\n1.90 \n\n2.40 \n\n5.20 \nCNY/m3 \n\n0.50 \n\n2006 \nCNY/m3 \n\n2.05 \n\n2.90 \n\n3.30 \n\n3.70 \n\n11.10 \nCNY/m3 \n\n0.75 \n\n2008a \nCNY/m3 \n\n2.45 \n\n3.60 \n\n4.10 \n\n4.60 \n\n14.10 \nCNY/m3 \n\n0.75 \n\n0.90 \n\n0.90 \n\n0.60 \n\nNondomestic \nm3 = cubic meter. \na Tariff Increase from 1 January 2008.     \nb Includes sauna, car washing, etc. \nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \n2. \nThe current domestic tariff consists of a water tariff of CNY2.05 plus a wastewater charge of \nCNY0.75, resulting in a charge of CNY2.80/m3. The water tariff (excluding wastewater) increases \nby 50% above the basic water tariff for consumption from 11 m3/month to 15 m3/month, by 100% \nfor consumption between 16 m3/month and 20 m3/month, and by 150% for consumption above 21 \nm3/month.  It  is  evident  from  the  structure  that  there  is  cross-subsidization  between  the  classes, \nwith  domestic  receiving  the  subsidy  where  the  weighted  average  tariff  in  2006  was  CNY3.60/m3 \n(water  and  wastewater),  compared  to  a  domestic  tariff  of  CNY2.80/m3  (water  and  wastewater) \nwhere the average family consumes less than 10 m3/month (90 liters per capita per day). \n \n\nTable A13.2: Current Domestic Tariff Structure \n\nBlock \n(m3/month) \n0\u201310 \n11\u201315 \n16\u201320 \n>21 \n\nWater \n(CNY/m3) \n2.05 \n3.08 \n4.10 \n5.13 \n\nWastewater \n(CNY/m3) \n0.75 \n0.75 \n0.75 \n0.75 \n\nTotal \n(CNY/m3) \n2.80 \n3.83 \n4.85 \n5.88 \n\nm3 = cubic meter. \nNote: Card-carrying poor are entitled to first 6 m3 at CNY1.8/ m3. \nSource: Kunming Water Supply Group Company Limited. \n \n3. \nThe Kunming domestic water tariff approaches the ideal in terms of its structure. It provides \nan affordable lifeline rate for the card-carrying poor up to 6 10 m3/month. The initial block provides \n\n\fAppendix 13        53         \n\nfor  10  m3/month,  while  further  blocks  are  narrow  (5  m3)  and  the  steps  progressive  (plus  50%), \nresulting in effective demand management and water conservation. \n \n4. \nWastewater charges represent an allowance for collection and treatment rather than the full \ncost  of  providing  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal.  Wastewater  charges  are  included  on  the \nwater bill and based on 100% of the billed water consumption. \n \n5. \nThe  tariff-setting  process  in  Kunming  now  reflects  standard  practice  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China.  Tariff  applications  made  by  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited \n(KWSG)  are  reviewed  and  if  necessary  adjusted  through  a  process  of  negotiation  between \nconcerned government bureaus. Approval for the adjustment is given by the city mayor, after which \nthe  application  for  final  approval  is  forwarded  to  the  provincial  authorities.  As  in  other  cities, \nproposals  to  adjust  the  tariffs  are  publicized  and  public  hearings  are  held  on  the  tariff  proposals. \nThe  use  of  public  hearings,  the  recent  tariff  increases,  and  the  introduction  of  wastewater  tariffs \nindicates  that  tariff  reform  promoted  by  the  state  government  is  well  developed  in  Yunnan. \nKunming is currently introducing the \u201cone user, one meter\u201d policy. It is estimated that, at the end of \n2006,  there  were  2.42 households  per  meter.  It  is  expected  that  this  program  implemented  by \nKWSG/joint venture company (JV) will be completed in 31 December 2009. \n \nB. \n\nWater and Wastewater Tariff Policies, Objectives, and Structures \n\nThe  following  objectives  are  of  particular  importance  when  developing  water  and \n\n6. \nwastewater tariff structures and levels.1  \n \nFinancial  Sustainability  and  Full  Cost  Recovery.  These  are  the  most  important \n7. \nobjectives  in  tariff  setting.  Kunming  municipal  government  (KMG)  has  set  water  tariffs  to \nincorporate proper operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of providing treated water. Apart from \nO&M  costs  to  be  covered,  the  tariff  provides  for  specific  charges  to  meet  water  resource  fees  of \nCNY0.23/m3 and water management fees averaging CNY0.23 m3. Financial analysis of the JV and \nKWSG suggests that tariffs provide a fair rate of return on distribution assets of water supply and \ndistribution; and provide for reservoir O&M and protection of the watershed area, sector expansion \nusing retained earnings and external funding, and overall sector debt service. In addition, financial \nprojections indicate that, where the current water tariffs are maintained in real terms with periodic \nadjustments for inflation, then increased water sales should be adequate to meet O&M, provide for \ncapital expansion, meet debt service, and allow the JV to recover its investment with an adequate \nreturn. \n \n8. \nEconomic Efficiency. The purpose of economic efficiency is to promote the efficient use of \nnational resources. Kunming domestic water tariffs promote economic efficiency through demand \nmanagement and conservation by adopting a progressive tariff, while tariffs set at full cost recovery \nsignal the cost of consumption to the consumer. \n \n9. \nPrice Equity. The aim of price equity is to base tariffs on \u201cfair\u201d criteria, and this is best done \nwhen the charge is based on costs traced to or caused by each customer. In water supply, there \nwill be few variations in costs caused by individual entities. In Kunming, there are four main classes \nof  customer  and  these  will  in  most  cases  face  similar  costs  of  supply.  It  could  be  argued  that \ndomestic customers place greatest costs on the system as their consumption is in the morning and \nevening  peak  periods,  and  additional  capacity  and  storage  needs  to  be  provided  to  meet  these \npeak demands. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. Economics and Research Department Technical Note Series Numbers 9 and 10. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n10. \nAdministrative Efficiency and Good Governance. Tariffs can promote good governance \nin  many  ways.  The  charges  resulting  from  the  tariff  should  be  clear  and  understandable  to \ncustomers, so that they can understand how they might modify their use of the service. Essentially, \nthis means that any classes, categories, and/or blocks used to vary the tariff are predictable and \nnot open to manipulation. Administrative efficiency and good governance require that the amount \npayable by a consumer can be easily calculated and billed. In general, this will depend on whether, \nin  the  area  served,  individual  consumer  connections:  (i)  take  their  water  from  a  water  company \nconnection,  and  (ii)  have  their  own  water  meter.  The  progressive  tariff  is  only  operable  where \nhouseholds have individual meters. This is expected by 31 December 2009. \n \n11. \nAffordability  and  Universal  Access.  Affordability  is  a  sociopolitical  rather  than  an \neconomic concept, and it relates to enterprises such as water supply and wastewater utilities only if \nthe national or local government so decides. The Kunming domestic tariff meets social objectives \nof ensuring that households meet their basic needs at an affordable price, while the lifeline block \nensures that the poor receive their basic needs at a price they can afford. \n \nC. \n\nKunming Water and Wastewater Tariff Recommendations \n\n12.  Water Tariffs. The domestic water tariff provides a lifeline block and a graduated tariff that \nallows poor and average households to meet their needs at prices they can afford. Thereafter, a \nprogressive  increase  in  tariff  blocks  makes  sure  that  a  demand  management  and  conservation \nfunction  ensures  progressive  consumption  is  charged  at  higher  rates.  Above  20  m3/month, \ndomestic households receive no concession and, at the current tariff, would pay more than other \nclasses  of  customers.  Accordingly,  Kunming  should  continue  with  the  present  structure,  with  the \ntop  charge  in  line  with  other  nondomestic  tariff  categories.  All  nondomestic  customers  should  be \ncharged  the  same  tariff.  There  is  no  economic  argument  for  charging  industrial  customers  less. \nThis  leads  to  economic  inefficiency  and  excess  consumption.  There  are  also  problems  with \nclassification, as customers seek to be classified in customer categories that attract a lower tariff.  \nA  rationalization  study  of  non-domestic  tariffs  will  be  undertaken  by  Price  Division  of  Kunming \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  in  2008  in  coordination  with  YDRC  to  move  towards \ngradually equalizing non-domestic tariffs by 2012. \n \n13.  Wastewater Tariffs. KMG should move wastewater tariffs to full cost recovery as soon as \npracticable  to  meet  costs  of  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  loan  for  current \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  projects.  KMG  should  consider  setting  tariffs  on  pollutant  loading  on \nthe basis of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle. As part of the wastewater tariff guidelines study2 carried \nout  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  behalf  of  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  the  following \ncharging  mechanisms  were  evident.  For  domestic  customers,  wastewater  charges  are  usually \nbased  on  water  supply  volumes  with  a  uniform  volumetric  charge  applied  per  m3  of  water \nconsumption. For nondomestic customers, wastewater is again charged on the basis of a uniform \nflat fee for wastewater of similar strength to domestic or to some prescribed limit. In most countries \nwhere pollutant loadings are above domestic levels or a prescribed upper limit, customers require \na discharge permit and are charged on the basis of their pollutant loadings. \n \nIn  Kunming,  all  customers,  including  domestic,  should  be  charged  a  uniform  wastewater \n14. \ncharge based on domestic strength effluent. For those customer categories with effluent pollutant \nloadings  in  excess  of  domestic,  they  should  pay  a  higher  charge  reflecting  the  cost  of  treating \nhigher  pollutant  loadings.  As  in  the  case  of  Hong  Kong,  China,  trade  waste  charges  could  be \nbased  on  banded  customer  industry  classifications  for  higher  effluent  discharges  applied  to \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2003.

Levels of poverty are \n15. \nassessed  using  the  number  of  people  below  the  minimum  living  standard  scheme  (MLSS) \nthreshold,  which  varies  from  city  to  city.  The  average  annual  disposable  income  in  Kunming  in \n2005 was CNY9,616 per capita, compared to CNY8,871 per capita for the whole of Yunnan.3  The \npoverty  line  in  Kunming  city  is  CNY210  per  capita  per  month  or  CNY2,520  per  annum\u2014the \nthreshold  for  the  MLSS  subsidy.  Some  34,122 people,  or  1.4%  of  the  city  population  of  2.399 \nmillion,  benefit  from  this  subsidy  and  1.7%  of  those  live  in  the  project  area.  However,  based  on \ninformation  from  the  2005  household  survey,  the  annual  per  capita  income  of  the  bottom  5%  of \nhouseholds  was  CNY2,831,  which  is  just  over  the  annual  per  capita  income  threshold  for  the \nMLSS subsidy.  \n \n\nTable A13.3: Urban Poverty under Minimum Living Standard Scheme (2005) \n\nCounty/District \n\nKunming (4 districts) \n\nChenggong  \n\n     Subtotal (Water  \n     Beneficiary Area) \nSongming \n\nXundian \n\n     Subtotal (Water  \n     Source Area) \nProject Area Total \n\nUrban \nPopulation \n(\u2019000) \n239.9 \n\n4.3 \n\n244.2 \n\n3.5 \n\n3.3 \n\n6.8 \n\n251 \n\nPoverty  \nNo. HHs \n\nPoverty \nPopulation \n\nPopulation in \nPoverty \n\nMLSS \n(CNY/capita/month) \n\n20,527 \n\n544 \n\n21,071 \n\n2,071 \n\n1,847 \n\n3,918 \n\n34,122 \n\n919 \n\n35,041 \n\n2,883 \n\n3,860 \n\n6,743 \n\n1.4% \n\n2.1% \n\n1.4% \n\n8.2% \n\n11.7% \n\n9.9% \n\n210 \n\n210 \n\n210 \n\n183 \n\n169 \n\n169\u2013183 \n\n24,989 \n\n41,784 \n\n1.7% \n\n169\u2013210 \n\nHH = household, MLSS = minimum living standard scheme. \nSources: Yunnan Province Yearbook 2006, Xundian County Yearbook 2005, and Songming County Yearbook 2005. \n \n16.  Water  Consumption. Data provided by the JV indicates that average per capita domestic \nconsumption  is  about  95  liters  per  capita  per  day.  However,  water  restrictions  result  in  some \nsuppressed demand estimated at 5%, resulting in consumption of 100 liters per capita per day or \n8.6 m3/month. The social survey indicated that the poor consume 5 m3 per month, while nonpoor \nhouseholds  consume  6.1  m3/month.  While  the  Project  does  not  result  in  any  real  increases  in \ntariffs,  the  approved  tariff  increase  of  January  2008  will  impact  consumption,  with  elasticities \nadopted in the economic analysis used to modify consumption. \n \n17. \nKMG  Poverty  Alleviation  Policies.  The  primary  program  supporting  registered  poor \nfamilies is the MLSS designed to maintain a minimum level of income and includes 6 m3 at CNY1.8 \nm3 plus a wastewater tariff of CNY0.75 per month. \n \n18. \nTariff  Impacts  on  Poor  Households.  The  Project  will  not  result  in  any  real  increases  in \ntariffs  over  those  of  YDRC  approved  tariffs  for  July  2007.  Estimates  were  made  of  monthly \nhousehold water use and the resulting household water and wastewater bill for the categories: (i) \nfor low-income (MLSS lowest 5%), (ii) average of lowest decile (10%), and (iii) average household \n(third  quintile)  based  on  household  size.  Based  on  the  analysis  summarized  in  Table A13.4, \nhouseholds in the lowest income class will not have a problem with affordability of a tariff increase \n\n                                                 \n3   YPG. 2006.

Mitigation  of  Tariff  Impacts. Poor households have little scope for absorbing even small \ntariff  increases  given  their  current  allocation  of  expenditures.  The  households  most  likely  to  be \nadversely  affected  by  the  tariff  increase  are  those  within  the  classes  of  low-income  households \nexperiencing  the  most  extreme  poverty.  Factors  contributing  to  extreme  poverty  include  elevated \nhealth  care  costs  associated  with  poor  health  of  a  household  member,  and  single  person \nhouseholds  where  there  is  no  opportunity  to  share  common  costs  with  other  people.  Such \nhouseholds may require additional support in the face of an increase in their water and wastewater \nbill. The existing 6 m3 at CNY1.8/m3 is targeted and appears to provide the best means of assisting \npoor families. However, it is necessary to ensure that tariffs are affordable to low-income groups. \nThe proportion currently spent on income is 2.0%, which is regarded acceptable. \n \nIn the case of nondomestic customer affordability survey by KWSG in 20054 to support their \n20. \ntariff application, found that water tariffs accounted for a very small proportion of expenses, so that \nany  increase  would  not  cause  undue  hardship.    While  water  tariffs  to  non-domestic  sector  have \nrisen  sharply  and  reflect  the  increasing  cost  of  new  sources,  wastewater  tariffs  represent  the \nrecovery  of  the  costs  of  the  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  of  wastewater.  Presently, \nwastewater  tariffs  to  non-domestic  customers  are  CNY0.90/m3  of  water  billed.  Full  cost  recovery \ntariffs are of the order of CNY2.0/m3. It is necessary for industry, where they discharge to a water \ncourse to meet the effluent standards, which is consistent with polluter pays principle. Discharging \nto a collection system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant should be a less costly option \nfor most industries, where proper on site inspection and standards are enforced.5 \n\n                                                 \n4   The water consumption cost accounted for 0.046% and 0.605% of total costs. For example, Camellia Hotel accounted \nfor  0.167%,  Acetate  Fiber  Factory  accounted  for  0.601%,  while  Kunming  Yunnei  Power  Co.,  Ltd.  accounted  for \n0.046%. KWSG Survey 2005. \n\n5  Where the Municipal wastewater tariffs are based on polluter pays principles, then industries should only pay charges \nassociated with collection costs and the treatment of their pollutant loading. Given that centralized treatment achieves \neconomies  of  scale  then  wastewater  tariffs should  be  affordable,  when  compared  with  on-site  options  of  wastewater \ntreatment to meet effluent discharge standards to water courses. However, it is likely that average wastewater tariffs \nfor domestic type biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand concentrations are likely to need to increase to \nCNY 2.0/m3 to achieve full cost recovery. In addition, those industries with industrial standard effluent concentrations \nshould be paying additional charges to meet the specific costs of their effluent treatment. \n\n\fAppendix 14        57         \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  proposed  Project  for  Kunming  city  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects.1 The Project is analyzed as \na  new  bulk  water  supply  to  Kunming  city,  and  the  new  East  Development  Zone  (EDZ)  and  New \nAirport Development Zone (NADZ). Accordingly, an allowance is made for water treatment, water \ndistribution, meter reading and billing, and payment of water resource fees so that the cost of the \nraw water supply project can be directly related to willingness to pay. \n \nB. \n\nRationale of the Project \n\n(iv) \n\nresources;  and \n\nfrom  groundwater \n\nThe water sector continues to be a priority sector under the 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u2013\n2. \n2010). The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; (ii) protecting existing \nsources  by  controlling  industrial  and  residential  pollution  in  rivers,  lakes,  and  reservoirs; \n(iii) controlling  overextraction \nimproving  demand \nmanagement  with  the  introduction  of  water  saving  technology,  more  efficient  operations,  and  the \nadoption of appropriate pricing mechanisms. Under water conservation and energy saving policies, \nKunming is encouraged to develop effluent reuse, rainwater harvesting, and recycling practices to \nmitigate overall raw water demand. \n \n3. \nThe  provision  of  new  supply  from  the  Project  will  provide  water  supply  for  the  NADZ  and \nEDZ,  improve  water  security  for  Kunming  North,  alleviate  the  stress  and  overuse  of  existing \nreservoirs, and help reduce any demand to utilize groundwater. This will also enable any conflict \nwith  declared  government  policy\u2014environment  protection,  groundwater  protection,  reduction  in \npumping\u2014to  be  avoided.  A  potential  benefit  of  using  less  water  from  the  small  catchments  that \nfeed Dianchi Lake is that flow through the lake would be partially restored, helping to stabilize if not \nactually lead to an improvement in the lake\u2019s environmental condition. \n \n4. \nBased  on  projected  growth  and  future  water  demand  for  Kunming  and  new  development \nzones,  and  after  assessment  of  existing  water  sources  (quantity  and  quality),  there  is  clearly  an \nidentified  need  for  Kunming  to  develop  new  water  sources  in  the  near  future.  Of  the  identified \nalternatives  available  for  development,  Qingshuihai  was  evaluated  as  the  best  least-cost  option. \nThe Project will also be: (i) beneficial for Kunming by supporting urban development and economic \ngrowth;  (ii)  positive  for  overall  public  health,  sanitation,  and  the  well-being  of  beneficiaries;  and \n(iii) provide  opportunities  to  relieve  the  environmental  stress  on  local  groundwater  sources  and \nsurface sources. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Assumptions \n\n5. \nFor the present study, the following assumptions are adopted: (i) all costs are expressed in \nearly 2007 prices, and (ii) civil works and bulk transmission facilities/pipelines are assumed to have \na useful economic life of 50 years after construction. Residual values are assumed in year 20 for \nreservoir  assets  of  30  years  of  the  assumed  50-year  life.  The  real  opportunity  cost  of  capital \nemployed  in  the  economic  analysis  is  assumed  to  be  12%  per  annum.  Capital  costs  include \nphysical contingencies but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction (as a result \nof any debt financing). Taxes and duties are assumed at 3.3% for civil works and other structures \nand  14.5%  for  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment.  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  are \nassumed  at  1.5%  of  project  capital  costs,  with  labor  costs  assumed  for  88  persons  at \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nCNY4.44 million per annum, a water resource fee at CNY0.23 per cubic meter (m3) of water supply \nand an allowance for incremental water treatment and water distribution costs, and meter reading \nand billing of CNY1.03/m3 of water sales. \n \nD. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis \n\n6. \nA Kunming  city long-term water supply plan was prepared in 1994 and reviewed in 2003. \nThe plan assessed 14 options or combined options for water delivery. Most options were rejected \nbecause (i) water quality at source was below drinking water standards, (ii) assured water source \nvolume  was  insufficient  to  provide  adequate  alternative  water  supply  without  combination  with \nother options, and (iii) electricity pumping cost was too high. \n \n7. \nAs  a  result  of  the  2003  review,  four  primary  options  (Fenglongwan,  Niulangjiang, \nQingshuihai,  and  Zhangjiuhe)  were  identified.  Of  these,  Qingshuihai  was  initially  favored  on  a \nleast-cost  basis  (low  unit  costs  for  water  and  no  pumping)  but  administrative  issues  related  to \nQingshuihai  could  not  be  resolved  (Xundian  and  Songming  counties  were  not  then  a  part  of \nKunming  municipality).  For  administrative  reasons,  Zhangjiuhe  was  chosen  over  Qingshuihai  for \nimplementation  under  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  was  commissioned  in  April \n2007. The discounted costs per m3 over a 20-year period at a 12% discount rate are CNY1.90 for \nZhangjiuhe, CNY1.85 for Qingshuihai, and CNY2.41 for Fenglongwan. Accordingly, Qingshuihai is \nnow regarded the least-cost option for proposed water resource development. \n \nE. \n\nWater Demand Projections \n\nFuture  water  demand  projection  for  the  period  2006\u20132020  has  been  prepared  in  line  with \n8. \nADB guidelines which relate demand to expected future increases in income and changes in water \ntariffs  for  domestic  consumption  assuming  100  liters  per  capita  per  day,  and  the  equivalent  of \n175 liters per capita per day for nondomestic consumption. The population of Kunming is projected \nto increase from 2.76 million in 2006 to 3.1 million in 2020, at less than 1% per annum. Population \ngrowth in Kunming is based on EDZ population increasing from 0.16 million in 2006 to 0.95 million \nin  2020,  and  NADZ  population  increasing  from  around  20,000  (predominantly  rural)  in  2006  to \n180,000 by 2020. On this basis, the projected additional raw water requirement for Kunming, EDZ, \nand  NADZ  would  be  about  107  million  m3/year  by  2015,  rising  to  an  estimated  149.0  million \nm3/year  by  2020,  even  after  allowing  for  improved  water  supply,  treatment,  and  distribution \nefficiencies through to 2020. In practice, Kunming municipal government (KMG) is likely to reduce \nthe  use  of  existing  water  sources  and  utilize  the  better  quality  water  available  from  Qingshuihai \nfrom  2013.  The  overall  future  water  supply  and  demand  for  Kunming  and  the  new  development \nzones is summarized in Table A14.1. Details are in Supplementary Appendixes A and M. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Water Demand and Supply Balance, 2007\u20132020 \n\n \nArea Water Demand \nKunming Main City \nEastern Development Zone \nNew Airport Development Zone \n     Total Water Demand \nWater Availability with Qingshuihai  \n     Net Projected Balance  \nm3 = cubic meter.  \nSources:  Kunming  Water  Supply  Group  Company  Limited,  Yunnan  Design  Research  Institute  and  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance model. \n \n\n2020 \n(million m3) \n408.3 \n125.3 \n23.7 \n557.3 \n558.0 \n0.7 \n\n2015 \n(million m3) \n398.8 \n88.6 \n18.5 \n505.9 \n558.0 \n52.0 \n\n2010 \n(million m3) \n415.8 \n52.4 \n9.2 \n477.4 \n487.1 \n9.8 \n\n2007 \n(million m3) \n404.0 \n29.4 \n0.0 \n433.4 \n459.9 \n26.1 \n\n\fAppendix 14        59         \n\nF. \n\nRaw Water Fees for Reservoir Operations and Management, Catchment Protection \n\n9. \nThe tariff provides for the payment of raw water fees made up of a water resource fee of \nCNY0.23/m3  and  a  water  management  fee  of  CNY0.20/m3.  These  fees  are  levied  on  water \nsupplied  to  water  treatment  plant.  The  water  management  fee  is  transferred  to  the  reservoir \noperator to meet operation and maintenance costs, while the water resource fee is transferred to \nProvincial and Municipal Finance Bureaus to be used for compensation to affected persons in the \ncatchment areas because of change to environment-friendly farming practices. \n \nIn  respect  to  reservoir  management,  the  Qingshuihai  feasibility  study  report  provided  for \n10. \nstaff of 88 persons and 1.5% of capital costs for reservoir operation and maintenance (O&M). This \nrepresents  CNY26  million  per  annum,  or  a  fee  of  CNY0.25/m3.  Benchmarking  material  costs \nagainst Australian experiences indicates that this fee would be adequate to meet O&M costs over \nthe first half (25 years) of the assets\u2019 lives. Capacity development also provides for Kunming Water \nSupply Group Company Limited to prepare a detailed budget to support an application to KMG for \nthe level of fee necessary to support adequate O&M for Qingshuihai reservoir. \n \nThe  water  resource  fee  (50%  represents  CNY12.0  million  per  annum)  transferred  to \n11. \nKunming  Financial  Bureau  will  be  used  directly  to  support  compensation  policies  for  affected \npersons  in  the  watershed  area,  where  adopting  more  environment-friendly  policies  would  lead  to \nloss  of  income.  In  addition,  ongoing  KMG  programs  and  subsidies  can  be  applied  to  affected \npersons  to  compensate  them  for  adopting  more  environment-friendly  farming  practices  and/or \npoverty alleviation measures. It is unnecessary to establish a specific project fund for this purpose \nunder the Project. ADB will encourage KMG to provide a comprehensive program of compensation \nand support. \n \nG. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nBenefits  are  associated  with  the  improvement  in  water  supply  treatment  and  distribution \n12. \nservices and include the provision of a 24-hour service in areas currently experiencing interrupted \nservice,  increased  security  of  supply,  improved  drinking  water  quality,  improvements  in  system \npressure, reduced risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens in delivered tap water, and reductions \nin non-revenue water. \n \n13.  Water  supply  benefits  are  estimated  using  a  willingness  to  pay  approach.  Consumer \nwillingness  to  pay  for  water  was  estimated  for  domestic  consumers  through  contingent  valuation \napproach as part of the socioeconomic survey. The value of domestic water was estimated based \non expected improvement in present water quality and the increased quantity of water that will be \nprovided in the future. The value of present quality water was taken as the CNY2.8/m3 tariff now \npaid,  which  includes  CNY0.75/m3  for  wastewater.  Respondents  were  then  asked  how  they  felt \nabout  the  approved  rise  of  20%  in  the  tariff  on  1  July  2007  to  CNY3.2/m3  tariff,  which  includes \nCNY0.75/m3  for  wastewater.  The  value  of  higher  quality  water  was  taken  from  household  survey \ndata,  which  indicated  that  people  on  average  were  willing  to  pay  CNY4.35/m3  for  such  water \nbecause of increased observed quality and expected increases in quantity. \n \n14. \nIn  the  case  of  nondomestic  customers,  which  have  also  faced  severe  quota  restrictions, \nwith quotas being reduced to service domestic areas, over the last 3 drought years, it is assumed \nthat their willingness to pay for improved water quality and volumes would be at least as high as \ndomestic  customers,  i.e.,  a  minimum  of  36%  above  the  proposed  tariffs.  This  would  equate  to  a \nwillingness-to-pay  tariff  of  CNY5.76/m3  based  on  a  proposed  average  nondomestic  tariff  of \nCNY4.24/m3  by  1  July  2007.  This  fits  within  the  range  of  the  value  of  industrial  water  estimated \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nfrom the value added to industrial output by water input.2 The estimate for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) as a whole was CNY5/m3 in 2002; for northern PRC, the average was CNY6.32. \n \n15. \nThe willingness to pay results reflect the provision of treated potable water to urban users. \nTo  determine  the  share  of  willingness  to  pay  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  raw  water  source,  it  is \nnecessary to deduct the share of the benefit related to water treatment and distribution. This has \nbeen achieved by calculating the average incremental economic cost for potable water and for raw \nwater,  by  deducting  the  costs  of  water  treatment  and  distribution  amounting  to  CNY1.03/m3.  The \nresults  are summarized  below,  and  demonstrate  that  78% of  the  willingness-to-pay  value  can  be \nallocated to the raw water source over the life of the Project. The benefit attributed to the Project is \nCNY3.38/m3. \n \nH. \n\nSummary of Economic Analysis Results \n\n16. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  20.1%.  The  EIRR  of  the \nProject exceeds 12%. The net present value at 12% is CNY1,084.1 million. An analysis to test the \nsensitivity  of  the  EIRR  of  the  water  supply  projects  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables  was \nundertaken.  The  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  that  may  result  in  real  capital  cost  increases \nand  a  delay  in  benefits,  as  the  plant  is  commissioned  later.  In  particular,  a  project-specific \nsensitivity that reflects cost increases and delays demonstrates that a 2-year delay with 20% cost \nincreases results in the EIRR declining to 16.2%. Although the EIRR is still well above 12%, efforts \nmust  be  made  in  project  implementation  to  avoid  such  delays  and  cost  increases.  Where \ngroundwater use continues at half of 2007 levels rather than eliminated, the EIRR falls to 16.5% as \nutilization  of  Qingshuihai  is  delayed.  Where  the  willingness  to  pay  of  nondomestic  users  was \nreduced by 50%, the EIRR falls to 15.1%. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Qingshuihai Project EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nSIa \n\nSVb \n\n  \n\n \n \n+10% \n+10% \n-10% \n\nSensitivity Analysis \nBase Case \nCapital \nOperating \nBenefits \nAll the above \n2-year delay with 20% increase in CAPEX \nGroundwater use continues at 30 million m3/year \nWillingness to pay of nondomestic reduced by 50% \nEOCC \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, EOCC = economic opportunity cost of capital, m3 \n= cubic meter, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \na   Sensitivity  indicator  is  the  ratio  of  percentage  change  in  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  to  the  percentage  change  in  a \n\nEIRR \n20.1% \n18.8% \n19.9% \n18.5% \n17.1% \n16.2% \n16.5% \n15.1% \n12.0% \n\n61.9% \n524.1% \n-50.4% \n  \n  \n\n6.5% \n0.8% \n8.0% \n\n \n  \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nvariable.
