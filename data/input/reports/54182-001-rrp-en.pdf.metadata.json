The  first \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala. \nThe number remained low until mid-March but has increased rapidly since then. By 19 April 2020, \nIndia had reported 16,115 confirmed cases, 2,301 cured and discharged cases, and 519 deaths \nacross India.2 India faces serious shortage in medical staff and necessary facilities and equipment. \nAssuming the worst-case scenario of 2.2 million infected people, the existing intensive care unit \ncapacity of 57,000 beds will need to be doubled and all of them will have to be equipped with \nventilators.  \n \n3. \nThe large poor and vulnerable segment is facing high risk of infection and loss of \nincome. About 270 million people are living under the national poverty line and about 81 million \npeople live in densely populated urban areas, with limited access to health services and hygiene, \ncongested  housing,  and  poor  health-seeking  behaviors. 3  They  face  high  risk  of  community \ntransmission. At the same time, the quarantine and social distancing measures have left many \nwithout a source of income. This would lead to as large a population as 104 million who are above \ninternational poverty line ($3.2/day) falling into poverty if consumption decreased by 10% due to \nCOVID-19 restrictions (para. 11). \n \nIndia bracing for economic and fiscal shocks. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has \n4. \nslashed the FY2021 economic growth forecast for India to 1.9%, down by around 3.9 percentage \npoints  over  its  January  2020  forecast.4 Depressed  economic  activity  will  disrupt  the  revenue \ntargets of Government of India. On the other hand, the government\u2019s COVID-19 response plan \nand  other  measures  entail  much  higher  public  spending.  Fiscal  deficit  is  therefore  likely  to \nincrease significantly. The domestic borrowing plan is already significantly enhanced, which has \nraised  pressure  on  bond  yields.  High  domestic  borrowing  will  not  only  crowd  out  private \ninvestment, which is critical to post-pandemic recovery, but also increase future interest payments \non  public  debt.  Timely  and  low-cost  financial  assistances  in  convertible  currencies  from \ndevelopment partners will help alleviate the pressure on domestic financial conditions and support \nthe rupee as foreign capital flows out. \n \nThe proposed CARES Program. The government has identified COVID-19 containment, \n5. \nprevention and cure, and mitigating its adverse socio-economic consequences on the poor and \nvulnerable  as  the  immediate  priority.  The  CARES  Program,  under  the  CPRO  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), will provide critically needed support to help the government mitigate \nthe  severe  health,  social,  and  economic  impacts  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.

It is timely, relevant, \nand well-aligned with the government\u2019s phased approach. \n \nIndia meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under the Countercyclical Support \n6. \nFacility,  which  include  adverse  impact  of  exogenous  shock,  countercyclical  development \nexpenditures, robust macroeconomic management, undertaking of key structural reforms, public \ndebt levels maintained at sustainable levels, and coordination with IMF (Table 1).5 The CARES \nProgram is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.6  \n\n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n1. Adverse impact of \n\nexogenous shocks  \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nIMF has slashed the FY2021 economic growth forecast to 1.9%, down by 3.9 \npercentage  points  from  5.8%  in  the  January  2020  forecast.  Recent  ADB \nestimates  show  that  the  GDP  growth  could  fall  to  1.4%  under  longer \ncontainment with a projected 104 million people at risk to fall below $3.2/day \npoverty.7 Correspondingly,  India\u2019s  fiscal  position  is  under  stress.  The  gross \nfinancing  requirement  has  significantly  increased  due  to  the  crisis.  The \ngovernment\u2019s large domestic borrowing plan has already raised the yields on \ngovernment bonds and is likely to crowd out the private sector. The financial \nsector stress will also be pronounced against the backdrop of recent episodes \nof  stressed  balance  sheets  across  some  banks  and  non-banking  financial \ninstitutions  and  given  the  cash  flow  problems  faced  by  liquidity  constrained \nMSMEs.  \n \n\nThe government\u2019s COVID-19 response program includes (i) a $2 billion health \nsector project to rapidly ramp up test-track-treatment capacity; and (ii) a $23 \nbillion pro-poor relief package under PMGKY which will provide (a) additional \nsocial  protection  measures  targeting  the  poor,  vulnerable  population,  and \ndisadvantaged  groups  including  women  and  (b)  insurance  coverage  for  all \ntypes  of  health  workers  engaged  in  the  COVID-19  response.  Significantly, \n65% of this package is in the form of direct social assistance and protection \nto the poor and vulnerable, including women. \n \nIn addition to this central government program, various state governments \nhave also initiated countercyclical measures. \n \nThe  fundamentals  of  the  economy  were  strong  pre-shock.  India  was  the \nworld\u2019s fastest growing large economy during 2014\u20132018 supported by sound \nmacroeconomic management and economic development policies that have \ncontributed to substantial reduction in poverty.8 Public debt-to-GDP ratio has \ndeclined over the past decade while the government is putting serious efforts \non \nthe  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget \nManagement Act, 2003, as amended in 2018.

The  government  has  rolled  out  a  series  of  structural  reforms, \nincluding  introduction  of  goods  and  services  tax,  and  lowering  of  corporate \ntaxes to boost investment and income tax reforms. India has adopted inflation \ntargeting in February 2015, which led consumer price index-based inflation to \nfall from a  high  of  12.3% in FY2010 to 4.8% in FY2020, within the inflation \ntargeting range of 2%-6%. 9 The pro-poor relief package is conducted within \na sound budgetary framework.   \n\n \nThe  government  has  acted  swiftly  to  contain  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and \nmitigate economic, social, and health impacts. The government has set up 11 \nEmpowered Groups to identify problem areas and ensure proper planning and \ncoordination  across  ministries  for  time-bound  implementation  of  COVID-19 \nprograms.10 Further, a COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force has been \nset up under the  leadership of the Finance Minister to undertake fiscal  and \nmonetary measures in coordination with the RBI.  \n \n\nIMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s debt as \nlikely sustainable due to a favorable growth-interest rate differential (footnote \n9). The public debt to GDP ratio was 69.9% in FY2019 and 72.2% in FY2020.11 \nVarious stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the risks to India\u2019s debt \nsustainability  remain  contained.  The  additional  borrowing  under  the  ADB\u2019s \nCARES  Program,  proposed  MSME  finance  project  loan,  and  infrastructure \nfinance  project  loan  ($2  billion  combined),  the  World  Bank\u2019s  COVID-19 \nassistance ($2 billion combined), and $500 million each from AIIB and NDB \nwill increase the public debt to GDP ratio by about 0.2 percentage points from \nthe  ADB  baseline  (77.2%)  in  the  first  two  years,  peaking  in  FY2022,  and \ngradually  converge  to  the  baseline  to  be  0.1  percentage  points  higher  by \nFY2025 as amortization increases.  \n \nADB has closely coordinated with IMF on the macroeconomic situation and \nCOVID-19 impact.

Rolling Updates on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (accessed on 29 March 2020). \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the number of cases outside of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  has  grown  exponentially  from  beginning  of  March  2020.  The \nCOVID-19  infection  has  spread  to  213  countries,  areas,  or  territories,  reaching  2,074,529 \nconfirmed cases and 139,378 deaths within three months.13 \n \n8. \nRapid increase of COVID-19 in India. While the number of confirmed cases is increasing \nrapidly, India  is still  at  the stage  of  clusters  of  cases where  several  occur  in  close  proximity  in \nterms of both time and geography.14 Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, \nand Tamil Nadu have more than 1,000 confirmed cases each while 20 states or union territories \nhave less than 50 cases. Like most countries around the world, India has been trying to contain \nCOVID-19 as much as possible to protect lives and avoid health system collapse by implementing \nsocial distancing, community quarantine, and testing and tracking. From the perspective of social \ndeterminants  of  health,  a  huge  number  of  poor  people  living  in  urban  slums  are  vulnerable to \nCOVID-19 in India (para. 3). India has more than 140 million inter- and intra-state migrant workers \nwho have been particularly affected. A great number of vulnerable people are at high risk of large \ncommunity transmission.   \n \n9. \nHealth system. While the government is committed to universal health coverage and has \nimplemented key health sector interventions such as the National Health Mission for the poor and \nvulnerable,  public  health  expenditure  in  India  remains  at  about  1%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP). India continues to face persistent risk with communicable diseases accounting for 27.5% \nof  all  deaths. 15 It  also  has  a  serious  shortage  of  medical  staff  and  necessary  facilities  and \nequipment,  with  0.8  physician  and  0.7  hospital  bed  per  1,000  people.16 It  is  estimated  that  a \nmaximum 57,000 beds in intensive care units are available, less than half of which (25,000) have \nventilators.17 Assuming the worst-case scenario of 2.2 million infected people,18 India would need \n110,000 intensive care units equipped with ventilators.

The national \nestimates show that 21.2% of the population lived below the national poverty line in FY2012.23 \nRecent estimates in 2018 shows that about 40.2% of the population or 544 million poor are living \nbelow international poverty line of $3.2/day and are vulnerable to sudden and prolonged income \nshocks that may drive them back into extreme poverty.24 Depending upon the length of the crisis \nand the severity of economic and social impacts, poverty simulations show that the number of \n$3.2/day poor could increase by up to 104 million compared with the scenario without COVID-19. \nWomen would be more impacted by the pandemic as they have a higher probability of exposure \nto COVID-19, being the primary caregivers to the family and taking up high proportion of frontline \nhealth workers (para. 43).  \n \n12. \nUnemployment in the formal and informal sectors.

Among  the  regular  wage  or  salaried  employees  in  the  non-agriculture \nsector, about 71.1% do not have a written job contract and 54.2% are not eligible for paid leave. \nNearly half of the employed workers are self-employed, 22.8% earn a regular wage or salary and \nthe  remaining  24.9%  are casual  workers.  A  prolonged  widespread  lockdown and  disruption  to \neconomic activities make these people particularly vulnerable to the loss of jobs and livelihoods. \n \n13. \nElevated financial and corporate sector stress. Since the pandemic\u2019s international and \ndomestic spread, India\u2019s domestic financial conditions have tightened significantly with both stock \nprices  and  Indian  rupee  falling  sharply.  The  Bombay  Stock  Exchange\u2019s  main  index  (BSE \nSENSEX) has declined by 23.0% from 28 February to 31 March 2020, erasing more than \u20b933.4 \ntrillion  ($445  billion)  in  market  capitalization  (Figure  1). 26  Data  from  the  National  Securities \nDepository Limited show that foreign institutional investors pulled out more than \u20b91.2 trillion ($16 \nbillion) in March alone.27 The Indian rupee has depreciated by 5.9% from early January. Since \nearly  March,  yields  on  10-year  government  bonds  have  risen  by  about  40  basis  points  (bps), \ndespite a reduction of 75 bps in the Repo Rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central \nbank). As a result, the yield curve of government securities has steepened with the yield spread \nwidening by about 100 bps, indicating much tighter liquidity conditions (Figure 2). The rapid onset \nof the crisis makes it too early to accurately gauge increases in nonperforming loans against a \nbackdrop  of  recent  episodes  of  stressed  balance  sheets  across  some  banks  and  nonbanking \nfinancial companies. Based on a review of the aggregate loan portfolio composition of the entire \nbanking system, the banking sector reported lending concentrations in  industry (31.3% of total \nloans), transport, tourism and hospitality (2.1%), wholesale and retail trade (6%), and commercial \nreal estate activities (2.6%) as at the end of February 2020.28 These exposures total \u20b937.5 trillion \n($500  billion)  and  represent  42%  of  total  loans  and  about  twice  the  systems\u2019  consolidated \n\ncapital\u2014a significant exposure. The corporate segment is also exposed to substantial risk.

Before  the  pandemic  struck,  the  central  government  had \n14. \ncommitted  to  a moderate  path  of  fiscal  consolidation  in  its  FY2021  budget,  lowering  the  fiscal \ndeficit from 3.8% of GDP in FY2020 to 3.5% of GDP in FY2021, and gradually to 3.1% in FY2023. \nThe  gross tax  to GDP ratio  was  projected to be  stable  at  about  10.8%  in FY2021,  and  10.7% \nduring FY2022 and FY2023. The government\u2019s gross tax revenue was targeted to grow by 12.0% \nin  FY2021. 30  Disruptions  to  economic  activities  will  undermine  this  effort.  In  addition, \ndisinvestment targets may not be achieved in the difficult market environment. On the other hand, \nthe government\u2019s COVID-19 response plan and other measures entail increased public spending \non  healthcare,  social  protection,  and  economic  support.  Fiscal  stimulus  may  also  be  required \nduring FY2021 to support economic revival, further increasing the fiscal pressure.  \n \n15. \nPhased  approach.  The  government  has  taken  pre-emptive,  proactive  and  multisector \nmeasures to fight COVID-19 and mitigate its economic, social, and health impacts. It has adopted \na  sequential  approach  to  prioritize  the  containment,  prevention  and  cure  of  COVID-19,  while \nmitigating its adverse socioeconomic consequences on the poor and vulnerable. It will follow this \nup with other measures for economic revival as the  lockdown is selectively lifted. The plan for \ngradual  relaxation  from  lockdown  includes  minimum  enforcement  guidelines  for  opening  up \nagricultural activities, manufacturing, logistics, and ecommerce.  \n \n16. \nDeclaration of COVID-19 as \u201cnotified disaster\u201d. On 14 March 2020, invoking powers \nunder the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the disease was declared a notified disaster as the initial \nadministrative  step  to  enhance  preparedness  for  and  containment  of  the  virus\u2014including \nscreening  at  the  points  of  entry,  contact  tracing,  and  follow-up  of  confirmed  cases. 31 \nSimultaneously, state governments started taking response measures. The National Centre for \nDisease  Control  activated  the  Strategic  Health  Operations  Centre  to  provide  command  and \ncontrol functions and opened a helpline to answer public queries. On 24 March 2020, the Ministry \nof Home Affairs issued an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, directing all central \nand  state  level  to  take  effective  measures  for  ensuring  social  distancing.  The  government \nconstituted  11  Empowered  Groups  of  officers  to  identify  problem  areas  and  ensure  proper \nplanning and time-bound implementation of the COVID-19 response. These intersectoral groups \nhave  been  active  in  resolving  issues  with  critical  supplies  such  as  PPE  by  engaging  with \nmanufacturers and suppliers. India has been spearheading a joint South Asian Association for \nRegional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  COVID-19  response  strategy,  under  which  India  has  pledged \n$10 million to a SAARC emergency fund. The plan also calls for India to work with its neighbors \nto implement joint surveillance measures.  \n \nThe Reserve Bank of India\u2019s quick response. In early March when financial markets \n17. \nbecame  volatile due to  the  pandemic,  RBI  injected  liquidity  of  \u20b92.8 trillion  ($37  billion,  1.4%  of \nGDP) through various instruments. On 27 March 2020, the RBI announced liquidity measures to \nthe tune of \u20b93.7 trillion (1.8% of GDP) across three measures in response to the pandemic: long-\nterm repo operations, a cash reserve ratio cut of 100 bps, and an increase in the marginal standing \nfacility to 3% of the statutory liquidity ratio. It cut its policy rate by 75 basis points to 4.4%, the \nlowest  ever.  All  lending  institutions  will  allow  a  3-month  moratorium  on  term  loans  and  defer \ninterest payments on working capital (footnote 4). In March 2020, when Indian financial markets \njoined a global sell-off in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the RBI undertook open market \noperations and United States (US) dollar\u2013rupee swaps to ensure adequate Indian rupee and US \n\n30   Government of India. 2020.

The central technical agencies under the Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare (MOHFW), with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) \nand other development partners, have issued guidelines on surveillance, testing, case tracking, \nquarantine, case management, health personnel, use of PPE, and management of dead bodies.33 \nThe  testing  regime  has  been  updated  thrice  and  more  testing  laboratories  are  becoming \naccredited  (including  private  sector  laboratories)  incorporating  the  latest  WHO  advisory.  The \ngovernment procured 1 million testing kits, and testing capacity rapidly increased to 18,000 by 6 \nApril 2020, through a network of 136 government and 56 private laboratories.34 The virus test will \nbe augmented by a rapid antibody-based blood test for COVID-19 as a strategy for areas reporting \ncluster  infection  and  in  large  migration  gatherings  and  evacuees  centers. 35  The  states  are \nimplementing  the  public  health  response  to  the  pandemic  under  the  National  Health  Mission, \nwhich has well established implementation arrangements. Critical trainings for health workers are \nbeing  conducted.  The  government  aims  to  add  100,000  isolation  wards.  About  20,000  train \ncoaches  were converted  to  isolation wards  and several  stadiums  are being  converted  to  large \nscale  isolation  facilities  in  preparation  for  a  case  surge.  More  than  600  hospitals  have  been \ndesignated  as  dedicated  COVID-19  care  centers.  The  MOHFW  has  already  disbursed  \u20b9411 \nmillion to states and union territories for emergency response.36 Risk communications, such as \nmass texting advisories, have been carried out in conjunction with telecom providers to reach as \nwide a population as possible.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program  \n\n \nAmong the wide range of the government measures to address the pandemic impact, the \n19. \nCARES Program will focus on addressing the immediate needs of vulnerable groups for 3 months \nwhile stepping up the health sector response.

Under the project, the MOHFW \nis providing essential supplies such as PPE, significantly increasing the testing capacity through \na network of public and private laboratories and the introduction of antibody-based blood tests to \nspeed  up  the  detection  of  cluster  infection;  introducing  mobile  application,  Arogya  Setu,  using \nBluetooth for effective infection path tracking; supporting districts to increase isolation wards at \ndistrict  hospitals  and  medical  colleges;  enhancing  risk  communication  and  community \nengagement using information technology as well as frontline health workers.  \n\n21. \nIn  addition  to  the  urgent  activities  undertaken  (para.  18),  several  actions  have  been \ncompleted to ensure effective implementation of the project (footnote 37). Key actions include: (i) \nthe  Containment  Plan  for  Large  Outbreaks  of  COVID-19;  (ii)  Micro  Plan  for  Containing  Local \nTransmission of COVID-19; (iii) guidance for states on social distancing issued by MOHFW; (iv) \nguidelines for healthcare providers for safe and effective response to COVID-19; (v) guidelines or \nadvisories  for  states  on  migrant  worker  quarantines,  psychosocial  support,  and  grievance \nredressal  while  responding  to  COVID-19;  and  (vi)  a  dedicated  page  for  COVID-19  related \ncategories on the government\u2019 e-Marketplace for faster procurement of COVID-19 related items.  \n\n \n\n \n\n22. \nA $23 billion pro-poor economic relief package. The Finance Minister announced the \nPrime Minister\u2019s  Welfare  Scheme for  the  Poor  (PMGKY)  on  26  March  2020,  which  includes a \n\u20b91.7 trillion  ($23  billion  or  about  0.8%  of  GDP)  package  to  provide  immediate  social  security \nbenefits to the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including women affected due to the \nlockdown.  It  consists  of  (i)  providing  free  health  insurance  for  all  levels  of  health  workers  and \nproviding funds for health-related expenditures (estimated at $3.3 billion); (ii) measures to provide \nsocial  assistance  for  compensating  economic  loss  to  vulnerable  populations,  including  cash \ntransfers to farmers, women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities, and free food and gas \ndistribution for the poor (estimated at $15.0 billion);39 and (iii) social security measures for affected \nworkers in both the formal and informal sectors, including the government\u2019s contribution to the \nemployers\u2019 share of contributions to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund for 3 months benefiting small \nbusinesses, and allowing employees to withdraw up to 75% of their Employees\u2019 Provident Fund \nbalance or 3-month salary whichever is less (estimated at $4.8 billion).  \n \n\n3. \n\nMacroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability  \n\n \n23. \nSound  macroeconomic  management.  India\u2019s  macroeconomic  framework  is  broadly \nstrong with robust performance before the shock. India\u2019 annual GDP growth averaged 7.0% over \nFY2010\u2013FY2019. It was the world\u2019s fastest growing large economy during 2014-2018 supported \nby  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  economic  development  policies  that  have \ncontributed  to  substantial  reduction  in  poverty.  Significant  reforms  have  been  undertaken  for \nimproved accountability and transparency, public service delivery, social and financial inclusion, \n100%  rural  electrification,  ambitious  infrastructure  development,  and  improving  business \nenvironment. India\u2019s place in the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking has improved from \n\n \n\n38   The World Bank will support this project with $1 billion under its COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response \n\nProject approved in April 2020.  \n\n39  The pro-poor program will provide additional benefits to existing beneficiaries which are registered under each sub-\nprogram. These are categorized as the economically weakest section of the population and are most affected. The \nprogram will provide additional amount on top of the existing benefits. The attached TA will support the government \nin  identifying  COVID-19  induced  new  beneficiaries  which  comprises  of  economically  vulnerable  section  of  the \npopulation. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f130 in 2016 to 63 in 2019.  Savings and investment rates have been strong, and inflation has \nbeen declining. Consumer price index-based inflation decreased from 12% in FY2010 to 4.7% in \nFY2020  and  was  within  the  RBI\u2019s  target  range  of  2%  to  6%  during  FY2015-FY2020.40 India\u2019s \nmedium-term fiscal framework, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM), \nhas been in place since 2003 and was amended in 2018 to set the central government target of \na fiscal deficit of 3.0% of GDP by FY2020 and a debt to-GDP ratio of 40% by FY2024.41 Apart \nfrom  some  weaknesses  in  the  financial  sector  from  impaired  balance  sheets  and  recent \nweakening  of  the  Indian  rupee,  the  macroeconomic  outlook  before  the  pandemic  shock  was \npositive. \n \n24. \nDebt sustainability. IMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s \ndebt as likely sustainable due a favorable growth-interest rate differential. The public debt to GDP \nratio was 72.2% in FY2020. ADB\u2019s own assessment indicates that the public debt-to-GDP ratio \nwill remain elevated at 77.2% in FY2021 and 77.4% in FY2022 but will fall gradually to 73.5% by \nFY2025.  The  debt  path  under  the  ADB  baseline  is  about  8  percentage  points  above  the  IMF \nprojections from the Article IV report, because of not only the adverse impact of COVID-19 on \ngrowth and the general government primary balance but also the revisions to national account \ndata released in January 2020. Various stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the risks to \nIndia\u2019s debt sustainability remain contained. The additional borrowing under the ADB\u2019s CARES \nProgram, proposed MSME finance project loan, and infrastructure finance project loan ($2 billion \ncombined), the World Bank\u2019s COVID-19 assistance ($2 billion combined), and $500 million each \nfrom  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  (AIIB)  and  New  Development  Bank  (NDB)  will \nincrease the public debt to GDP ratio by about 0.2 percentage points from the ADB baseline in \nthe first two years, peaking at 77.5% in FY2022, and gradually converge to the baseline to be 0.1 \npercentage points higher by FY2025 as amortization increases. \n \n25. \nCoordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB has closely coordinated with IMF to obtain its assessment of the macroeconomic situation \nand COVID-19 impact on the Indian economy, which has been received on 16 April 2020. ADB \nis in close contact with other development financing agencies, both bilateral and multilateral, to \ncoordinate and collaborate on respective pandemic crisis responses. ADB has consulted with the \nWorld Bank to align the attached TA with its under-process $1 billion PMGKY support program. \nADB  has  also  consulted  with  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD), German development cooperation through KfW, and Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  for  complementing efforts  (para.  35)  The  United  States Center for \nDisease  Control  provided  grant  assistance \nf\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)is supporting training of health care workers and providing \nPPE for vulnerable workers such as street cleaners.

The  outputs  are: (i)  COVID-19 response \nand  health  system  measures  implemented;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  social  assistance  for \ncompensating  the  economic  loss  to  vulnerable  groups  enhanced;  and  (iii)  social  security \nmeasures  enhanced  for  affected  workers  in  both  the  formal  and  informal  sectors,  such  as \nconstruction workers. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has been actively involved in policy dialogue on the economic \nimpact of and response to COVID-19 by joining meetings chaired by Department of Economic \nAffairs (DEA) and providing recommendations that enhanced the government response actions \nand leading to the specific request for ADB\u2019s Countercyclical Support Facility and other programs \nbeing prepared. As an immediate support to India, ADB has provided $500,000 grant for thermal \nscanners  from  its  regional  TA  and  supported  successful  e-learning  modules  for  COVID-19 \ntrainings for health workers. 43,44  \n \n28. \nDuring  the  policy  dialogue  and through  consultations  with  relevant  agencies  and think-\ntanks,  ADB  has  also  identified  areas  to  further  strengthen  the  outreach  and  effectiveness  of \nexisting  programs  under  the  health  sector  response  and  PMGKY  (footnote  37).  These  will  be \nexplored  for  further  support  under  the  attached  TA  during  implementation  (para.  38).  More \nspecifically  for  the  PMGKY,  the  TA  will  support  the  government  in  developing  the  operational \nframework  and  strengthening  the  efficiency  of  the  targeting,  delivery  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the health sector interventions and select schemes under the PMGKY. The TA will \nalso aim at building and/or strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems for the PMGKY at \nthe  central  level  and  technology  platforms  and/or  digital  systems  for  select  sub-schemes,  for \nefficient  targeting  of  the  existing  beneficiaries  and  COVID-19  induced  new  beneficiaries.  ADB \nmonitoring  will  include  enhanced  focus  of  the  program  on  poor  and  vulnerable  population \nincluding  women,  by  ensuring  that  program  results  are  disaggregated  by  gender  equality  and \nsocial  inclusion  indicators  as  agreed  by the  government.  The  TA  will  provide  valuable insights \nand structured inputs to the program implementation, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate \nfurther  policy  dialogues  with  the  government,  helping  other  development  partners  who  are \nproviding  financing  to  PMGKY.  Another  ongoing  ADB  TA  will  support  MOHFW  in  COVID-19 \nresponse and ensure lessons learned from COVID-19 response are incorporated in the upcoming \nhealth sector interventions.45  An existing regional TA will also support measures against COVID-\n19 in South Asian countries including India.46 The regional TA on COVID-19 will support high level \npolicy  dialogues  and  possible  operations  focusing  on  preparedness  of  health  systems  against \nCOVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases in Asia and the Pacific, including India (footnote 43).  \n\n \n\n43  ADB. 2020.

ADB is also providing TA for \nthe Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) a pro-poor pubic health insurance scheme. ADB \nis  undertaking  assessments  in  selected  states  to  explore  a  comprehensive  health  system \nstrengthening program.47 ADB is also developing an ADB Health Sector Strategy for increased \nengagement  in  India  to  support  the  achievement  of  universal  health  coverage.  The  proposed \ninterventions  will  include  measures  to  strengthen  health  systems\u2019  resilience  against  health \nemergencies and pandemics.  \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  has  engaged  actively  in  the  COVID-19 \nresponse through (i) investments in trade finance, supply chain, microfinance, health care, and \nother industries; (ii) dialogues with industry representatives and associations (including partners \nof ADB industrial corridor programs) on recovery requirements; and (iii) collaboration as \u201cOneADB\u201d \nin formulating MSME and health care programs through sovereign and nonsovereign windows.  \n \n31. \nADB has partnered with India on public financial management (PFM) reforms, both at the \nnational and subnational levels.48 Besides creating fiscal space, an important area of ADB support \nhas been operational efficiency improvement, with the adoption of information technology-based \nplatforms  such  as  the  integrated  financial  management  system.  ADB  has  also  provided  policy \nadvisory and knowledge support to the government, including recently completed studies for the \nFRBM Review Committee (2017) and the Fifteenth Finance Commission (2019).49  \n \n32. \nIn  the  medium-term,  ADB  will  support  the  government  to  (i)  strengthen  public  health \nemergency contingency planning, (ii) improve surveillance through strengthening the Integrated \nDisease Surveillance Program platform,50 (iii) strengthen institutions in infectious disease control, \n(iv)  strengthen  comprehensive  primary  health  care,  (v)  improve  the  operational  robustness  of \nhealth  insurance  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  population,  and  (vi)  strengthen  comprehensive \nhealth care system in selected states.51 ADB will also support the government to formulate and \nimplement an overall macroeconomic framework, in coordination with other development partners \nincluding the World Bank, to (i) stimulate the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained, \n(ii)  build  capacity  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  government  programs,  and  (iii)  improve \neconomic  resilience  against  future  shocks  by  promoting  structural  adjustments  including \nimproving fiscal governance and public service delivery in state governments. These are in line \nwith and support the government\u2019s overarching goal to become a $5 trillion economy by FY2025. \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Program \n\n \n\n47  This support will start with Maharashtra and possibly extend to other states in the future.  \n48  Recent ADB support for PFM reforms in India includes programs in Punjab and West Bengal targeting fiscal space \ncreation for development expenditure with measures for revenue augmentation and expenditure rationalization. \n49  The  study  for  the  FRBM  Review  Committee  examined  the  international  experience  with  rule-based  fiscal \nmanagement and suggested recommendations for addressing the limitations. The study for the Fifteenth Finance \nCommission drew lessons from Asian countries to recommend improvements to the unconditional transfer scheme \nand examined the role of performance transfers to incentivize improved service delivery in health and education. \n50  The national health platform will be a key element of any regional health information sharing platform as proposed \nin  the  SAARC  joint  response  plan.  Regional  aspects  will  be  supported  by  TA  9231-REG:  Regional  Project \nDevelopment Support for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025. \n\n51  ADB\u2019s past and proposed health sector operations in India (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2).  \n\n \n\n\f \n33. \nThe  ADB  CARES  Program  will  contribute  directly  to  the  immediate  priorities  in \ngovernment\u2019s response to the pandemic\u2014the need to improve access to health facilities and care, \nand  protect  the  weakest  economic  section  of  the  population  and  disadvantaged  groups.  It  will \ncontribute to the government\u2019s efforts in containing COVID-19 and treating infected people, for \nfree, thus protecting the lives of the poor and vulnerable and preventing them from falling deeper \ninto poverty because of medical expenses. The program also targets providing social assistance \nand protection over 3 months to more than 800 million people, including families below the poverty \nline,  farmers,  health care workers,  women,  women\u2019s  self-help groups,  widows,  senior  citizens, \npeople with disabilities, low wage earners, and construction workers. Beneficiaries will be reached \nthrough established channels under the PMGKY scheme. Food, gas, and cash for the affected \nand vulnerable beneficiaries will help them endure the shocks induced by the lockdown. Support \nin these areas will help a quicker economic recovery when the lockdown is eased. Any further \nfiscal stimulus will be sub-optimal if these urgent concerns are not addressed. The numbers of \nbeneficiaries are detailed in the government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program (footnote 37). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nAs growth falters because of the impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s fiscal position will \nworsen  in  FY2021  from  the  budgeted  3.5%  of  GDP.  The  financing  requirement  of  the  central \ngovernment  is  expected  to  reach  $133.1  billion,  with  the  financing  gap  caused  by  COVID-19 \nestimated  at  $25.9  billion.52 Like  other  countries,  India  may  extend  the  lockdown  to  flatten  the \ncurve.  This  will  create  tremendous  pressure  on  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  space  to  mitigate \nsocioeconomic fallout. The financing requirement is expected to increase drastically from April to \nSeptember 2020, while government revenues will decline (para. 14). The longer the lockdown, \nthe more difficult the recovery process. Therefore, the current financing requirement is deemed \nconservative. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n \n\nThe central government aims to borrow \u20b94.88 trillion ($65 billion) over the first 6 months \n35. \nof FY2021 (April to September) through dated domestic securities\u2014nearly 63% of its pre-COVID-\n19 annual borrowing plan.53 Since early March, yields on 10-year government bonds have risen \nwhile  the  yield  spread  between  10-year  government  bonds  and  3-month  treasury  bills  has \nwidened, indicating much tighter liquidity conditions (para. 13). Additional government borrowing \nwill put further pressure on long-term interest rates. This will not only crowd out private investment, \nwhich is critical to post-pandemic recovery, but also increase future interest payments on public \ndebt,  which  is more than  70%  of GDP.  Timely and low-cost financial  assistance in  convertible \ncurrencies  from  development  partners  will  help  alleviate  the  pressure  on  domestic  financial \nconditions  and  support  the  Indian  rupee,  as  foreign  capital  flows  out.  In  recognition  of  these \nchallenges  and  the  need  for  an  immediate  response  to  COVID-19  with  a  strong  monitoring \nframework, the World Bank has sanctioned $1.0 billion while additional financing for around $4.0 \nbillion  is  under  consideration  by  the  World  Bank,  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  New \nDevelopment Bank, and including  (i) ADB CARES Program, and (ii) ADB\u2019s additional support \nMSMEs\u2019  and  infrastructure  financing  (Table  3).  The  government  is  considering  additional \nfinancing from JICA, AFD, and KfW to ease pressure on the domestic markets. \n \n\nFinancing Requirement and Source \n\nTable 3:  Urgent Financing Needs and Support for Fiscal Year 2021 ($ Billion) \nFY2021  \n(adjusted for COVID-19) \n\nFY2021  \n(before COVID-19) \n\n52  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n53   NDTV Profit. 2020.

The implementing agencies include (i) Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public \nDistribution; (ii) Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer\u2019s Welfare; (iii) Ministry of Rural Development; \n(iv) Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; (v) Ministry of Labour and Employment; (vi) MOHFW; \n(vii) Department of Financial Services; (viii) Department of Expenditure; and other line ministries \nand agencies as may become necessary to be included. The empowered interministerial group \nestablished  under  the  Disaster  Management  Act,  2005  on  economic  and  welfare  measures, \nchaired  by  Secretary,  DEA  and  including  MOHFW,  will  oversee  the  CARES  Program \nimplementation, under the guidance of the COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force headed \nby the Finance Minister. Director (ADB), DEA will act as the program director. The DEA will submit \nto ADB monthly  reports for  the  first  3 months and  quarterly  reports  thereafter  on  expenditures \nmade from the central government budget to support the countercyclical measures.54 The DEA \nwill also provide quarterly progress reports on the health intervention indicators, with the inputs \nfrom MOHFW and other relevant agencies. The program implementation period is April 2020 to \nJune  2021.  The  full  amount  of  $1.5  billion  will  be  disbursed  upon  the  loan  effectiveness. The \nproceeds  of  the  CARES  Program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed agreements between \nADB and the Borrower.  \n\n54  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n38. \nTo  support  the  effective  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19  Response \nProgram, ADB will provide grant-based transaction TA.55 The TA will support the government in \nmonitoring and evaluation, and in building the capacity of selected implementing agencies. Since \nthe government\u2019s pro-poor package is very large with a wide range of schemes implemented by \nmultiple  implementing  agencies,  ADB\u2019s  focus  will  be  on  specific  schemes  that  are  considered \nmost effective in reaching out to the poor and vulnerable to leverage the limited ADB resources. \nThe DEA will be the executing agency for the TA. The implementing agencies will be MOHFW \n(for output 4) and the Department of Financial Services, MOF and relevant agencies involved with \nPMGKY pro-poor programs implementation (for the rest of the outputs). The TA is estimated to \ncost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-Others). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office, administrative and logistics support and other in-kind contributions. The TA will be \nimplemented  from  April  2020  to  April  2022.  The  TA  outputs  are  (i)  capacity  and  tools  for  the \nPMGKY  pro-poor  programs\u2019  efficient  targeting  and  implementation  developed;  (ii)  the  capacity \nand systems of selected PMGKY implementing agencies in program monitoring and evaluation \nincreased;  (iii)  reforms  for  strengthening  economic  resilience  identified,  including  follow-on \nmacroeconomic  measures;  and  (iv)  the  health  system\u2019s  capacity  for  COVID-19  response \nstrengthened.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nGovernance. The PFM system in India has (i) a well-organized and systematic approach \n39. \nto budget formulation; (ii) a high level of fiscal transparency; (iii) comprehensive recording and \nmanagement of cash balances, debt, and guarantees by the government; and (iv) timely external \naudits by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.56 However, the 2010 Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability (PEFA) report as well as other assessments carried out for recent \nADB operations noted that strengthening is still required in some areas such as: (i) effectiveness \nof internal controls for non-salary expenditures, (ii) effectiveness of internal audit; and (iii) scope, \nnature  and  follow-up  of  and  legislative  scrutiny  of  external  audit  reports.57 Despite  the  mostly \nrobust country PFM systems and practices, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u2013\n2022, states that the project implementing entities\u2019 capacity to handle multidisciplinary tasks on \ninterdepartmental  coordination  and  governance,  in  terms  of  compliance  and  enforcement  in \nproject operations, are matters of potential concern.58 \nTo strengthen the PFM systems, the government has undertaken several reforms recently, \n40. \nincluding (i) rolling out a comprehensive PFM system for digitally monitoring fund flows to states \nand executing agencies; (ii) implementing direct benefit transfers and digitization of government \naccounts;  (iii)  implementing  an  expenditure  management  system;  (iv)  creating  a  Public  Debt \nManagement Cell, to delink debt and cash management from monetary policy management; and \n\n \n\n55   Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n56   According  to  the  most  recent  available  PEFA  assessment  conducted  in  2010,  India  has  relatively  strong  PFM \nsystems  in  place.  The  overall  score  for  India  (2.75)  with  a  medium  fiduciary  risk,  was  relatively  high  in  an \ninternational  context,  given  that  the  worldwide  average  PEFA  overall  score  for  57  countries  was  2.33  and  the \naverage for lower-middle-income economies was 2.41 in 2019. \n\n57  ADB. 2014.

A wide range of measures \nhave been undertaken for improving transparency. These include (i) Right to Information Act 2005, \n(ii) use of Jan Dhan\u2013Aadhaar\u2013Mobile trinity strategy, wherein Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar \ncards  (biometric  identification  cards),  and  mobile  numbers  have  been  linked  to  provide  direct \nbenefit  transfers  to  beneficiaries;  (iii)  digitization  of  a  wide  range  of  public  services;  (iv) \nstrengthening systems for allocating scarce resources through competitive auctions; (v) adoption \nof  e-procurement  system;  and  (vi)  mandating  the  use  of  the  government  e-marketplace.  The \nPrevention  of  Corruption  Act  1988  (amended  in 2013), the  Benami  Transactions  (Prohibitions) \nAct, 1988 (amended in 2016), and the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act 2013 (amended in 2016), have \nbeen amended for more effective corruption control. \n \n41. \nGiven  the  constraints  in  internal  controls  in  line  ministries  and  state  governments  on \nexpenditure  management,  lack  of  effective  internal  audit  units,  and  limited capacity to  conduct \nemergency  procurement  in  certain  states  and/or  union  territories,  the  program  pre-mitigation \nfiduciary  risks  are  considered  moderate.  As  mitigating  measures,  (i)  a  strong  daily  monitoring \nsystem  has  been  established  under  the  PMGKY,  (ii)  the  finance  minister-led  task  force  will \nundertake  overall  monitoring,  and (iii)  financial  assistance  will  go  through budgetary channels. \nOther development partners supporting the PMGKY will also provide monitoring and evaluation \noversight. Moreover, the Jan Dhan bank accounts opened for the poor and unbanked, and linked \nwith  biometric  identification,  will  be  used  under  the  program  for  direct  benefit  transfer  to \nbeneficiary  bank  accounts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government.  \n \n42. \nPoverty  and  social.  Although India\u2019s  poverty rate declined significantly, from  45.3%  in \nFY1994  to  21.9%  in  FY2012,  poverty  remains  a  concern  (para.  11).  In  addition  to  the  high \nvulnerability of the poor to public health risks such as COVID-19, the pandemic is likely to have \nfar-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes and working poverty in India (para. 12). India has \nmany workers in the informal sector, and inter- and intra-state migrant workers. Most do not have \naccess  to  pensions,  sick  leave,  paid  leave,  or  any  kind  of  insurance.  Many  do  not  have  bank \naccounts and rely on daily cash wages to meet their needs. Current lockdown measures in India, \nwhich  are  at  the  high  end  of  the  University  of  Oxford\u2019s  COVID-19  Government  Response \nStringency  Index,  have  impacted  these  workers  significantly\u2014leaving  large  numbers  with  no \nviable means of income and forcing many to return to rural areas.59 The program will reach out to \nmore than 800 million people for meeting essential needs, and minimize the adverse effects of \nthe COVID-19 crisis on the poor, especially those working in the informal economy, more than \nhalf of whom are women.  \n \n43. \nGender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Pandemics  are \nknown to worsen all inequalities. Despite progress in some areas since 2012, gender inequalities \nremain pervasive in India in terms of access to health, lower labor force participation, and time \npoverty because of dependency on traditional biomass fuel for cooking.60 Female health workers \nconstitute  almost  half  of  the  qualified  health  workforce,  accounting  for  88.9%  of  nurses  and \nmidwives.61 The  government  has  also  deployed  accredited  social  health  activists  (ASHAs)  for \ncommunity  surveillance and  monitoring  of  COVID-19.  ASHAs  are  women  from  the  community \nwho are trained to work as an interface between the community and the public health system. \n\n \n59  University of Oxford.

Adverse impact \nof exogenous \nshocks  \n\n2. Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\n3. Pre-shock record \n\nof generally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nWhile the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) has slashed the fiscal year (FY)2021 \neconomic growth forecast for India to 1.9%\u2013 down by more than 3.9 percentage \npoints over its January 2020 forecast, recent ADB estimates show that the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth could fall to 1.4% under longer containment with \na  projected  104  million  at  risk  to  fall  below  $3.2/day  poverty.1 Gross  financing \nrequirement  has  significantly  increased  due  to  the  crisis.  Government\u2019s  large \ndomestic  borrowing  is  likely  to  crowd  out  the  private  sector  and  raise  interest \ncosts. The financial sector stress will also be pronounced against the backdrop of \nrecent episodes of stressed balance sheets across some banks and non-banking \nfinancial  institutions  and  given  the  cash  flow  problems  faced  by  liquidity \nconstrained micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).  \nThe  government\u2019s  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  response  program \nincludes  (i)  a  $23  billion  pro-poor  relief  package  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nWelfare Scheme for the Poor (PMGKY) that includes social protection measures \ntargeting  the  poor,  vulnerable  population  and  disadvantaged  groups  including \nwomen. Significantly, 65% of this package is in the form of direct social assistance \nand protection to the poor, and vulnerable, including women; and (ii) a $2 billion \nhealth sector expenditure program has also been launched. \n \nIn addition to this, various state governments have also initiated countercyclical \nmeasures. \nThe fundamentals of the economy have remained strong.  India was among the \nfastest growing economies of the world with an average annual GDP growth rate \nof 7.0% during FY2010\u2013FY2019. Public debt to GDP ratio has declined over the \npast  decade  while  the  government  is  putting  serious  efforts  on  fiscal  deficit \ntargeting  under  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act  2003 \n(amended in 2018).  The government has rolled out a series of structural reforms, \nincluding introduction of goods and services tax, and lowering of corporate taxes \nto boost investment. Although issues related to stressed banking sector balance \nsheets  remain,  prompt  action  by  the  central  bank  has  lowered  macro-financial \nrisks from the banking sector. Government has consolidated public sector banks \nand  injected  substantial  capital  for  their  strengthening.  Consumer  price  index \n(CPI)-based  inflation  has  been  within  the  target  range  of  4%  to  6%  during \nFY2015\u2013FY2020.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  are  enough  to  finance  about  12 \nmonths of imports. India\u2019s external position is largely consistent with fundamentals \nand desirable policy setting.2 The pro-poor relief package is conducted within a \nsound budgetary framework.  The other reforms undertaken are as follows: \n1.  Accountability and Transparency \n\na.  Right to Information Act, 2005 \nb.  Performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  monitor  the \n\nperformance of all government schemes \n\nc.  E-procurement reforms \n\n2.  Doing Business \n\na.

Debt sustainability \n\n4. Structural reforms  The government has acted swiftly to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate \neconomic, social, and health impact. The government has set up 11 Empowered \nGroups  to  identify  problem  areas  and  ensure  proper  planning  and  coordination \nacross ministries for time-bound implementation of COVID-19 programs.3 Further, \na  COVID-19  Economic  Response  Task  Force  has  been  set  up  under  the \nleadership of the Finance Minister to undertake fiscal and monetary measures in \ncoordination with the Reserve Bank of India. \nIMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s debt as likely \nsustainable  due  to  a  favorable  growth-interest  rate  differential.  ADB\u2019s  own \nassessment indicates that the public debt to GDP ratio will increase from 72.2% \nin  FY2020  to  77.2%  in  FY2021,  and  further  to  77.4%  in  FY2022  but  will  fall \ngradually to 73.5% by FY2025. The debt path under the ADB baseline is about 8 \npercentage points above the IMF projections from the Article IV report, because \nof  not  only  the  adverse  impact  of  COVID-19  on  growth  and  the  general \ngovernment  primary  balance  but  also  the  revisions  to  national  account  data \nreleased in January 2020. Various stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the \nrisks  to  India\u2019s  debt  sustainability  remain  contained.  The  additional  borrowing \nunder the ADB\u2019s CARES Program, MSME finance project loan, and infrastructure \nfinance project loan ($2 billion), the World Bank\u2019s COVID-19 assistance ($2 billion \ncombined), and $500 million each from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \nand New Development Bank will increase the public debt to GDP ratio by about \n0.2  percentage  points  from  the  ADB  baseline  in  the  first  two  years,  peaking  at \n77.5% in FY2022, and gradually converge to the baseline to be 0.1 percentage \npoints higher by FY2025 as amortization increases. \n \nADB  has  closely  coordinated  with  IMF  on  the  macroeconomic  situation  and \nCOVID-19 impact.
