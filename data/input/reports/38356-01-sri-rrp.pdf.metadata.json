The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement \nImpact on indigenous people  \n \nThe  long-standing  conflict  has  had  serious  consequences  for  fiscal \nstability in Sri Lanka. By drawing-down on public resources to cater to \nsecurity needs, it has constrained the efforts of the Government of Sri \nLanka  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  well-being  of  its  citizens \nthrough  sustained  investments  in  the  social  sectors  and  to  enhance \nthe  reach  and  depth  of  its  social  safety  nets.  It  has  also  adversely \nimpacted  the  public  resource  management  system,  which  has \nstruggled to emerge from a vicious cycle of a shallow resource base, \nupward  pressures  on  current  expenditures,  and  absence  of  modern \nintegrated  systems  for  revenue  and  expenditure  management.  As  a \nconsequence of the weaknesses in the public resource management \nsystem,  public  service  delivery  has  suffered  and  led  to  inter-  and \nintraregional  disparities \nincomes,  employment,  and  social \ndevelopment. The recent global economic downturn that hit Sri Lanka \nhard  has  exacerbated  these  disparities  by  reducing  revenues  that \ncould have been used for enhancing public investments in the lagging \nregions. \n \nthe  conflict-affected  regions  of  Northern  Province,  Eastern \nIn \nProvince, and some adjoining villages in North Central Province, the \nincidence  of  poverty  is  more  than  double  (37%)  of  the  national \naverage  (15%),  with  the  region  contributing  a  mere  2.9%  of  the \ncountry's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  over  2005\u20132007.  To \ncompound this, prolonged conflict has created an estimated 277,000 \nnew  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  (as  of  early  March  2010, \naccording  to  Government  estimates,  about  85,000\u201390,000  of  them \nare still to be resettled in their original places of residence). There has \nalso  been  a  deceleration  in  export  growth  (from  11.0%  in  2007  to \n6.5% in 2008), and remittances also declined sharply (from 16.6% of \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  ratio  to  GDP  in  2008  to  6.7%  in  2009).  As  a  result  of  these \nfactors, and others such as occasional natural disasters, GDP growth \ndeclined to 3.6% in 2009 as compared to 7.7% in 2006 and severely \nrestricted the growth of the industries and services sectors.  \n \nThe  deterioration  of  the  economic  situation  has  also  adversely \naffected the living conditions of the people of Sri Lanka. Growth of per \ncapita income declined to 4.9% in 2008 from 6.5% in 2006. Due to a \nrise in international prices of fuel and essential commodities, inflation \nin 2008 rose to 22.8%.  \n \n\nin \n\ninvestments \n\nreconstruction  and \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nProject Description  The project aims to ensure greater sustainability of public investments \nin Sri Lanka, particularly in the less developed regions, through more \neffective  public  resource  management.  It  seeks  to  do  so  by \nenhancing the fiscal space (i.e., availability of greater resources) as a \nresult  of  bringing  about  improved  tax  administration  and  compliance \nas  well  as  more  efficient  public  financial  management.  This  will  be \ntwo  management \nthrough  establishment  of \nlargely  attained \ninformation  systems\u2014one  related  to  revenue  and  the  other  to \nexpenditure management. \n \nThe  rationale  for  the  project  is  to  help  the  government  in  its  efforts, \nparticularly  in  a  post-conflict  environment,  to  bring  about  sustainable \nand  equitable  development,  including  providing  greater  scope  for \ninfrastructure \nincreasing \ndevelopment.  The  success  of  the  Fiscal  Management  Reform \nProgram  (FMRP),  and  the  impetus  for  fiscal  management  reforms \nthat  it  helped  create,  sets  the  proper  scene  for  a  project  that  now \nfocuses on systems and on human resource capacity development in \nthis area. \n \nThe  outcome  and  outputs  envisaged  from  this  project  are  anchored \non  three  key  assumptions:  (i)  that  this  project  will  help  create  the \nfiscal  space, \nincreased  revenue  collection  and  better \nexpenditure  management,  needed  to  allow  the  government  to \nincrease investments; (ii) that creating fiscal space is a necessary but \nnot  a  sufficient  condition  to  put  the  country  on  a  sustainable  path  of \neconomic  reforms;  and  (iii)  that  fiscal  and  governance  reforms,  and \nother associated reform measures, cannot be seen as one-off events \nthat  will  be  adequate  to  put  the  country's  economy  on  a  sustained \npath of development. These reforms need to be nurtured and carried \nover  in  successive  years,  which  is  why  this  project  carries  over  the \nreforms that were initiated under FMRP.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  greater  sustainability  of  public \ninvestments, particularly in the less developed regions of the country, \nachieved through more effective public resource management. Higher \nand more targeted public investments made as a result are expected \nto  contribute  to  the  development  of  human  resources  and  physical \ninfrastructure  thereby  attracting  private  investments,  a  key  theme  in \nthe  government's  10-year  development \n(Mahinda \nChintana).  Government  finances  are  expected  to  move  to  a  virtuous \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nframework \n\nthrough \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfrom \n\nleading \n\nresulting \n\nimproved \n\ninvestments \n\ncycle  of \nto  higher  economic  growth  and \nconsequent higher revenues through better tax collections stemming \nfrom a strengthened revenue administration system. The outcome of \nthe  project  is  enhanced  fiscal  space  for  social  and  economic \ndevelopment \ntax  administration  and \ncompliance  (as  a  result  of  better  revenue  management)  and  an \nefficient  public \nfinancial  management  system  (as  a  result  of \nintegrating  treasury  management  and  developing  human  resource \ncapacity in relevant departments).  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $60  million, \nincluding taxes and duties, financing charges, and contingencies.  \n \nThe financing plan for the proposed project consists of: \n \n(i) \n\na  loan  of  $50  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  which  will  be  provided  under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  annum,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set \nforth in the loan agreement. \n$10  million  in-kind  counterpart  funding  which  will  be  provided \nby the government.   \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \nThe project period will be from 1 May 2010 to 31 October 2013. The \nperiod of utilization will be until 30 April 2014. \n\n \nThe Ministry of Finance and Planning  \n \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established at the Ministry \nof Finance and Planning (MOFP) to assist in project implementation. \nThe PMU will be headed by a dedicated project director and assisted \nby a deputy project director. The PMU will have four cells: a revenue \nadministration  management  information  system  (RAMIS)  cell,  an \nintegrated  treasury  management  information  system  (ITMIS)  cell,  an \nadministration and accounting cell, and an information technology and \nprocurement cell\u2014with each cell having 3\u20135 staff members. The PMU \nwill also have 3\u20135 additional supporting staff. \n \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) implementing and coordinating the \nproject;  (ii)  selecting,  engaging,  and  managing  the  consultants;  (iii) \ncarrying out procurement activities; (iv) providing necessary data to the \nauditor and submitting the audited financial statements to ADB on time; \n(v)  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  project;  and  (vi)  preparing  and \nsubmitting  reports  to  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  and  ADB. \nThe  PMU  will  receive  support \ninternational  and  national \nconsultants.  \n\nfrom \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nEstimated \nCompletion Date \nand Period of \nUtilization  \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nA  PSC  will  be  established  and  chaired  by  the  secretary  to  the \nTreasury,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  and  oversee  project \nimplementation. The PSC will have quarterly meetings and also meet, \nwhen  deemed  necessary.  The  first  meeting  will  be  held  within  3 \nmonths of loan effectiveness.   \n \nProcurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement of goods and services estimated at $500,000 and above \nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding. \nNational competitive bidding procedure will be followed for goods and \nservices  between  $100,000  to  $500,000.  Shopping  method  will  be \nfollowed for procurement of goods below $100,000. \n \n\nfinancially, \n\nthe  project \n\nthe  rate  of  return  on \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nConsulting Services  Consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  selected \nand  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  expected  benefits  of  the  project  are  evident  across  multiple \ndomains:  (i) \nis \nsubstantially  higher  than  either  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \nor  the  yield  rate  on  treasury  bills  of  one  year  maturity;  (ii) \neconomically, the project will lead to more sustainable development in \nthe country as a result of increased allocations for public investments \nin social and economic infrastructure, and targeted investments in the \nless  developed  regions;  (iii)  socially,  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups \nwill  be  better  addressed  in  the  medium-  to  long-term  through,  for \nexample, consideration of gender-specific needs in the allocation and \nuse  of  public  funds,  and  of  enhanced  social  safety  nets;  and  (iv) \nfiscally, with improved budget preparation, execution, and monitoring \nresulting  through  the  integrated  treasury  system,  spending  will  be \ndistributed more evenly throughout the year, contributing to efficiency \nenhancement  in  public  spending.  More  broadly,  there  are  particular \ngovernance  benefits  of the  project since  use  of  public  resources  will \nbe  more  transparent  to  ensure  accountability  at  all  levels  of  public \nadministration  and  agencies,  including  through  the  minimization  of \nhuman intervention in revenue administration.  \n \nBeneficiaries of the project include: (i) citizens and vulnerable groups \nin  lagging  regions  that  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  increased \ninvestments as a result of the greater fiscal space, (ii) taxpayers and \nbusinesses that will benefit from reduced compliance costs of paying \ntaxes,  and  (iii)  government  officials  that  will  benefit  from  capability \ndevelopment opportunities. \n\nThere  are  some  risks  that  current  reform  measures  may  not  be \nsustained  including  due  to  (i)  capacity  constraints  in  Ministry  of \nFinance  and  Planning  (MOFP),  (ii)  procurement  delays  owing  to \ninformation  and \nprocedural  barriers, \ncommunication  technology  project  management  capability,  and  (iv) \nambitious capacity development plans. Weak fiduciary arrangements, \n\nfor  greater \n\n(iii)  need \n\n  \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nand probability of lesser focus on implementation coordination in the \npresent context could also pose risks to the project. \n \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) tailored technical assistance (TA) \nand  capacity  development  support,  (ii)  continued  consultation  with \nMOFP  and  technical  experts  on  how  to  better  target  capacity \nenhancement  measures,  (iii)  a  well-staffed  PMU  with  dedicated \ndeployment of staff, (iv) quarterly reporting arrangements to minimize \nfiduciary  risks,  and  (v)  continued  robust  policy  dialogue  with \ngovernment on the broader agenda of fiscal management\u2013and other\u2013 \nreforms. \n \nIn  addition,  the  successful  implementation  of  FMRP  has  provided  a \nfor  sustaining  and \nstrong  constituency  within \nfurthering fiscal management reforms, and there is already in place at \nMOFP  the  necessary  institutional  mechanism  to  manage  the  project \nin an effective manner. Finally, there is strong government ownership \nof  the  fiscal  management  reform  agenda  (as  evidenced  by  FMRP) \nand  continued  relevance  of  the  broad  development  vision  of  the \nMahinda  Chintana\u2013these \nthe \nthat \nenvironment for producing positive project results is sustainable. \n \nThe assumptions inherent in the project are that (i) the government's \ncommitment  to  reforms  across  the  various  sectors  will  remain \nsustained  during  the  project  implementation  period;  (ii)  the  greater \nfiscal space will result in reorientation of greater resources for social \nand  economic \nthat  will  benefit  all  regions,  and \nvulnerable groups, in particular; and (iii) resources for implementation \nof  capacity  development  plans,  and  for  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenses, will be made available to the extent needed.  \n\nfactors  provide  reassurance \n\nthe  government \n\ninfrastructure \n\nA TA project will be provided to support the PMU (i) in reengineering \nbusiness  processes  to  align  with  the  applications  for  RAMIS  and \nITMIS, (ii) in preparing the Request for Proposals for selection of the \napplication and vendor for RAMIS and ITMIS, and (iii) in adhering to \nthe  project  timelines  through  technical  backstopping  and  support  in \nthe procurement process and project implementation. The TA project \nwill mitigate the risks associated with insufficient capacity in relevant \nagencies.  \n \nThe  TA  project  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $2.4  million,  of  which \n$2.0  million  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special \nFund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan;  and  $400,000  will  come \nfrom  the  government  for  in-kind  support  for  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation,  logistical  support,  etc.  Procurement  under  the  TA \nproject  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nA  total  of  44  person-months  of  international  and  140  person-months \nof national consulting inputs will be required in the implementation of \nthe TA project.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the  project  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nContext \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nSri  Lanka  is  at  a  critical  juncture  in  its  political  and  economic  history.  The  end  of  the \narmed  conflict  in  the  country\u2019s  northern  region  in  mid-2009  and  the  presidential  election  held \nrecently,  have  created  new  opportunities  for  social  and  economic  development  that  is  more \nequitable, sustainable, and people-centered. Periods immediately following conflict often shape \nthe future of countries\u2013and Sri Lanka is currently at this point. \n \n3. \nHowever, this optimism is tempered by several pressing realities, all of which impinge on \nthe ability of the Government of Sri Lanka to respond to this historic opportunity. Until 2009, the \nlengthy conflict had seriously constrained the government\u2019s efforts to enhance the quality of life \nand well-being of its citizens through sustained investments in the social sectors and to enhance \nthe reach and depth of its social safety nets. As a consequence, the delivery of public services \nhas  not  been  as  effective  as  it  could  have  been.  A  shallow  resource  base,  weak  systems  for \npublic resource management, and, more recently, the global economic downturn that has hit Sri \nLanka hard,1 have all combined to exacerbate inter- and intraregional disparities in the country. \nTo  its  credit,  Sri  Lanka  has  fared  rather  well  in  terms  of  its  overall  achievements  in  economic \nand social development. It has maintained relatively high rates of social expenditure (during the \n1990s, it was more or less stable at 10% of the national budget) although resource allocation for \nthe social sectors has tended to vary across provinces. \n \nWhile the economy has grown at an average of 5% over the past 30 years,2 the benefits \n4. \nof economic growth have been unequally shared, with most of the industries located outside the \nconflict-affected  areas  and  thus  employment  also  concentrated  in  geographical  pockets.  From \n1996  to  2001,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  some  regions  of  the  country \n(Northern  Province  [18%],  Uva  Province  [10%],  and  Eastern  Province  [slightly  over  20%])  has \nlagged behind the rest (particularly Western Province [30%]).3 \n \n5. \nMoreover,  in  the  conflict-affected  Northern  Province,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  more \nthan double (37%) of the national average (15%), with the region contributing a mere 2.9% of \nthe country's GDP over 2005\u20132007, despite having 14% of the country's land mass, 40% of the \ncoastal belt, and 6% of the population. Prolonged conflict caused immense human suffering with \ncivilians getting internally displaced from their homes, thus creating an estimated 277,000 new \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs).4 With progress on de-mining of the affected area,5 the IDPs \n                                                 \n1  Sri Lanka\u2019s share in world exports declined from under 0.07% in 2005 to approximately 0.06% in 2009. \n2  ADB. 2008.

As  of  early  March  2010,  according  to \nGovernment estimates, about 85,000\u201390,000 IDPs are still to be resettled in their original places \nof  residence.  Access  to  basic  services  including  health,  education,  and  drinking  water  in  the \nnorth  and  east  is  inadequate  due  to  under-investments  and  poor  maintenance  of  existing \ninfrastructure.  \n \n6. \nIn  the  context  of  these  challenges,  the  government  needs  to  anchor  the  process  of \nempowerment of the people of the less developed regions in a strategic and phased approach. \nEfforts to increase investments in social and economic development can benefit from targeted \nfinancial assistance from donors and development partners, particularly to address emergency \nneeds  and  short-term  investment  requirements  in  basic  services.  However,  sustainable \ninvestments are possible only through creation of greater fiscal space by instituting a strong and \neffective public resource management system.6  \n \n7. \nStrengthening  the  public  resource  management  system,  particularly  in  a  post-conflict \nenvironment,  would  help  widen  the  fiscal  space  and  consequently  allow  for  targeted \ninvestments in social sectors for marginalized and vulnerable segments (see also Appendix 2). \nAny fiscal space enhancement at the center would provide greater resources at the disposal of \nthe  government  for  the  provinces,  thus,  proportionately  increasing  allocations  for  the  lagging \nregions.  Since  the  allocative  efficiency  of  public  resources  is  constrained  by  weak  information \ngathering  and  sharing,  and  there  is  general  lack  of  sex-disaggregated  data  for  gender-\nresponsive targeting, investments in these areas will contribute to putting in place a more robust \nand efficient public resource management regime. More importantly, addressing these systemic \nand critical issues of public resource management would help achieve the broader objectives of \nstability,  peace,  and  national  reconciliation.  By  developing  capacity  to  arrive  at  improved \ntargeting  of  social  expenditures\u2014particularly  for  the  displaced  and  vulnerable  groups\u2014a \nstronger public resource management system would help reduce regional disparities.  \n \nB. \n \nImproving  fiscal  performance  for  sustainable  public  investments.7  Budget deficits \n8. \nin Sri Lanka have historically been high, and over the past several years, have averaged 8% of \nGDP.8 Revenue collection has declined as evidenced by a decline in the tax revenue, GDP ratio \nfrom 19% in 1990 to 13.3% in 2008, partly due to the effects of the global economic crisis but \nalso due to strong tax exemption and concession regimes, which have contributed to a decline \nin revenues at an average of 0.75% per year since 2006. Meanwhile, total expenditure rose at a \nrate  of  17.1%  per  year  during  2002\u20132008.9  Subsidies  and  subsidized  lending  to  public  sector \nenterprises  have  also  bloated  expenditure  bills,  with  deficits  in  the  two  largest  public  sector \nenterprises\u2014the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  and  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation\u2014alone \namounting to 1.25% of GDP. As such, the need for greater efforts on expenditure management \nand revenue enhancement is very much in evidence. \n \n9. \nMoreover, the large number of government employees (13% of the labor force) is also \ncontributing to an ever-increasing wage bill and responsible for maintaining an upward pressure \non  recurrent  expenditure.  The  recent  additional  commitments  for  new  recruitment  (54,000  in \n2008),  the  cost  of  living  allowance  for  public  servants  of  lower  grades,  and  revision  of \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n                                                 \n6  Indeed, evidence from post-conflict rebuilding efforts elsewhere suggests that reliance on donor funding alone can \nlead  to  a  mismatch  between  evolving  needs,  public  expectations,  and  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  meet  these \nexpectations (F. Galtung, and M. Tisne. 2009. A New Phase in Post-War Reconstruction. Journal of Democracy). \n\n7  See Supplementary Appendix B for further information on the fiscal situation of Sri Lanka. \n8  IMF. 2009. Stand-By-Arrangement, Sri Lanka. Washington, DC. \n9  However,  total  expenditure  (excluding  debt  repayments)  declined  from  31.0%  to  22.6%  of  GDP  during  the  same \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nallowances  for  public  officers  attached  to  the  health  and  judicial  sectors  have  bloated  the \nsalaries  and  wage  bill  to  5.2%  of  the  GDP. 10  Some  of  these  factors  need  to  be  addressed \nthrough  broader  civil  service  reforms  aimed  at  revisiting  the  structure  of  government,  but \nimprovements  within  the  current  setup  are  possible  through  strengthening  the  public  resource \nmanagement  system  and  undertaking  business  process  reengineering  in  key  agencies. \nIntroduction  of  enabling  tools  and  processes  to  improve  the  quality  of,  and  access  to, \ninformation, timely reporting and integrated expenditure tracking systems, and improvements in \naccountability  and  transparency  of  revenue  and  expenditure  management  can  contribute  to \ncreation of greater fiscal space and improved targeting of expenditure.  \n \n10.  More recently, the budget deficit has been reduced to 7.0% in 2008 from 10.9% in 2001, \nmainly  due  to  expenditure  rationalization,  with  total  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  GDP \nreduced from 27.5% in 2001 to 23.5% in 2007. Although expenditure control is a commendable \nmeasure on its own, maintaining aggregate discipline only through curtailment of expenditure is \nnot  desirable,  as  it  adversely  impacts  capital  spending  and  expenditure  on  maintenance  of \nassets.  Although  the  government  has  committed  to  protect  levels  of  public  investments  in  the \nless developed regions in the coming years, it would prove to be a real challenge unless a two-\npronged  strategy  is  followed  for  fiscal  consolidation,  including  measures  to  enhance  revenue \ncollection and rationalize public (especially recurrent) expenditure. \n \n11. \nStrengthening  public  resource  management  for  sustainable  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. Sri Lanka is on track to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals. The \nshare of public investment in total government expenditure has increased from 19.6% in 2001 to \n25.4% in 2008 and also as a percent of GDP (increasing from 4.6% in 2002 to 6% in 2008). It \nalso  has  a  relatively  extensive  social  protection  system  comprising  employment  protection, \nsocial  security  and  pensions,  and  social  safety  net  initiatives  that  include  cash  transfer \nschemes.  Allocations  for  welfare  programs  have  also  shown  a  steady  increase,  from  $302 \nmillion  in  2006  to  $330  million  in  2009.  Notwithstanding  these  initiatives,  equity  and \nsustainability of these initiatives continue to face challenges. Access to social services and their \nquality remains an issue particularly for the rural poor whose children are more likely to suffer as \na result (footnote 2). Government revenues, of which tax revenue constitutes 85%\u201390%, have \nbeen  sufficient  for  meeting  only  61%\u201372%  of  total  expenditures  in  the  past.  This  has  caused \nconsiderable  difficulties  for  achieving  greater  equity  in  social  sector  investments,  widening  the \nscope  of  the  social  safety  net,  and  sustaining  higher  social  expenditures  and  meeting  the \nadditional need for post-conflict investments in Northern and Eastern provinces.  \n \n12. \nThe need to improve public resource management assumes greater urgency in view of \nthe fact that the period for the rebuilding and economic regeneration activity\u2014up to 2012 as per \nthe Investment Program for the North (Waddakin Wassantham) and up to 2016 for the 10-year \ndevelopment framework\u2014coincides with a period of escalated debt servicing requirements.11 To \nwithstand these fiscal pressures, the fiscal space needs to be substantially enhanced.  \n \n13. \nThree  issues  arise  from  the  analysis  of  the  political  economy  in  Sri  Lanka:  (i)  public \ninvestments need to be accelerated in order to improve economic and social infrastructure and \nensure access to public services, especially in Northern and Eastern provinces; (ii) creation of \nsufficient  fiscal  space,  through  more  efficient  public  resource  management,  is  critical  for \nfinancing  higher  public  investments  and  sustaining  the  recurrent  cost  implications  of  such \ninvestments  (as  well  as  debt  servicing  requirements  of  the  borrowings  for  such  investments); \nand  (iii)  to  maximize  the  efficiency  of  public  investments  and  ensuring  proper  utilization  by \nminimizing leakages, it is necessary to put in place systems for effective fiduciary risk mitigation.  \n\n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2008. Annual Report. Colombo. \n11 External debt servicing payments between 2010\u20132013 are estimated by the government to be $3.9 billion. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n14. \nIn  response  to  these  challenges,  the  government  has  committed  to  utilizing  2%  of  its \nannual  total  spending  on  rebuilding  the  conflict-affected  areas,  and  has  embarked  on  several \nreforms.  The  Fiscal  Management  (Responsibility)  Act  was  enacted  in  2003  requiring  the \ngovernment to reduce its overall budget deficit and debt12 in a phased manner and to improve \ntransparency  and  accountability  of  its  fiscal  operations.  Policy  measures  were  also  initiated  to \nrationalize growth in current expenditures. A Presidential Commission on Tax Reforms  has also \nbeen set up to carry out a comprehensive review of the prevailing tax system and recommend \ntax policy reforms for inclusion in the National Tax Policy (likely to be announced in 2010). The \nFiscal  Management  Reform  Program  (FMRP), 13   which  ended  in  2008,  has  facilitated \ninstitutional \nundertaking  some  of \nstrengthening,  introduction  of  basic  information  technology  (IT)-enabled  services,  and  specific \noutputs  such  as  the  implementation  of  a  single  treasury  account  and  an  electronic  tax  filing \nsystem, FMRP provides a valuable platform on which to base further reforms. \n \nC. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nthese  reform  measures.  Particularly, \n\nin  relation \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \n15. \nThe  problems  in  Sri  Lanka  are  multi-faceted  and  require  multi-track  solutions,  running \nthe gamut from enhancing coverage of social safety nets, and creating economic opportunities \nto improving access to basic services, particularly in the less developed regions. The response \nof  the  government  to  these  challenges  has  been  encouraging,  as  evidenced  by  its  four-\npronged14 approach to building a peace economy, establishment of a Presidential Task Force in \nJune 2009 to formulate a strategic framework for revitalizing the economy of the northern region, \nand  identification  of  indicative  costs  of  rebuilding  and  committing  to  protecting  social  sector \ninvestments while reducing its overall expenditures. However, the successful implementation of \nthis  strategy  is  predicated  on  substantial  improvements  in  the  public  resource  management \nsystem so as to enhance targeted social expenditures and human development.  \n \n\na. \n\nScope for Improvements in Revenue Administration \n\n \n16. \nOne  of  the  issues  currently  impairing  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  undertake  greater \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  and  social  development  is  the  decline  in  growth  of  revenue \ncollection, which has gone down from 18.3% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2008. While the 2009 budget \nexpected a revenue\u2013 the GDP ratio of 16.4%, has now been revised down to 14.9%, implying \nan  overall  revenue  shortfall  of  SLRs127  billion  compared  to  the  budget  target.  This  highlights \nthe  fact  that  increasing  national  income  sources  have  not  been  successfully  tapped  as \ngovernment  revenue  has  increased  more  slowly  than  the  tax  base  and  non-tax  sources  of \npotential  revenue,  which  could  be  due  to  policy  issues  and/or  administrative  loopholes.  The \naugmentation  of  revenues  becomes  more  imperative  in  the  face  of  large  investments  being \nchanneled for reconstruction in Northern and Eastern provinces that have recurrent cost as well \nas  debt  servicing  implications.  There  is,  therefore,  a  need  for  the  government  to  take  steps \ntowards  strengthening  revenue  administration  and  increasing  the  tax  to  GDP  ratio  (14.6%  in \n2008)  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  fiscal  stress  as  well  as  non-compliance  of  the  aggregate  fiscal \ndiscipline targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under its Stand-by Facility.  \n \n17. \nAnother  major  issue  across  the  revenue  management  departments  is  related  to  the \nunder-funding of upgradation and simplification of business processes\u2013includes mainstreaming \n\n                                                 \n12 The act mentions a GDP limit of 5% for the deficit, but so far compliance has not been achieved. \n13 ADB.  2004.

See \n\nSupplementary Appendix A for a brief discussion of the context of this approach. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nof information and communication technology (ICT) services and systems that are necessary to \nenable  more  efficient  revenue  administration. 15  The  success  of  FMRP,  which  supported  the \ninstitution of necessary ICT infrastructure in the Department of Inland Revenue (DIR), points to \nthe need for an integrated revenue administration system to run on this infrastructure backbone \nso  as  to  reduce  human  interventions  and  increase  efficiencies  and  transparency  in  revenue \ncollection (i.e., towards increasing tax\u2013GDP ratio).    \n \n\nb. \n\nInefficiencies in Public Expenditure Management \n\n \nThe rebuilding process depends on appropriate investment choices within a limited fiscal \n18. \nspace,  with  implications  for  sustainability  and  indebtedness.  These  choices  and  the  quality  of \ndecision-making  are,  in  turn,  determined  by  the  systemic  capacities  covering  availability  of \nrequisite information, skills sets, and institutional arrangements for effective oversight that feeds \nin to informed decision-making on public resource allocation. Large funds are being channeled \nby  donors  and  development  partners,  towards reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  investments \nin  Northern  and  Eastern  provinces,  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  these  and  other  public \ninvestments and to manage the associated fiduciary risks, it is critical that expenditures be well-\nplanned and that results-based monitoring and evaluation mechanisms be in place to increase \nthe  accountability  of  spending  units.  Although  development-oriented  expenditures  are \nconstrained  by  very  high  recurrent  expenditures  related  to  salaries,  pensions,  subsidies,  and \nsupport to public enterprises,16 the expected decline in defense expenditures is an opportunity \nfor the government to reorient its expenditures for, among others, investments in pro-poor and \ngender-responsive  social  and  physical  infrastructure,  and  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation \nactivities. Sectoral expenditure plans that focus clearly on outcomes could significantly increase \nthe allocative efficiencies of public expenditure.  \n \n19. \nOne  of  the  most  direct,  cost-effective,  and  sustainable  methods  of  increasing  these \nallocative  efficiencies  is  to  integrate  the  treasury  management  system.  Currently,  all  the \ndepartments  within  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning  (MOFP)  are  working  on  a  stand-alone \nbasis without adequate daily information exchange. From a comparison of the current situation \n\u201cas-is\u201d  and  \u201cbest  practice  analysis\u201d  undertaken  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the \nfollowing key issues have been identified in the treasury operations in Sri Lanka: (i) constrained \nfinancial planning and monitoring given the lack of interface between expenditure management \nand  revenue  systems;  (ii)  inadequate  integration  and  modernization  of  systems,  including \nmanual treasury operations and data transfers; (iii) isolated information technology initiatives by \nrelated  departments  with  little  consideration  being  given  for  integrated  systems;  and  (iv) \ninadequate  gender-responsive  targeting  and  allocation,  including  difficulty  in  acquiring  sex-\ndisaggregated information.17 \n \nc. \n \n\nWeak Accountability and Transparency in Resource Management \n\nThe  absence  of  effective  accountability  mechanisms  and  capacities  presents  a  major \n20. \nrisk  to  government's  rebuilding  efforts.18  In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  a  conflict,  pressure  for \nachieving  quick  wins  through  public  investments  is  high,  tending  to  override  concerns  for \n                                                 \n15 Experience  has  shown  that  focus  on  these  issues  also  helps  yield  the  desired  results.  For  example,  empirical \nestimates suggest that Indonesia's tax administration reforms since 2002 have had a strong positive impact on the \ntax  yield,  achieved  without  many  changes  in  tax  policies  (Source:  Brondolo,  J.  et  al.  2008.  Tax  Administration \nReform and Fiscal Adjustment: The Case of Indonesia. IMF Working Paper No. WP-08-129. Washington, DC).  \n\n16 Current expenditure accounted for 74.7% of total expenditure in 2008. \n17 ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for  Preparing  the  Deepening  of  Fiscal  Management  Reforms  \n  Manila. (Financed by the Japan Special Fund). \n18 For  example,  in  2008,  Sri  Lanka  ranked  92nd  out  of  180  countries  on  the  Transparency  International  Corruption \nPerception  Index  (Transparency  International,  Berlin),  while  reports  of  the  Committee  on  Public  Enterprises \npublished in 2007 estimate corruption to have cost the country SLRs150 billion.  \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\neffective public accountability and transparency and creating opportunities for rent-seeking and \npatronage that invariably gets entrenched in the system. Given that large investments are made \nin  physical  construction  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  which  rely  on  effective  and \naccountable  procurement  regulatory  regimes  as  well  as  effective  expenditure  management \nsystems, the nature and depth of the problem becomes obvious.  \n \n21. \nThe  need  for  accountability  in  the  rebuilding  process  is  closely  linked  to  addressing \ninformation  asymmetries  and  institutional  arrangements  for  accountability  in  public  resource \nmanagement. These asymmetries are rooted in outdated systems and administrative practices \n(such as the manual data transmission and treasury management system). The implications for \nthe rebuilding process and for governance and sustainable development are strong\u2013information \nasymmetries  are  often  at  the  core  of  mismanagement  and  corruption,  and  lack  of  access  to \ntimely and reliable information reduces transparency of public sector management. Particularly \nin  the  context  of  revenue  administration,  streamlined  information  flows  aid  in  informed  and \nevidence-based  decision-making.  They  also  reduce  the  risk  of  leakages  and  exercise  of  any \ndiscretionary  powers,  enable  appropriate  targeting  of  public  investments,  and  facilitate \nperformance monitoring. Moreover, access to information is a means of citizen empowerment, \nhelps  bridge  trust  deficits,  and  forms  a  key  component  of  any  strategy  for  improving \ngovernance.  Hence,  there  is  a  strong  need  to  invest  heavily  and  consistently  in  improving  the \npublic resource management information systems. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nHuman Resource Capacity Development \n\n \n22. \nCapacity constraints related to human resources in the financial management system in \nthe Sri Lanka public sector were well-documented in FMRP. For purposes of this project, issues \nrelated  to  these  constraints  include  (i)  ensuring  proper  and  effective  management  information \nsystem in revenue administration and integrated treasury operations so as to derive maximum \nbenefits  from  technology;  (ii)  developing  skills  and  knowledge  of  relevant  staff  members  and \nmanagers at MOFP to effectively use the new IT-enabled systems; (iii) ensuring proper project \nmanagement  not  only  for  FMEP  but  also  generally  for  similar  projects;  and  (iv)  ensuring  that, \ninstitutionally,  there  is  greater  awareness  of  other  aspects  of  budgeting  and  revenue  and \ntreasury, such as on how to enhance gender responsiveness in budgets. This last issue is not \ntrivial\u2014while  technology  can  address  many  technical  constraints,  its  utility  is  limited  unless \nskilled individuals can operate and manage them effectively.19  \n \n23. \nIn  order  to  bring  about  sustainable  results,  the  government  has  committed  to  develop \nneeded  capacities\u2014including  management,  leadership,  and  facilitation\u2014for  better  institutional \nand  staff  performance.  As  such,  FMEP  has  a  component  on  capacity  development  under  the \nproject  which  is  designed  to  strengthen  capacities  of  government  officials  in  the  areas  of  (i) \nenhancing  revenue  administration,  (ii)  efficient  public  expenditure  and  treasury  management, \nand (iii) related institutional strengthening and IT-enabled services and systems.20 \n \n\nLessons \n\n2. \n \n24. \nFMEP has been conceptualized in light of some important recommendations put forth by \nADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department (IED) and others on public resource management.21 \nThese  lessons  include  (i)  sound  political  economy  analysis  to  improve  project  design,  (ii) \n\n                                                 \n19 Indeed, the government's vision for strong public administration in Sri Lanka is stated as: \"an excellent, productive \n\npublic service with new technology by the Year 2010\" (http://www.pubad.gov.lk/Cha(E).pdf). \n\n20 The government itself has a focus on encouraging all ministries to create an IT culture among their staff members. \n21 ADB. 2007.

FMEP takes these conclusions into \nconsideration in its design. \n \n25. \nThere have also been several lessons learned from the application of diagnostic tools in \nrevenue  administration  and  integrated  treasury  systems  elsewhere.24  Country  experiences  in \nrevenue  administration  where  the  diagnostic  tools  were  applied  showed  that  (i)  to  the  extent \npossible,  revenue  administration  tasks  have  to  be  automated  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  continued \noperational  inefficiency  and  lax  tax  enforcement;  (ii)  adequate  access  to  reliable  computing \nfacilities  and  IT  services  is  important  for  an  effective  revenue  administration  system;  and  (iii) \ndecentralized information access to the users is important for effective revenue administration. \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\n \nOwing  to  the  magnitude  of  fiscal  governance  issues,  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  Sri  Lanka \n26. \nthrough  the  proposed  FMEP  should  be  viewed  as  part  of  a  larger  multi-development  partner \nstrategy  to  address  the  issue  of  unsustainable  budget  deficits  leading  to  constrained \ninvestments in social and physical infrastructure. Several development partners are active in Sri \nLanka in the area of fiscal governance reforms (Appendix 3).  \n \n27. \nThe  government  facilitates  development  partner  coordination  through  the  External \nResources  Department  of  the  MOFP.  There  are  also  forums  such  as  the  Government  of  Sri \nLanka  Coordination  Committee  for  Humanitarian  Assistance.  Coordination  mechanisms  and \nissues  among  donors  and  development  partners  in  Sri  Lanka  center  around  the  need  for \ncoordinating  development  support  provided  to  the  government,  particularly  in  areas  of  priority \nsuch as infrastructure development, social development, and governance. To this end, several \nnetworks and forums exist, including a Development Partners Meeting Group, Bilateral Donors \nGroup,  Donors  Peace  Support  Group,  Donors  Working  Group  on  Human  Rights,  and  Donors \nWorking Group on Mine Action.  \n \nADB will ensure close coordination with ongoing development partner activities relating \n28. \ndirectly  or  indirectly  to  improve  public  resource  management  in  Sri  Lanka  to  ensure  an \nintegrated effort towards strengthening public finances in the country.

The framework also specifies ways to enhance social \ndevelopment  through  (i)  special  strategies  for  lagging  regions,26  (ii)  nationwide  investment  to \nensure more equitable access, and (iii) village development. The government strategy focuses \non  more  equitable  growth,  and  argues  for  a  more  prominent  role  for  the  state  in  economic \ndevelopment.  \n \nFor  its  part,  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Sri  Lanka 27  for  the  period \n30. \n2009\u20132011  is  based  on  lessons  learned,  especially  on  conflict-sensitivity  and  governance \nissues in the country, and also on IED's assessment of the country's development challenges. \nConsistent  with  the  need  for  stronger  government  ownership,  ADB's  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka \nfocuses  on  two  pillars  identified  in  the  10-year  development  framework:  (i)  strengthening  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  (ii)  achieving  socially  inclusive  development.  Governance,  including \ncapacity development, private sector development, and gender mainstreaming are cross-cutting \nthemes in ADB's strategy for the country.28 \n \n31.  While the CPS was prepared against the background of the conflict, it built upon ADB's \nexperience of operating in the country's conflict-affected areas. Support to areas affected by the \nconflict  is,  therefore,  also  an  important  dimension  of  the  CPS;  this  includes  the:  (i)  continued \nimplementation, wherever possible, of the existing pipeline of projects for the North and East; (ii) \ndesign of new projects for conflict-affected areas (and adjacent areas and provinces); and (iii) \ndevelopment of new nationwide projects with components for the North and East. Despite the \nend of the conflict, ADB's strategy in Sri Lanka is to adhere to the conflict sensitivity guidelines, \nas set out in the CPS, to ensure that ADB-supported activities do not inadvertently create social \ntensions. This proposed project, at its core, also adheres to these guidelines. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nThe impact of the project will be greater sustainability of public investments in social and \neconomic development in the country, particularly in the less developed regions of the country, \nachieved  through  more  effective  public  resource  management.  Higher and  more  targeted  pro-\npoor  and  gender-responsive  public  investments  that  result  from  effective  public  resource \nmanagement,  in  turn,  contribute  to  the  development  of  human  resources  and  physical \ninfrastructure  thereby  attracting  private  investments,  a  key  theme  in  the  government's  10-year \ndevelopment  framework.  Government  finances  are  expected  to  move  to  a  virtuous  cycle  of \ninvestments leading to higher economic growth and consequent higher revenues through better \ntax  buoyancy  which,  in  turn,  enable  the  government  to  invest  further  in  the  improvement  of \nsocial  and  physical  infrastructures.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  enhanced  fiscal  space \nresulting  from  improved  tax  administration  and  compliance  (as  a  result  of  better  revenue \nmanagement  and  enhanced  capacity  development  of  revenue  administration  officials),  and \nefficient  public  financial  management  system  (as  a  result  of  integrating  treasury  management \nand developing human resource capacity in relevant departments of MOFP).  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n26 This is defined to include Northern and Eastern provinces, plantations, Uva, and Saburagamuwa provinces. \n27 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n28 Towards  this  end,  ADB  seeks  to  ensure  that  fiduciary  risks  are  mitigated,  and  that  fiscal  sustainability  of  the \nplanned  investments  is  ensured.  In  this  regard,  FMEP  leverages  on  the  support  provided  to  the  government \nthrough the FMRP which was implemented during 2005\u20132008 (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nOutputs  \n\nB. \n \n33. \nTo  achieve  the  outcome  described  above,  the  government  has  declared  its  political \ncommitment  to  undertake  reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  its  institutional  mechanisms  for \nsustainable  fiscal  balance  and  for  establishing  systems  that  enable  more  accurate  budgeting, \nand  informed  decisions  on  allocation  and  use  of  public  resources.  29  FMEP  will  support  the \nachievement of these results by way of three outputs. \n \n\n1. \n\n Output 1: More Accountable Revenue Management   \n\n \n34. \nFMEP  will  address  the  inefficiencies  in  the  current  revenue  management  system  by \nbuilding  on  the  gains  from  reforms  initiated  under  FMRP  and  by  establishing  the  proposed \nrevenue administration management information systems (RAMIS) aimed at automating all the \nbusiness  processes  of  DIR  relating  to  tax  administration.  The  implementation  of  RAMIS  is \nexpected  to  lead  to  a  more  accountable  system  for  increasing  revenue  collection  by  enabling \naccess to timely and accurate information, tracking collections, and enabling DIR to reach out to \ntaxpayers  in  a  more  efficient  and  effective  way.  This  is  expected  to  (i)  widen  the  tax  net  and \nimprove compliance, (ii) enhance the efficiency of the revenue collection process, (iii) increase \nthe quality of work environment to generate higher productivity, (iv) enhance accountability and \ntransparency  in  internal  governance  systems  by  reducing  human  intervention  in  revenue \nadministration,  and  (v)  provide  better  service  to  taxpayers  with  a  view  to  increasing  voluntary \ncompliance. The increased revenues resulting from the implementation of RAMIS will create the \nnecessary fiscal space for the government to channel the resources towards addressing needs \nof less developed regions. \n \nThe design of RAMIS30 will include (i) facilitating operationalization of electronic filing of \n35. \nvalue-added  tax  returns  in  the  large  taxpayer  unit,  (ii)  creating  a  centralized  database  for  all \ntaxpayers with a unique identification number, (iii) facilitating web-based services for taxpayers; \n(iv)  introducing  a  risk-based  audit  module,  (v)  providing  details  on  imports  and  exports  to  DIR \nthrough  an  interface  with  the  Department  of  Customs,  (vi)  establishing  common  import  and \nexport  registration  scheme  and  value-added  tax  registration  between  DIR  and  Department  of \nCustoms for efficient revenue collection, and (vii) providing capacity development support in DIR \nand Department of Customs. \n \n36. \nThe activities under this output will include the procurement of IT products and services \nof  application  system  hardware,  software,  implementation  services,  training,  documentation, \nand  system  maintenance  support  for  a  specified  period  beyond  project  completion.  It  will  be \nhosted on the back of the IT infrastructure including local area network and wide area network \nbeing  installed  as  part  of  FMRP.  Training  will  be  provided  to  key  DIR  staff  involved  in  the \napplication  of  RAMIS  and  limited  to  (i)  the  functional  aspects  of  RAMIS,  and  (ii)  change \nmanagement due to the implementation of modified business process systems and procedures.  \n \n37. \nThe  core  functions  which  will  be  IT-enabled  after  implementation  of  RAMIS  are \nregistration,  returns,  tax  payments,  appeals,  collections,  cancellations,  directions,  clearances, \netc.  RAMIS  will  also  support  electronic  filing  of  tax  returns  and  provision  of  online  taxpayer \nservices.  FMEP  will  also  support  implementation  of  the  recommendations  coming  from  the \nPresidential  Commission  on  Tax  Reforms  related \ntax  administration  and  capacity \ndevelopment  measures.  Once  all  the  functions  of  RAMIS  are  developed  and  tested,  the \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n29 Towards this end, it has (i) set up the Presidential Commission on Tax Reforms and has committed to implement \nits  recommendations,  (ii)  initiated  modernizing  IT  infrastructure  as  a  stepping  stone  for  implementation  of  the \nRAMIS, and (iii) committed to human resource capacity development in the public sector. \n\n30 See  Supplementary  Appendix  D  for  a  brief  description  of  RAMIS  and  its  links  with  the  treasury  management \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nexpansion  of  RAMIS  to  provincial  sites  of  revenue  offices  will  be  undertaken  as  sites  are \nidentified by relative importance, infrastructure availability, and communications capability. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: More Efficient Expenditure Management  \n\n \nThe  current  expenditure  management  systems  are  marked  by  asymmetric  information \n38. \nflows  that  prevent  integrated  expenditure  management  and  provide  few  institutional  tools  for \ntracking. These deficiencies contribute to inadequate targeting of public expenditures and thus \nrequire redesign and re-engineering to enable for informed and timely decision-making on public \ninvestments.  Within  the  expenditure  management  system,  budget  preparation  and  execution, \nexpenditure monitoring, account consolidation, and cash management, etc., are closely related \nactivities  which  need  to  share  information  regularly  for  robust  financial  management. \nImplementation  of  an  integrated  treasury  management  information  system  (ITMIS)\u2014an \nintegrated  software  application  with  functionalities  catering  to  the  requirements  of  all  the \ndepartments  under  MOFP  will  (i)  lead  to  more  efficient  treasury  operations;  (ii)  enable  more \ninformed  decision-making  on  allocation  and  use  of  public  resources  by  reducing  time  lags  in, \nraising  the  accuracy  of  budget  preparation,  execution,  and  evaluation;  and  (iii)  aid  in  better \nplanning and targeting of operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures for the new assets \ncreated through public investments. \n \n39. \nThe ITMIS will cut across various functions of general treasury activities (Supplementary \nAppendix D): (i) budget preparation and commitment control (including allocations right down to \nthe  spending  unit  level  as  well  as  imposing  containment  before  commitments  are  made);  (ii) \npayment  control  (which  minimizes  risk  of  mismanagement  of  funds  at  the  end-user  point);  (iii) \ncash  flow  management  (which  ensures  that  the  government  has  liquidity  to  execute  its \npayments  and  that  the  costs  of  this  liquidity  are  as  low  as  possible);  (iv)  debt  management \n(which is closely linked to cash and asset management, particularly for short-term and national \ndebt);31 (v) fiscal planning and reporting (including, for example, online budgeting analysis with \nstandard pre-defined reports [required as per the law], variable-based and query-based reports, \netc.); and (vi) interfacing with RAMIS such that revenues are consolidated, accounted for, and \nreconciled on a more frequent basis.  \n \n40. \nOne  particular  sub-output  here  will  be  configuring  ITMIS  to  support  gender-responsive \nbudgeting using available sex-disaggregated data and targeted allocations to line ministries to \naddress identified vulnerabilities to ensure gender equity in fiscal policy-making, fiscal planning, \nand  public  expenditure.  The  ITMIS  will  also  support  better  planning  of  needs-based  O&M \nexpenditure for the assets created through the large investments. \n \n41. \nSimilar  to  RAMIS,  the  activities  under  this  output  will  include  the  procurement  of  IT \nproducts  and  services  of  application  system  hardware,  software,  implementation  services, \ntraining, documentation, and system maintenance support for a specified period beyond project \ncompletion. Existing stand-alone treasury-related systems will be integrated on the back of the \nexisting IT infrastructure. Training under this output will be provided to key implementation staff \nof various departments within MOFP directly involved in the application of ITMIS and limited to (i) \nthe  functional  aspects  of  ITMIS,  and  (ii)  change  management  due  to  the  implementation  of \nmodified or amended business processes, systems, and procedures.   \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n31 This functionality may be handled within the treasury, if necessary. This function includes streamlining of recording \nexternal  debts  by  providing  access  to  the  currently  operating  external  debt  recording  system  (to  be  achieved \nthrough an interface with ITMIS). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: More Capable Public Resource Managers  \n\n \n42. \nThe  proposed  introduction  of  RAMIS  and  ITMIS  is  a  necessary  but  not  a  sufficient \ncondition for achieving the objective of improving sustainability through creation of fiscal space \nand better public resource management. The skills and knowledge of public managers are the \nkey link in a bid to improve systemic efficiencies. Particularly for projects such as this one that \naims  to  introduce  new  business  processes  and  systems  for  improved  public  resource \nmanagement,  the  need  to  embed  capacity  development  of  human  resources  as  an  integral \ncomponent of project design assumes significance. Accordingly, capacity development of staff \nworking  at  MOFP  and  in  certain  other  agencies  under  the  purview  of  MOFP,  as  well  as  the \nWestern  Provincial  Council,  will  not  only  be  provided  comprehensive  training  on  RAMIS  and \nITMIS but they will also benefit from exposure to organizational systems and best practices in \ndifferent aspects of revenue administration in other jurisdictions.  \n \n43. \nCapacity development under FMEP will be managed through a strategic and structured \nframework  aimed  at  sustained  organizational  development  as  has  been  envisaged  under  the \ntraining  plans  prepared  by  the  government  under  FMRP.  The  beneficiary  departments  and \nagencies under external training will include the Department of Inland Revenue, Department of \nCustoms,  Department  of  Excise,  Western  Provincial  Council,  as  well  as  the  Treasury-related \ndepartments  of  MOFP  such  as  Department  of  National  Budget,  Department  of  Treasury \nOperations, Department of State Accounts, Department of External Resources, Department of \nFiscal  Policy,  Department  of  Management  Audit,  Department  of  Public  Enterprises,  and \nDepartment of Public Finance as well as the project management unit (PMU). The total number \nof  budgeted  cadre  under  these  departments  and  agencies  is  around  10,250.  A  Human \nResource  Development  Committee  (HRDC),  members  of  which  will  be  appointed  by  the \nsecretary  to  the  Treasury,  will  provide  selection  criteria  for  participants  in  external  training \ncourses, proposed curriculum, and number of participants. These, along with estimated budgets \nfor  the  courses,  will  be  finalized  in  consultations  with  ADB  during  project  implementation. \nRespective heads  of  the  departments  will  ensure  that  the  skills  of  the  trained staff  are  utilized \nappropriately. \n \n44. \nThe coverage of this output will be as follows: (i) undertake basic IT training for relevant \norganizations in advance of installation and operation of RAMIS and ITMIS; (ii) initiate advanced \nRAMIS and ITMIS training for identified revenue administration officials and public expenditure \nmanagement  officials,  as  well  as  management  information  system  users  in  MOFP  and \nprovincial  tax  and  expenditure  administration  officials;  (iii)  strengthen  institutional  links  with \ninternational  training  organizations  for  specialized  courses  in  high-skill  areas,  and  ensure  that \nexternal training courses are designed with training institutes elsewhere; (iv) ensure knowledge \nenhancement in the area of revenue administration as well as public expenditure management, \nwhich  includes  increasing  (to  the  extent  possible)  gender-analytical  capability  and  gender-\nbudgeting  awareness  and  commitment  of  government  staff  members;  and  (v)  strengthen  in-\nhouse training infrastructure for routine operational training by procuring facilities.  \n \nC. \n \n45. \nAn important feature of  FMEP, and  one that draws from lessons based on evaluations \ndone by IED, is that consideration has been given to reform phasing and sequencing in order to \nenhance the links between the policy and process reform foundations laid under FMRP. First, \nthis is evident in areas such as the legislative and regulatory reforms combined with enhanced \ninstitutional and human resource capacities, which would now move to actual implementation of \nthese  reform  initiatives  in  various  fields,  including  risk-based  tax  audits,  electronic  filing  of  tax \nreturns,  online  taxpayer  services,  unique  taxpayer  identification  number,  and  interfacing  the \n\nSpecial Features  \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nItem \n\nA. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n\nRAMIS  and  ITMIS.  All  these  measures  are  expected  to  lead  to  increased  efficiency  and \ntransparency, thus, contributing to good governance in public resource management.  \n \n46. \nSecond, FMEP is designed to take into consideration the institutional capacity limitations \nwithin the government by sequencing the outcomes of FMRP: (i) implementation of RAMIS after \nhuman  resource  capacity  development  and  strengthening  of  the  IT  infrastructure  backbone  at \nDIR, and (ii) capacity development of MOFP staff in parallel with the design, procurement, and \nimplementation  of \ntwo  advanced  software \napplications\u2014RAMIS and ITMIS. In view of the complex IT systems procurement, and to ensure \nefficient  technical  backstopping  for  customization  of  off-the-shelf  solutions,  adequate  project \nmanagement support has been envisaged in the TA project. \n \nD. \n \n47. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $60  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  (of \n$4.47 million), financing charges during implementation, and contingency (see Appendix 4 and \nSupplementary Appendix E for more details).  \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\ninvolves  adoption  of \n\nITMIS.

These are calculated at approximately 12.0% of the equipment \n\nprocurement, including training facilities and IT infrastructure under RAMIS and ITMIS. \n\nd   Recurrent  costs  (government  in-kind  financing)  cover  remuneration  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation,  equipment  operation  and  maintenance,  and  other  administrative  support  during  project \nimplementation.  \n\ne  Price  contingencies  are  computed  at  15.0%  of  management  information  system  turnkey  project  costs  and \nequipment.

A PMU will be established at MOFP to assist \nthe ministry in implementing the project. The PMU will be headed by a dedicated project director \nand assisted by a deputy project director. The PMU will have four cells, namely a RAMIS cell, an \nITMIS cell, an administration and accounting cell, and an IT and procurement cell. Each cell will \nhave 3\u20135 staff members; the same number of support staff will also be located in PMU. The PMU \nwill be responsible for (i) implementing and coordinating the project; (ii) selecting, engaging, and \nmanaging consultants; (iii) carrying out procurement activities; (iv) providing necessary data to the \nauditor  and  submitting  the  audited  financial  statement  to  ADB  on  time;  (v)  monitoring  and \nevaluating  the  project;  and  (vi)  preparing  and  submitting  all  reports,  including  quarterly  reports, \nannual reports, and project completion report to the project steering committee (PSC) and ADB. It \nwill receive support from international and national consultants.  \n \n50. \nA PSC will be established to provide policy guidance and oversee the implementation of \nthe project. The PSC will be chaired by the secretary to the Treasury and comprising heads of \nkey  departments  including  the  DIR,  Department  of  Customs,  Department  of  National  Budget, \nDepartment  of  State  Accounts,  Department  of  External  Resources,  Department  of  Treasury \nOperations,  Department  of  Public  Enterprises,  Department  of  Management  Audit,  Department \nof  Fiscal  Policy,  and  Department  of  Public  Finance.  The  chair  of  the  PSC  may  co-opt  other \nmembers as deemed necessary. The PSC will have quarterly meetings and whenever deemed \nnecessary.  The  first  meeting  will  be  held  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  project \norganizational  chart,  as  well  as  the  coordination  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the \nproject, is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Utilization and Estimated Completion Date \n\nThe project period will be from 1 May 2010 to 31 October 2013. The period of utilization \n\n \n51. \nwill be until 30 April 2014 (see Appendix 5 for the project implementation schedule). \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n52. \nThe procurement of goods and services under the loan will be in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  estimated  at  $500,000  and  above  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  National  competitive  bidding  will  be  followed  for  goods  and  services  less \nthan  $500,000,  and  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  government \nprocurement  guidelines  acceptable  to  ADB  with  clarifications  and  modifications  described  in \nSection  E  of  the  procurement  plan  in  Appendix  7.  Shopping  method  will  be  followed  for \nprocurement of goods below $100,000. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \nAll  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  shall  be  selected  in \n53. \naccordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  The  project  will  require  90  person-months  of  international  consultant  and  120  person-\nmonths  of  national  consultant  services.  International  and  national  firms  and  individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  to  provide  advanced  IT  training,  and  knowledge  enhancement \ntraining  in  various  areas  including  national  budget  execution  and  implementation,  public \nexpenditure  management,  centralized  accounting  system  management,  tax  and  customs \nadministration,  revenue  enhancement,  treasury  operation  management,  and  procurement \nmanagement. Training institutions or individual consultants will be engaged to provide capacity \ndevelopment  and  relevant  knowledge  enhancement  in  various  areas  as  mentioned  above. \nTraining  institutions  or  firms  will  be  engaged  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod and the weighting will follow the standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20.   \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \n54. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MOFP  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n55. \nFor its part, the government\u2014consistent with its own commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency\u2014has  placed  emphasis  on,  inter  alia,  Prevention  of  Money \nLaundering and Suppression of Terrorist Financing statutes which have already been enacted. \nThe government is also committed to maintain and comply with associated internal procedures \nand controls following international best practice standards.  \n \n56. \nAs part of project preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.  The  risk \nassessment  identified  a  number  of  governance  risks  that  could  impact  the  project. 32   The \n\n                                                 \n32 Issues  of  mismanagement  in  management  information  system  projects  in  revenue  administration  revolve  around \nlack  of  proper  controls  in  the  system,  personal  integrity  among  staff  members,  and  coordination  across \ndepartments  (e.g.,  J.  Gill.  2000.  A  Diagnostic  Framework  for  Revenue  Administration.  World  Bank.  Washington, \nDC). Several organizational and management tasks are recommended for addressing these systemic weaknesses, \nincluding implementation of code of ethics to define standards of expected behavior of staff members, development \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nidentified  risks  vary  but  they  can  be  managed  in  selected  departments  through  the  TA  and \ncapacity  building  support  provided  under  the  project.  The  project's  success  depends  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  continuing  strong  commitment  to  public  administration  reforms  in  general  and, \nmore  specifically,  to  successfully  counter  mismanagement  and  corruption  risks.  A  project \nwebsite will be developed to disclose information about project matters, including procurement. \nThe consultant will assist the PMU in establishing the project website. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n \n57.  MOFP  will  undertake  advance  contracting  to  speed  up  project  implementation.  It  may \nstart  the  consultant  selection  process  but  this  will  not  include  the  signing  of  contracts.  The \ngovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the ensuing project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n58. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  made  either  through  direct  payment  or \nimprest account procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government \nand ADB. An imprest account will be established for the project at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. \nThe  initial  advances  to,  and  the  ceiling  of,  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months or 10% of the total loan amount or whichever is lower. The \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. The statement of expenditures \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  under  contracts  not \nexceeding $100,000. The project's funds flow chart is attached in Appendix 6. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n59. \nThe government, acting through MOFP, will maintain separate records and accounts to \nidentify all goods and services financed by the loan proceeds. It will ensure that accounts and \nfinancial  statements  are  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. MOFP will provide ADB, not later than 6 months after \nthe  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  account,  financial  statements,  and \nauditor's  report.  The  imprest  account  and  statement-of-expenditure  records  will  be  audited \nannually, and a separate audit opinion will be provided for each of these. \n \n60. \nThe PMU will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB within one month of the end of \neach  quarter  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  guidelines. \nThe  reports  will  be  prepared  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  include  a  narrative \ndescription  of  the  following:  (i)  project  progress  during  the  relevant  period;  (ii)  changes  to  the \nimplementation schedule, if any; (iii) delays and problems encountered and the remedial actions \ntaken to resolve them; (iv) compliance with loan covenants, if any; (v) expected progress during \nthe next 6 months; (vi) the performance of the project consultants, where applicable; and (vii) a \nsummary  financial  account  for  the  project,  consisting  of  the  project\u2019s  expenditures  to  date. \nWithin 6 months of the project's physical completion, the government will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report, including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n                                                 \n\nand implementation of disciplinary rules, and ensuring vigilance in organizational matters (such as monitoring and \nanalyzing declarations of assets and income of staff members). \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n61. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  a  comprehensive  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB and the government is carried out to (i) \nexamine  the  project's  technical  performance,  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned \nprocurement  facilities,  and  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of  the  project's  objective.  Relevant \nbaseline indicators and targets have been incorporated in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). A set of PPME indicators will be further developed (including through benchmark \nsurveys,  as  needed)  during  project  inception  by  the  PMU  and  consultants  in  consultation  with \nADB. The government's existing monitoring and evaluation system will focus on measuring the \noutcome and impact of the project using the baseline dataset reflected in Appendix 1. The PMU \nwill review these targets every 3 months to determine progress and identify constraints. ADB will \nalso closely coordinate the monitoring of the status of project activities through regular reviews. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review  \n\n \nProject reviews will be undertaken on a continuing basis. ADB and the government will \n62. \njointly review the project's progress at least twice a year. A more intensive midterm review will \nbe undertaken within 24 months from loan effectiveness. These reviews will, among other things, \nassess  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  evaluate  project  scope  and  implementation \narrangements, and identify specific risks and their mitigating measures. If the reviews determine \nthat  changes  are  required  in  project  implementation,  the  government  and  ADB  will  agree  on \nmeasures, including changes in implementation arrangements.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n63. \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  TA  project  will  be  to  support  the  PMU  in  reengineering \nbusiness processes to align with the applications for RAMIS and ITMIS. It will also assist in the \npreparation of the request for proposals for selection of the application and vendor for RAMIS \nand ITMIS. The secondary objective of the TA project will be to support the PMU to adhere to \nthe  project  timelines  through  technical  backstopping  and  support  in  the  procurement  process \nand  project  implementation.  The  end  result  of  the  TA  project  is  expected  to  be  evident  in \nminimum  delays  in  communications  between  the  PSC  and  the  PMU,  minimum  variance \nbetween  the  proposed  and  actual  schedule  for  consultant  selection  and  placement,  and \nminimum delays in reporting.  \n \nThe  TA  project  support  will  be  provided  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  as-is  study  and \n64. \nfunctionality  analysis \nITMIS;  (ii) \ndevelopment  of  architecture  definition  and  design  for  RAMIS  and  ITMIS,  and  improvement  of \nICT environment from legal, regulatory, and institutional perspectives; (iii) support for selecting \nvendors  for  RAMIS  and  ITMIS;  (iv)  quality  control  ensuring  adequate  and  timely  service \ndeliverables to be met by contractors; and (v) testing, \u201cgo live\u201d, and post-implementation review \nof the capacity development of institutions and implementation officials. 33 \n \nThe  MOFP  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  project,  which  will  be  implemented \n65. \nover 3.5 years, and will run concurrently with the loan itself. It is expected to be completed by 31 \nOctober  2013.  The  consulting  services  will  be  delivered  intermittently  over  the  TA  project \nimplementation  period.  It  will  require  a  total  of  44  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  and  140  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  A  consulting  firm  and/or \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  a  combination  of  quality-based  selection  and \nindividual selection methods according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \n                                                 \n33 See Supplementary Appendix G for detailed terms of reference for all the proposed TA consultancies. \n\ninternationally  acceptable  RAMIS  and \n\nintroducing \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\namended from time to time). The selection of the consulting firm will be made under the quality-\nbased  selection  method  because  (i) the  assignment  is  complex  and  highly  specialized;  (ii)  the \noutputs  of  RAMIS  will  constitute  a  basic  pillar  of  the  government's  revenue  administration \narchitecture  to  generate  revenue,  and  is  to  be  upgraded  in  following  generations  of  reforms; \n(iii) need  for  greater  expertise  in  these  areas  which  are  still  being  piloted  pose  risks  for  the \neffective achievement of RAMIS and ITMIS tasks; and (iv) there is a risk of project failure if the \nbest consultant is not selected. \n \n66. \nThe consulting firm and/or individual consultants will prepare an inception report within 2 \nmonths  of  starting  their  services  which  will  fine-tune  and  detail  the  work  program  and  confirm \nthe time-bound outputs indicated in the design and monitoring framework. The first review report \nwill  be  submitted  at  the  end  of  6  months,  a  second  review  report  at  the  end  of  12  months, \nsubsequent  interim  reports  at  12  months  interval  after  that,  and  a  draft  final  report  including \ncomplete documentation at the end of the project period, with the submission of the final report \nat the end of the assignment after incorporation of comments of ADB and MOFP. The total cost \nof the TA project is estimated at $2.4 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan;  and  $400,000  will  be \ncontributed  by  the  government  with  in-kind  support  such  as  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and logistical support, e.g., for workshop arrangements. \n \n67.  While output 3 of the project loan aims at capacity development of relevant government \nofficials,  the  aim  of  the  TA  project  is  to  provide  technical  backstopping  to  the  government  for \ndeveloping architectural design, improving ICT environment, analyzing the software applications \nand  preparing  system  requirement  specifications  for  the  application,  assisting  the  PMU  to \nprepare  bidding  documents,  and  monitoring  and  evaluating  contract  implementation  to  ensure \nthat service delivery agreements are being met.34 \n \n68. \nThe  disbursements  under  the  TA  project  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2008,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \ndetailed cost estimates and a financing plan for the TA project are in Appendix 8. Procurement \nof  equipments  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PMU  in  consultation  with  TA  consultants  and  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended form time to time). At the \nend of the TA period, the computer and office equipment will be handed to the MOFP. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n69. \nThe expected benefits of the project will be evident not only on a narrow financial basis, \nbut also economically, socially, fiscally, and even more broadly: (i) financially, the rate of return \non the project is substantially higher than either the weighted average cost of capital or the yield \nrate  on  alternative  investments  (e.g.,  treasury  bills);35  (ii)  economically,  the  project  will  lead  to \nmore  sustainable  development  in  the  country  as  a  result  of  increasing  allocations  for  public \ninvestments  in  social  and  economic  infrastructure,  and  targeted  investments  in  the  less \n\n                                                 \n34 A  consulting  team  under  the  TA  will  ensure  that  timelines  are  being  met  and  that  there  are  no  slippages.  This \n\narrangement is an insurance against the implementation risks that have been identified in the project. \n\n35 The  project  was  subject  to  a  financial  analysis,  the  results  of  which  demonstrate  that  its  benefits  considerably \noutweigh the costs. The results were based on main financial parameters and sensitivity analysis, and on a 'with-\nwithout  project'  scenario,  using  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  calculation  on  the  net  benefits  accruing  from \nproject implementation. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrated the robustness of these results, with the project \nbeing financially viable even when the combination of changed assumptions in a worst case scenario was tested. \nComparisons  of  the  project  benefits  were  also  made  against  the  weighted  cost  of  capital  and  the  alternative \ninvestment in treasury bills of one-year maturity (Supplementary Appendix F). \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\ndeveloped regions; (iii) socially, the needs of vulnerable groups will be better addressed in the \nmedium-  to  long-term  through,  for  example,  increased  pro-poor  and  gender-responsive  social \nspending  and  the  investments  required  to  protect  the  livelihoods  of  vulnerable  populations,36 \nand enhanced social safety nets (the benefits here also cut across regions, and greater regional \nequity will enable the post-conflict situation in the country to stabilize more rapidly); (iv) fiscally, \nwith  improved  budget  preparation,  execution,  and  monitoring  resulting  from  the  integrated \ntreasury  system,  spending  will  be  distributed  more  evenly  throughout  the  year  contributing  to \nefficiency enhancement in public spending and reduction in the gap between budgeted amounts \nand  spending;  and  (v)  more  broadly,  the  governance  benefits  of  the  project  include  greater \ntransparency  in  the  use  of  public  resources  which  will  ensure  accountability  and  fiduciary  risk \nmanagement at all levels of government, including through minimization of human intervention \nin revenue administration.  \n \nIn addition, the results from improved performance monitoring and reporting systems will \n70. \nfeed  into  the  planning  and  budgeting  process.  The  Public  Accounts  Committee  of  the \nParliament will be able to use the audit results to ensure accountability of public spending and to \ncontrol irregularities. Internal and external control measures and oversight will also be easier to \nput  in  place  to  reduce  possibilities  for  mismanagement  and  corruption.  Transparency  in \nbudgeting and expenditure programs will enable citizen feedback on poor service delivery and \ncorrective actions being taken. One specific impact of such transparency will be evident in the \narticulation of gender-specific interests (largely through specific gender targeting in the budget). \nThe information systems will considerably facilitate this targeting. \n \n71. \nThe integrated treasury management system is expected to provide significant benefits \nin  managing  public  resources  more  effectively,  especially  (i)  full  integration  of  budget  and \nbudget  execution  data,  thereby  allowing  greater  financial  control;  (ii)  timely  monitoring  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s cash position; (iii) provision of adequate management reporting at various levels \nof  budget  execution;  (iv)  improvement  of  data  quality  for  preparation  and  execution  of  the \nbudget;  (v)  facilitation  of  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  and  other  financial  reports  for \nbudgeting and analysis; (vi) online information availability related to state-wide expenditure and \nrevenue; (vii) effective expenditure planning; and (viii) accurate revenue forecasting. \n \nIncreased  resource  availability  can  be  used  for  infrastructure  development  which \n72. \nenhances  employment,  social  security,  and  investor  confidence,  leading  to  increased  foreign \ninvestment thus facilitating more rapid economic growth. This will put fiscal reforms in a virtuous \ncycle  of  greater  growth  leading  to  more  revenues,  allowing  greater  investments,  and,  in  turn, \nleading to further growth. Beneficiaries of the project include (i) citizens and vulnerable groups \nin  lagging  regions  that  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  increased  investments  as  a  result  of  the \ngreater  fiscal  space;  (ii)  taxpayers  and  businesses  who  will  benefit  from  reduced  compliance \ncosts  of  paying  taxes;  and  (iii)  government  officials  that  will  benefit  from  capacity  building \nopportunities. \n \nB. \n\nProject Risks, Assumptions, and Safeguards \n\nRisks. The  project\u2019s  success  depends  on  MOFP's  continuing  strong  commitment  to \n73. \nfiscal  reforms  and  to  the  broader  governance  issues  of  transparency  and  responsiveness  in \nfiscal  matters.  Some  other  risks  are  the  (i)  need  for  greater  capacity  in  MOFP  to  procure  and \nimplement highly specialized technical applications,37 (ii) procurement delays due to inadequate \n\n                                                 \n36  A  related  benefit  here  relates  to  gender-responsive  fiscal  targeting  and  allocation  (Appendix  9).  Another  tangible \nbenefit will be reduced compliance costs to the private sector in paying taxes (according to the World Bank's Doing \nBusiness Survey 2010, Sri Lanka ranked 105th out of 183 countries in the \"paying taxes\" category). \n37 An assessment of the procurement capacity of the executing agency is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nmanagement  of  resources  and  procedural  barriers,  (iii)  reduced  focus  on  enabling  conditions \n(such as appropriate regulatory and institutional framework) for validity of electronic transaction \ndocuments, (iv) need for greater ICT project management capability, and (v) ambitious capacity \ndevelopment  plans.  Weak  fiduciary  arrangements,  and  probability  of  lesser  focus  on \nimplementation coordination in the present context, could also pose risks to the project.38 \n \n74.  Mitigation  measures.    Measures  to  mitigate  these  risks  include  (i)  TA  support  for \nvarious  facets  of  project  management;  (ii)  a  well-staffed  PMU  with  dedicated  deployment39  of \nstaff; (iii) targeted capacity development in specific areas of project focus; (iv) quarterly reporting \narrangements  to  minimize  fiduciary  risks;  (v)  development  of  a  project  website  to  disclose \ninformation  about  project  matters,  including  procurement;  and  (vi)  robust  policy  dialogue  with \nthe  government  on  the  broader  agenda  of  fiscal  management\u2013and  other\u2013reforms.  Moreover, \nthe  successful  implementation  of  FMRP  has  provided  a  strong  constituency  within  the \ngovernment  for  sustaining  and  furthering  fiscal  management  reforms,  and  MOFP  already  has \nthe  necessary  institutional  mechanism  to  manage  the  project  in  an  effective  manner.  Finally, \nthere is strong government ownership of the fiscal management reform agenda (as evidenced \nby the successful implementation of FMRP), and there is also continued relevance of the broad \ndevelopment  vision  of  the  Mahinda  Chintana.  All  these  factors  provide  assurance  that  the \nenvironment for producing positive project results is sustainable (Appendix 10). \n \nAssumptions.  The  assumptions  inherent  in  the  project  are  that  (i)  the  government's \n75. \ncommitment  to  reforms  across  the  various  sectors  will  remain  sustained  during  the  project \nimplementation  period;  (ii)  the  greater  fiscal  space  will  result  in  the  reorientation  of  greater \nresources  for  social  and  economic  infrastructure  that  will  benefit  all  regions,  and  vulnerable \ngroups, in particular; and (iii) resources for implementation of capacity development plans, and \nfor O&M expenses, will be made available to the extent needed. \n \n76. \nSafeguards.    The  project  has  been  reviewed  for  its  potential  impacts  on  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  effect  on  indigenous  peoples,  and  no  adverse  impacts  are \nexpected. The project is category C with respect to these safeguards. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and  MOFP  have  given  the \n\n \n77. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on time. \nMOFP  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  request \nand  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated \nfor  project \nimplementation.  \nThe government is fully committed to the project and will ensure that MOFP, and \nall  departments  within  MOFP  that  are  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the \nproject,  give  their  full  cooperation  to  ensure  the  smooth  implementation  of  the \nproject.  \n\nfunds \n\n(iii)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  MOFP  will  create  a  project  website  to \ndisclose information about various matters of the project, including procurement \nand training. With regard to procurement, the website will include information on \nthe list of participating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, basic details on \n\n                                                 \n38 Risks  in  management  information  system  projects  in  revenue  administration  also  revolve  around  lack  of  proper \ncontrols  in  the  system,  personal  integrity  among  staff,  and  inter-departmental  coordination  (J.  Gill.  2000.  A \nDiagnostic  Framework  for  Revenue  Administration.  World  Bank.  Washington,  DC).  See  also  Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n\n39 This implies particularly that specific consideration will be given to retaining trained project staff in the project. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods \nand  services  procured.  On  training,  the  website  will  include  information  on, \namong  other  things,  the  selection  criteria,  list  of  training,  and  list  of  external \ntraining institutions. \n\n(iv)  Within 9 months from the effective date, MOFP will develop a comprehensive set \nof indicators for the purpose of PPME, which will be submitted to ADB for review \nand  concurrence.  The  PPME  will  include  indicators  in  order  to  (a)  examine  the \nproject's  technical  performance,  (b)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned \nprocurement facilities, and (c) assess the achievement of the project's objectives. \nMOFP will be responsible for implementing the PPME and will review the targets \nevery 3 months to determine progress and identify constraints.  \nMOFP  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  staff  and  facilities  for  the  PMU  will  be \nmaintained throughout the period of project implementation.  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  MOFP  will  ensure  that  equal  opportunity  will  be  given  to  men  and  women  staff \nfrom  each  of  the  departments  within  MOFP  to  avail  the  various  training \nopportunities provided under the project and the TA. Further, MOFP will include a \nlist  of  the  training  participants  in  the  quarterly  report,  to  show  the  number  of \nwomen staff who participated in the various training programs.  \n\n(vii)  MOFP  will  ensure  that  the  government  policy  on  bonding  trained  personnel  will \nbe  firmly  applied  to  all  RAMIS  and  ITMIS  specialized  training  and  external \ntraining  recipients  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  and  continuation  of  the \nproject.   \n\n(viii)  MOFP will establish a HRDC to provide selection criteria for selecting candidates \nfor external training courses, proposed curriculum, and propose to the secretary \nto  the  Treasury  a  list  of candidates  to  receive  external  training  for  his  approval. \nWithin  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  HRDC  will  develop  the  general  selection \ncriteria, acceptable to ADB. \n\n(ix)  MOFP  will  ensure  the  maintenance  and  sustainability  of  RAMIS  and  ITMIS  by \nproviding  sufficient  funds  annually  for  their  O&M  throughout,  and  after,  the \nproject implementation period.  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n \n78. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  loan  of  $50,000,000  to  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the \nFiscal  Management  Efficiency  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;

Three decades of conflict have devastated infrastructure, resulted in \n3. \nloss of livelihood, and severely curtailed civil administration capacity. Estimates of the direct and \nindirect  economic  costs  of  the  conflict  indicate  that  it  may  have  shaved  2%  off  the  economic \ngrowth rate annually. Lack of infrastructure is a key problem, and the poor state of infrastructure \nis the direct result of both inadequate fiscal space caused by higher allocations to meet security \nneeds  and  inefficient  revenue  administration,  and  delayed  implementation  of  infrastructure \nprojects.3 \n \nSocial impact. One of the more immediate results of the conflict was that it constrained \n4. \ngovernment  efforts  to  increase  social  sector  expenditure  in  the  conflict  regions.  As  a  result, \nthese regions lag behind the others on most indicators, e.g. the incidence of poverty in Northern \nprovince  is  estimated  at  37%  compared  with  15%  for  the  country  as  a  whole,  the  region\u2019s \ncontribution to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  a  mere  2.9%  in  2005\u20132007,  and  access  to \n(and  quality  of)  basic  services  lag  behind  those  in  the  nonconflict  regions  (footnote  3).  The \nconflict  also  led  to  displacement,  adding  more  than  280,000  internally  displaced  people  to  the \nexisting number.  \n \n5. \nFiscal  impact.  Historically,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  budget  deficits  have  been  high,  averaging \napproximately  8%  of  GDP  due  to,  among  other  things,  the  costs  associated  with  the  long-\nstanding  conflict.  With  shortfalls  in  revenue  collection  since  2006,  gross  revenue  as  a \npercentage of GDP has consequently shown a declining trend (Figure A2.1).4  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  After  witnessing  average  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  6.4%  per  annum  during  2002\u20132008  and \n6.0%  in  2008,  GDP  growth  declined  sharply  in  2009\u2014in  October  2009,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nestimated Sri Lanka's GDP growth at only 3.5%. \n\n2  For purposes of this project, \"sector\" is defined as areas related to public financial management, including revenue \nadministration and expenditure management. Apart from values of efficiency and effectiveness of these systems, \nothers  that  are  discussed  with  respect  to  this  sector  include  transparency  and  accountability.

Indeed, unless the government embarks upon a path of \nsignificant adjustments as advised under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, public \ndebt as a proportion of GDP will likely increase if the current fiscal policies continue (footnote 4). \n \nB. \n \nWhile  the  country  has  made  impressive  gains  in  many  indicators  of  social  and  human \n7. \ndevelopment, there is urgent need to increase investments, particularly as the conflict has left \nthe north and east with substantial infrastructure deficiencies. The challenges for Sri Lanka are \nthus ensuring equity of public investments and achieving distributive efficiency of the economic \ngrowth achieved over the years. Social sector expenditures have varied across provinces,5 as \nhas economic growth (Figure A2.2). Not adopting equity as a guiding principle for social sector \nexpenditure would likely raise the risk of delaying improvements in the less developed regions. \n \n\nFigure A2.2: Index of Real GDP Change by Province, 1996\u20132003 (%) \n\n \n  Source: World Bank. 2006.

The  focus  on  increasing  public  investment  levels  is  critical  at  this \nstage.  The  10-year  development  framework  of  the  government,  also  known  as  the  Mahinda \nChintana, 6  places  substantial  focus  on  infrastructure  development  to  accelerate  growth  and \nnarrow regional disparities. Randora, the government\u2019s infrastructure investment plan, looks at \nmajor power, highway, and port and airport development projects. Various other programs, such \nas  Maga  Neguma,  concentrate  on  rural  infrastructure  development.  In  July  2009,  the \ngovernment  finalized  the  Wadakkil  Wasantham, 7   a  3-year  investment  program  for  Northern \nprovince (Table A1), which identifies the need for investing $2.68 billion over a 3-year period to \naddress economic and social services needs of the less-developed regions. \n \n\nTable A1: Summary of Investment Program for Northern Province, 2010\u20132012 \n \n\nSLRs million \n\n15,091 \n176,247 \n29,313 \n28,477 \n45,739 \n294,867 \n\n$ million \n137 \n1,602 \n266 \n259 \n416 \n2,680 \n\nItem \nSocial protection and livelihood development \nImproving economic infrastructure \nStrengthening social infrastructure and fostering social services \nRevitalizing productive sectors \nHuman settlements development \n           Total \nSource: Government of Sri Lanka. 2009.

With  the  end  of  the  conflict,  the  level  of \ninvestments  needed  to  effectively  implement  the  10-year  development  framework  has \nincreased. 8   In  this  regard,  the  government  has  expressed  a  strong  desire  for  development \npartners, including ADB, to assist in generating added investments. It has also put forth plans \nand  strategies  to  improve  the  macroeconomic  environment  so  as  to  strengthen  revenue \ncollection.  Given  that  more  than  half  of  the  investment  needs  under  the  framework  will  be \nfinanced  through  government  resources  and  that  during  1990\u20132006  government  revenue \nfinanced  only  between  61%  and  72%  of  total  expenditure,9  this  need  for  enhanced  revenue \ncollection is paramount. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Mahinda  Chintana  (Mahinda  Vision)  is  the  10-year  horizon  development  framework  that  provides  the  strategic \n\ndirection for development planning in Sri Lanka.  \n7  Northern Reawakening Development Program.  \n8  But so has investor confidence in the country (as evident in the performance of the Colombo Stock Exchange in \n2009\u20132010, ranking as the second best performing stock market in the world). The Economist Intelligence Unit in \nJanuary 2010 maintained that Sri Lanka ranked eighth in the top 10 fastest growing economies in the world.  \n\n9  Approximately  one-third  of  the  needed  resources  are  expected  to  be  financed  through  development  assistance, \n4%\u221220%  through  public\u2013private  partnerships  (depending  on  the  sector),  and  about  10%  from  the  private  sector. \nADB. 2008.

The  fact  remains  that  the \ndeficit  levels  have  exceeded  the  limit  of  5.0%  mentioned  in  the  Fiscal  Management \n(Responsibility)  Act  No.  3  of  2003;  however,  the  act  also  makes  provisions  for  reasons  for \ndeviation. \n \n\nGovernment Revenue  \n\nRevenue  receipts  have  hovered  around  15%\u201316%  of  GDP  because  of  the  granting  of \n11. \nduty concessions on essential commodities given high international prices and the effect of the \nglobal economic slowdown. In 2009, the revenue-GDP ratio is estimated to remain at about the \nsame  level  as  in  2008.  Tax  revenue  accounts  for  85%\u201390%  of  total  revenue,  while  nontax \nrevenue  accounts  for  10%\u201315%.  As  such,  any  reforms  taken  to  increase  tax  revenues  are \nexpected to have a substantial impact on the availability of resources for investments. The tax \nrevenue\u2013GDP  ratio  was  13.3%  in  2008\u2014its  persistent  decline  in  recent  years  reveals  that \nincreasing incomes are escaping the tax net and points to deficiencies in Sri Lanka's tax policy \nor  in  its  tax  administration  system.  In  addition,  tax  concessions  granted  by  the  Board  of \nInvestments have had an impact on lower tax revenues. \n \n\nExpenditure Analysis \n\n12.  \nThe share of current expenditure in total expenditure is high but it has declined over the \nyears  (from  78.5%  of  the  total  government  expenditure  in  2001  to  74.7%  in  2008). \nConsequently,  the  share  of  public  investment  in  total  government  expenditure  increased  from \n19.6%  in  2001  to  25.4%  in  2008.  As  a  percentage  of  GDP,  public  investment  increased  from \n4.6%  in  2002  to  6.0%  in  2008.  However,  increased  recurrent  expenditure  resulting  from  new \nrecruitment  (primarily  in  the  security  services),  higher  defense-related  expenditures,  and \nincreased  subsidies  given  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  increased  global  prices  have  exerted \npressures on available resources for public investment.   \n\n \n\nExpenditure Management  \n\n13.   High  current  and  budget  deficits  signify  that  the  government  has  been  generous  in  its \nexpenditure over the years, but also lenient with respect to expenditure ceilings and controls. It \nhas  used  expenditure  as  a  social  policy  tool  and  spent  generously  on  health,  education,  and \nother  social  services.  These  programs  have  contributed,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  country's  very \nhigh  levels  of  literacy  and  life  expectancy  relative  to  its  per  capita  income.  Subsidies  and \n\n                                                 \n10 IMF. 2009. Sri Lanka: Request for Stand-By Arrangement 2009. Washington DC.

The  share  of  grants  in  deficit  financing  has \nincreased from 5.8% in 2003 to 11.0% in 2007, and the share of loans in deficit financing has \nincreased from 86.94% in 2003 to 89.00% in 2007. The total (external and domestic) debt of the \ngovernment  increased  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  12.7%  during  2003\u20132007,  while  GDP \nincreased by 18.4% per annum during the same period. Higher economic growth, together with \nfiscal consolidation efforts, led to a declining debt\u2013GDP ratio from 102.3% in 2003 to 81.1% in \n2008. The total debt of the government increased by SLRs536 billion between 2007 and 2008, \nand the external (public and private) debt\u2013GDP ratio is estimated to have declined from 50.2% \nof GDP in 2006 to 43.5% in 2009 (although it is projected to increase to 47.3% of GDP in 2011, \naccording to International Monetary Fund estimates). Also, high budgetary deficits have, in the \npast, required high domestic borrowing, which consequently increased the debt servicing costs \nfor the government.  \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Constraints and Issues \n \n\n15.   A key issue currently impairing the country's economy is the declining growth of revenue \ncollection. The mobilization of tax revenue has been hit by the slowdown in economic activity. \nThe growth of government revenues fell from 18.3% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2008. While the 2009 \nbudget  expected  a  revenue\u2013GDP  ratio  of  16.4%,  it  has  been  revised  down  to  14.9%.  This \nimplies an overall revenue shortfall of SLRs127 billion in 2008, compared to the budget target. \nAgainst the backdrop of the global crisis, enhancing tax buoyancy, broadening the tax base, and \naddressing administrative loopholes have become all the more urgent. This issue requires an in-\ndepth analysis of revenue policy structure and the administrative set-up, and significant revenue \nreforms.  \n\n16.   Another  fiscal  constraint  being  faced  by  Sri  Lanka  is  the  increasing  volatility  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  debt  portfolio.  The  government  has  been  increasingly  turning  to  foreign \ncommercial borrowing in recent years, the share of which in total foreign debt has risen from 5% \nin 2003 to 11% in 2008. As the maturities of the commercial borrowings are relatively short, the \nrollover risk of this debt is high. In addition, given weaknesses in information sharing and other \nsystemic  constraints  that  pose  difficulties  in  effective  debt  management,  the  government \nrequires support in its debt management practices and system. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nA sustainable way to address the issues that the fiscal constraints have imposed, as well \nas  to  source  greater  investments  in  social  and  economic  infrastructure,  is  to  substantially \nrevamp the existing revenue and expenditure management systems in the country. The logic of \ndoing this is evident in Figure A2.3. \n \n\nRevenue and Expenditure Management Systems \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 2 \n\n30 \n \n \n\n \n\nThe  government\u2019s  management  of  public \n\n18. \nrevenue \nadministration  and  treasury  operations,  both  of  which  are  in  need  of  strategic  re-engineering. \nThe continuation of treasury operations in manual (or if automated, then in stand-alone) mode, \nfor  example,  creates  a  lack  of  integration  and  reduces  efficiencies.  A  revenue  management \nsystem  that  does  not  maximize  tax  compliance  also  leads  to  reduced  fiscal  space  and \nconsequently reduced availability of investments.  \n\nresources  centers  on \n\nits \n\nFigure A2.3: Fiscal Management Efficiency and Increased Investments \n\nInvestments in economic and social infrastructure \n\nIn the case of Sri Lanka such investments implies  \n\nBorrowings \n\nEfficient allocation and utilization of resources \n\nDevelopment \npartner support \n\nAll of them would have an impact on \n\n\uf0b7  Debt Service Cost \n\uf0b7  Recurrent Cost for O&M of New Infrastructure \n\uf0b7 New Investment Costs\n\nWill have long-term implications on \n\nMacroeconomic \nStability \n\nAggregate Fiscal \nDiscipline\n\nFiduciary Risk \nManagement\n\nCreation of Fiscal \nSpace \n\nAims at  \n\nHas targets for  \n\nIMF STANDBY \nFACILITY \n\nExpenditure \nConsolidation\n\nRevenue \nAugmentation\n\nIntegrated \ntreasury\n\nRevenue \nmanagement \n\nFiscal Management \nEfficiency \n\nIMF = International Monetary Fund, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nProposed Project on Fiscal Management Efficiency \n\n \nE. \n \n19. \nGiven the sector weaknesses and the need for enhancing fiscal space to better manage \nthe  revenues  and  expenditures  of  the  government,  the  Fiscal  Management  Efficiency  Project \n(FMEP) has been proposed to build on the results of the Fiscal Management Reform Program. \nThe  FMEP  is  targeted  at  (i)  improved  budgeting,  expenditure  management,  accounting,  and \nauditing through the integrated treasury management information system; (ii) increased revenue \nthrough  expansion  of  the  tax  base  and  efficiency  gains  through  strengthened  revenue \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Appendix 2        \n\n31\n\nadministration  by  implementing  the  revenue  administration  management  information  system, \nthereby addressing fiscal sustainability of reconstruction and rehabilitation investments; and (iii) \nmore  needs-responsive \ntargeting  of  budgetary  allocations. \nInterventions  under  the  FMEP  will  ultimately  lead  to  revenue  augmentation  and  expenditure \nconsolidation  resulting  in  greater  fiscal  space,  thus  enabling  the  government  to  allocate  more \nfiscal  resources  to  much-needed  social  and  economic  infrastructure  investments  in  the  less \ndeveloped regions. \n \n\nfiscal  planning \n\nfor  better \n\n \n\n\f32 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION  \n \n\nMajor Development Partners: Strategic Focuses and Key Activities \n\nA. \n \nDevelopment  partners'  support  in  Sri  Lanka  in  the  areas  of  public  sector \n1. \nmanagement, economic growth, governance, social development, and capacity development \nis being guided by the medium-term development framework of the government \u201cA 10-Year \nHorizon  Development  Framework  2006\u20132016.\"  The  World  Bank  is  a  key  development \npartner in the relevant areas of this project as is the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA)  (Table  A3.1).

Nevertheless,  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Coordination  requires  more  engaged \ndialogue,  and  cooperation  that  goes  beyond  sharing  of  information  and  moves  toward \ncollaborative and complementary plans and interventions. On this ground, there is scope for \nmore  collaboration.  Particularly  with  reference  to  the  rebuilding  efforts  in  the  conflict-hit \nregions, there is a need to ensure that development partner support is completely aligned. \nThere  appears  to  be a general  tendency  to  develop  and  implement  projects independently \nand in an uncoordinated manner. \n \nD. \n \n4. \ncan focus on the following: \n \n\nWith  respect  to  this  project,  and  given  the  coordinating  mechanisms  in  place,  ADB \n\nRecommendations \n\n(i) \n\ncontinue dialogue with other development partners (at the policy level) so that \nbroad  issues  (such  as  on  the  political  economy)  may  be  better  reflected  in \nproject implementation, as the need arises; \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n35\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthat \n\nrelated \n\nlevel  so \n\ninformation-sharing  directly \n\ncontinue  working  relationships  among  development  partners  at  the  working \ngroup \nto  project \nimplementation is strengthened; \nseek alignment with the existing and planned support from other development \npartners, for example, on any capacity development interventions that may be \nplanned to which this project's third component could be tied; \nseek greater support from the resident mission in ensuring more concentrated \nand  regular  implementation  follow-up  with  other  development  partners  and \nwith the government; and \nshow  greater  willingness  to  share  information  with  other  development \npartners on project implementation and other relevant issues. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nItem\n\nPROJECT INVESTMENT PLAN AND COST ESTIMATES \n \n\nADB\nOCR\n\nGovt\n\nTotal Project \nCost\n\n% of ADB \nFunding\n\nA.

The \nprimary  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  a  capable  project  management  unit  (PMU)  that  is  able  to \neffectively  (i)  select  the  application  and  vendor  for  the  revenue  administration  management \ninformation system (RAMIS) and integrated treasury management information system (ITMIS), \nand (ii) re-engineer the application to suit the RAMIS and ITMIS. \n \n2. \nThe  secondary  objective  of  the  TA  project  will  be  to  provide  technical  support  to  the \ngovernment in evaluating the software applications, undertake negotiations with vendors of the \nsoftware, prepare and vet the system requirement specifications for the application, and monitor \nimplementation to ensure that service delivery agreements are being met under the RAMIS and \nITMIS. \n \n3. \nThe output of the TA project will be to support effective management of the project (i.e., \nthe PMU of the project is able to fulfill its mandates better as evident in the timely completion of \nall  project-related  actions,  such  as  procurement,  disbursements,  and  reporting).  Through  the \nestablishment of the RAMIS and ITMIS, more efficient and transparent institutional management \nwill  be  set  up,  and  a  robust  institutional  arrangement  is  expected  to  follow  enabling  the \ngovernment to deliver government\u2013government, government\u2013citizen, and government\u2013business \nelectronic  services  backed  by  professional  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT) \nsupport centers with appropriately skilled staff and secure data centers. \n \nB. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe five key activities of the TA project will consist of the following: \n\nKey Activities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStudy  and  functionality  analysis  for  introducing  internally-acceptable \nRAMIS  and  ITMIS.  TA  consultants  will  review  the  study  of  the  current  revenue \nadministration and stand-alone treasury and expenditure mechanisms. Based on \nthe  study,  TA  consultants  will  develop  an \ninternally-acceptable  system \nfunctionality  to  capture  all  the  functions  for  the  RAMIS  (centralized  database \nsystem, web-based tax filing, tax audit system, etc.) and for the ITMIS (aggregate \nfiscal  planning,  annual  budget  preparation  and  allocation,  budget  and \ncommitment  control,  payment  and  payroll  control,  cash  flow  management,  debt \nmanagement,  treasury  accounting,  fiscal  reporting),  as  well  as  interfacing \nbetween  the  RAMIS  and  ITMIS  in  discussion  with  the  system  users  of  the \ngovernment. \nDevelop  architecture  definition  and  design  for  the  RAMIS  and  ITMIS  and \nimprove  ICT  environment  from  regulatory  and  institutional  perspectives. \nThe  objective  of  the  architecture  definition  and  design  is  to  identify  a  high-level \nconceptual  solution  based  on  the  configuration  of  an  enterprise  resource \nplanning  system,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  industry  standards.  TA  consultants \nwill elicit technical requirements on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and Planning \n(MOFP)  on  the  basis  of  business  process  analysis  in  the  previous  phase,  and \nlead actual preparation of all the documents including technical specification for \nthe RAMIS and ITMIS in line with all commercial off-the-shelf products available \nin the market, request for proposal, and other related bidding documents. For an \nenhanced ICT environment, TA consultants will, if necessary, assist the MOFP to \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nassess  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  of  the  ICT  environment,  and \nidentify areas for improvement.    \nSupport for selecting vendors for the RAMIS and ITMIS. The TA consultants \nwill  assist  the  PMU  to  select  short  listed  vendors,  conduct  pre-bid  meetings  to \ndiscuss  proposed  technical  specifications  in  line  with  the  planned  architectural \ndefinition  and  design,  review  all  the  submitted  proposals  under  stage  1  and \nstage 2,  assist  the  PMU  to  negotiate  all  the  financial  and  technical  conditions, \nand review the contracts with adequate vendors for installation and customization \nof the RAMIS and ITMIS.  \nQuality control ensuring adequate and timely deliverables by vendors. The \nTA  consultants  will  monitor  milestone  deliverables  and  ensure  timely  and \nadequate quality of deliverables to be provided during the implementation period. \nThe  consultants  will  be  involved  in  the  monitoring  customization  and  installing \nsoftware  and  business  process,  and  testing  of  deliverables  based  on  best \npractices  for  configuration.  Once  the  base  configuration  is  completed,  TA \nconsultants  will  assist  government  officials  in  undertaking  acceptance  tests  and \ndeveloping user manuals in consultation with contractors. The TA consultants will \nalso  provide  suggestions  for  improved  risk  management,  along  with  alternative \nactionable options for risk mitigation and effective project implementation.    \n\u201cGo  Live,\u201d  post-implementation  review,  and  capacity  development  under \nthe \nchange  management.  TA  consultants  will  supervise \ncommercial  off-the-shelf  system  to  ensure  that  all  the  data  are  migrated,  users \nare  well-trained,  reports  and  manuals  are  properly  developed,  and,  as  a  whole, \nthat the RAMIS and ITMIS are in place for business use (i.e., a proof of evidence \nstage). Once the system is opened for daily use, a support phase will commence \nand  resolution  of  the  residual  issues  will  be  coordinated  by  TA  consultants.  A \npost-implementation  review  will  be  conducted  to  assess  implemented  business \nprocess solutions after a period of live-run of the application system.  \n\nthe  rollout  of \n\nCost and Financing \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  TA  project  will  cost  the  equivalent  of  $2.4  million,  of  which  $2.0  million  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment of Sri Lanka will contribute the balance of $0.4 million through in-kind contribution \nfor PMU staff, logistics, administration, utilities, communications, and other support costs (Table \nA8.1). \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe MOFP will be the executing agency for the TA, and the PMU for the project will also \nimplement  the  TA.  The  TA  project  will  be  implemented  over  3.5  years,  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  31  October  2013.  The  TA  services  will  be  delivered  intermittently  over  the  TA \nimplementation  period,  requiring  44  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n140 person-months  of  national  consulting  services  (Table  A8.2).  A  consulting  firm  and/or \nindividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The selection of the consulting firm will be \nmade  under  the  quality-based  selection  method  because  (i) the  assignment  is  complex,  and \nhighly specialized; (ii) the outputs of the RAMIS will constitute a basic pillar of the government's \nrevenue  administration  architecture  to  generate  revenue,  and  is  to  be  upgraded  in  following \ngenerations  of  reforms;  (iii) the  need  for  greater  expertise  in  these  areas  which  are  still  being \npiloted pose risks for the effective achievement of the RAMIS and ITMIS tasks; and (iv) there is \na high risk of project failure if the best consultant is not selected. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n47\n\nReporting  arrangements. The consulting firm and/or individual consultants will submit \n7. \nthe following reports: (i) an inception report within 2 months of starting their services, (ii) the first \nreview  report  at  the  end  of  6  months,  the  second  review  report  at  the  end  of  12  months,  two \ninterim  reports  at  12-month  intervals  after  that,  and  (iii)  a  draft  final  report  including  complete \ndocumentation at the end of the project period. The final report will be submitted at the end of \nthe assignment after incorporation of comments of ADB and the government. \n\n \nTable A8.1: Technical Assistance Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n ($'000) \n \n\nItem \nA.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy 2009\u20132011 for Sri Lanka,a approved in 2008, is aligned to \nthe  government's  10-year  development  framework  2006\u20132016,  and  the  program  for  2009\u22122011  is  focused  on  the \ngovernment's  priority  areas.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  the  two  pillars  identified  in  the  framework:  (i)  strengthening  the \ninvestment climate, and (ii) achieving socially inclusive development. The first pillar deals with infrastructure development and \nhuman  resource  development  to  improve  competitiveness.  The  second  pillar  focuses  on  regional  disparities  and  looks  at \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  and  administrative  and  absorptive  capacity  in  the  poorer  regions  to  improve  the  delivery  of \npublic  services.  The  country  partnership  strategy  specifically  focuses  on  decentralizing  public  services  and  strengthening \nrevenue collection by provinces. With the end of military operations in early 2009, new priorities have emerged for Sri Lanka. \nOn the request of the government, ADB brought forward planned interventions in the north in the country operations business \nplan for 2010\u20132012,b and the 2010 pipeline is largely focused on the north.  \n \nThe Fiscal Management Efficiency Project (FMEP) has strong links to key goals in the 10-year development framework, which \nfocuses  on  infrastructure  development  to  accelerate  growth  and  narrow  regional  disparities.  Randora,  the  government\u2019s \ninfrastructure  investment  plan,  looks  at  major  power,  highway,  port,  and  airport  development  projects.  Various  other \nprograms,  such  as  Maga  Neguma,  look  at  rural  infrastructure  development.  These  programs  are  expected  to  improve \nconnectivity  of  rural  areas  to  urban  centers  and  the  global  economy,  which  is  seen  as  a  key  factor  in  revitalizing  the  rural \neconomy.  The  FMEP  aims  to  create  the  scope  for  greater  investments  by  strengthening  revenue  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement. This will result in higher public investments in physical and social infrastructure.  \n \nThe 10-year development framework looks at improving the macroeconomic environment, in part by reducing the fiscal deficit \nto 5% by 2011, through substantially higher revenue collection. Increasing the tax revenue to gross domestic product ratio as \na  result  of  efficient  revenue  administration  is  a  key  outcome  of  the  FMEP.  The  project  will  focus  on  improving  tax \nadministration by supporting broad-based management information system reforms and expenditure prioritization and efficient \nexpenditure  management  through  the  implementation  of  the  integrated  treasury  management  information  system  (ITMIS). \nThese interventions will allow greater fiscal space for infrastructure development. \n \nWith the ending of military operations in May 2009, reconstruction and development of the former conflict areas has become a \npriority for the government. While there are many post-war challenges, the government has developed the $2.68 billion 3-year \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  north,  based  on  the  experience  in  the  east,  where  major  military  operations  ended  in  2007.  The \nexpenditure rationalization envisaged under the project will support allocation of expenditure into northern reconstruction for \nlivelihood development and reconstruction of community infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nSri Lanka is on track to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty by 2015. The Head Count \nIndex  reported  in  2006\u20132007  (15.2%)  is  nearing  the  50%  mark  (13.1%)  of  26.1%  reported  in  1990\u20131991.  The  rural  sector, \nwhere 80% of the population resides, is the main contributor to the drop in national poverty and where the poverty incidence \ndropped  from  24.7%  in  2002  to  15.7%  in  2007.  However,  poverty  in  the  estate  sector,  which  holds  about  5.5%  of  the \npopulation, has increased from 30% in 2002 to 32% in 2007. A continuous drop in poverty throughout the last two decades in \nthe urban sector of Sri Lanka has been matched by the highly urbanized Western Province in  which more than 60% of the \nurban population of Sri Lanka lives. \n \nSri  Lanka  has  fared  well  in  terms  of  nonincome  poverty  indicators.  The  country  is  an  early  achiever  with  regard  to  several \nMDG  indicators  relating  to  nonincome  dimensions  of  human  development,  such  as  universal  primary  school  enrollment, \ngender parity in primary and secondary school enrollment, under-5 child mortality and infant mortality, universal provision of \nreproductive health services, decline in prevalence of tuberculosis and death rates, and increased access to safe water and \nsanitation.  However,  national  figures  mask  considerable  gender-related,  sector,  and  regional  variation  in  terms  of  these \nindicators. \n \nDifferential access to infrastructure has been the main driver of the increase in inequality and underlies much of the regional \neconomic  inequality;  there  has  been  a  big  gap  between  the  Western  Province  and  the  rest  of  the  country.  The  Western \nProvince accounts for half of the total output in the country, while all other provinces contribute 10% or less each. It also has \nthe best access to business opportunities, while geographical isolation and high average travel time to Colombo seem to be \nmost closely correlated with poverty in other provinces.  \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nPolitical economy considerations have ensured that successive Sri Lankan governments have been concerned with issues of \npoverty,  inequality,  and  welfare.  However,  over  the  last  decade,  the  approach  to  poverty  reduction  has  undergone  a \nsignificant  change.  Government  policy  now  recognizes  that  poverty  has  many  dimensions  and  correlates,  which  require  an \nintegrated  development  policy  framework.  In  particular,  the  current  government\u2019s  strong  emphasis  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  reduce  regional  inequalities  and  enable  less-developed  regions  and  localities  to  link  up  with  the  growth \nprocess is noteworthy. \n \nThe project will create greater fiscal space through augmentation of revenues due to a strengthened tax administration and \nefficient  management  of  fiscal  operations,  which  will  make  it  possible  for  the  government  to  increase  development \nexpenditures  on  physical  and  social  infrastructure  and  the  investments  required  to  support  livelihoods  of  vulnerable \npopulations and to put the country on an accelerated growth path. \n \n2.  Design Features. \n \n1.  FMEP  outputs  are  expected  to  lead  to  the  deepening  of  policy  reforms  undertaken  through  the  Fiscal  Management \n\nReform Program by putting in place automated systems toward the operationalization of those policy reforms.  \n\n2.  The  FMEP  has  three  components:  (i)  more  accountable  revenue  management,  through  the  revenue  administration \nmanagement information system (RAMIS); (ii) more effective expenditure management, through the ITMIS; and (iii) more \ncapable public resource managers, through extensive capacity development and training. \nImplementation  of  the  RAMIS  is  expected  to  lead  to  increased  revenue  collection  by  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  the \nrevenue  collection  process,  and  increased  quality  of  the  work  environment  to  generate  higher  productivity;  these  will \nenable better service delivery to taxpayers, thus increasing voluntary compliance. \n\n3. \n\n4.  The  ITMIS  will  cut  across  various  functions  of  general  treasury  activities  and  lead  to  the  computerization  of  public \n\nfinancial management processes, including budget preparation and execution, accounting, and reporting.  \n\n \nC.     Poverty Impact Analysis for Project Lending  \n \n1. \n\nThe  overall  impact  of  the  project  will  be  to  give  the  government  greater  scope  to  increase  investments  for  improved \nsocial  and  economic  development,  particularly  in  underdeveloped  and  disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country.  The \ngovernment  is  expected  to  have  greater  financial  flexibility  through  increased  revenues  and  efficiencies  in  public \nexpenditure  management.  The  greater  investments,  in  turn,  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  human \nresources  and  physical  infrastructure,  thereby  attracting  private  sector  investments  leading  to  greater  employment \nopportunities, especially in Northern and Eastern provinces. Government finances are expected to move to a virtuous \ncycle of efficient investments leading to economic growth and consequent higher revenues through better tax collection, \nstemming from a strengthened revenue administration system, for the government to invest further in the improvement \nof social and physical infrastructure. These benefits will be delivered to the beneficiaries in the short-to-medium term. \nDiscuss  the  impact  of  the  policy  reform(s)  on  vulnerable  groups  and  ways  to  address  it/them  (refer  to  social \nanalysis): There are two vulnerable segments that will benefit from the project\u2014the conflict-affected population directly, \nand  poor  people  in  the  less-developed  areas.  They  will  benefit  through  better  economic  management,  infrastructure \ndevelopment, and strengthening of the fiscal positions of provincial councils. There are no adverse effects identified that \nwill affect any segment of society.  \nDiscuss  how  the  policy  reform(s)  contribute(s)  to  poverty  reduction,  pro-poor  growth,  and  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals:  The  project  will  support  expenditure  rationalization  and  revenue  enhancement  which  will \ncontribute  to  fiscal  sustainability.  This  will  address  a  significant  macroeconomic  issue  in,  and  contribute  to,  economic \nstability.  The  project  will  work  closely  with  the  Presidential  Commission  on  Tax  Reforms  in  this  area.  Enhanced \nbudgetary allocations to the North, and to social sectors, will contribute directly to poverty reduction, which is the focus \nof  the  first  MDG.  Strengthening  provincial  revenues  will  also  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  empowering  a  tier  of \ngovernment  at  the  second  level.  This,  together  with  enhanced  and  more  effective  financing  of  infrastructure,  will  also \nfacilitate pro-poor growth. \n\nII.       SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The key socioeconomic issues that are evident in the FMEP deal with the adverse impacts of mismanagement of \npublic resources on the economy as a whole and on the lives of the citizens (largely through poor service delivery and greater \ncosts  of  accessing  services).  Another  issue  is  how  the  government  can  translate  greater  fiscal  space  (sought  under  this \nproject) into greater investments in social and economic infrastructure that will directly address the needs of poor people. The \nFMEP attempts to introduce a culture of results in the public service. There are also attempts to simplify provision of services \nand automate critical operations and make them more efficient. The social impact of critical elements, such as the automation \nof revenue and expenditure management information systems, has been adequately considered. Measures such as these will \nhave positive economic as well as social effects, including a greater level of public trust in government, and more transparent \nand efficient service delivery.  \n \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  As  there  is  no  specific  social  issue  under  the  FMEP,  no  social  indicator  is  required  to  be \nincluded  in  the  project  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social  development  activities  or  social  impacts  during  project \nimplementation.  \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n51\n\nB.

Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \n \nStakeholder groups engaged in project formulation include government agencies, think tanks, and business associations. The \ndecisions made through consultation and participation processes included (i) computerization and simplification of processes, \nincluding  those  in  revenue  and  expenditure  management  information  system,  and  (ii)  related  capacity  development  and \ntraining.  \n \n2.

Gender and Development \n\n \n\n1.  Key Issues. \n \nSri Lanka ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1981, and the Optional \nProtocol  in  October  2002,  but  there  is  limited  progress  toward  gender  equality.  Sri  Lanka  is  ranked  104th  in  the  Human \nDevelopment Index,c 92nd in the Gender Development Index, and 100th out of 108 countries  in the  Gender Empowerment \nMeasure, with a value of 0.371. It has not achieved the second MDG of universal primary education but has virtually achieved \nthe third goal\u2014gender equality in participation in primary and secondary education.  \n \nDespite  the  country's  low  maternal  mortality  rate  of  27  per  100,000  and  very  low  child  mortality  rate,  large  numbers  of \npeople, especially women, and particularly those in rural (including plantation) areas and the conflict- and tsunami-affected \nregions,  are  among  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized  and  have  little  voice  in  governance  structures  at  national  level. \nStructural  changes  in  the  economy  have  led  to  a  decrease  in  the  percentage  of  women  in  the  agriculture,  fisheries,  and \nforestry sectors from 40.5% of female labor in 2002 to 34.5% in 2005, and an increase of women in the manufacturing sector \nfrom 23.7% to 26.7% in the same period. \n \nWomen, in general, bear the brunt of work in maintaining families and managing households. During natural disasters and \nconflict situations they face severe challenges regarding food and nutrition needs and security of family and assets. Studies \ndone  on  the  current  global  economic  crisis  indicate  that  large  numbers  of  women  will  become  unemployed,  face  job \ninsecurity,  be  pushed  more  into  the  informal  sector,  and  have  enormous  difficulties  in  ensuring  the  basic  needs  of  their \nfamilies  and  dependents,  especially  due  to  rising  food,  shelter,  and  transport  costs.  Women  migrant  workers  face \nretrenchment and more limited overseas employment opportunities. \n \nWith the death, disappearance, and migration of male family members during the ethnic conflict, women have had to ensure \nfamily survival during displacement and in welfare camps for internally displaced persons, and they face similar challenges in \nthe process of resettlement in their original habitats, following the end of the war.  \n \nThe 10-year development framework program (Mahinda Chintana), 2006\u22122016, has charted policy directions in all sectors \nand line ministries and offers some gender-related features for women's empowerment. The national machinery for women, \ni.e., the Ministry of Child Development and Women's Empowerment, established in 2005\u2014includes the Women's Bureau, the \nNational  Committee  on  Women,  the  Children's  Secretariat,  the  Department  of  Probation  and  Child  Care  Services,  and  the \nNational Child Protection Authority. This ministry has prepared a National Plan of Action for 2009\u20132015, in line with national \ndevelopment  imperatives  and  international  obligations,  which  provides  guidelines  for  budgetary  requirements  to  support \nwomen's equality and empowerment. \n \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women. The  proposed  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  management  policy \nand procedural reform to ensure gender-responsive budgeting and planning to enable equal access, by women and men, to \npublic  services  and  the  benefits  of  national  and  provincial  and/or  regional  development  initiatives.  The  management \ninformation  systems  to  be  introduced  will  enable  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  to  support  gender-responsive \nbudgeting  and  targeted  allocations  to  line  ministries  to  address  identified  vulnerabilities  to  ensure  gender  equity  in  fiscal \npolicy-making, fiscal planning, and public expenditure. Capacity development for relevant staff of the government institutions \nwithin the purview of the project will include training in gender analysis, gender-responsive budgeting and fiscal planning. \n  \n2.

Major problems arise if the \nsolution does not meet the expectation of the \nimplementing agency fully and is discovered \nduring project execution. \n\nTechnology obsolescence of the solution offered \nnormally has considerable impact on the solution \ndeployment. \n\nLack of clarity about the readiness of each \nstakeholder to perform his or her responsibilities \nresults in slippage of project timeline. This is \nbecause, most of the time, the magnitude of \nresponsibilities is understood only after the task \nhas started. The project execution timeframes \ncould be missed due to nonperformance of one \nstakeholder. \nDelays in policy-related decisions. During \nimplementation of any IT solution, there will be \nneed for some policy changes. In most cases, a \nclear procedure to address these kinds of \nrequirements is not planned. Normally, policy-\nrelated decisions take more time and result in \nproject delays. \nAbsence of a full-time technical team in place will \ndilute the whole purpose of the gap analysis.   \nRisk of building existing inefficiencies into the \nsystem. \n\nSolution/Mitigation \nA dedicated full-time TA team is being proposed \nwith clarity of roles and responsibility of each of \nthe team members for the entire project duration. \nThe team will work closely with the PMU with its \noffice located at MOFP. \nThere have been several detailed presentations \non the RAMIS and PAFMIS under FMRP to \nsenior officials as well as to the technical \ncommittee members. The PPTA consultants have \nalso made presentations, and held discussions \nwith key stakeholders, on the solution and there is \nunanimity in adopting a customized off-the-shelf \nsolution. \nTA project management consultants will ensure \nthat at the beginning of the project there is \nverification of the availability of the technology \nproposed by the vendor, and take necessary \nsteps if the technology is not supported by \ntechnology provider in the medium-to long-term. \nThe PPTA consultants have undertaken a study \nof all the tasks of stakeholders and their \ninterdependencies. Critical activities have been \nidentified and there is a commitment from the \nimplementing departments to provide dedicated \nstaff to the PMU. Some time provision has been \nkept for critical activities in the project \nimplementation plan. \nThe PSC will meet at least quarterly to ensure \nthat project delays do not occur. The fact that the \nproject is being owned by MOFP, whose \nleadership has shown a strong commitment, \nmeans this risk will be mitigated. \n\nThe PMU is envisaged with representation from \nall the implementing agencies to mitigate this risk. \nTA consultancy has been proposed to support \nidentification of process improvement and \nprocess re-engineering requirements.  \nThe site work has been initiated under the FMRP \nfor the DIR and it is expected to mitigate this risk. \nITMIS and RAMIS will have an interface, and \nplanning for the interface provision has been \nensured through a common TA project \nmanagement team for both the systems. \n\nNon-readiness of implementation site at all \nlocations. \nLack of adequate interfacing between systems: \nThe IT implementation activities planned \nconcurrently by other government agencies that \nhave links with the system development are not \nfully studied.  \nDIR = Department of Inland Revenue, FMRP = Fiscal Management Reform Program, IT = information technology, \nITMIS  =  integrated  treasury  management  information  system,  MOFP  =  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning, \nPAFMIS = Public Accounting and Financial Management Information System, PMU = project management unit, \nPPTA  =  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  PSC  =  project  steering  committee,  RAMIS  =  revenue \nadministration management information system, TA = technical assistance. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 March 2010) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nSLRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "SLRe/SLRs \n$0.0087275 \nSLRs114.58 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCPS \nDIR \nFMEP \nFMRP \nGDP \nHRDC \nICT \nIDP \nIED \nIMF \nIT \nITMIS \nLIBOR \nMDG \nMOFP \nO&M \nPMU \nPPME \nPSC \nRAMIS \nTA \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncountry partnership strategy \nDepartment of Inland Revenue \nFiscal Management Efficiency Project \nFiscal Management Reform Program \ngross domestic product \nHuman Resource Development Committee \ninformation and communication technology \ninternally displaced person \nIndependent Evaluation Department \nInternational Monetary Fund \ninformation technology \nintegrated treasury management information system \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goals \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance and Planning \noperation and maintenance \n\u2013 \nproject management unit \n\u2013 \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation \n\u2013 \nproject steering committee \n\u2013 \nrevenue administration management information system \n\u2013 \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \n \n \nNOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \n", "(i) \n \n(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", "X.
