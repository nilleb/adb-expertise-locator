It is highly segmented due to \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional constraints, and investment products \nof  a  similar  nature  are  subject  to  different  regulations  and  taxation \ndepending on whether they are offered by investment companies, pre-\nneed companies, insurance companies, or bank trust departments.   \n \nHigh  taxes  on  secondary  market  transactions  in  debt  and  equity \nsecurities  have  particularly  impeded  the  development  of  efficient \nsecondary  markets,  while  taxing  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs)  of  listed \nstocks and closed-end investment funds has made capital mobilization \nthrough  the  stock  exchange  less  attractive  to  corporate  issuers  and \ninvestors.  In  this  environment,  the  domestic  financial  market  has  not \nbeen  an  effective  mechanism  for  savings  mobilization.  The  result  is \noverreliance  on  external  borrowings  to  meet  both  public  and  private \nsectors\u2019 financing requirements.  \n \nIn  the  current  economic  environment,  one  of  the  more  difficult \nchallenges facing the Philippines is to create a foundation for the NBF \nsector  to  enable  it  to  provide  essential  financial  services  needed  to \nmobilize  the  supply  of  funds  for  business  investment.  To  meet  this \nchallenge,  it  will  require  comprehensive  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy \nreforms  to  develop  a  more  efficient  and  competitive  NBF  sector; \nreduced  market  and  product  segmentation;  improved  governance  and \nrisk management practices; and greater uniformity in the regulatory and \nprudential  standards  applicable  to  the  NBF  sector  and  investment \nproducts.  These  reforms  will  take  time  to  adopt  and  have  to  be \nimplemented in sequences to ensure effectiveness.  \n \nThe  first  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  (NBFG)  program1  addressed \n(i) governance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (ii) \nmodernizing the governance and regulatory structure of the Philippines \nStock  Exchange \n(iii)  strengthening  market  oversight, \ncompliance, and enforcement of SEC; and (iv) facilitating diversification \nand innovation in corporate financing. Building on reforms under NBFG, \nfour  areas  of  weaknesses  need  to  be  further  addressed  urgently  to \npave the way for the recovery of the NBF sector. These areas include  \n(i) weak and fragmented regulatory structure and policy; (ii) supervisory \nand surveillance capacities of SEC, the regulatory agency; (iii) financial \ninformation and disclosure and prudential standards for NBFIs; and (iv) \noverreliance on banks to mobilize savings.  \n\n(PSE); \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The goal of SNFG \nis  to  promote  the  development  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector  by  (i) \nstrengthening the regulatory and policy framework for developing viable \ninstitutions and properly functioning financial markets; (ii) continuing to \nstrengthen  SEC\u2019s  enforcement  capacities,  supervisory  skills,  and \npractices;  (iii)  improving  transparency  to  protect  investors  from  fraud, \ninsolvency,  or  misconduct;  and  (iv)  facilitating  the  mobilization  of \ndomestic savings to increase supplies of funds while ensuring investor \nprotection. \n \nTo achieve these objectives, SNFG will seek to (i) establish an effective \nanti-money  laundering  regime;  (ii)  strengthen  investor  protection  and \nconfidence  in  PSE;  (iii)  remove  policy  distortions  and  address  the \nfragmented  regulatory  framework  to  promote  market  efficiency  and \ndevelopment;  (iv)  clearly  define  SEC  supervisory  responsibilities  and \nenhance  its  monitoring  and  surveillance  capacity;  (v)  improve  the \nquality  of  financial  information  disclosed  to  the  market;  (vi)  strengthen \nprudential  standards;  and  (vii)  promote  the  development  of  collective \ninvestment  vehicles  and  establish  a  proper  framework  for  investor \nprotection.  As  designed,  the  Program  will  move  the  Philippines  to  full \ncompliance  with  all  of  IOSCO\u2019s  30  Objectives  and  Principles  of \nSecurities Regulation. \n \nEconomic growth \n \nCategory  C:  The  Program  will  not  have  any  direct  and  immediate \nenvironment impact. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by \nproviding  a  loan  of  $150  million.  The  loan  will  be  from  the  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources with interest rates determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  loan  facility  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum  in  accordance  with  standard  terms  for  program \nloans. A front-end fee will be payable  in an amount equal to 0.50% of \nthe  loan.  ADB  will  be  entitled  to  withdraw  the  front-end  fee  from  the \nloan account and pay itself on behalf of the Government. The loan will \nhave an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears.  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  utilized  over  a  period  of \n36 months from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  program  period  will  be  3  years.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two \nequal  tranches.  The  first  tranche  ($75  million)  will  be  released  upon \nloan  effectiveness,  and  the  second,  18  months  after  Board  approval, \nsubject  to  the  Government\u2019s  meeting  the  conditions  specified  for  its \nrelease.  The  conditions  for  release  of  the  first  tranche  are  37  policy \nactions all of which have already been fully complied with. The second \ntranche ($75 million) will be released upon satisfactory compliance with \n13 policy conditions. \n \n\n\f      Executing     \n      Agency \n\n     Procurement \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nSNFG  program  loan  and  SEC  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  SEC \nwill  set  up  an  interagency  coordination  committee  headed  by  the \nchairperson  of  SEC  and  comprising  representatives  from  Anti-Money \nLaundering  Council,  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  DOF,  Insurance \nCommission, National Economic and Development Authority, and PSE. \nThe  committee  will  meet  every  quarter  to  coordinate  and  ensure \neffective  implementation  of  the  proposed  reforms.  ADB  will  also  be  a \nmember of the committee to oversee the progress of the Program. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of \nitems  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nitems  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).  The  Government \nwill  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of \nADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  loan  for  the  given  period. \nADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  funds  generated  by  the \nSNFG  loan  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of \nreform and to help maintain current levels of social expenditures. \n \nOne of the principal risks associated with the Program is the resistance \nof  vested  interests,  particularly  as  the  Program  is  politically  sensitive \nand  seeks  to  end  money-laundering  activities.  To  minimize  the  risks, \nthe policy actions have been formulated to cover reforms that are within \nthe  executive  branch  of  the  Government  to  implement.  The  more \ndifficult  reforms  requiring \nthe  enactment  of  politically  sensitive \nlegislation, including the passage of the amendments to the Anti-Money \nLaundering Act is included in the Program as a first tranche condition to \nprevent  the  possible  delayed  enactment  of  both  legislation  from \naffecting  the  implementation  of  other  significant  reforms  supported \nunder  the  Program.    The  Government  has  shown  political  will  to \nimplement \nthe \namendments to the Anti-money laundering law satisfactory to Financial \nAction  Task  Anti-Money  Laundering  were  passed  by  Congress  in \nMarch 2003. \n \nApart from politically sensitive legislation, the Program will also impose \nsignificant  costs  to  the  private  sector,  particularly  as  firms  will  be \nrequired to adopt International Accounting Standards (IAS). While large \naccounting firms are likely to be able to more easily adopt the required \nchanges, smaller firms will have greater difficulty and less resource for \nstaff  retraining.  Likewise,  there  will  also  be  costs  to  all  companies \nregistered with SEC as they will be required to change from Philippines \nGeneral  Accounting  and  Auditing  Principles  to  IAS  as  their  staff  will \nhave  to  be  retrained  to  meet  the  new  reporting  requirements.  The \nProgram  recognizes  the  difficulty  and  costs,  associated  with  the \nchanges and has made provision for the Government to adopt the new \naccounting  standards  gradually  until  2005.  While  the  transition  is \nrelatively shorter than that in the European Union, the risks are deemed \nadequately  mitigated  as  the  Philippines  has  a  large  pool  of  well-\nqualified  accountants,  making  the  transition  easier  than  in  many \nemerging markets.     \n\nfor  example,  despite \n\nthe  Program; \n\nresistance, \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \nLastly  with  the  Program  calling  for  SEC  to  adopt  risk-based  capital \nstandards  for  NBFIs,  there  will  be  significant  costs  to  NBFIs  to  meet \nthe  new  requirements.  A  large  number  of  NBFIs  are  likely  to  be \nrequired to raise their capital to match the risks on their balance sheet \nand  as  such  are  expected  to  strongly  object  to  the  reforms. \nNevertheless, the objection is likely to be overcome as similar reforms \nhave already been implemented in the banking sector. \n \nThe objective of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is to (i) help the \nGovernment  prepare  medium-  and  long-term  strategies  to  advance \nreforms  and  further  develop  the  NBF  sector,  and  (ii)  promote \ncompetition and remove impediments to the creation and distribution of \ninnovative financial products and services. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Second  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  (SNFG) \nProgram.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Support  for  the \nNonbank  Financial  Sector,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n\n2. \nDriven  by  a  rebound  in  external  demand  and  strong  domestic  private  consumption \n(supported by a steady inflow of remittances), the Philippine economy outperformed most of its \nneighbors  in  2002  with  the  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  growing  by  4.6%  year-on-year.2 \nInflation last year was 3.1%, which was well below the Government\u2019s target of 4.5-5.5% due in \npart  to  the  effects  of  a  less  accommodating  monetary  policy  stance  and  milder-than-expected \nweather-related disruptions to agriculture and transport, and low food prices. Nevertheless, the \nlow rate of inflation reflected continued excess industrial capacity in some sectors and high (and \nrising) unemployment. However, as the world economic recovery remains uncertain, particularly \nin  the  Philippines\u2019  export  markets  of  the  United  States  (US)  and  Europe,  the  outlook  of  the \nPhilippine  economy  is  less  robust  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  Under  the  circumstances, \nGDP  in  2003  is  expected  to  grow  more  moderately,  probably  at  a  rate  4.0-4.5%.  Despite  a \nsharp rise in food prices in June, inflation should remain subdued in 2003 reflecting a negative \noutput gap.  \n \nThe  shortfalls  in  the  revenue  collection  system  weaken  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \n3. \nperformance  in  2002  and  caused  the  budget  deficit  to  widen  to  an  estimated  5.3%  of  GDP \nagainst  the  original  target  of  P130  billion  or  3.3%  of  GDP.  While  difficulties  with  revenue \ncollection are not a new problem in the Philippines, the recent and highly criticized public focus \non  this  issue  has  strengthened  the  Government's  resolve  to  undertake  reforms  in  this  area. \nContinued  difficulties  with  fiscal  management  in  the  short  run,  however,  are  likely  to  exert \nupward  pressure  on  interest  rates\u2014dampening  domestic  demand  and  macroeconomic \nstabilization efforts. \n \n4. \nDespite the economy\u2019s positive performance, growth has not been high enough to create \nmore jobs for the rapidly growing labor force and unemployment continues to be high and rising.  \nHigher levels of investment are necessary if the economy is to attain a higher growth path and \nunemployment is to be reduced.   \n \n5. \nThe  financial  sector  clearly  has  a  central  part  to  play  in  this  effort  through  its  role  of \nchanneling savings to productive investment to finance growth. Currently, however, the financial \nsector in the Philippines is bank-dominated and lending by the banking system to the corporate \nsector  has  been  highly  constrained  by  banks\u2019  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  that  have  steadily \naccumulated  since  the  crisis.  Latest  estimates  point  to  NPLs  at  above  15%  of  commercial \nbanks\u2019 total  assets. The  high  level  of  NPLs  within  the  banking  system  and  overreliance  of  the \ncorporate sector on bank lending are symptomatic of weak governance in the financial sector, \nand  lack  of  alternative  sources  of  financing  to  the  banking  system.  Reforms  to  address  these \ndistortions  and  support  the  development  of  a  sound  nonbank  financial  (NBF)  sector  are \n\n                                                           \n1   This section is a brief update on recent economic developments.  It should be read in conjunction with the Country \n\nEconomic Review (2003). \n\n2   This and other figures in the section were taken from Asian Development Outlook 2003 Statistical Appendix. \n\n\f 2\n\nessential if the financial sector is to act as a facilitator of, rather than a constraint to, long-term \neconomic growth. \n \n6. \nFinally, investment has also been significantly hindered by weak investor sentiment due \nin part to chronic and widespread graft and corruption. The Government efforts to establish an \neffective  anti-money  laundering  (AML)  regime,  however,  represent  an  important  step  in \naddressing  this  problem,  as  an  effective  regime  has  the  potential  to  serve  as  a  key  tool  in \ntackling graft and corruption. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nRegulation and Supervisory Framework \n\n1. \n \nThe  NBF  sector  comprises  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE)3  and  a  variety  of \n7. \nfinancial  intermediaries  including  investment  houses, finance  companies,  broker-dealers firms, \nmutual  funds,  investment  management  companies,  insurance  companies,  and  pre-need  plan \ncompanies. Pawnshops and lending investors providing loans to individuals, money changers, \nand  money  transmitters  are  also  classified  as  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  in  the \nPhilippines (Appendix 1). \n \n8. \nThe  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  is  the  main  regulator  of  NBFIs \nengaged in capital market activities. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank, also \nregulates  and  supervises  NBFIs  that  are  subsidiaries  of  commercial  banks  and  those  with \nquasi-banking license, trust operations and foreign products and services, and pawnshops. SEC \nwas  established  in  1936  under  Commonwealth  Act  83.  In  1975,  SEC  was  reorganized  under \nPresidential Decree 902A into a quasi-judicial body with authority to investigate and prosecute \nfraud  and  other  forms  of  misconduct,  adjudicate  corporate  disputes,  and  interpret  the  laws \nadministered  by  SEC.  Under  Decree  902A,  SEC  was  also  responsible  for  supervising  the \nadministration  of  insolvent  companies.  In  1982,  under  the  Revised  Securities  Act,  SEC  was \ngiven  authority  to  act  as  a  securities  regulatory  body.  In  addition  to  acting  as  a  securities \nregulatory body, SEC also serves as a registrar of companies, both publicly and privately held. \n \n9. \nThe Government promulgated the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) in 2000. The SRC \nsuperseded  the  Revised  Securities  Act  and  Presidential  Degree  902A  and  has  narrowed  the \nmandate of SEC to regulation of the securities markets and enforcement. The new law allowed \nSEC  to  transfer  its  quasi-judicial  function  to  courts.  In  addition,  it  provides  SEC  with  greater \nautonomy, indemnification for its staff against lawsuits, and greater financial resources to meet \nSEC\u2019s  new  mandate.  As  a  result  of  the  powers  granted  to  SEC,  no  domestic  or  foreign \nsecurities  other  than  exempt  securities  may  be  offered  to  the  public  without  being  registered \nwith SEC. Under the new law, SEC is allowed, however, to continue to maintain its function as a \nregistrar of both public and private companies. SEC, as such, supervises, not only companies \nwith  publicly  traded  securities,  but  also  all  corporations,  partnerships,  and  associations,  which \nare required to register with SEC.  \n \n10. \nThe SRC requires the demutualization of PSE in response to the inside trading scandal \nin  2000.  Additional  laws  governing  NBFIs  include  the  Corporation  Code,  the  Investment \n\n                                                           \n3  Supported  by  the  Philippines  Central  Depository  and  the  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  for \n\nclearance and settlement of trades. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n2. \n\nRecent Performance of the Capital Markets \n\nCompany Act, the Financing Company Act, and Presidential Decree 129 on Investment Houses. \nNBFIs, which are subsidiaries of commercial banks, and those with quasi-banking license, trust \noperations  and  foreign  products  and  services,  and  pawnshops  are  governed  by  the  General \nBanking Law of 2002 and the BSP Manual of Regulations for NBFIs. \n \n11. \nInsurance companies, on the other hand, are regulated and supervised by the Insurance \nCommission  (IC).  IC  is  responsible  for  licensing  and  supervising  all  insurance  companies, \nagents, adjusters, and actuaries. Insurance regulation is based on the Insurance Code of 1978, \nas amended, and along with implementing circulars and department orders offered by IC. BSP \nis  not  involved  in  regulating  and  supervising  insurance  companies  even  though  these \ncompanies may be part of a financial group affiliated with banks or other financial entities. \n    \n \n \n12. \nActivities  relating  to  the  equity  market  are  centered  on  PSE.  The  equity  market,  which \npeaked in 2000, has just begun to show signs of recovery after 2 years of sharp decline amid a \ndifficult  global  economic  environment.  PSE\u2019s  market  capitalization  dipped  to  P2,083.2  trillion \n($46.4  billion)  from  its  peak  of  P2.6  trillion  ($58.8  billion)  in  2000  and  recovered  to  P2,493.8 \ntrillion ($46.4 billion) by 30 June 2003. As of today, PSE lists 233 companies. \n \nThe  trading  volume  has  been  thin  since  2000;  from  January  to  June  2003,  31.3  billion \n13. \nshares were traded, compared with 949 billion in 1999. Market turnover had fallen to just P40 \nbillion, or slightly above 1.0% of the capitalization by 30 June 2003, from P781 billion, or about \n40%,  in  1999  (Table  1).  The  depressed  market  conditions  in  2001  and  2002  reduced  the \nearnings  of  PSE  and  NBFIs  that  rely  on  the  equity  trading  volume  as  a  major  source  of \nrevenues.  Consequently,  PSE\u2019s  operating  income  fell  from  P324.4  million  in  2000  to  P160.4 \nmillion in 2001, and to P159.5 million in 2002.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                           \n4   Philippines Stock Exchange, 2002 Annual Report. \n \n\n\f 4\n\nTable 1: Market Highlights, 1999\u20132003 \n \n\nItem \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n \nMarket Capitalization (P billion) \nTrading Value ((P billion) \nTrading Volume (billion shares) \nIndices (year-end closing) \n\nComposite \n\nCapital Raised ((P billion) \nInitial Public Offering \nAdditional Listings \n\nEquities \n\nListed Companies  \nDomestic \nForeign \nListed Issues \nDomestic \nForeign \n\nDebt \n\nGovernment Securities \n\nExchange Rate (P/$) \n\nAverage \nEnd-of-Period \n\n \n1,251.3 \n586.2 \n1,924.0 \n \n1,869.2 \n32.1 \n10.1 \n22.0 \n \n\n221 \n221 \n0 \n300 \n300 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n29.5 \n40.0 \n\n \n1,373.7 \n408.7 \n287.8 \n \n1,968.8 \n37.5 \n1.0 \n36.5 \n \n\n222 \n222 \n0 \n302 \n302 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n40.9 \n39.1 \n\n \n1,937.7 \n781.0 \n949.0 \n \n2,143.0 \n42.1 \n0.8 \n41.3 \n \n\n225 \n224 \n1 \n305 \n304 \n1 \n \n0 \n \n39.1 \n40.3 \n\n \n2,577.7 \n357.7 \n659.4 \n \n1,494.5 \n37.2 \n0.6 \n36.6 \n \n\n230 \n228 \n2 \n309 \n307 \n2 \n \n0 \n \n44.2 \n50.0 \n\n2003 \n(Jan \u2013 Jun \n2003) \n\n \n\n2,083.2  2,493.8 \n40.0 \n31.3 \n \n1,222.8 \n0.3 \n0.03 \n0.2 \n \n233 \n231 \n2 \n311 \n309 \n2 \n \n1 \n \n53.5 \n53.7 \n\n159.7 \n99.8 \n \n1018.4 \n40.1 \n3.6 \n36.5 \n \n234 \n232 \n2 \n310 \n308 \n2 \n \n1 \n \n51.6 \n53.1 \n\n \n\n \n2,141.4 \n159.6 \n164.4 \n \n1,168.1 \n7.3 \n0.2 \n7.1 \n\n \n\n231 \n229 \n2 \n311 \n308 \n2 \n \n1 \n \n51.0 \n51.4 \n\nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange. \n \n14. \nPSE  market  capitalization  is  largely  concentrated  on  the  top  50  companies;  the top  10 \ncompanies accounted for about 79% of market capitalization and the top 50 companies for over \n90% as of June 2003. The shares of about 180 companies are not often traded. It is estimated \nthat the top 20 brokers account for about 90% of the turnover, and the top 4 account for about \n25%. Many of the small brokers account for less than 1% of the turnover.  \n \n15.  With  a  recurring  budget  deficit  since  1998,  the  fixed  income  market  in  the  Philippines \nconsists largely of government debt instruments (treasury bills with tenors of 91, 182, and 364 \ndays  and  bonds  with  maturity  of  2,  5,  7,  10,  20  and  25  years).  Except  for  small-denomination \nbonds  listed  on  PSE,  debt  instruments  are  traded  over  the  counter.  As  of  June  2003,  the \noutstanding Government domestic debt securities totaled P1,521 billion and that of commercial \npapers  (CPs)  about  P14.7  billion.  Treasury  bills,  which  account  for  about  32%  of  outstanding \nGovernment  domestic  debt  securities,  are  traded  more  frequently  than  Government  bonds. \nAlthough CPs account for a small fraction of the domestic debt market, they are more frequently \ntraded.  Over  the  past  3  years,  the  Bankers  Association  of  the  Philippines  (BAP)  and  the \nInvestment House Association of the Philippines (IHAP) have been working to establish a fixed \nincome  exchange  that  would  allow  the  trading  of  debt  instruments,  including  government \nsecurities,  corporate  bonds,  CPs,  asset-backed  securities,  and \nlong-term  negotiable \ninstruments. It is expected that the exchange will be opened for trading during the early part of \n2004. \n \nB. \n\nRecent Reforms in the Nonbank Financial Sector  \n\n16. \nThe enactment of SRC in 2000 was the cornerstone of the reforms in the NBF sector in \nthe Philippines. To meet its new mandate under SRC, SEC reorganized itself and has built the \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nincluding  market  regulation,  corporation \n\ncapacity of its staff, with assistance from ADB5 to strengthen regulation and enforcement. A new \nset  of  core  operating  departments, \nfinance, \nenforcement, and compliance and inspection, has been established. SEC reorganized its staff \nand developed a full-scale training program in market surveillance and monitoring, enforcement, \nand  compliance  in  conformity  with  the  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  according  to  the  SEC \nmandate. With ADB assistance, SEC is also strengthening staff skills relating to a management \ninformation system (MIS) for better monitoring and surveillance of market participants. With the \nSRC  provision  allowing  SEC  to  raise  salary  standards  to  attract qualified  staff,  SEC  has  been \nable to increasingly attract and retain qualified staff.   \n \n17. \nIn 2002, SEC adopted the Code of Corporate Governance requiring all listed companies \nto have at least 20% of independent directors to represent the public and minority shareholders\u2019 \ninterests.  Recently,  SEC  sought  to  tighten  this  requirement  further  by  increasing  the \nindependent directors from 20% or two independent directors whichever is lower, to 20% or two \nindependent directors whichever is higher.  \n\n PSE  has  also  undertaken  a  number  of  reforms.  As  a  member-owned  limited-liability \n18. \ncompany  with  objectives  to  provide  services  and  minimize  costs  for  its  members  rather  than \nseek  to  maximize  profits,  PSE  has  used  its  operating  surpluses  to  cover  losses  from  any \nunlikely  system  failures,  or  to  improve  systems  and  facilities  for  market  development,  public \nawareness, and investor education. However, due to the inside trading scandal of BW shares in \n2000, PSE was criticized for being a cozy club of members that acted to protect the interest of \nits own members. To restore investors\u2019 confidence in the market weakened by the BW scandal, \nPSE took steps to demutualize by transforming itself from a non-profit member organization into \na  for-profit  stock  corporation  in  2001.  Along  with  the  change,  PSE  ownership  of  shares  has \nsince been separated from trading rights to allow the entry of new market players. Each of the \n184  members  now  owns  50,000  PSE  shares  and  trading  rights  and  is  now  allowed  to  sell \nhis/her shares while retaining his/her trading rights. PSE\u2019s governance has also been changed; \nthe majority of the PSE board members is now nonbroker directors.   \n\n19. \n To  improve  its  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  structure,  PSE  has  reconstituted  its \ncompliance and enforcement division and has strengthened its market monitoring systems with \nthe implementing the electronic net capital reporting and monitoring system for brokers/dealers \nto  permit  daily  monitoring.  Moreover,  PSE  has  adopted  an  on-line  daily  disclosure  system  to \nimprove  the  transparency  of  listed  companies.  PSE  and  trading  participants  and  listed \ncompanies  have  also  adopted  the  Corporate  Governance  Code  and  AML  Guidelines.  Trading \nparticipants  and  securities  traders  and  salespeople  have  also  since  adopted  a  Code  of  Ethics \nand  Code  of  Conduct  and  Ethics,  respectively.6  PSE  also  launched  its  enhanced  web  site  to \nprovide  more  comprehensive  market  data,  stock  quotations,  dividend  declarations,  trading \nactivities,  and  other  pertinent  information  on  the  exchange,  trading  participants,  listed \ncompanies, and other institutions.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\n                                                           \n5  ADB. 1999.

As is, the sector is small \nand underdeveloped (Table 2), accounting for just about 20% of the total assets in the financial \nsystem.  Moreover,  legal,  regulatory,  institutional,  and  policy  constraints  have  made  the  sector \nfragmented that investment products of a similar nature are subject to different regulations and \ntaxation depending on whether they are offered by investment companies, pre-need companies, \ninsurance companies, or bank trust departments. Currently, there are no full service securities \ncompanies or investment banks offering a full range of broker, dealer, underwriting and ancillary \nservices  to  investors  and  issuers  of  securities,  which  could  compete  on  a  regional  or  global \nbasis.  \n\n \nTable 2: Profile of the Nonbank Financial Sector \n \nDec \n1999 \n\nDec \n1997 \n\nDec \n2000 \n\nDec \n1998 \n\nDec \n2001 \n\nDec \n2002 \n\n7,391 \n \n\n7,383 \n12 \n\n5,215 \n \n5,207 \n12 \n\n5,328 \n \n\n5,320 \n12 \n\n5,262 \n \n5,255 \n12 \n\n5,254 \n \n\n5,247 \n12 \n\nAs  % of Total \nAssets in the \nFinancial \nSystem \n20 \n \n9.6 \n0.9 \n\n7,032 \n \n7,024 \n12 \n\n8 \n4 \n \n2,581 \n43 \n139 \n64 \n130 \n\n7 \n5 \n \n2,797 \n45 \n142 \n64 \n130 \n\n2,195 \n \n\n2,406 \n \n\n10 \n \n90 \n \n7 \n145 \n\n10 \n \n90 \n \n7 \n148 \n\nTYPE OF INSTITUTION \n\nNonbank Financial Institutions \nPrivate Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions \n\nWith Quasi-Banking \nFunctions \n\nInvestment Houses  \nFinancing Companies \n\nWithout Quasi-Banking \nFunctions \n\nInvestment Houses \nFinancing Companies \nInvestment Companies \nSecurities \nDealers/Brokers \nLending Investors \nCredit Card \nCompanies \nVenture Capital Corp, \n\nNonstock Savings and \nLoan Associations \nMutual Building and Loan \nAssociations \nPrivate Insurance \nCompanies  \n\nof which Life insurance \nCompanies \n\nPawnshops \nGovernment Nonbank \nFinancial Institutions \n\na  In billion pesos\u2019. \nSource:  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \n\n7 \n5 \n \n136 \n31 \n42 \n11 \n22 \n\n12 \n10 \n\n8 \n \n90 \n \n7 \n153 \n\n7 \n5 \n \n123 \n24 \n40 \n11 \n22 \n\n11 \n7 \n\n8 \n \n90 \n \n6 \n155 \n\n7 \n5 \n \n134 \n29 \n43 \n11 \n26 \n\n9 \n7 \n\n9 \n \n85 \n \n6 \n151 \n\n7 \n5 \n \n126 \n26 \n40 \n9 \n26 \n\n9 \n7 \n\n9 \n \n85 \n \n6 \n150 \n\n0.7 \n0.3 \n \n2.3 \n0.8 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n0.3 \n\n0.2 \n0.4 \n\n0.0 \n \n0.1 \n \n0.0 \n5.1 \n\n \n3.5 \n0.3 \n \n10.5 \n\n \n36 \n4,189 \n \n8 \n\n \n38 \n4,329 \n \n8 \n\n \n40 \n4,809 \n \n8 \n\n \n42 \n4,934 \n \n8 \n\n \n40 \n5,018 \n \n7 \n\n \n40 \n5,018 \n \n7 \n\n \n21. \nHigh  taxes  on  secondary  market  transactions  in  debt  and  equity  securities  have \nparticularly  impeded  the  development  of  efficient  secondary  markets,  while  taxing  initial  public \nofferings (IPOs) of listed stocks and closed-end investment funds has made capital mobilization \nthrough  the  stock  exchange  less  attractive  to  corporate  issuers  and  investors.  In  this \nenvironment,  the  domestic  financial  market  has  not  been  as  effective  as  it  should  be  as  a \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nmechanism  for  savings  mobilization,  the  result  is  overreliance  on  external  borrowings  to  meet \nthe financing requirements of both the public and private sectors.  \n \n22. \nIn  the  current  economic  environment,  one  of  the  more  difficult  challenges  facing  the \nPhilippines is to create a foundation for the NBF sector to enable it to provide essential financial \nservices  needed  to  mobilize  the  supply  of  funds  for  business  investment.  To  meet  this \nchallenge, comprehensive legal, regulatory, and policy reforms are required for a more efficient \nand competitive NBF sector, reduced market and product segmentation, improved governance \nand  risk  management  practices,  and  greater  uniformity  in  the  regulatory  and  prudential \nstandards applied to the NBF sector and investment products. These reforms will take time to \nadopt  and  will  have  to  be  implemented  in  sequence  or  in  phases  to  ensure  effectiveness. \nBuilding  on  reforms  under  the  nonbank  financial  governance  program  (NBFG),  four  areas  of \nweaknesses will be addressed to pave the way for the recovery of the NBF sector: (i) weak and \nfragmented  regulatory  structure  and  policy;  (ii)  supervisory  and  surveillance  capacities  of  the \nregulatory  agency,  SEC;  (iii)  financial  information  and  disclosure  and  prudential  standards  for \nNBFIs; and (iv) continued overreliance on banks to mobilize savings. \n \n\n1. \n\nWeak and Fragmented Regulatory and Policy Framework  \n \na. \n\nList of Noncooperative Countries and Territories (NCCTs) \n\n \n23. \nAs  early  as  the  late  1990s,  BSP  introduced  a  number  of  measures  to  strengthen  AML \nlaws  and  procedures  based  on  its  existing  legislative  and  supervisory  authority.  These \nmeasures include prohibiting anonymous accounts and introducing customer identification and \nreporting requirements. Strict provisions under the Bank Secrecy Act, however, have prevented \nbank examiners from accessing customer account information. \n \nAs  the  second  step  toward  establishing  an  effective  AML  regime,  an  AML  law8  was \n24. \nenacted on 29 September 2001. Since proceeds from crime can be laundered through a wide \nvariety of financial institutions, \u201ccovered institutions\u201d under the law include all financial (bank and \nnonbank)  institutions  under  the  supervision  of  BSP,  SEC,  and  IC. The  law,  however,  allows  a \nlimited  exception  to  the  Bank  Secrecy  Act,  requiring  the  \u201ccovered  institutions\u201d  to  report  to  the \nAnti-Money  Laundering  Council  (AMLC)  any  transaction  in  excess  of  P4,000,000  (about \n$75,000  at  the  current  exchange  rate).  A  subsequent  assessment  of  the  law  by  the  Financial \nAction Task Force on Money Laundering\u2019s (FATF), however, identified several deficiencies: (i) \nthe  threshold  for  suspicious  transactions  is  too  high  to  constitute  a  meaningful  deterrent  to \nmoney  laundering  (compared  with  the  standard  threshold  norm  of  about  $10,000);  and  (ii) \nprovisions  in  the  law  hinder  rather  than  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  power  to  carry  out \neffective investigations.   \n \nThe Philippines, consequently, has been included  on the FATF list of NCCTs and had to \n25. \nenact  amendments  to  the  AML  law  satisfactory  to  the  FATF  by  March  2003  to  avoid \ncountermeasures.  Additionally,  it  will  have  substantially  complied  with  other  recommendations \nconcerning  effective  measures  to  combat  money  laundering  activities  to  be  removed  from  the \nFATF list of NCCTs. \n \n \n\n                                                           \n8   Republic Act 9160. \n\n\f 8\n\nb. \n\nOwnership and Governance Structure of the Philippines Stock \nExchange \n\n26. \nUnder  SRC,  PSE  is  required  to  be  demutualized  with  no  single  group  of  shareholders \nowning  more  than  20%  of  PSE,  and  no  single  individual  or  entity  owning  more  than  5%.  As \nindicated earlier, PSE has been corporatized through conversion into a shareholding corporate \nstructure and has achieved the goal of having more than one- half of its board of directors as \nnonmembers,  or  independent  external  directors.  However,  it  has  yet  to  achieve  the  SRC \nmandate of divestiture. \n   \n\nc. \n\nUnfavorable Policy Environment \n\n \nTaxes  are  identified  as  one  of  the  major  factors  impeding  market  efficiency  and \n27. \ndevelopment  of  the  NBF  sector.  There  is  no  capital  gains  tax  on  listed  equity  securities; \nhowever,  there  is  a  10%  value-added  tax  on  the  brokerage  commission.  Moreover,  all  shares \nand  stock  certificates  are  subject  to  a  stamp  duty  tax  of  1.0%  and  all  debt  instruments  to  a \nrange  of  0.3-1.5%  documentary  stamp  tax  (DST),  depending  on  the  type  of  instrument  (i.e., \ndebentures or CPs). For deposits in commercial banks, however, the DST is not applied across \nthe  board.  Only  time  deposits  (with  a  minimum  of  P50,000)  are  subject  to  the  DST;  other \ndeposits such as those in special accounts (with a minimum of P300,000) are DST exempt.    \n \n28.  More  importantly,  when  traded,  both  debt  and  equity  instruments  are  subject  to  an \nadditional  DST  on  the  buyer  and  a  stock  transaction  tax  on  the  seller,  which,  combined,  add \n1.25% to the transaction cost.  Failure to attach the stamp will make the document unacceptable \nin  third  party  transactions  and  cannot  be  used  as  evidence  in  court.  A  major  drawback  of  the \nDST  is  the  application  of  the  tax  every  time  the  instrument  changes  hand;  the  more  time  the \nfinancial instruments are traded, the higher the costs to the investors. The cascading feature of \nthe DST discourages the trading of financial instruments and market development and, as such, \nreduces liquidity in the secondary markets, not only for debts but also for equity instruments.9 \n \n29. \nThe  tax  revenue  from  the  secondary  trading  of  equity  instruments  varies  with  the \nperformance  of  the  equity  market,  ranging  from  about  P400  million  to  about  P1.4  billion \nannually, while that from secondary trading of debt instruments is estimated to range from P200 \nmillion  to  P500  million.  The  tax  revenue  collected  from  DST  on  debt  and  equity  instruments \nrepresent less than 1% of the aggregate revenue. However, as DST is a relatively more reliable \nsource of revenue and convenient to collect, it is very difficult for the Government to eliminate it.  \n  \n30. \n Aside  from  the  DST,  equity  securities  listed  on  PSE,  including  closed-end  funds,  are \nsubject to an initial public offering (IPO) tax of 2-4% depending on the float available to public \nshareholders. The IPO tax makes it more costly than it should be for business to raise needed \ncapital for investment and reduces the Philippines\u2019 ability to compete for issuers particularly in \nlight of growing competition among the stock exchanges within the region. \n \n31. \nIt is recognized that the NBF sector, like any other sector in the economy, should pay its \nshare of tax revenue; however, taxation should minimize the distortions in the financial markets. \nThe  above  taxes,  combined,  have  reduced  the  efficiency  of  financial  markets  and  have  made \nalternative sources to bank financing too costly.  \n \n\n                                                           \n9   Studies in the United Kingdom and on international equity turnover by Jackson and O\u2019Donnell (1985) and Ericsson \nand Lindgren (1992) shows that a 10% increase in transactions costs reduces turnover by 10-17% in the long- run.   \n\n\f9\n\n \n\n \n\nAs  indicated  earlier,  the  NBF  sector  and  capital  market  are  underdeveloped  and \n32. \nfragmented in the Philippines. As a result, the capital market has not been an effective mechanism \nfor  domestic  capital mobilization. It  is  also  not  well  prepared  to  compete  in  the  evolving regional \nand global financial markets. Nevertheless, the SRC recognizes the importance of promoting the \ndevelopment of the capital market along with the need to protect investors and eliminate practices \nthat create distortions in the market. To achieve the goals contemplated in SRC 2000, it is crucial \nthat SEC carefully assess and address the economic impact of regulatory policy, market structure, \nand taxation issues on the operations and efficiency of the capital markets and fully develop the \nmedium-term  framework  for  the  NBF  sector  into  a  comprehensive  long-term  strategy  to  develop \nthe NBF sector.  \n\n2. \n\nSEC Supervisory and Surveillance Capacities  \n\n33. \nAs indicated earlier, the SRC has made SEC a more enforcement-oriented, operationally \nindependent regulator with clear objectives and procedure. However, SEC needs to continue to \nwork  on  enhancing  the  enforcement  skills  of  its  staff  to  ensure  effective  regulation  and \nenforcement.  Moreover,  its  electronic  information  management  capacity  needs  to  be  further \nenhanced  to  have  updated  information  readily  available  for  inspection,  investigation,  and \nsurveillance. \n \n34.  While  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  over  NBFIs  should  be  clearly  defined,  joint \ninspection  should  also  be  encouraged  where  necessary.  In the  Philippines,  three Government \norganizations  are  responsible  for  regulating  and  supervising  NBFIs;  (i)  SEC,  (ii)  BSP,  and  (iii) \nIC.  In  1999,  BSP  and  SEC  entered  into  an  agreement  on  the  exercise  of  regulatory  and \nsupervisory authority over NBFIs (with the exception of insurance companies, which traditionally \nhave  come  exclusively  under  the  domain  of  IC).  Under  the  agreement  BSP  is  responsible  for \nsupervising  investment  houses  and  other  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  of  universal  banks,  which \nare also registered with SEC to perform capital market activities such as underwriting. As BSP \nis  moving  toward  consolidated  supervision,  which  will  result  in  a  reorganization  and  merger  of \nthe  bank  and  nonbank  supervision  departments,  in  conjunction  with  building  an  effective \nconsolidated  supervisory  framework,  it  would  be  highly  desirable  to  amend  the  agreement \nbetween BSP and SEC to provide for joint inspection by BSP and SEC. Joint inspection of the \ninvestment house and securities broker and dealer subsidiaries or affiliates of banks is essential \nto avoid potential gaps arising from separate on-site inspections and to allow the use of SEC\u2019s \nexpertise. \n \n\n3. \n\nMove to Strengthen Transparency and Prudential Regulations \n\n35. \nTo  improve  the  quality  of  financial  information  and  disclosure,  the  Government  has \ngradually moved away from the Philippines General Accounting and Auditing Principles (GAAP) \nand  has  phased  in  the  adoption  of  auditing  and  accounting  standards  based  on  international \nauditing and accounting standards since 2001, with a target of completing adoption by 2004 and \n2005,  respectively.  Nevertheless,  other  standards  to  ensure  investor  protection  from  fraud, \ninsolvency, or misconduct, including prudential, fit and proper standards, and a basic element of \nself-regulation should be established and/or further strengthened.   \n \n36. \nFirst,  securities  broker-dealers  and  investment  houses  are  subject  to  inconsistent  capital \nrequirements. Brokers and dealers in securities are subject to SEC\u2019s net capital rule. The rule is \nlargely risk-based and derived from the US SEC uniform net capital rule. Investment houses, on \nthe  other  hand,  are  subject  to  capital  standards  defined  under  the  implementing  guidelines  of \n\n\f 10\n\nBSP.10 More importantly, capital requirements for all types of NBFIs are not sufficiently calibrated to \nthe  risks  they  are  assuming,  nor  do  they  provide  sufficient  early  warning  in  the  event  an  NBFI \nencounters financial distress that might lead to insolvency. As such, the capital standards should \nbe revised and harmonized according to risks. In particular, NBFIs\u2019 risks in securities and similar \ninstruments  held  in  inventory  have  to  be  well  calibrated  and  harmonized  with  respect  to  both \nmarket  and  credit  risks.  There  should  also  be  a  tiering  of  initial  capital  requirements  (i.e.,  entry \nrequirements) depending on the nature of the risks undertaken and the types of licenses obtained \n(i.e.,  broker,  dealer,  underwriter,  and/or  full  service  securities  market  intermediary  or  investment \nhouse). Lastly, ongoing risk-based capital standards should be in harmony with those advocated \nby \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commission  (IOSCO)  for  securities  market \nintermediaries.    \n \nSecond, fit and proper standards are specifically defined in the Banking Act of 2000 but are \n37. \nnot  included  in  the  SRC  or  the  Insurance  Law.  While  these  standards\u2014which  allow  SEC  to \nprescribe, pass upon, and review the qualifications and disqualifications of appointed individuals \nor  elected  directors  and officers  and  to  disqualify  those found  unfit  to  serve\u2014are  essential for \nregulating NBFIs and conform to international best practice, SEC and IC currently do not have \nsufficient authority to adopt them. Third, all members of PSE are required to have a designated \ncompliance  officer  but  nonmembers  who  are  also  registered  with  SEC  to  engage  in \nunderwriting,  government  securities  business,  or  investment  advisor  activities  do  not  have  a \nsimilar requirement. Compliance is the most important element of regulation or self-regulation, \nas  it  begins  at  the  individual  firm  level.  It  is  the  first  line  of  defense  in  an  effective  regulatory \nscheme.  It  would  be  highly  desirable  for  NBFIs  to  designate  a  compliance  officer  who  is \nrequired  to  serve  in  an  advisory  capacity  with  responsibility  to  develop  the  procedures  and \ncapacity to comply with applicable rules and regulations. \n\n \n4. \n\nSavings Mobilization to Increase the Supply of Investment Funds  \n\n \nAmong  the  three  forms  of  collective  investment  vehicle  marketed  to  the  public\u2014(i) \n38. \ncommon  trust  funds  (CTFs)  managed  by  banks,  (ii)  mutual  funds  managed  by  investment \ncompanies, and (iii) pre-need schemes managed by authorized pre-need plan companies\u2014the \nlast two are constrained by the absence of a conducive policy and regulatory framework that will \nadequately  protect  investors  and  provide  a  more  conducive  environment for  both  industries to \ngrow.  This  constraint  has  impeded  the  more  effective  mobilization  of  domestic  savings  for \nfinancing business investment.    \n \n\na. \n\nPre-Need Plans \n\n39. \nThe  pre-need  industry,  which  provides  benefits  relating  to  education,  pension  funds \naccumulation,  interment  and  death-related  services,  has  grown  an  average  of  25%  annually \nover the past 15 years. Since 1977, about 6 million plans have been sold and the industry\u2019s total \nassets of P160 billion are now greater than the assets of the life insurance companies, nearly \ntwice  as  much  as  CTF  assets,  and  nearly  15  times  as  much  as  mutual  funds  net  assets.  In \nrecent years, however, the economic environment has been adverse to the successful operation \nof the pre-need industry. With few investment alternatives, the pre-need investment portfolio has \nbeen  invested  mainly  in  (i)  Treasury  bills  and  government  bonds,  (ii)  bank  deposits,  (iii)  real-\nestate, and (iv) listed stocks. Following the recent experience in global financial markets, returns \non  investments  in  both  debt  and  equity  instruments  have  been  low  relative  to  earlier  time \n\n                                                           \n10 BSP \u2013 Prescribed Capital Adequacy Ratios for Investment House (under Sec 8, P.D., No. 129, as amended by RA \n\n8366, 1October 1999. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nperiods,  while  real  estate  values,  which  have  sharply  declined  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis, \nhave yet to show signs of recovery. As such, the industry has faced great difficulty in meeting \ninvestment  objectives  based  on  the  assumption  of  expected  returns  under  more  favorable \neconomic  and  market  conditions.  In  response  to  the  poor  investment  climate,  SEC  has \nencouraged  trust  entities  to  shift  to  investment  with  high  yields,  such  as  dollar-denominated \nGovernment securities, and has allowed them to invest trust funds in better yielding investment \noutlets other than those permitted under existing investment rules.   \n \nPre-need  companies  are  required  to  keep  assets  equal  to  their  actuarial  reserve \n40. \nliabilities (ARL) representing the present value of future plan -holder benefits, in a separate trust \nfund.  When  trust  fund  assets  fall  below  the  ARL,  a  \u201ctrust  fund  deficiency\u201d  results.  During  the \npast  4  years,  over  half  of  all  pre-need  companies  experienced  trust  fund  deficiencies.  While \naround 80 pre-need companies with affiliates were registered between 1977 and 2001, only 43 \nare  licensed  to  operate  (i.e.,  sell  pre-need  plans)  in  2003.  This  is  partly  attributable  to  a \nconsiderable  degree  of  buyouts  and  mergers,11  and  the  increase  in  the  required  market  entry \ncapitalization  to  P100  million.  The  overall  deficit  in  trust  funds  (held  to  meet  plan  holder \nobligations) as of 30 August 2002 was P2.0 billion. This compares with P3.9 billion in December \n2000,  before  regulatory  action  was  taken;  however,  much  of  the  improvement  arises  from \nallocations of interest in property held by the pre-need companies to the trust funds. Of the 46 \npre-need companies reporting in August 2002, 5 had deficiencies, which were addressed as of \nSeptember  2002.  Nevertheless,  it  seems  likely  that  at  least  one  major  pre-need  company  will \nhave  to  go  through  some  form  of  resolution  in  2003,  particularly  if  necessary  prudential  and \nconsumer rights regulations are introduced. In addition, a number of trust funds are unlikely to \nbe able to comply with a newly imposed limit on real property holdings. \n \n 41.  Despite  the  industry\u2019s  rapid  growth  and recent financial  difficulty, there  has  yet  to  be  a \nlaw  specifically  governing  the  pre-need  companies.  Recently,  the  basic  sales  practices  and \ngovernance  of  the  pre-need  industry  have  been  questioned.  Regulation,  up  to  now,  has  been \nleft to SEC to establish through the issuance of rules and circulars. As the real estate market is \nnot  expected  to  recover  significantly  and  help  improve  the  financial  conditions  of  pre-need \ncompanies  over  the  near  term,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  enhance  the  monitoring  of  the \nfinancial and operational condition of the pre-need sector and to increase the frequency of on-\nsite  inspections  and  compliance  to  ensure  that  the  industry  is  solvent  and  plan  -holders  are \nprotected.   \n \n\nb. \n\nInvestment Companies/Mutual Funds  \n\n \n42.  Mutual  funds  are  operated  under  the  Investment  Company  Act  (ICA)  passed  in  the  late \n1950s. The ICA is based on the US Investment Company Act of 1940, during which time nearly all \nUS investment companies were closed-end. Since then, the mutual fund and securities businesses \nhave  undergone  significant changes. Today  the  dominant form  of  investment- company  is  open-\nend mutual funds and the regulatory regime has shifted from \u201cmerit regulation\u201d to \u201cfull disclosure.\u201d \nAs  the  ICA  was  enacted  primarily  as  a  response  to  industry  scandals  over  40  years  ago,  it  is \nobsolete  with  provisions  that  are  overly  restrictive  by  international  standards.  For  example,  one \nprovision  that  requires  all  board  members  of  investment  companies  to  be  Filipino  citizens \neffectively prevents foreign participation in investment companies organized in the Philippines. The \nminimum paid-up capital requirement under the ICA is as small as P500,000. Moreover, under the \n\n                                                           \n11  Encouraged  by  SEC.  The  companies  that  had  been  absorbed  by  the  bigger  companies  had low  paid-up  capital, \n\nfrom P1 million to P15 million. \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\ntransparency  and  accountability \n\nADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n\nlaw,  investment  companies  are  allowed  to  engage  in  direct  lending  despite  potential  conflicts  of \ninterest and abuses.  \n \n43. \nGiven the serious limitation of the ICA, the capital market development program (CMDP) \ncalled for the passage of the revised investment company act (RICA) to modernize the regulatory \nframework  for  investment  companies  in  line  with  international  best  practice  to  ensure  investor \nprotection and increase the supply of investment funds.  However, the RICA has yet to be enacted \n(Appendix 2).  \n \nD. \n  \nAs  one  of  the  two  major  development  partners  in  the  NBF  sector,12  ADB  has  been \n44. \nsupporting  the  Government  with  both  program  loans  and  technical  assistance  to  advance \nreforms  in  the  sector.  Two  loans  were  provided  for  the  sector:  (i)  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program (CMDP) loan,13 and (ii) Nonbank Financial Governance Program (NBFG) \nloan  (footnote  4). Through this  assistance,  ADB  has  established  and  maintained  a  strong  and \nconstructive policy dialogue with the Government in support of the development of the sector.  \n \nThe  CMDP,  approved  in  August  1995,  focused  on  (i)  consolidating  the  two  stock \n45. \nexchanges,  (ii)  encouraging \nincreased  public \ndisclosure of financial information, and (iii) building capacity and market confidence. The second \ntranche  of the  loan  was  scheduled for release  in  December  1997  but,  as  a  result  of  delays  in \ncompliance,  the  loan  was  closed  in  December  1999  and  the  second  tranche  cancelled.  The \npending conditions of the CMDP were linked to the passage of the Securities Act of 1999 (now \nreferred  to  as  the  SRC)  and  the  RICA.  Due  to  the  delayed  passage  of  legislation,  program \nimplementation was initially rated as unsatisfactory. Another factor that delayed implementation \nis the number of reforms attached to one piece of legislation. The SRC contains conditions and \namendments  that  were  required  to  fulfill  21  of  the  49  policy  actions  identified  in  the  CMDP. \nSubsequent  enactment  of  the  SRC,  initiated  under  the  CMDP,  resulted  in  the  rating  being \nchanged to partially successful in the program completion report. \n \n46. \nDespite  implementation  delays,  the  CMDP  lays  the  foundation  for  the  reform  under \nNBFG  with  the  enactment  of  the  SRC.  Based  on  the  SRC  and  its  implementing  rules  and \nregulations,  NBFG  could  advance  reforms  focusing  on  four  areas:  (i)  restructuring  SEC  as  a \nresult  of  the  enactment  of  the  SRC  in  2000  and  strengthening  SEC\u2019s  monitoring  and \nenforcement capacity;  (ii)  modernizing  of  the governance  and  regulatory  structure  of  PSE;  (iii) \nstrengthening market oversight, compliance, and enforcement; and (iv) facilitating diversification \nand innovation in corporate financing. As NBFG was designed as a program loan with only one \ntranche,  all  policy  conditions  under  NBFG  were  fully  complied  with  prior  to  loan  effectiveness \nand release.  \n \n47. \nTo date none of the adopted reforms under NBFG has been reversed.  With its scope of \nresponsibilities  significantly  narrowed  under  the  SRC,  SEC  is  now  able  to  focus  more  on \nenforcement  of  securities  laws  and  regulation.  SEC  fully  reorganized  itself  in  2000  and  has \nsince  gradually  built  its  capacity  and  upgraded  its  computer  system  and  MIS  to  meet  its  new \n\nthrough \n\n                                                           \n12  USAID is another development partner providing technical assistance to the sector.  \n13  ADB.  1995.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n\nPhilippines for the Capital Market Development Program Loan. Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nmandate  under  the  SRC.  PSE  has  been  corporatized  and  now  has  the  majority  nonbroker \nmembers on the governing board of directors to represent investor\u2019s interest.    \n \n48. \nAs  for  governance,  compliance,  and  enforcement,  SEC  now  requires  that  all  listed \ncompanies  have  at  least  two,  or  20%,  independent  directors  who  represent  the  public  and \nminority  shareholders\u2019  interests.  Recently,  SEC  sought  to  tighten  this  requirement  further  by \nincreasing the independent directors to 20% or two independent directors, whichever is higher. \nSEC  has  established  a  separate  department  for  compliance  and  enforcement  and  has \ndeveloped in-house training, with ADB assistance, to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement \ncapacities.   \n \n49. \nA  key  lesson  from  the  ADB  program  lending  to  the  NBF  sector  is  that  policy  actions \ndirectly involving legislative enactment can make the progress of program implementation highly \nunpredictable, regardless of the degree of Government support for the program. Commitment to \nthe  CDMP  by  the  (executive  branch  of)  Government  was  strong  and  clearly  demonstrated \nthrough its close and continuous dialogue with Congress throughout the program period. While \nhelpful in maintaining Congressional focus on the proposed legislation, this support clearly could \nnot  extend  to  ensuring  timely  enactment  by  an  independent  branch  of  Government.  The \nproposed  legislation  involved  technically  complex  issues  as  well  a  range  of  vested  interests. \nThe  result  was  a  protracted  deliberation  period.  Congressional  elections  in  May  1998  further \ndelayed  the  process  as  the  legislation  had  to  be  reintroduced  to  a  newly  reconstituted \nCongress. As such, requiring that difficult policy reforms\u2014especially those relating to legislative \nchanges\u2014be  implemented  before  the  loan  is  critical  and  is  an  important  indicator  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment.  Drawing from  lessons  learned from the  CMDP  and  other  program \nloans  for  the  Philippines,  the  second  nonbank  financial  governance  (SNFG)  is  designed  to \nensure  that  the  risks  for  noncompliance  are  minimized;  more  difficult  policy  conditions, \nparticularly  the  passage  of  politically  sensitive  amendments  to  anti-money  laundering  act,  are \nfront-loaded; and the proposed reform program supported by ADB was discussed with relevant \nstakeholders, including the legislative branch of the Government. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n50. \nThe  proposed  reform  program  under  the  SNFG  is  formulated  as  a  continuation  of  the \nprogram  supported  under  the  NBFG  (Appendix  3)  to  address  the  policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory  weaknesses  identified  earlier.  The  Program  was  formulated  based  on  IOSCO\u2019s \nObjectives and Principles of Securities Regulation, ADB\u2019s ongoing assistance in the sector, and \nthe Mission\u2019s findings. The objective of SNFG is to promote the development of the NBF sector \nby  (i)  strengthening  the  regulatory  and  policy  framework  for  developing  viable  institutions  and \nproperly  functioning  financial  markets;  (ii)  continuing  to  strengthen  SEC\u2019s  enforcement \ncapacities,  supervisory  skills,  and  practices;  (iii)  improving  transparency  to  protect  investors \nfrom fraud, insolvency, or misconduct and (iv) facilitating the mobilization of domestic savings to \nincrease  supplies  of  funds  while  ensuring  investor  protection.  The  program  framework  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n51. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Program  will  seek  to  (i)  establish  an  effective  AML \nregime, (ii) strengthen investor protection and confidence in PSE, (iii) remove policy distortions \nthe  fragmented  regulatory  framework  to  promote  market  efficiency  and \nand  address \ndevelopment,  (iv)  clearly  define  SEC  supervisory  responsibilities  and  enhance  its  monitoring \nand  surveillance  capacity,  (v)  improve  the  quality  of  financial  information  disclosed  to  the \n\n\f 14\n\nmarket,  (vi)  strengthen  prudential  standards,  and  (vii)  promote  the  development  of  collective \ninvestment  vehicles  and  establish  the  proper  framework  for  investor  protection.  As  designed, \nthe Program would move the Philippines to full compliance with all IOSCO\u2019s 30 Objectives and \nPrinciples of Securities Regulation. \n         \nB. \n\n \nProgram Framework and Actions \n\nSome  of \n\nto  rearrange \n\nthe  agenda  suggested \n\nin  2001\u2014demutualization  of  PSE, \n\nthe  sequencing  of  reforms  relating \n\n52. \nDuring the preparation of NBFG in 2001, four agenda for policy dialogue were proposed \nfor  the  second  phase  of  the  reform  program:  (i)  implementing  demutualization  of  PSE;  (ii) \nstrengthening market regulation; (iii) strengthening market governance and compliance; and (iv) \nfacilitating  diversification  and  innovation  in  corporate  financing  (Appendix  3).  Although  the \nobjective of SNFG and the direction of the Program remain broadly in line with those suggested \nunder NBFG, its scope has been modified, enhanced, and expanded to include three additional \ncomponents,  namely,  (i)  establishing  an  effective  AML  regime,  (ii)  strengthening  prudential \nstandards  for  NBFIs,  and  (iii)  promoting  the  development  of  collective  investment  vehicles. \nBesides the three new components, a number of critical policy measures are added to enhance \nthe program content. These measures include (i) removing DST on secondary securities trading \nand the IPO tax to increase liquidity in the capital markets and encourage listing, and (ii) rules \nintended to further strengthen disclosure and prohibit actions designed to improperly influence \nauditors and so prevent accounting and corporate misconduct as recently evident in the US. \n  \n53. \nincreasing \ntransparency  in  clearing  and  settlement  of  securities  and  depository  functions,  amending  tax \nlaws  to  promote  the  development  of the  insurance  industry,  and  establishing the fixed  income \ntrading counter\u2014have been modified or excluded to reflect the current market condition and the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities,  and \nthe \nestablishment of the fixed income exchange. As a step toward demutualization, SNFG supports \nSEC\u2019s  call  for  PSE  to  develop  a  business  plan  to  broaden  ownership  of  the  exchange  as \nmandated  under  the  new  SRC  by  (i)  completing  its  asset  evaluation  as  preparation  for \ndivestiture,  (ii)  developing  a  strategy  to  achieve  self-financing,  and  (iii)  appointing  majority \nnonmember  directors  to  PSE\u2019s  selected  board  committees.  The  change  in  governance  has \nalready  taken  place  in  PSE.  Among  other  things,  the  majority  of  the  board  members  is  now \nnonbrokers and a nonbroker chairs its audit committee. This change will weaken the control of \nthe members and increase an incentive for members not to hold on to their shares. Since the \nequity market has begun to show signs of recovery since the end of May after a 2-year period of \nsharp  decline  and  the  prospect  of  recovery  will  continue  to  remain  uncertain,  it  is  considered \nmore  appropriate  for  SNFG  to  allow  flexibility  on  the  timing  of  divestiture.  Nevertheless,  SEC \nand ADB will continue to monitor the progress of PSE\u2019s demutualization.  \n \n54. \nAs  for  increased,  transparency  in  clearing  and  settlement  of  securities  and  depository \nfunctions,  scripless  trading  has  already  been  implemented  by  the  Philippines  Depository  and \nClearing Inc. (PDCI). If the fixed -income exchange is established as anticipated, PDCI plans to \nprovide  settlement  of  securities  and  depository  functions  solely  for fixed  income  trading.  PSE, \non  the  other  hand,  is  in  the  process  of  buying  its  own  settlement  and  clearing  system  for  its \ntrading  activities.  The  new  clearing  and  settlement  system  is  in  line  with  international  norms, \nand  settlement  and  clearance  procedures  at  both  PDCI  (after  the  establishment  of  the  fixed-\nincome exchange) and PSE will be subject to SEC regulations and approval.       \n \n55.  While  promoting  the  development  of the  insurance  industry  is  an  element  of  the  policy \nreforms  the  Government  would  like  to  pursue,  however,  other  legislation  with  more  pressing \npolicy  agenda\u2014rationalization  of  the  DST,  amendments to the  AML  law  and  pre-need  code\u2014\n\nto \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nhave  and  will  occupy  most  of  the  2003  and  2004  legislative  agenda  of  the  Government.  As \nsuch,  it  was  decided  that  it  would  be  more  effective  to  address  this  issue  in  future  ADB \nassistance.  Lastly,  the  Program  excludes  the  establishment  of  the  fixed  income  exchange \nstrictly  because  the  exchange  will  be  established  by  the  private  sector  and  the  more  active \ntrading of debt instruments is expected to happen once the DST on securities secondary trading \nis removed (after the DST rationalization legislation is enacted).      \n \n56. \nThe  Program  is  linked  to  NBFG  by  directly  building  on  the  foundation  established  by \nadministrative  reforms  under  NBFG  and  technical  assistance  provided  by  ADB.  As  noted  in \nparas.  16  and  17,  reforms  under  NBFG,  combined  with  ADB  technical  assistance,  helped \nestablish  some  preconditions  for  effective  securities  regulation  by  restructuring  SEC  and \nrebuilding  its  surveillance  and  enforcement  capacity.  To  ensure  that  SEC  could  function  at  its \nfull  capacity  under  the  SRC,  the  Program  will  help  complete  SEC\u2019s  administrative  reforms \nsupported  under  NBFG  by  supporting  SEC  in  further  strengthening  its  supervisory  and \nsurveillance capacity, and lay the groundwork for PSE\u2019s divestiture, while encouraging PSE to \nstrengthen  its  SRO  structure.    More  importantly,  as  SEC  is  now  in  a  better  position  to  more \neffectively monitor compliance with securities market rules and regulations, the Program will (i) \naddress  more  difficult  policy  and  regulatory  weaknesses  relating  to  taxation,  prudential \nregulations  for  both  pre-need  and  mutual  funds  industries;  and  (ii)  strengthen  financial \ndisclosure and auditing requirements to ensure more effective savings mobilization and investor \nprotection to mitigate systematic risk in the financial system.  \n \n57. \nAppendix 5 and the development policy letter (DPL) in Appendix 5. The key measures follow: \n \n\nThe  Program  with  specific  time  bound  policy  actions  proposed  for  the  SNFG  is  in \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening the Regulatory and Policy Framework for Developing Viable \nInstitutions and Properly Functioning Financial Markets \n \na. \n\nEstablishing an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n\n58. \nThe  Philippines  has  been  included  in  the  FATF  list  of  NCCT.  As  a  fundamental  step \ntoward establishment of an effective AML regime, an AML law (Republic Act 9160) was enacted \non  29  September  2001.  A  subsequent  assessment  of  the  law  by  FATF,  however,  identified \ndeficiencies, notably that the threshold for suspicious transactions was too high to constitute a \ndeterrent  to  money  laundering.  To  address  this  problem,  the  Government  promulgated \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  (IRRs)  that  attempt  to  address  some  of  the  deficiencies \ncited by FATF, but recognized that the law had to be amended to adequately meet international \nnorms.    Underscoring  its  commitment  to  establish  an  effective  AML  regime,  the  Government \nprepared  draft  amendments  to  the  law  and  worked  with  Congress  to  enact  early  in  2003 \nlegislation that is satisfactory to FATF.  \n \n59. \nEstablishing an adequate legal framework is, however, only the first step in developing \nan  effective  AML  regime.  An  institutional  structure  will  have  to  be  created  and  institutional \ncapacity built to effectively implement the law. Developing an AML institutional structure in the \nPhilippines has involved the creation of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) as the lead \nagency  in  this  area.  It  will  also  involve  designating  special  AML  courts  and  formulating  and \nformalizing the various interinstitutional relationships needed to make a functioning AML regime. \n \nDeveloping adequate institutional capacity to implement the law, on the other hand, will \n60. \nrequire  significant  resources  including  technical  support.    Specialized  capacity  will  have  to  be \nbuilt across a wide range of institutions to implement the law effectively. Support will need to be \n\n\f 16\n\nparticularly  intensive  in  the  case  of  AMLC,  where  prior  operational  experience  does  not  exist \ndomestically. A successful outcome will require the sustained involvement and support of a wide \nrange of government agencies, industry associations, and other constituencies. \n \nTo  establish  an  effective  AML  regime,  the  Program  supports  (i)  the  development  of  a \n61. \nrobust  legal  framework  that  meets  international  norms,  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  an \ninstitutional  structure  and  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity,  including  that  of  AMLC  and \nother  agencies  involved  in  implementing  the  law.  An  effective  AML  regime  is  fundamental  to \nstrengthening  investor  confidence  and  will  provide  the  Government  with  key  tools  in  its  fight \nagainst graft and corruption. ADB technical assistance on AML14 has helped AMLC achieve this \nobjective.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening  Investor  Protection  and  Confidence  in  the  Stock \nExchange \n\n \n62. \nThe  Program  calls for  PSE  to  continue  strengthening  its  own  corporate governance  by \nincluding more nonmembers in its key committees under the board of directors. An exchange, \ngoverned  by  a  board  with  a  majority  of  nonbroker  representatives  and  an  ownership  structure \nwhereby no single group of stakeholders can dominate the exchange, can be expected to act in \nthe public interest to the extent that good corporate governance can be achieved while striving \nto maximize profits for the benefit of shareholders. \n  \n63. \nThere is an urgent need for PSE to invest in new technology to upgrade its trading and \nmarket  surveillance  capability  to  improve  efficiency  and  strengthen  investor  confidence.  The \nProgram supports PSE\u2019s initiative to develop a divestiture strategy to dilute brokers\u2019 ownership, \nand to make the exchange attractive to investors (other than brokers).  \n \n64. \nTo improve PSE governance, not only in the majority of its board members nonbrokers, \nPSE\u2019s audit committee is now chaired by a nonmember. To dilute the ownership of members, \nPSE will list its shares by introduction in August 2003 and is planning to sell shares to the public \nin  2004.  SEC  and  ADB  will  continue  to  monitor  the  progress  of  PSE\u2019s  demutualization.  The \nProgram also supports SEC\u2019s call for PSE to develop an effective business plan, among other \nthings,  to  address  its  self-regulatory  responsibilities.  The  plan  should  include  a  discussion  of \nPSE\u2019s  examination  program,  compliance  with  exchange  and  SEC  rules,  market  surveillance \ncapacity, proposed penalties for violating exchange rules, and PSE committees\u2019 performance of \nSRO  functions.  A  sound  business  plan  in  respect  to  the  performance  of  SRO  functions  under \nthe  oversight  of  SEC  is  crucial  investor  protection.  The  plan  will  balance  the  interest  of  the \ninvesting public with the profit maximization interest of shareholders. Although SEC should not \nengage  in merit  regulation  with  respect to IPOs,  to  ensure  public  confidence  in  the  exchange, \nSEC will review and approve the business plan, given PSE\u2019s unique role as a SRO. \n \n\nc. \n\nRemoving Policy Distortions and Addressing a Weak Regulatory \nFramework to Promote Market Efficiency and Development \n\nTo  increase  liquidity  in  the  capital  markets  and  facilitate  the  development  of  domestic \n65. \ndebt markets, the Program supports the Government\u2019s move to work closely  with Congress to \nenact  legislation  to  rationalize  the  DST  on  securities  instruments  and  remove  the  DST  on  the \nsecond  trading  of  debt  and  equity  instruments,  including  closed-end  funds,  and  stock  lending \nand borrowing transactions. As removing the DST on secondary trading would incur substantive \n\n                                                           \n14 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Philippines for Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Regime. Manila \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nrevenue loss for the Government, the legislation has a provision that redefines debt instruments \nto include certificates or other evidences of deposits that are earning interest rates higher than \nregular savings deposits (i.e., special accounts) that have been DST exempt. The new definition \nwill  give  equal  tax  treatment  to  securities  instruments  and  bank  deposits  and  allow  the \nGovernment to expand the DST base. The legislation will not only help increase liquidity in the \nequity  market  but  also  encourage  secondary  trading  of  debt  instruments  and  facilitate  the \nestablishment  of  the  fixed  income  exchange.  The  Program  also  recommends  that  the \nGovernment initiate steps to eliminate the IPO tax on listed securities (i.e., corporate stocks and \nclosed-end investment companies) to encourage more listing.  \n \n66. \nReducing  taxation  of  secondary  market  transactions  in  financial  instruments  as \nrecommended under this Program will certainly remove a major impediment to the development \nof efficient financial markets. However, it must be emphasized that overall tax collection is low \nand the tax base should be expanded to reduce fiscal deficits and ensure fiscal sustainability. \nThis  is  particularly  crucial  for  strengthening  investor  confidence  needed  for  developing  the \ncapital markets and to place the Philippines in a position to compete in the evolving regional and \nglobal financial markets. \n \n67.  While  the  Program  is  based  on  the  medium-term  framework for  the  NBF sector  and  is \nexpected to help address immediate policy impediments/constraints to the development of the \nsector, it strongly recommends that SEC fully develop this framework into a long-term strategy \nfor developing capital markets. The strategy will serve to advise top-level policy makers on the \nmajor development goals in the sector and how the Government may facilitate achievement of \nthe goals, as well as additional constraints (i.e., tax, and regulatory and legal impediments) to \ncapital market development, taking into account the need to achieve greater market efficiency. \nThe strategy will also make recommendations on how to attract external investment in a highly \ncompetitive global capital market, and to achieve greater investor protection in a cost-effective \nmanner  in  line  with  international  best  practice  and  the  mandate  of  the  laws  administered  by \nSEC.  \n\n2. \n\nFurther Strengthening SEC Supervisory and Surveillance Capacity \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nTo further strengthen SEC\u2019s supervisory and surveillance capacity to meet the principles \n68. \nand objectives of IOSCO, the Program calls for SEC to upgrade its MIS to enable it to gather \nand  analyze  databases  for  monitoring  and  surveillance  purposes.  With  ADB  technical \nassistance, SEC is training its own staff in market surveillance, enforcement, and compliance in \nline with its new mandate under the SRC.  \n \n69. \nTo  avoid  potential  gaps  in  separate  on-site  inspections  and  to  allow  the  use  of  SEC\u2019s \nexpertise in respect to capital market transactions and underwriting activities, the Program also \nrecommends  that  SEC  and  BSP  amend  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  BSP  and \nSEC to (i) provide an action plan and procedures for joint on-site inspections of dually regulated \nentities to minimize cost of supervision, while ensuring that regulatory gaps do not occur; and (ii) \nstandardize the regulatory and operational reports filed with BSP and SEC. Furthermore, SEC is \nencouraged  to  review  and  update  its  existing  inspection  procedures  and  allow  for  SEC-PSE \njoint on-site examination of PSE member brokers and dealers on a sample basis or in respect to \ncause or thematic examinations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 18\n\n3. \n\nImproving  Transparency  to  Protect  Investors  from  Fraud,  Insolvency,  or \nMisconduct \n\n \n70. \nInternational  best  practices  in  regulation  and  governance  emphasize  that  information \ndisclosure and transparency are important so that investors, counterparties to transactions, and \nother stakeholders can evaluate the financial conditions of a regulated financial institution as an \nadded  safeguard  to  supplement  those  provided  by  government  oversight  in  the  form  of \nprudential  standards,  on-site  inspections,  and  off-site  monitoring  of  financial  and  operational \nreports. The Program calls for SEC to phase -in on its web site the public disclosure of annual \naudited  financial  information  for  all  registered  NBFIs  for  public  viewing.  Currently,  all  SEC \nregistered NBFIs are required to file with SEC an annual audited financial statement, which is \navailable for public inspection.  SEC performs the corporate registration function, but it does not \nmaintain  a  full  service  branch  office  network  whereby  investors  could  view  public  documents \nfiled with SEC.  \n \n71. \nThe  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  undertaking  to  move  away  from  Philippines \nGAAP  to  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS).  All  public  companies  registered  with  SEC \nare  required  to comply  with  IAS  rather than  with  the  Philippines  GAAP  by  2005.    Accordingly, \nthere is a need to train accounting professionals and auditors in the use of IAS. With ongoing \nADB  assistance,15  the  SEC  with  the  Board  of  Accountancy  (BOA)  is  implementing  a \ncomprehensive training program for adopting IAS.  \n \n72. \nIn  light  of the  recent  accounting  scandal  in  the  US,  there  is  now  renewed  emphasis  in \nboth developed and emerging financial markets on the need to reform auditing practices and to \npromote  stronger  corporate  governance  in  selecting  and  retaining  of  external  independent \nauditors  for  listed  companies.  The  Program  intends  to  improve  the  quality  of  disclosed \ninformation  and  to  raise  public  confidence  by  strengthening  financial  disclosure  and  audit \npractices. It specially calls for SEC to issue a regulation requiring the chief executive officer and \nchief financial officer of listed companies, or persons performing similar functions, to disclose to \nthe  issuer\u2019s  auditors  and  to  the  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  (i)  all  significant \ndeficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect its ability to \nrecord, process, and report financial data; and (ii) any fraud that involves management or other \nemployees who have a significant role in internal controls.  \n \n73. \nEffective January 2003, SEC will take effective disciplinary actions\u2014 including revoking \nthe  accreditation  of  noncompliant  auditors\u2014against  issuers  and  other  NBFIs  or  auditors  for \nsignificant  violation  of  established  accounting  standards  and  rules.  In  addition,  the  Program \nrecommends  that  Board  of  Accountancy,  which  is  responsible  for  establishing  auditing  and \naccounting  standards  in  the  Philippines,  to  adopt  the  code  of  ethics  in  harmony  with \ninternational  best  practice  such  as  that  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants.  The \nProgram also recommends that SEC require all listed companies to rotate auditors at least once \nevery 5 years to ensure independent and quality audits.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n                                                           \n15 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Strengthening Regulation and Market Governance, the Accounting and \n\nAuditing Component. Manila \n\n\f19\n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nStrengthening Prudential Standards for NBFIs \n\nRisk-Based Capital Standards \n\na. \n \n\nb. \n \n\nThe  Program  recommends  that  the  capital  requirements  of  investments  houses, \n74. \ngovernment securities dealers, and securities brokers and dealers be risk-based and in harmony \nwith international best practices, taking into account position risk for all dealer activities of securities \nmarket intermediaries engaged in trading and investment, market-making, and/or firm commitment \nunderwriting.  Under  IOSCO's  best  practice  framework,  capital  standards  for  securities  market \nintermediaries  (i.e.,  brokers,  dealers,  and  underwriters)  take  the  following  form:  (i)  liquidity  and \nsolvency should be covered; (ii) mark-to-market principles should be employed; and (iii) risk-based \nrequirements  should  cover  all  risks  of  the  firm,  and,  in  particular  should  contain  (a)  a  base \nrequirement  reflecting the  scale of a firm's  activities  to  capture  nonmeasurable  risks; (b)  position \nrisk requirements reflecting price volatility of individual securities, with provisions for concentrated \npositions  and  allowance  for  risk  reduction  measures  such  as  hedging;  and  (c)  settlement  of \ncounterparty risk requirements reflecting the risk of nonperformance in a timely manner.  \n \n\nFit and Proper Standards \n\n75. \n The  Program  calls  for  SEC  to  submit  to  Congress  amendments  to  the  SRC  to  enable \nSEC  to  establish \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d  standards for  officers  and  directors  of regulated  entities (i.e., \nbroker-dealers, listed companies, investment companies, investment advisors), comparable with \nthose  in  the  Banking  Act  whereby  SEC  will  be  able  to  prescribe,  pass  upon,  and  review  the \nqualifications and disqualifications of appointed individuals or elected directors or officers, and \ndisqualify those found unfit to serve. \n\nc. \n\nCertification of Compliance Officer \n\n \n76. \nThe  Program  recommends  that  all  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  investment  houses, \nfinance  companies,  and  investment  companies  be  required  to  have  a  compliance  officer \ncertified  by  examination  to  ensure  understanding  of  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  including \nprudential standards, financial and operational reports required by the regulator, sales practices, \nand other safeguards to protect investors. This requirement is crucial as the compliance officer \nwill  have  a  major  responsibility  for  preventing,  detecting,  and  resolving  problems  before  they \nrise to the level of rules violations. To have an effective compliance program, the Program calls \nfor SEC, together with BSP, to develop and implement a training and certification program for \ncompliance officers.  \n \n\n5. \n\nFacilitating  Mobilization  of  Domestic  Savings  to  Increase  Supplies  of \nInvestment Funds While Ensuring Investor Protection \n\n      \n\nTo  facilitate  mobilization  of  domestic  savings  and  ensure  investor  protection,  the \n\n \n77. \nProgram focuses on supporting the pre-needs and mutual funds industries. \n \n \n \n78. \nTo ensure plan holder protection and the solvency of pre-need companies, the Program \nfirst calls for the Government to submit the proposed pre-need code to Congress for approval. \nTo strengthen public confidence and minimize losses to plan holders in the event of insolvency, \nthe  proposed  code  would  provide  a  broad  mandate  to  the  regulator  of  pre-need  plans  to \n\nPre-Need Plans \n\na. \n\n\f 20\n\nestablish  an  investor  protection  scheme  with  the  details  of  fund  operation  and  coverage \ndetermined  by  the  regulator for  the  protection  of  pre-need  policy-holders.  Given  that  pre-need \nproducts  partake  of  the  nature  of  insurance  products,  the  proposed  code  would  transfer  the \nregulatory and supervisory function of the industry from SEC to IC. Meanwhile, to ensure plan \nholders\u2019 protection, the Program stresses that SEC should order pre-need plan companies that \nfail to comply with the SEC regulation on trust fund deficits to cease or desist from selling new \nplans.  \n \nSecond, the  Program recommends that  industry  sales  practices  must  be  reviewed  and \n79. \nadvertising  practices  brought  under  closer  supervisory  control  issuing  more  comprehensive \nregulatory guidelines on advertising.  The Program stresses a regulatory review of advertising, \neither by the government regulator or through the creation of an SRO for the pre-need sector.  \nThe  Program  also  calls  for  the  supervisory  agency  of  the  pre-need  companies  to  issue \ncomprehensive  guidelines  on  pre-need  advertisement  and  announce  that  it  will  conduct \nthorough on-site, unscheduled inspections of pre-need companies at least once every 3 years.   \n \nThird,  the  Program  recommends  that  the  supervisory  agency  strengthen  the  role  of \n80. \nindependent  directors  in  pre-need  companies  given  the  importance  of  public  trust  in  the \nindustry. In addition, the Program calls for the regulatory agency to develop an examination and \ncertification  program  for  an  officer  designated  as  compliance  officer.  The  compliance  officer \nmust  be  knowledgeable  in  the  laws  and  regulations  and  compliance  applicable  to  pre-need \ncompanies  and  have  a  sound  knowledge  of  best  practices  in  corporate  governance  and  the \nfiduciary obligations of the pre-need company and trustee to the plan holders.     \n \n\n b. \n\nMutual Funds \n\n \n81. \nThe  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  move  to  submit  the  RICA  for  enactment  to \nreplace  the  outdated  ICA.  Among  other  things,  the  RICA  would  allow  greater  competition  and \ngreater market entry by removing the requirement that all board directors for mutual funds must \nbe  Filipinos;  raising  the  minimum  paid-up  capital  requirement  for  mutual  fund  companies \nsignificantly to ensure that only financially viable companies can engage in the business, which \ndepends  on  maintenance  of  public  confidence;  establishing  investment  standards  for  mutual \nfunds  to  avoid  potential  conflicts  of  interest  and  abuses;  and  increasing  penalties  for  violating \ncertain provisions. \n  \n82. \nThe  Program  stresses that  corporate governance of  investment  companies  must  also  be \nimproved  by  strengthening  the  fiduciary  obligations  of  the  board  of  directors  with  respect  to \nmanagement  and  the  performance  of  quasi-regulatory  self-policing  functions.  The  Program  also \ncalls for SEC to require that a majority of the board of directors be independent directors within 2 \nyears of the enactment of the RICA, and to strengthen corporate governance by requiring that at \nleast one officer or director pass an examination related to operational and regulatory compliance, \nincluding  applying  rules and regulations for safekeeping  and  valuation  of fund assets.  Significant \nrelated party transactions, as defined by SEC, which management proposes to enter into should \nalso require the approval of shareholders. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n21\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Source of Funds, Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n\nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a loan of \n83. \n$150 million. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  rates  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank borrowing offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility and a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum in accordance with standard terms for program loans. A front-end fee will be payable \nin an amount equal to 0.50% of the amount of the loan. ADB will be entitled to withdraw and pay \non  behalf  of  the  Government  the  front-end  fee  from  the  loan  account.  The  loan  will  have  an \namortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years.  The  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected to be used over a period of 36 months from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n84. \nThe  proposed  loan  size  is  based  on  the  estimated  short-  to  medium-term  costs  of  the \nreform  program,  the  strength  of  the  Program,  and  the  relative  importance  of  the  sector.16  The \nadjustment costs are not easily quantifiable, however, the direct and more obvious adjustment \ncosts amount to about $200 million. They include the following. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninterest  groups  who  are  strongly  opposed \n\nTo  establish  an  effective  AML  regime,  the  Government  had  to  overcome \nto  FATF \nsignificant  vested \nrequirements. The Government also has to shoulder a financial burden relating to \nthe  physical  establishment  and  operation  of  a  financial  intelligence  unit  (e.g., \noffice space, personnel costs, and specialized information technology (IT) system \nand  related  training  to  support  the  FIU's  transaction  monitoring  functions). \nSpecialized training in combating money laundering and enforcing the AML has \nto  be  extended  across  a  range  of  other  Government  agencies.  Estimated  cost: \n$25 million over the next 5 years.  \n\nAt the same time, SEC, IC, and BSP have to build their capacity to monitor and \nsupervise  NBFIs  to  prevent  money  laundering  in  the  financial  sector.  This \nincludes  developing  AML  manuals  and  training  programs  for  NBFIs  and  banks \nand upgrading IT systems in supervisory agencies to support implementation of \nstrengthened regulatory, reporting, and disclosure requirements. Estimated cost: \n$5 million over the next 3 years. \n\nTo adopt IAS, the Government has to develop curricula and textbooks for public \nuniversities,  retrain  accounting  and  auditing  professionals  at  public  universities \nand colleges, and are currently employed  in the public sector. The Government \nwill have to upgrade its IT systems throughout the country and retrain regulators \nto  ensure  that  they  are  equipped  to  enforce  the  new  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards  and  other  financial  disclosure  requirements.  Estimated  cost:  $10 \nmillion over the next 5 years. \n\n(iv) \n\nTo  adopt  risk-based  prudential  regulations,  SEC  will  have  develop  a  training \nprogram  for  NBFIs  to  comply  with  the  regulations,  and  develop  a  monitoring \nsystem to ensure compliance. Estimated cost: $2 million.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n16  Review of ADB Program Lending Policies, 3 July 1996. \n\n\f 22\n\n(v) \n\n \n\nTo  rationalize  the  DST  and  remove  it  from  the  secondary  trading  of  securities, \nthere  would  be  significant  revenue  losses  immediately  after  the  passage  of  the \nDST  legislation.  The  loss  could  range  from  $10million  to  $35  million  annually \nover  3  years.  Estimated  cost:  $30 million  to  $105  million  over  the  next  3  years, \ndepending on performance of the equity market. \n\n(vi) \n\nTo  support  a  protection  scheme  for  pre-need  plan  holders,  there  would  be  an \nestimated cost of $50 million to the Government. \n\n \n85. \nThe  private  sector  will  also  incur  adjustment  costs  for  complying  with  AML,  financial \ndisclosure (including IAS), and stricter prudential regulations. These costs may be less obvious; \nhowever,  they  are  likely  to  be  significant.  This,  together  with  the  enactment  of  politically \nsensitive  amendments  to  the  AML  law,  has  made  it  difficult  for  the  Government  to  build \nconsensus on implementing the reforms.  \n \n86. \nNevertheless,  given  the  importance  of  the  sector,  the  costs  of  not  implementing  the \nreforms would be much more significant to the economy as a whole. The sector would continue \nto be ineffective in mobilizing savings to finance needed investments to finance growth; NBFIs \nwould remain vulnerable to systemic risks, and investors to fraud and misconduct. In particular, \nthe costs of not establishing an effective AML regime would be devastating as the Philippines \nwould  be  subject  to  countermeasures  by  FATF.  The  countermeasures  would  stop  trade  and \nfinancial flows to the Philippines and cause major macroeconomic instability. \n   \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n87. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency for the SNFG program \nloan  and  SEC  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  SEC  will  set  up  an  interagency  coordination \ncommittee headed by the chairperson of SEC and comprising representatives from AMLC, BSP, \nDOF,  IC,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority,  and  PSE.  The  committee  will  meet \nevery quarter to coordinate and ensure the effective implementation of the proposed reforms.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedure \n\n88. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, other than items specified in the list of ineligible items \nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources (Appendix 7). The Government \nwill  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n89. \nThe Government will use the local currency funds generated by the SNFG loan to meet \nprogram  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of  reform  and  to  help  maintain  current  levels  of \nsocial expenditures. \n \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\nThe program period will be 3 years. The loan will be released in two tranches. The first \n90. \ntranche ($75 million) will be released upon loan effectiveness. The Government plans to meet \nall  the  second  tranche  conditions  for  its  release  in  18  months  from  ADB  approval  of  the  loan. \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nThe conditions for release of the first tranche include 37 policy actions all of which have already \nbeen fully complied with (Appendix 5). The second tranche ($75 million) will be released upon \nsatisfactory compliance with 13 policy conditions. The second tranche conditions follow: \n\n(i)  Certain courts to be designated to hear and adjudicate money laundering cases. \n\n(ii)  The Government will complete formulating the AML implementation plan mutually \n\nsatisfactory to ADB and the Government. \n\n(iii)  The Government to promulgate IRRs for the AML Act as amended in 2003. \n\n(iv)  AMLC will establish a transaction monitoring system. \n\n(v)  AMLC will engage at least 40 professional staff with suitable qualifications to carry \n\nout AMLC\u2019s responsibilities effectively. \n\n(vi)  AMLC to develop and adopt an AML compliance system satisfactory to ADB. \n\n(vii)  SEC  will  sign  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  with  PSE  regarding \n\nimplementation of a business plan for PSE\u2019s self-regulation. \n\n(viii)  SEC  and  BSP  will  amend  the  MOU  between  the  two  agencies  to  (a)  provide  an \naction plan and procedures for joint on-site inspections of dually regulated entities, \nwhere  necessary,  to  minimize  cost  of  supervision  while  ensuring  that  regulatory \ngaps do not occur; and (b) standardize the regulatory and operational reports filed \nwith BSP and SEC. \n\n(ix)  SEC to commence the public disclosure, on its website, of annual audited financial \nstatements  and  information  so  as  to  eventually  cover  all  registered  nonbank \nfinancial institutions. \n\n(x)  SEC  to  require  the  auditors  of  all  nonbank  financial  institutions  registered  with \nBSP, SEC, or IC to report serious breaches of accounting standards to the relevant \nregulator  in  the  event  the  company  fails  to  make  public  disclosure  of  such \ninformation. \n\n(xi)  The Professional Regulatory Commission will, in coordination with BOA adopt the \ncode  of  ethics  in  harmony  with  international  best  practice,  such  as  that  of  the \nInternational Federation of Accountants. \n\n(xii)  SEC  will  establish  a  system  for  monitoring  and  enforcing  compliance  with \naccounting  requirements  for  all  listed  companies  (and  other  NBFIs)  or  auditors, \nincluding an arrangement for conducting investigations or special examinations to \nsubstantiate information provided by issuers/listed companies or auditors. \n\n(xiii)  SEC,  in  coordination  with  BSP  where  appropriate,  will  issue  risk-based  capital \nstandards  for  registered  brokers,  dealers  and  investment  houses  with  minimum \nentry  requirements,  and  ongoing  risk-based  capital  standards  for  securities \nbrokers,  dealers,  and  investment  houses.  The  minimum  capital  requirement  and \nthe  ongoing  capital  requirement  will  be  based  on  the  risk  of  conducting  the \nbusiness  of  brokers,  dealers,  underwriters,  and  related  business  activities,  as \nappropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 24\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \n91. \nThe technical assistance (TA) will (i) assist the Government in preparing a medium-term \nand long-term strategy to advance reforms and further develop the NBF sector, and (ii) promote \ncompetition  and  remove  impediments  to  the  creation  and  distribution  of  innovative  financial \nproducts and services (Appendix 8).  To achieve these objectives, the proposed TA will focus on \n \n\nincreasing the efficiency of the domestic capital markets and reducing the cost of \nfunds mobilization to have a viable alternative to external sources of funding; \n\nstrengthening regulation, supervision, and governance while removing legal and \nregulatory  impediments  to  the  development  of  the  NBF  sector  and  capital \nmarkets; \n\nensuring  compliance  with  international  best  practices  in  securities  regulation  as \nmeasured by IOSCO;  \n\nformulating a medium-term (3-5 years) and long-term (10 years) strategy for the \ndeveloping the capital markets and NBF sector; \n\npromoting competition in the NBF sector and removing impediments to creating \nand distributing innovative financial products and services; and \n\nestablishing  a  high-level  regulatory  council \nto  harmonize  prudential  and \nregulatory  standards  and  supervisory  practices  and  to  consider  policy  actions, \nthat  may  be  needed  for  fairness  in  respect  to  regulating  and  taxing  similar \nfinancial products and services.   \n\n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $715,000  equivalent,  comprising  $445,000  as  foreign \n92. \nexchange and $270,000 equivalent as local currency. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $55,000 equivalent \nof  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram. The  Government  will  provide  $215,000  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office \nfacilities, and workshops. The TA will last for 8 months starting in October 2003 and ending in \nJune 2004. The TA is estimated to require 15 person-months of consulting support: 10 person-\nmonths  international  and  5  person-months  domestic.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  individually  through  the  biodata-based \nselection and on quality- and cost-based arrangements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe  Program  will  help  promote  the  development  of  the  NBF  sector  by  strengthening \n93. \ninvestor  protection,  ensuring  financial  solvency  of  financial  institutions,  and  preventing  the \nspread  of  systemic  risks  in  the  financial  sector.  By  strengthening  the  regulatory  and  policy \nframework  for  developing  viable  and  properly  functioning  financial  markets,  the  Program  will \nassist the Government to establish a more effective AML regime. As these activities generally \nstem  from  corruption  and  other  forms  of  criminal  activities,  the  Program  will  not  only  help \nremove the Philippines from the NCCT list and avoid counter-measures but also strengthen the \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nGovernment\u2019s  legitimacy  and  investor  confidence  in  the  Philippines  in  general  and  in  the \nfinancial  sector  in  particular.  Second,  the  Program  will  help  establish  a  framework  for \nbroadening  ownership  of  the  PSE  and  improve  its  governance  structure  as  well  as  establish \neffective  conditions  for  improved  PSE  self-regulation.  These  policy  measures  are  crucial  to \nprevent  fraud,  inside  trading,  and  other  forms  of  misconduct  by  market  participants  and  to \nstrengthen investor confidence in the equity market. In light of the BW inside trading scandal in \n2000, it would be impossible to promote the sustainable development of the sector unless more \neffective measures to prevent misconduct are established.  \n \n94. \nAnd  importantly,  the  Program  will  increase  liquidity  in  both  equity  and  bond  markets. \nWith  the  removal  of  the  DST  on  the  secondary  trading  of  debt  and  equity  instruments,  the \nProgram  will  significantly  facilitate  and  reduce  the  cost  of  trading  of  equity  and  fixed  income \ninstruments  in  the  secondary  markets.  This  will  encourage  more  secondary  trading  of  both \nbonds and equities, making it easier and cheaper for companies to raise funds for investment \nthrough IPOs and bond issuance.  Additionally, as the Program calls for strengthening of public \ncompanies\u2019  financial  disclosure  that  is  material  to  investment  decisions,  it  will  require  public \ncompanies  to  make  avail  of  more  accurate  financial  information  enabling  investors  to  better \nassess the potential risks and rewards of their own investments. More accurate information will \nmake it easier for the capital markets to attract and mobilize savings for businesses\u2019 productive \ninvestment.  Furthermore,  by  calling  the  SEC  to  rationalize  and  strengthen  the  capital \nrequirement of NBFIs based on market and credit risks, and in harmony with international best \npractice,  the  Program  will  (i)  ensure  the  financial  stability  of  NBFIs  and  thereby  prevent  the \nspread of systemic risks; and (ii) protect investors, as NBFIs will have be solvent to be allowed \nto operate and engage in the securities business.  \n \n95. \n Lastly,  the  Program  will  help  develop  the  capital  markets  by  opening  up  the  mutual \nfunds  industry  to  a  wide  variety  of  foreign  investment  companies  and  establishing  a  proper \nregulatory framework that will ensure investor protection and the solvency of both pre-need plan \nand  investment  companies.  Competition  from  foreign  investment  companies  will  not  only \nprovide  investors  with  greater  investment  opportunities  but  indirectly  force  existing  investment \nfirms  to  improve  their  performance  and  services  to  prevent  loss  of  market  shares,  further \nbenefiting  investors.  On  other  hand,  an  improved  regulatory  framework  will  help  mobilize \nfor  business \nsavings\u2014increasing \ninvestment,  as  investors  will  be  confident  that  their  investment  in  both  mutual  funds  and  pre-\nneed plan companies will be safe. \n  \nB. \n\nfunds\u2014and  channel \n\nthe  supply  of \n\ninvestment \n\nImpacts \n\nthem \n\n96. \nThe detailed poverty impact assessment of the Program is in Appendix 9. The Program \nextends and deepens the reforms under NBFG. As a whole the Program is pro-poor in its direct \nimpact  in  the  short  run  and  pro-poor  in  its  indirect  impact  in  the  short  and  medium  term.  The \nProgram focuses on measures to increase investor protection and confidence so as to mobilize \nsavings  for  productive  investment  through  the  capital  markets.  Such  measures  are  needed  to \nrestore growth, generate tax revenues for investment in social and physical infrastructure in the \nmedium  and  long-  term,  and  create  jobs  to  absorb  the  rapidly  growing  labor  market.  The \nProgram also focuses on measures to indirectly strengthen social protection and to protect pre-\nneed policyholders comprising primarily middle- and low-income households.   \n  \n\n97. \nThe  environmental  implications  of  the  program  loan  were  assessed.  By  its  nature,  the \nproposed Program will not have any direct or immediate environmental impacts. Any link of the \n\n\f 26\n\npolicy  interventions  to  any  indirect  environmental  impacts,  whether  beneficial  or  adverse,  is \ntenuous.  In  this  case,  indirect  environmental  impacts  are  difficult  to  forecast  because  of  the \nuncertainties  relating  to  the  financial  market\u2019s  response  to  the  policy  interventions,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  effectively  integrate  environmental  considerations  into  economic  policy \nand regulation. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nOne  of  the  principal  risks  associated  with  the  Program  is  the  resistance  of  vested \n98. \ninterests,  particularly  as  the  Program  is  politically  sensitive,  seeking  to  end  money-laundering \nactivities. To minimize the risks, the policy actions have been formulated to cover reforms that \nare  within  the  executive  branch  of  the  Government  to  implement.  The  more  difficult  reforms \nrequiring  the  enactment  of  politically  sensitive  legislation,  including  the  passage  of  the \namendments to the AML act are included in the Program as a first-tranche condition to prevent \nthe possible delay in enacting legislations from affecting the implementation of other significant \nreforms  supported  under  the  Program.  The  Government  has  also  shown  political  will  to \nimplement the Program; for example, despite resistance, the amendments to AML satisfactory \nto FATF were passed by Congress in March 2003. \n \n99. \nApart from politically sensitive legislation, the Program will also impose significant costs \nto the private sector, particularly as firms will be required to adopt IAS. While large accounting \nfirms  are  likely  to  be  able  to  more  easily  adopt  the  required  changes,  smaller  firms  will  have \ngreater  difficulty  and  less  resource  for  staff  retraining.  Likewise,  there  will  also  be  costs  to  all \ncompanies  registered  with  SEC  as  they  will  be  required  to  change  from  Philippines  GAAP  to \nIAS as their staff will have to be retrained to meet the new reporting requirements. The Program \nrecognizes the difficulty and costs associated with the changes and has made provision for the \nGovernment  to  adopt the  new  accounting  standards  on  a gradual  basis  until  2005.   While  the \ntransition  is  relatively  shorter  than  that  in  the  European  Union,  the  risks  are  viewed  as \nadequately  mitigated  because  the  Philippines  has  a  large  pool  of  well-qualified  accountants, \nmaking the transition easier than in many emerging markets.     \n  \n100.  Lastly,  as  indicated  in  para.72,  with  the  Program  calling  for  SEC  to  adopt  risk-based \ncapital  standards  for  NBFIs,  there  will  be  significant  costs  to  NBFIs  in  meeting  the  new \nrequirements. A large number of NBFIs are likely to be required to raise their capital to match \nthe  risks  on  their  balance  sheet  and  as  such  are  expected  to  raise  strong  objections  to  the \nreforms. Nevertheless, the objections are likely to be overcome as similar reforms have already \nbeen implemented in the banking sector. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n101. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, \nas  described  in  the  DPL,  will  continue  in  effect for  the  duration  of the  Program; \nand  \n\n \n(ii)  The Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nincluded  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the  DPL  and  the  Loan  Agreement  to \nensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nProgram. \n\n\f27\n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n102. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $150,000,000 to \nthe  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Second  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  Program  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  loan  facility,  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n\n                                                                                                    JOHN LINTJER  \n       Vice-President \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12 August 2003 \n \n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 1\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nMutual Funds \n\n \nA. \n \nUnder  the  Investment  Company  Act,  26  investment  companies  are  registered  with  the \n1. \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  Two  classes  of  investment  companies  are \npermitted  in  the  Philippines:  open-end  funds  (i.e.,  mutual  funds)  and  closed-end  funds.  Mutual \nfunds are referred to as \"open-end\" funds because they are set up to continually offer new shares \nto  the  public.  Closed-end  funds,  on  the  other  hand,  offer  only  a  fixed  number  of  shares.  The \nnumber  of  shares  offered  by  a  closed-end  fund  is  determined  at  the  time  of  the  initial  public \noffering. Closed-end funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder, but rather trade \nlike  any  other  listed  stock  with  the  price  determined  on  the  basis  of  supply  and  demand.  In  the \nPhilippines,  mutual  funds  are  sponsored  by  securities  broker-dealers  (4),  insurance  companies \n(9),  banks  (2),  the  GSIS  (1),  and  others  (6).  Although  only  two  mutual  funds  are  sponsored  by \nbanks, but they account for about 52% of the industry assets of P25.8 billion. In contrast, the nine \nmutual funds sponsored by insurance companies are smaller, accounting for about 43% of mutual \nfunds industry assets at year-end 2002.1   \n \n2. \nBoth  mutual  funds  and  closed-end  funds  offer  important  advantages  to  investors:  (i) \nprofessional money management, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) economies of scale. Among \nthe  currently  active  mutual  funds,  the  first  was  established  in  February  1991.  As  a  result  of  the \ndemise of mutual funds in the 1970s, no new funds were approved for more than a decade. The \nonly  closed-end  fund  was  listed  on  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE)  in  September  1995.2  \nClosed-end  funds,  like  other  newly  listed  companies,  are  subject  to  a  4%  initial  public  offerings \n(IPO) tax. This is a disincentive to listing new closed-end funds on the PSE.3    \n \n3. \nIn  terms  of  size,  the  Philippines  investment  company  industry  is  among  the  smallest  in \nAsia. The net asset value of Philippine investment companies accounts for less than 1% of  equity \nmarket capitalization. In the Philippines, investors are not well informed about the capital markets \nin general and about funds in particular. Thus, there is a clear need to educate the public about \ninvestment opportunities. Also, mutual fund investors are faced with several layers of taxes, which \nplace them at a disadvantage relative to bank deposits and common trust funds.4 Moreover, BSP \npolicy does not permit the use of bank personnel and premises to distribute fund shares. Based \non  the  experience  of  other  countries,  the  potential  for  mutual  funds  as  an  investment  vehicle  is \nsignificant.  In  particular,  mutual  funds  are  well  suited  to  small  investors,  individual  retirement \naccounts,  and  as  an  investment  vehicle  for  private  pension  plans.  In  the  United  States  (US),  in \nparticular, the rapid growth of mutual funds has been facilitated by the enactment of legislation on \n\n1  A Strategic vision: Strengthening Philippines Mutual Funds and Improving the Public's Perception of Them, AGILE, \n\nCirculation Draft, Manila, March 10, 1999, pp. 15-18.\n\n2  Lorayes,  Roberto  Zimmerman.  \"Mutual  Fund  Industry  in  the  Philippines,\"  Philippine  Financial  Almanac,  1997/1998, \n\npage 52.\n\n3  It is noteworthy that when the US Investment Company Act was passed in 1940, the dominant form of organization for \ninvestment  companies  was  the  closed-end  fund  whose  shares  are  not  redeemable  at  the  option  of  the  investor. \nToday,  the  US  securities  market  is  deep  and  liquid.  Open-end  funds  now  account  for  95%  of  the  US  investment \ncompany industry assets.\n\n4  Mutual  funds  are  subject  to  the  following  taxes: (i) DST on original share issuance of P2/P200; (ii) one- half of 1% \nstock  transactions  tax;  (iii)  capital  gains  tax  on  unlisted  shares  held  in  portfolio;  (iv) tax on dividends received from \ndomestic  corporations;  and  (v)  corporate  income  tax.  See:  Policy  Matrix  presented  to  Department  of  Finance  re: \nPension Reform and the Context of the Contractual Savings Debate in the Philippines - Policy of Matrix of Issues and \nConcerns (June 1999). \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n29\n\nthe regulation of employer-sponsored private pension plans in the 1970s, and more recently, by \nthe introduction of individual retirement accounts including IRAs and 401k plans.   \n  \n \n4. \nA  mutual  fund  can  invest  the  funds  of  shareholders  in  a  wide  array  of  liquid  financial \ninstruments  including  stocks,  Government  bonds,  corporate  bonds,  and  money  market \ninstruments such as treasury bills and commercial papers. According to investment objectives, \nthe  Philippines  has  four  types  of  mutual  funds:  (i)  equity  fund,  (ii)  balanced  fund,  (iii)  fixed \nincome, and (iv) money market (Table 1.1).    \n\n \nTable A1.1:  Number and Net Assets of All Operating Companiesa \n\n   1999                     2000                  2001                 2002 \n\n(No.) \n\nNet Assets \n\nCompanies \n\nFund Objective \n\nMoney Market \n\nBond Funds \n\nBalanced Funds  \n\nEquity Funds \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n1,751 \n\n1,998 \n\n1,799 \n\n5,548 \n\n \n\n2,909 \n\n1,704 \n\n1,516 \n\n6,129 \n\n      61 \n\n8,460 \n\n1,555 \n\n1,500 \n\n         9 \n\n23,500 \n\n1,158 \n\n1,142 \n\n11,576 \n\n25,809 \n\n1 \n\n6 \n\n10 \n\n5 \n\n22 \n\na Investment Companies of the Philippines \nSource:  Investment Company Association of the Philippines. \n\n \n \n5. \nIn  the  Philippines,  only  a  few  debt  instruments  are  available  for  investment  and  the \nsecondary  market  for  debt  instruments  is  not  active.  In  the  absence  of  a  liquid  secondary \nmarket,  it  can  be  difficult  for  a  mutual  fund  to  meet  investors'  demand  for  redemption.  In  the \nUS,  for  example,  regulations  require  that  at  least  85%  of  fund  assets  be  invested  in  liquid \nsecurities.  Although liquidity is not specifically defined in the regulations, the ability to liquidate \na security position in 7 business days is normally considered appropriate.     \n \n6. \nBusiness Risk Factors.  For investment companies, three types of risk are apparent:  (i) \nmarket  risk,  liquidity  risk,  and  operational  risk.  Emerging  markets  are  volatile  and  sometimes \nilliquid. Nevertheless, the net asset value of the fund must be computed each day. The method of \ncomputing  earnings  and  asset  values  must  be  fair  and  correct  and  in  compliance  with  SEC \nregulations. The mutual fund also has an obligation to accurately value net assets and promptly \nmeet the liquidity needs of fund shareholders. As the size of the industry grows, however, it may \nbecome increasingly difficult to meet investors' demands for redemption unless efforts are made \nto  create  deeper  and  more  liquid  secondary  markets  in  both  debt  and  equity  securities.  In \nparticular, efforts to improve the operational efficiency of the debt securities market will reduce risk \nexposure to the mutual funds. Finally, there are operational risks associated with the safekeeping \nof  funds  and  securities  held  in  custody  for  the  benefit  of  shareholders.  With  regard  to  risk \nmanagement and investor protection, the board of directors has important fiduciary obligations to \nfund shareholders. The fund must be managed for the benefit of the shareholders in accordance \nwith the objectives disclosed to investors in the fund's registration statement.  \n \nCapital and Prudential Standards. A minimum capital requirement of at least P50 million \n7. \nis  required  per  investment  company.  However,  SEC  could  grant  a  lower  subscribed  and paid-in \ncapital requirement for investment companies that belong to a group under management by the \nsame investment company manager (in the Investment Company Act (ICA), the minimum capital \nrequirement  is  set  at  P500,000).  Prior  to  offering  shares  to  the  public,  an  investment  company \nmust  file  an  initial  registration  statement  with  SEC.  The  investment  company's  prospectus  is \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 1\n\nrequired  to  provide  full  and  fair  disclosure  of  material  information  about  the  company  to \nshareholders as required under Revised Securities Act and the Corporate Code. Under SEC's full \ndisclosure program, they must also file an initial registration statement, an annual audited report, \nand quarterly reports.5 Investment companies may not change their objective without the approval \nof shareholders.  \n \n8. \nUnder the ICA and ICA Rule 35-1, investment companies are licensed, subject to on-site \ninspections  and  off-site  monitoring.  The  regulations  also  provide  guidance  concerning  the \nmaintenance of books and records, the fiduciary obligations of officers and directors, permissible \ncapital structure, and prohibited transactions. At present, there is no requirement that mutual fund \nsales  persons  be  tested  and  certified.  Also,  there  is  no  requirement  that  a designated officer or \nfinancial  principal  be  required  to  be  certified  by  examination  with  respect  to  best  practice  and \nregulatory requirements. Unlike securities broker-dealer members of the stock exchange, no self-\nregulatory organization has been designated for mutual funds.     \n \n9. \nPolicy  and  Regulatory  Considerations.  The  ICA  needs  to  be  modernized.  It  was \nenacted 40 years ago based on the then US Investment Company Act of 1940. At the time, nearly \nall  US  investment  companies  were  closed-end,  whereas  today the dominant form of investment \ncompany is the open-end mutual fund. SEC and the ICAP are working closely with legislators for \nthe passage of Investment Company Act 2002 that seeks to update ICA as follows: (i) give SEC \nmore  exceptive  relief  powers,  (ii)  address  capitalization  issues,  (iii)  remove  the  citizenship \nrequirement  for  the  board  of  directors,  (iv)  have  independent  directors  as  the  majority,  (v)  limit \nexpenses  to  5%,  (vi)  clearly  define  the  requirement  for  registration  of  the  different  securities \nmarket  professionals  and  affiliated  persons;  and  (vii)  increase  penalties  for  violations.  The \nproposed  Personal  Equity  Retirement  Act  (PERA),  currently  read  in  Congress,  seeks  to \nencourage  individuals  to  set  up  their  own  retirement  fund.  Depending  on  how  it  is  structured,  it \ncan be beneficial to the mutual fund industry as an investment outlet for PERA accounts. \n \nFinally, the taxation of mutual funds should be simplified and rationalized to eliminate tax \n10. \ndistortions relative to comparable investment products. One of the drawbacks to listing closed-end \nfunds is that they are subject to an IPO tax, which ranges from 4% to 1% depending on its relative \nweight  to  total  outstanding.  This  IPO  tax  is  an  impediment  to  capital  formation  and  should  be \neliminated for all IPOs.  \n \n11. \nCorporate  Governance.  Investment  companies  are  required  to  file  with  SEC  their \nManual  of  Corporate  Governance.  The  Code  prescribes,  among  other  things,  higher \nqualification  standards  for  directors,  higher  ethical  standards  for  directors  and  committees, \naccountabilities  of  the  board  management  and the company\u2019s external auditors, and reporting \nrequirements. Also included in the Code is the formation of more board committees to monitor \nperformance,  enhance  accountability,  and  ensure  an  appropriate  mix  of  expertise  and \nexperience.  Investment  companies  are  also  required  to  file  with  SEC  their  Anti-Money \nLaundering  Manual.  Mutual  fund sales agents have to be registered with SEC after passing a \nqualifying examination. \n \n \n\n5\n  See SEC Form 8-1 (Registration Statement Under Section 8 of the Revised Securities Act); SEC Form 11A (Annual \nReport  Pursuant  to  Section  11 of RSA and Section 141 of Corporate Code; and SEC Form 11Q (Quarterly Report \nPursuant to the RSA and RSA Rule 11(a)-1(b)(2).\n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n31\n\nInvestment  Advisors.  Investment  advisory  services  may  be  defined  to  encompass  any \n12. \nindividual  or  firm  that  for  compensation  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  providing  advice,  making \nrecommendations,  or  issuing  reports  on  securities,  either  directly,  or  by  means  of  publications. \nThis  function  requires  a  great  deal  of  knowledge  and  professional  skills;  however,  it  does  not \nrequire large amounts of capital. The integrity of the individual or firm providing the advice is very \nimportant.  Typically,  investment  advice  could  be  provided  by  a  securities  broker-dealer,  a  fund \nmanager,  or  by  an  independent  investment  advisory  service.  The  Philippines  does  not  have  an \nInvestment  Advisors  Act.  The  responsibility  of  the  fund  manager  is  covered  under  the  ICA  and \nSEC regulations. Bank trust departments also manage large amounts of money on a discretionary \nbasis.  Their  activities  are governed by banking laws and BSP rules and regulations. At present, \nthe  Philippines  is  in  transition  from  a  merit-based  system  of  regulation  to  one  based  on  full \ndisclosure.  Also,  it  is  expected  that  Congress  will  soon  pass  legislation  authorizing  individual \nretirement  accounts.  As  a  result  of  these  two  events,  it  is  expected  that  the  number  of \nindependent investment advisors will grow in the years ahead.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Pre-Need Industry \n\n13. \nThe  pre-need  industry  in  the  Philippines,  which provides benefits relating to education, \npension funds accumulation, interment and death-related services, has grown remarkably since \nits  inception  in  1966.  The  industry  has  now  become  one  of  the  most  significant  savings \nmobilizers in the Philippines. Since 1977, nearly 161 million plans have been sold. From 1990 to \n2001,  pre-need  annual  sales  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  25%.  Throughout  the  past  decade, \npension  and  education  plans  have  been  the  largest  selling  products  of  the  industry  and  have \nbeen  the  factor  sustaining  the  overall  growth  of  pre-need  product  sales.  In  absolute  terms, \nsales  of  life  and  memorial  plans  have  remained  unchanged;  however,  in  relative  terms,  they \nhave been shrinking in size. Given its remarkable growth, the pre-need industry\u2019s assets in the \nPhilippines  totaled  P159.8  billion  in  2001,  compared  with  the  P147.5  billion  assets  of  the \ninsurance  industry,  P82  billion  of  the  common  trust  fund,  and  P11.5  billion  of  mutual  fund  net \nassets.  In  2002,  however,  sales  of  the  pre-need  companies  dropped  by  2.3%  partly  as  the \nindustry\u2019s poor performance weakened plan holder confidence. \n \nThe pre-need industry\u2014by sales value or size of assets\u2014is highly concentrated. From \n14. \n1991 to 2001, over 60% and 80% of the total industry\u2019s sales were made by the top 5 and top \n10  pre-need  companies  (by  asset  size),  respectively.  For  industry-wide  profitability,  sales \ngrowth  has  not  been  accompanied  by  high  profit  margins.  The  net  profit  margin  was  roughly \nconstant  at  around  4.6%  throughout  1999-2001.  During  this  period,  about  two-  thirds  of  pre-\nneed companies registered positive profit figures.  \n\n \n15. \nPre-Need  Plans.  Pre-need  plans  are  contracts that specify commitment of the pre-need \ncompanies  to  provide  specified  benefits  to  the  plan  holder  or  the  plan  holder\u2019s  beneficiary  on  a \nscheduled date agreed upon at inception. In return, the plan holder is required to pay the pre-need \ncompany in cash or on installment as specified in the contract. Three types of pre-need plans are \noffered  to  plan  holders:  education,  pensions,  and  life  or  memorial  plans.  As  education  plans \nprovide  plan  holder  beneficiaries  with  a  given  stream  of  income,  spread  along  a  certain  time \nperiod,  to  meet  educational  costs;  and  pension  plans  provide  predictable  income  flow  on \nbeneficiaries\u2019  retirement,  they  are  also  referred  to  as  scheduled  benefit  plans.  Life  or  memorial \nplans,  on  the  other  hand,  are  referred  to  as  a  contingent  benefit  plan  as  the  timing  of  benefits \ndepends on the occurrence of a contingency. \n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 1\n\nTo buy a pre-need plan, the plan holder accepts to pay a pre-need firm a given amount as \n16. \na  lump  sum  or  through  a  scheduled  scheme  of  installments.  These  constitute  a  formal  type  of \nself-enforced saving mechanism. But, unlike voluntary saving schemes, pre-need products do not \nallow no-cost withdrawal. In fact, under the new pre-need rules that regulate the sequential status \nof  in-force  pre-need  plans  and,  according  to  the  observed  and  generalized  practice of pre-need \ncompanies, the delinquent or noncomplying plan holder receives no termination values in case of \nlapsed and cancelled plans \n \nRegulatory Framework. Although the pre-need industry began in 1966, supervision by \n17. \nthe SEC did not start until 1978, with SEC\u2019s issuance of the first Rules on Registration and Sale \nof Pre-Need Plans, Pension Plans, Life Plans and Similar Contracts and Investments. With the \napproval  of  the  Revised  Securities  Act  in  1982,  pre-need  plans  were  included  under  the \ndefinition  of  securities,  which  formally  placed  its  regulation  under  the  jurisdiction  of  SEC.  In \n1984,  SEC  issued  the  Revised  Rules  on  Registration  and  Sale  of  Pre-Need  Plans,  Pension \nPlans, Life Plans and Similar Contracts and Investments in 1987.  \n \nThe Securities Regulation Code (SRC), passed in 2000, separated pre-need plans from \n18. \nthe general category of securities. In 2001, SEC issued the New Rules on the Registration and \nSales  of  Pre-need  Plans  of  the  Securities  Regulation  Code  (New  PN  Rules)  consolidating  its \nvarious  rules,  circulars,  and  administrative  orders  on  pre-need  companies  and  introduced \nmeasures  to  improve  the  regulation  of  the  industry.  To  ensure  the  financial  soundness  of  the \npre-need companies, SEC issues investment guidelines for pre-need firms and strengthen their \nprudential  standards  by  raising  the  minimum  paid-up  capital  to  P100  million  for  companies \nselling  all  three  types  of  pre-need  plans,  to  P75  million  for  those  selling  two  types,  and  P50 \nmillion for those selling only one type.  \n\n \n19. \nThe Pre-Need Companies. In recent years, the economic environment has been adverse \nto  the  successful  operation  of  the  pre-need  industry.  With  few  investment  alternatives,  the  pre-\nneed investment portfolio has been invested mainly in (i) treasury bills and government bonds; (ii) \nbank  deposits  (iii)  real-estate,  and  (iv)  listed  stocks.  Following  the  recent  experience  in  global \nfinancial  markets,  returns  on  investments  in  both  debt  and  equity  instruments  have  been  low \nrelative  to  earlier  time  periods,  while  real  estate  values,  which  have  sharply  declined  since  the \nAsian financial crisis, have yet to show signs of recovery. As such, the industry has faced great \ndifficulty  in  meeting  investment  objectives  based  on  the  assumption  of  expected  returns  under \nmore favorable economic and market conditions. In response to the poor investment climate, SEC \nhas  encouraged  trust  entities  to  shift  to  investment  with  high  yields  such  as  dollar-denominated \nGovernment  securities  and  has  allowed  them  to  invest  trust  funds  in  better  yielding  investment \noutlets other than those permitted under existing investment rules.   \n \nPre-need  companies  are  required  to  keep  assets  equal  to  their  actuarial  reserve \n20. \nliabilities (ARL) representing the present value of future plan-holder benefits, in a separate trust \nfund.  When  trust  fund  assets  fall  below  the  ARL,  a  \u201ctrust  fund  deficiency\u201d  results.  During  the \npast  4  years,  over  half  of  all  pre-need  companies  experienced  trust  fund  deficiencies.  When \nSEC  assumed  supervision  over  the  industry,  91  pre-need  companies  with  their  affiliates \nregistered  with  SEC  (Table  A1.2).  However,  only  43  are  still  active6  today.  This  was  partly \n\n6   Licensed to sell pre-need plans. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33\n\nattributed to a considerable degree of buyouts and mergers,7 and an increase in minimum paid-\nup capital to P100 million. The overall deficit in trust funds (held to meet plan holder obligations) \nas  of  30  August  2002  was  P2.0  billion.  This  compares  with  P3.9  billion  in  December  2000, \nbefore regulatory action was taken; however, much of the improvement arises from allocations \nof  interest  in  property  held  by  the  pre-need  companies  to  the  trust  funds.  Of  the  46  reporting \npre-need  companies  in  August  2002,  5  had  deficiencies,  which  were  already  addressed  as  of \nSeptember  2002.  It  seems  likely  that  at  least  one  major  pre-need  company  will  have  to  go \nthrough  some  form  of  resolution  in  2003,  particularly  if  necessary  prudential  and  consumer \nrights regulations are introduced. In addition, a number of trust funds are unlikely to be able to \ncomply with a newly imposed limit on real property holdings. \n \n\nTable A1.2: Status of Pre-Need Plan Companies \n\n \n\nStatus \n\nA.

Trust funds will observe the investment mix per type of plan \nper bank. \nIssue  guidelines  to  actuaries  to  derive  attainable  actuarial  assumptions  and  to \nensure the integrity of the valuation of reserves for trust funds. \nRequire  trustees  to exercise due diligence for protection of plan holders guided \nby  sound  investment  and  to  have  exclusive  management  and  control  over  the \nfunds. \n\n(vii)  Require  pre-need  companies  to  issue  an  information  brochure  to  plan  holders \ncontaining  necessary  information  about  the  plan,  i.e.,  trust  fund,  termination \nvalues, and investment rate of return, the company itself and information on how \nto contact the complaints action unit the pre-need company. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Require  the  issuance  of  a  written  notice  to  the  plan  holder  if  his  plan  will  lapse \nand  the  consequence  if  no  payment  is  received  within  the  grace  period.  The \nnotice  also  states  that  the  plan  will  be  cancelled  if  not  reinstated  within  the \nreinstatement period. \nRequire  pre-need  companies \ncomplaints and answer concerns of plan holders. \nRequire  strict  compliance  with  the  Pre-Need  Uniform  Chart  of  Accounts  for  a \nmore  accurate  accounting  and  reporting  of  the  financial  condition  of  pre-need \ncompanies. \nRequire  pre-need  companies  to  limit  payment  of  commissions  to  10%  of  the \ncontract price of the plans. \n\nto  establish  a  complaints  desk  to  handle \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\nInstitute continuing on-site inspection for actuarial and accounting compliance. \n\n(xii)  Require annual publication of financial condition and trust fund statements. \n(xiii) \n(xiv)  Enforce strict monitoring on compliance with reporting requirements. \n(xv) \n(xvi)  Streamline registration procedures for licensing applications and applications for \n\nInitiate mediation proceedings. \n\nprice increases.  \n\n(xvii)  Require  submission  of  Corporate  Governance  Manual  and  Anti-Money \n\nLaundering Law Manual of Operations. \n\nThe Federation of Pre-Need Plan Companies, Inc. has adopted the following measures \n\n \n22. \nto protect plan holders and strengthen the efficiency of pre-need companies: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nCreate special committees. \nCreate  complaints  desks.  Those  have  since  significantly  reduced  complaints \nregistered with SEC to below 1%. \nInitiate steps to standardize plan contract for the industry.  \nPropose  a  set  of  guidelines  to  (a)  provide  for  a  lower  interest  rate  assumption \nthan 10%, and (b) improve first year margins and cash flow by deferring payment \nof 20% of commission cost to the second year. \nInitiate the establishment of a Pre-Need Plan Holders Protection Fund. \n\n(v) \n(vi)  Work  with  SAP,  Accenture  and  Mopscom,  and  Modnet  to  ensure  that  its \n\nmembers gain access to new technology.  \n\n \n23. \nDespite the above reforms, a law specifically governing the pre-need companies is still \nrequired  to  protect  plan  holders  and  improve  the  financial  soundness  of  pre-need  companies. \nRegulation  has  been  left  to  SEC  to  establish  through  the  issuance  of  rules  and  circulars. \nMoreover, the basic sales practices (and the practice of paying low termination value when the \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n35\n\nplan  holders  fail  to  complete  their  payments)  and  governance  of  the  pre-need  industry  have \nrecently  been  questioned.  Given  these  factors,  combined  with  the  fact  that  the  real  estate \nmarket is not expected to recover significantly and help improve the financial conditions of pre-\nneed  companies  over  the  near  term,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  enhance  monitoring  of  the \nfinancial and operational conditions of the pre-need sector and to increase the frequency of on-\nsite inspection to ensure that the industry is solvent and plan holders protected. \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSIGNIFICANT NONBANK FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS \n \n\n1. \nMajor changes occurred in the financial sector in the Philippines over the last 10 years \nas  a  result  of  Government  and  market  initiatives  to  strengthen  financial  sector  management, \nwhile at the same time liberalizing the sector\u2019s operations. Significant policy measures relating \nto Asian Development Bank operations include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n1992.  The  Capital  Market  Development  Council  was  established,  comprising \nboth  Government  and  private  sector  practitioners.  Its  task  is  to  recommend \nproposals  for  capital  market  development  in  an  integrated  and  consistent \nmanner, and implement subsequent changes in Government policy. The Capital \nMarket Development Council, along with the Capital Market Coordination Council \ncomposed  of  Government  and  representatives,  which  was  set  up  in  1993,  fully \nendorsed  to  the  National  Economic  Development  Authority  and  Department  of \nFinance  the  capital  market  reform  agenda  contained  in  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program. \n\n1993. The central bank was restructured into Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), \nallowing for more focus on and improvement of monetary management. This led \nto  lower  inflation  (18.7%  in  1991  to  around  9% average  during  1994-1996)  and \nlower interest rates. \n\n1994.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  granted  the  Philippine \nStock Exchange (PSE) a license to operate a securities exchange. \n\n1995.  The  banking  system  was  opened  to  foreign  competitors  through  legislation \npassed  in  1994  and  in  1995.  Ten  foreign  banks  were  licensed  to  open  full  service \nbranches. \n\n1995.  BSP  raised  the  minimum  capital  requirements  for  licensed  commercial \nbanks and adopted the Basle Committee norms on capital adequacy and income \nrecognition.  \n\nlaws  and \n\n(Securities  Regulation  and \n1995-1996.  Amended \nEnforcement  Act,  Revised \nInvestment  Company  Act,  Corporation  Code, \nFinancing  Company  Act,  and  Investment  Houses  Law)  governing  financial, \ncapital  market,  and  other  related  activities  to  liberalize  the  markets  were \npresented to Congress.  \n\nregulations \n\n1996.  SEC  shifted  its  regulatory  philosophy  from  a  merit-based  approach  to full \ndisclosure and enforcement.  \n\n1997. Philippine Central Depository, Inc. (PCDI) was fully operational. \n\n1998. Regulatory responsibilities were realigned along more functional lines such \nas giving SEC jurisdiction over all investment houses and finance companies not \naffiliated with banks. \n\n1998. SEC granted a self-regulatory organization license to PSE after PSE met \nthe  Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs (FIBV) criteria and received \naccredited FIBV status.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2  37\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(xi) \n\n1999.  BSP  and  SEC  agreed  to  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  undertake \ninformation sharing in areas of overlapping jurisdiction. \n\n(xii) \n\n2000.  The  Securities  Regulation  Code  (SRC)  was  enacted,  providing  the \nfoundation for deeper changes in capital market regulation. \n\n(a)  SEC was reorganized. \n(b)  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP)  was \n\noperational. \n\n(xiii) \n\n2001. SEC approved the implementing rules and regulations of the SRC. \n\n(a)  SEC issued a regulation new rule on the registration and sales of pre-\n\nneed plans. \n\n(b)  PSE was demutualized. \n(c)  The Anti-Money Laundering Law was passed. \n\n(xiv)  2002. SEC adopted the Code of Corporate Governance. \n\n(a)  SEC launched on-line registration for corporations, partnerships, and \n\nassociations. \n\n(b)  SEC  issued  a  circular,  establishing  the  minimum  paid-up  capital \n\nrequirements for pre-need companies. \n\n(c)  SEC  issued  a  circular  concerning  the  accountability  of  actuaries  for \n\npre-need companies. \n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE  \nNONBANK FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE PROGRAM  \n \nProgram Objective: To support the process of capital formation through improved corporate governance in the nonbank financial sector.

To  achieve  this\npolicy  goal,  the  Government  intends  to  deepen  reforms  in  all  areas  of  the  economy,  with  the\nfocus  on  addressing  structural  constraints \nin  domestic  and  external\nimbalances.  The  Government  is furthering  reforms  in the  financial  sector.  The  Government  has\nembarked  reforms  for  the  past  three  years  for  the  non-bank  financial  sector,  knowing  that  this\nin  an  environment  where  policies,  laws  and  regulations  are  competitively\nsector  is  operating \ndisadvantaged  and  its  development  stunted.  Nevertheless, \nfurther.  reforms  are  needed  to\ndevelop  the  sector  in  order to  benefit  from  integration  in the  regional  and global  capital  markets\nover  the  medium  and  long-term.\n\nthat  have  resulted \n\nWith  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  launched  the\nNonbank  Financial  Governance  (NBFG)  Program  in  2001.  The  reform  program  under  the\nNBFG  focused \nlargely  on  four  following  areas:  (i)  the  restructuring  of  the  Securities  and\nExchange  Commission  (SEC)  as  a  result  of  the  enactment  of  the  Securities  Regulations  Code\n(SRC)  in 2000 and  the  strengthening  of the  SEC's  monitoring  and  enforcement  capacity;  (ii) the\nmodernization  of  the  governance  and  regulatory  structure  of  the  Philippines  Stock  Exchange\n(PSE);  (iii)  strengthening  market  oversight.  compliance  and  enforcement;  and  (iv)  facilitating\ndiversification  and  innovation  in corporate  financing.\n\nin  these \n\nfour  areas.  With \n\nProgress  has  been  made \n\nthe  SEC's\nresponsibilities,  under  the  SRC,  focusing  more  on  regulation.  and  enforcement,  SEC  has  fully\nreorganized \nits  computer\nin  2000  and  has  since  gradually  built  its  capacity  and  upgraded \nsystem  to  meet  the  SRC  mandate. \nIndeed,  with  the  SRC  allowing  provisions  for  the  SEC  to\nraise  salary  standards  to  attract  qualified  staff,  the  SEC  is  now  increasingly  attracting  new\ngraduates  trained  in  both  finance  and  law.  On the  other  hand,  PSE's  equity  ownership  by the\nbrokers  still  exceeds  the  ceiling  set  by the  SRC for  an  industry  and  business  group.  However,\nthe  majority  of  PSE's  Board of Directors IS now made up of independent  directors.\n\nthe  scope  of \n\n\fAppendix  6 \n\n65\n\nAs  for  governance,  compliance,  and  enforcement, \n\nthe  SRC  now  requires  that  all  listed\ncompanies  have  at  least  two  or  20%  (whichever  is  lesser)  independent  directors  who  represent\ninterests.  Recently,  the  SEC  sought  to  tighten  this\nthe  public  and  minority  shareholders' \nrequirement \nfrom  20%  or  two  independent\ndirectors,  whichever  is higher.  The  SEC also  established  a separate  depar1ment for compliance\nand  enforcement,  and  created  separate  special  offices  for the  General  Counsel  and the General\nAccountant  and  restructured \nIt  developed  in-house\ntraining  to  strengthen  its  monitoring  and enforcement  capacities.\n\nfurther  by  increasing  the  independent  directors \n\nthe  Departments  for  market  regulation. \n\nThe  Government  will  build  on  the  reforms  undertaken  under  NBFG.  The  Second\nthrough  this\n(SNFG)  Program  which  ADB \n\nis  supporting \n\nNonbank  Financial  Governance \nProgram  Loan  will  focus  on four  major  areas,  as follows:\n\nframework \n\nfunctioning \n\nand  properly \n\nStrengthening \n\nfinancial  markets \n\nthe  regulatory  and  policy \n\nfor  the  development  of  viable\n(i) \ninstitutions \nFirstly,  the  Government  aims  to\nestablish  an  effective  anti-money  laundering  regime.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the Government\nworked  closely  with  Congress  to  enact  the  amendments \nto  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Law\n(R.A.  9194)  to  address  FATF  concerns  as  a  crucial  step  to  remove  the  Philippines  from  the\nNCCT  list.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Philippines'\nAnti-Money  Laundering  Council  (AMLC)  as  well  as  other  key  agencies  involved  to  effectively\nimplement \nIn  addition,  AMLC  will  establish  transactions  monitoring  system  and  the\nGovernment  will  request  the  Supreme  Cour1 to  designate  courts  to  expeditiously  try anti-money\nlaundering  cases.  Secondly,  the  PSE has  now  been  corporatized  (changed  from  a  non-stock\nto  a  stock  corporation)  and  the  majority  of  its  board  of  directors  is  now  independent.  PSE  is\nencouraged \nto  develop  a  divestiture  strategy  by  offering  its  shares  for  broad  public  ownership\nonce  market  conditions  improve.\n\nthe  law. \n\nimpeding \n\nconditions \n\nthe  market  efficiency  and  development \n\nThe  PSE  has  also  been  required  to  build  up  public  confidence \nfor  effective  self-regulation \n\nin  the  exchange  by\n.in  a  demutualized  environment  and\nestablishing \nstrengthen  its  surveillance  and  audit system.  Thirdly,  the  Government  is taking  steps to remove\npolicy  distortions \nin  both  debt  and  equity\nmarkets. \nIn  order  to  attract  investment  flows  and  foster  deeper  markets,  the  Government  has\nsubmitted  legislation  to  Congress  to  rationalize  the  Documentary  Stamp  Tax  (DST)  on debt and\nequity  instruments,  stock  lending  and  borrowing  transactions.  Moreover,  the  Government  will\nreview  the  Initial  Public  offering  (IPO) tax  on  listed  securities  (i.e.  corporate  stocks  and closed-\nend  investment  companies).  Lastly,  to  promote  the  development  of  the  capital  markets,  the\nGovernment,  through  SEC,  will  develop a middle  and  long-term  strategy  for  the  development  of\nthe  capital  markets  in order  to advise arid guide  policy  makers  on  existing  constraints  taking  into\naccount  the  need to  achieve  market  efficiency  and  attract  investment  flows  to the  Philippines.\n\nFurther strengthening of SEC supervisory and surveillance capacity  SEC is\n(ii) \nupgrading information technology to enable it to gather and analyze databases for monitoring\nand surveillance purposes.  In addition, the SEC is training its own staff in market surveillance,\nenforcement, and compliance in line with its new mandate under the SRC.  The SEC will also\nwork closely with the BSP on joint on-site inspections of dually regulated financial institutions to\nminimize  cost  of  supervision  while  ensuring that  regulatory  gaps  are  minimized.  Joint-\ninspection  procedures by  the  SEC-PSE on  PSE  member brokers  and  dealers will  also be\nupdated and strengthened.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix  6\n\nfrom \n\nfraud, \n\ninvestors \n\nImproving \n\nto  protect \n\ntransparency \n\ninsolvency,  or\n(iii) \nmisconduct  To prevent accounting fraud, the Government is strengthening audit requirements.\nIn  particular,  the  Philippines will  gradually switch  from  the  Philippine GAAP to  International\nAccounting Standards.  The change is set to be completed by the beginning of 2005.  The SEC\nhas also required the auditors of all public companies to report serious breaches of accounting\nstandards  in the  event the  company fails to make public disclosure of  such information.  The\nSEC will require all listed firms to rotate auditing firms every five years to improve quality audits.\nTo ensure the solvency of NBFls and investor protection, SEC will take steps to rationalize and\nstrengthen  capital  requirements of  NBFls to  be  risk-based and in harmony with international\nbest practices.  The SEC is also taking necessary steps to establish fit and proper standards for\nthe appointed or elected directors of NBFls.\n\nfunds  while  ensuring \n\nFacilitating  the  mobilization  of  domestic  savings  to  increase  supplies  of\n(iv) \ninvestment \ninvestor  protection  As  the  pre-need  industry  is  growing\nrapidly,  it  is  essential  that  the  industry  is  properly  regulated  and  supervised  to  ensure  the\nsolvency  of  pre-need  plan  companies  and  investors  are  protected.  For  this  purpose,  a  draft\nPre-need  Code  has  been  submitted  to Congress.  Once  the  Code  is enacted,  it is crucial  that  a\nnew  supervisory  agency  of  the  pre-need  companies  issues  comprehensive  guidelines  on  pre-\nneed  advertisement \nto  prevent  fraud  and  review  an  investor  protection  scheme  to  compensate\npolicy  holders  in the  event  of  pre-need  companies'  insolvency.\n\nThe  SEC  has  submitted  a  Revised  Investment  Company  Act  (RICA)  to  Congress  which\nwouid  equalj~e  treatment  and  market  access  for  both  domestic  and  foreign  investors  and\nmarket  participants..  RICA  will further  stimulate  competition  in the  mutual  fund  industry.\n\nThe  Government \n\nis  confident  that  it  can  successfully \n\nimplement  and  achieve  the\nobjectives  of  the  reform  program. \ntherefore,  seeks  ADS's  favorable\nconsideration  of  its  request  for  a  loan  of  $150  million  and  an  associated  technical  assistance\ngrant  of  $500,000  for  support  of the  nonbank  financial  sector  and  to assist  in the  preparation  of\na  long-term  strategy \nin  the  Philippines.  The\nfor  the  development  of  the  capital  markets \nGovernment  will  use  the  proceeds  of the  loan to  finance  the  costs  of  adjustment  resulting  from\nthe  reforms.\n\nThe  Government, \n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ~=~~~~aChO\nIO;e~~~~~m~\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n22 \n \n24 \n \n24 \n\n \n28 \n \n71 \n \n71 \n\n \n71 \n \n84 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n67\n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nThe  proceeds  of the  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  currency  expenditures  for \n\n1. \nthe reasonable cost of imported goods required during implementation of the Program.  \n \n2. \n \n\nNotwithstanding the provision of para. 1, no withdrawals will be made for \n\n(i) \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  Customs  Coordination  Council \nNomenclature  chapters  or  headings  as  designated  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) by notice to the Government; \n\nGroup \n\nSubgroup \n\nDescription of Items \n\n \n22.03-22.10 \n \n24.01 \n \n24.02 \n\n \n71.01-71.04 \n \n71.05-71.06 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAlcoholic beverages  \n \nTobacco, unmanufactured tobacco refuse;  \n \nTobacco,  manufactured    (whether  or  not  containing  tobacco \nsubstitutes) \n \n\n \nPearls; precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \n \nJewelry  of  gold,  silver,  or  platinum  group  metals  (except \nwatches  and  watch  cases);  goldsmiths\u2019  or  silversmiths\u2019  wares \n(including set gems) \n \n\n28.50-28.52  Radioactive and associated materials  \n\n71.07-71.08  Gold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ores and concentrates) \n\n \n84.59 \n\n \nNuclear  reactors  and  parts  thereof,  fuel  elements  (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower; \n\npayments  made  for  expenditures  incurred  more  than  180  days  before  the  \neffectiveness date of the loan; \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  agreed  to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any loans from ADB; \n \nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption; and  \n\nexpenditures  for  pesticides  categorized  as  extremely  hazardous  or  highly \nhazardous  in  Class  1a  or  1b,  respectively,  of  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \nClassification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n68\n\n \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nA. \n \nThe objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) help the Government prepare \n1. \nmedium- and long-term strategies to advance reforms and further develop the nonbank financial \n(NBF)  sector,  and  (ii)  promote  competition  and  remove  impediments  to  the  creation  and \ndistribution of innovative financial products and services.

The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $55,000 equivalent \nof  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $215,000  equivalent  to  finance \ncounterpart  staff,  office facilities,  and  workshops.  The TA  will  last for 8  months October  2003-\nJune 2004.

Financial  sector  development  facilitates  long-term  economic  growth  by \nsupporting  productivity  growth  and  stimulating  savings  and  investment.  Of  these  two  channels,  raising \nproductivity is the chief way of promoting long-term economic growth.  Financial sector development can \nraise  productivity  by  (i)  improving resource  allocation,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the monitoring  of resource \nusage. A key factor in supporting growth through this channel is the effectiveness of the regulatory and \nsupervisory  system  in  supporting  financial  sector  efficiency.  By  strengthening  financial  sector \ngovernance,  the  Program  aims  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  sector's  resource  allocation  and \nmonitoring  function.  A  well-governed  financial  sector  can  also  stimulate  growth  and  employment \ngeneration  by  increasing  investor  confidence  and  the  flow  of  much-needed  investment  capital  to  the \nPhilippines. Details are in the attached Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nReforms under the program may be grouped in four broad areas: (i) development of an effective \nanti-money  laundering  (AML)  regime,  (ii)  strengthening  investor  confidence  and  protection  in  the  stock \nexchange, (iii) strengthening market governance, and (iv) facilitating resource mobilization. \n \n\nAssessment of the Program \n\n1.  Establish an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n \n3. \nThe Program supports the development of an effective AML regime. Money laundering activities \nhave their origins in graft, corruption, and other forms of criminal activity. These activities undermine the \ngovernment's legitimacy as well as investor confidence. The Program supports the establishment of an \nappropriate  legal  and  institutional  framework,  and  related  capacity-building  measures,  necessary  for \nimplementing  an  effective  AML  regime.  An  effective  AML  regime  will  provide  the  government  with  key \ntools in its fight against graft and corruption and is fundamental to strengthening market governance and \ninvestor confidence. \n \n\n2.  Increase Investor Confidence and Protection in the Stock Exchange \n \n4. \nThe  Program  supports  strengthening  the  Philippines  Stock  Exchange's  (PSE)  governance \nstructures, procedures, and capacity. It also aims to ensure that an appropriate self-regulatory framework \nis  developed  to  allow  PSE  to  function  effectively  as  a  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  under  a \ndemutualized  regime.  These  measures  are  important  to  supporting  the  institutional  transformation  of \nPSE from a cozy club of broker members to a well-functioning SRO operating in the interests of investors \nand the general public. By strengthening investor protection, they aim to improve investor confidence in \nthe securities market and stimulate the flow of foreign and domestic investment. \n \n\n3.  Strengthening Market Governance \n \n5. \nThe  Program  supports  the  adoption  of International  Accounting  Standards  and  strengthening  of \nthe  quality  of  information  disclosed  to  the  market,  strengthening  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission's (SEC) supervisory and surveillance capacity, and strengthening of prudential standards in \nthe  nonbank  financial  sector.  These  measures  are  aimed  at  supporting  long-term  economic  growth  by \nfacilitating better resource allocation and monitoring and stimulating investment by strengthening investor \nprotection and confidence. \n \n\n4.  Facilitating Resource Mobilization \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\nThe  Program  supports \n\n70\n \n6. \ninvestment  vehicles  and \nrationalization of tax treatment for financial instruments. Strengthening the regulation and supervision of \npre-need plans, in particular, is important to protect policyholders and ensure the continued viability and \ngrowth  of  this  sector.  Removing  the  documentary  stamp  tax  on  secondary  trading  of  debt  and  equity \ninstruments is important to increase market liquidity and attract a wider range of investors. \n \n\nthe  sound  development  of  collective \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\n   A.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines \n \nThe financial sector plays a powerful, through indirect role in reducing poverty by facilitating long-term economic \ngrowth.  Growth, however, is turbulent and not necessarily pro-poor.  Growth entails change, which the poor may \noften not be well-equipped to cope with.  A well-governed financial sector that facilitates competition can help make \ngrowth user-friendlier (i) improving access to savings, credit, and insurance instruments, which enable the poor to \ncushion shocks as well as take advantage of opportunities created by change; and (ii) allowing for better terms on \nthose instruments. \n\nYes  \n\nA well-governed financial sector also reduces the likelihood and severity of financial and economic crises and \nconsequently helps safeguard against a corresponding marked increase in the incidence of poverty.  Balanced \nfinancial sector development can promote financial system stability and strengthening by allowing risks to be more \nevenly spread among types of financial institutions and spurring competition between them.  The financial sector in \nthe Philippines is currently bank-dominated and heavily unbalanced in its structural composition.  Development of a \nsound nonbank financial sector is key to providing effective alternate means of corporate finance as well as \nstrengthening overall financial sector integrity. \n\n                 B.    Poverty Analysis \n\n                     Proposed Classification: Growth \n\nAnalysis: \nJob creation has not kept pace with the growth of the labor force and unemployment continues to be high and rising.  \nHigher levels of investment are necessary if the economy is to attain a higher growth path and unemployment is to be \nreduced.   \n \nThe financial sector clearly has a central part to play in this effort through its role in channeling savings to productive \ninvestment to finance growth. Currently, however, the financial sector in the Philippines is bank-dominated and \nlending by the banking system to the corporate sector has been highly constrained by nonperforming loans (NPLs) \nthat have steadily accumulated since the crisis (latest estimates point to NPLs at above 15% of commercial banks\u2019 \ntotal assets). The high level of NPLs within the banking system and overreliance of the corporate sector on bank \nlending are symptomatic of poor lending, weak governance in the financial sector, and lack of alternative sources of \nfinancing to the banking system. The need for reforms to address these distortions and support the development of a \nsound nonbank financial sector is fundamental if the financial sector is to act as a facilitator of rather than a constraint \nto long-term economic growth. \n \nInvestment has also been significantly hindered by weak investor sentiment due in part to chronic and widespread \ngraft and corruption. The Government's efforts establishing an effective anti-money laundering regime, represent an \nimportant step forward in addressing this problem, as an effective regime has the potential to serve as a key tool in \ntackling graft and corruption. \n\n \n\n   C.
