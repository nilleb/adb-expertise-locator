I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $400,000,000 to HSBC Bank USA, National Association for the Tangguh Liquefied \nNatural Gas Expansion Project in Indonesia.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The  Tangguh  natural  gas  liquefaction  facility  has  been  converting  natural  gas  into \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) since 2009 in West Papua Province, Indonesia\u2019s least-developed \nregion.  Together  with  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  international \ncommercial banks, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded the greenfield development of \nthe plant\u2019s first two LNG production units, called trains, in 2006. The ADB loan for trains 1 and 2 \nwas fully prepaid in 2014.2  \n \n3.  LNG production from trains 1 and 2 has exceeded expectations, and the sponsors now \nwant to expand the facility by adding a third train. State-owned Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN, \nthe  national  power  utility)  has  committed  to  buy  75%  of  train  3\u2019s  production  to  generate \nelectricity for the domestic market. The remaining 25% of the new unit\u2019s LNG output has been \ncommitted to Kansai Electric of Japan. \n \n4.  Supporting cleaner power generation using indigenous fuel. Indonesia\u2019s economy \nis Southeast Asia\u2019s largest. Gross domestic product was an estimated $888.5 billion in 2014, \nand economic growth since the 1997 Asian financial crisis has averaged about 5% a year. The \ncountry has transitioned from a resource- and export-based economy to a manufacturing one, \nbut the energy sector has not kept pace with either the overall growth or change.3 Investment in \nexploration for and the production, transport, conversion, and distribution of energy has been \ninadequate  and  often  carried  out  inefficiently.4 The  power  subsector  has fallen  particularly \nbehind.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  estimates  that  rising  demand  for \nelectricity, which is forecasted to increase by 8.5% per annum under the current economic \ngrowth projections, will create a power shortage of about 35 gigawatts (GW) before 2020. \n \n5.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  is  facilitating  PLN\u2019s  procurement5 of  new  generation \ncapacity through an expansion program in which 13 of 35 GW are expected to be gas-fired \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2005. Reports and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors Tangguh Liquefied Natural \nGas Project. Manila \n3  In 2013, Indonesia\u2019s national office of statistics estimated that gross domestic product derived from the following \nsectors: manufacturing (24%); agriculture (14%); trade, hotel, and hospitality (14%); mining and quarrying (11%); \nconstruction (10%); government and private services (11%); finance, real estate, and business services (8%); \ntransport and communication (7%); and electricity, gas, and water supply (1%). \n4  ADB. 2015. Summary of Indonesia\u2019s Energy Sector Assessment. ADB Papers on Indonesia, No. 9. Manila. \n5  A 2009 electricity law formally ended PLN\u2019s monopoly on the power sector. However, the utility is still the major \nprovider of electricity infrastructure in the country and owns roughly 85% of the total generation capacity. To deal \nwith the projected power shortage, the government introduced a series of programs to fast-track power generation \nexpansion. The latest, launched in 2015, targets the development of 35 GW of new power generation capacity, \n36% of which is expected to be gas-fired. ", "2   \npower plants.6 At present, natural gas accounts for about 25% of PLN fuel mix, but the utility has \nbeen  struggling  to  ensure  steady  and  reliable  supply  while  competing  with  growing \nmanufacturing and petrochemical businesses that have driven the growth of gas\u2019 domestic \ndemand.7 . The LNG from Tangguh will ensure to PLN the much needed relief from intermittent \ngas supply and support the expansion of PLN\u2019s growing gas-fired generation capacity. \n \n6.  Supporting sustainable growth. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources sees a \ngreater role for natural gas as important to its goal of reducing the use of oil and coal in the \ncountry, particularly for power generation. The use of gas-fired generation can improve the \nenvironmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and coal as fuels for \npeak electricity generation. Gas engines and turbines can ramp up more quickly than coal and \ndiesel-fired units and thus are better suited to responding rapidly to load fluctuations. This in \nturn can enable greater use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar that can \nprovide power only intermittently, as well as eliminate the need to invest in the large and \nexpensive battery storage capacity these renewable systems might otherwise require.8 ADB \ncalculates that using the gas from the new train 3 to generate power rather than coal could \nresult in emission savings of up to 9.15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. \n \n7.  The project is also of important to Indonesia\u2019s future economic growth. The country was \none of the world\u2019s largest LNG exporters in the early 1990s, accounting for almost 25% of global \nLNG exports.9 Competition from new entrants in the LNG export markets had reduced this share \nto only about 6.6% by 2015.10 Meanwhile, the country\u2019s gas reserves have been declining, and \nnew fields are increasingly smaller, more remote, and located in deeper waters. This makes \nthem more costly to exploit. The development of train 3 at the Tangguh plant will help the \ncountry expand use of an existing gas reserve at a cost that is competitive with other large LNG \ndevelopments. This is because of the economies of scale that will be achieved by building on \nthe existing LNG facilities. The 25% of production committed to the export market will help the \ngovernment maintain access to hard currency. \n \n8.  Supporting inclusive growth in eastern Indonesia. The project will enable ADB to \ncontinue making a positive impact on the inclusive growth in eastern Indonesia it achieved \nunder its earlier project to develop the facility\u2019s first and second trains.11 That project was rated \nexcellent for private sector development by both ADB\u2019s extended annual review report12 and the \nsubsequent validation report by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. Inclusive growth \nwas achieved by creating thousands of jobs and helping to improve livelihoods in one of the \npoorest regions of Indonesia. The initial Tangguh LNG operation was the first upstream oil and \n                                                \n6  The energy division of the Southeast Asia Department of ADB is proposing to support the government with a $500 \nmillion sector loan to help improve access to electricity services in eastern Indonesia. The loan would help PLN \ndevelop a cluster of new small to medium-sized gas-fired power stations. The new power stations will have lower \ngeneration costs and emit less pollutants and carbon dioxide than similar diesel-fired units. The concept paper for \nthis project was cleared in March 2016. \n7  Indonesia\u2019s LNG consumption grew from 35.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2004 to 38.4 bcm in 2014, peaking at \n43.4 bcm in 2010. The year-on-year growth in 2014 was 5.1%, compared with 2% growth in the Asia and Pacific \nregion and 0.4% globally. Source: BP. 2015. BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015. \n8  For example, an off-the-shelf Wartsila gas engine has a ramp-up rate of 100 MW per minute, which means that the \nengine goes from zero to 50 MW of power generation capacity in just 30 seconds. The proposed ADB loan \n(footnote 6) will include some pilot gas-solar hybrid units in loan projects being discussed with PLN. \n9 International Gas Union.

Extended Annual Review Report: Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project in Indonesia. Manila ", "3 \ngas project in Indonesia developed through public consultations with local communities and \ngovernments that were led by ADB environmental and social safeguards teams. \n \n2.  Project Design \n9.  Trains 1 and 2 of the Tangguh plant were designed to produce 3.8 million metric tons \nper annum (mmtpa) of LNG each. The output has been sold to buyers in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States through long-term agreements. \nTrain 3 is expected to have the same capacity as each of the first two and thus expand the \nfacility\u2019s existing LNG production by 50%.  The project will add the third 3.8 mmtpa LNG train as \nwell as the associated offshore and onshore facilities and other supporting infrastructure. The \nnew train is expected to start operations in 2020. \n \n10.  The onshore train 3 facility will be constructed adjacent to trains 1 and 2, using smart \nstandardization\u2014i.e.,  using  the  same  specifications  as  those  for  the  first  two  trains  with \nalterations based on the lessons learned over the plant\u2019s 7 years of operations and the latest \nbest practices in the industry. Two additional offshore unmanned platforms are going to be \ndeveloped for this purpose.13 The fields supplying the Tangguh facilities are within the Berau, \nMuturi, and Wiriagar concession areas covered by three production sharing contracts (PSCs) \nentered  into  between  several  international  oil  and  gas  companies  and  the  government, \nrepresented by a special task force for upstream oil and gas business activities established by \npresidential decree.14  \n \n11.  As was the case in all other LNG projects in Indonesia, including the existing Tangguh \nplant, the project will be financed through a trustee borrowing scheme (TBS). The TBS is a \nfinancing scheme developed in 1986 to facilitate financing for the Bontang LNG project within \nthe government\u2019s regulatory framework that limits the ownership of upstream oil and gas assets \nto the government. Since then, all LNG projects in the country have been financed under the \nTBS. Under the TBS, financiers lend funds to an offshore trustee acting as borrower and paying \nagent. The funds are in turn made available to the project. All LNG revenues are sent directly to \nthe offshore trustee. The trustee makes the loan interest payments and principal repayments to \nlenders out of a percentage of LNG revenues that is called the source of debt service. These \npayments are made before (with respect to source of debt service only) other costs or taxes are \ndeducted. \n \n3.  Project Sponsors \n12.  Based on the three Tangguh PSCs, the working interests in the Tangguh LNG project \nare shared between the government (through the special task force for upstream oil and gas \nbusiness activities) and 10 experienced international oil and gas contractors. The sponsors \ninclude  BP  and  CNOOC,  Japan  Oil,  Gas,  and  Metals  National  Corporation  (JOGMEC), \nMitsubishi  Corporation,  INPEX  Corporation,  JX  Nippon,  Mitsui,  Sojitz  Corporation,  and \nSumitomo Corporation. BP Berau, a subsidiary of BP, operates the project on behalf of the \nsponsors. \n \n \n                                                \n13 Trains 1 and 2 are fed by two offshore unmanned platforms that extract gas from the Vorwata field, which is the \nonly one currently developed in the concession area. \n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \n13.  Guarantee.  BP  Corporation  North  America  Inc.  (BPCNAI)  will  fully  guarantee  the \nproposed ADB loan. The unconditional and irrevocable guarantee is expected to cover the \nproject\u2019s entire payment obligation under the ADB loan. BPCNAI is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nBP and its largest subsidiary worldwide. In 2015, it recorded total sales of $223 billion. BPCNAI \nis currently rated A3 with a positive outlook by  Moody's and A\u2013 with a stable outlook by \nStandard & Poor's (S&P). \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n14.  Impacts. The Tangguh LNG expansion will provide much-needed natural gas to help \nmeet  rapidly  growing  domestic  demand,  particularly  in  the  power  sector.  In  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy, the project will support development of a more sustainable fuel mix to \nreduce carbon emissions by using natural gas to displace coal or diesel in powering electricity \ngeneration (para. 5). This will help improve the quality of life in Indonesia and be a key driver of \ngreater economic activity. The project will accelerate economic development in the province of \nWest Papua, providing additional local employment opportunities and scope for human resource \ndevelopment in one of the country\u2019s poorest regions. \n \n15.  Outcome.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  gas  production  for  domestic  use.  The \nTangguh facility\u2019s production capacity is expected to expand from 7.6 mmtpa to 11.4 mmtpa per \nannum with the addition of train 3, 75% of which is committed to help meet domestic demand for \nelectricity.  \n \n16.   Output. The output will be the completion of train 3 and the related infrastructure. This \nwill  include  the  completion  and  start  of  operations  of  two  additional  offshore  unmanned \nplatforms; 29 kilometers of undersea gas pipeline; one additional LNG jetty; the additional 3.8 \nmmtpa LNG production train; one additional utility for power generation; and additional water \ntreatment,  wastewater  treatment,  and  appropriate  expansion  of  solid  waste  management \nfacilities. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n17.  Consistency with ADB Strategy and country strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  by  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  15 \nExpanding the LNG infrastructure and domestic gas supply in Indonesia has the potential to \noffset greenhouse gas emissions generated by coal-fired or diesel-fired power plants. The \nproject is also consistent with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Indonesia for \n2015,16 because it seeks to improve Indonesia\u2019s energy security, diversify its domestic fuel mix \ndiversification,  and  support  economic  growth  in  the  less-developed  eastern  region  of  the \ncountry.  \n \n18.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  In  line  with \nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Energy  Policy17 and  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,18 ADB  has  focused  on \npromoting power-generation alternatives that are more sustainable than coal- and diesel-fired \ngeneration. While coal and diesel are still the dominant fuels in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix, ADB is \ncommitted through its public and private sector operations to support the development of the \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

Project Cost and Financing Plan \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n \nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Indonesia\u2019s Oil and Gas Law 22/2001 provides the framework for the oil and gas \nindustry in the country. The law distinguishes between upstream and downstream \nactivities. Upstream activities are to be conducted under cooperation contracts with the \ngovernment\u2019s special working unit. This is currently the special task force for upstream \noil and gas business activities, based on presidential regulation number 9 of 2013.  \nManagement and  BP Berau is the operator of the Tangguh LNG facility. BP Berau is a wholly owned \noperations  subsidiary of BP. The operator has remained unchanged since the start of the plant\u2019s \noperations in 2009. BP Berau will operate train 3 after the plant\u2019s expansion in a fully \nintegrated manner with the two existing trains. \nImplementation period  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nConstruction  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \narrangements \nRevenue structure  The LNG output of train 3 has been fully committed through two sales and purchase \nagreements with PLN and Kansai Electric Power. PLN has revenue equal to Rp292.72 \ntrillion and ranks 477 on the Fortune Global 500 list. PLN has ratings of Baa3 with \nMoody\u2019s, BBB\u2013 with Fitch, and BB with Standard & Poor\u2019s. Kansai is one of the 10 \nmajor electric utility companies in Japan.

ADB will provide a direct loan of $400 million to the trustee borrower, HSBC Bank USA, \nNational Association. The loan will be guaranteed by BPCNAI, which is currently rated A3 by \nMoody\u2019s and A\u2013 by S&P. \n \n ", "6   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s role in the project will be similar to the one it played in the financing for the initial \ntwo trains of the Tangguh LNG facility. It will mitigate the risks for all the stakeholders of \nsubstandard implementation of environmental and social safeguards. ADB\u2019s additionality in the \noriginal  Tangguh  LNG  greenfield  development  project  was  rated  excellent:  ADB\u2019s  work \npromoted sustainable LNG development and inclusive growth (footnote 12). The value added by \nADB  in  the  greenfield  development  was  confirmed  in  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s validation report and in these ways has been repeatedly cited publicly by the \ngovernment and BP. ADB due diligence for the proposed project showed that ADB can help \nimprove some of the environmental and social safeguards during the operation so that they \nmeet international standards that go beyond those set by Indonesia\u2019s law. The sponsors have \nrecognized the additional positive value of ADB\u2019s participation in the financing and execution of \nthe original Tangguh development and have asked that it continue this support through the \nplant\u2019s expansion. This will ensure that the safeguard achievements of the initial operation will \nbe sustained.  \n \nC.  Risks \n25.   Sponsor risk. The sponsor group includes a combination of state-owned enterprises \nand large conglomerates with substantial experience in natural gas, petrochemical and derived \nproducts trading, manufacturing and distribution.  \n \n26.  Project  completion  risk.  As  an  expansion  of  an  existing  brownfield  project,  the \nTangguh  LNG  expansion  should  experience  reduced  construction  and  operational  risks. \nLessons learned from trains 1 and 2 are well-understood and will be applied in the design and \nconstruction of train 3, with BP Berau serving as project manager for the expansion.  \n \n27.  Operation and management risk. BP Berau, the operator of Tangguh, will manage \ntrain 3 as part of an integrated LNG production complex. In addition to its parent\u2019s global \nexperience on LNG projects, BP Berau has a solid track record of successful operations at \nTangguh  and  is  well-positioned  to  manage  the  expanded  LNG  facility,  particularly  from  a \ntechnical and staffing perspective. \n \n28.  Offtake and pricing risks. The project has contracted long-term take-or-pay sales and \npurchase agreements with PLN and Kansai Electric Power covering 100% of the total estimated \ntrain 3 production, effectively mitigating offtake risk.  \n \n29.  Gas reserve risk. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n30.  Foreign exchange risk. Revenue from LNG proceeds will be paid entirely in US dollar. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n31.  Guarantor risk. The guarantor risk is acceptable. BPCNAI guarantees the project\u2019s debt \nservice to ADB.  \n \n32.  Environmental  and  social  risks.  Environmental  and  social  impacts and  mitigation \nmeasures are comprehensively addressed in an environmental and social impact assessment \n(ESIA)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Greater  use  of  LNG  is  recognized  as  an \nimportant part of the change in the energy mix required to transition to a low-carbon economy. ", "7 \nBased  on  energy  produced  or  consumed,  LNG  use  can  result  in  lower  emissions  of  the \ngreenhouse gases implicated in global warming than the use of coal or diesel.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory A for environment and indigenous people and category B for involuntary resettlement. \nThe potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nthe sponsors to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n34.  Environment. Because the project involves the expansion of the existing LNG facility \nand infrastructure and operations similar to those of the original two trains, most of the required \nenvironmental safeguards measures and the institutional capacity are already in place, as is a \ncommitment to meet these standards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nan audit of the existing facilities was carried out, and the project sponsors have agreed to take \nthe limited number of corrective actions recommended in audit report.19 The government has \napproved the project on the basis of an environmental and social impact assessment (analisis \nmengenai dampak lingkungan [AMDAL]) prepared by BP Berau in 2014 that meets Indonesia\u2019s \nown requirements. ADB has requested that supplements be added to the assessment to bring it \ninto line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. 20 The project is located in an \narea of biodiversity significance and classified by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement as critical \nhabitat. A critical habitat assessment has demonstrated that the project is able to operate in \ncompliance with the critical habitat requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35.  The operations of train 3 will generate additional emissions which will meet be monitored \nto ensure they meet local requirements and international discharge standards. Before and \nduring construction, the EPC contractor will be required to develop and implement detailed \nconstruction  environmental  and  safety  management  plans  that  are  consistent  with  BP\u2019s \nstringent requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36.  Social  safeguards.
