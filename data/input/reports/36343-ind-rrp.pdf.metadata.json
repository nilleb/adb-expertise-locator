An environmental assessment of the policy reforms \nClassification   was  undertaken  and  no  potential  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected.  \n   \nRationale  While overall gross domestic product growth has been robust in \nrecent  years,  it  has  not  been  broad-based  or  inclusive.  Of \nparticular  concern  in  this  regard  is  the  poor  performance  of \nagriculture, which has been on a long-term declining growth trend. \nWith about two-thirds of the population deriving their livelihood \nfrom agriculture and nearly three quarters of the poor (or nearly \n200  million)  living  in  rural  areas,  the  impact  of  the  decline  in \nagricultural performance on the quality of life of the poor has been \nsevere.  The  plight  of  the  rural  poor  has  been  thrust  into  the \ninternational spotlight in recent years as a result of suicides by \nhighly indebted farmers and growing rural unrest in many areas. \n \nDevelopment experience has confirmed that rapid, broad-based, \nand labor-intensive economic growth is the best means to reduce \npoverty.  Broad-based  agricultural  growth  offers  enormous \nopportunities for reducing rural poverty by expanding on- and off-\nfarm  employment.  Public  policies,  therefore,  must  continue  to \nreduce  the  deterioration  in  the  rural-urban  terms  of  trade, \nstrengthen social and economic infrastructure in rural areas, and \nrevamp rural finance delivery systems.  \n \nWhile  finance  is  a  critical  input  for  strengthening  the  rural \neconomy and agricultural production base, the response of the \nformal  rural  finance  system  has  been  increasingly  inadequate. \nThe rural finance paradigm for the most part has been driven by \ncredit  expansion  through  government-owned  or  -controlled \nfinancial  institutions,  particularly  within  the  CCS  comprising \nprimary  agricultural  credit  societies,  district  central  cooperative \nbanks (DCCB), and state cooperative banks. While a substantial \n ", "ii   \nnetwork of CCS institutions and an enhanced supply of services \nwere established as a result, the CCS has neither been able to \neffectively address the demand and supply gaps in rural finance, \nnor function as a sustainable financial intermediary. \n \nAlthough organized on the principles of self-governance and self-\nreliance, the CCS has fundamental policy, governance, legal, and \ninstitutional  problems  that  have  impaired  its  solvency, \nsustainability, and efficiency. As a result, the intended objective of \nenhancing rural financial intermediation, especially to the asset-\npoor and disadvantaged, has only been partially realized. The \nprevailing policy and legal environment for the CCS has increased \nthe tolerance for poor financial and operational performance and \nprevented  CCS  members  from  having  their  say  in  the \nmanagement of the CCS institutions.  \n \nRapid rural finance outreach for poverty reduction and improved \nliving standards can be significantly facilitated by revitalizing the \nCCS. CCS reform is critical to rural transformation because it has \nan all India membership base of 135 million and has links to the \nbroader cooperative movement comprising processing, marketing, \ninput  distribution,  dairy,  and  weaving.  Reforming  the  CCS  will \nprovide the institutional base for potentially significant changes in \nthe rural economic and sociopolitical landscape. Legal, regulatory, \ngovernance,  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  to  remove \nthese deep-seated obstacles to enable the CCS to provide more \nefficient and affordable financial services to the poor. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The goal of the Program is to develop a sustainable CCS and the \nobjective is to help the Government carry out its CCS reform \nagenda. Its impact is enhanced income and employment growth \nfor the rural poor, while its purpose is to improve rural households\u2019 \naccess to affordable financial services through an efficient CCS. \nThe  scope  is  comprehensive  CCS  reform  in  five  states  (from \namong  Andhra  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra, \nRajasthan,  Gujarat,  and  Orissa)  that  have  concurred  with  the \nreform agenda. The estimated adjustment cost of implementing \nthe Program in the five participating states (PS) is about $1.43 \nbillion. \nPolicy Framework and  The  Program  has  three  components:  (i)  establishing  a  policy \nActions   reform and implementation framework; (ii) building a facilitating \nlegal, regulatory, and governance framework; and (iii) institutional \nreforms for sustainability.   \nFinancing Plan   ADB will provide a loan of $1.0 billion from its ordinary capital \nresources with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nand an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate-based lending facility, including a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n ", "  iii   \n \nParallel Financing   On behalf of the Government of Germany, the German Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (KfW)  has  worked  with  ADB \nsince 2003 on developing the CCS reform framework, which led \nthem to agree to jointly support the Program for CCS reform in \nfive PSs with ADB. KfW has earmarked at least \u20ac140 million for \nsupporting CCS reform. Of this, \u20ac10 million will be reserved for \ntechnical assistance (TA). KfW\u2019s cofinancing will be provided in a \nparallel financing arrangement.  \nProgram Period and  The proposed loan will be released in four tranches. The first \nTranching  tranche ($250 million) will be released upon loan effectiveness, \nthe second tranche ($250 million) within 12 months of the first \ntranche, the third tranche ($300 million) within 12 months of the \nsecond tranche, and the fourth tranche ($200 million) within 12 \nmonths  of  the  third  tranche  subject  to  compliance  with  the \nconditions for their release. KfW\u2019s assistance will be synchronized \nwith  ADB.  The  first  disbursement  (indicatively,  \u20ac65  million)  is \nexpected in mid-2007 and will be based on KfW\u2019s assessment of \nthe  progress  of  Program  implementation.  Subsequent  tranche \nreleases will be in tandem with those of ADB. \nTechnical Assistance  A TA grant from the Government of the United Kingdom, through \nthe Department for International Development, in the amount of \n$2.0 million is attached to the Program to (i) assist the setting up \nand  implementation  of  the  program  performance  monitoring \nsystem,  (ii)  build  capacity  of  the  state-  and  district-level \nimplementation  units,  (iii)  introduce  innovative  schemes  to \nenhance credit outreach to poor rural women, and (iv) assess \nimplementation progress. Consultant recruitment for the TA grant \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  \nProcurement   The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full \nforeign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of \nimports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, \nother than those in the list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n   \nExecuting Department  The implementation mechanism has been designed on a modular \nand Implementation  basis,  in  line  with  the  structure  of  the  reform  process  that \nArrangements  stipulates uniform content in each PS within the overall policy \nframework. The Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be \nthe executing department for the Program and the National Bank \nfor  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency.  \n \nThe Ministry of Finance will release ADB and KfW loan funds to \nNABARD and will take overall responsibility for program financial \nmanagement  and  reporting.  NABARD  will  oversee  day-to-day \nimplementation of the Program and disbursements to the CCS. \n ", "iv   \nHigh-level coordination of the reform effort will be provided by the \nNational  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Committee,  which  for \nProgram purposes will be the steering committee. The state-level \nimplementation committees to be established in the PSs will serve \nas state steering committees and coordinate the efforts of the \ndistrict-level implementation committees.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds generated from the loan will be used to meet \nthe costs associated with the reform agenda.  \nBenefits   Because the problems in the CCS impose significant social and \neconomic  costs,  the  benefits  of  reform  are  potentially  large. \nEnhanced  access  by  rural  households  to  affordable  financial \nservices and related improvement in rural growth and employment \ncould potentially benefit nearly 41 million CCS members in the \nPSs and about 160 million members of their households. \n \nFinancial  institutions  can  respond  to  growth  opportunities  only \nwhen they operate in a favorable policy environment, and are \nappropriately  governed,  organized,  and  equipped.  Program \nreforms  will  provide  this  critical  link.  While  ensuring  prudent \nlending  and  investment  decisions  through  formal  regulation  of \nstate cooperative banks and DCCBs, the Program will also help \nharmonize  and  strengthen  CCS  regulation.  Nonprudential \noversight and independent audits of the vast network of primary \nagricultural credit societies through the DCCBs will provide cost-\neffective  supervision  appropriate  for  small  rural  finance \ninstitutions. \n \nAnchored  in  an  overall  strategy  of  inclusive  growth,  the  most \nsignificant social benefit of CCS reform is the start of a shift in the \nrural  economy  by  empowering  small  and  marginal  farmers  to \nmeaningfully  and  substantially  participate  in,  and  benefit  from, \ndevelopment. The recognition of the CCS as a central institution \nfor rural transformation allows low-income households to realize \nsignificant social capital and equity gains in India\u2019s hierarchical \nrural social context. Restoring control of the CCS to its members \nand  encouraging  improved  governance,  transparency,  and \noperational performance are expected to bring major changes to \nthe rural economic landscape.  \nSocial and   At  the  macro  level,  the  poverty  reduction  goal  is  supported \nEnvironmental Issues  through greater access to affordable and sustainable rural finance \nservices, which in turn will facilitate better access to productive \nresources  (e.g.,  farm  inputs,  improved  technologies,  and  rural \ninfrastructure). This will increase rural household incomes through \n(i)  higher  returns  from  farming;  (ii)  greater  employment  of  the \nlandless;  (iii)  higher  responsiveness  to  emerging  nonfarm \nenterprise  opportunities;  and  (iv)  increased  accumulation  of \nfinancial assets and, therefore, improved risk management at the \nhousehold level. \n ", "  v   \nAffordable rural finance will also help the rural poor to (i) start or \nexpand productive enterprises; (ii) shift from irregular, low-paid \ndaily labor to more diversified employment sources; and (iii) plan \nfor  routine  expenses,  cope  with  sudden  external  shocks,  and \nbetter cover unanticipated expenses. These trends will also help \nintegrate the rural poor into the mainstream economy, and build \nlonger term defense mechanisms against poverty at household, \ngroup, and village levels, which will be particularly important for \nwomen. \n \nThe poverty and social assessment identified no persons that will \nbe negatively affected in terms of ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples. The Program is category C in \nboth areas. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  CCS  reform  entails  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory, \ngovernance, and institutional issues exacerbated by longstanding \npolitical interference. At the macro level, the consensus as well as \nthe  progress  on  the  reform  agenda  is  driven  by  the  growing \nrecognition by stakeholders of the significance of improving rural \nliving standards where most people live. While this is the most \neffective measure to ensure sustained commitment at all levels for \nprogram  implementation,  achieving  the  expected  impacts  will \ndepend  on  several  assumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying \ndegrees of risk. \n \nDespite the Government\u2019s positive track record in reforming the \ncommercial banks and regional rural banks, there are risks in \ndealing  with  the  CCS,  particularly  the  likelihood  that  state \ngovernments will waver in their commitment to reform. These risks \nare addressed in part by front loading the conditions relating to the \npolicy  reform,  upfront  legal  assurances,  and  phased  financial \nassistance. \n \nIntensive  efforts  to  harmonize  policies  that  affect  the  CCS \nunderscore  the  different  paradigms  for  the  CCS  held  by \nGovernment  and  the  PSs.  Maintaining  this  convergence, \nparticularly on the part of the PSs, requires clear priorities as well \nas  deft  political  management  to  balance  the  urgent  need  for \nreform  with  the  need  to  maintain  social  stability,  especially  in \nresource-poor areas.  \n \nThe  Program  envisages  financial  support  for  cleaning  the \naccumulated losses upon completion of the special audits and \nprogress  on  legal  enactments  and  institutional  reforms.  This, \nnevertheless, entails a moral-hazard risk that PSs and recipient \nCCS institutions may not follow through on the subsequent reform \nand institutional restructuring commitments, or may even renege \non previous reforms. To mitigate this risk, the state governments \nwill  provide  their  own  financial  contributions  to  CCS  reform \nupfront,  and  will  thus  have  a  greater  interest  at  that  stage  in \n ", "vi   \nseeing the process continue to move forward. Moreover, many of \nthe reforms have to be legislated and would prove more difficult to \nreverse.  In  addition,  the  CCS  institutions  will  also  adhere  to \nprudential regulations and be subject to performance ratings as \nwell as mandatory inspections under the banking laws.  \n \nStaff  behavior  could  also  prove  resistant  to  reform,  thereby \nthwarting the expected improvements in financial performance. \nFactors that mitigate these risks include (i) upfront commitment on \nthe governance framework, autonomy, and professionalization of \nboards; (ii) redefinition of the institutional mission and vision; (iii) \nreduction of cost overheads; and (iv) significant investments in \nsystems  and  procedures  (e.g.,  accounting  and  information \nsystems), and human resources development. \n \nEfficient management of the reform process is crucial to avoid \ndisruption  of  service  delivery  while  reducing  pervasive  rural \npoverty and farmer distress. Implementation risk will be minimized \nby  engaging  an  independent  agency  to  assess  reform \nimplementation. NABARD will provide the skills to implement the \nreforms and monitor CCS performance as well as support the \nstate-level  CCS  reform  implementation  mechanisms.  NABARD \nalso  has  a  nationwide  presence  and  maintains  an  extensive \ndatabase on the CCS. \n  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to India for the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program (the \nProgram), and (ii) proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for \nRural Cooperative Credit Structure Reform.  \n   \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n \n2.  Growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remained robust in fiscal year (FY) 20051 at \nabout 8.4% owing to continued strong expansion of industrial output and services. While export \nperformance also remained strong because of high global commodity prices and the elimination \nof textile quotas, the external current account deficit widened to 1.3% of GDP due to higher oil \nprices.  Foreign  exchange  reserves,  nevertheless,  remained  healthy  at  about  $155  billion \nbecause of steady increases in both foreign direct and portfolio investment. However, the \nconsolidated  fiscal  deficit,  which  decreased  by  more  than  a  percentage  point  to  7.7%  in \nFY2005, continues to be a concern. Finally, inflation has remained moderate in the 4\u20135% range \nover the past year, but underlying pressures from buoyant domestic demand and higher energy \nprices are strong. \n \n3.  While India\u2019s overall GDP growth has been very strong in recent years and is projected \nto remain in the 7\u20138% range during 2007\u20132009, it has not been broad-based or inclusive. Of \nparticular concern is the poor performance of the agriculture sector. Agricultural growth appears \nto be on a long-term declining trend, falling from an annual average of 3.2% in 1980\u20131992 to \n2.4% in 1993\u20132003 and 1.3% over the past 3 years (against a 10th Five-Year Plan target \ncovering  FY2003\u2013FY2007  of  4%).2  The  deceleration  in  agricultural  growth  appears  to  be \ngeneral across crops and regions, but has been particularly pronounced in the green revolution \nstates that are the breadbasket of the nation,3 and reflects a broadly based deceleration in \nproductivity growth. The low productivity of agriculture stems from a number of factors, including \n(i) slow progress on land reform, (ii) inadequate rural finance and marketing services for farm \nproduce, (iii) small landholdings that are subject to fragmentation, (iv) slow adoption of modern \nagricultural practices and technologies, and (v) inadequate irrigation infrastructure resulting in \nhigh dependence on rainfall (nearly 70% of the total net sown area is rain-fed agriculture). \n \n4.  Although agriculture accounts for less than one quarter of GDP, its importance to the \neconomic, social, and political fabric goes well beyond its contribution to national output. With \nabout two-thirds of India\u2019s people deriving their livelihood from agriculture and nearly three \nquarters of the poor (or nearly 200 million people) living in rural areas, the impact of the long-\nterm decline in agricultural performance on the quality of life of India\u2019s poor has been severe. \nFor example, India\u2019s human development index declined to 127 out of 177 countries in 2005, \nand key social indicators have now fallen well behind the People\u2019s Republic of China and even \nthose in neighboring countries. Life expectancy in India is 7 years less than in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and 11 years less than in Sri Lanka, while mortality for children under 5 is \nalmost three times the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s rate, almost six times Sri Lanka\u2019s rate, and \nis higher than that in Bangladesh and Nepal.4 \n                                                 \n1  FY2005 covers 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006. \n2  The long-term decline of agriculture is described in detail in World Bank. 2004. India: Re-energizing the Agricultural \nSector to Sustain Growth and Reduce Poverty. Washington DC. \n3  Particularly, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. \n4  United Nations. 2005. Human Development Report 2005. New York. \n ", "2   \n5.  The Tenth Plan goal of reducing poverty incidence to 21% by 2007 from 26% in 2000 is, \ntherefore, unlikely to be realized,5 and vast inequalities still exist between rural and urban areas \nthat are reported to have widened in recent years. On the former, a soon-to-be-released report \nfrom the National Sample Survey Organization shows that poverty declined by a mere 0.74% \nduring the 11-year period ending in FY2004. On the latter, per capita expenditure in rural India \nis now less than half that of urban areas, and the rural-urban divide is estimated to have \nwidened significantly across a broad spectrum of social indicators. The plight of the rural poor \nhas been thrust into the international spotlight in recent years as a result of suicides by highly \nindebted farmers6 and growing rural unrest in many areas of the country.7  \n   \n6.  Rapid  and  sustained  agricultural  growth  and  rural  development  continue  to  be  key \ndevelopment priorities of the Government. It intends to gradually dismantle repressive policies \nthat  have  hindered  the  rural  economy  and  perpetuated  social  inequities.  The  National \nAgricultural Policy, the Tenth Plan and its Midterm Assessment, and the Government\u2019s National \nCommon Minimum Program (NCMP),8 all accord high priority to raising agricultural productivity. \nThe  NCMP  has  identified  the  following  priority  areas:  (i)  increased  public  investment  in \nagricultural research and extension, rural infrastructure, and irrigation; (ii) expanded rural credit \navailability with improved coverage of small and marginal farmers; (iii) improved agricultural \ntechnologies for dry-land farming in arid and semi-arid areas; (iv) more effective crop and \nlivestock insurance schemes; and (v) liberalization of marketing controls that depress prices for \nfarmers. A high-powered committee also recently tabled a set of far-reaching proposals on rural \nland reform for the Government\u2019s consideration. In addition, a National Employment Guarantee \nProgram and the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana are being implemented to mitigate \nimmediate concerns on rural poverty.9  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.   Sector Description and Performance  \n \n7.  Demographic Features. Nearly three-fourths of the population, or about 750 million \npeople comprising about 125 million households, live in rural areas. Of the nearly 120 million \nindividual farmholdings comprising 170 million hectares (ha),10 roughly 60% are less than 1 ha, \nwhile another 20% are only 1\u20132 ha. Classified as small farmers, these two groups who work on \n80% of farmholdings cultivate 36% of the cropped area. Overall, nearly two-thirds of the rural \n                                                 \n5  Official poverty estimates are available only every 5 years. The last survey from which poverty results are available \nwas in 1999\u20132000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the incidence of $1-a-day poverty in 2003 \nwas 30.7%, and the absolute number of poor was 326 million; if the $2-a-day poverty line is used, these increase \nto 78.0% and 830 million, respectively. \n6  The key causes of farmer suicides include (i) indebtedness (87%), (ii) deterioration of economic status (74%), (iii) \ncrop failure (41%), and (iv) decline in social position (36%). There is also some evidence to suggest that small and \nmarginal farmers are more likely to commit suicide than larger farmers in the event of crop failures. Indira Gandhi \nInstitute of Development Research. 2006. Suicide of Farmers in Maharashtra. Delhi, unpublished. \n7  Rural unrest accompanied by violent incidents mostly targeting government establishments was reported in 170 of \ndistricts in India in 2005, mainly because of inadequate and inequitable growth leading to growing unemployment \nand underemployment among rural youth.  \n8  The National Common Minimum Program was adopted in May 2004 by the United Progressive Alliance that came \nto power earlier that year. \n9  Both are major nationwide programs. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Program aims to provide \nemployment for 100 days per year to all rural adults. Currently implemented in 200 districts, it will be extended to \nall 593 districts. The Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana is a holistic program that provides credit and subsidy-\nfinanced assets to groups of poor or self-help groups, and skills development and marketing support.  \n10 Farmers are classified as marginal (up to 1 hectare of landholding), small (1\u20132), semi-medium (2\u20134), medium (4\u2013\n10), and large (10 and above). Farmers include owners, owner-cum-tenants, and tenants. About one-third of the \noperational farms constitute tenant farmers, most of whom are poor. \n ", "  3   \nworkforce of 315 million (60% of the total labor force) is engaged in agriculture11 either as \ncultivators or agricultural laborers, with the rest of the rural population engaged in nonfarm \nactivities, including rural enterprises.  \n \n8.  Policy  Setting.  Despite  the  primacy  of  rural  growth  and  development  in  national \ndevelopment plans, the overriding agricultural policy focus remains on food self-sufficiency \nthrough policies of price supports, procurement, subsidized inputs, and public investments in \ninfrastructure, even though domestic grain production has been more than enough to satisfy \nconsumption needs for over a decade. Direct subsidies covering the cost of price supports, \ndistribution, and storage of wheat and rice still amount to about 5% of annual government \nexpenditure. Agricultural product markets also remain heavily regulated, which has limited the \nscope of private sector involvement in the marketing, transport, and storage of agricultural \ncommodities, particularly basic foodstuffs, and reduced incentives for farmers to diversify their \ncropping patterns. However, changes are slowly being ushered in that have facilitated greater \nprivate sector participation in agricultural marketing and trade.  \n \n9.  Emerging Trends. The rural economy is gradually becoming more market-oriented and \ndiversified as conventional agriculture becomes more resource-intensive with higher levels of \npurchased  inputs.  It  is  also  gradually  shifting  toward  high-value  crops  as  well  as  allied \nagricultural activities (particularly agro-processing) and rural nonfarm enterprises. High-value \ncrops and greater value addition in agriculture also require new investments in farm assets \n(such as farm machinery) and rural infrastructure (such as high-efficiency irrigation systems and \nstorage facilities). The global trend toward lower trade barriers and reduced farm support in \ndeveloped  countries  has  helped  to  reorient  agriculture  toward  high-value  commodities  in \nresponse to newly emerging export opportunities. Increased domestic demand for high-value \nagricultural products and processed foods driven by rapid income growth in urban areas also \nprovides  new  market  opportunities.  Initial  steps  to loosen  the  tight  controls  on agricultural \nmarketing are also helping to increase diversification and commercialization. \n \n10.  Composition of Rural Finance System. India\u2019s mostly state-owned or-controlled retail \nrural finance system is one of the largest in the world. The formal supply sources comprise (i) \nover 47,000 rural and semi-urban branches of 98 commercial banks; (ii) 14,372 branches of 196 \nregional rural banks (RRB), and (iii) a cooperative credit structure (CCS) comprising separate \nstructures for short- and long-term credit. The CCS has a combined network of 51 state-level \nbanks,  1,133  district-level  banks  with  about  13,743  branches,  and  about  105,000  credit \nsocieties. The semi-formal sector includes about 800 microfinance institutions, often registered \nas  nonbank  finance  companies  or  cooperative  societies.  The  vast  informal  credit  system \ncomprises  traders,  moneylenders,  pawnbrokers,  rotating  savings  and  credit  associations, \nlandlords, relatives, and friends. The National Agricultural Insurance Company and numerous \ncommodity futures markets (CFM) are also integral to the rural finance system. The formal rural \nfinance sector is described in Appendix 1.  \n \n11.  The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the apex rural \nfinance agency, provides refinance, institutional development, and capacity building, especially \nfor the CCS, RRBs, and microfinance institutions (Appendix 2).12 While the Reserve Bank of \nIndia  (RBI),  the  central  bank,  supervises  and  regulates  the  commercial  banking  system, \n                                                 \n11 Includes crop production and marketing, farm mechanization, land development, irrigation, livestock, and forestry. \n12  The Small Industries Development Bank of India and Rashtriya Mahila Kosh also provide equity and refinance to \nthe microfinance institutions.  \n \n ", "4   \nNABARD, as a second-tier agency, supervises the CCS and RRBs on behalf of the RBI. State \ngovernments also exercise supervisory powers over the CCS.  \n \n12.  Market  Segments.  The  rural  finance  client  market  is  highly  stratified  and  may  be \nclassified into the following broad categories based on landholding and employment patterns: (i) \na lower segment comprising about 75% of the rural population, including small and marginal \nfarmers,  the  landless,  and  farm  and  nonfarm  laborers,  especially  those  with  transitory  or \nseasonal employment; (ii) a middle segment comprising almost 20% of the rural population, \nconsisting mainly of farmers with medium-size land holdings, small traders, and input suppliers; \nand (iii) an upper segment, comprising about 5% of the rural population, including commercial \nfarmers, large plantations, larger rural enterprises, and agriculture produce wholesalers. \n \n13.  Demand Patterns. Reflecting the stratified rural finance market as well as emerging \ntrends, the demand for rural credit has become more diverse both in terms of the activities for \nwhich credit is sought as well as the type and duration of credit. The upper market segment \nseeks  high-end  financial  services  such  as  letters  of  credit,  export  guarantees,  long-term \ninvestment capital, and commodity futures contracts. The middle segment requires working \ncapital, cash credit, loans against pledges of produce, and medium- to long-term loans for crop \ncultivation, rural transport, and land development. The lower market segment requires credit for \nconsumption,  microenterprises,  crop  and  livestock  production,  and  investments  in  minor \nirrigation. The demand for savings is similarly diverse, with the lower segment primarily seeking \nsecurity for their savings, while more affluent households are primarily interested in obtaining \nthe highest investment return. With India now also receiving large remittances ($22 billion in \n2005), rural finance institutions (RFI)13 have a significant opportunity to tap this market. \n \n14.  Formal Rural Finance. The formal rural finance system is broadly segregated into \nfinancial services provided to farm and rural nonfarm households, a large number of which are \npoor. Microfinance, as a subset of rural finance, specifically targets the poor and is primarily \nvillage-based. At the aggregate level, there are roughly 94 million rural borrowers against 300 \nmillion rural savers, including those who save at post offices. The outstanding rural credit at the \nend of FY2005 from formal sources was estimated at Rs4,542 billion ($100 billion), with the \nrelative shares of the commercial banks accounting for 53.0%, the CCS for 38.5%, and RRBs \nfor  8.5%.14  The  interest  rate  on  rural  credit  ranges  from  10.0%  to  20.5%  per  annum  for \ncommercial banks, 7.0% to 15.5% for the CCS,15 and 10.0% to 20.5% for the RRBs. There are \n60 million rural borrowing clients with the CCS, compared to nearly 20 million loan accounts in \nthe commercial banks and 6 million in the RRBs. Rural savings with the commercial banks, \nCCS, and RRBs at the end of March 2005 were Rs6,742 billion ($147 billion). \n15.  With rural credit collectively comprising only about 26% of total bank credit, there is a \nsignificant supply\u2013demand gap despite the extensive rural finance network. With more than \n50% of the CCS in various stages of impairment, the 135 million members reflect potential \nrather  than  actual  outreach.  The  poorest  households  and  women,  in  particular,  have  little \naccess to formal rural finance services for capital formation in the agriculture sector and only \n20% of the lower segment is estimated to have access to the formal rural finance system. This \n                                                 \n13  In this document, unless otherwise specified, RFIs collectively denote commercial banks in rural areas, CCS (both \nshort- and long-term) entities, RRBs, and semiformal arrangements, including microfinance institutions. The term \n\u201cmicrofinance\u201d is used only for specific microfinance-related references. Similarly, wherever relevant, commercial \nbanks are specifically mentioned. \n14 In addition, the estimated $53 million loan portfolio of microfinance institutions comprises a million borrowers. \n15  The range of lending interest rates reflects the varying loan sizes for different purposes issued by different tiers of \nthe CCS. While there is a guideline indicating that the CCS should lend at 7%, this is generally ignored unless \nupfront compensation is provided by the Government to enable retail lending at this rate.  \n ", "  5   \nlack of access can be attributed to factors such as their inability to meet the creditworthiness \nstandards of the formal rural finance system (lack of stable incomes and collateral), as well as \nthe unwillingness of financial institutions to absorb the high transaction costs associated with \nsmall loans.  \n \n16.  The range and scale of services offered through the formal rural finance sector is also \noften  inadequate,  which  further  limits  the  activities  that  can  be  supported,  particularly  the \nproduction of higher value crops and increased value addition by small farmers. In addition, crop \ninsurance, while compulsory for small farm loans, is neither actively pursued nor adequately \nfunded, and thus does not sufficiently mitigate risks. The emergence of several multi-commodity \nfutures exchanges structured in line with international best-practice technology has been a \nparticularly important recent development, but trading volumes remain lower than potential \ndespite rapid growth in recent years. In addition, the exchanges are not closely integrated with \nlocal spot markets, which limits the benefits they provide in terms of risk hedging and price \ndiscovery for small farmers.  \n \n17.  Informal Rural Finance. Even though formal RFIs are physically present in rural areas, \nsmall  farmers  are  unable  to  access  them  because  of  borrower-unfriendly  products  and \nprocedures,  and  high  transaction  costs.  The  lower  segment  of  the  rural  finance  market, \nparticularly the poorest of the poor, must therefore rely on the informal sources for their credit \nneeds. The informal sector comprises a diverse range of actors, including a tightly linked \nnetwork of moneylenders, input suppliers, rural elites, and pawnbrokers. Loans from informal \nsources are often the only means for the poor to raise funds for small investments, life-cycle \nexpenses, and health emergencies as moneylenders generally do not impose restrictions on the \nuse of funds. However, few, if any, productive activities can absorb interest charges ranging up \nto 360% per year and still provide sufficient household income for subsistence.  \n \n18.  As a result of the recent spate of farmer suicides in parts of the country, high-debt levels \namong poor rural households, and other indications of socioeconomic stress, the Government \nhas started cracking down on village moneylenders by declaring their loans illegal and releasing \nfarmers from their debts. As a result, input dealers have geared up to meet the credit gap by \nproviding farm inputs tied to the buyback of farm outputs. Their domination of local social and \neconomic relations enables the dealers to control input and output prices, which often traps poor \nhouseholds in a web of indebtedness and is a major determinant of pervasive rural poverty. The \nbargaining power of the informal suppliers is inversely correlated with the density and reach of \nthe formal rural finance sector and its willingness to meet the local demand for credit. \n \n19.  Self-Help Groups and Outreach to Women. Alternative arrangements for enhancing \nrural finance outreach to the poor have been explored by nongovernment organizations (NGO) \nsince the mid-1970s. In the early stages, NGOs played a pivotal role in implementing and \ninnovating the self-help group (SHG) model. Based on the \u201cself-help\u201d concept, small groups of \n10 to 20 women are formed to operate businesses by using members\u2019 savings to fund loans. In \nthe 1980s, policymakers took notice and worked with development organizations and bankers to \npromote these savings and credit groups. Accordingly, NABARD initiated a pilot program in \n1992, the SHG Bank Linkage program, for establishing SHGs and linking them to RFIs. While \nNGOs facilitate the formation and capacity building of SHGs, NABARD provides refinance to \nRFIs to lend to SHGs. The program has expanded dramatically from 500 to 1.6 million SHGs \nwith over 24 million borrowers, of whom 90% are poor rural women.  \n \n20.  NABARD  has  also  supported  the  formation  of  women-only  SHGs  and  introduced \nexclusive schemes that link credit to poor women with identification of appropriate economic \nactivities such as (i) Assistance to Rural Women in Nonfarm Development, and (ii) Assistance \n ", "6   \nfor Marketing of Nonfarm Products of Rural Women. By providing grants since 1995, NABARD \nhas  supported  the  establishment  of  women  development  cells  in  RRBs  and  the  CCS  to \nstrengthen credit delivery and provide credit and services to women. The incentives for RFIs to \nparticipate  in  these  schemes  include  100%  refinance  support,  grants  to  develop  gender-\nresponsive information systems, and training programs to sensitize their staff to gender issues. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n \n1.  Issues \n \n21.  The rural finance paradigm for the most part has been driven by credit expansion \nthrough government-owned or controlled RFIs. While a substantial network of RFIs and an \nenhanced supply of rural finance services have been established, the system has not been able \nto meet the diverse demand for services for the majority of rural households. The Government\u2019s \nrole in rural finance market development was intended to increase lending by reducing the cost \nand risks for RFIs lending to preferred clients. While the upper segments of the rural finance \nmarket can access the rapidly modernizing urban and peri-urban financial markets through the \ncommercial banks, the access to formal credit for other rural residents, particularly the poor, \nhave not improved in any significant manner. The investments in RFIs have thus bypassed \nlarge parts of the market and neither rapid economic transformation nor equitable development \ncould take place. \n \n22.  Cooperative Credit Structure. Established in 1904 to free farmers from indebtedness \nand poverty, the CCS has evolved into one of the largest rural finance systems in the world, with \nabout 135 million members, of whom nearly 60 million are borrowers. The CCS is considered \nthe  binding  factor  for  the  broader  cooperative  movement  in  India,  which  includes  crop \nproduction, processing, marketing, input distribution, dairying, weaving, and textiles. The reach \nof the CCS thus directly or indirectly extends to nearly half of the population of 1 billion. The \nCCS is also generally credited with facilitating the green revolution in India. With agriculture as \nthe main means of subsistence, the significance of the CCS in the country\u2019s political economy is \nimmense. The vast scale and achievements of the CCS ensure government support but have \ninevitably led to poltical interference in its functioning.  \n \n23.  Structure. The CCS for short-term credit has at its base the 105,735 primary agriculture \ncredit societies (PACS),16 dealing mainly in credit. The PACSs are federated into 368 district \ncentral cooperative banks (DCCB), which in turn are members of 31 state cooperative banks \n(SCB). For the long-term credit system, there are 20 state cooperative agriculture and rural \ndevelopment banks (SCARDB) with 887 branches and 768 primary cooperative agriculture and \nrural development banks (PCARDB), or retail branches federated with the SCARDBs. In some \nstates, the CCS for short-term credit has no DCCBs, while in others, the CCS for short-term \ncredit also covers the long-term structure. The overall CCS structure is described in Appendix 1.  \n \n24.  Legal Framework. As cooperatives are a state subject under the Constitution, CCS \ninstitutions are registered as societies under state-specific cooperatives societies acts (CSA). \nSome  states  have  also  enacted  mutually  aided  cooperatives  societies  acts  (MACSA)  for \nregistering  cooperative  societies  that  transact  business  only  with  members,  have  no  state \ngovernment contribution, and do not borrow from or use state government guarantees for \nborrowing. In contrast, nonmembers have significant stakes in the CCS and state governments \nlargely  manage  them.  The  CCS  is  required  to  elect  board  members  and  lower  tiers  are \ngenerally majority owners of the next highest tier. Only borrowing members have voting rights. \n                                                 \n16  In addition, there are multi-purpose farmers\u2019 service societies with a larger area of operation compared to PACSs.  \n ", "  7   \nThe lower tiers for the most part have to borrow from\u2014and invest in\u2014the next highest tier. \nWhile PACSs and PCARDBs are exclusively retail entities, retail services are also provided by \nthe higher tiers.  \n \n25.  Outreach. The total membership of the PACSs is about 120 million\u2014of whom 42% are \nsmall and marginal farmers and 37% are from marginalized social groups\u2014with 51 million \nborrowing members. The total membership in the SCARDBs and PCARDBs is 15 million, with \nabout  9  million  borrowing  members.  The  CCS  accounts  for  one-third  of  rural  saving  and \nprovides one-quarter of investment credit and about half of agriculture production credit, thus \nmeeting about one-third of overall agricultural credit needs. It also provides credit for fertilizer \nproduction,  input  marketing,  yarn  weaving  and  processing,  sugar  manufacturing,  and  milk \nproduction  and  processing.  In  states  such  as  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Gujarat, \nChattisgarh, and Haryana, the CCS provides more than 50% of the formal credit for agriculture. \nIn comparison, the commercial banks have about 20 million agricultural borrowers. The average \nrural loan size of the commercial banks ($2,573) and CCS ($633) suggests that the potential \noutreach of the CCS is much deeper than that of the commercial banks given the predominance \nof small farmers. \n26.  Impairment. While the CCS is organized on the principle of self-governing and self-\nreliant organizations, its policy, governance, legal, and institutional framework adversely affects \nits solvency, sustainability, and efficiency. As a result, the intended objective of enhancing rural \nfinancial intermediation, especially to the asset-poor and disadvantaged, has only been partially \nrealized.  \n \n(i)  Legal. Democratic functioning is the rationale for establishing cooperatives. The \nCSAs, however, allow the state governments to remove elected representatives \nfrom CCS boards, amalgamate or divide the CCS, and contribute to capital. This \nhas undermined the membership-based character and the CCS is largely run as \na state-owned entity. To retain de facto state control, the extant CSAs, in most \ninstances, contain no provisions for CCS institutions to migrate to the MACSAs.  \n \n(ii)  Poor  governance.  The  state  governments  have  been  the  dominant \nshareholders, managers, regulators, and concurrent supervisors and auditors of \nthe  CCS.  The  state  governments,  through  the  office  of  the  registrar  of \ncooperatives  under  the  CSAs,  supersede  elected  boards  and  appoint \nadministrators,  thus  assuming  powers  to  approve  staffing  patterns,  staff \nrecruitment, emoluments, asset purchases, and business and pricing decisions. \nChange in governments at state level is often followed by reconstituted boards of \nCCS institutions with a new set of government nominees and elections are either \ndelayed or do not take place at all. In addition, audits are delayed and their \nrecommendations not followed.17 There are no accounting codes for PACSs. \n \n(iii)  Reverse paradigm. The rural finance policy paradigm of the state governments \nthat  set  the  norms  and  incentives  for  the  CCS  impedes  viable  financial \nintermediation. The PACSs and PCARDBs at the base level primarily dispense \ncredit. Because of this, the upper tiers were created to ensure adequate supply \nof financial resources. Credit orientation is perpetuated by giving voting rights \nonly to borrowers. Excluding the majority (i.e., depositors) is a conflict of interest \nas borrowers dominate all business decisions, which undermines sustainability.  \n                                                 \n17  For instance, (i) no elections have been held in the CCS across all tiers for 10 years or more in three states; (ii) \nboards of 9 out of 31 SCBs, and 134 out of 368 DCCBs, have been superseded by the registrar of cooperatives; \nand (iii) audits have been pending in at least 15% of the PACSs for more than a year.    \n ", "8   \n(iv)  Regulatory forbearance. SCBs and DCCBs are classified as banks under the \nBanking Regulation Act of 1949 since they mobilize public savings.18 However, \nprudential norms cannot be effectively enforced since the CSA empowers the \nregistrar  of  cooperatives  to  override  or  delay  implementation  of  RBI \nrecommendations. Prevailing prudential norms for SCBs and DCCBs are not \ncomparable  to  commercial  banks.19  The  resulting  regulatory  arbitrage  and \nforbearance perpetuates poor governance and insolvency in the CCS. The status \nquo allows state governments to disregard their obligations to the CCS and \nperiodically declare waivers of interest and principal and interfere to delay or \ndilute loan repayments. These adversely affect credit discipline. \n  \n(v)  Poor  portfolio  quality.  As  a  result  of  weak  portfolio  management, \nnonperforming assets have shown an increasing trend in absolute terms as well \nas a proportion of the loan portfolio.20 For the short-term CCS, nonperforming \nassets were 36% of outstanding loans on 31 March 2004. Overall, nearly 75% of \nthe CCS institutions have loan repayment rates21 of less than 60%.22 Portfolios \nremain vulnerable since three-fourths of CCS credit is for crop loans.  \n \n(vi)  Recurring losses. Poor portfolio performance translates into systemic losses. \nFive SCBs, more than 28% of DCCBs, and 49% of PACSs reported losses in \nFY2004.23 In addition, 47% of SCARDBs and 63% of PCARDBs incurred losses. \nEight out of 31 SCBs and 144 out of 368 DCCBs have eroded their net worth.  \n \n(vii)  Deposit erosion. Of the $32 billion of deposits with the CCS, nearly 56% is from \nthe public (i.e., other than members of the CCS), with the rest from institutions. \nSCBs and DCCBs are required to protect individual depositors with a cover of up \nto $2,145 by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India. \nHowever, deposits of lower tiers with higher tiers (PACSs to DCCBs and DCCBs \nto SCBs) are treated as institutional deposits and hence are not eligible for \ncoverage.  The  magnitude  of  risk  is  compounded  since  losses  in  SCBs  and \nDCCBs have eroded nearly $1 billion of deposits over and above the erosion of \ntheir net worth.24 A good proportion of savings mobilized by PACSs ($4 billion) is \nfrom nonmembers even though they are not permitted to accept public deposits \nand despite their precarious financial position. \n \n(viii)  Competitive disadvantage. CCS borrowers have to subscribe to share capital. \nSince the CCS is unable to pay dividends, the effective cost of borrowing may \nexceed the cost charged by commercial banks. However, this does not translate \ninto higher net profits because the CCS pays higher interest rates on deposits. \nTransaction and risk costs are also higher because of small loan sizes and high \nportfolio concentration in agriculture. As a result, larger borrowers with good \ncredit records tend to borrow from commercial banks and RRBs. \n                                                 \n18 The Banking Regulation Act does not govern the PACSs and the CCS for long-term credit given that neither are \nmandated to mobilize public savings (i.e., from non-members). \n19  The SCBs and DCCBs are, however, subject to submission of regular returns on their financial status and \noperations, compliance with which is weak. \n20  Nonperforming assets are defined differently for the CCS\u2014they cover only the amount of default from the lower \ntiers and not the entire outstanding amount in the defaulted account, which results in an understatement.  \n21 Repayment rate in this document refers to collection as percentage of loans due.  \n22  SCBs: 84% (nonperforming assets 18%); DCCBs: 62% (nonperforming assets 23%); and 62% for PACSs.  \n23  The current profits or losses could be misleading, especially since some institutions reporting profits could have \nheavy accumulated losses and may also not be making required provisions.   \n24  Data on deposit erosion in the PACSs, however, are not available because of inadequate financial records. \n ", "  9   \n \n(ix)  Institutional  constraints.  The  CCS  has  made  inadequate  investments  in \nenhancing  systems  and  procedures,  products  and  services,  information \ntechnology platforms, and skills development of staff. Consequently, the lack of \nstandardized  business  models  and  risk  mitigation  systems  and  procedures, \nincluding  for  asset  and  liability  management,  compound  CCS  management \nproblems. Overstaffing and lack of professionalism further increase overhead \nand transaction costs. Weak systems and procedures also result in fraud and \nembezzlement either not being detected or not followed up. \n \n(x)  Inappropriate incentives. NABARD refinance, which accounts for nearly 40% of \nthe retail lending of the CCS, is perceived as a government commitment to the \nrural  sector  rather  than  as  a  financial  obligation  that  needs  to  be  managed \nprudently and repaid. The refinance is guaranteed by the state governments and \nrolled over perpetually.25 With continued deterioration in the financial position of \nthe CCS, dependence on NABARD refinance is growing. The CCS would largely \nbecome inoperative if NABARD were to recall its refinance.  \n \n(xi)  Information asymmetry. Ineffective information systems to screen credit risks \nadd  to  the  overall  transaction  costs  in  the  CCS.  The  absence  of  adequate \ninformation often leads to restricted services to potential clients, particularly the \npoor, where information gaps are most severe. \n \n27.  The weaknesses of the CCS have immense adverse economic, social, and political \nimpacts on the rural sector. In particular, they accentuate the demand and supply gap and \nregional disparities in rural finance service delivery, given its vast network and membership \nbase.  As  the  major  institutional  provider  of  agriculture  production  credit,  the  deteriorating \nfinancial and institutional status of the CCS adversely affects the backward (inputs) and forward \n(marketing)  linkages  and  their  integration  with  the  multipurpose  service  concept  of  the \ncooperative system. Moreover, lack of autonomy and poor governance have allowed political \ncontrol of the CCS, resulting in decisions being taken with impunity for political gains, including \nuncompensated waivers of interest and principal. The CCS institutions, in turn, are unable to \noperate as \u201clocal\u201d institutions or meet the needs of their membership. \n \n28.  Other RFIs. Other RFIs have not been able to compensate for the weaknesses of the \nCCS and fill the void in rural financial services. Although the commercial banks have been \nsystematically strengthened since 1991 and have registered the most impressive growth in rural \nsavings and credit, their orientation is toward larger loans and more populous areas. The high \ntransaction  costs  for  small  loans  adversely  affect  the  access  to  financial  services  from \ncommercial banks by the weaker segments of the village level rural finance market.26 Political \ninterference in the CCS also deters the commercial banks from expanding their rural portfolios. \nWhile the overall performance of the RRBs is improving following the recapitalization support \nprovided in 1995\u20131999, continued institutional strengthening will be required to consolidate their \nposition and significantly extend their outreach. \n \n29.  The nonbank RFIs have also yet to extend their outreach to the rural poor in any \nsignificant  manner.  Although  the  CFMs  now  comprise  24  exchanges,  segmentation  by \ncommodity, regional dispersal, and separate spot and forward markets have impeded more \nremunerative  prices  and  improved  marketing  efficiency  for  small  agricultural  producers. \n                                                 \n25  Without the state government guarantees on refinance to the CCS, NABARD\u2019s portfolio could be considered weak. \n26  These include small and marginal farmers, landless laborers, artisans, and service providers at the village level.  \n ", "10  \nAddressing these concerns will require effective market regulation and stronger downstream \nsystems for price discovery and integration of small farmers. The ongoing National Agricultural \nInsurance Scheme, which covers food crops, oilseeds, and selected commercial crops, has had \nonly a limited impact on reducing vulnerability of rural households as it only provides coverage \nto 18 million farmers (out of 120 million).  \n \n  2.  Opportunities  \n \n30.  Development  experience  indicates  that  rapid,  broad-based,  and  labor-intensive \neconomic growth is the most effective means to reduce poverty. In particular, broad-based \nagricultural growth offers enormous opportunities for reducing rural poverty by expanding on- \nand off-farm employment. To succeed, agriculture policies must continue to improve the rural\u2013\nurban terms of trade, strengthen social and economic infrastructure in rural areas, and find ways \nto spur timely completion of ongoing irrigation projects. At the same time, the efficiency of rural \nfinance intermediation and access of the poor to formal credit channels must also improve if \nrural living standards are to be enhanced. Indeed, there is growing consensus, based on \ntheoretical and empirical work, that better access to affordable finance can be an extraordinarily \neffective tool for promoting inclusive growth. \n \n31.  India has witnessed a visible shift in financial sector policies since the 1990s.27 The key \nactions that helped reshape India\u2019s financial system were: in banking (i) the gradual freeing of \ninterest rates, (ii) entry of private sector banks and easing of restriction on foreign banks, and \n(iii) phasing out of the preferential access of development finance institutions to funds; and in \nthe capital market (i) easing of controls, particularly with respect to the pricing of equity issues, \nand (ii) entry of foreign institutional investors. In conjunction with liberalization, measures were \ntaken to strengthen regulation and supervision, among others: in banking (i) phased compliance \nwith  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  Basel  Committee  recommendations  on  capital \nadequacy; and (ii) tightening of prudential norms with respect to income recognition, asset \nclassification,  and  provisioning.  More  recently,  the  passage  of  the  Securitization  and \nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interests Act has strengthened \nthe capacity of the banks to enforce security and reduce build up of nonperforming loans but \npriority sector lending requirements continue on commercial banks.  \n \n32.  The capital market28 has undergone unprecedented reform and has been transformed \nfrom  a  fragmented,  archaic,  inefficient,  and  highly  unregulated  market  into  an  integrated, \nmodern,  and  centrally  regulated  system  with  improved  depth  and  liquidity.  Liberalization \nmeasures have led to the development of institutional investment and growth of the mutual \nfunds industry and the opening up of the insurance industry. The Government is currently \nconsidering major proposals for reform of the pension funds systems. The use of derivative \ninstruments has gained considerable ground. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has \nalso  been  strengthened  and  vested  with  the  required  authority  and  standards  have  been \nupgraded to conform to best practices in many respects. A sizeable government securities \nmarket has been in operation for quite some time.  \n \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 1992.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Capital Market Development Program Loan. Manila (Loan 1408-IND for $250 million, approved on 28 \nNovember 1995) supported the reform and modernization of the domestic capital market.   \n ", "  11   \n33.  The reform measures have led to increased allocative efficiency of the financial system \nwith greater reliance on private sector participation and market forces, brought about by a \nreduction in intermediation costs, enhanced competition, and increased diversity of products \nand services. While these reforms have been mainstreamed in the commercial banks and the \ncapital market, and introduced among the RRBs, the CCS has remained at the periphery of \nthese reforms. In a rapidly modernizing financial sector, the CCS has come under greater \nscrutiny. The recurring financial drain in pursuit of the old rural finance paradigm and narrowing \nfiscal space in the states have also prompted a shift in strategy that now seeks to develop viable \nintermediaries for enhancing rural finance outreach and development impacts. In this context, \nthe  Government  is  also  considering  enacting  legislation  conducive  for  the  microfinance \ninstitutions. \n \n34.  Having been inordinately delayed, CCS reform will now have to be undertaken in the \ncontext of a sharp rural-urban divide and deteriorating social conditions in the countryside \n(paras.  3\u20136).  The  reform  agenda  will  thus  have  to  be  carefully  sequenced  to  forge  the \nstakeholder consensus necessary to sustain the reforms and to maintain social stability. In \nparticular, given the long-term declining trend of agricultural growth, the reform process must \nnot side track the slow improvement in the rural\u2013urban terms of trade witnessed since the early \n1990s. Some reform areas, such as the liberalization of agricultural pricing, including of rural \ncredit,29  can  therefore  only  be  introduced  gradually  given  the  need  to  safeguard  the \ncompetitiveness of the rural economy (paras. 41\u201342). It is vitally important that the Government \nmove ahead with complementary measures for rural development (e.g., increased investment in \nrural infrastructure and liberalization of agricultural markets) given the multi-dimensional nature \nof the problem and the significant links outside the rural economy. The real sector reform \nagenda in agriculture (paras. 6 and 8, and Appendix 1) would impact on CCS reform positively \nshould the former be successful in creating a dynamic and flourishing agricultural sector. Hence, \nthe need for careful calibration and sequencing of reforms. \n \n35.  Government Strategy. Reform of the rural finance sector, therefore, emerged as a \ncritical  concern  and  strategic  priority  for  all  stakeholders  in  the  context  of  the  National \nAgricultural  Policy,  the  Tenth  Plan,  and  the  NCMP.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprovided TA30 to develop a comprehensive rural finance reform agenda, comprising the CCS, \nRRBs, risk mitigation regimes, and CFMs. The TA study concluded that the immediate reform \nfocus should be on the CCS in view of the enormous potential benefits and critical economic \nlinkages. Priority attention was also recommended for CFM development and crop insurance to \nfacilitate  improved  coverage  of  the  main  risks  small  farmers  face.  These  findings  were \nconsistent with the Government priority of providing quality services to rural clients in view of the \ndemand and supply gap for institutional rural finance services and growing rural\u2013urban income \ndisparities.  The  Government  is  also  considering  enacting  legislation  conducive  for  the \nmicrofinance institutions. \n \n36.  Consensus quickly emerged that the initial reform focus should be on the CCS given the \nabsence of cost-effective and realistic alternatives that could substitute for its potential outreach \nwithin any reasonable time frame. The cost of liquidation, both financial and political, would be \nsignificantly higher than the estimated cost of restructuring the CCS. In particular, the cost of \n                                                 \n29 Dual pricing applies to the CCS. The CCS charges lower lending interest rates as required for loans funded \nthrough NABARD refinance at concessional terms and those where the CCS receives interest rate subsidies from \nstate governments or the Government. In other cases, interest charges are determined by the CCS.  \n30  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Rural Finance Sector Restructuring and Development \nProject. Manila (TA 4247-IND for $1 million, approved on 12 December 2003, financed by the Department of \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom). This TA analyzed the CCS in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, \nAndhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Kerala and designed reforms for two of these states. \n ", "12  \nundefined  pension  liabilities,  staff  redundancies,  the  weak  prospects  for  recovering \nnonperforming assets in the context of liquidation, and the concurrent fiscal impact on the state \ngovernments providing guarantees to CCS borrowings were judged to be too large, while the \neconomic and social dislocations in terms of income and employment losses for both existing \nand potential clients were viewed as untenable. Seeking to increase the rural operations of \ncommercial banks through higher priority sector lending as an alternative to the CCS was also \nconsidered inconsistent with the banking reforms, while rapid expansion of the RRBs was \nunrealistic given its small client base. \n \n37.  The Government ultimately decided that CCS institutions with a reasonable chance of \nbeing revived should be strengthened by addressing the root, rather than proximate causes of \ntheir weak performance. While the short- and long-term CCS have commonalities, based on the \ncredit needs of large numbers of small farmers, the Government felt it prudent to initially focus \non the short-term CCS given its broad outreach (nearly 85% of CCS outreach) and primary \nfocus  on  agricultural  lending.  Accordingly,  the  Government  constituted  a  Task  Force  on \nRevitalization of the Short-term CCS (the Task Force) in August 2004 to develop a countrywide \nreform program. ADB provided backstopping support to the Task Force, and its final report \n(Supplementary Appendix A) submitted on 5 February 2005\u2014which recommended fundamental \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional reforms packaged as an integrated set of measures to be \nimplemented only in states that agree to carry out reforms in their entirety\u2014was consistent with \nthe earlier ADB TA findings. The underlying reform principles are as follows: \n \n(i)  A conducive policy and legal environment must be in place to enable the CCS to \noperate as self-governing and financially viable institutions. \n  \n(ii)  The state governments should voluntarily cede control of the CCS.  \n \n(iii)  Supervision  and  regulation  of  the  CCS  must  be  significantly  enhanced  with \neffective enforcement of RBI recommendations for CCS entities classified as \nbanks. \n \n(iv)  Financial assistance should be provided for cleaning up accumulated losses to \nrestore the value of members\u2019 capital in the CCS and given as a grant (not \nequity)  by  the  Government  and  state  governments  as  a  one-time,  phased \nmeasure linked to policy, legal, and institutional reforms.  \n \n(v)  Only those institutions that meet defined criteria are eligible for reform assistance \nto  ensure  prudent  use  of  public  resources.  Institutions  with  no  turnaround \nprospects should be amalgamated or wound up.  \n \n(vi)  Support to PACSs needs to be prioritized since restructuring the intermediate \nand upper tiers without addressing the infirmities of the lowest tier is impractical. \n  \n(vii)  Institutional turnaround needs to be in the context of action plans with financial \nand operational benchmarks.  \n \n38.  The  Government,  through  an  intensive  consultative  process,  accepted  the \nrecommendations in principle and placed them before the National Development Council at its \nmeeting of 27 June 2005. The Task Force report and its recommendations were subsequently \ndiscussed in depth at a special meeting of the state chief ministers on 9 September 2005. A \ndraft statement of the consensus emerging from the deliberations was then prepared and \ndiscussed  with  the  finance  and  cooperation  ministers  of  selected  state  governments.  This \nmeeting was held on 29 September 2005, where the consensus was further crystallized into a \n ", "  13   \nformal  statement  of  consensus,  following  which  the  finance  minister  conveyed  to  all  state \ngovernments a comprehensive CCS reform package. Ten states31 have conveyed concurrence \nwith the reform agenda thus far, which is expected to be formalized through memorandums of \nunderstanding (MOU) between the Government, respective state governments, and NABARD \n(Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n39.  The initial estimate of the aggregate cost of reform of the short-term CCS is $3,021 \nmillion. The Government has agreed to meet 68% ($2,054 million)32 of the estimated cost and \nthe balance is expected to be shared by the state governments ($846 million or 28%) and the \nCCS ($121 million or 4%). Of the total cost, $2,792 million (92%) is for cleaning up accumulated \nlosses and $229 million (8%) is for audit, human resource development, and technological \nsupport. In view of the large costs, the Government requested external funding agencies to \nsubstantially support CCS reform. Considering its involvement with CCS reform since 2003, the \nGovernment requested ADB support for CCS reforms in five states. The German Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (KfW) agreed to jointly support the reforms with ADB, while \nthe World Bank is also expected to provide financial support for CCS reform in 2007. \n \n40.  The CCS should have been reformed much earlier to minimize the financial and social \ncosts given its persistent weakness. However, the rural political economy did not allow policy, \nlegal, and incentive structures to change during previous attempts to reform the CCS. Those \nreform efforts inevitably failed and it was generally accepted that the CCS would always be in \nneed of financial support to sustain its operations. This perpetuated a vicious circle where the \npoorly performing CCS could not provide affordable finance to the poor, while the political \ninterference in CCS operations inhibited market entry by other financial entities. In such an \nenvironment, state government participation and commitment to share the cost of reform is a  \nmajor achievement. \n \n41.  Given that the CCS has largely operated under state control, fostering a shift to quality of \nservice  and  sustainability  will  be  a  major  endeavor.  Even  though  the  MOUs  between  the \nGovernment and state governments emphasize autonomy for the CCS in business decisions, \ntheir transformation into this new role will take some time. In particular, the CCS continues to be \nexposed to concessional interest rates and occasional waivers of loans under government \ndirectives. While CCS reform process intends to terminate this practice, the political economy \nwill allow full commercialization to be phased in only gradually. In an environment of heightened \nrural discontent, a sudden upward shift in lending rates could worsen tensions that could delay \nand ultimately sidetrack CCS reform.  \n \n42.  To phase out the role of state governments and support the move to full autonomy, the \nGovernment  and  state  governments,  as  part  of  the  CCS  reform  agenda,  have  already \ncommitted  to  compensate  the  CCS  upfront  and  transparently  through  the  budget  for  any \ndirective to provide services below cost and forego receivables. The explicit recognition of this \nfinancial obligation will eventually result in the phase out of such interventions, given the need to \ncontain  fiscal  deficits  over  the  medium  term  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement and Budget Responsibility Act (2003), while providing the necessary financial and \noperational autonomy to the CCS in the interim. The CCS has already begun resisting directives \nrequiring unviable transactions without committed compensation in any event, indicating that \nprogress toward sustainability is already under way. Until such time as the rural sector catches \n                                                 \n31  Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab Rajasthan, Sikkim, and Tamil \nNadu.  \n32 This is only an overall proportion. The sharing patterns differ across states based on the relative size of cost items \nidentified to be financed by the Government, state governments, and the CCS.  \n ", "14  \nup with the rest of the economy, reform of the CCS should proceed carefully, while ensuring that \nthe state pays for any public policy objectives that it wants to achieve through the CCS. \n \n43.  The results achieved through CCS reform will also depend on the effectiveness with \nwhich they are implemented. Implementation has already begun, including (i) the signing of \nMOUs, (ii) initial budgetary provisions of about $400 million by the Government and state \ngovernments,  (iii)  preparatory  work  to  enhance  the  legal  reforms  pending  enactment  of \nlegislation, and (iv) assignment of auditors to determine a consistent bottom line for the financial \nrestructuring.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  setting  up  the  nationwide  implementation \nmechanism, including establishment of the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee \nheaded  by  the  Financial  Sector  Secretary  and  including  RBI,  NABARD,  and  the  state \ngovernments.  In  addition,  NABARD,  the  implementation  agency,  has  established  the \nDepartment  of  Cooperative  Revitalization  and  Reform  at  its  head  office.  CCS  reform \nimplementation is expected to benefit from the experience of the Government in guiding the \nreform of the commercial banks and RRBs.  \n \n44.  Lessons.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  develop  sustainable  CCS  institutions  is \nconsistent with the lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience, particularly that (i) good governance \nand sustainability are required as the core principles for developing a strong rural finance sector \nfor efficient financial intermediation; (ii) efficient allocation of resources require autonomy in \npricing and client selection; (iii) prolonged dependence on nonmarket-based refinance support \nundermines  sustainability  and  integration  with  the  financial  markets;  and  (iv)  repressive \nagricultural and exchange regime policies, weak extension, and inadequate rural infrastructure \ndepress rural incomes and impair rural finance markets. CCS reform also incorporates the \nlessons from initiatives of other funding agencies in India (Appendix 3) that emphasize (i) in-\ndepth financial and institutional analysis; (ii) upfront commitment to good governance, pricing, \nand discipline; (iii) clearly defined performance benchmarks; (iv) phasing with regard to capacity \nto manage and institutionalize changes; and (v) sequencing to minimize service disruption.  \n \n45.  While not on the same scale, international experience suggests that with stakeholder \ncoordination and commitment, it will be possible to reform India\u2019s CCS. For example, Bank \nRakyat Indonesia (Unit Desas) was restructured into a highly profitable entity from a politicized \nand loss-making credit agency for rice farmers. Other successful restructuring cases include \nBank Pertanian Malaysia and Banco Agricola de la Republica in the Dominican Republic, while \nthe Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives in Thailand extended its coverage to \nmost  rural  households  through  enhanced  operational  practices.  These  included  good \ngovernance, managerial autonomy, staff accountability and incentives, low transaction costs, \nflexible product design and pricing, effective risk management and monitoring, emphasis on \nsavings, diversified portfolios, and advanced information technology. \n    \n46.  ADB Strategy. Inclusive social development is a key strategic priority of ADB and one of \nthe three pillars of ADB operations in India, along with sustainable economic growth and good \ngovernance. In light of this, ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program update33 highlights the \nneed for strengthening the rural finance sector to promote growth and stability of rural incomes \nand employment. In line with the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan and its Midterm Assessment, ADB\u2019s \nstrategy also recognizes that rural infrastructure to support diversification into higher value-\nadded crops, and development of CFMs and agribusinesses to help small farmers diversify risk, \nas  well  as  enhanced  irrigation  infrastructure  throughout  the  country,  are  also  critical  for \naccelerating agricultural growth and rural development. Project interventions are planned in all \nthese areas in ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for 2007\u20132009. \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): India. Manila. \n ", "  15   \n47.  Donor Coordination. The Government of the United Kingdom financed ADB\u2019s TA to \nhelp develop the CCS reform agenda, and is also providing additional grant financing for the TA \nattached to this Program (para. 85). The lead role of ADB in developing the Program has also \nbeen closely coordinated with KfW, in view of its long track record of involvement in rural \nfinance in India and substantial funding to support the reforms. KfW has worked extensively with \nNABARD in developing nonfarm lending programs and is also piloting loan-based approaches \nto watershed development. In addition, the German Technical Cooperation Agency has helped \nNABARD develop an implementation planning and monitoring framework for CCS reform.  \n \n48.  Since early 2006, the Government has proactively sought support for CCS reform from \nexternal funding agencies. The CCS reform agenda has been reviewed by ADB and the World \nBank  to  coordinate  their  approaches  in  providing  financial  support  for  the  reforms.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund has endorsed the enhanced regulation and supervision of the \nCCS, while cautioning Government to proceed carefully on reform implementation to preserve \npublic confidence in the financial system. ADB has also shared its work on CCS reform with the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), and is closely coordinating its proposed interventions in CFMs and \nagribusiness with the latter.34 In regard to CFMs, USAID is focusing on legal and institutional \nstrengthening  of  CFM  regulation,  surveillance  and  enforcement,  and  the  development  of \ninstitutional infrastructure to improve market efficiency. On the agricultural side, USAID has \nstarted several initiatives to test how marketing chains in agriculture can be improved and \nfostered  partnerships  between  US  land  grant  universities  and  Indian  state  agricultural \nuniversities  to  improve  agribusiness  and  marketing  capacity.  Rabobank  and  the  Rabo \nDevelopment Program of the Netherlands are also considering substantial support for CCS \nreforms, and ADB has shared its work on CCS reform with them.  \n \n49.  Funding agencies either already processing their support for CCS reform or actively \nconsidering such support have the advantage of leveraging ADB and KfW\u2019s work in designing \ntheir interventions. In addition, the components of grant TA attached to the Program (paras. 85\u2013\n86) provided by the Government of the United Kingdom could be replicated and expanded by \nother funding agencies. The Program also incorporates mechanisms to ensure broad-based \nstakeholder consultations. In order to avoid overlaps, ADB and KfW assistance will focus on \nselected states.   \n \nIV.   THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n   \n50.  The Program has been designed to help the Government\u2019s reform agenda, which was \nformulated with ADB TA (para. 47) to accelerate rural economic growth by addressing the key \nconstraints in rural finance. Good governance and reduced government involvement will be at \nthe core of CCS reform to ensure equitable and improved access for small and marginal \nfarmers to rural finance services. The Program is the outcome of intensive policy dialogue that \nhas been carried out over a period of 3 years and was closely coordinated with stakeholders, \nincluding NABARD, selected state governments, the Task Force, other development partners, \nand NGOs.35 The Program\u2019s main features are described in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 5. \n                                                 \n34 ADB is providing TA (Strengthening Commodity Markets, component TA under TA 4814-IND: [ADB. 2006. \nTechnical Assistance to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila]) to build capacity of \nsector institutions, which is expected to provide the basis for an ensuing ADB loan project in 2007 aimed at \ndeveloping commodity market infrastructure. This TA is financed by the Government of the United Kingdom through \nthe Department for International Development. \n35 Chronology of processing is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n ", "16  \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n51.  The goal of the Program is to develop a sustainable CCS and the objective is to help the \nGovernment carry out its CCS reform agenda. Its impact is enhanced income and employment \ngrowth for the rural poor, while its purpose is to improve rural households\u2019 access to affordable \nfinancial services through an efficient CCS. The scope is comprehensive CCS reform in five \nstates\u2014from among Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and \nOrissa\u2014that have concurred with the reform agenda.36 A profile of these states, including the \nstatus of the CCS, is discussed in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix D. The first five of \nthese states have 5 SCBs, 136 DCCBs, and 43,227 PACSs with about 41 million members.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions  \n52.  The Program has three components: (i) establishing a policy reform and implementation \nframework;  (ii)  building  a  facilitating  legal,  regulatory,  and  governance  framework;  and  (iii) \ninstitutional reforms for sustainability.  \n \n1.  Establishing a Policy Reform and Implementation Framework \n \n53.  As the CCS was established and supported by the Government, its present impaired \ncondition is also the result of government interference. This requires policy reforms and an \nimplementation framework where the states withdraw from operating the CCS while improving \nits operating environment, including through transparent and upfront provision of any interest \nrate subsidies or debt forgiveness through the budget. Specifically, under the Program: \n  \n(i)  The Task Force reviews the performance of the CCS and develops a nationwide \nreform  package  for  the  CCS,  including  the  SCBs,  DCCBs,  and  PACSs \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n(ii)  Consensus  is  reached  on  CCS  reform  between  Government  and  state \ngovernments based on the recommendations of the Task Force. \n \n(iii)  The  Government  communicates  the  CCS  reform  framework  to  the  state \ngovernments, including financing and implementation arrangements. \n  \n(iv)  At least five states, hereinafter referred as participating states (PS), sign MOUs \nwith the Government and NABARD accepting the CCS reform package, including \ncommitment to share the costs and to ensure full autonomy for CCS in financial \nand internal administrative matters. \n  \n(v)  The Government and PSs make budgetary provisions to support CCS reform. \n \n(vi)  A National Implementation and Monitoring Committee is constituted to oversee \nthe reform process. \n \n(vii)  NABARD establishes the Department of Cooperative Revitalization and Reform \nat its head office to support CCS reform. \n  \n                                                 \n36 Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan have signed the MOUs. The Government in \nconsultation with ADB will indicate the fifth PS to be covered under the Program by March 2007 from among the \nremaining two states (Gujarat and Orissa). While the main text of this document uses Gujarat data for aggregate \npurposes, discussion of the CCS in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix D refer to all the six states.  \n ", "  17   \n(viii)  The PSs establish state-level implementation committees (SLIC) and district-\nlevel implementation committees (DLIC). \n  \n(ix)  NABARD  constitutes  state  task  forces  in  the  PSs  to  periodically  review \nperformance  of  the  CCS\u2014including  good  governance,  and  compliance  with \nstatutory requirements\u2014and suggest improvements. \n \n(x)  The Government convenes stakeholder consultations to obtain feedback on the \nassessment of CCS reform by an independent agency and, as required, provides \nfor appropriate measures.  \n \n54.  Of the above, items (i)\u2013(vii) have largely been completed as prior actions and set a \nstrong foundation for implementation of the Program components described below. \n \n2.  Building a Facilitating Legal, Regulatory, and Governance Framework  \n \n    a.  Establishing a Conducive Legal Framework for CCS  \n \n55.  To ensure autonomy and revive the self-help characteristics of the CCS, the Task Force \nhas  recommended  amendments  to  the  CSAs  with  overriding  provisions  to  ensure  the \nimplementation of its recommendations and convincingly set the basis for a paradigm shift in CCS \noperations. This will also harmonize the CSAs with the MACSAs. Under the Program:  \n \n(i)  The PSs amend the CSAs, initially through interim measures so that the legal \nchanges can take effect immediately, and eventually through amended CSAs. \nThe list of requirements is attached to the development policy letter (Appendix 4). \n   \n(ii)  The  PSs  issue  implementing  rules  and  regulations  corresponding  to  the \namended CSAs and put them into practice. \n \n(iii)  The Government assesses the need to amend the NABARD Act 1982 and the \nDeposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Act 1961 and, if \nrequired, amends these statutes. \n \nb.  Establishing Effective Regulation \n \n56.  Effective regulation of the CCS requires removing the regulatory ambiguity and ensuring \nthat all SCBs, DCCBs, and PACSs taking nonmember deposits are fully subject to prudential \nnorms set by the RBI, and that PACSs transacting business only with members are supervised \nby the registrar of cooperatives based on prudential norms agreed by NABARD. Under the \nProgram:  \n \n(i)  The  Government  amends  the  Banking  Regulation  Act  of  1949  to  introduce \nregulations at par with commercial banks for all CCS entities classified as banks \nand other provisions as attached to the development policy letter (Appendix 4). \n \n(ii)  Enhanced prudential norms for SCBs and DCCBs and guidelines on eligibility for \nboards of directors and chief executive officers of SCBs and DCCBs are issued. \n \n(iii)  The PSs issue prudential norms for all nonbank CCS institutions (especially \nPACSs) in consultation with NABARD and report on their implementation. \n \n ", "18  \n(iv)  Supervision  and  regulation  of  CCS  undertaken  in  PSs  in  accordance  with \namended CSAs and prudential norms for PACSs are applied. \n \nc.  Enhancing Good Governance  \n \n57.  In most states, elections to CCS boards have been irregular and significantly delayed, \neven for decades. The resulting politicization and poor governance has eroded the ability of the \nCCS to meet the demands of its members. By reintroducing regular elections, the democratic \ncharacter of the CCS will be restored and reinforced by a governance framework that separates \nownership from management and seeks accountability. To enhance good governance, the \nProgram will ensure the following:  \n \n(i)  The PSs prepare plans and hold elections for the CCS where the terms of boards \nand  other  office  bearers  have  expired,  and  conduct  elections  to  install  new \ndirectors and other office bearers. \n(ii)  The PSs reduce their equity to a maximum of 25% at all tiers of the CCS and \nconvert the amount in excess of 25% to grants to the CCS. \n(iii)  The PSs withdraw state government nominees on the boards of PACSs. \n  \n(iv)  The PSs limit participation in SCBs and DCCBs to one nominee on the board. \n \n(v)  The PSs identify and remove board of directors at SCBs and DCCBs not meeting \nthe approved criteria for such positions. \n \n(vi)  NABARD issues a policy of annual audits of SCBs and DCCBs by independent \nchartered accountants commencing FY2007. \n  \n(vii)  NABARD issues guidelines for independent rating of SCBs and DCCBs. Two \nsuch ratings are conducted during the Program period.  \n(viii)  SCBs and DCCBs terminate the tenure of directors on their boards representing \nPACSs that have defaulted in their obligations to DCCBs.  \n \n3.  Institutional Reforms for Sustainability \n \n58.  Policy, legal, and regulatory reforms alone are not sufficient to transform the CCS. The \ncentury-old CCS has mostly operated under a paradigm that has repressed viable financial \nintermediation. A lack of viability imperatives under weak governance led to high overheads and \ninefficiencies. While these seemed intractable in the past, within the context of the ongoing \nfinancial  sector  reforms,  it  is  possible  to  restructure  the  CCS  by  fundamentally  altering \ngovernance and operational norms. The social capital and sunk costs of the widespread CCS \nnetwork, often in places without banks, could be put to more efficient use through institutional \nreforms within the context of action plans for revival/development action plans for PACSs, \nDCCBs,  and  SCBs  with  sequenced  organizational,  institutional,  and  financial  restructuring \nmeasures. As the building blocks of the CCS, initial priority will be accorded to restructuring \nPACSs. Under the Program: \n  \n(i)  NABARD develops and implements (a) accounting standards; (b) management \ninformation  systems,  including  internal  control  and  audit  systems;  (c) \ncomputerization plans; and (d) human resource development plans.  \n ", "  19   \n \n(ii)  NABARD develops guidelines linking refinance to CCS reform implementation. \n \n(iii)  NABARD  considers  refinance  to  the  CCS  either  directly  or  through  other \nregulated financial institutions at terms set by its Board. \n \n(iv)  NABARD develops formats and guidelines for special audits of PACSs to assess \nthe extent of accumulated losses as on 31 March 2004 and conducts sample \naudits.  \n \n(v)  NABARD develops model action plans for revival/development action plans for \nPACSs, DCCBs, and SCBs, including financial and operational benchmarks. \n \n(vi)  Special audits of PACSs, DCCBs and SCBs are conducted to assess the extent \nof accumulated losses as on 31 March 2004, factoring in the results of the \nrespective lower tiers. \n \n(vii)  DCCBs and PACSs sign agreements with DLICs, and SCBs sign agreements \nwith SLICs to implement CCS reform. \n \n(viii)  PACSs,  DCCBs,  and  SCBs  adopt  and  implement  action  plans  for \nrevival/development action plans. \n  \n(ix)  The PSs discontinue further placement of cadre-based secretaries in PACSs, \nand develop and implement a plan for phasing out such posts. \n \n(x)  NABARD provides financial support for cleaning accumulated losses37 of SCBs, \nDCCBs, and eligible PACSs in PSs that meet the benchmark requirements of the \nMOU. \n \n(xi)  The PSs develop and implement action plans for ineligible PACSs.  \n \n59.  To qualify for financial support and ensure that major actions are taken upfront, the PSs \nwill complete the following for the first release of financial assistance from the Government: (i) \nspecial audits, (ii) CCS institutions sign agreements with SLICs and DLICs, (iii) measures to put \nthe proposed amendments to the CSAs into effect, and (iv) release of their proportionate share \nof the reform costs. The second release of financial assistance will be subject to (i) the CSAs \nbeing amended, (ii) conduct of elections wherever due, and (iii) appointment of professional \nboards and chief operating officers.  \n \n60.  Assessments indicate that much of the problems in the CCS result directly from political \ninterference. Therefore, the envisaged changes in the operating environment provide a much \nbetter chance of revival than the current financial performance may suggest. Within this context, \nthe financial assistance for cleaning accumulated losses as on 31 March 2004 for PACSs with \nrepayment levels of 50% and above will be provided subject to completion of upfront actions by \nthe respective PSs. PACSs with repayment levels between 30% to 50% will receive assistance \n                                                 \n37  These include losses due to (i) nonrepayment of loans for agricultural and other purposes such as consumer goods \nand housing; (ii) losses on account of noncredit businesses such as the public distribution system, procurement of \nfood grains on behalf of government, and sale of fertilizers; (iii) nonrepayment of loans under government \nguarantees where state governments have not paid invoked guarantees to the CCS; and (iv) nonrepayment of \ndues from governments due to waivers or subsidies announced by them and losses from fraud.  \n ", "20  \nin three annual back-ended installments subject to their achieving an incremental increase in \nthe collection of dues and the respective PSs meeting the requirements outlined in the previous \nparagraph. Performance targets outlined in the action plans for revival/development action plans \nwill be monitored. \n \nC.  Important Features  \n \n61.  The Government\u2019s intention to pursue a substantive CCS reform program allows ADB to \nparticipate  in  a  high-priority  development  intervention.  The  request  for  ADB  support  is  in \nrecognition of its involvement in developing the initial CCS reform framework for two states and \nalso in backstopping the work of the Task Force.  \n \n62.  Inclusive and Sustainable Growth. Inclusive overall economic growth is the single \nmost powerful mechanism to generate sustainable rural development and reduce poverty. In the \ncontext of national policies (para. 6) aimed at achieving this objective, the Program provides \ncritical support for minimizing the rural\u2013urban divide by systematically empowering the rural \npopulation at the community level with opportunities to meaningfully participate in, and benefit \nfrom, economic growth. Broader sharing of the benefits of growth will enhance social stability \nand mitigate farmer distress, and hence, reinforce the sustainability of the development process. \n \n63.  The  Consensus-building  Approach  for  CCS  Reform.  The  consensus-building \napproach adopted by the Task Force and subsequently by the Government in forging the CCS \nreform agenda, has facilitated state governments\u2019 \u201cbuy-in\u201d to the reform process, which had \nbeen elusive in previous reform efforts and enhances the likelihood of success. Consensus \nbuilding has been and will remain the most critical factor for the successful implementation of \nCCS reform. Both the Government and the state governments have so far shown remarkable \nappreciation of the need for CCS reform and accordingly made adjustments in their stated \npositions to move the CCS reform agenda forward. The process has been both intense and \nsubstantive as sociopolitical factors in addition to financial intermediation aspects have to be \nconsidered in view of the widespread farmer distress. While there is consensus on the reform \nagenda, commitment to meet the political and financial costs by state governments will take \ntime. Therefore, it has taken more than 3 years to arrive at a stage where CCS reform could \ncommence in selected states. Ten states have so far concurred in principle. Of these, five states \nare part of the Program. It is expected that most states will eventually adopt the CCS reform \npackage.  \n \n64.  Major Shift in Rural Political Economy. The reform agenda supports a shift in the \npolitical economy of the rural sector by aligning the policies and laws with regard to the CCS. A \nstrengthened CCS will help create fiscal space for the state governments to undertake much \nneeded investments in rural development over the medium term. \n \n65.  Phasing  Out  the  Role  of  State  Governments.  Phasing  out  the  entrenched  and \nintrusive state interventions in the CCS will restore the balance in favor of its membership. The \nGovernment and state governments will provide the resources to defray the cumulative costs of \ntheir inappropriate interventions and facilitate the transfer of operational control of the CCS to its \nmembers through an enhanced legal, governance, and supervisory framework that is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy.  \n \n66.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy. The program design integrates the key elements of \nADB\u2019s strategies for poverty reduction, rural development, and microfinance development as \n ", "  21   \nwell as its rural finance market analysis.38 The Government\u2019s emphasis on reform of CFMs, risk \nmitigation, and secured transactions39 are consistent with ADB\u2019s operational strategy for India. \nConsidering the evolutionary nature of the reforms, the Program is designed to incorporate \nlessons learned from international and local interventions in the sector. \n \n67.  Maximizing  Long-term  Impacts  through  Good  Governance.  The  Program \nfundamentally alters the norms for CCS governance and operations. By shifting emphasis to \nsystemic issues affecting the CCS, and by directly addressing the issue of poor governance in \nthe CCS, the Program facilitates a level playing field in rural economic relations.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan  \n \n68.  It is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $1.0 billion equivalent from its ordinary capital \nresources, with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate-based lending facility, \nincluding a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the Loan Agreement. The Program will be cofinanced by KfW, which has committed \n\u20ac140 million in a parallel financing arrangement (Supplementary Appendix E). KfW\u2019s financial \nsupport will also target CCS reform in the PSs covered under the Program and its phasing will \nbe synchronized with that of ADB. Given the close coordination with KfW in program preparation \nover 3 years, this cofinancing arrangement is important for ADB to expand its relationship with a \nkey development partner in a critical operational area. \n \n69.  CCS  reform  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing  issues  and  socially \nsignificant measures to enhance credit outreach to the small and marginal farmers. To expedite \nand mainstream CCS reform in the PSs, the loan amount and magnitude of KfW\u2019s financial \nsupport were determined on the basis of the estimated adjustment costs of $1.43 billion.40 \nAdjustment costs will be triggered by policy, legal, and institutional reforms. The PSs account for \na large portion (nearly half) of the overall adjustment costs of $3.02 billion. While the cost of \nreform is expected to exceed these estimates, there is also a possibility that the fiscal situation \nof some PSs may improve significantly during the Program period. In this event, it is possible \nthat such PSs may seek to fund a greater proportion of their share of the cost of reform from out \ntheir own resources. This will be monitored during implementation.41   \n \n70.  The Government is seeking to mobilize significant financial resources upfront to ensure \nthat financing is adequate to support early adopters as they move ahead with the reforms, given \nthe important demonstration effect it would have in encouraging other states to join the reform \nprocess (para. 43). In terms of other financing partners, the World Bank has indicated that it \nplans to provide an initial loan of $500 million in 2007 that could be topped by a similar amount. \nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation may consider support during its next fiscal year \n                                                 \n38 ADB. 2000.

Considering the \npoor quality of information especially at the PACSs level, the actual cost of cleaning the accumulated losses will be \nknown after the special audits.  \n41 The fiscal status of PSs is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n ", "22  \nbased on experience of Program implementation. In addition, Rabobank has informed that it is \nalso considering a $600 million package to support CCS reform.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Program Management and Implementation \n71.  The implementation mechanisms have been designed on a modular basis (Appendix 7), \nin line with the structure of the reform process that stipulates uniform reform content in each PS \nwithin the overall policy framework. The Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the \nexecuting department for the Program and NABARD will be the implementing agency. The \nDepartment of Cooperative Revival and Reform at NABARD\u2019s head office will serve as the \nprogram management unit.  \n \n72.  The Ministry of Finance will release ADB and KfW loan funds to NABARD and will take \noverall responsibility for program financial management and reporting. NABARD, in turn, will \noversee day-to-day implementation of the Program. It will channel funds to the CCS for cleaning \nthe accumulated losses based on the achievement of reform benchmarks. In addition, it will \nboth manage and incur all other expenses relating to Program actions.  \n \n73.  High-level  coordination  of  the  reform  effort  will  be  provided  by  the  National \nImplementation and Monitoring Committee, which will be the Program\u2019s steering committee. The \nSLICs to be established in the PSs will serve as state level steering committees. The SLICs will \ncoordinate the efforts of the DLICs. NABARD\u2019s regional and district offices will provide technical \nand financial support to the SLICs and DLICs. In the PSs, the SLICs and DLICs will sign \ninstitution-specific agreements with the three tiers of the CCS and have the important role of \nenforcing  the  conditions  associated  with  financial  restructuring  and  release  of  financial \nassistance, as well as tracking the progress of state-level reforms.  \n \n74.  Efficient management of CCS reform is crucial to avoid disruption of service delivery \nwhile reducing rural poverty and farmer distress. NABARD\u2019s experience in facilitating nationwide \nreform of RRBs will be a critical success factor for effective implementation of CCS reform. \nNABARD has a national presence and well-regarded training institutions for agriculture banking \nand  rural  development.  NABARD\u2019s  network  of  nearly  220  district  offices  will  be  used  to \ncoordinate CCS reform. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n \n75.  The Program will be implemented during 2006\u20132010. The Government intends to fulfill \nall tranche-release conditions within a 3-year period (Appendix 8).  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n76.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the \nGovernment as the Borrower. The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced in, and procured \nfrom,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources and from countries \nthat are not ADB members. The Government will certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible \nimports is equal to or exceeds ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given \n ", "  23   \nperiod; and (ii) the policy loan proceeds will be used as agreed in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \nThe policy loan proceeds will be disbursed based on certification provided by the Government, \nwhich confirms that the above loan requirements have been met. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds  \n \n77.  The Government and ADB will monitor the use of counterpart funds for meeting the \nadjustment costs associated with CCS reform.  \n \n5.  Tranching and Monitoring \n \n78.  Monitorable and time-bound actions for tranche release are indicated in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 4). The proposed loan will be released in four tranches over a 3 year period. The first \ntranche of $250 million will be released upon loan effectiveness and compliance with the first \ntranche release conditions, the second tranche of $250 million will be released within 12 months \nof the first tranche, the third tranche of $300 million will be released within 12 months of the \nsecond tranche, and the fourth tranche of $200 million will be released within 12 months of the \nthird tranche subject to compliance with the conditions for their release. KfW\u2019s assistance will be \nsynchronized  with  ADB.  Based  on  the  requisite  Government  approvals,  the  first  KfW \ndisbursement (indicative amount \u20ac65 million) is expected in mid-2007 and will be based on \nKfW\u2019s assessment of progress of Program implementation. Subsequent tranche releases will be \nin  tandem  with  ADB.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  KfW  will  regularly  and  closely  monitor \nProgram implementation, and an independent agency, to be engaged under the grant TA \n(paras. 85\u201386), will assess reform implementation. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n79.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB and \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby the Government for each withdrawal application. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at RBI to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be established, \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The Banking \nDivision will send semi-annual reports to ADB status of program actions. The Banking Division, \nthrough NABARD, will maintain separate records and accounts on the use of counterpart funds \nfollowing sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts and records audited annually \nby auditors acceptable to ADB, and will furnish, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, \ncertified copies of the audit report together with the auditor\u2019s opinion to the Government and ADB.   \n \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n80.   The Government will keep ADB and KfW informed of the progress of CCS reform. A \nprogram performance monitoring system (PPMS) will be established to track reform progress. A \nbiannual report generated by the PPMS will be submitted by NABARD to the Government and \nADB within 2 months of end of each half year. The PPMS will track implementation of the policy \nmatrix (Appendix 4) in the PSs including the (i) status and implementation of policies; (ii) \nprogress on the legislative amendments; (iii) status of governance reforms, especially in terms \nof autonomy and reduced state control; and (iv) institutional strengthening for sustainability of \neach tier of the CCS. In addition, the report will note progress in achieving the indicators set out \nin the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 5) and include appendices documenting \ntranche release compliance. \n ", "24  \n81.  The financial and operational information for SCBs and DCCBs will be tracked for (i) \ncapital  adequacy;  (ii)  aggregated  financial  indicators  covering  savings,  loan  portfolio,  and \nrepayment  performance;  and  (iii)  efficiency  indicators  such  as    per  staff  business  and \ntransaction costs.  Data  for  PACSs  will  include  capital  adequacy,  repayment  rate,  member \nsavings, loan portfolio, and outreach (small and marginal farmers and women). The respective \nDCCBs will help collate data relating to PACSs.42 In addition, until PACSs are computerized, \nsamples will be selected to provide the basis for performance assessment.  \n \n  8.  Governance and Anticorruption  \n \n82.  The Program directly addresses the weak governance in the CCS by (i) phasing out \nstate  government\u2019s  role,  (ii)  establishing  a  legal  framework  that  ensures  autonomy,  (iii) \nreintroducing regular elections and restoring their democratic character, (iv) instituting effective \nregulation and streamlining of regulatory processes, and (v) implementing institutional reforms. \nCCS reform reduces the vulnerability to corruption by ensuring (i) corporate governance is \nenhanced  in  the  CCS  by  the  PSs,  (ii)  compliance  with  transparency  and  disclosure \nrequirements, and (iii) adequate monitoring mechanisms are in place (Appendix 10).  \n \n83.  In addition, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. In this context, a \nfinancial management assessment was also undertaken by NABARD (Supplementary Appendix \nG) to provide assurance that ADB loan funds will be used for their intended purpose. ADB will \nregularly review the financial reports of the audit authorities to assess any potential financial and \nadministrative irregularities. During regular review missions, the financial management, and \ngovernance and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure that their provisions \nremain valid and are helping the reforms to succeed. \n \n9.  Program Review \n \n84.  ADB, KfW, and the Government will review program implementation semi-annually. The \nreviews will include evaluation of the program scope, implementation, progress, reform agenda, \ncapacity-building,  disbursements  to  end  beneficiaries,  governance,  anticorruption  risk \nassessments,  and  related  matters.  ADB  will  also  field  regular  review  missions,  including \nmidterm review and program completion missions. Based on the midterm review, modifications \nand improvements  will be considered in  achieving the overall objectives  of the  Program.  A \nprogram completion report will be provided by the Government within 3 months of program \ncompletion.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n85.  A TA grant from the Government of the United Kingdom through the Department for \nInternational Development in the amount of $2.0 million is attached to the Program. The goal of \nthe TA titled Capacity Building for Rural Cooperative Credit Structure Reform is to support \nimplementation  of  CCS  reform  under  the  Program  and  its  objective  is  expeditious \n                                                 \n42  The SCBs and DCCBs already have an extensive information bases for statutory and non-statutory compliance. \nHowever, data with regard to PACSs lack authenticity and are inordinately delayed to serve any meaningful \npurpose.  Cognizant  of  this  systemic  inadequacy,  the  Program  supports  strengthening  of  the  management \ninformation system.  \n \n ", "  25   \ncommencement of CCS reform. The purpose of the TA is to strengthen implementation and \nmonitoring of CCS reform and enhance its social and gender impacts. The TA will consist of the \nfollowing components: \n \n(i)  Program Performance Monitoring System. The TA will facilitate the setting up \nand implementation of the PPMS as described in paras. 80\u201381.  \n \n(ii)  Capacity Building of State-level Institutions. The TA will (i) develop guidelines \non  CCS  reform  implementation  for  SLICs  and  DLICs,  (ii)  hold  statewise \nworkshops on the guidelines, and (iii) organize seminars for SLICs and DLICs on \nexperience sharing and lessons learned.  \n \n(iii)  Outreach to Poor Rural Women. The TA will work collaboratively with NABARD \nto pilot test innovative approaches to assist diversification of income-earning \nopportunities and enhance credit outreach to poor rural women in the context of \nCCS  reform.  Baseline  indicators  will  be  developed  and  an  initial  survey \nconducted  to  provide  a  basis  to  assess  the socioeconomic  impacts of  CCS \nreform.  \n \n(iv)  Assessment of CCS Reform Implementation. CCS reform implementation will \nbe assessed during the duration of the Program by an independent agency to be \nrecruited under the TA. The independent agency in arriving at its conclusion will \ndraw on the PPMS and also collect documentary evidence of reform compliance \nas required by ADB and KfW. The assessment reports will be submitted no later \nthan 3 weeks prior to the anticipated date of tranche release and will cover (i) \nstatus and implementation of policies constituting the operating environment of \nthe CCS; (ii) progress on the legislative amendments; (iii) status of governance \nreforms, especially in terms of autonomy and reduced state controls; and (iv) \ninstitutional strengthening for sustainability of each tier of the CCS. \n \n86.  The Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing department for the \nTA  and  NABARD  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  Banking  Division  will  form  a  TA \nimplementation committee comprising of two senior officers each from the Banking Division and \nNABARD. ADB will engage TA consultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (April 2006) as amended from time to time. The quality- and cost-\nbased selection and simplified technical proposal methods will be used. The scale of consultant \ninputs, terms of reference, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements are described in \nSupplementary Appendix H. The implementation of the TA will also be closely coordinated with \n(i) the consultants engaged by KfW as part of their proposed TA; (ii) the ongoing work by \nGerman Technical Cooperation Agency to develop a detailed implementation planning and \nmonitoring framework for CCS reform; and (iii) the assistance from other funding agencies that \nare actively considering support for CCS reform.  \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n87.  Because the problems in the CCS impose significant social and economic costs, the \nbenefits of reform could be large. Enhanced access by rural households to affordable financial \nservices and related improvement in growth and employment in rural areas could potentially \nbenefit  nearly  41  million  members  of  the  CCS  in  the  PSs.  The  overall  impact  becomes \n ", "26  \nsignificantly  larger  if  the  estimated  160  million  members  of  their  households  are  included. \nHowever, in view of the multitude of deep-seated problems, institutional change and thus the \nbenefits of reform are expected to materialize only gradually. \n \n1.  Policy  \n \n88.  Financial institutions can respond to growth opportunities only when they operate in a \nfavorable policy environment and are commercially oriented, appropriately governed, organized, \nand equipped. Program supported reforms will provide this critical linkage.  \n \n(i)  Harmonization of the policy and legal framework between Government and state \ngovernments  with  regard  to  the  CCS  will  create  an  environment  that  will \nstrengthen the rural finance sector. \n  \n(ii)  Phasing out the state government\u2019s role will restore the autonomy of the CCS as \nmember-owned and -managed financial intermediaries. \n  \n(iii)  At the supervisory and regulatory levels, the new norms and incentives set for \nthe CCS will facilitate development of sustainable rural finance markets. \n  \n(iv)  Extending the core values of good governance and transparency will strengthen \nthe integration of the CCS with the mainstream financial sector. \n  \n(v)  A viable CCS will not only intermediate its own savings, but also raise resources \nfrom money markets and help reduce outflow of rural savings. \n \n(vi)  Gradual broadening and deepening of services offered by the CCS will respond \nto the heterogeneous demand profile, growing significance of the rural nonfarm \nsector, and immense savings potential of rural areas.  \n \n(vii)  CCS  reform  will  strengthen  the  synergy  between  the  CCS  institutions,  risk \nmitigation strategies, and CFM initiatives. \n  \n(viii)  CCS reform will create broad-based support to sustain policies for economic \ngrowth, including further reform in the rural finance sector once the CCS is able \nto institutionalize the reforms supported by the Program. \n \n2.   Institutional  \n \n89.  Undertaking institutional reform, rationalization, amalgamation, and closures premised \non  cost-effectiveness  and  probability  of  success  will  provide  the  incentives  for  addressing \ninstitutional  weaknesses  for  moving  on  the  continuum  of  sustainable  intermediation.  The \nrestructuring gains will be captured in improved governance, cost savings, and lower transaction \ncosts. Since the reforms are being undertaken in the context of a supportive policy and legal \nframework, they have a reasonable chance of success. Prior commitment to the reform agenda, \nincluding the acceptance of attrition of some entities, will facilitate institutional transformation.  \n \n90.  While  ensuring  prudent  lending  and  investment  decisions  through  effective  formal \nregulation  of  SCBs  and  DCCBs,  the  Program  will  help  harmonize  and  strengthen  CCS \nregulation. In addition, nonprudential oversight of the vast network of PACSs will enhance the \nconfidence of the members, borrowers, and lenders in the PACSs. However, the PACSs and \nDCCBs  will  only  turnaround  gradually  as  a  result  of  financial  restructuring  and  improved \nrepayment rates, cost reductions caused by rationalization of systems and procedures, and \n ", "  27   \nefficiency  gains  through  enhanced  management  information  systems.  The  gradual \ndepoliticization of debt recovery will also improve portfolio quality over time, which will prompt \ncommercial  banks  to  increase  their  rural  finance  loan  portfolios,  thus  reinforcing  improved \noutreach of rural finance services.  \n \n3.  Social and Poverty \n \n91.  At the macro level, the Program supports the poverty reduction goal through greater \naccess  to  affordable  rural  finance  services,  which  in  turn  will  facilitate  better  access  to \nproductive  resources  (e.g.,  farm  inputs,  improved  technologies,  and  rural  infrastructure). \nAccessibility will reduce the debt servicing cost paid by small and marginal farmers to the \ninformal sector, which is often higher than their earning capacity and results in indebtedness. \nThe CCS will not only be able to effectively target the lower segment of the rural finance market, \nbut also increase the overall number of borrowers. While it is difficult to project the volume of \nbusiness beyond the normal growth trends of the CCS in the PSs, the number of members that \nwould be able to access credit would expand significantly with the increased retail capacity of \nthe CCS. \n \n92.  CCS reform will increase household incomes through (i) higher returns from farming; (ii) \nincreased employment through diversification and new enterprises, including nonagricultural \nactivities or expansion of existing ones; (iii) higher responsiveness to emerging rural nonfarm \nenterprise  opportunities;  (iv)  a  shift  from  irregular,  low-paid  daily  labor  to  more  diversified \nsources of employment; and (v) increased accumulation of financial assets and, therefore, \nimproved risk management. Increased employment will come from the high labor content of \ncommercial crops, increased cropping intensities, and increased value addition.  \n \n93.  Anchored in an overall strategy of inclusive growth, the most significant benefit of CCS \nreform is start of a shift in the rural economy by empowering small and marginal farmers to \nmeaningfully and substantially participate in, and benefit from, development. The recognition of \nthe CCS as a central institution for rural transformation provides an opportunity for low-income \nhouseholds to realize significant social capital and equity gains in India\u2019s hierarchical social \ncontext.  Restoring  control  of  the  CCS  to  its  members  and  the  incentives  for  improved \ngovernance, transparency, and operational performance is expected to bring major changes in \nthe rural economic landscape. Development of a conducive policy and legal framework for the \nCCS will also strengthen the role of civil society in the rural sector. \n \n94.  Restructuring the CCS into an effective and efficient rural finance mechanism will have \ndirect and indirect positive social benefits. The transformation of the CCS into genuine member-\nowned and controlled entities implies that internally the CCS will increasingly be driven by the \npriorities  of  its  members.  Individual  CCS  institutions  will  thus  be  more  self-reliant  and \nautonomous,  and  more  capable  of  articulating  local  issues,  mobilizing  local  resources, \nenhancing bargaining power for the local communities, widening options for income-generating \nactivities, and enhancing local control over factors of production without increasing risks for the \npoor. These trends will facilitate integration of the rural poor into the mainstream economy, and \nhelp build defense mechanisms against poverty at household, group, and village levels, which \nwill be particularly important for women. About 20% of the SHGs are promoted, guided, and \nfinanced by banks, and 72% are promoted and guided by the Government and other formal \nagencies, such as DCCBs, and financed by banks (further details are in Appendix 11). The \nremaining 8% are promoted by NGOs and financed by banks. By reforming the CCS, more \nSHGs and, therefore, more female borrowers will have access to rural finance services.  \n \n ", "28  \n4.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n95.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  reforms  identified  no  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  The  poverty  and  social  assessment \n(Appendix 11) determined that no persons will be negatively affected in terms of ADB\u2019s policies \non involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. The Program is category C in all three areas. \n \nB.   Risks   \n \n96.  CCS  reform  entails  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory,  governance,  and \ninstitutional issues exacerbated by longstanding political interference. At the macro level, the \nconsensus, as well as the progress, on the reform agenda is driven by the growing recognition \nby stakeholders of the significance of improving rural living standards where most people live. \nWhile this is the most effective measure to ensure sustained reform commitment at all levels, \nachieving expected impacts will depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees of risk. Mitigation measures are being put in place where feasible and appropriate. \n \n97.  Reform Commitment. Despite the Government\u2019s successful track record in reforming \nthe commercial banks and RRBs, there are significant risks in dealing with the CCS particularly \nthe  likelihood  that  PSs  may  waver  in  their  commitment  to  reform.  In  addition,  the  reform \nhierarchy  involving  actors  all  the  way  down  to  the  grassroots  level  could  also  slow  the \nmomentum of reforms. These risks are dealt with in part by front loading the conditions relating \nto the policy reform and implementation framework, upfront legal assurances, and phased \nfinancial  assistance.  The  Program  enables  substitution,  within  the  first  6  months  of \nimplementation,  of  a  PS  by  any  other  state  that  shows  higher  commitment  to  and  faster \nprogress in implementing reforms.  \n \n98.  Reform Harmonization. Intensive efforts to harmonize policies that affect the CCS \nunderscore the different paradigms for the CCS held by Government and the PSs. Sustaining \nthis convergence, particularly on the part of PSs, requires clear priorities as well as deft political \nmanagement to balance the urgent need to reform the CCS with the need to maintain social \nstability, especially in resource-poor areas. The Government has stepped in to mitigate the risks \nto the reform process by addressing urgent sociopolitical issues, including a recent package of \nmeasures to ameliorate farmer distress.  \n \n99.  Eligibility Criteria. In a reform of this scale, some attrition is expected. Arriving at a \nconsensus on the reform agenda necessitated the inclusion of entities with a repayment level of \n30% as eligible for support under the Program. While some of these PACSs may not be able to \nturn around, the rationale for including them has been that (i) many of the problems in the CCS \nresult directly from political interference and, therefore, a fundamental shift in the operating \nenvironment provides a much better chance of revival than financial performance may suggest; \nand (ii) the spatial distribution of poorly performing PACSs in some cases is concentrated in \ndefined areas, and as such excluding them would mean winding down the CCS in parts of the \ncountry. Support for this category of PACSs under the Program is phased and contingent upon \nmeeting performance benchmarks. Even factoring in the attrition of some of these PACSs, the \nCCS reform as currently structured would still provide substantial benefits under a conservative \n10% annual growth on disbursements, thus decreasing the risk of reduced access to rural \nfinance services.  \n \n100.  Phasing of Support. The financial support provided for cleaning accumulated losses \neven after completion of the special audits, progress on legal enactments and institutional \n ", "  29   \nreforms poses a moral hazard risk that PSs and recipient CCS institutions will not follow through \non the subsequent reform and institutional restructuring commitments or may even renege on \nprevious reforms. To mitigate this risk, the PSs will contribute financially to CCS reform upfront, \nand thus have an interest in seeing the process move forward. The CCS reform cleans the \naccumulated  losses  only  up  to  FY2004.  The  CCS  institutions,  thereafter,  are  expected  to \nimprove performance including collection of past dues while operating under an enhanced \nprudential regime. Defining the reform program as a one-time measure mitigates the moral \nhazard of perpetually supporting weak institutions. In addition, other mitigation measures are \nbeing considered, including linking the availability of NABARD refinance to CCS reform.  \n \n101.  Institutional  Reforms.  Staff  behavior  could  prove  resistant  to  governance  and \ninstitutional reforms, thereby undermining the expected improvements in performance. Factors \nthat  mitigate  these  risks  include  (i)  upfront  commitment  on  the  governance  framework, \nautonomy, and professionalization of boards; (ii) redefining the institutional mission and vision; \n(iii) reducing cost overheads; and (iv) significant investments in systems and procedures (e.g., \naccounting and management information systems), and human resource development. The \nneed and significance of reforms are being widely publicized. \n \n102.  Implementation.  Implementation  risk  will  be  minimized  through  engagement  of  an \nindependent  agency  to  assess  reform  implementation.  NABARD  will  provide  the  skills  to \nimplement CCS reform effectively and monitor CCS performance as well as support SLICs and \nDLICs.  NABARD  has  a  nationwide  presence  and  operates  an  extensive  data  collection \nmechanism for the CCS. The TA attached to the Program will further supplement NABARD \nefforts. In addition, KfW is expected to provide substantial TA for implementation support and \ncapacity building. These efforts will be further coordinated with other external support for CCS \nreform. ADB and KfW financial assistance will be released in four tranches, which provides \nconsiderable scope for dialogue with the Government, allows more time for the Government to \naddress any implementation issues, and helps increase stakeholder ownership.  \n \n103.  Complementary Reforms. The complementary reforms (para. 6) may not progress fast \nenough to complement CCS reform. This risk, however, is not considered to be significant given \nthe political imperative for the Government to improve rural conditions and the overarching \nemphasis on the rural sector in government development programs. Important initiatives in \nCFMs and agribusiness have also been programmed by ADB and other funding agencies that \nwill help advance the complementary reform agenda. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES  \n \n104.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will and will cause NABARD, and the PSs to: (a) maintain the \npolicies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement for the \nProgram, as described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, for \nthe duration of the Program and subsequently; (b) promptly adopt and implement \nthe policies and take the actions included in the Program as specified in the \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of the Program and subsequently.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that (a) the counterpart funds will be used for the \ncosts associated with CCS reform under the Program and shall, in particular, \n ", "30  \ntransfer  the  counterpart  funds  generated  under  the  Loan,  through  NABARD \nunder normal arrangements for transferring external assistance to the PSs and \nshall treat such counterpart funds as an additionality to its transfers allocated to \nthe PSs; and (b) all PSs make available on a timely basis, the counterpart funds \nrequired for the Program through timely budget appropriations/ allocations and in \naccordance with relevant MOUs and/or agreements. \n \n(iii)  The Government and the PSs will ensure that the reforms under the Program, \nincluding  institutional,  legal  and  financial  reforms,  and  respective \nMOUs/agreements between various agencies under the CCS reform package \nare formulated, finalized, and implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \n(iv)  As part of the legal and institutional reforms and compliance of various tranche \nreleases,  the  Government  will  ensure  and  cause  the  PSs  to  undertake  the \nnecessary amendments referred to in the development policy letter and ensure \ntheir implementation in an effective and timely manner. \n \n(v)  Towards timely compliance with the activities listed in the development policy \nletter and the policy matrix, the Government will and will cause NABARD, and the \nPSs under the Program to adhere to the implementation schedule to ensure that \ntranches are released in accordance with the policy matrix.  \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that CCS will have autonomy in all financial and \ninternal administrative matters as outlined in the MOUs/respective agreements. \n \n(vii)  In case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity \nand liquidity of the CCS, ADB will be consulted immediately and a remedial \naction plan acceptable to ADB prepared. \n \n(viii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of modifications if any in the CCS \nreform package in so far as these may impact the Program in any manner. \n \n(ix)  The Government and NABARD will regularly exchange views and information \nwith ADB and KfW on any problems and constraints encountered during Program \nimplementation to address any changes and to overcome or mitigate these. \n \n(x)  The Government will ensure that all activities, documents, and enactments under \nthe Program are undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders and their \nfeedback incorporated as appropriate in finalizations; through proper institutional \nmechanisms in place for communication and feedback on all relevant policy \nactions from stakeholders. \n \n(xi)  The Government will take all steps necessary to ensure that relevant enactments \nincluding amendments to existing laws under the agreements reached with the \nGovernment are (a) undertaken with full stakeholder participation and views thus \nprovided  are  incorporated  as  appropriate;  (b)  tabled  in  the  Parliament/State \nlegislatures, respectively, for consideration and enactment well in time and in \nsync with related tranche release requirements, and (c) brought into force, and \nimplemented effectively. \n \n ", "  31   \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n105.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $1,000,000,000 to India for the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring \nand Development Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$2,000,000,  to  the  Government  of  India  for  the  Capacity  Building  for  Rural \nCooperative Credit Structure Reform, to be  provided by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom on a grant basis.  \n  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n17 November 2006 \n \n ", "32  Appendix 1 \nTHE FORMAL RURAL FINANCE SECTOR \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  In a predominantly rural economy in terms of the proportion of people dependent on it, the \nformal  rural  finance  sector  evolved  with  a  marked  supply  side  emphasis.  This  paradigm \ncontributed to the wide institutional network, rural deposit mobilization, and credit expansion. \nHowever, the rural finance sector designed in pursuit of and operated under this paradigm was \ninevitably nonviable. Weak governance exacerbated these problems.  \n \nB.   Formal Banking and Credit \n2.  The  institutional  structure  for  rural  finance  comprises  sets  of  institutions  operating  at \nvarious levels. At the policy level, the Government of India (the Government), state governments, \nand  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI),  the  central  bank,  exercise  their  authority  in  defining  and \nimplementing public policy for rural credit and various laws that govern the formal rural finance \nsector.  Retail-level  institutions  include  commercial  banks,  regional  rural  banks  (RRB),  the \ncooperative credit structure (CCS), and microfinance institutions1 operating at the state, district, \nand local/community levels through their extensive branch network. At the operational level, the \napex  rural  finance  institution\u2014the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \n(NABARD)\u2014provides  refinance,  audit  and  supervision,  training,  and  policy  and  operational \nguidance  to  rural  finance  institutions.  The  National  Agricultural  Insurance  Company  and \ncommodity futures markets (CFM) are also integral to the rural finance sector. The formal retail \nbanking sector is depicted in Figure A1 (page 38). \n \nTable A1.1: Credit and Deposit in Formal Banking System  \n(as of 31 March 2005)a \nLoans per \nDeposits Loans  Loans to  Office \nItem  Offices  Percent  (Rs billion) Percent  (Rs billion) Percent  Deposits  (Rs million) \nPublic Sector CBs  47,688  24  16,040  67  10,720  62  67  225 \nForeign CBs   236  0  1,118  5  988  6  88  4,187 \nRegional Rural Banks  14,372  7  706  3  395  2  56  27 \nPrivate Sector CBs   6,385  3  4,065  17  3,072  18  76  481 \nSubtotal CBs  68,681  34  21,931  91  15,175  87  69  221 \nRural Cooperative \nBanks and Credit \nSocieties  121,661  61  1,454  6  1,757  10  121  14 \nUrban Cooperative  8,960  4  641  3  418  2  111  79 \nBanks \nTotal Formal System  199,302  100  24,025  100  17,350  100  73  89 \nRuralb  167,507  84  6,742  28  4,542  26  67  27 \nUrban  31,795  16  17,283  72  12,808  74  76  412 \nCB = commercial bank. \na Includes both urban and rural sectors. \nb Rural includes network classified by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as semi-urban.  \nSource: RBI Quarterly Banking Statistics, March 2006; and RBI Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2004\u2013\n2005, Developments in Cooperative Banking (2005).  \n3.  The RBI conducts monetary policy and regulates and supervises all banks. The RBI has \ndelegated the off- and on-site supervision of the CCS and RRBs to NABARD (Appendix 2). The \nstate  governments  also  exercise  supervision  of  the  CCS.  Established  in  2001,  the  Credit \nInformation Bureau of India Limited collects data on consumer and commercial credit in 42 million \nrecords from 50 financial institutions.  \n                                                 \n1  Microfinance institutions refer to the entire range of institutions providing microfinance services whether as a nonbank \nfinance company, a mutually aided cooperative society, or nongovernment organization.  ", "Appendix 1  33 \nC.  Rural Banking and Credit  \n4.  Commercial bank (rural branches), RRBs, and CCS provide services to nearly 90 million \nborrowers  through  a  network  of  more  than  167,000  offices  mobilizing  about  28%  of  India\u2019s \ndeposits and providing 26% of its loans. Table A1.2 highlights significant differences in branch \noutreach and target clientele among the different types of service providers. The rural CCS has by \nfar the largest office network and borrowing clientele reaching well over 60 million borrowers with \naverage loans of about $600. On average, a rural branch is only 6.5% of an urban branch in terms \nof loans.  \nTable A1.2: India Rural Banking Service Coveragea (as of 31 March 2005) \nOffices  Borrowers  Credit  Average \nItem  (%)  (million)  Percent  (Rs billion)  Percent  Loan Size $\nRural Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies  72.0  60.3  70.0  1,757.0  38.0  633.0 \nRegional Rural Banks  9.0  6.1  7.0  395.0  9.0  1,406.0 \nCommercial Banks  19.0  20.2  23.0  2,391.0  53.0  2,573.0 \nTotal Formal Rural Finance Institutions  100.0  86.6  100.0  4,543.0  100.0  1,140.0 \na The totals may not agree in some cases due to rounding off. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India Quarterly Banking Statistics, March 2006; and Reserve Bank of India (2005). \n5.  Commercial Banks. Commercial banks, in particular, public sector commercial banks \n(PSCB) have a large office network to serve the rural economy. Services include deposits which \nprovide rural customers with an investment outlet. With about 20 million borrowers, the commercial \nbanks are key lenders in rural India. The commercial banks provide a wide range of loans at an \naverage size of about $2,600. Although very substantial in volume, commercial banks tend to \nemphasize services to the semi-urban segment and upper and middle segments of the rural \nfinance market. However, some private commercial banks have recently successfully established \ninnovative lending at the village level through (i) qualified nongovernment organizations with a \nproven track record, (ii) value chain financing, and (iii) credit card products.  \n6.  With the reforms initiated since the early 1990s, RBI has tightened prudential regulation of \nthe  banking  sector.  Improved  norms  for  capital  adequacy,  income-recognition,  and  asset \nclassification led to a realistic presentation of financial statements and a widening gap between \nstrong and weak banks. The number of private banks has increased and the Government took \neffective  measures  to  strengthen  independence  and  professionalization  of  PSCBs,  which \ndominate the system. PSCBs may now raise up to 49% of capital from the public. During 2005, the \ncommercial banks reported adequate profitability, capital adequacy, and asset quality.  \nTable A1.3: Commercial Banks (as of 31 March 2005) \u2013 Key Indicators  \n(%) \nWeighted   SBI and  Nationalized  Foreign   Private \nItem  Average  Best  Worst  Affiliates  Banks  Banks  Banks \nROA  1.0  9.6   (2.0)  0.9  0.9  2.1  1.1 \nCRAR   12.2  136.9  1.0  11.5  12.4  12.6  12.5 \nNPL  1.2  0.0  41.6  1.4  1.3  0.8  1.0 \nCRAR = Capital to risk assets ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROA = Return on Assets, SBI = State Bank of India.  \nSource: Reserve Bank of India Annual Banking Statistics, March 2006. \n7.  Regional  Rural  Banks.  There  are  196  RRBs  with  14,372  branches  operating  in  the \ncountry. RRBs typically cover 1 to 3 districts. Established under the RRB Act, 1976, the RRBs \nhave been capitalized by the Government (50%), the state governments (15%), and sponsoring \nPSCBs (35%). RRBs play a limited role on the national scale but are important service providers to \nthe rural poor in some states. RRBs currently serve about 6.6 million clients at an average loan \nsize of about $1,400, and an overall share of about 9% of the rural credit market. Compared to the ", "34  Appendix 1 \ncommercial banks, the RRBs serve smaller customers. RRBs tend to be more active in deposit \nmobilization compared to lending with a credit to deposit ratio of 56%.  \nTable A1.4: Regional Rural Banks \u2013 Key Financial Performance Indicators  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \nEquity to  Deposits  Loans to \nTotal  Assets as  to Total  Total  Provisions Net \nAssets  Deposits  Loans  Assets  of Total   Assets   Assets   NPL Ratio  to NPL   Margin \nItem  (Rs billion)  (Rs billion) (Rs billion) (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nState with Largest \nNetwork  162.0  130.9  47.6  10.0  23.0  81.0  29.0  17.0  35.0    1.1 \nNext Seven States  348.8  275.9  142.5  7.0  50.0  79.0  41.0  12.0  32.0  (0.2) \nAll 26 States  702.9  563.5  261.1  8.0  100.0  80.0  37.0  13.0  35.0  0.1 \nLowest  0.2  0.3  0.1  4.0  0.0  69.0  18.0  4.0  23.0  (5.7) \nHighest  162.0  130.9  47.6  22.0  23.0  91.0  70.0  74.0  76.0  2.4 \nNPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: Report of the internal working group on regional rural bank reforms, Reserve Bank of India (2005). \n8.  The limited area of operation, narrow client base, high cost of servicing small accounts, \nand inadequate skills have considerably weakened the RRBs. In the process, RRBs have drifted \nfrom their core objective of banking with the poor and have accumulated overheads without regard \nto efficiency. During 1995\u20131999, recapitalization support equivalent to $500 million was provided \nalong with intensive institutional development support. As a result, the asset quality of RRBs \nimproved and the nonperforming assets were halved. During 2004, 156 RRBs earned profits with \n97 having wiped off their accumulated losses and built up collective reserves of $500 million. \nCurrently, consolidation of RRBs in contiguous areas for realizing operating synergies is ongoing. \nWhile  the  overall  institutional  status  of  RRBs  is  improving,  continued  support,  and  human \nresources development assistance are required to consolidate their position.  \n9.  Rural  Cooperative  Banks.  The  CCS  in  most  states  comprises  separate  delivery \nstructures for long-term credit, and short-term credit.  \n10.  Long-term CCS includes 20 state cooperative agriculture and rural development banks \nand 768 primary cooperative agricultural and rural development banks with a network of about \n2,000 offices serving about 9 million borrowers. In Andhra Pradesh and four north-eastern states, \nshort-term and long-term CCS are merged. The long-term CCS draws its resources largely from \nNABARD\u2019s refinance program and also benefits from NABARD\u2019s special liquidity support program. \nDespite this, about two-thirds of the long-term CCS entities reported losses during the financial \nyear 2004. Nonperforming loans increased by 4.5% to 31% in 2004 and collection of dues was \nreported at below 44%. Table A1.5 illustrates key performance indicators. Since the classification \nof risk assets does not follow standards applicable for banks, loss provisions are likely to be \ninadequate. \nTable A1.5: Performance of the Long-term Cooperative Credit Structure  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \nEntities  Equity Loans to Sub- Doubtful \nReporting  to Total  Total  NPL to standardand Loss  Provisions \n  Profit  Assets  Deposits Loans  Assets  Assets Loans  Loans  Loans  to NPL \nItem  (%)  (Rs billion) (Rs billion) (Rs billion) (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nSCARDBs  53.0  209.9  6.1  162.1  17.0  77.0  27.0  16.0  11.0  19.0 \nPCARDBs  37.0  151.0  2.5  112.0  20.0  74.0  36.0  18.0  18.0  24.0 \nNPL = nonperforming loan, PCARDB = primary cooperative agricultural and rural development bank, SCARDB = state \ncooperative agriculture and rural development bank. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. 2005.

In view of the extremely poor performance of the long-term structure, the Government has \nestablished a high-level special committee to develop restructuring options. The Committee has \nsubmitted a report, which is currently under consideration by the Government. The long-term CCS \nis exposed to severe governance and accountability issues and there are doubts as to whether the \nparallel existence of both the long- and short-term CCS is justified.  \n12.  Short-term Credit Cooperatives. The short-term CCS is a federated structure of three \ntiers,  including  state  cooperative  banks  (SCB)  as the  apex-body  in  the  state,  district  central \ncooperative banks (DCCB) federated to the SCB, and primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) \nat the village-level federated to the respective DCCBs. The short-term CCS maintains the largest \ncredit  network  in  India  representing  about  two-thirds  of  the  offices  and  serving  120  million \nmembers, including 51 million or 70% of rural borrowers in March 2004. The short-term CCS \nprovides one-third of formal rural credit.2  \n13.  The SCBs mobilize resources and intermediate surpluses to provide financial support to \nthe DCCBs, while serving a few larger state-level cooperatives and agro-businesses. Besides \nSCBs\u2019 funding, the DCCBs draw significant customer deposits through their extensive branch \nnetwork. The PACSs are the DCCBs\u2019 primary borrowers. Similar to the SCBs, DCCBs provide \ndirect lending to a few large cooperatives and private agro-businesses at the district level. While \nthe countrywide CCS at the SCB and DCCB levels draws major resources from deposits, some \nstates rely in a major way on borrowings from NABARD. The state governments own equity in the \nshort-term CCS in selected states and entities.  \nTable A1.6: Performance of the Short-term Cooperative Credit Structure  \n(As of 31 March 2004)  \nEquity  Loans  Doubtful \nEntities  to  to  NPL to  Sub-  and  Provisions \nReporting  Losses/  Total  Total  Total  standard  Loss  to Total \nProfit   Equity  Assets  Deposits  Loans  Assets  Assets  Loans  Loans  Loans  NPL \nItem  (%)  (%)  (Rs billion)  (Rs billion)  (Rs billion)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nSCBs  87.0  3.0  678.4  434.9  351.1  13.0  52.0  19.0  9.0  9.0  57.0 \nDCCBs  72.0  26.0  1,256.9  791.5  671.5  15.0  53.0  23.0  12.0  11.0  45.0 \nPACSs  51.0  22.0  608.0  181.4  438.7  14.0  72.0  37.0  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, NPL = nonperforming loan, PACS = primary agricultural credit society, \nSCB = state cooperative bank. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. 2005.

Statutory audits \nrate the SCBs as being satisfactory, while audits of DCCBs identified substantial issues, including \nlack of office automation and poor record keeping. Audits rate PACSs as being largely insufficient. \nThe  poor  audit  results  emphasize  the  need  to  establish  a  comprehensive  audit  system  and \nautomation to support rigorous internal and off-site controls. While SCBs are reportedly profitable, \nthe DCCBs, the backbone of the short-term system, report a substantial erosion of equity and \ndeposits resulting from weak loan management in its own offices and the PACSs as their primary \nclients.  As  presented  in  Table  A1.6,  nonperforming  loans  are  at  alarming  levels  and  the \nweaknesses of the PACSs at the grassroots level have had a cascading effect over the whole \nshort-term CCS. \nD.  Other Rural Finance Sector Institutions  \n15.  Commodity Futures Markets. CFMs in India date back from 1875 and comprise 24 \ncommodity exchanges, of which three are multi-commodity exchanges with online trading systems \nand the remaining are single commodity exchanges. However, commodity-wise segmentation, \n                                                 \n2  Appendix 3 describes the potential outreach and financial performance of the various tiers in the participating states. ", "36  Appendix 1 \nregional dispersal, and separate spot and forward markets in commodities has impeded better \nprice realization and marketing efficiency for agricultural produce. Addressing these concerns will \nrequire  effective  market  regulation  and  strengthening  of  the  entire  downstream  systems  for \nenhancing the participation of small rural producers in CFMs and facilitating remunerative prices \nfor them.  \n \n16.  Risk Mitigation. The ongoing National Agricultural Insurance Scheme provides insurance \ncover for food crops, oilseeds, and selected annual commercial crops. Indebted farmers (i.e., \nborrowers of seasonal agricultural loans) are covered on a compulsory basis, while nonindebted \nfarmers may be covered on a voluntary basis. So far, the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme \nhas only reached about 18 million, mainly small farms, out of a total of about 120 million farms, \nand has experienced recurring losses. Currently, the World Bank is providing technical support to \ngradually increase coverage of agricultural insurance.  \n \nE.  Agriculture Sector  \n \n17.  Agricultural policies have historically sought to ensure self-sufficiency in wheat and rice, the \nmain staple grains, which continue to the present day even though grain production has been \nmore than enough to satisfy domestic demand for quite some time. The \u201cfood subsidy\u201d covers the \ncost of price support, distribution, and storage of wheat and rice, and the total cost remains the \nequivalent of about 5% of annual government expenditure. The Government also subsidizes other \nfarm  inputs,  including  fertilizer,  power,  and  irrigation  water,  pushing  the  total  subsidy  bill  for \nagriculture much higher. \n \n18.  The  large  subsidy  cost  and  its  fiscal  impact  have  dampened  public  investment  in \nagriculture for more than a decade. Although private investment has grown rapidly, it still remains \nvery small in aggregate terms, amounting to only about 1.5% of sector output, compared to about \n25% for the entire economy. Private investment in agriculture has been discouraged by an array of \nmarket regulations and licensing requirements that, among others, have restricted private storage \nand movement of major agricultural commodities, and limited the scale of food processing and \nvalue addition. Weak incentives have also resulted in significant underinvestment in agricultural \nmarketing, which has created highly fragmented marketing chains and inhibited vertical integration \nof production and processing. The resulting market inefficiency causes farmers to receive smaller \nshares of the final consumer price, thus reducing overall returns from farming. \n \n19.  Policies  that  have  long  inhibited  private  investment  incentives  and  fragmented  the \nmarketing system are beginning to be changed. The most significant changes thus far have been \nin market access, including the liberalization of import policies completed in 2001 as required by \nthe  World  Trade  Organization.  Restrictions  on  food  imports  that  taxed  local  producers  and \nprecluded competitive export industries began to decline in the 1990s. These reforms have helped \nto stimulate agricultural trade, but also exposed inefficiencies in the domestic marketing system. In \nresponse,  the  Government  and  several  state  governments  have  begun  to  lift  longstanding \nrestrictions that impede private storage and interstate movement of grain and other essential \ncommodities.  Licenses  are  no  longer  needed  to  establish  food  processing  operations,  and \nregulations restricting their size have mostly been eliminated. In addition, foreign investment in \nfood  processing  and  marketing  ventures  (excluding  retail)  is  now  automatically  approved  for \ninvestments up to 51% of the project cost.  \n \n20.  Other  key  changes  underway  that  improve  the  investment  environment  include  the \nintroduction  of  selective  exemptions  to  the  highly  restrictive  Agricultural  Produce  Marketing \nCommittee Act to facilitate contract farming arrangements. With the agriculture sector dominated \nby large numbers of small farmers, food processors typically have difficulty procuring agricultural ", "Appendix 1  37 \nproduce  for  their  operations.  Contract  farming  is  expanding  rapidly  and  has  proven  to  be \nsuccessful in reducing marketing risks faced by both buyers and sellers and increasing farmers\u2019 \nincomes. However, such arrangements are still not recognized or protected by current laws. Such \npractices  could  expand  more  rapidly  with  stronger  legal  protections  in  place,  particularly \nwidespread adoption of the model amendment to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee \nAct, which directly allows private sector participation in agricultural marketing. \n \n21.  A related set of reforms now under consideration involve changes in laws regulating the \nleasing of agricultural land. At present, inadequate protection for both lessors and lessees limits \nthe use of land rentals to assemble larger and potentially more efficient land holdings. Another \nexpected reform is the streamlining of food safety laws and their alignment with international \nstandards.  A  major  overhaul  of  the  food  law  aimed  at  consolidation  of  responsibilities  and \njurisdiction, as well as reorientation toward international standards, is now underway, although \nthere is no set time frame for its completion.  \n \nF.  Rural Finance Sector Reforms  \n \n22.  The rural finance sector institutions to varying degrees are affected by weak governance, \ninadequate autonomy, regulatory forbearance and overlaps, poor portfolio quality, and institutional \ncapacity constraints. The lack of robust rural finance markets is reflected in a number of indicators, \nincluding declining agricultural growth, farmer distress, and growing rural-urban disparities. As part \nof the ongoing financial liberalization, the reform of the commercial banks and the RRBs is yielding \npositive results. However, substantive reforms of the CCS could not be implemented in view of \ndiffering perceptions on the role of the CCS. Nevertheless, the access that the CCS provides to \nthe  rural  households  underlies  its  significance,  particularly  when  commercial  banks  are \ninstitutionally appropriate for serving the middle and upper market segments and RRBs are also \nmoving upmarket.  \n \n23.  In the context of Government\u2019s endeavor to reform the CCS, the following will need to be \ninitiated in a phased manner to fundamentally address the underlying causes of weakness. \n \n(i)  Policy: A policy framework that enables the CCS to operate with autonomy in \nbusiness decisions and without interference in collection of receivables.  \n(ii)  Ownership: The CCS, as member-based institution, must serve the interests of the \nmembers and be insulated from state government interventions and nonfinancial \ncontrols.  \n(iii)  Governance:  Governance  standards  applied  to  commercial  banks  must  be \nmainstreamed in the CCS to ensure appropriate fiduciary prudence in this vast \nnetwork. \n(iv)  Regulation: Autonomy of CCS must accompany effective regulation and enhanced \nprudential norms that eliminate regulatory forbearance and overlaps. \n(v)  Institutional: Systems and procedures in the CCS need to reflect the successful \ninstitutional practices adopted for cost-effective service delivery.  \n(vi)  Financial  Restructuring:  The  CCS,  with  probability  of  turnaround,  needs  to  be \nfinancially restructured to resume operations under the new paradigm.  \n24.  Considering the multitude of deep-seated problems, changes can be expected only over \nthe medium term and, therefore, priorities need to be decided for phasing and sequencing of \ninterventions. The prevailing political economy requires that reforms be phased in order to mitigate \ndisruptions,  if  any,  in  service  delivery  and  corresponding  contingency  measures,  wherever \nrequired. However, in order to succeed, the CCS reforms must frontload policy, legal, regulatory, \nand governance reforms and apply core principles of governance and accountability as eligibility \ncriteria. In addition, benchmarking with tangible performance indicators should be applied. Overall, ", "38  Appendix 1 \nthe  CCS  will  also  need  to  proactively  enhance  linkages  with  the  self-help  groups  wherever \npossible to pool its efforts with those of the nongovernment organizations. It is natural for major \nreform initiatives, such as that envisaged for the CCS, to result in some attrition.  \n \n25.  Initiation of CCS reforms in isolation would lead to sub-optimal results. The impact of \nrobust rural finance markets can be fully realized only if accompanied with effective risk mitigation, \nCFMs,  and  secured  transaction  reforms.  While  the  Asian  Development  Bank  is  helping  the \nGovernment in CFM and secured transactions reforms, the World Bank is assisting in enhancing \nthe  coverage  of  risk  mitigation.  Along  with  the  evolving  framework  for  commercializing  the \nagriculture sector (paras. 17\u201321), these constitute elements for a favorable CCS reform outcome \nand impacts.  \n \nFigure A1: Formal Retail Banking Sector \n \nCooperative Credit  Scheduled Commercial  Regional Rural Banks \n  Structure  Banks (98)  (196) \n \n \nMetropolitan \n  Urban (2,015)  Rural \nBranches (8,664) \n \n  \n  ST Structure   LT Structure  Urban Branches  Urban Branches \n  (10,715) \n(580)  \n  SCBs (31)  SCARDBs (20)\n \nSemi Urban Branches \n  Semi Urban \n(14,813) \nBranches (2,422)  \n \n \n \n  DCCBs  Branches  Branches  PCARDBs \n(368)  (847)  (887) (768)\n \n \nBranches \n \n(1,091)\n \nBranches  PACSs \n \n(12,652)  (105,735) \n \n \nRural Branches  Rural Branches \n \n(32,244)  (11,370) \n \n \n \n  Depositors and Borrowers \n \nD CCB = district central cooperative bank, LT = long-term, PACS = primary agricultural credit society, PCARDB = \np rimary cooperative agriculture and rural development bank, SCARDB = state cooperative agriculture and rural \ndevelopment bank, SCB = state cooperative bank, ST = short-term. \n \nNote: Commercial banks include 94 scheduled commercial banks and 4 non-scheduled commercial banks. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. ", "Appendix 2  39 \nTHE NATIONAL BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n1.  Mandate. Established in 1982 through an act of Parliament, the National Bank for \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development\u2019s  (NABARD)  mandate  is  to  promote  development  of \nagriculture and the rural economy, and improve the livelihood of farmers and small businesses \nin rural India. NABARD fulfills its mandate through (i) refinance (both short and long term), (ii) \ntraining,  (iii)  funding  special  rural  development  programs,  and  (iv)  surveillance  of  the \ncooperative credit structure (CCS) and regional rural banks (RRB). \n2.  Ownership and Management Oversight. Owned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) \n(72.5%) and the Government of India (Government) (27.5%), NABARD is overseen by an 11 \nmember board chaired by a full time chairman, and represented by a deputy governor, RBI; joint \nsecretary  Ministry  of  Finance,  Banking  Division;  secretaries  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment; high-level officials from two state governments; two private sector members; one \nfrom  academia;  and  the  managing  director  of  NABARD.  The  Board  has  established  four \ncommittees to oversee the operations of the bank in (i) executive matters, (ii) project (credit) \nrural  infrastructure  schemes,  (iii)  audit,  and  (iv)  risk  management.  The  committees  are \ncomposed of board members, and the chairman heads, all, except the audit committee.  \n3.  Organization, Management, and Staffing. Headquartered in Mumbai, NABARD has \nregional offices in each state, and covers 83% of all districts through its extensive branch \nnetwork with 5,230 staff. The management team is composed of the managing director and five \nexecutive directors. NABARD\u2019s headquarters is composed of 28 departments headed by chief \ngeneral managers, which can be broadly classified according to the following functions: (i) \nplanning,  policy,  and  research;  (ii)  credit;  (iii)  institutional  development,  monitoring,  and \nsurveillance; (iv) accounting, audit, finance, legal, and information technology; (v) administration \nand human resources; and (vi) public relations and company secretariat. The regional offices \nare chaired by a chief general manager and mirror the functions at headquarters. \n4.  Operations.1 Consistent with its mandate, lending (refinance) to the CCS, RRBs, and \ncommercial  banks  constitute  about  three  quarters  of  NABARD\u2019s  outstanding  loans.  The \nrefinance portfolio grew 11% slightly exceeding overall growth of assets in financial years 2004 \nand 2005. About three-fourths of the refinancing is at tenures exceeding 1 year. About 4% of \nloans now constitute lending to distressed state cooperative banks, which underscore the need \nfor comprehensive CCS reforms. The significance of the CCS in NABARD\u2019s refinance dropped \nover the last 3 years and that of commercial banks increased. NABARD\u2019s loan portfolio also \nincludes 26% loans for special projects, which are lent directly to state governments.  \n5.  The bulk of NABARD\u2019s lending is guaranteed by the Government and state governments \nand risk weighted assets constitute only 40% of its overall assets. However, risk weighted \nassets increased by an annual rate of 20% during financial years 2004 and 2005, double the \ngrowth  of  total  assets,  and  may  indicate  a  shift  in  NABARD\u2019s  lending  policies.  Unlike \ncommercial banks, NABARD has no classified loans, which reflect the underlying government \nguarantees. NABARD recently introduced lending at its own risk, which constitutes 0.34% of its \nloan portfolio. NABARD\u2019s 10 largest borrowers absorb 30% of its assets either through direct \nexposures to state governments, or state-owned or -supported entities. Exposure to the states \nof Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh constitutes 21% of assets. NABARD holds \n5% of total assets in cash and bank deposits. As a result of its predominant long-term funding, \nNABARD could invest 3% of its assets in high interest bearing government bonds.  \n                                                 \n1  NABARD\u2019s financial year (April\u2013March) coincides with the Government\u2019s fiscal year. Unless otherwise stated, the \nfigures indicated in this Appendix refer to the status as on 31 March 2006 for the financial year 2005.  ", "40  Appendix 2 \n6.  Consistent with its role as an apex bank, the lending limits under NABARD\u2019s refinance \nprograms are based on internal assessment of the soundness of participating banks and the \ngovernment  guarantees.  NABARD  established  a  board  committee  on  risk  management  to \nintroduce systems and processes for improving its risk management systems  and internal \ncontrols in line with the reforms taking place at the commercial banks. Under Government \ndirectives, NABARD\u2019s loan pricing is uniform for credit products and administrative cost, and risk \ncriteria do not play a role in pricing. When the Government sets interest rates of NABARD\u2019s \nprograms below market rates, it provides the requisite support from its budget.  \n7.  Funding. NABARD\u2019s equity and quasi-equity constitute a solid 9% of its total balance \nsheet  and  almost  one-fourth  of  its  balance  sheet  constitutes  special  development  funds. \nDeposits of banks constitute 21% of NABARD\u2019s balance sheet, and bonds and debentures \n(mostly at favorable tax or regulatory terms) witnessed a strong growth during the last 3 years \nand now amount to 31% of its funding. Borrowing has declined as a source of funds; however, \nlow cost borrowing from the RBI remains significant.  \n8.  Prudential Supervision. Consistent with Article 35(6) of the Banking Regulation Act, \n1949, RBI delegated the supervisory powers over RRBs and the CCS to NABARD. However, \nthe  prerogative  of  licensing  remains  with  the  RBI.  At  its  headquarters,  a  supervision  and \ninspection department is responsible for off- and on-site surveillance of the RRBs and the CCS, \nwhile on-site inspections are de facto carried out by NABARD\u2019s regional offices. NABARD \nreports that overall, 416 banks (including 296 CCS institutions) have been inspected. About \n20% of SCBs, and one-third of district central cooperative banks, were identified with significant \nerosion of capital and deposits as a result of large nonperforming loans.  \n9.  Training and Capacity Building. The institutional development department supports \nthe RRBs and the CCS through targeted training and capacity building programs. NABARD \noperates six training facilities for the purpose. Training is also supported by the regional offices. \nThe institutional development department formulates policies and provides recommendations on \nbranch licensing, appointment of senior staff, audit, and human resource issues in RRBs and \nCCS.  It  conducts  performance  reviews  of  RRBs  and  CCS  and  also  (i)  administers  the \nCooperative Development Fund for providing financial support for institutional building, and (ii) \nmonitors the Development Action Plans (DAP). \n10.  DAPs are implemented nationwide to facilitate the turnaround of CCS entities into viable \ninstitutions. The performance obligations (financial, operational, and efficiency indicators) arising \nout  of  DAPs  are  formalized  as  deliverables  between  NABARD  and  the  apex  cooperative \nstructures. The apex structures, in turn, develop DAPs and agree on performance targets with \ntheir respective lower tiers. This process extends up to the level of primary agricultural credit \nsocieties. While the DAP has been institutionalized within the CCS, the outcome has not been \npositive in view of the longstanding policy, legal, and governance issues in the CCS.  \n11.  Financial Performance. NABARD reported a decline in revenues, essentially in interest \nrevenues on loans over the last 2 years, which partly reflect a drop in interest rates. This decline \nwas only partly matched by a simultaneous reduction in interest costs and the net interest \nmargin  dropped  significantly  from  90  to  70  basis  points  over  2005.  The  high  returns  on \ngovernment bonds (44 basis points above average revenue on interest bearing assets) and low \ncost of borrowing from RBI (24 basis point below average cost of funding) helped mitigate this \nadverse impact. While the gearing ratio of 11:4 (debt to equity) appears high, the real impact is \nsubstantially reduced by the high level of guarantees that support NABARD\u2019s operations.  ", "Appendix 2  41 \n12.  About two-thirds of NABARD\u2019s loans mature within 3 years. Benefiting from long-term \nresources provided by  the Government and foreign donors and to a lesser extent market \nborrowings, NABARD\u2019s liabilities beyond tenure of 7 years are significant and largely exceed its \ncorresponding loan exposure at the same tenor. Typically, NABARD lends the funds in multiple \ncycles. NABARD is only marginally exposed to foreign exchange risk, which is mitigated by \nGovernment  cover  or  through  cross  currency  swaps.  A  summary  of  NABARD\u2019s  financial \nstatements and key performance indicators are in Table A2 below. \nTable A2: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \u2013 Summary Financial \nStatements and Key Performance Indicators \nStructure  Average Annual \n2003  2004  2005  2005   Growth 2003\u20132005 \nItem  (Rs billion)  (Rs billion)  (Rs billion)  (%)  (%) \nAssets  558.90  607.80  676.10  100.00  10.00 \nCash and Bank Balances  29.00  54.80  43.00  6.00  34.00 \nInvestments  24.10  51.40  32.80  5.00  38.00 \nRefinance Loans to FIs  347.80  378.40  429.30  64.00  11.00 \nDirect Loans (special funds)  140.10  105.20  151.60  22.00  10.00 \nRisk Weighted Assets  190.90  217.90  272.80  40.00  20.00 \nLiabilities and Equity  558.90  607.80  676.00  100.00  10.00 \nEquity and Quasi-equity  52.40  54.30  59.30  9.00  10.00 \nSpecial Reserves and Funds  174.20  183.80  189.40  28.00  27.00 \nDeposits  121.50  92.20  140.50  21.00  14.00 \nBonds and Debentures  118.80  172.00  208.10  31.00  33.00 \nBorrowings  75.50  89.30  61.90  9.00  (6.00) \nProfit (after tax)  11.20  10.30  8.60  \u2014  (12.00) \nIncome on Loans and Investments  42.70  39.40  39.40  \u2014  (4.00) \nInterest and Financial Charges  23.70  21.10  22.00  \u2014  (3.00) \nOther Expenses  4.40  4.90  5.70  \u2014  51.00 \nROA (% average)  0.01  1.80  1.30  \u2014  \u2014 \nROE (% average including reserves)  0.02  19.00  14.40  \u2014  \u2014 \nNet Interest Margin (%)  0.01  0.90  0.70  \u2014  \u2014 \nDebt/Equity  10.70  11.20  11.40  \u2014  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, FI = financial institution, ROA = return on asset, ROE = return on equity. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Audited Financial Statements, 2003, 2004, and 2005; \nAsian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n13.  Audit  and  Internal  Controls.  NABARD\u2019s  audit  function  is  overseen  by  an  audit \ncommittee under its board chaired by deputy governor of RBI. This provides the necessary \nindependence from management. The audit department reports directly to the committee. The \ndepartment bases its work on annual audit plans. Off-site surveillance is supported through an \nautomated system introduced in 1999.       \n14.  NABARD\u2019s  Role  in  CCS  Reforms.  As  the  apex  rural  finance  agency,  NABARD \nprovided  the  analytical  base  for  the  task  force  on  revitalizing  the  CCS  and  significantly \ncontributed to the consensus building on the CCS reform agenda. On the acceptance of task \nforce recommendations, NABARD set up the Department for Cooperative Revitalization and \nReforms  at  its  headquarters  to  provide  focused  attention  to  CCS  reforms  by  drawing  on \nresources of its supervision, institutional development, training, and refinance departments. \nNABARD assumes significant direct responsibility for CCS reform especially on institutional \ndevelopment and monitoring as a co-signatory of the memorandum of understanding with the \nGovernment  and  the  state  governments.  NABARD  also  provides  support  to  the  National \nImplementation and Monitoring Committee in coordinating nationwide CCS reforms. In addition, \nwith state and district level presence, NABARD is expected to provide resource and technical \nsupport  to  the  state-level  implementation  committees  and  district-level  implementation \ncommittees to be established for CCS reforms. Ongoing DAPs are expected to be adapted for \nCCS reform monitoring.  ", "42  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR \n(as of 30 August 2006) \n \nA.

Population, Income, and Public Administration. Similar to India\u2019s overall pattern, about \ntwo-thirds  to  four-fifths  of  the  population  of  the  participating  states  (PS)  live  in  rural  areas. \nGrassroots membership in the primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) is significant in India, \ncovering about 17.5% of the rural population. Andhra Pradesh significantly exceeds this average \nwith 30%, while Gujarat and Rajasthan are significantly below that average with about 10%. Per \ncapita income in Gujarat and Maharashtra largely exceed the national average, while that for \nMadhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Rajasthan are substantially below. Except for Maharashtra, where \nliteracy exceeds the national average by 12% points, overall literacy in the other PSs is near the \nnational average. However, a substantial divide exists between male and female literacy. In \nparticular, in Rajasthan, male literacy exceeds that of females by 30% points. Literacy in the rural \nareas of most of the PSs is slightly below the national average. A substantial portion of India\u2019s \npopulation lives below the poverty line. Compared to the national average, poverty is more \npronounced in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. The PSs\u2019 characteristics underline the importance of \nwell functioning rural finance institutions, especially the cooperative credit structure (CCS) that \nhas very substantial coverage at the grassroots level. \nTable A6.1: Social and Demographic Indicators \u2013 India and Participating States \n    Andhra    Maha-  Madhya    Rajas-\nIndices  India   Pradesh   Gujarat  rashtra  Pradesh  Orissa  than \nPopulation (million)  1,027  76  51  97  60  37  56 \nRural Population (% of total)  72  73  63  55  73  85  77 \nCooperative Members (million)  135  17.0  3.0  10.3  6.2  4.1  4.7 \nNumber of Districts  604  23  25  35.  45  30  32 \nNumber of Villages  638,000  26,586  18,618  43,722  51,806  51,349  41,353 \nGDP per capita (Rs)  20,989  20,757  26,979  29,204  14,011  12,388  14,748 \nGDP per capita in % of India  100  99  129  139  67  59  70 \nPopulation below Poverty Line (%)a  25  16  14  25  37  47  15 \nHuman Development Index 2001  0.47  0.42  0.48  0.58  0.39  0.4  0.42 \nLiteracy Rate (%)  65  61  66  77  64  64  61 \nMale Literacy Rate (%)  76  71  76  86  77  76  76 \nFemale Literacy Rate (%)  54  51  56  68  51  51  44 \nRural Literacy Rate (%)  59  55  62  71  58  60  56 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na   The Planning Commission defines the poverty line as a per capita monthly expenditure of Rs49 in rural and Rs57 in urban areas at \n1973\u201374 prices.

Structure and Size. The short-term CCS is organized into three tiers including state \ncooperative banks (SCB), district central cooperative banks (DCCB), and PACSs at the village \nlevel.1 While the India-wide CCS at the SCB and DCCB levels draws major resources from \ndeposits, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa rely in a major way on borrowings from the National Bank \nfor  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD).  PACSs  are  not  licensed  as  banks  and \nprohibited from deposit taking. However, laws of some PSs allow PACSs to operate as mini \nbanks.  While  SCBs  and  DCCBs  are  to  supervise  the  lower  tiers  of  the  CCS,  inadequate \nresources and lack of automation make it currently impossible to fulfill this mandate. Table A6.2 \nillustrates the structure and size of the CCS in the PSs. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Andhra Pradesh cooperative credit structure provides both short-term and long-term credit under one institutional \nstructure. \n ", "60  Appendix 6 \nTable A6.2: Structure and Size of the Cooperative Credit Structure (as of 31 March 2004)a \n                                  in Rs billion \n  India   Andhra    Maha-  Madhya    Rajas-\nItem     Pradesh   Gujarat  rashtra  Pradesh  Orissa  than \nSCB Number  31  1  1  1  1  1  1 \nAssets  678  63  36  178  25  20  24 \nDeposits  435  19  23  134  16  11  11 \nBorrowings  162  31  10  14  6  7  10 \nDCCBs Number  368  22  18  31  38  17  27 \nAssets  1,257  90  91  333  65  32  41 \nDeposits  792  25  65  248  39  18  23 \nBorrowings  202  47  14  23  12  11  13 \nPACSsb number  105,735  4,779  7,768  20,952  4,526  2,729  5,252 \nTotal Assets  688  53  31  89  32  19  17 \nDeposits  181  3  1  1  3  5  1 \nBorrowings  493  43  24  71  25  13  16 \nDCCB = district central cooperative bank, PACS = primary agricultural credit society, SCB = state cooperative bank. \na Financial information provided throughout the cooperative credit structure is not reliable since audits are not \nconducted independently. \nb   Primary Agricultural Credit Societies in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh as of 31 March 2002. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n3.  Legal Framework. Cooperative Societies Acts (CSA) promulgated by the PSs govern the \nCCS. The CSAs allow for the constitution of the CCS as member-owned entities. However, the \nCCS has become an instrument of state intervention in the rural economy. The CSAs assign \nexcessive powers to the registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) in governance and day-to-day \nbusiness decisions. For example, the RCS in Rajasthan is concurrently the administrator of the \nSCB, which points to conflicting business and supervision mandates. To restore the true essence \nof cooperatives, a few states have since the mid-1990s established new parallel cooperative acts \nthat expressly preclude state ownership and restrict the powers of the RCS. Andhra Pradesh, \nMadhya Pradesh, and Orissa are among the PSs that have issued parallel cooperative acts. \nHowever, the CSAs do not contain provisions for enabling existing CCS to migrate to parallel \ncooperative acts. As a result, confusion and operational complications abound at all levels.   \nTable A6.3: Board Existence and Selection (as of 31 March 2003) \n \nAndhra    Maha-  Madhya    Rajas-\nItem  Pradesh  Gujarat  Rashtra  Pradesh  Orissa  than  Total \nSCBs               \nElected Board  \u2014  Yes  Yes  Yes  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \nSuperseded Boards  Yes  \u2014  \u2014  Yes  Yes  Yes  \u2014 \nof which Nominated Board  Yes  \u2014  \u2014  Yes  Yes   \u2014    \u2014 \nof which Administrator  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  Yes  \u2014 \nDCCBs (number)  22  18  31  38  17  27  153 \nElected Board  \u2014  16  23  4  \u2014  \u2014  43 \nSuperseded Boards  22  2  8  34  17  27  110 \nof which Nominated Board  22  2  \u2014  \u2014  17  \u2014   41 \nof which Administrator  \u2014  \u2014  8  34  \u2014  27  69 \n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, SCB = state cooperative bank. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n4.

The six SCBs in the PSs are owned by member DCCBs and the state governments. An \nSCB is usually managed by an administrator with a public service background. With the exception \nof Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the SCBs\u2019 position in the retail market is not significant in \nthe local context. Most SCBs have a share of 2\u20134% in the local deposit market and about 5\u20137% in \nthe lending market. All PSs, except Maharashtra and Gujarat, depend on external borrowings, of \nwhich NABARD is a prominent source. SCBs report high levels of nonperforming loans, especially \nin Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Although the SCBs would qualify for NABARD refinance \nwithout  guarantee,  most  of  the  exposure  to  NABARD  is  de  facto  guaranteed  by  the  state \ngovernment concerned.  \nTable A6.5: State Cooperative Banks \u2013 Key Financial Indicators (as of 31 March 2004) \nin Rs billion  \n  India  Andhra    Maha-  Madhya     \nItem     Pradesh  Gujarat  rashtra  Pradesh  Orissa  Rajasthan \nTotal Assets  678.4  63.1  36.1  177.7  25.1  20.1  24.1 \nLoans  351.1  51.6  19.4  76.4  17.0  12.8  15.3 \nDeposits  434.9  18.7  23.1  134.0  15.5  10.8  11.4 \nBorrowings  162.0  31.2  10.0  14.0  6.4  6.9  9.5 \nEquity and Reserves  81.5  13.2  3.0  29.7  3.2  2.4  3.2 \nLoans to Deposits (%)  81  276  84  57  110  119  134 \nMarket Share Deposits (%)  \u2014  2  2  3  3  4  2 \nMarket Share Loans (%)  \u2014  7  4  10  6  6  1 \nImpaired Loans/Loans (%)  19  19  11  37  10  9  2 \nDoubtful and Loss Loans/Loans (%)    3  2  18  6  3  2 \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n6.  Significant Erosion of Equity. NABARD\u2019s inspection and supervision in 2005 identified \nseven SCBs in India that had substantially eroded capital reserves and even deposits as a result \nof large nonperforming loans. This figure would increase substantially if standards similar to \n ", "62  Appendix 6 \ncommercial banks were applied. Although SCBs in the PSs are reported to be making profits, the \nextremely high level of impaired assets and the high proportion of loans classified in the doubtful \nand loss categories raises questions as to their profitability and solvency of the SCBs, especially \nin Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh, as well as the remaining SCBs if \nnorms at par with commercial banks are applied. The high level of impaired assets mainly reflects \nthe adverse impact of nonperforming loans in the lower CCS tiers on the system as a whole.  \n2.  The District Central Cooperative Banks  \n7.  Similar to the SCBs, the DCCBs are owned by member PACSs and the Government, and \nthe latter usually appoint the administrator of the DCCB. Compared with the SCBs, the market \nshare of the DCCBs at the district level is more substantial especially in the credit segment \nranging from 10\u201322%. The DCCBs\u2019 share in the district deposit market is low and more than 50% \nof the DCCBs (except for Maharashtra) reported loan-to-deposit ratios exceeding 100% in 2005. \nThe high dependency on SCB and NABARD resources reflects that many DCCBs are not seen \nas creditworthy, and that commercial banks may be more responsive to depositors\u2019 needs. \nTable A6.6: District Central Cooperative Banks \u2013 Key Financial Indicators  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \n                                                                                                                                                                   in Rs billion \n  India  Andhra    Maha-  Madhya     \nItem    Pradesh  Gujarat  rashtra  Pradesh  Orissa  Rajasthan \nTotal Assets  1,259.6  90.5  90.6  333.0  65.0  31.6  41.1 \nLoans  671.5  70.0  48.3  173.6  47.8  23.5  27.8 \nDeposits  791.5  24.7  64.9  248.2  39.2  18.3  22.7 \nBorrowings  202.1  46.9  13.6  23.6  12.4  10.8  13.1 \nEquity and Reserves  263.3  18.9  12.1  61.2  13.4  2.5  5.3 \nLoss making DCCBs (%)  \u2014  5  22.0  32  37  6  4 \nLoans to Deposits (%)  85  284  78  66  96  130  125 \n% of Districts Exceeding l/d of 1/1 (%)  \u2014  100  56  29  79  82  70 \nMarket Share Deposits (%)  \u2014  2  6  6  4  6  5 \nMarket Share Loans (%)  \u2014  10  10  22  12  11  2 \nImpaired Loans/Loans (%)  23  16  17  25  29  16  11 \nDoubtful and Loss Loans/Loans (%)  \u2014  6  12  14  13  10  4 \n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, l/d = loan to deposit. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n8.  NABARD reports a high number of loss making DCCBs, most of which are above 20% in \nthe PSs. NABARD\u2019s inspection and supervision in 2005 highlights the extremely poor collection of \ndues by DCCBs especially in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Orissa, where more than one-\nthird were unable to recover 60% of dues. The high proportion of impaired loans, which ranges \nfrom 16\u201329% of the aggregate DCCB loan portfolio, underscores the severity of the problem. The \npoor portfolio quality raises serious questions as to the liquidity, profitability, and solvency, which \nwould  be  largely  overstated  if  Reserve  Bank  of  India  asset  classification  and  accounting \nstandards are applied. DCCBs are currently unable to adequately underwrite and monitor loans at \nthe district and village levels, and the absence of automation and proper accounting and audit \nprocesses undermines the integrity and timeliness of management information. \n3.  The Primary Agricultural Credit Societies  \n9.  The PACSs constitute the grassroots tier of the CCS and typically have 1 to 2 staff. The \nstrength of PACSs lies in their closeness and accessibility to village clients, who would incur high \ntravel cost to access the branch network of the DCCBs. Since the CCS has so far largely \nfunctioned as state governments\u2019 supply system for agriculture credit, the PACSs\u2019 business is not \nlimited to financial services, but also includes services of input supply and marketing of crops. \n ", " Appendix 6       63 \nBecause of the absence of democratic structures for the management of PACSs, on-site controls \nand accountability through the board is essentially nonexistent. The lack of democratic ownership \nand responsibility has been compounded by political interference, lack of skills among PACSs \nstaff, and inadequate supervision by the DCCBs.  \n10.  Where reports exist, these usually point to extremely high levels of impaired assets. \nAlthough deposit mobilization is limited at the PACSs level, some PACSs mobilize significant \namounts  without  being  under  an  appropriate  regulatory  umbrella.  This  creates  significant \ncontingent liabilities for the state governments if the PACSs are unable to repay depositors. \nNABARD reports that almost 60% of all PACSs were unprofitable, and in Andhra Pradesh and \nOrissa about 80% of PACSs are reportedly loss making. In Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, \nvirtually no audit reporting exists that refers to the last 3 financial years. The absence of basic \nbusiness skills, systems, and controls at the PACSs level, and the high level of impaired loans \nhas led to an almost complete erosion of equity and deposits. As a result, a rigorous audit would \nlikely  result  in  most  PACSs  being  classified  as  insolvent.  It  is  critical  to  establish  simple \naccounting and audit frameworks, and conduct audits to establish a bottom line as to which \nPACSs could become viable and which should be closed or integrated into other local service \nstructures. Once audits are completed, it will be important to recruit and train staff to acquire the \nbasic skills to restore the remaining PACSs into functional entities.         \nTable A6.7: Primary

This  assessment  considers:  (i)  relevant  governance  issues  in  the  cooperative  credit \nstructure (CCS); (ii) relevant risk analysis of the CCS; (iii) controls for corruption at the sector \nand Program1 level; and (iv) recommendations on how the findings of the assessment can be \nincorporated into the design of the Program.  \n \n2.  Relevant Governance Issues in CCS. The Government of India (the Government) has \nput in place a reform package for the CCS. Governance and risk issues with respect to the \nproposed  reforms  can  be  considered  along  the  following  lines:  (i)  legal  dimensions,  (ii) \ninstitutional/political dimensions, and (iii) issue of simultaneity and phasing. \n \n3.  Legal Dimensions. The Cooperative Societies Act (CSA), 1912, is the core legal basis \nfor the CCS. Given its inadequacies, the CCS reforms require major amendments in the state \nspecific  CSAs.  Since  this  is  likely  to  take  some  time,  it  has  been  proposed  that  state \ngovernments  in  the  meantime  issue  administrative  measures  to  put  the  provisions  of  the \nproposed amendments into effect. Other relevant laws in this area are: the Banking Regulation \nAct  (BR  Act),  1949;  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  Act,  1982; \nCompanies  (Amendment)  Act,  2001;  and  the  Deposit  Insurance  and  Credit  Guarantee \nCorporation Act, 1961. While the BR Act gives the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) powers to \nregulate all banks, state governments need to amend CSAs to enable the RBI to exercise its \nregulatory powers under the BR Act directly. The regulatory enforcement of CCS remains weak \nsince the state governments\u2014through their office of Registrar of Cooperative Societies\u2014tend to \ndilute or delay RBI recommendations. \n \n4.  Institutional and Political Dimensions. The institutional and functional complexity of \nCCS is one of the reasons for the weak governance of the base level primary agricultural credit \nsocieties (PACS). The sheer number of PACSs (105,735), along with very little credible data, \nmakes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect issues in time for corrective actions. There \nis also weak capability in the sector.  \n \n5.  Issue of Simultaneity and Phasing. The issue of sequencing reforms is critical. The \nrelease of funds for cleaning the balance sheets would have to await a special audit and release \nof committed liabilities of governments. Also, the costs of reforms will most likely not be near-\nsimilar for the selected states. As such, the incentive to engage in reforms will be disparate, \neventually militating against rapid reforms of the sector throughout India.  \n \nA.  Risks, their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n6.  Underlying Assumptions. The main assumptions in the risk analysis are: (i) that the \nGovernment will stay the course in its objective of CCS reforms, and political commitment to \nattain it; (ii) that the legal reforms sought will materialize and be sustained in the immediate \nfuture; (iii) that effective institution building in key agencies will continue; and (iv) that state \ngovernments will support the proposed CCS reforms. \n \n7.  Risk Specification. The potential risks can be grouped into several categories: \n \n(i)  Political risks include, e.g., Government\u2019s commitment to reforms dwindles, state \ngovernments continue to politicize operations in CCS, and there is a political \nbacklash pursuant to closure of unviable CCS institutions. \n(ii)  Legal risks include, among others, failing to legislate to limit the role of state \ngovernments in CCS, and delays in institutionalizing legal arrangements. \n                                                 \n1 Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program. \n ", "Appendix 10  69 \n(iii)  Design risks include, among others, delays in special audits, inadequate financial \nassistance, and inappropriate sequencing of actions. \n(iv)  Finally,  implementation  risks,  of  which  there  are  many,  include  delays  in \nimplementing common accounting systems and rules for accounting, disclosure, \netc.; delays in and/or weak guidelines on internal audit procedures; proliferation in \nadjustment costs; high transaction/compliance costs of regulation; low level of \ncapacity; and continued risk of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement in CCS. \n \n8.  Risk Severity. Figure A10 shows the degree of severity of these and other risks.2 Type I \nrisks are the most severe, followed by Types II and III.  While there are no Type IV risks, there \nare several that can be categorized as Types I and II.  \nFigure A10: Risk Severity Matrix \n  Impact  \n    5  4  3  2  1 \n    Very High  High  Moderate  Low  Very Low\n5  Very likely    Type I  Type II    Type III \n  \u2022 Capacity   \nconstraints in all \ncooperative credit \nstructure (CCS) \ninstitutions \n4  Likely  \u2022 Politicization of  \u2022 Weak legal and  \u2022 Training targets only     \nCCS   regulatory  senior levels in \n\u2022 No full fund flow  infrastructure   institutions \nmanagement  \u2022 Delays in \ng   \u2022 Risk of fraud and   strengthening \nn\nri mismanagement   corporate \nur \u2022 Political backlash  governance \nc\nc from closures of  norms \no\nt  CCS \nn\nve 3  Moderately \u2022 Special audits  \u2022 Inappropriate  \u2022 State governments  \u2022 Government  Type IV \nf e likely  delayed  program  unwilling/unable to cede  commitment \nd o \u2022 Weak guidelines  sequencing and/or  powers   to reforms \no on internal audit  simultaneity of  \u2022 Delays in adopting  derails \no\nh procedures  reforms  common accounting  \u2022 States fail to \neli \u2022 Delays in winding  \u2022 States fail to make  systems  amend \nk\nLi up unviable CCS  adequate budget  \u2022 Weak business and  Cooperative \n\u2022 High adjustment  provisions  financial plans at CCS  Societies Acts \ncosts of closures    institutions  to limit their \n\u2022 Weak implementation  role in internal \nmonitoring framework  management \n\u2022 High transaction and/or  of CCS \ncompliance costs of \nregulation \n        \u2022 Weak program     \nperformance monitoring \nand evaluation  \n2  Unlikely      \u2022 Program not replicable      \n1  Rare           \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n                                                 \n2  The degree of severity is calculated by the product of the range of likelihood of the risk occurring and the potential \nimpact of such a risk. \n ", "70  Appendix 10 \n9.

Controls for Corruption at the Sector and Program Level \n \n10.  Corruption and mismanagement problems in the CCS are tied to the problem of heavy-\nhandedness of the state governments in its activities, which, in turn, is related to the ownership \nstructure. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, tries to address the issue of corruption in \ngeneral. Additional steps to fight mismanagement are strengthened audit systems, rigorous \nmonitoring systems, transparent loan appraisals, and integrated mechanisms for grassroots civil \nsociety organizations to monitor Program results during implementation. \n \nC.  Recommendations \n \n11.  To enhance the design and implementation of the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring \nand Development Program, it is recommended to: \n \n(i)  incorporate good governance and anticorruption provisions in loan assurances; \n(ii)  get  stakeholder  concurrence  of  governance  and  corruption  risk  mitigation \nstrategies; \n(iii)  acquire information during review missions on: revised structures and processes \nwithin CCS to assess progress in managing governance and corruption risks; and \nreview of incidences of mismanagement and inefficiencies in the CCS in the \nparticipating states; and \n(iv)  revisit  the  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessment  at  a  suitable \nopportunity in the Program period to assess how conditions may have been more \n(or less) favorable for effective implementation. \n ", "Appendix 11  71 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nEconomic and Agricultural Growth. While India\u2019s overall gross domestic product growth has been robust in recent \nyears and is projected to remain in the 7\u20138% range during 2007\u20132009, it has not been particularly broad-based or \ninclusive. Of particular concern is the poor performance of agriculture, which shows an average growth rate of just \n1.3% over the past 3 years\u2014against a Tenth Plan target of 4%\u2014and appears to be on a long-term decline. \nEmployment growth has also declined, mainly due to low rural growth, causing a sharp increase in absolute \nunemployment (from 20 million in 1993\u20131994 to 27 million in 1999\u20132000). Nearly two-thirds of the rural labor force is \nemployed in a sector that produces less than one-fifth of gross domestic product and where productivity has been \ndeclining. Low productivity growth depresses employment and wages in agriculture. Low wages and abundant labor \nlimit incentives for capital investments, which, in turn, restrains productivity growth. The midterm appraisal of the \nTenth Plan indicates that while some progress has been made in social indicators (such as education and health) \nover time, there are disturbing gender gaps, large rural-urban differences, and wide variations across states despite \nsteady growth over the last decade. This, in turn, jeopardizes achievement of the Millennium Development Goal \ntargets within the stipulated time. Disparities in economic and social development across regions and among different \nsegments of society are widening. According to the Planning Commission\u2019s approach to the 11th Five-Year Plan, the \ndeceleration in agricultural growth is the root of the rural distress that has surfaced in many parts of the country. \n \nAgriculture and Rural Poverty. India still has widespread poverty, with 75% of its poor living in rural areas. The vast \nmajority of the rural poor are engaged in agriculture, either as agricultural wage laborers, marginal farmers, or self-\nemployed workers. Almost 42% of the rural poor fall into the most economically disadvantaged group of agricultural \nlabor;  another  32%  are  self-employed  households  primarily  working  in  agriculture.  Nearly  42%  of  rural  poor \nhouseholds are landless, over 80% cultivate less than 1 hectare of land, and 74% are engaged as agricultural labor \nor in activities indirectly related to agriculture. This indicates limited opportunity for the poor in other sectors and high \ndependence on agriculture for livelihoods, despite low wages and unemployment. Poverty is an upshot of low \nincomes and unemployment, especially in rural areas: landless and marginal farmers mostly rely on some form of \nwage employment as a principal means of livelihood. But agricultural wage work is available only for about 60 days a \nyear while casual (construction) wage work is available for about 150 days a year. Agricultural wages vary from  \nRs20\u201340 per day. In many locations there has been a steady decline in village employment opportunities over the \nlast few decades due to the increasing population pressure and weak labor demand, which exerts downward \npressure on wages. Availability of work is seasonal (cultivation and harvesting). Total earnings regularly fall short of \nthe minimum to meet basic needs and laborers perpetually need credit from employers. Government employment \nprograms provide some relief, but fall well short of what is needed. The constraint is not only to find steady work \nthroughout the year, but also to obtain fair wages. Wage rates are usually below the minimum level. There is, in \naddition, widespread gender discrimination, with wages for women well below those for men for the same work. \nSmall farmers lack bargaining power to get a fair return from agriculture; markets are controlled by intermediaries, \nwho exploit the farmers; and lack of formal financial services results in heavy reliance on village money lenders, who \ncharge very high interest rates. Without savings and financial assets to protect them from shocks (natural calamities \nand price volatility), farmers have little incentive to invest in new technologies and diversify their production.  \n \nAgriculture and Rural Finance. Current government plans identify lack of credit as one of the causes for the \ndecelerating growth in agriculture. At a broader level, inadequate access to sustainable rural finance services \nconstrains rural growth and employment. This is confirmed by the poor who identify lack of access to affordable credit \nas a major hurdle in improving their household income. In large part, this reflects the collapse of the cooperative \ncredit structure (CCS). Other formal finance institutions are often reluctant to lend down-market to serve the needs of \nthe lower segment of the rural population. As a result, the rural poor rely on informal sources of finance, including \nprivate moneylenders. Lending interest rates for such transactions are anywhere from 25% to 360% per year. Not \nonly is this credit expensive, but also insufficient to start a small rural enterprise. Furthermore, lack of risk mitigating \nmeasures against natural disasters and volatility of agricultural prices further accentuate the vulnerability, particularly, \nfor small and marginal farmers.  Farmers might not obtain the returns to repay loan principal, which leads to fresh \nloans with some additional credit for the start of the new agricultural season. In addition, the conventional form of \nlending through mortgaging of land is becoming more common: moneylenders insist on sale of land with a verbal \npromise that it will be sold back to the debtor following repayment. With moneylenders also being traders, there is \ninterlocking of input, credit, land, and output markets that trap small and marginal farmers in a spiral of massive \ndebts. \n ", "72  Appendix 11 \nFarmer Suicides. Spate of suicides by farmers in recent years characterize India\u2019s agrarian crisis, particularly in the \nstates of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. The phenomenon is ongoing, and no longer limited to drought \nand poverty stricken areas, but is spreading to more productive agricultural regions as farmers seek to escape \nmounting indebtedness. Furthermore, the suicides occur both among large landholders and the landless and across \nall caste groups. In many cases, the suicides are linked to the failure of new seeds to deliver expected output, \ninability to meet the rising costs of production, and collapse of market prices. Farmers do not have the ability to bear \ndownside risks. The link between indebtedness and suicide has been highlighted by studies undertaken by the Tata \nInstitute of Social Sciences (2005) and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (2006) based on \nextensive survey in the state of Maharashtra. Both the studies identify interlinked and co-existing socioeconomic \nstressors as key causes for suicides: (i) indebtedness (87%), (ii) deterioration of economic status (74%), (iii) crop \nfailure (41%), and (iv) decline in social status (36%). However, suicides are just one of the several indicators of \ndistress: children are dropping out of school, widowhood is proliferating, and cattle and other \u201cassets\u201d of the poor are \nbeing sold off. Addressing these require not only short-term relief, but also long-term measures to rehabilitate the \nentire agrarian system, of which the CCS is a critical part. \n \nCooperative Credit Structure. With a large membership base, the CCS has inherent advantages in tackling the \nproblems of rural poverty and unemployment, through delivery of rural finance services in areas where both the \npublic and the private sectors have failed. However, in some states, CCS has very little stakeholder participation in \nmanagement. There have been no elections for years, and the CCS now largely operates as government entities. \nThe politicization of the CCS\u2014a consequence of the state government interference\u2014is preventing them from \nfunctioning as autonomous member-centric and member-governed institutions. The inadequacy of the CCS not only \nprevents it from effectively reducing rural poverty, but is also contributing to the increasing rural inequality, as rural \npoor have very little if any alternative sources of affordable rural finance services. Restoring control of the CCS to the \nmembers within an appropriate governance and transparency framework will bring major improvements to the rural \nsociety.  Through  the  delivery  of  sustainable  rural  finance  services,  the  proposed  Rural  Cooperative  Credit \nRestructuring and Development Program (the Program) will (i) facilitate better access to productive resources, such \nas  farm  inputs  and  improved  technologies;  (ii)  allow  higher  returns  from  farming;  (iii)  increase  employment \nopportunities for the landless; (iv) allow greater responsiveness to emerging rural nonfarm enterprise opportunities; \nand (v) increase accumulation of financial assets and, therefore, improved risk management. Improved access to \nrural finance services will, therefore, help inclusive rural development through enhanced income and employment \ngrowth. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nOver the last decade, India grew rapidly and the percentage of people below the poverty line declined. While the \noverall poverty rate declined, the extent of poverty reduction is debatable. Although some estimates indicate that \npoverty declined from about 36% in fiscal year 1993 to around 26% in fiscal year 1999, other estimates differ \ndepending on the model used to adjust for comparability. Various estimates range between 4.2 and 10.3 percentage \npoints for rural areas and between 5.8 and 8.8 percentage points for urban areas. Data from a new National Sample \nSurvey Organization is being processed and detailed results will be available in 2007. There is consensus however, \nthat the proportion of the population under the poverty line is declining at a modest pace, but large parts of the \npopulation are yet to experience a decisive improvement in living standards.  \n \nThe Government and the Asian Development Bank jointly undertook participatory poverty assessments over the past \n5 years encompassing 842 locations in 78 districts spread over seven states at various stages of economic and \nsocial  development.  The  study  covered  rural  and  urban  areas,  mixed  and  separate  gender  groups,  various \ncategories of the poor, and a range of stakeholders. The poor expressed lack of accessible credit as a major hurdle \nin improving their livelihoods. Assured and accessible institutional credit facilities were considered by the poor as \nessential to create sustainable employment opportunities. The Program includes a baseline socioeconomic survey \nand assessment of CCS reform implementation before the release of the second and the third tranches of the \nProgram. The baseline survey will collect the following information on rural households: demographic structure and \neconomic activities; food security and vulnerability; housing indicators; land ownership; and ownership of other \nassets. The poverty analysis will focus on: (i) poverty mapping and assessment of the rural poor who are unable to \naccess rural finance services; (ii) stocktaking of productive assets and skills of the rural poor, including financial \nliteracy to determine the intervention areas for rural finance outreach; (iii) identifying any social, political, and cultural \nconstraints for the rural poor in accessing rural finance services; and (iv) assessing the rural finance service delivery \noptions and social intermediation support to maximize investment returns and impacts, including for poor rural \nwomen.  \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11  73 \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe project preparatory technical assistance conducted various levels of participatory stakeholder analysis. \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe Program aims to transform the CCS into genuine member-owned entities. Internally, this implies that CCS will be \ndriven by the needs and priorities of members. The reformed CCS will provide a forum for discussion of local issues, \nmobilize local resources, build up bargaining and claim-making power of local communities to widen the options for \nincome-generating activities, and enhance local control over factors of production. Improved access to rural finance \nservices through the CCS will bring the rural poor into the economic mainstream. Furthermore, the Program will \nsupport social intermediation to empower the rural poor, including rural women, for effective access to rural finance \nservices. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn the last quarter of the century, Indian women have significantly improved their overall well-being. Yet women in \nIndia remain one of the most disadvantaged groups in society. The women to men ratio rose marginally during \n1991/2001 (933), after dropping for almost an entire century (944 in 1901 to 927 in 1991). India accounts for about \none-fourth of all maternity-related deaths in the world. Over 90% of rural women workers are unskilled and about \n90% are engaged in the informal/unorganized sector. Wage rates in agriculture for women are, on average, 30\u201350% \nless than for men. Women casual laborers in rural India show the highest incidence of poverty of any occupational \ncategory. Rural women have very limited access to formal and affordable rural finance services. Although close to a \nfifth of all rural households in India are female-headed, few women hold titles to land. Even in land-owning \nhouseholds, they do most of the work on the farm, but are not seen as farmers. Women account for 90% of those \nengaged in transplantation. They also make up 76% of those sowing seeds and 82% of people transporting crops \nfrom field to home. They are a third of the work force that prepares the land for cultivation, and between 70 and 90% \nof those involved in dairy.  \nAs employment and wages decline in rural areas, many families migrate to towns. Men seek work as auto drivers or \ndaily wage laborers, often without success. In such situations women have to bring up the children and manage the \nfarms. In addition, drunkenness of farmers and domestic violence are on the rise. These have led to a rise in the \nincidence of suicides among women. In a single year from August 2001 to July 2002, there were 311 recorded cases \nof women suicides in just one district. Close to 80% of these 311 women were from villages and most of the women \nhad a farm background.  \nConsidering the importance of financial services in rural areas and the low outreach of formal financial institutions, \nnongovernment organizations (NGO) have begun to examine alternative ways to enhance access to credit by the \nrural poor since the mid-1970s. In 1992, a pilot program of establishing and linking self-help-groups (SHG) of the \npoor with the banking system was launched by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).  \nThe program started with only 500 SHGs all over India in 1992 and has now expanded to 1.6 million SHGs in 2004. \nThese SHGs reached nearly 24 million borrowers, of which 90% are poor rural women. At present, there are three \ngroups of SHGs with different forms of linkages: (i) SHGs formed and financed by banks (20%), (ii) SHGs formed by \nother formal agencies (such as district central cooperative banks [DCCB]) but financed by banks (72%), and (iii) \nSHGs financed by banks using NGOs and other agencies (8%).  \nA typical SHG consists of 10 to 20 women, most from the same village, often from the same community and \neconomic status. They pool their monthly savings and rotate it as a personal consumption loan for 6 months to a year \nuntil they become eligible for a grant/loan from a local NGO or a government program or even a nonbank finance \ncompany. Female borrowers may undertake some farm-based activity by taking a loan for some sort of family \nenterprise or to meet emergency consumption needs. Women, in effect, become the conduit through which the family \nis able to access some credit, though recent suicides indicate that men still take the majority of loans that involve \nmortgaging the land or the house or other family assets. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nNABARD seeks to remove the barriers to credit for women. It aims to identify appropriate economic activities for \nwomen and promote women SHGs and link them with the formal banking system. NABARD has played an important \nrole in promoting SHGs in the form of grants, loans, and revolving fund assistance to NGOs. Exclusive schemes for  \nwomen  have   been   implemented such as (i) Assistance to Rural Women in Nonfarm Development, which \nenvisages that women\u2019s groups organized or  sponsored  by   a  suitable   agency  would  avail  of  bank credit,  not \nexceeding  Rs50,000 per member,  for  an own account activity or group activity, with 100% refinance support from \nNABARD; and (ii) assistance for Marketing of Nonfarm Products of Rural Women that  seeks to create a `niche' or \n`pro-women' market and assists in credit by way of 100% refinance up to Rs1 million. \n \n ", "74  Appendix 11 \nTo facilitate focused and strategic interventions for enhancing access to formal credit for rural women, a scheme for \nsupporting the establishment of Women Development Cells (WDC) in regional rural banks and DCCBs  was \nintroduced in 1995. NABARD has supported 100 such cells with grants of Rs2 million. Guidelines to set up WDCs in \nall banks to strengthen credit delivery to women and to provide credit plus services to them have been developed. \nNABARD has modified the scheme to extend support to WDCs set up by regional rural banks and DCCBs as an \nincentive. The incentives include 100% refinance to cover credit given to women; grant assistance for gender \nresponsive management information system for collection and maintenance of gender disaggregated data; mobility \nallowances  for  identified  officers  of  the  WDC  for  facilitating  activities  like  awareness  creation,  credit  camps, \ncounseling, and training, which will help in increasing the credit flow to women; costs of gender sensitization \nprograms and other gender related programs for capacity building of bank staff; promotional assistance costs for \naddressing the capacity building of women entrepreneurs; and costs toward awareness creation and publicity \ncampaigns for women relating to banking aspects. This also includes the cost of publicity literature to reach women. \n \nRestoring control of the CCS to the members and reforming the CCS financially and institutionally is expected to \nsignificantly enhance rural financial intermediation. This will enable greater outreach, including to rural women. The \nongoing schemes for women and the changing attitude of the banks towards female borrowers will further facilitate \naccess to credit for women. \nE.
