An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  reforms \nwas  undertaken  and  no  potential  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected.  \n \nWhile  overall  gross  domestic  product  growth  has  been  robust  in \nrecent  years,  it  has  not  been  broad-based  or  inclusive.  Of \nparticular  concern  in  this  regard  is  the  poor  performance  of \nagriculture, which has been on a long-term declining growth trend. \nWith  about  two-thirds  of  the  population  deriving  their  livelihood \nfrom  agriculture  and  nearly  three  quarters  of  the  poor  (or  nearly \n200  million)  living  in  rural  areas,  the  impact  of  the  decline  in \nagricultural performance on the quality of life of the poor has been \nsevere.  The  plight  of  the  rural  poor  has  been  thrust  into  the \ninternational  spotlight  in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  suicides  by \nhighly indebted farmers and growing rural unrest in many areas. \n \nDevelopment  experience  has  confirmed  that  rapid,  broad-based, \nand labor-intensive economic growth is the best means to reduce \npoverty.  Broad-based  agricultural  growth  offers  enormous \nopportunities for reducing rural poverty by expanding on- and off-\nfarm  employment.  Public  policies,  therefore,  must  continue  to \nreduce  the  deterioration  in  the  rural-urban  terms  of  trade, \nstrengthen  social  and  economic  infrastructure  in  rural  areas,  and \nrevamp rural finance delivery systems.  \n \nWhile  finance  is  a  critical  input  for  strengthening  the  rural \neconomy  and  agricultural  production  base,  the  response  of  the \nformal  rural  finance  system  has  been  increasingly  inadequate. \nThe  rural  finance  paradigm  for  the  most  part  has  been  driven  by \ncredit  expansion \n-controlled \nfinancial  institutions,  particularly  within  the  CCS  comprising \nprimary  agricultural  credit  societies,  district  central  cooperative \nbanks  (DCCB),  and  state  cooperative  banks.  While  a  substantial \n\nthrough  government-owned  or \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nPolicy Framework and \nActions  \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n\nin \n\nimpaired \n\ntheir  say \n\nthat  have \n\nfrom  having \n\nnetwork  of  CCS  institutions  and  an  enhanced  supply  of  services \nwere  established  as  a  result,  the  CCS  has  neither  been  able  to \neffectively address the demand and supply gaps in rural finance, \nnor function as a sustainable financial intermediary. \n \nAlthough organized on the principles of self-governance and self-\nreliance, the CCS has fundamental policy, governance, legal, and \ninstitutional  problems \nits  solvency, \nsustainability, and efficiency. As a result, the intended objective of \nenhancing  rural  financial  intermediation,  especially  to  the  asset-\npoor  and  disadvantaged,  has  only  been  partially  realized.  The \nprevailing policy and legal environment for the CCS has increased \nthe  tolerance  for  poor  financial  and  operational  performance  and \nprevented  CCS  members \nthe \nmanagement of the CCS institutions.  \n \nRapid  rural  finance  outreach  for  poverty  reduction  and  improved \nliving  standards  can  be  significantly  facilitated  by  revitalizing  the \nCCS. CCS reform is critical to rural transformation because it has \nan  all  India membership  base  of  135  million  and  has  links to  the \nbroader cooperative movement comprising processing, marketing, \ninput  distribution,  dairy,  and  weaving.  Reforming  the  CCS  will \nprovide the institutional base for potentially significant changes in \nthe rural economic and sociopolitical landscape. Legal, regulatory, \ngovernance,  and  institutional  reforms  are  required  to  remove \nthese deep-seated obstacles to enable the CCS to provide more \nefficient and affordable financial services to the poor. \n \nThe goal of the Program is to develop a sustainable CCS and the \nobjective  is  to  help  the  Government  carry  out  its  CCS  reform \nagenda.  Its  impact  is  enhanced  income  and  employment  growth \nfor the rural poor, while its purpose is to improve rural households\u2019 \naccess  to  affordable  financial  services  through  an  efficient  CCS. \nThe  scope  is  comprehensive  CCS  reform  in  five  states  (from \namong  Andhra  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra, \nRajasthan,  Gujarat,  and  Orissa)  that  have  concurred  with  the \nreform  agenda.  The  estimated  adjustment  cost  of  implementing \nthe  Program  in  the  five  participating  states  (PS)  is  about  $1.43 \nbillion. \n\nThe  Program  has  three  components:  (i)  establishing  a  policy \nreform  and  implementation  framework;  (ii)  building  a  facilitating \nlegal, regulatory, and governance framework; and (iii) institutional \nreforms for sustainability.   \n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $1.0  billion  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nand  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate-based lending facility, including a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n\n\f \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nOn  behalf  of  the  Government  of  Germany,  the  German  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (KfW)  has  worked  with  ADB \nsince  2003  on  developing  the  CCS  reform  framework,  which  led \nthem  to  agree  to  jointly  support  the  Program  for  CCS  reform  in \nfive  PSs  with  ADB.  KfW  has  earmarked  at  least  \u20ac140  million  for \nsupporting  CCS  reform.  Of  this,  \u20ac10  million  will  be  reserved  for \ntechnical assistance (TA). KfW\u2019s cofinancing will be provided in a \nparallel financing arrangement.  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  released  in  four  tranches.  The  first \ntranche  ($250  million)  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness, \nthe  second  tranche  ($250  million)  within  12  months  of  the  first \ntranche,  the  third  tranche  ($300  million)  within  12  months  of  the \nsecond  tranche,  and  the  fourth  tranche  ($200  million)  within  12 \nmonths  of  the  third  tranche  subject  to  compliance  with  the \nconditions for their release. KfW\u2019s assistance will be synchronized \nwith  ADB.  The  first  disbursement  (indicatively,  \u20ac65  million)  is \nexpected in mid-2007 and will be based on KfW\u2019s assessment of \nthe  progress  of  Program  implementation.  Subsequent  tranche \nreleases will be in tandem with those of ADB. \n\nA TA grant from the Government of the United Kingdom, through \nthe  Department  for  International  Development,  in  the  amount  of \n$2.0 million is attached to the Program to (i) assist the setting up \nand  implementation  of  the  program  performance  monitoring \nthe  state-  and  district-level \nsystem,  (ii)  build  capacity  of \nimplementation  units,  (iii) \nto \ninnovative  schemes \nenhance  credit  outreach  to  poor  rural  women,  and  (iv)  assess \nimplementation progress. Consultant recruitment for the TA grant \nwill  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  \n\nintroduce \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of \nimports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, \nother than those in the list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nThe implementation mechanism has been designed on a modular \nbasis,  in  line  with  the  structure  of  the  reform  process  that \nstipulates  uniform  content  in  each  PS  within  the  overall  policy \nframework. The Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be \nthe executing department for the Program and the National Bank \nfor  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  release  ADB  and  KfW  loan  funds  to \nNABARD and will take overall responsibility for program financial \nmanagement  and  reporting.  NABARD  will  oversee  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  Program  and  disbursements  to  the  CCS. \n\nParallel Financing  \n\nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nProcurement  \n\n \nExecuting Department \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nBenefits  \n\nSocial and  \nEnvironmental Issues \n\n \n\nHigh-level coordination of the reform effort will be provided by the \nNational  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Committee,  which  for \nProgram purposes will be the steering committee. The state-level \nimplementation committees to be established in the PSs will serve \nas  state  steering  committees  and  coordinate  the  efforts  of  the \ndistrict-level implementation committees.  \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  will  be  used  to  meet \nthe costs associated with the reform agenda.  \n\nBecause  the  problems  in  the  CCS  impose  significant  social  and \neconomic  costs,  the  benefits  of  reform  are  potentially  large. \nEnhanced  access  by  rural  households  to  affordable  financial \nservices and related improvement in rural growth and employment \ncould  potentially  benefit  nearly  41  million  CCS  members  in  the \nPSs and about 160 million members of their households. \n \nFinancial  institutions  can  respond  to  growth  opportunities  only \nwhen  they  operate  in  a  favorable  policy  environment,  and  are \nappropriately  governed,  organized,  and  equipped.  Program \nreforms  will  provide  this  critical  link.  While  ensuring  prudent \nlending  and  investment  decisions  through  formal  regulation  of \nstate  cooperative  banks  and  DCCBs,  the  Program  will  also  help \nharmonize  and  strengthen  CCS \nregulation.  Nonprudential \noversight  and  independent  audits  of  the  vast  network  of  primary \nagricultural  credit  societies  through  the  DCCBs  will  provide  cost-\neffective  supervision  appropriate \nfinance \ninstitutions. \n \nAnchored  in  an  overall  strategy  of  inclusive  growth,  the  most \nsignificant social benefit of CCS reform is the start of a shift in the \nrural  economy  by  empowering  small  and  marginal  farmers  to \nmeaningfully  and  substantially  participate  in,  and  benefit  from, \ndevelopment.  The  recognition  of  the  CCS  as  a  central  institution \nfor  rural  transformation  allows  low-income  households  to  realize \nsignificant  social  capital  and  equity  gains  in  India\u2019s  hierarchical \nrural social context. Restoring control of the CCS to its members \nand  encouraging \ntransparency,  and \nimproved  governance, \noperational  performance  are  expected  to  bring  major  changes  to \nthe rural economic landscape.  \n\nfor  small \n\nrural \n\nAt  the  macro  level,  the  poverty  reduction  goal  is  supported \nthrough greater access to affordable and sustainable rural finance \nservices,  which  in  turn  will  facilitate  better  access  to  productive \nresources  (e.g.,  farm  inputs,  improved  technologies,  and  rural \ninfrastructure). This will increase rural household incomes through \n(i)  higher  returns  from  farming;  (ii)  greater  employment  of  the \nlandless; \nto  emerging  nonfarm \nresponsiveness \nenterprise  opportunities;  and  (iv)  increased  accumulation  of \nfinancial assets and, therefore, improved risk management at the \nhousehold level. \n\n(iii)  higher \n\n\f \n\nv \n\n \n\nAffordable rural finance will also help the rural poor to (i) start or \nexpand  productive  enterprises;  (ii)  shift  from  irregular,  low-paid \ndaily labor to more diversified employment sources; and (iii) plan \nfor  routine  expenses,  cope  with  sudden  external  shocks,  and \nbetter  cover  unanticipated  expenses.  These  trends  will  also  help \nintegrate  the  rural  poor  into  the  mainstream  economy,  and  build \nlonger  term  defense  mechanisms  against  poverty  at  household, \ngroup,  and  village  levels,  which  will  be  particularly  important  for \nwomen. \n \nThe poverty and social assessment identified no persons that will \nbe  negatively  affected  in  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples. The Program is category C in \nboth areas. \n \nCCS  reform  entails  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory, \ngovernance, and institutional issues exacerbated by longstanding \npolitical interference. At the macro level, the consensus as well as \nthe  progress  on  the  reform  agenda  is  driven  by  the  growing \nrecognition  by  stakeholders  of  the  significance  of  improving  rural \nliving  standards  where  most  people  live.  While  this  is  the  most \neffective measure to ensure sustained commitment at all levels for \nprogram  implementation,  achieving  the  expected  impacts  will \ndepend  on  several  assumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying \ndegrees of risk. \n \nDespite  the  Government\u2019s  positive  track  record  in  reforming  the \ncommercial  banks  and  regional  rural  banks,  there  are  risks  in \ndealing  with  the  CCS,  particularly  the  likelihood  that  state \ngovernments will waver in their commitment to reform. These risks \nare addressed in part by front loading the conditions relating to the \npolicy  reform,  upfront  legal  assurances,  and  phased  financial \nassistance. \n \nIntensive  efforts  to  harmonize  policies  that  affect  the  CCS \nunderscore \nthe  CCS  held  by \nfor \nthis  convergence, \nthe  PSs.  Maintaining \nGovernment  and \nparticularly on the part of the PSs, requires clear priorities as well \nas  deft  political  management  to  balance  the  urgent  need  for \nreform  with  the  need  to  maintain  social  stability,  especially  in \nresource-poor areas.  \n \nThe  Program  envisages \nthe \naccumulated  losses  upon  completion  of  the  special  audits  and \nprogress  on  legal  enactments  and  institutional  reforms.  This, \nnevertheless,  entails  a  moral-hazard  risk  that  PSs  and  recipient \nCCS institutions may not follow through on the subsequent reform \nand  institutional  restructuring  commitments,  or  may  even  renege \non  previous  reforms.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  state  governments \nwill  provide  their  own  financial  contributions  to  CCS  reform \nupfront,  and  will  thus  have  a  greater  interest  at  that  stage  in \n\nthe  different  paradigms \n\nfinancial  support \n\nfor  cleaning \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\fseeing the process continue to move forward. Moreover, many of \nthe reforms have to be legislated and would prove more difficult to \nreverse.  In  addition,  the  CCS  institutions  will  also  adhere  to \nprudential  regulations  and  be  subject  to  performance  ratings  as \nwell as mandatory inspections under the banking laws.  \n \nStaff  behavior  could  also  prove  resistant  to  reform,  thereby \nthwarting  the  expected  improvements  in  financial  performance. \nFactors that mitigate these risks include (i) upfront commitment on \nthe  governance  framework,  autonomy,  and  professionalization  of \nboards;  (ii)  redefinition  of  the  institutional  mission  and  vision;  (iii) \nreduction  of  cost  overheads;  and  (iv)  significant  investments  in \ninformation \nsystems  and  procedures  (e.g.,  accounting  and \nsystems), and human resources development. \n \nEfficient  management  of  the  reform  process  is  crucial  to  avoid \ndisruption  of  service  delivery  while  reducing  pervasive  rural \npoverty and farmer distress. Implementation risk will be minimized \nby  engaging  an \nreform \nindependent  agency \nimplementation.  NABARD  will  provide  the  skills  to  implement  the \nreforms  and  monitor  CCS  performance  as  well  as  support  the \nstate-level  CCS  reform  implementation  mechanisms.  NABARD \nalso  has  a  nationwide  presence  and  maintains  an  extensive \ndatabase on the CCS. \n\nto  assess \n\nvi \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  India  for  the  Rural  Cooperative  Credit  Restructuring  and  Development  Program  (the \nProgram), and (ii) proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for \nRural Cooperative Credit Structure Reform.  \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n \nGrowth  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  remained  robust  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  20051  at \n2. \nabout 8.4% owing to continued strong expansion of industrial output and services. While export \nperformance also remained strong because of high global commodity prices and the elimination \nof textile quotas, the external current account deficit widened to 1.3% of GDP due to higher oil \nprices.  Foreign  exchange  reserves,  nevertheless,  remained  healthy  at  about  $155  billion \nbecause  of  steady  increases  in  both  foreign  direct  and  portfolio  investment.  However,  the \nconsolidated  fiscal  deficit,  which  decreased  by  more  than  a  percentage  point  to  7.7%  in \nFY2005, continues to be a concern. Finally, inflation has remained moderate in the 4\u20135% range \nover the past year, but underlying pressures from buoyant domestic demand and higher energy \nprices are strong. \n \nWhile India\u2019s overall GDP growth has been very strong in recent years and is projected \n3. \nto  remain  in  the  7\u20138%  range  during  2007\u20132009,  it  has  not  been  broad-based  or  inclusive.  Of \nparticular concern is the poor performance of the agriculture sector. Agricultural growth appears \nto  be  on  a  long-term  declining  trend,  falling  from  an  annual  average  of  3.2%  in  1980\u20131992  to \n2.4%  in  1993\u20132003  and  1.3%  over  the  past  3  years  (against  a  10th  Five-Year  Plan  target \ncovering  FY2003\u2013FY2007  of  4%).2  The  deceleration  in  agricultural  growth  appears  to  be \ngeneral across crops and regions, but has been particularly pronounced in the green revolution \nstates  that  are  the  breadbasket  of  the  nation,3  and  reflects  a  broadly  based  deceleration  in \nproductivity growth. The low productivity of agriculture stems from a number of factors, including \n(i)  slow  progress  on  land  reform,  (ii)  inadequate  rural  finance  and  marketing  services  for  farm \nproduce, (iii) small landholdings that are subject to fragmentation, (iv) slow adoption of modern \nagricultural  practices  and  technologies,  and  (v)  inadequate  irrigation  infrastructure  resulting  in \nhigh dependence on rainfall (nearly 70% of the total net sown area is rain-fed agriculture). \n \n4. \nAlthough  agriculture  accounts  for  less  than  one  quarter  of  GDP,  its  importance  to  the \neconomic,  social,  and  political  fabric  goes  well beyond  its  contribution  to  national  output.  With \nabout  two-thirds  of  India\u2019s  people  deriving  their  livelihood  from  agriculture  and  nearly  three \nquarters of the poor (or nearly 200 million people) living in rural areas, the impact of the long-\nterm  decline  in  agricultural  performance  on  the  quality  of  life  of  India\u2019s poor  has  been  severe. \nFor  example,  India\u2019s  human  development  index  declined  to  127  out  of  177  countries  in  2005, \nand key social indicators have now fallen well behind the People\u2019s Republic of China and even \nthose  in  neighboring  countries.  Life  expectancy  in  India  is  7  years  less  than  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  and  11  years  less  than  in  Sri  Lanka,  while  mortality  for  children  under  5  is \nalmost three times the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s rate, almost six times Sri Lanka\u2019s rate, and \nis higher than that in Bangladesh and Nepal.4 \n\n                                                 \n1  FY2005 covers 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006. \n2  The long-term decline of agriculture is described in detail in World Bank. 2004. India: Re-energizing the Agricultural \n\nSector to Sustain Growth and Reduce Poverty. Washington DC. \n\n3   Particularly, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. \n4  United Nations. 2005. Human Development Report 2005. New York. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe Tenth Plan goal of reducing poverty incidence to 21% by 2007 from 26% in 2000 is, \n5. \ntherefore, unlikely to be realized,5 and vast inequalities still exist between rural and urban areas \nthat are reported to have widened in recent years. On the former, a soon-to-be-released report \nfrom  the  National  Sample  Survey  Organization  shows  that  poverty  declined  by  a  mere  0.74% \nduring the 11-year period ending in FY2004. On the latter, per capita expenditure in rural India \nis  now  less  than  half  that  of  urban  areas,  and  the  rural-urban  divide  is  estimated  to  have \nwidened significantly across a broad spectrum of social indicators. The plight of the rural poor \nhas been thrust into the international spotlight in recent years as a result of suicides by highly \nindebted farmers6 and growing rural unrest in many areas of the country.7  \n \n \n6. \nRapid  and  sustained  agricultural  growth  and  rural  development  continue  to  be  key \ndevelopment priorities of the Government. It intends to gradually dismantle repressive policies \nthat  have  hindered  the  rural  economy  and  perpetuated  social  inequities.  The  National \nAgricultural Policy, the Tenth Plan and its Midterm Assessment, and the Government\u2019s National \nCommon Minimum Program (NCMP),8 all accord high priority to raising agricultural productivity. \nThe  NCMP  has  identified  the  following  priority  areas:  (i)  increased  public  investment  in \nagricultural research and extension, rural infrastructure, and irrigation; (ii) expanded rural credit \navailability  with  improved  coverage  of  small  and  marginal  farmers;  (iii)  improved  agricultural \ntechnologies  for  dry-land  farming  in  arid  and  semi-arid  areas;  (iv)  more  effective  crop  and \nlivestock insurance schemes; and (v) liberalization of marketing controls that depress prices for \nfarmers. A high-powered committee also recently tabled a set of far-reaching proposals on rural \nland reform for the Government\u2019s consideration. In addition, a National Employment Guarantee \nProgram  and  the  Swarnajayanti  Gram  Swarozgar  Yojana  are  being  implemented  to  mitigate \nimmediate concerns on rural poverty.9  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n \nA.  \n \n7. \nDemographic  Features.  Nearly  three-fourths  of  the  population,  or  about  750  million \npeople  comprising  about  125  million  households,  live  in  rural  areas.  Of  the  nearly  120  million \nindividual farmholdings comprising 170 million hectares (ha),10 roughly 60% are less than 1 ha, \nwhile another 20% are only 1\u20132 ha. Classified as small farmers, these two groups who work on \n80%  of  farmholdings  cultivate  36%  of  the  cropped  area.  Overall,  nearly  two-thirds  of  the  rural \n\n                                                 \n5  Official poverty estimates are available only every 5 years. The last survey from which poverty results are available \nwas in 1999\u20132000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the incidence of $1-a-day poverty in 2003 \nwas 30.7%, and the absolute number of poor was 326 million; if the $2-a-day poverty line is used, these increase \nto 78.0% and 830 million, respectively. \n\n6  The key causes of farmer suicides include (i) indebtedness (87%), (ii) deterioration of economic status (74%), (iii) \ncrop failure (41%), and (iv) decline in social position (36%). There is also some evidence to suggest that small and \nmarginal farmers are more likely to commit suicide than larger farmers in the event of crop failures. Indira Gandhi \nInstitute of Development Research. 2006. Suicide of Farmers in Maharashtra. Delhi, unpublished. \n\n7  Rural unrest accompanied by violent incidents mostly targeting government establishments was reported in 170 of \ndistricts in India in 2005, mainly because of inadequate and inequitable growth leading to growing unemployment \nand underemployment among rural youth.  \n\n8  The National Common Minimum Program was adopted in May 2004 by the United Progressive Alliance that came \n\nto power earlier that year. \n\n9  Both  are  major  nationwide  programs.  The  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Program  aims  to  provide \nemployment for 100 days per year to all rural adults. Currently implemented in 200 districts, it will be extended to \nall 593 districts. The Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana is a holistic program that provides credit and subsidy-\nfinanced assets to groups of poor or self-help groups, and skills development and marketing support.  \n\n10 Farmers are classified as marginal (up to 1 hectare of landholding), small (1\u20132), semi-medium (2\u20134), medium (4\u2013\n10),  and  large  (10  and  above).  Farmers  include  owners,  owner-cum-tenants,  and  tenants.  About  one-third  of  the \noperational farms constitute tenant farmers, most of whom are poor. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\nworkforce  of  315  million  (60%  of  the  total  labor  force)  is  engaged  in  agriculture11  either  as \ncultivators  or  agricultural  laborers,  with  the  rest  of  the  rural  population  engaged  in  nonfarm \nactivities, including rural enterprises.  \n \nPolicy  Setting.  Despite  the  primacy  of  rural  growth  and  development  in  national \n8. \ndevelopment  plans,  the  overriding  agricultural  policy  focus  remains  on  food  self-sufficiency \nthrough  policies  of  price  supports,  procurement,  subsidized  inputs,  and  public  investments  in \ninfrastructure,  even  though  domestic  grain  production  has  been  more  than  enough  to  satisfy \nconsumption  needs  for  over  a  decade.  Direct  subsidies  covering  the  cost  of  price  supports, \ndistribution,  and  storage  of  wheat  and  rice  still  amount  to  about  5%  of  annual  government \nexpenditure.  Agricultural  product  markets  also  remain  heavily  regulated,  which  has  limited  the \nscope  of  private  sector  involvement  in  the  marketing,  transport,  and  storage  of  agricultural \ncommodities, particularly basic foodstuffs, and reduced incentives for farmers to diversify their \ncropping  patterns.  However,  changes  are  slowly  being  ushered  in  that  have  facilitated  greater \nprivate sector participation in agricultural marketing and trade.  \n \nEmerging Trends. The rural economy is gradually becoming more market-oriented and \n9. \ndiversified  as  conventional  agriculture  becomes  more  resource-intensive  with  higher  levels  of \npurchased  inputs.  It  is  also  gradually  shifting  toward  high-value  crops  as  well  as  allied \nagricultural  activities  (particularly  agro-processing)  and  rural  nonfarm  enterprises.  High-value \ncrops  and  greater  value  addition  in  agriculture  also  require  new  investments  in  farm  assets \n(such as farm machinery) and rural infrastructure (such as high-efficiency irrigation systems and \nstorage  facilities).  The  global  trend  toward  lower  trade  barriers  and  reduced  farm  support  in \ndeveloped  countries  has  helped  to  reorient  agriculture  toward  high-value  commodities  in \nresponse  to  newly  emerging  export  opportunities.  Increased  domestic  demand  for  high-value \nagricultural  products  and  processed  foods  driven  by  rapid  income  growth  in  urban  areas  also \nprovides  new  market  opportunities.  Initial  steps  to  loosen  the  tight  controls  on  agricultural \nmarketing are also helping to increase diversification and commercialization. \n \n10. \nComposition of Rural Finance System. India\u2019s mostly state-owned or-controlled retail \nrural finance system is one of the largest in the world. The formal supply sources comprise (i) \nover 47,000 rural and semi-urban branches of 98 commercial banks; (ii) 14,372 branches of 196 \nregional  rural  banks  (RRB),  and  (iii)  a  cooperative  credit  structure  (CCS)  comprising  separate \nstructures  for  short-  and  long-term  credit.  The  CCS  has  a  combined  network  of  51  state-level \nbanks,  1,133  district-level  banks  with  about  13,743  branches,  and  about  105,000  credit \nsocieties. The semi-formal sector includes about 800 microfinance institutions, often registered \nas  nonbank  finance  companies  or  cooperative  societies.  The  vast  informal  credit  system \ncomprises  traders,  moneylenders,  pawnbrokers,  rotating  savings  and  credit  associations, \nlandlords,  relatives,  and  friends.  The  National  Agricultural  Insurance  Company  and  numerous \ncommodity futures markets (CFM) are also integral to the rural finance system. The formal rural \nfinance sector is described in Appendix 1.  \n \n11. \nThe  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD),  the  apex  rural \nfinance agency, provides refinance, institutional development, and capacity building, especially \nfor  the  CCS,  RRBs,  and  microfinance  institutions  (Appendix  2).12  While  the  Reserve  Bank  of \nIndia  (RBI),  the  central  bank,  supervises  and  regulates  the  commercial  banking  system, \n\n                                                 \n11 Includes crop production and marketing, farm mechanization, land development, irrigation, livestock, and forestry. \n12  The Small Industries Development Bank of India and Rashtriya Mahila Kosh also provide equity and refinance to \n\nthe microfinance institutions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nNABARD, as a second-tier agency, supervises the CCS and RRBs on behalf of the RBI. State \ngovernments also exercise supervisory powers over the CCS.  \n \n12.  Market  Segments.  The  rural  finance  client  market  is  highly  stratified  and  may  be \nclassified into the following broad categories based on landholding and employment patterns: (i) \na  lower  segment  comprising  about  75%  of  the  rural  population,  including  small  and  marginal \nfarmers,  the  landless,  and  farm  and  nonfarm  laborers,  especially  those  with  transitory  or \nseasonal  employment;  (ii)  a  middle  segment  comprising  almost  20%  of  the  rural  population, \nconsisting mainly of farmers with medium-size land holdings, small traders, and input suppliers; \nand (iii) an upper segment, comprising about 5% of the rural population, including commercial \nfarmers, large plantations, larger rural enterprises, and agriculture produce wholesalers. \n \nDemand  Patterns.  Reflecting  the  stratified  rural  finance  market  as  well  as  emerging \n13. \ntrends, the demand for rural credit has become more diverse both in terms of the activities for \nwhich  credit  is  sought  as  well  as  the  type  and  duration  of  credit.  The  upper  market  segment \nseeks  high-end  financial  services  such  as  letters  of  credit,  export  guarantees,  long-term \ninvestment  capital,  and  commodity  futures  contracts.  The  middle  segment  requires  working \ncapital, cash credit, loans against pledges of produce, and medium- to long-term loans for crop \ncultivation, rural transport, and land development. The lower market segment requires credit for \nconsumption,  microenterprises,  crop  and  livestock  production,  and  investments  in  minor \nirrigation. The demand for savings is similarly diverse, with the lower segment primarily seeking \nsecurity  for  their  savings,  while  more  affluent  households  are  primarily  interested  in  obtaining \nthe  highest  investment  return.  With  India  now  also  receiving  large  remittances  ($22  billion  in \n2005), rural finance institutions (RFI)13 have a significant opportunity to tap this market. \n \n14. \nFormal  Rural  Finance.  The  formal  rural  finance  system  is  broadly  segregated  into \nfinancial services provided to farm and rural nonfarm households, a large number of which are \npoor.  Microfinance,  as  a  subset  of  rural  finance,  specifically  targets  the  poor  and  is  primarily \nvillage-based. At the aggregate level, there are roughly 94  million rural borrowers  against 300 \nmillion rural savers, including those who save at post offices. The outstanding rural credit at the \nend  of  FY2005  from  formal  sources  was  estimated  at  Rs4,542  billion  ($100  billion),  with  the \nrelative shares of the commercial banks accounting for 53.0%, the CCS for 38.5%, and RRBs \nfor  8.5%.14  The  interest  rate  on  rural  credit  ranges  from  10.0%  to  20.5%  per  annum  for \ncommercial banks, 7.0% to 15.5% for the CCS,15 and 10.0% to 20.5% for the RRBs. There are \n60 million rural borrowing clients with the CCS, compared to nearly 20 million loan accounts in \nthe  commercial  banks  and  6  million  in  the  RRBs.  Rural  savings  with  the  commercial  banks, \nCCS, and RRBs at the end of March 2005 were Rs6,742 billion ($147 billion). \n\n15.  With  rural  credit  collectively  comprising  only  about  26%  of  total  bank  credit,  there  is  a \nsignificant  supply\u2013demand  gap  despite  the  extensive  rural  finance  network.  With  more  than \n50%  of  the  CCS  in  various  stages  of  impairment,  the  135  million  members  reflect  potential \nrather  than  actual  outreach.  The  poorest  households  and  women,  in  particular,  have  little \naccess  to  formal  rural  finance  services  for  capital  formation  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  only \n20% of the lower segment is estimated to have access to the formal rural finance system. This \n\n                                                 \n13  In this document, unless otherwise specified, RFIs collectively denote commercial banks in rural areas, CCS (both \nshort- and long-term) entities, RRBs, and semiformal arrangements, including microfinance  institutions. The term \n\u201cmicrofinance\u201d  is  used  only  for  specific  microfinance-related  references.  Similarly,  wherever  relevant,  commercial \nbanks are specifically mentioned. \n\n14 In addition, the estimated $53 million loan portfolio of microfinance institutions comprises a million borrowers. \n15  The range of lending interest rates reflects the varying loan sizes for different purposes issued by different tiers of \nthe  CCS.  While  there  is  a  guideline  indicating  that  the  CCS  should  lend  at  7%,  this  is  generally  ignored  unless \nupfront compensation is provided by the Government to enable retail lending at this rate.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n \n\nlack  of  access  can  be  attributed  to  factors  such  as  their  inability  to  meet  the  creditworthiness \nstandards of the formal rural finance system (lack of stable incomes and collateral), as well as \nthe  unwillingness  of  financial  institutions  to  absorb  the  high  transaction  costs  associated  with \nsmall loans.  \n \n16. \nThe  range and  scale  of  services  offered  through  the  formal  rural  finance  sector  is also \noften  inadequate,  which  further  limits  the  activities  that  can  be  supported,  particularly  the \nproduction of higher value crops and increased value addition by small farmers. In addition, crop \ninsurance,  while  compulsory  for  small  farm  loans,  is  neither  actively  pursued  nor  adequately \nfunded, and thus does not sufficiently mitigate risks. The emergence of several multi-commodity \nfutures  exchanges  structured  in  line  with  international  best-practice  technology  has  been  a \nparticularly  important  recent  development,  but  trading  volumes  remain  lower  than  potential \ndespite rapid growth in recent years. In addition, the exchanges are not closely integrated with \nlocal  spot  markets,  which  limits  the  benefits  they  provide  in  terms  of  risk  hedging  and  price \ndiscovery for small farmers.  \n \nInformal Rural Finance. Even though formal RFIs are physically present in rural areas, \n17. \nsmall  farmers  are  unable  to  access  them  because  of  borrower-unfriendly  products  and \nprocedures,  and  high  transaction  costs.  The  lower  segment  of  the  rural  finance  market, \nparticularly the poorest of the poor, must therefore rely on the informal sources for their credit \nneeds.  The  informal  sector  comprises  a  diverse  range  of  actors,  including  a  tightly  linked \nnetwork  of  moneylenders,  input  suppliers,  rural  elites,  and  pawnbrokers.  Loans  from  informal \nsources  are  often  the  only  means  for  the  poor  to  raise  funds  for  small  investments,  life-cycle \nexpenses, and health emergencies as moneylenders generally do not impose restrictions on the \nuse of funds. However, few, if any, productive activities can absorb interest charges ranging up \nto 360% per year and still provide sufficient household income for subsistence.  \n \n18. \nAs a result of the recent spate of farmer suicides in parts of the country, high-debt levels \namong poor rural households, and other indications of socioeconomic stress, the Government \nhas started cracking down on village moneylenders by declaring their loans illegal and releasing \nfarmers  from  their  debts.  As  a  result,  input  dealers  have  geared  up  to  meet  the  credit  gap  by \nproviding farm inputs tied to the buyback of farm outputs. Their domination of local social and \neconomic relations enables the dealers to control input and output prices, which often traps poor \nhouseholds in a web of indebtedness and is a major determinant of pervasive rural poverty. The \nbargaining power of the informal suppliers is inversely correlated with the density and reach of \nthe formal rural finance sector and its willingness to meet the local demand for credit. \n \n19. \nSelf-Help  Groups  and  Outreach  to  Women.  Alternative  arrangements  for  enhancing \nrural finance outreach to the poor have been explored by nongovernment organizations (NGO) \nsince  the  mid-1970s.  In  the  early  stages,  NGOs  played  a  pivotal  role  in  implementing  and \ninnovating the self-help group (SHG) model. Based on the \u201cself-help\u201d concept, small groups of \n10 to 20 women are formed to operate businesses by using members\u2019 savings to fund loans. In \nthe 1980s, policymakers took notice and worked with development organizations and bankers to \npromote  these  savings  and  credit  groups.  Accordingly,  NABARD  initiated  a  pilot  program  in \n1992, the SHG Bank Linkage program, for establishing SHGs and linking them to RFIs. While \nNGOs  facilitate  the  formation  and  capacity  building  of  SHGs,  NABARD  provides  refinance  to \nRFIs  to  lend  to  SHGs.  The  program  has  expanded  dramatically  from  500  to  1.6  million  SHGs \nwith over 24 million borrowers, of whom 90% are poor rural women.  \n \n20. \nNABARD  has  also  supported  the  formation  of  women-only  SHGs  and  introduced \nexclusive  schemes  that  link  credit  to  poor  women  with  identification  of  appropriate  economic \nactivities such as (i) Assistance to Rural Women in Nonfarm Development, and (ii) Assistance \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nfor Marketing of Nonfarm Products of Rural Women. By providing grants since 1995, NABARD \nhas  supported  the  establishment  of  women  development  cells  in  RRBs  and  the  CCS  to \nstrengthen credit delivery and provide credit and services to women. The incentives for RFIs to \nparticipate  in  these  schemes  include  100%  refinance  support,  grants  to  develop  gender-\nresponsive information systems, and training programs to sensitize their staff to gender issues. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n \n21. \nThe  rural  finance  paradigm  for  the  most  part  has  been  driven  by  credit  expansion \nthrough  government-owned  or  controlled  RFIs.  While  a  substantial  network  of  RFIs  and  an \nenhanced supply of rural finance services have been established, the system has not been able \nto meet the diverse demand for services for the majority of rural households. The Government\u2019s \nrole in rural finance market development was intended to increase lending by reducing the cost \nand  risks  for  RFIs  lending  to  preferred  clients.  While  the  upper  segments  of  the  rural  finance \nmarket can access the rapidly modernizing urban and peri-urban financial markets through the \ncommercial  banks,  the  access  to  formal  credit  for  other  rural  residents,  particularly  the  poor, \nhave  not  improved  in  any  significant  manner.  The  investments  in  RFIs  have  thus  bypassed \nlarge parts of the market and neither rapid economic transformation nor equitable development \ncould take place. \n \n22. \nCooperative  Credit  Structure.  Established  in 1904  to  free  farmers  from  indebtedness \nand poverty, the CCS has evolved into one of the largest rural finance systems in the world, with \nabout 135  million members, of whom nearly 60 million are borrowers. The CCS is considered \nthe  binding  factor  for  the  broader  cooperative  movement  in  India,  which  includes  crop \nproduction, processing, marketing, input distribution, dairying, weaving, and textiles. The reach \nof  the  CCS  thus  directly  or  indirectly  extends  to  nearly  half  of  the  population  of  1  billion.  The \nCCS is also generally credited with facilitating the green revolution in India. With agriculture as \nthe main means of subsistence, the significance of the CCS in the country\u2019s political economy is \nimmense. The vast scale and achievements of  the CCS ensure government support but have \ninevitably led to poltical interference in its functioning.  \n \n23. \nStructure. The CCS for short-term credit has at its base the 105,735 primary agriculture \ncredit  societies  (PACS),16  dealing  mainly  in  credit.  The  PACSs  are  federated  into  368  district \ncentral  cooperative  banks  (DCCB),  which  in  turn  are  members  of  31  state  cooperative  banks \n(SCB).  For  the  long-term  credit  system,  there  are  20  state  cooperative  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment banks (SCARDB) with 887 branches and 768 primary cooperative agriculture and \nrural development banks (PCARDB), or retail branches federated with the SCARDBs. In some \nstates,  the  CCS  for  short-term  credit  has  no  DCCBs,  while  in  others,  the  CCS  for  short-term \ncredit also covers the long-term structure. The overall CCS structure is described in Appendix 1.  \n \n24. \nLegal  Framework.  As  cooperatives  are  a  state  subject  under  the  Constitution,  CCS \ninstitutions  are  registered  as  societies  under  state-specific  cooperatives  societies  acts  (CSA). \nSome  states  have  also  enacted  mutually  aided  cooperatives  societies  acts  (MACSA)  for \nregistering  cooperative  societies  that  transact  business  only  with  members,  have  no  state \ngovernment  contribution,  and  do  not  borrow  from  or  use  state  government  guarantees  for \nborrowing. In contrast, nonmembers have significant stakes in the CCS and state governments \nlargely  manage  them.  The  CCS  is  required  to  elect  board  members  and  lower  tiers  are \ngenerally majority owners of the next highest tier. Only borrowing members have voting rights. \n\n                                                 \n16  In addition, there are multi-purpose farmers\u2019 service societies with a larger area of operation compared to PACSs.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n\nThe  lower  tiers  for  the  most  part  have  to  borrow  from\u2014and  invest  in\u2014the  next  highest  tier. \nWhile PACSs and PCARDBs are exclusively retail entities, retail services are also provided by \nthe higher tiers.  \n \nOutreach. The total membership of the PACSs is about 120 million\u2014of whom 42% are \n25. \nsmall  and  marginal  farmers  and  37%  are  from  marginalized  social  groups\u2014with  51  million \nborrowing members. The total membership in the SCARDBs and PCARDBs is 15 million, with \nabout  9  million  borrowing  members.  The  CCS  accounts  for  one-third  of  rural  saving  and \nprovides  one-quarter  of  investment  credit  and  about  half  of  agriculture  production  credit,  thus \nmeeting  about  one-third  of  overall  agricultural  credit  needs.  It  also  provides  credit  for  fertilizer \nproduction,  input  marketing,  yarn  weaving  and  processing,  sugar  manufacturing,  and  milk \nproduction  and  processing.  In  states  such  as  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Gujarat, \nChattisgarh, and Haryana, the CCS provides more than 50% of the formal credit for agriculture. \nIn comparison, the commercial banks have about 20 million agricultural borrowers. The average \nrural  loan  size  of  the  commercial  banks  ($2,573)  and  CCS  ($633)  suggests  that  the  potential \noutreach of the CCS is much deeper than that of the commercial banks given the predominance \nof small farmers. \n\n26. \nImpairment.  While  the  CCS  is  organized  on  the  principle  of  self-governing  and  self-\nreliant organizations, its policy, governance, legal, and institutional framework adversely affects \nits solvency, sustainability, and efficiency. As a result, the intended objective of enhancing rural \nfinancial intermediation, especially to the asset-poor and disadvantaged, has only been partially \nrealized.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nLegal. Democratic functioning is the rationale for establishing cooperatives. The \nCSAs, however, allow the state governments to remove elected representatives \nfrom CCS boards, amalgamate or divide the CCS, and contribute to capital. This \nhas undermined the membership-based character and the CCS is largely run as \na  state-owned  entity.  To  retain  de  facto  state  control,  the  extant  CSAs,  in  most \ninstances, contain no provisions for CCS institutions to migrate to the MACSAs.  \n\nPoor  governance.  The  state  governments  have  been \nthe  dominant \nshareholders, managers, regulators, and concurrent supervisors and auditors of \nthe  CCS.  The  state  governments,  through  the  office  of  the  registrar  of \ncooperatives  under \nthe  CSAs,  supersede  elected  boards  and  appoint \nadministrators,  thus  assuming  powers  to  approve  staffing  patterns,  staff \nrecruitment,  emoluments,  asset  purchases,  and  business  and  pricing  decisions. \nChange in governments at state level is often followed by reconstituted boards of \nCCS institutions with a new set of government nominees and elections are either \ndelayed  or  do  not  take  place  at  all.  In  addition,  audits  are  delayed  and  their \nrecommendations not followed.17 There are no accounting codes for PACSs. \n\nReverse paradigm. The rural finance policy paradigm of the state governments \nthat  set  the  norms  and  incentives  for  the  CCS  impedes  viable  financial \nintermediation.  The  PACSs  and  PCARDBs  at  the  base  level  primarily  dispense \ncredit. Because of this, the upper tiers were created to ensure adequate supply \nof  financial  resources.  Credit  orientation  is  perpetuated  by  giving  voting  rights \nonly to borrowers. Excluding the majority (i.e., depositors) is a conflict of interest \nas borrowers dominate all business decisions, which undermines sustainability.  \n\n                                                 \n17  For instance, (i) no elections have been held in the CCS across all tiers for 10 years or more in three states; (ii) \nboards of 9 out of 31 SCBs, and 134 out of 368 DCCBs, have been superseded by the registrar of cooperatives; \nand (iii) audits have been pending in at least 15% of the PACSs for more than a year.    \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n  \n\n(v) \n\nRegulatory  forbearance.  SCBs  and  DCCBs  are  classified  as  banks  under  the \nBanking  Regulation  Act  of  1949  since  they  mobilize  public  savings.18  However, \nprudential  norms  cannot  be  effectively  enforced  since  the  CSA  empowers  the \nregistrar  of  cooperatives \nimplementation  of  RBI \nto  override  or  delay \nrecommendations.  Prevailing  prudential  norms  for  SCBs  and  DCCBs  are  not \ncomparable  to  commercial  banks.19  The  resulting  regulatory  arbitrage  and \nforbearance perpetuates poor governance and insolvency in the CCS. The status \nquo  allows  state  governments  to  disregard  their  obligations  to  the  CCS  and \nperiodically  declare  waivers  of  interest  and  principal  and  interfere  to  delay  or \ndilute loan repayments. These adversely affect credit discipline. \n\nPoor  portfolio  quality.  As  a \nresult  of  weak  portfolio  management, \nnonperforming assets have shown an increasing trend in absolute terms as well \nas  a  proportion  of  the  loan  portfolio.20  For  the  short-term  CCS,  nonperforming \nassets were 36% of outstanding loans on 31 March 2004. Overall, nearly 75% of \nthe  CCS  institutions  have  loan  repayment  rates21  of  less  than  60%.22  Portfolios \nremain vulnerable since three-fourths of CCS credit is for crop loans.  \n\n \n(vi) \n\nRecurring  losses.  Poor  portfolio  performance  translates  into  systemic  losses. \nFive  SCBs,  more  than  28%  of  DCCBs,  and  49%  of  PACSs  reported  losses  in \nFY2004.23 In addition, 47% of SCARDBs and 63% of PCARDBs incurred losses. \nEight out of 31 SCBs and 144 out of 368 DCCBs have eroded their net worth.  \n\n \n(vii)  Deposit erosion. Of the $32 billion of deposits with the CCS, nearly 56% is from \nthe public (i.e., other than members of the CCS), with the rest from institutions. \nSCBs and DCCBs are required to protect individual depositors with a cover of up \nto  $2,145  by  the  Deposit  Insurance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Corporation  of  India. \nHowever, deposits of lower tiers with higher tiers (PACSs to DCCBs and DCCBs \nto  SCBs)  are  treated  as  institutional  deposits  and  hence  are  not  eligible  for \ncoverage.  The  magnitude  of  risk  is  compounded  since  losses  in  SCBs  and \nDCCBs have eroded nearly $1 billion of deposits over and above the erosion of \ntheir net worth.24 A good proportion of savings mobilized by PACSs ($4 billion) is \nfrom nonmembers even though they are not permitted to accept public deposits \nand despite their precarious financial position. \n\n(viii)  Competitive disadvantage. CCS borrowers have to subscribe to share capital. \nSince  the  CCS  is  unable  to  pay  dividends,  the  effective  cost  of  borrowing  may \nexceed the cost charged by commercial banks. However, this does not translate \ninto  higher  net  profits  because  the  CCS  pays  higher  interest  rates  on  deposits. \nTransaction and risk costs are also higher because of small loan sizes and high \nportfolio  concentration  in  agriculture.  As  a  result,  larger  borrowers  with  good \ncredit records tend to borrow from commercial banks and RRBs. \n\n                                                 \n18 The Banking Regulation Act does not govern the PACSs and the CCS for long-term credit given that neither are \n\nmandated to mobilize public savings (i.e., from non-members). \n\n19  The  SCBs  and  DCCBs  are,  however,  subject  to  submission  of  regular  returns  on  their  financial  status  and \n\noperations, compliance with which is weak. \n\n20  Nonperforming  assets  are  defined  differently  for  the  CCS\u2014they  cover  only  the  amount  of  default  from  the  lower \n\ntiers and not the entire outstanding amount in the defaulted account, which results in an understatement.  \n\n21 Repayment rate in this document refers to collection as percentage of loans due.  \n22  SCBs: 84% (nonperforming assets 18%); DCCBs: 62% (nonperforming assets 23%); and 62% for PACSs.  \n23  The  current  profits  or  losses  could  be  misleading,  especially  since  some  institutions  reporting  profits  could  have \n\nheavy accumulated losses and may also not be making required provisions.   \n\n24  Data on deposit erosion in the PACSs, however, are not available because of inadequate financial records. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nInstitutional  constraints.  The  CCS  has  made  inadequate  investments  in \nenhancing  systems  and  procedures,  products  and  services, \ninformation \ntechnology  platforms,  and  skills  development  of  staff.  Consequently,  the  lack  of \nstandardized  business  models  and  risk  mitigation  systems  and  procedures, \nincluding  for  asset  and  liability  management,  compound  CCS  management \nproblems.  Overstaffing  and  lack  of  professionalism  further  increase  overhead \nand  transaction  costs.  Weak  systems  and  procedures  also  result  in  fraud  and \nembezzlement either not being detected or not followed up. \n\nInappropriate incentives. NABARD refinance, which accounts for nearly 40% of \nthe  retail  lending  of  the  CCS,  is  perceived  as  a  government  commitment  to  the \nrural  sector  rather  than  as  a  financial  obligation  that  needs  to  be  managed \nprudently and repaid. The refinance is guaranteed by the state governments and \nrolled over perpetually.25 With continued deterioration in the financial position of \nthe CCS, dependence on NABARD refinance is growing. The CCS would largely \nbecome inoperative if NABARD were to recall its refinance.  \n\n \n\n(xi) \n\nInformation  asymmetry.  Ineffective  information  systems  to  screen  credit  risks \nadd  to  the  overall  transaction  costs  in  the  CCS.  The  absence  of  adequate \ninformation  often  leads  to  restricted  services  to  potential  clients,  particularly  the \npoor, where information gaps are most severe. \n\n \n27. \nThe  weaknesses  of  the  CCS  have  immense  adverse  economic,  social,  and  political \nimpacts  on  the  rural  sector.  In  particular,  they  accentuate  the  demand  and  supply  gap  and \nregional  disparities  in  rural  finance  service  delivery,  given  its  vast  network  and  membership \nbase.  As  the  major  institutional  provider  of  agriculture  production  credit,  the  deteriorating \nfinancial and institutional status of the CCS adversely affects the backward (inputs) and forward \n(marketing)  linkages  and  their  integration  with  the  multipurpose  service  concept  of  the \ncooperative  system.  Moreover,  lack  of  autonomy  and  poor  governance  have  allowed  political \ncontrol of the CCS, resulting in decisions being taken with impunity for political gains, including \nuncompensated  waivers  of  interest  and  principal.  The  CCS  institutions,  in  turn,  are  unable  to \noperate as \u201clocal\u201d institutions or meet the needs of their membership. \n \n28. \nOther  RFIs.  Other  RFIs  have  not  been  able to compensate  for  the  weaknesses  of  the \nCCS  and  fill  the  void  in  rural  financial  services.  Although  the  commercial  banks  have  been \nsystematically strengthened since 1991 and have registered the most impressive growth in rural \nsavings and credit, their orientation is toward larger loans and more populous areas. The high \ntransaction  costs  for  small  loans  adversely  affect  the  access  to  financial  services  from \ncommercial  banks  by  the  weaker  segments  of the  village level  rural  finance  market.26  Political \ninterference in the CCS also deters the commercial banks from expanding their rural portfolios. \nWhile  the  overall  performance  of  the  RRBs  is  improving  following  the  recapitalization  support \nprovided in 1995\u20131999, continued institutional strengthening will be required to consolidate their \nposition and significantly extend their outreach. \n \n29. \nThe  nonbank  RFIs  have  also  yet  to  extend  their  outreach  to  the  rural  poor  in  any \nsignificant  manner.  Although  the  CFMs  now  comprise  24  exchanges,  segmentation  by \ncommodity,  regional  dispersal,  and  separate  spot  and  forward  markets  have  impeded  more \nremunerative  prices  and  improved  marketing  efficiency  for  small  agricultural  producers. \n\n                                                 \n25  Without the state government guarantees on refinance to the CCS, NABARD\u2019s portfolio could be considered weak. \n26  These include small and marginal farmers, landless laborers, artisans, and service providers at the village level.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nindicates \n\nOpportunities  \n\nDevelopment  experience \n\nthat  rapid,  broad-based,  and \n\nAddressing  these  concerns  will  require  effective  market  regulation  and  stronger  downstream \nsystems for price discovery and integration of small farmers. The ongoing National Agricultural \nInsurance Scheme, which covers food crops, oilseeds, and selected commercial crops, has had \nonly a limited impact on reducing vulnerability of rural households as it only provides coverage \nto 18 million farmers (out of 120 million).  \n \n \n \nlabor-intensive \n30. \neconomic  growth  is  the  most  effective  means  to  reduce  poverty.  In  particular,  broad-based \nagricultural  growth  offers  enormous  opportunities  for  reducing  rural  poverty  by  expanding  on- \nand off-farm employment. To succeed, agriculture policies must continue to improve the rural\u2013\nurban terms of trade, strengthen social and economic infrastructure in rural areas, and find ways \nto spur timely completion of ongoing irrigation projects. At the same time, the efficiency of rural \nfinance  intermediation  and  access  of  the  poor  to  formal  credit  channels  must  also  improve  if \nrural  living  standards  are  to  be  enhanced.  Indeed,  there  is  growing  consensus,  based  on \ntheoretical and empirical work, that better access to affordable finance can be an extraordinarily \neffective tool for promoting inclusive growth. \n \nIndia has witnessed a visible shift in financial sector policies since the 1990s.27 The key \n31. \nactions that helped reshape India\u2019s financial system were: in banking (i) the gradual freeing of \ninterest rates, (ii) entry of private sector banks and easing of restriction on foreign banks, and \n(iii)  phasing  out  of  the  preferential  access  of  development  finance  institutions  to  funds;  and  in \nthe capital market (i) easing of controls, particularly with respect to the pricing of equity issues, \nand (ii) entry of foreign institutional investors. In conjunction with liberalization, measures were \ntaken to strengthen regulation and supervision, among others: in banking (i) phased compliance \nwith  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  Basel  Committee  recommendations  on  capital \nadequacy;  and  (ii)  tightening  of  prudential  norms  with  respect  to  income  recognition,  asset \nclassification,  and  provisioning.  More  recently,  the  passage  of  the  Securitization  and \nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interests Act has strengthened \nthe  capacity  of  the  banks  to  enforce  security  and  reduce  build  up  of  nonperforming  loans  but \npriority sector lending requirements continue on commercial banks.  \n \nThe  capital  market28  has  undergone  unprecedented  reform  and  has  been  transformed \n32. \nfrom  a  fragmented,  archaic,  inefficient,  and  highly  unregulated  market  into  an  integrated, \nmodern,  and  centrally  regulated  system  with  improved  depth  and  liquidity.  Liberalization \nmeasures  have  led  to  the  development  of  institutional  investment  and  growth  of  the  mutual \nfunds  industry  and  the  opening  up  of  the  insurance  industry.  The  Government  is  currently \nconsidering  major  proposals  for  reform  of  the  pension  funds  systems.  The  use  of  derivative \ninstruments has gained considerable ground. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has \nalso  been  strengthened  and  vested  with  the  required  authority  and  standards  have  been \nupgraded  to  conform  to  best  practices  in  many  respects.  A  sizeable  government  securities \nmarket has been in operation for quite some time.  \n \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 1992. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor  a  Financial  Sector  Program.  Manila  (Loan  1208-IND  for  $300  million,  approved  on  15  December  1992) \nsupported many of the reforms in the sector after the crisis. \n\n28  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program  Loan.  Manila  (Loan  1408-IND  for  $250  million,  approved  on  28 \nNovember 1995) supported the reform and modernization of the domestic capital market.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe reform measures have led to increased allocative efficiency of the financial system \n33. \nwith  greater  reliance  on  private  sector  participation  and  market  forces,  brought  about  by  a \nreduction  in  intermediation  costs,  enhanced  competition,  and  increased  diversity  of  products \nand services. While these reforms have been mainstreamed in the commercial banks and the \ncapital  market,  and  introduced  among  the  RRBs,  the  CCS  has  remained  at  the  periphery  of \nthese  reforms.  In  a  rapidly  modernizing  financial  sector,  the  CCS  has  come  under  greater \nscrutiny. The recurring financial drain in pursuit of the old rural finance paradigm and narrowing \nfiscal space in the states have also prompted a shift in strategy that now seeks to develop viable \nintermediaries  for  enhancing  rural  finance  outreach  and  development  impacts.  In  this  context, \nthe  Government  is  also  considering  enacting  legislation  conducive  for  the  microfinance \ninstitutions. \n \nHaving  been  inordinately  delayed,  CCS  reform  will  now  have  to  be  undertaken  in  the \n34. \ncontext  of  a  sharp  rural-urban  divide  and  deteriorating  social  conditions  in  the  countryside \n(paras.  3\u20136).  The  reform  agenda  will  thus  have  to  be  carefully  sequenced  to  forge  the \nstakeholder  consensus  necessary  to  sustain  the  reforms  and  to  maintain  social  stability.  In \nparticular,  given  the  long-term  declining  trend  of  agricultural  growth,  the  reform  process  must \nnot side track the slow improvement in the rural\u2013urban terms of trade witnessed since the early \n1990s.  Some  reform  areas,  such  as  the  liberalization  of  agricultural  pricing,  including  of  rural \ncredit,29  can  therefore  only  be  introduced  gradually  given  the  need  to  safeguard  the \ncompetitiveness of the rural economy (paras. 41\u201342). It is vitally important that the Government \nmove ahead with complementary measures for rural development (e.g., increased investment in \nrural infrastructure and liberalization of agricultural markets) given the multi-dimensional nature \nof  the  problem  and  the  significant  links  outside  the  rural  economy.  The  real  sector  reform \nagenda in agriculture (paras. 6 and 8, and Appendix 1) would impact on CCS reform positively \nshould the former be successful in creating a dynamic and flourishing agricultural sector. Hence, \nthe need for careful calibration and sequencing of reforms. \n \nGovernment  Strategy.  Reform  of  the  rural  finance  sector,  therefore,  emerged  as  a \n35. \ncritical  concern  and  strategic  priority  for  all  stakeholders  in  the  context  of  the  National \nAgricultural  Policy,  the  Tenth  Plan,  and  the  NCMP.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprovided  TA30  to  develop  a  comprehensive  rural  finance  reform  agenda,  comprising  the  CCS, \nRRBs, risk mitigation regimes, and CFMs. The TA study concluded that the immediate reform \nfocus  should  be  on  the  CCS  in  view  of  the  enormous  potential  benefits  and  critical  economic \nlinkages. Priority attention was also recommended for CFM development and crop insurance to \nfacilitate  improved  coverage  of  the  main  risks  small  farmers  face.  These  findings  were \nconsistent with the Government priority of providing quality services to rural clients in view of the \ndemand and supply gap for institutional rural finance services and growing rural\u2013urban income \ndisparities.  The  Government  is  also  considering  enacting  legislation  conducive  for  the \nmicrofinance institutions. \n \n36. \nConsensus quickly emerged that the initial reform focus should be on the CCS given the \nabsence of cost-effective and realistic alternatives that could substitute for its potential outreach \nwithin any reasonable time frame. The cost of liquidation, both financial and political, would be \nsignificantly  higher  than  the  estimated  cost  of  restructuring  the  CCS.  In  particular,  the  cost  of \n                                                 \n29  Dual  pricing  applies  to  the  CCS.  The  CCS  charges  lower  lending  interest  rates  as  required  for  loans  funded \nthrough NABARD refinance at concessional terms and those where the CCS receives interest rate subsidies from \nstate governments or the Government. In other cases, interest charges are determined by the CCS.  \n\n30  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Rural Finance Sector Restructuring and Development \nProject.  Manila  (TA  4247-IND  for  $1  million,  approved  on  12  December  2003,  financed  by  the  Department  of \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom).  This  TA  analyzed  the  CCS  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan, \nAndhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Kerala and designed reforms for two of these states. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n(i) \n\n  \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nfor \n\nredundancies, \n\nliabilities,  staff \n\nthe  weak  prospects \n\nrecovering \nundefined  pension \nnonperforming assets in the context of liquidation, and the concurrent fiscal impact on the state \ngovernments  providing  guarantees  to  CCS  borrowings  were  judged  to  be  too  large,  while  the \neconomic  and  social  dislocations  in  terms  of  income  and  employment  losses  for  both  existing \nand  potential  clients  were  viewed  as  untenable.  Seeking  to  increase  the  rural  operations  of \ncommercial banks through higher priority sector lending as an alternative to the CCS was also \nconsidered  inconsistent  with  the  banking  reforms,  while  rapid  expansion  of  the  RRBs  was \nunrealistic given its small client base. \n \n37. \nThe  Government  ultimately  decided  that  CCS  institutions  with  a  reasonable  chance  of \nbeing revived should be strengthened by addressing the root, rather than proximate causes of \ntheir weak performance. While the short- and long-term CCS have commonalities, based on the \ncredit needs of large numbers of small farmers, the Government felt it prudent to initially focus \non  the  short-term  CCS  given  its  broad  outreach  (nearly  85%  of  CCS  outreach)  and  primary \nfocus  on  agricultural  lending.  Accordingly,  the  Government  constituted  a  Task  Force  on \nRevitalization of the Short-term CCS (the Task Force) in August 2004 to develop a countrywide \nreform  program.  ADB  provided  backstopping  support  to  the  Task  Force,  and  its  final  report \n(Supplementary Appendix A) submitted on 5 February 2005\u2014which recommended fundamental \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  packaged  as  an  integrated  set  of  measures  to  be \nimplemented only in states that agree to carry out reforms in their entirety\u2014was consistent with \nthe earlier ADB TA findings. The underlying reform principles are as follows: \n \n\nA conducive policy and legal environment must be in place to enable the CCS to \noperate as self-governing and financially viable institutions. \n\nThe state governments should voluntarily cede control of the CCS.  \n\nSupervision  and  regulation  of  the  CCS  must  be  significantly  enhanced  with \neffective  enforcement  of  RBI  recommendations  for  CCS  entities  classified  as \nbanks. \n\nFinancial  assistance  should  be  provided  for  cleaning  up  accumulated  losses  to \nrestore  the  value  of  members\u2019  capital  in  the  CCS  and  given  as  a  grant  (not \nequity)  by  the  Government  and  state  governments  as  a  one-time,  phased \nmeasure linked to policy, legal, and institutional reforms.  \n\nOnly those institutions that meet defined criteria are eligible for reform assistance \nto  ensure  prudent  use  of  public  resources.  Institutions  with  no  turnaround \nprospects should be amalgamated or wound up.  \n\nSupport  to  PACSs  needs  to  be  prioritized  since  restructuring  the  intermediate \nand upper tiers without addressing the infirmities of the lowest tier is impractical. \n\nInstitutional  turnaround  needs  to  be  in  the  context  of  action  plans  with  financial \nand operational benchmarks.  \n\nthrough  an \n\nThe  Government, \n\n \n38. \nthe \nrecommendations in principle and placed them before the National Development Council at its \nmeeting of 27 June 2005. The Task Force report and its recommendations were subsequently \ndiscussed  in  depth  at  a  special  meeting  of  the  state  chief  ministers  on  9  September  2005.  A \ndraft  statement  of  the  consensus  emerging  from  the  deliberations  was  then  prepared  and \ndiscussed  with  the  finance  and  cooperation  ministers  of  selected  state  governments.  This \nmeeting was held on 29 September 2005, where the consensus was further crystallized into a \n\nintensive  consultative  process,  accepted \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n \n\nformal  statement  of  consensus,  following  which  the  finance  minister  conveyed  to  all  state \ngovernments a comprehensive CCS reform package. Ten states31 have conveyed concurrence \nwith the reform agenda thus far, which is expected to be formalized through memorandums of \nunderstanding  (MOU)  between  the  Government,  respective  state  governments,  and  NABARD \n(Supplementary Appendix B).  \n\n \n39. \nThe  initial  estimate  of  the  aggregate  cost  of  reform  of  the  short-term  CCS  is  $3,021 \nmillion. The Government has agreed to meet 68% ($2,054 million)32 of the estimated cost and \nthe balance is expected to be shared by the state governments ($846 million or 28%) and the \nCCS ($121 million or 4%). Of the total cost, $2,792 million (92%) is for cleaning up accumulated \nlosses  and  $229  million  (8%)  is  for  audit,  human  resource  development,  and  technological \nsupport.  In  view  of  the  large  costs,  the  Government  requested  external  funding  agencies  to \nsubstantially support CCS reform. Considering its involvement with CCS reform since 2003, the \nGovernment  requested  ADB  support  for  CCS  reforms  in  five  states.  The  German  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (KfW)  agreed  to  jointly  support  the  reforms  with  ADB,  while \nthe World Bank is also expected to provide financial support for CCS reform in 2007. \n\n \n40. \nThe CCS should have been reformed much earlier to minimize the financial and social \ncosts given its persistent weakness. However, the rural political economy did not  allow policy, \nlegal,  and  incentive  structures  to  change  during  previous  attempts  to  reform  the  CCS.  Those \nreform efforts inevitably failed and it was generally accepted that the CCS would always be in \nneed of financial support to sustain its operations. This perpetuated a vicious circle where the \npoorly  performing  CCS  could  not  provide  affordable  finance  to  the  poor,  while  the  political \ninterference  in  CCS  operations  inhibited  market  entry  by  other  financial  entities.  In  such  an \nenvironment,  state  government  participation  and  commitment  to  share  the  cost  of  reform  is  a  \nmajor achievement. \n \n41. \nGiven that the CCS has largely operated under state control, fostering a shift to quality of \nservice  and  sustainability  will  be  a  major  endeavor.  Even  though  the  MOUs  between  the \nGovernment  and  state  governments  emphasize  autonomy  for  the  CCS  in  business  decisions, \ntheir transformation into this new role will take some time. In particular, the CCS continues to be \nexposed  to  concessional  interest  rates  and  occasional  waivers  of  loans  under  government \ndirectives.  While  CCS  reform  process  intends  to  terminate  this  practice,  the  political  economy \nwill allow full commercialization to be phased in only gradually. In an environment of heightened \nrural discontent, a sudden upward shift in lending rates could worsen tensions that could delay \nand ultimately sidetrack CCS reform.  \n \n42. \nTo phase out the role of state governments and support the move to full autonomy, the \nGovernment  and  state  governments,  as  part  of  the  CCS  reform  agenda,  have  already \ncommitted  to  compensate  the  CCS  upfront  and  transparently  through  the  budget  for  any \ndirective to provide services below cost and forego receivables. The explicit recognition of this \nfinancial obligation will eventually result in the phase out of such interventions, given the need to \ncontain  fiscal  deficits  over  the  medium  term  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  Fiscal \nManagement and Budget Responsibility Act (2003), while providing the necessary financial and \noperational autonomy to the CCS in the interim. The CCS has already begun resisting directives \nrequiring  unviable  transactions  without  committed  compensation  in  any  event,  indicating  that \nprogress toward sustainability is already under way. Until such time as the rural sector catches \n\n                                                 \n31  Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab Rajasthan, Sikkim, and Tamil \n\n32 This is only an overall proportion. The sharing patterns differ across states based on the relative size of cost items \n\nidentified to be financed by the Government, state governments, and the CCS.  \n\nNadu.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nthe \n\nIn  addition,  NABARD, \n\nimplementation  agency,  has  established \n\nup with the rest of the economy, reform of the CCS should proceed carefully, while ensuring that \nthe state pays for any public policy objectives that it wants to achieve through the CCS. \n \n43. \nThe  results  achieved  through  CCS  reform  will  also  depend  on  the  effectiveness  with \nwhich  they  are  implemented.  Implementation  has  already  begun,  including  (i)  the  signing  of \nMOUs,  (ii)  initial  budgetary  provisions  of  about  $400  million  by  the  Government  and  state \ngovernments,  (iii)  preparatory  work  to  enhance  the  legal  reforms  pending  enactment  of \nlegislation, and (iv) assignment of auditors to determine a consistent bottom line for the financial \nrestructuring.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  setting  up  the  nationwide  implementation \nmechanism, including establishment of the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee \nheaded  by  the  Financial  Sector  Secretary  and  including  RBI,  NABARD,  and  the  state \ngovernments. \nthe \nDepartment  of  Cooperative  Revitalization  and  Reform  at  its  head  office.  CCS  reform \nimplementation  is  expected  to  benefit  from  the  experience  of  the  Government  in  guiding  the \nreform of the commercial banks and RRBs.  \n \nLessons.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  develop  sustainable  CCS  institutions  is \n44. \nconsistent with the lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience, particularly that (i) good governance \nand sustainability are required as the core principles for developing a strong rural finance sector \nfor  efficient  financial  intermediation;  (ii)  efficient  allocation  of  resources  require  autonomy  in \npricing and client selection; (iii) prolonged dependence on nonmarket-based refinance support \nundermines  sustainability  and  integration  with  the  financial  markets;  and  (iv)  repressive \nagricultural and exchange regime policies, weak extension, and inadequate rural infrastructure \ndepress  rural  incomes  and  impair  rural  finance  markets.  CCS  reform  also  incorporates  the \nlessons  from  initiatives  of  other  funding  agencies  in  India  (Appendix  3)  that  emphasize  (i)  in-\ndepth  financial  and  institutional  analysis;  (ii)  upfront  commitment  to  good  governance,  pricing, \nand discipline; (iii) clearly defined performance benchmarks; (iv) phasing with regard to capacity \nto manage and institutionalize changes; and (v) sequencing to minimize service disruption.  \n \n45.  While  not  on  the  same  scale,  international  experience  suggests  that  with  stakeholder \ncoordination  and  commitment,  it  will  be  possible  to  reform  India\u2019s  CCS.  For  example,  Bank \nRakyat Indonesia (Unit Desas) was restructured into a highly profitable entity from a politicized \nand  loss-making  credit  agency  for  rice  farmers.  Other  successful  restructuring  cases  include \nBank Pertanian Malaysia and Banco Agricola de la Republica in the Dominican Republic, while \nthe  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Agricultural  Cooperatives  in  Thailand  extended  its  coverage  to \nmost  rural  households \nincluded  good \ngovernance,  managerial  autonomy,  staff  accountability  and  incentives,  low  transaction  costs, \nflexible  product  design  and  pricing,  effective  risk  management  and  monitoring,  emphasis  on \nsavings, diversified portfolios, and advanced information technology. \n \n  \nADB Strategy. Inclusive social development is a key strategic priority of ADB and one of \n46. \nthe three pillars of ADB operations in India, along with sustainable economic growth and good \ngovernance. In light of this, ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program update33 highlights the \nneed for strengthening the rural finance sector to promote growth and stability of rural incomes \nand employment. In line with the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan and its Midterm Assessment, ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  also  recognizes  that  rural  infrastructure  to  support  diversification  into  higher  value-\nadded crops, and development of CFMs and agribusinesses to help small farmers diversify risk, \nas  well  as  enhanced  irrigation  infrastructure  throughout  the  country,  are  also  critical  for \naccelerating agricultural growth and rural development. Project interventions are planned in all \nthese areas in ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for 2007\u20132009. \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): India. Manila. \n\nthrough  enhanced  operational  practices.  These \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n \n\nDonor  Coordination.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  financed  ADB\u2019s  TA  to \n47. \nhelp develop the CCS reform agenda, and is also providing additional grant financing for the TA \nattached to this Program (para. 85). The lead role of ADB in developing the Program has also \nbeen  closely  coordinated  with  KfW,  in  view  of  its  long  track  record  of  involvement  in  rural \nfinance in India and substantial funding to support the reforms. KfW has worked extensively with \nNABARD in developing nonfarm lending programs and is also piloting loan-based approaches \nto watershed development. In addition, the German Technical Cooperation Agency has helped \nNABARD develop an implementation planning and monitoring framework for CCS reform.  \n \n48. \nSince early 2006, the Government has proactively sought support for CCS reform from \nexternal funding agencies. The CCS reform agenda has been reviewed by ADB and the World \nBank  to  coordinate  their  approaches  in  providing  financial  support  for  the  reforms.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  has  endorsed  the  enhanced  regulation  and  supervision  of  the \nCCS, while  cautioning Government to proceed carefully on reform implementation to preserve \npublic confidence in the financial system. ADB has also shared its work on CCS reform with the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  and  is  closely  coordinating  its  proposed  interventions  in  CFMs  and \nagribusiness  with  the  latter.34  In  regard  to  CFMs,  USAID  is  focusing  on  legal  and  institutional \nstrengthening  of  CFM  regulation,  surveillance  and  enforcement,  and  the  development  of \ninstitutional  infrastructure  to  improve  market  efficiency.  On  the  agricultural  side,  USAID  has \nstarted  several  initiatives  to  test  how  marketing  chains  in  agriculture  can  be  improved  and \nfostered  partnerships  between  US  land  grant  universities  and  Indian  state  agricultural \nuniversities  to  improve  agribusiness  and  marketing  capacity.  Rabobank  and  the  Rabo \nDevelopment  Program  of  the  Netherlands  are  also  considering  substantial  support  for  CCS \nreforms, and ADB has shared its work on CCS reform with them.  \n \n49. \nFunding  agencies  either  already  processing  their  support  for  CCS  reform  or  actively \nconsidering such support have the advantage of leveraging ADB and KfW\u2019s work in designing \ntheir interventions. In addition, the components of grant TA attached to the Program (paras. 85\u2013\n86) provided by the Government of the United  Kingdom could be replicated and expanded by \nother  funding  agencies.  The  Program  also  incorporates  mechanisms  to  ensure  broad-based \nstakeholder  consultations.  In  order  to  avoid  overlaps,  ADB  and  KfW  assistance  will  focus  on \nselected states.   \n \n\nIV.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n\n \nThe  Program  has  been  designed  to  help  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda,  which  was \n50. \nformulated  with  ADB  TA  (para.  47)  to  accelerate  rural  economic  growth  by  addressing  the  key \nconstraints  in  rural  finance.  Good  governance  and  reduced  government  involvement  will  be  at \nthe  core  of  CCS  reform  to  ensure  equitable  and  improved  access  for  small  and  marginal \nfarmers to rural finance services. The Program is the outcome of intensive policy dialogue that \nhas  been  carried  out  over  a  period  of  3  years and  was  closely  coordinated  with  stakeholders, \nincluding  NABARD,  selected  state  governments,  the  Task  Force,  other  development  partners, \nand  NGOs.35 The  Program\u2019s  main  features  are  described  in the  development  policy letter  and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 5. \n\n                                                 \n34  ADB  is  providing  TA  (Strengthening  Commodity  Markets,  component  TA  under  TA  4814-IND:  [ADB.  2006. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  India  for  Project  Processing  and  Capacity  Development.  Manila])  to  build  capacity  of \nsector  institutions,  which  is  expected  to  provide  the  basis  for  an  ensuing  ADB  loan  project  in  2007  aimed  at \ndeveloping commodity market infrastructure. This TA is financed by the Government of the United Kingdom through \nthe Department for International Development. \n\n35 Chronology of processing is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nA. \n \n51. \nThe goal of the Program is to develop a sustainable CCS and the objective is to help the \nGovernment carry out its CCS reform agenda. Its impact is enhanced income and employment \ngrowth for the rural poor, while its purpose is to improve rural households\u2019 access to affordable \nfinancial  services  through  an  efficient  CCS.  The  scope  is  comprehensive  CCS  reform  in  five \nstates\u2014from among Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and \nOrissa\u2014that  have  concurred  with  the  reform  agenda.36  A  profile  of  these  states,  including  the \nstatus of the CCS, is discussed in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix D. The first five of \nthese states have 5 SCBs, 136 DCCBs, and 43,227 PACSs with about 41 million members.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions  \n\n52. \nThe Program has three components: (i) establishing a policy reform and implementation \nframework;  (ii)  building  a  facilitating  legal,  regulatory,  and  governance  framework;  and  (iii) \ninstitutional reforms for sustainability.  \n\nEstablishing a Policy Reform and Implementation Framework \n\n \n53. \nAs  the  CCS  was  established  and  supported  by  the  Government,  its  present  impaired \ncondition  is  also  the  result  of  government  interference.  This  requires  policy  reforms  and  an \nimplementation framework where the states withdraw from operating the CCS while improving \nits  operating  environment,  including  through  transparent  and  upfront  provision  of  any  interest \nrate subsidies or debt forgiveness through the budget. Specifically, under the Program: \n  \n\nThe Task Force reviews the performance of the CCS and develops a nationwide \nreform  package  for  the  CCS,  including  the  SCBs,  DCCBs,  and  PACSs \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n\nConsensus  is  reached  on  CCS  reform  between  Government  and  state \ngovernments based on the recommendations of the Task Force. \n\nThe  Government  communicates  the  CCS  reform  framework  to  the  state \ngovernments, including financing and implementation arrangements. \n\nAt least five states, hereinafter referred as participating states (PS), sign MOUs \nwith the Government and NABARD accepting the CCS reform package, including \ncommitment to share the costs and to ensure full autonomy for CCS in financial \nand internal administrative matters. \n\n(v) \n\nThe Government and PSs make budgetary provisions to support CCS reform. \n\n(vi) \n\nA  National  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Committee  is  constituted  to  oversee \nthe reform process. \n\n \n(vii)  NABARD  establishes  the  Department  of  Cooperative  Revitalization  and  Reform \n\nat its head office to support CCS reform. \n\n \n1. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n36  Andhra  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  and  Rajasthan  have  signed  the  MOUs.  The  Government  in \nconsultation with ADB will indicate the fifth PS to be covered under the Program by March 2007 from among the \nremaining two states (Gujarat and Orissa). While the main text of this document uses Gujarat data for aggregate \npurposes, discussion of the CCS in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix D refer to all the six states.  \n\n\f17 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(viii)  The  PSs  establish  state-level  implementation  committees  (SLIC)  and  district-\n\nlevel implementation committees (DLIC). \n\nNABARD  constitutes  state  task  forces  in  the  PSs  to  periodically  review \nperformance  of  the  CCS\u2014including  good  governance,  and  compliance  with \nstatutory requirements\u2014and suggest improvements. \n\nThe Government convenes stakeholder consultations to obtain feedback on the \nassessment of CCS reform by an independent agency and, as required, provides \nfor appropriate measures.  \n\nOf  the  above,  items  (i)\u2013(vii)  have  largely  been  completed  as  prior  actions  and  set  a \n\n \n54. \nstrong foundation for implementation of the Program components described below. \n \n\n2. \n\nBuilding a Facilitating Legal, Regulatory, and Governance Framework  \n\n \n\na. \n\nEstablishing a Conducive Legal Framework for CCS  \n\n \n \n \n55. \nTo ensure autonomy and revive the self-help characteristics of the CCS, the Task Force \nhas  recommended  amendments  to  the  CSAs  with  overriding  provisions  to  ensure  the \nimplementation of its recommendations and convincingly set the basis for a paradigm shift in CCS \noperations. This will also harmonize the CSAs with the MACSAs. Under the Program:  \n \n\nThe  PSs  amend  the  CSAs,  initially  through  interim  measures  so  that  the  legal \nchanges  can  take  effect  immediately,  and  eventually  through  amended  CSAs. \nThe list of requirements is attached to the development policy letter (Appendix 4). \n\nThe  PSs  issue  implementing  rules  and  regulations  corresponding  to  the \namended CSAs and put them into practice. \n\nThe  Government  assesses  the  need  to  amend  the  NABARD  Act  1982  and  the \nDeposit  Insurance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Corporation  of  India  Act  1961  and,  if \nrequired, amends these statutes. \n\nb. \n\nEstablishing Effective Regulation \n\n \nEffective regulation of the CCS requires removing the regulatory ambiguity and ensuring \n56. \nthat  all  SCBs,  DCCBs,  and  PACSs  taking  nonmember  deposits  are  fully  subject  to  prudential \nnorms set by the RBI, and that PACSs transacting business only with members are supervised \nby  the  registrar  of  cooperatives  based  on  prudential  norms  agreed  by  NABARD.  Under  the \nProgram:  \n \n\nThe  Government  amends  the  Banking  Regulation  Act  of  1949  to  introduce \nregulations at par with commercial banks for all CCS entities classified as banks \nand other provisions as attached to the development policy letter (Appendix 4). \n\nEnhanced prudential norms for SCBs and DCCBs and guidelines on eligibility for \nboards of directors and chief executive officers of SCBs and DCCBs are issued. \n\nThe  PSs  issue  prudential  norms  for  all  nonbank  CCS  institutions  (especially \nPACSs) in consultation with NABARD and report on their implementation. \n\n(i) \n\n   \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nSupervision  and  regulation  of  CCS  undertaken  in  PSs  in  accordance  with \namended CSAs and prudential norms for PACSs are applied. \n\nc. \n\nEnhancing Good Governance  \n\n \n57. \nIn  most  states,  elections  to  CCS  boards  have  been  irregular  and  significantly  delayed, \neven for decades. The resulting politicization and poor governance has eroded the ability of the \nCCS  to  meet  the  demands  of  its  members.  By  reintroducing  regular  elections,  the  democratic \ncharacter of the CCS will be restored and reinforced by a governance framework that separates \nownership  from  management  and  seeks  accountability.  To  enhance  good  governance,  the \nProgram will ensure the following:  \n \n\nThe PSs prepare plans and hold elections for the CCS where the terms of boards \nand  other  office  bearers  have  expired,  and  conduct  elections  to  install  new \ndirectors and other office bearers. \n\nThe  PSs  reduce  their  equity  to  a  maximum  of  25%  at  all  tiers  of  the  CCS  and \nconvert the amount in excess of 25% to grants to the CCS. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe PSs withdraw state government nominees on the boards of PACSs. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe PSs limit participation in SCBs and DCCBs to one nominee on the board. \n\nThe PSs identify and remove board of directors at SCBs and DCCBs not meeting \nthe approved criteria for such positions. \n\nNABARD issues a policy of annual audits of SCBs and DCCBs by independent \nchartered accountants commencing FY2007. \n\n(vii)  NABARD  issues  guidelines  for  independent  rating  of  SCBs  and  DCCBs.  Two \n\nsuch ratings are conducted during the Program period.  \n\n(viii)  SCBs and DCCBs terminate the tenure of directors on their boards representing \n\nPACSs that have defaulted in their obligations to DCCBs.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n3. \n\nInstitutional Reforms for Sustainability \n\n \n58. \nPolicy, legal, and regulatory reforms alone are not sufficient to transform the CCS. The \ncentury-old  CCS  has  mostly  operated  under  a  paradigm  that  has  repressed  viable  financial \nintermediation. A lack of viability imperatives under weak governance led to high overheads and \ninefficiencies.  While  these  seemed  intractable  in  the  past,  within  the  context  of  the  ongoing \nfinancial  sector  reforms,  it  is  possible  to  restructure  the  CCS  by  fundamentally  altering \ngovernance and operational norms. The social capital and sunk costs of the widespread CCS \nnetwork, often in places without banks, could be put to  more efficient use through institutional \nreforms  within  the  context  of  action  plans  for  revival/development  action  plans  for  PACSs, \nDCCBs,  and  SCBs  with  sequenced  organizational,  institutional,  and  financial  restructuring \nmeasures.  As  the  building  blocks  of  the  CCS,  initial  priority  will  be  accorded  to  restructuring \nPACSs. Under the Program: \n  \n\n(i) \n\nNABARD  develops  and  implements  (a)  accounting  standards;  (b)  management \ninformation  systems, \n(c) \ncomputerization plans; and (d) human resource development plans.  \n\ninternal  control  and  audit  systems; \n\nincluding \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n(ii) \n\nNABARD develops guidelines linking refinance to CCS reform implementation. \n\nNABARD  considers  refinance  to  the  CCS  either  directly  or  through  other \nregulated financial institutions at terms set by its Board. \n\nNABARD develops formats and guidelines for special audits of PACSs to assess \nthe  extent  of  accumulated  losses  as  on  31  March  2004  and  conducts  sample \naudits.  \n\nNABARD  develops  model  action  plans  for  revival/development  action  plans  for \nPACSs, DCCBs, and SCBs, including financial and operational benchmarks. \n\nSpecial audits of PACSs, DCCBs and SCBs are conducted to assess the extent \nof  accumulated  losses  as  on  31  March  2004,  factoring  in  the  results  of  the \nrespective lower tiers. \n\n(vii)  DCCBs  and  PACSs  sign  agreements  with  DLICs,  and  SCBs  sign  agreements \n\nwith SLICs to implement CCS reform. \n\n(viii)  PACSs,  DCCBs,  and  SCBs  adopt  and \n\nimplement  action  plans \n\nfor \n\nrevival/development action plans. \n\nThe  PSs  discontinue  further  placement  of  cadre-based  secretaries  in  PACSs, \nand develop and implement a plan for phasing out such posts. \n\nNABARD provides financial support for cleaning accumulated losses37 of SCBs, \nDCCBs, and eligible PACSs in PSs that meet the benchmark requirements of the \nMOU. \n\nThe PSs develop and implement action plans for ineligible PACSs.  \n\n \nTo qualify for financial support and ensure that major actions are taken upfront, the PSs \n59. \nwill complete the following for the first release of financial assistance from the Government: (i) \nspecial audits, (ii) CCS institutions sign agreements with SLICs and DLICs, (iii) measures to put \nthe proposed amendments to the CSAs into effect, and (iv) release of their proportionate share \nof the reform costs. The second release of financial assistance will be subject to (i) the CSAs \nbeing  amended,  (ii)  conduct  of  elections  wherever  due,  and  (iii)  appointment  of  professional \nboards and chief operating officers.  \n \nAssessments indicate that much of the problems in the CCS result directly from political \n60. \ninterference.  Therefore,  the  envisaged  changes  in  the  operating  environment  provide  a  much \nbetter chance of revival than the current financial performance may suggest. Within this context, \nthe financial assistance for cleaning accumulated losses as on 31 March 2004 for PACSs with \nrepayment levels of 50% and above will be provided subject to completion of upfront actions by \nthe respective PSs. PACSs with repayment levels between 30% to 50% will receive assistance \n\n                                                 \n37  These include losses due to (i) nonrepayment of loans for agricultural and other purposes such as consumer goods \nand housing; (ii) losses on account of noncredit businesses such as the public distribution system, procurement of \nfood  grains  on  behalf  of  government,  and  sale  of  fertilizers;  (iii)  nonrepayment  of  loans  under  government \nguarantees  where  state  governments  have  not  paid  invoked  guarantees  to  the  CCS;  and  (iv)  nonrepayment  of \ndues from governments due to waivers or subsidies announced by them and losses from fraud.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImportant Features  \n\nin  three  annual  back-ended  installments  subject  to  their  achieving  an  incremental  increase  in \nthe collection of dues and the respective PSs meeting the requirements outlined in the previous \nparagraph. Performance targets outlined in the action plans for revival/development action plans \nwill be monitored. \n \nC. \n \n61. \nThe Government\u2019s intention to pursue a substantive CCS reform program allows ADB to \nparticipate  in  a  high-priority  development  intervention.  The  request  for  ADB  support  is  in \nrecognition of its involvement in developing the initial CCS reform framework for two states and \nalso in backstopping the work of the Task Force.  \n \nInclusive  and  Sustainable  Growth.  Inclusive  overall  economic  growth  is  the  single \n62. \nmost powerful mechanism to generate sustainable rural development and reduce poverty. In the \ncontext  of  national  policies  (para.  6)  aimed  at  achieving  this  objective,  the  Program  provides \ncritical  support  for  minimizing  the  rural\u2013urban  divide  by  systematically  empowering  the  rural \npopulation at the community level with opportunities to meaningfully participate in, and benefit \nfrom,  economic  growth.  Broader  sharing  of  the  benefits  of  growth  will  enhance  social  stability \nand mitigate farmer distress, and hence, reinforce the sustainability of the development process. \n \nThe  Consensus-building  Approach  for  CCS  Reform.  The  consensus-building \n63. \napproach adopted by the Task Force and subsequently by the Government in forging the CCS \nreform  agenda,  has  facilitated  state  governments\u2019  \u201cbuy-in\u201d  to  the  reform  process,  which  had \nbeen  elusive  in  previous  reform  efforts  and  enhances  the  likelihood  of  success.  Consensus \nbuilding  has  been  and  will  remain  the  most  critical  factor  for  the  successful  implementation  of \nCCS  reform.  Both  the  Government  and  the  state  governments  have  so  far  shown  remarkable \nappreciation  of  the  need  for  CCS  reform  and  accordingly  made  adjustments  in  their  stated \npositions  to  move  the  CCS  reform  agenda  forward.  The  process  has  been  both  intense  and \nsubstantive  as  sociopolitical  factors  in  addition  to  financial  intermediation  aspects  have  to  be \nconsidered in view of the widespread farmer distress. While there is consensus on the reform \nagenda,  commitment  to  meet  the  political  and  financial  costs  by  state  governments  will  take \ntime.  Therefore,  it  has  taken  more  than  3  years  to  arrive  at  a  stage  where  CCS  reform  could \ncommence in selected states. Ten states have so far concurred in principle. Of these, five states \nare  part  of  the  Program.  It  is  expected  that  most  states  will  eventually  adopt  the  CCS  reform \npackage.  \n \n64.  Major  Shift  in  Rural  Political  Economy.  The  reform  agenda  supports  a  shift  in  the \npolitical economy of the rural sector by aligning the policies and laws with regard to the CCS. A \nstrengthened  CCS  will  help  create  fiscal  space  for  the  state  governments  to  undertake  much \nneeded investments in rural development over the medium term. \n \n65. \nPhasing  Out  the  Role  of  State  Governments.  Phasing  out  the  entrenched  and \nintrusive state interventions in the CCS will restore the balance in favor of its membership. The \nGovernment and state governments will provide the resources to defray the cumulative costs of \ntheir inappropriate interventions and facilitate the transfer of operational control of the CCS to its \nmembers  through  an  enhanced  legal,  governance,  and  supervisory  framework  that  is  also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy.  \n \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy.  The  program  design  integrates  the  key  elements  of \n66. \nADB\u2019s  strategies  for  poverty  reduction,  rural  development,  and  microfinance  development  as \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\n \n\nImpacts \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nwell as its rural finance market analysis.38 The Government\u2019s emphasis on reform of CFMs, risk \nmitigation, and secured transactions39 are consistent with ADB\u2019s operational strategy for India. \nConsidering  the  evolutionary  nature  of  the  reforms,  the  Program  is  designed  to  incorporate \nlessons learned from international and local interventions in the sector. \n \n67.  Maximizing  Long-term \nthrough  Good  Governance.  The  Program \nfundamentally  alters  the  norms  for  CCS  governance  and  operations.  By  shifting  emphasis  to \nsystemic issues affecting the CCS, and by directly addressing the issue of poor governance in \nthe CCS, the Program facilitates a level playing field in rural economic relations.  \n \nD. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $1.0 billion equivalent from its ordinary capital \n68. \nresources, with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate-based  lending  facility, \nincluding  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set \nforth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  Program  will  be  cofinanced  by  KfW,  which  has  committed \n\u20ac140  million  in  a  parallel  financing  arrangement  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  KfW\u2019s  financial \nsupport will also target CCS reform in the PSs covered under the Program and its phasing will \nbe synchronized with that of ADB. Given the close coordination with KfW in program preparation \nover 3 years, this cofinancing arrangement is important for ADB to expand its relationship with a \nkey development partner in a critical operational area. \n \n69. \nCCS  reform  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing  issues  and  socially \nsignificant measures to enhance credit outreach to the small and marginal farmers. To expedite \nand  mainstream  CCS  reform  in  the  PSs,  the  loan  amount  and  magnitude  of  KfW\u2019s  financial \nsupport  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  estimated  adjustment  costs  of  $1.43  billion.40 \nAdjustment costs will be triggered by policy, legal, and institutional reforms. The PSs account for \na  large  portion  (nearly  half)  of  the  overall  adjustment  costs  of  $3.02  billion.  While  the  cost  of \nreform is expected to exceed these estimates, there is also a possibility that the fiscal situation \nof  some  PSs  may  improve  significantly  during  the  Program  period.  In  this  event,  it  is  possible \nthat such PSs may seek to fund a greater proportion of their share of the cost of reform from out \ntheir own resources. This will be monitored during implementation.41   \n \n70. \nThe Government is seeking to mobilize significant financial resources upfront to ensure \nthat financing is adequate to support early adopters as they move ahead with the reforms, given \nthe important demonstration effect it would have in encouraging other states to join the reform \nprocess  (para.  43).  In  terms  of  other  financing  partners,  the  World  Bank  has  indicated  that  it \nplans to provide an initial loan of $500 million in 2007 that could be topped by a similar amount. \nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation may consider support during its next fiscal year \n\n                                                 \n38 ADB.  2000.

Considering the \npoor quality of information especially at the PACSs level, the actual cost of cleaning the accumulated losses will be \nknown after the special audits.  \n\n41 The fiscal status of PSs is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n \n\n\fbased on experience of Program implementation. In addition, Rabobank has informed that it is \nalso considering a $600 million package to support CCS reform.   \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management and Implementation \n\nHigh-level  coordination  of \n\n71. \nThe implementation mechanisms have been designed on a modular basis (Appendix 7), \nin line with the structure of the reform process that stipulates uniform reform content in each PS \nwithin the overall policy framework. The Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the \nexecuting  department  for  the  Program  and  NABARD  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The \nDepartment  of  Cooperative  Revival  and  Reform  at  NABARD\u2019s  head  office  will  serve  as  the \nprogram management unit.  \n \n72. \nThe Ministry of Finance will release ADB and KfW loan funds to NABARD and will take \noverall  responsibility  for  program  financial  management  and  reporting.  NABARD,  in  turn,  will \noversee day-to-day implementation of the Program. It will channel funds to the CCS for cleaning \nthe  accumulated  losses  based  on  the  achievement  of  reform  benchmarks.  In  addition,  it  will \nboth manage and incur all other expenses relating to Program actions.  \n \nthe  National \n73. \nImplementation and Monitoring Committee, which will be the Program\u2019s steering committee. The \nSLICs to be established in the PSs will serve as state level steering committees. The SLICs will \ncoordinate the efforts of the DLICs. NABARD\u2019s regional and district offices will provide technical \nand  financial  support  to  the  SLICs  and  DLICs.  In  the  PSs,  the  SLICs  and  DLICs  will  sign \ninstitution-specific  agreements  with  the  three  tiers  of  the  CCS  and  have  the  important  role  of \nenforcing  the  conditions  associated  with  financial  restructuring  and  release  of  financial \nassistance, as well as tracking the progress of state-level reforms.  \n \n74. \nEfficient  management  of  CCS  reform  is  crucial  to  avoid  disruption  of  service  delivery \nwhile reducing rural poverty and farmer distress. NABARD\u2019s experience in facilitating nationwide \nreform  of  RRBs  will  be  a  critical  success  factor  for  effective  implementation  of  CCS  reform. \nNABARD has a national presence and well-regarded training institutions for agriculture banking \nand  rural  development.  NABARD\u2019s  network  of  nearly  220  district  offices  will  be  used  to \ncoordinate CCS reform. \n \n\nthe  reform  effort  will  be  provided  by \n\nThe Program will be implemented during 2006\u20132010. The Government intends to fulfill \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n75. \nall tranche-release conditions within a 3-year period (Appendix 8).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n76. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the \nGovernment  as  the  Borrower.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced in, and procured \nfrom,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources and from countries \nthat are not ADB members. The Government will certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible \nimports is equal to or exceeds ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5. \n\nperiod; and (ii) the policy loan proceeds will be used as agreed in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \nThe policy loan proceeds will be disbursed based on certification provided by the Government, \nwhich  confirms  that  the  above  loan  requirements  have  been  met.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  monitor  the  use  of  counterpart  funds  for  meeting  the \n\nCounterpart Funds  \n\n \n77. \nadjustment costs associated with CCS reform.  \n\nTranching and Monitoring \n\n \n78.  Monitorable and time-bound actions for tranche release are indicated in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 4). The proposed loan will be released in four tranches over a 3 year period. The first \ntranche  of  $250  million  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  compliance  with  the  first \ntranche release conditions, the second tranche of $250 million will be released within 12 months \nof  the  first  tranche,  the  third  tranche  of  $300  million  will  be  released  within  12  months  of  the \nsecond tranche, and the fourth tranche of $200 million will be released within 12 months of the \nthird tranche subject to compliance with the conditions for their release. KfW\u2019s assistance will be \nsynchronized  with  ADB.  Based  on  the  requisite  Government  approvals,  the  first  KfW \ndisbursement  (indicative  amount  \u20ac65  million)  is  expected  in  mid-2007  and  will  be  based  on \nKfW\u2019s assessment of progress of Program implementation. Subsequent tranche releases will be \nin  tandem  with  ADB.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  KfW  will  regularly  and  closely  monitor \nProgram  implementation,  and  an  independent  agency,  to  be  engaged  under  the  grant  TA \n(paras. 85\u201386), will assess reform implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nAn  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  undertaken  if  requested  by  ADB  and \n79. \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  a  deposit  account  at  RBI  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The Banking \nDivision will send semi-annual reports to ADB status of program actions. The Banking Division, \nthrough  NABARD,  will  maintain separate records and  accounts on the  use of counterpart funds \nfollowing sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts and records audited annually \nby auditors acceptable to ADB, and will furnish, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, \ncertified copies of the audit report together with the auditor\u2019s opinion to the Government and ADB.   \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n80. \n The  Government  will  keep  ADB  and  KfW  informed  of  the  progress  of  CCS  reform.  A \nprogram performance monitoring system (PPMS) will be established to track reform progress. A \nbiannual report generated by the PPMS will be submitted by NABARD to the Government and \nADB within 2 months of end of each half year. The PPMS will track implementation of the policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  4)  in  the  PSs  including  the  (i)  status  and  implementation  of  policies;  (ii) \nprogress on the legislative amendments; (iii) status of governance reforms, especially in terms \nof  autonomy  and  reduced  state  control;  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  for  sustainability  of \neach tier of the CCS. In addition, the report will note progress in achieving the indicators set out \nin  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  5)  and  include  appendices  documenting \ntranche release compliance. \n\n \n\n\f8. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption  \n\nThe  financial  and  operational  information  for  SCBs  and  DCCBs  will  be  tracked  for  (i) \n81. \ncapital  adequacy;  (ii)  aggregated  financial  indicators  covering  savings,  loan  portfolio,  and \nrepayment  performance;  and  (iii)  efficiency  indicators  such  as    per  staff  business  and \ntransaction  costs.  Data  for  PACSs  will  include  capital  adequacy,  repayment  rate,  member \nsavings, loan portfolio, and outreach (small and marginal farmers and women). The respective \nDCCBs  will  help  collate  data  relating  to  PACSs.42  In  addition,  until  PACSs  are  computerized, \nsamples will be selected to provide the basis for performance assessment.  \n \n \n \n82. \nThe  Program  directly  addresses  the  weak  governance  in  the  CCS  by  (i)  phasing  out \nstate  government\u2019s  role,  (ii)  establishing  a  legal  framework  that  ensures  autonomy,  (iii) \nreintroducing regular elections and restoring their democratic character, (iv) instituting effective \nregulation and streamlining of regulatory processes, and (v) implementing institutional reforms. \nCCS  reform  reduces  the  vulnerability  to  corruption  by  ensuring  (i)  corporate  governance  is \nenhanced  in  the  CCS  by  the  PSs,  (ii)  compliance  with  transparency  and  disclosure \nrequirements, and (iii) adequate monitoring mechanisms are in place (Appendix 10).  \n \n83. \nIn addition, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  In  this  context,  a \nfinancial management assessment was also undertaken by NABARD (Supplementary Appendix \nG) to provide assurance that ADB loan funds will be used for their intended purpose. ADB will \nregularly review the financial reports of the audit authorities to assess any potential financial and \nadministrative  irregularities.  During  regular  review  missions,  the  financial  management,  and \ngovernance and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure that their provisions \nremain valid and are helping the reforms to succeed. \n\n \n9. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n84. \nADB, KfW, and the Government will review program implementation semi-annually. The \nreviews will include evaluation of the program scope, implementation, progress, reform agenda, \ncapacity-building,  disbursements \nrisk \nassessments,  and  related  matters.  ADB  will  also  field  regular  review  missions,  including \nmidterm review and program completion missions. Based on the midterm review, modifications \nand  improvements  will  be  considered  in  achieving  the  overall  objectives  of  the  Program.  A \nprogram  completion  report  will  be  provided  by  the  Government  within  3  months  of  program \ncompletion.  \n \n\nto  end  beneficiaries,  governance,  anticorruption \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n85. \nA  TA  grant  from  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  through  the  Department  for \nInternational Development in the amount of $2.0 million is attached to the Program. The goal of \nthe  TA  titled  Capacity  Building  for  Rural  Cooperative  Credit  Structure  Reform  is  to  support \nis  expeditious \nimplementation  of  CCS  reform  under \n\nthe  Program  and \n\nits  objective \n\n                                                 \n42  The  SCBs  and  DCCBs  already  have  an  extensive  information  bases  for  statutory  and  non-statutory  compliance. \nHowever,  data  with  regard  to  PACSs  lack  authenticity  and  are  inordinately  delayed  to  serve  any  meaningful \npurpose.  Cognizant  of  this  systemic  inadequacy,  the  Program  supports  strengthening  of  the  management \ninformation system.  \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\n \n\ncommencement  of  CCS  reform.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  strengthen  implementation  and \nmonitoring of CCS reform and enhance its social and gender impacts. The TA will consist of the \nfollowing components: \n \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring System. The TA will facilitate the setting up \nand implementation of the PPMS as described in paras. 80\u201381.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nCapacity Building of State-level Institutions. The TA will (i) develop guidelines \non  CCS  reform  implementation  for  SLICs  and  DLICs,  (ii)  hold  statewise \nworkshops on the guidelines, and (iii) organize seminars for SLICs and DLICs on \nexperience sharing and lessons learned.  \n\nOutreach to Poor Rural Women. The TA will work collaboratively with NABARD \nto  pilot  test  innovative  approaches  to  assist  diversification  of  income-earning \nopportunities and enhance credit outreach to poor rural women in the context of \nCCS  reform.  Baseline  indicators  will  be  developed  and  an  initial  survey \nconducted  to  provide  a  basis  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  CCS \nreform.  \n\nAssessment of CCS Reform Implementation. CCS reform implementation will \nbe assessed during the duration of the Program by an independent agency to be \nrecruited under the TA. The independent agency in arriving at its conclusion will \ndraw on the PPMS and also collect documentary evidence of reform compliance \nas required by ADB and KfW. The assessment reports will be submitted no later \nthan  3  weeks  prior  to  the  anticipated  date  of  tranche  release  and  will  cover  (i) \nstatus  and  implementation  of  policies  constituting  the  operating  environment  of \nthe  CCS;  (ii)  progress  on  the  legislative  amendments;  (iii)  status  of  governance \nreforms,  especially  in  terms  of  autonomy  and  reduced  state  controls;  and  (iv) \ninstitutional strengthening for sustainability of each tier of the CCS. \n\n \n86. \nThe Banking Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing department for the \nTA  and  NABARD  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  Banking  Division  will  form  a  TA \nimplementation committee comprising of two senior officers each from the Banking Division and \nNABARD. ADB will engage TA consultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006)  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection and simplified technical proposal methods will be used. The scale of consultant \ninputs,  terms  of  reference,  cost estimates,  and  implementation  arrangements  are  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. The implementation of the TA will also be closely coordinated with \n(i)  the  consultants  engaged  by  KfW  as  part  of  their  proposed  TA;  (ii)  the  ongoing  work  by \nGerman  Technical  Cooperation  Agency  to  develop  a  detailed  implementation  planning  and \nmonitoring framework for CCS reform; and (iii) the assistance from other funding agencies that \nare actively considering support for CCS reform.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n \nA. \n \n87. \nBecause  the  problems  in  the  CCS  impose  significant  social  and  economic  costs,  the \nbenefits of reform could be large. Enhanced access by rural households to affordable financial \nservices  and  related  improvement  in  growth  and  employment  in  rural  areas  could  potentially \nbenefit  nearly  41  million  members  of  the  CCS  in  the  PSs.  The  overall  impact  becomes \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nsignificantly  larger  if  the  estimated  160  million  members  of  their  households  are  included. \nHowever,  in  view  of  the  multitude  of  deep-seated  problems,  institutional  change  and  thus  the \nbenefits of reform are expected to materialize only gradually. \n \n\n1. \n\nPolicy  \n\n \n88. \nFinancial  institutions  can  respond  to  growth  opportunities  only  when  they  operate  in  a \nfavorable policy environment and are commercially oriented, appropriately governed, organized, \nand equipped. Program supported reforms will provide this critical linkage.  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nHarmonization of the policy and legal framework between Government and state \ngovernments  with  regard  to  the  CCS  will  create  an  environment  that  will \nstrengthen the rural finance sector. \n\nPhasing out the state government\u2019s role will restore the autonomy of the CCS as \nmember-owned and -managed financial intermediaries. \n\nAt  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  levels,  the  new  norms  and  incentives  set  for \nthe CCS will facilitate development of sustainable rural finance markets. \n\nExtending the core values of good governance and transparency will strengthen \nthe integration of the CCS with the mainstream financial sector. \n\nA viable CCS will not only intermediate its own savings, but also raise resources \nfrom money markets and help reduce outflow of rural savings. \n\nGradual broadening and deepening of services offered by the CCS will respond \nto  the  heterogeneous  demand  profile,  growing  significance  of  the  rural  nonfarm \nsector, and immense savings potential of rural areas.  \n\n(vii)  CCS  reform  will  strengthen  the  synergy  between  the  CCS  institutions,  risk \n\nmitigation strategies, and CFM initiatives. \n\n(viii)  CCS  reform  will  create  broad-based  support  to  sustain  policies  for  economic \ngrowth, including further reform in the rural finance sector once the CCS is able \nto institutionalize the reforms supported by the Program. \n\n2.  \n\nInstitutional  \n\n \n89. \nUndertaking  institutional  reform,  rationalization,  amalgamation,  and  closures  premised \non  cost-effectiveness  and  probability  of  success  will  provide  the  incentives  for  addressing \ninstitutional  weaknesses  for  moving  on  the  continuum  of  sustainable  intermediation.  The \nrestructuring gains will be captured in improved governance, cost savings, and lower transaction \ncosts.  Since  the  reforms  are  being  undertaken  in  the  context  of  a  supportive  policy  and  legal \nframework, they have a reasonable chance of success. Prior commitment to the reform agenda, \nincluding the acceptance of attrition of some entities, will facilitate institutional transformation.  \n\n \n\n90.  While  ensuring  prudent  lending  and  investment  decisions  through  effective  formal \nregulation  of  SCBs  and  DCCBs,  the  Program  will  help  harmonize  and  strengthen  CCS \nregulation. In addition, nonprudential oversight of the vast  network of PACSs  will enhance the \nconfidence  of  the  members,  borrowers,  and  lenders  in  the  PACSs.  However,  the  PACSs  and \nDCCBs  will  only  turnaround  gradually  as  a  result  of  financial  restructuring  and  improved \nrepayment  rates,  cost  reductions  caused  by  rationalization  of  systems  and  procedures,  and \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\n \n\nthrough  enhanced  management \n\ninformation  systems.  The  gradual \nefficiency  gains \ndepoliticization  of  debt  recovery  will  also  improve  portfolio  quality  over  time,  which  will  prompt \ncommercial  banks  to  increase  their  rural  finance  loan  portfolios,  thus  reinforcing  improved \noutreach of rural finance services.  \n \n\nSocial and Poverty \n\n3. \n \n91. \nAt  the  macro  level,  the  Program  supports  the  poverty  reduction  goal  through  greater \naccess  to  affordable  rural  finance  services,  which  in  turn  will  facilitate  better  access  to \nproductive  resources  (e.g.,  farm  inputs,  improved  technologies,  and  rural  infrastructure). \nAccessibility  will  reduce  the  debt  servicing  cost  paid  by  small  and  marginal  farmers  to  the \ninformal  sector,  which  is  often  higher  than  their  earning  capacity  and  results  in  indebtedness. \nThe CCS will not only be able to effectively target the lower segment of the rural finance market, \nbut  also  increase  the  overall  number  of  borrowers.  While  it  is  difficult  to  project  the  volume  of \nbusiness beyond the normal growth trends of the CCS in the PSs, the number of members that \nwould be able to access credit would expand significantly with the increased retail capacity of \nthe CCS. \n \n92. \nCCS reform will increase household incomes through (i) higher returns from farming; (ii) \nincreased  employment  through  diversification  and  new  enterprises,  including  nonagricultural \nactivities  or  expansion  of  existing  ones;  (iii)  higher  responsiveness  to  emerging  rural  nonfarm \nenterprise  opportunities;  (iv)  a  shift  from  irregular,  low-paid  daily  labor  to  more  diversified \nsources  of  employment;  and  (v)  increased  accumulation  of  financial  assets  and,  therefore, \nimproved  risk  management.  Increased  employment  will  come  from  the  high  labor  content  of \ncommercial crops, increased cropping intensities, and increased value addition.  \n \n93. \nAnchored in an overall strategy of inclusive growth, the most significant benefit of CCS \nreform  is  start  of  a  shift  in  the  rural  economy  by  empowering  small  and  marginal  farmers  to \nmeaningfully and substantially participate in, and benefit from, development. The recognition of \nthe CCS as a central institution for rural transformation provides an opportunity for low-income \nhouseholds  to  realize  significant  social  capital  and  equity  gains  in  India\u2019s  hierarchical  social \ncontext.  Restoring  control  of  the  CCS  to  its  members  and  the  incentives  for  improved \ngovernance, transparency, and operational performance is expected to bring major changes in \nthe rural economic landscape. Development of a conducive policy and legal framework for the \nCCS will also strengthen the role of civil society in the rural sector. \n \nRestructuring the CCS into an effective and efficient rural finance mechanism will have \n94. \ndirect and indirect positive social benefits. The transformation of the CCS into genuine member-\nowned and controlled entities implies that internally the CCS will increasingly be driven by the \npriorities  of  its  members.  Individual  CCS  institutions  will  thus  be  more  self-reliant  and \nautonomous,  and  more  capable  of  articulating  local  issues,  mobilizing  local  resources, \nenhancing bargaining power for the local communities, widening options for income-generating \nactivities, and enhancing local control over factors of production without increasing risks for the \npoor. These trends will facilitate integration of the rural poor into the mainstream economy, and \nhelp build defense mechanisms against poverty at household, group, and village levels, which \nwill  be  particularly  important  for  women.  About  20%  of  the  SHGs  are  promoted,  guided,  and \nfinanced  by  banks,  and  72%  are  promoted  and  guided  by  the  Government  and  other  formal \nagencies,  such  as  DCCBs,  and  financed  by  banks  (further  details  are  in  Appendix  11).  The \nremaining  8%  are  promoted  by  NGOs  and  financed  by  banks.  By  reforming  the  CCS,  more \nSHGs and, therefore, more female borrowers will have access to rural finance services.  \n \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nRisks   \n\n \n95. \nAn  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  reforms  identified  no  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  The  poverty  and  social  assessment \n(Appendix 11) determined that no persons will be negatively affected in terms of ADB\u2019s policies \non involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. The Program is category C in all three areas. \n \nB.  \n \n96. \nCCS  reform  entails  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory,  governance,  and \ninstitutional  issues  exacerbated  by  longstanding  political  interference.  At  the  macro  level,  the \nconsensus, as well as the progress, on the reform agenda is driven by the growing recognition \nby stakeholders of the significance of improving rural living standards where most people live. \nWhile  this  is  the  most  effective  measure  to  ensure  sustained  reform  commitment  at  all  levels, \nachieving  expected  impacts  will  depend  on  several  assumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying \ndegrees of risk. Mitigation measures are being put in place where feasible and appropriate. \n \n97. \nReform  Commitment.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  successful  track  record  in  reforming \nthe commercial banks and RRBs, there are significant risks in dealing with the CCS particularly \nthe  likelihood  that  PSs  may  waver  in  their  commitment  to  reform.  In  addition,  the  reform \nhierarchy  involving  actors  all  the  way  down  to  the  grassroots  level  could  also  slow  the \nmomentum of reforms. These risks are dealt with in part by front loading the conditions relating \nto  the  policy  reform  and  implementation  framework,  upfront  legal  assurances,  and  phased \nfinancial  assistance.  The  Program  enables  substitution,  within \nfirst  6  months  of \nimplementation,  of  a  PS  by  any  other  state  that  shows  higher  commitment  to  and  faster \nprogress in implementing reforms.  \n \n98. \nReform  Harmonization.  Intensive  efforts  to  harmonize  policies  that  affect  the  CCS \nunderscore the different paradigms for the CCS held by  Government and the PSs. Sustaining \nthis convergence, particularly on the part of PSs, requires clear priorities as well as deft political \nmanagement  to  balance  the  urgent  need  to  reform  the  CCS  with  the  need  to  maintain  social \nstability, especially in resource-poor areas. The Government has stepped in to mitigate the risks \nto the reform process by addressing urgent sociopolitical issues, including a recent package of \nmeasures to ameliorate farmer distress.  \n \n99. \nEligibility  Criteria.  In  a  reform  of  this  scale,  some  attrition  is  expected.  Arriving  at  a \nconsensus on the reform agenda necessitated the inclusion of entities with a repayment level of \n30% as eligible for support under the Program. While some of these PACSs may not be able to \nturn around, the rationale for including them has been that (i) many of the problems in the CCS \nresult  directly  from  political  interference  and,  therefore,  a  fundamental  shift  in  the  operating \nenvironment provides a much better chance of revival than financial performance may suggest; \nand  (ii)  the  spatial  distribution  of  poorly  performing  PACSs  in  some  cases  is  concentrated  in \ndefined areas, and as such excluding them would mean winding down the CCS in parts of the \ncountry. Support for this category of PACSs under the Program is phased and contingent upon \nmeeting performance benchmarks. Even factoring in the attrition of some of these PACSs, the \nCCS reform as currently structured would still provide substantial benefits under a conservative \n10%  annual  growth  on  disbursements,  thus  decreasing  the  risk  of  reduced  access  to  rural \nfinance services.  \n \n100.  Phasing  of  Support.  The  financial  support  provided  for  cleaning  accumulated  losses \neven  after  completion  of  the  special  audits,  progress  on  legal  enactments  and  institutional \n\nthe \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29 \n\n \n\nreforms poses a moral hazard risk that PSs and recipient CCS institutions will not follow through \non  the  subsequent  reform  and  institutional  restructuring  commitments  or  may  even  renege  on \nprevious reforms. To mitigate this risk, the PSs will contribute financially to CCS reform upfront, \nand  thus  have  an  interest  in  seeing  the  process  move  forward.  The  CCS  reform  cleans  the \naccumulated  losses  only  up  to  FY2004.  The  CCS  institutions,  thereafter,  are  expected  to \nimprove  performance  including  collection  of  past  dues  while  operating  under  an  enhanced \nprudential  regime.  Defining  the  reform  program  as  a  one-time  measure  mitigates  the  moral \nhazard  of  perpetually  supporting  weak  institutions.  In  addition,  other  mitigation  measures  are \nbeing considered, including linking the availability of NABARD refinance to CCS reform.  \n \n101. \nInstitutional  Reforms.  Staff  behavior  could  prove  resistant  to  governance  and \ninstitutional reforms, thereby undermining the expected improvements in performance. Factors \nthat  mitigate  these  risks  include  (i)  upfront  commitment  on  the  governance  framework, \nautonomy, and professionalization of boards; (ii) redefining the institutional mission and vision; \n(iii) reducing cost overheads; and (iv) significant investments in systems and procedures (e.g., \naccounting  and  management  information  systems),  and  human  resource  development.  The \nneed and significance of reforms are being widely publicized. \n \n102. \nImplementation.  Implementation  risk  will  be  minimized  through  engagement  of  an \nindependent  agency  to  assess  reform  implementation.  NABARD  will  provide  the  skills  to \nimplement CCS reform effectively and monitor CCS performance as well as support SLICs and \nDLICs.  NABARD  has  a  nationwide  presence  and  operates  an  extensive  data  collection \nmechanism  for  the  CCS.  The  TA  attached  to  the  Program  will  further  supplement  NABARD \nefforts.  In  addition,  KfW  is  expected  to  provide  substantial  TA  for  implementation  support  and \ncapacity building. These efforts will be further coordinated with other external support for CCS \nreform.  ADB  and  KfW  financial  assistance  will  be  released  in  four  tranches,  which  provides \nconsiderable scope for dialogue with the Government, allows more time for the Government to \naddress any implementation issues, and helps increase stakeholder ownership.  \n \n103.  Complementary Reforms. The complementary reforms (para. 6) may not progress fast \nenough to complement CCS reform. This risk, however, is not considered to be significant given \nthe  political  imperative  for  the  Government  to  improve  rural  conditions  and  the  overarching \nemphasis  on  the  rural  sector  in  government  development  programs.  Important  initiatives  in \nCFMs and agribusiness have also been programmed by ADB and other funding agencies that \nwill help advance the complementary reform agenda. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n104.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  and  will  cause  NABARD,  and  the  PSs  to:  (a)  maintain  the \npolicies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement for the \nProgram,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  for \nthe duration of the Program and subsequently; (b) promptly adopt and implement \nthe  policies  and  take  the  actions  included  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of the Program and subsequently.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  for  the \ncosts  associated  with  CCS  reform  under  the  Program  and  shall,  in  particular, \n\n \n\n\ftransfer  the  counterpart  funds  generated  under  the  Loan,  through  NABARD \nunder  normal  arrangements  for  transferring  external  assistance  to  the  PSs  and \nshall treat such counterpart funds as an additionality to its transfers allocated to \nthe PSs; and (b) all PSs make available on a timely basis, the counterpart funds \nrequired for the Program through timely budget appropriations/ allocations and in \naccordance with relevant MOUs and/or agreements. \n\nThe  Government  and  the  PSs  will  ensure  that  the  reforms  under  the  Program, \nrespective \nincluding \nMOUs/agreements  between  various  agencies  under  the  CCS  reform  package \nare formulated, finalized, and implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nreforms,  and \n\ninstitutional, \n\nlegal  and \n\nfinancial \n\nAs  part  of  the  legal  and  institutional  reforms  and  compliance  of  various  tranche \nreleases,  the  Government  will  ensure  and  cause  the  PSs  to  undertake  the \nnecessary  amendments  referred  to  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  ensure \ntheir implementation in an effective and timely manner. \n\nTowards  timely  compliance  with  the  activities  listed  in  the  development  policy \nletter and the policy matrix, the Government will and will cause NABARD, and the \nPSs under the Program to adhere to the implementation schedule to ensure that \ntranches are released in accordance with the policy matrix.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  CCS  will  have  autonomy  in  all  financial  and \ninternal administrative matters as outlined in the MOUs/respective agreements. \n\nIn case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity \nand  liquidity  of  the  CCS,  ADB  will  be  consulted  immediately  and  a  remedial \naction plan acceptable to ADB prepared. \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  modifications  if  any  in  the  CCS \nreform package in so far as these may impact the Program in any manner. \n\nThe  Government  and  NABARD  will  regularly  exchange  views  and  information \nwith ADB and KfW on any problems and constraints encountered during Program \nimplementation to address any changes and to overcome or mitigate these. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all activities, documents, and enactments under \nthe Program are undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders and their \nfeedback incorporated as appropriate in finalizations; through proper institutional \nmechanisms  in  place  for  communication  and  feedback  on  all  relevant  policy \nactions from stakeholders. \n\nThe Government will take all steps necessary to ensure that relevant enactments \nincluding  amendments  to  existing  laws  under  the  agreements  reached  with  the \nGovernment are (a) undertaken with full stakeholder participation and views thus \nprovided  are  incorporated  as  appropriate;  (b)  tabled  in  the  Parliament/State \nlegislatures,  respectively,  for  consideration  and  enactment  well  in  time  and  in \nsync  with  related  tranche  release  requirements,  and  (c)  brought  into  force,  and \nimplemented effectively. \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f31 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nVIII.

This  paradigm \ncontributed  to  the  wide  institutional  network,  rural  deposit  mobilization,  and  credit  expansion. \nHowever,  the  rural  finance  sector  designed  in  pursuit  of  and  operated  under  this  paradigm  was \ninevitably nonviable. Weak governance exacerbated these problems.  \n \nB.  \n\nFormal Banking and Credit \n\n2. \nThe  institutional  structure  for  rural  finance  comprises  sets  of  institutions  operating  at \nvarious levels. At the policy level, the Government of India (the Government), state governments, \nand  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI),  the  central  bank,  exercise  their  authority  in  defining  and \nimplementing  public  policy  for  rural  credit  and  various  laws  that  govern  the  formal  rural  finance \nsector.  Retail-level  institutions  include  commercial  banks,  regional  rural  banks  (RRB),  the \ncooperative  credit  structure  (CCS),  and  microfinance  institutions1  operating  at  the  state,  district, \nand  local/community  levels  through  their  extensive  branch  network.  At  the  operational  level,  the \napex  rural  finance  institution\u2014the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \n(NABARD)\u2014provides  refinance,  audit  and  supervision,  training,  and  policy  and  operational \nguidance  to  rural  finance  institutions.  The  National  Agricultural  Insurance  Company  and \ncommodity  futures  markets  (CFM)  are  also  integral  to  the  rural  finance  sector.  The  formal  retail \nbanking sector is depicted in Figure A1 (page 38). \n \n\nTable A1.1: Credit and Deposit in Formal Banking System  \n(as of 31 March 2005)a \n\nDeposits\n(Rs billion) Percent \n\nLoans \n\nLoans to \nDeposits \n\n67 \n5 \n3 \n17 \n91 \n\n24 \n0 \n7 \n3 \n34 \n\n62 \n6 \n2 \n18 \n87 \n\n(Rs billion) Percent \n\n16,040 \n1,118 \n706 \n4,065 \n21,931 \n\n10,720 \n988 \n395 \n3,072 \n15,175 \n\nOffices  Percent \n47,688 \n236 \n14,372 \n6,385 \n68,681 \n\nItem \nPublic Sector CBs \nForeign CBs  \nRegional Rural Banks \nPrivate Sector CBs  \nSubtotal CBs \nRural Cooperative \nBanks and Credit \nSocieties \nUrban Cooperative \nBanks \nTotal Formal System \nRuralb \nUrban \nCB = commercial bank. \na Includes both urban and rural sectors. \nb Rural includes network classified by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as semi-urban.  \nSource:  RBI  Quarterly  Banking  Statistics,  March  2006;  and  RBI  Report  on  Trend  and  Progress  of  Banking  in  India  2004\u2013\n2005, Developments in Cooperative Banking (2005).  \n\n199,302 \n167,507 \n31,795 \n\n24,025 \n6,742 \n17,283 \n\n17,350 \n4,542 \n12,808 \n\n121,661 \n8,960 \n\n67 \n88 \n56 \n76 \n69 \n\n100 \n84 \n16 \n\n100 \n28 \n72 \n\n100 \n26 \n74 \n\n89 \n27 \n412 \n\n1,757 \n418 \n\n1,454 \n641 \n\n73 \n67 \n76 \n\n121 \n111 \n\n10 \n2 \n\n61 \n4 \n\n14 \n79 \n\n6 \n3 \n\nLoans per \nOffice \n(Rs million) \n225 \n4,187 \n27 \n481 \n221 \n\n3. \nThe  RBI  conducts  monetary  policy  and  regulates  and  supervises  all  banks.  The  RBI  has \ndelegated  the  off-  and on-site supervision  of  the  CCS  and  RRBs  to  NABARD  (Appendix  2).  The \nstate  governments  also  exercise  supervision  of  the  CCS.  Established  in  2001,  the  Credit \nInformation Bureau of India Limited collects data on consumer and commercial credit in 42 million \nrecords from 50 financial institutions.  \n                                                 \n1  Microfinance institutions refer to the entire range of institutions providing microfinance services whether as a nonbank \n\nfinance company, a mutually aided cooperative society, or nongovernment organization.  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\nC. \n\nRural Banking and Credit  \n\n4. \nCommercial  bank  (rural  branches),  RRBs,  and  CCS  provide  services  to  nearly  90  million \nborrowers  through  a  network  of  more  than  167,000  offices  mobilizing  about  28%  of  India\u2019s \ndeposits  and  providing  26%  of  its  loans.  Table  A1.2  highlights  significant  differences  in  branch \noutreach and target clientele among the different types of service providers. The rural CCS has by \nfar the largest office network and borrowing clientele reaching well over 60 million borrowers with \naverage loans of about $600. On average, a rural branch is only 6.5% of an urban branch in terms \nof loans.  \n\nTable A1.2: India Rural Banking Service Coveragea (as of 31 March 2005) \n\nItem \nRural Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies \nRegional Rural Banks \nCommercial Banks \nTotal Formal Rural Finance Institutions \na The totals may not agree in some cases due to rounding off. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India Quarterly Banking Statistics, March 2006; and Reserve Bank of India (2005). \n\nPercent \n70.0 \n7.0 \n23.0 \n100.0 \n\n1,757.0 \n395.0 \n2,391.0 \n4,543.0 \n\n38.0 \n9.0 \n53.0 \n100.0 \n\n(Rs billion)  Percent \n\nOffices \n(%) \n72.0 \n9.0 \n19.0 \n100.0 \n\nBorrowers \n(million) \n60.3 \n6.1 \n20.2 \n86.6 \n\nCredit \n\nAverage \nLoan Size $\n633.0 \n1,406.0 \n2,573.0 \n1,140.0 \n\n5. \nCommercial  Banks.  Commercial  banks,  in  particular,  public  sector  commercial  banks \n(PSCB) have a large office network to serve the rural economy. Services include deposits which \nprovide rural customers with an investment outlet. With about 20 million borrowers, the commercial \nbanks are key lenders in rural India. The commercial banks provide a wide range of loans at an \naverage  size  of  about  $2,600.  Although  very  substantial  in  volume,  commercial  banks  tend  to \nemphasize  services  to  the  semi-urban  segment  and  upper  and  middle  segments  of  the  rural \nfinance market. However, some private commercial banks have recently successfully established \ninnovative  lending  at  the  village  level  through  (i)  qualified  nongovernment  organizations  with  a \nproven track record, (ii) value chain financing, and (iii) credit card products.  \n\nWith the reforms initiated since the early 1990s, RBI has tightened prudential regulation of \n6. \nthe  banking  sector.  Improved  norms  for  capital  adequacy,  income-recognition,  and  asset \nclassification  led  to  a  realistic  presentation  of  financial  statements  and  a  widening  gap  between \nstrong  and  weak  banks.  The  number  of  private  banks  has  increased  and  the  Government  took \neffective  measures  to  strengthen  independence  and  professionalization  of  PSCBs,  which \ndominate the system. PSCBs may now raise up to 49% of capital from the public. During 2005, the \ncommercial banks reported adequate profitability, capital adequacy, and asset quality.  \n\nTable A1.3: Commercial Banks (as of 31 March 2005) \u2013 Key Indicators  \n(%) \n\nItem \nROA \nCRAR  \nNPL \n\nWeighted  \nAverage \n\n1.0 \n12.2 \n1.2 \n\nBest \n9.6 \n136.9 \n0.0 \n\nWorst \n (2.0) \n1.0 \n41.6 \n\nSBI and \nAffiliates \n\n0.9 \n11.5 \n1.4 \n\nNationalized \nBanks \n0.9 \n12.4 \n1.3 \n\nForeign  \nBanks \n2.1 \n12.6 \n0.8 \n\nPrivate \nBanks \n1.1 \n12.5 \n1.0 \n\nCRAR = Capital to risk assets ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROA = Return on Assets, SBI = State Bank of India.  \nSource: Reserve Bank of India Annual Banking Statistics, March 2006. \n\n7. \nRegional  Rural  Banks.  There  are  196  RRBs  with  14,372  branches  operating  in  the \ncountry.  RRBs  typically  cover  1  to  3  districts.  Established  under  the  RRB  Act,  1976,  the  RRBs \nhave  been  capitalized  by  the  Government  (50%),  the  state  governments  (15%),  and  sponsoring \nPSCBs (35%). RRBs play a limited role on the national scale but are important service providers to \nthe  rural  poor  in  some  states.  RRBs  currently  serve  about  6.6  million  clients  at  an  average  loan \nsize of about $1,400, and an overall share of about 9% of the rural credit market. Compared to the \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ncommercial  banks,  the  RRBs  serve  smaller  customers.  RRBs  tend  to  be  more  active  in  deposit \nmobilization compared to lending with a credit to deposit ratio of 56%.  \n\nTable A1.4: Regional Rural Banks \u2013 Key Financial Performance Indicators  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \n\nEquity to \nTotal \nAssets \n(%) \n\nAssets as \nof Total  \n(%) \n\nDeposits \nto Total \nAssets  \n(%) \n\nLoans to \nTotal \nAssets  \n(%) \n\nNPL Ratio \n(%) \n\nProvisions\nto NPL  \n(%) \n\nNet \nMargin \n(%) \n\nAssets \n(Rs billion) \n\nDeposits \n(Rs billion) \n\nLoans \n(Rs billion)\n\nItem \nState with Largest \nNetwork \nNext Seven States \nAll 26 States \nLowest \nHighest \nNPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: Report of the internal working group on regional rural bank reforms, Reserve Bank of India (2005). \n\n162.0 \n348.8 \n702.9 \n0.2 \n162.0 \n\n130.9 \n275.9 \n563.5 \n0.3 \n130.9 \n\n47.6 \n142.5 \n261.1 \n0.1 \n47.6 \n\n23.0 \n50.0 \n100.0 \n0.0 \n23.0 \n\n10.0 \n7.0 \n8.0 \n4.0 \n22.0 \n\n29.0 \n41.0 \n37.0 \n18.0 \n70.0 \n\n81.0 \n79.0 \n80.0 \n69.0 \n91.0 \n\n17.0 \n12.0 \n13.0 \n4.0 \n74.0 \n\n35.0 \n32.0 \n35.0 \n23.0 \n76.0 \n\n  1.1 \n(0.2) \n0.1 \n(5.7) \n2.4 \n\nThe  limited  area  of  operation,  narrow  client  base,  high  cost  of  servicing  small  accounts, \n8. \nand inadequate skills have considerably weakened the RRBs. In the process, RRBs have drifted \nfrom their core objective of banking with the poor and have accumulated overheads without regard \nto efficiency. During 1995\u20131999, recapitalization support equivalent to $500 million was provided \nalong  with  intensive  institutional  development  support.  As  a  result,  the  asset  quality  of  RRBs \nimproved and the nonperforming assets were halved. During 2004, 156 RRBs earned profits with \n97  having  wiped  off  their  accumulated  losses  and  built  up  collective  reserves  of  $500  million. \nCurrently, consolidation of RRBs in contiguous areas for realizing operating synergies is ongoing. \nWhile  the  overall  institutional  status  of  RRBs  is  improving,  continued  support,  and  human \nresources development assistance are required to consolidate their position.  \n\nRural  Cooperative  Banks.  The  CCS  in  most  states  comprises  separate  delivery \n\n9. \nstructures for long-term credit, and short-term credit.  \n\n10. \nLong-term  CCS  includes  20  state  cooperative  agriculture  and  rural  development  banks \nand  768  primary  cooperative  agricultural  and  rural  development  banks  with  a  network  of  about \n2,000 offices serving about 9 million borrowers. In Andhra Pradesh and four north-eastern states, \nshort-term and long-term  CCS are  merged. The long-term  CCS draws  its resources largely from \nNABARD\u2019s refinance program and also benefits from NABARD\u2019s special liquidity support program. \nDespite  this,  about  two-thirds  of  the  long-term  CCS  entities  reported  losses  during  the  financial \nyear  2004.  Nonperforming  loans  increased  by  4.5%  to  31%  in  2004  and  collection  of  dues  was \nreported at below 44%. Table A1.5 illustrates key performance indicators. Since the classification \nof  risk  assets  does  not  follow  standards  applicable  for  banks,  loss  provisions  are  likely  to  be \ninadequate. \n\nTable A1.5: Performance of the Long-term Cooperative Credit Structure  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \n\nEntities \nReporting \nProfit \n(%) \n53.0 \n37.0 \n\n \nItem \nSCARDBs \nPCARDBs \nNPL = nonperforming loan, PCARDB = primary cooperative agricultural and rural development bank, SCARDB = state \ncooperative agriculture and rural development bank. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. 2005.

The  Committee  has \nsubmitted a report, which is currently under consideration by the Government. The long-term CCS \nis exposed to severe governance and accountability issues and there are doubts as to whether the \nparallel existence of both the long- and short-term CCS is justified.  \n\n12. \nShort-term  Credit  Cooperatives.  The  short-term  CCS  is  a  federated  structure  of  three \ntiers,  including  state  cooperative  banks  (SCB)  as  the  apex-body  in  the  state,  district  central \ncooperative banks (DCCB) federated to the SCB, and primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) \nat the village-level federated to the respective DCCBs. The short-term CCS maintains the largest \ncredit  network  in  India  representing  about  two-thirds  of  the  offices  and  serving  120  million \nmembers,  including  51  million  or  70%  of  rural  borrowers  in  March  2004.  The  short-term  CCS \nprovides one-third of formal rural credit.2  \n\n13. \nThe  SCBs  mobilize  resources  and  intermediate  surpluses  to  provide  financial  support  to \nthe  DCCBs,  while  serving  a  few  larger  state-level  cooperatives  and  agro-businesses.  Besides \nSCBs\u2019  funding,  the  DCCBs  draw  significant  customer  deposits  through  their  extensive  branch \nnetwork.  The  PACSs  are  the  DCCBs\u2019  primary  borrowers.  Similar  to  the  SCBs,  DCCBs  provide \ndirect lending to a few large cooperatives and private agro-businesses at the district level. While \nthe  countrywide  CCS  at  the  SCB  and  DCCB  levels  draws  major  resources  from  deposits,  some \nstates rely in a major way on borrowings from NABARD. The state governments own equity in the \nshort-term CCS in selected states and entities.  \n\nTable A1.6: Performance of the Short-term Cooperative Credit Structure  \n(As of 31 March 2004)  \n\nLosses/ \nEquity \n(%) \n\nEntities \nReporting \nProfit  \n(%) \n87.0 \n72.0 \n51.0 \n\nItem \nSCBs \nDCCBs \nPACSs \n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, NPL = nonperforming loan, PACS = primary agricultural credit society, \nSCB = state cooperative bank. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India. 2005.

Statutory  audits \nrate the SCBs as being satisfactory, while audits of DCCBs identified substantial issues, including \nlack of office automation and poor record keeping. Audits rate PACSs as being largely insufficient. \nThe  poor  audit  results  emphasize  the  need  to  establish  a  comprehensive  audit  system  and \nautomation to support rigorous internal and off-site controls. While SCBs are reportedly profitable, \nthe  DCCBs,  the  backbone  of  the  short-term  system,  report  a  substantial  erosion  of  equity  and \ndeposits resulting from weak loan management in its own offices and the PACSs as their primary \nclients.  As  presented  in  Table  A1.6,  nonperforming  loans  are  at  alarming  levels  and  the \nweaknesses  of  the  PACSs  at  the  grassroots  level  have  had  a  cascading  effect  over  the  whole \nshort-term CCS. \n\nD. \n\nOther Rural Finance Sector Institutions  \n\nCommodity  Futures  Markets.  CFMs  in  India  date  back  from  1875  and  comprise  24 \n15. \ncommodity exchanges, of which three are multi-commodity exchanges with online trading systems \nand  the  remaining  are  single  commodity  exchanges.  However,  commodity-wise  segmentation, \n\n                                                 \n2  Appendix 3 describes the potential outreach and financial performance of the various tiers in the participating states. \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nregional  dispersal,  and  separate  spot  and  forward  markets  in  commodities  has  impeded  better \nprice realization and marketing efficiency for agricultural produce. Addressing these concerns will \nrequire  effective  market  regulation  and  strengthening  of  the  entire  downstream  systems  for \nenhancing  the  participation  of  small  rural  producers  in  CFMs  and  facilitating  remunerative  prices \nfor them.  \n \n16. \nRisk Mitigation. The ongoing National Agricultural Insurance Scheme provides insurance \ncover  for  food  crops,  oilseeds,  and  selected  annual  commercial  crops.  Indebted  farmers  (i.e., \nborrowers  of  seasonal agricultural loans)  are  covered  on  a  compulsory  basis,  while  nonindebted \nfarmers may be covered on a voluntary basis. So far, the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme \nhas  only  reached  about  18  million,  mainly  small  farms,  out  of  a  total  of  about  120  million  farms, \nand has experienced recurring losses. Currently, the World Bank is providing technical support to \ngradually increase coverage of agricultural insurance.  \n \nE. \n\nAgriculture Sector  \n\n \nAgricultural policies have historically sought to ensure self-sufficiency in wheat and rice, the \n17. \nmain  staple  grains,  which  continue  to  the  present  day  even  though  grain  production  has  been \nmore than enough to satisfy domestic demand for quite some time. The \u201cfood subsidy\u201d covers the \ncost  of  price  support,  distribution,  and  storage  of  wheat  and  rice,  and  the  total  cost  remains  the \nequivalent of about 5% of annual government expenditure. The Government also subsidizes other \nfarm  inputs,  including  fertilizer,  power,  and  irrigation  water,  pushing  the  total  subsidy  bill  for \nagriculture much higher. \n\n \nThe  large  subsidy  cost  and  its  fiscal  impact  have  dampened  public  investment  in \n18. \nagriculture for more than a decade. Although private investment has grown rapidly, it still remains \nvery small in aggregate terms, amounting to only about 1.5% of sector output, compared to about \n25% for the entire economy. Private investment in agriculture has been discouraged by an array of \nmarket regulations and licensing requirements that, among others, have restricted private storage \nand  movement  of  major  agricultural  commodities,  and  limited  the  scale  of  food  processing  and \nvalue  addition.  Weak  incentives  have  also  resulted  in  significant  underinvestment  in  agricultural \nmarketing, which has created highly fragmented marketing chains and inhibited vertical integration \nof production and processing. The resulting market inefficiency causes farmers to receive smaller \nshares of the final consumer price, thus reducing overall returns from farming. \n \n19. \nPolicies  that  have  long  inhibited  private  investment  incentives  and  fragmented  the \nmarketing system are beginning to be changed. The most significant changes thus far have been \nin market access, including the liberalization of import policies completed in 2001 as required by \nthe  World  Trade  Organization.  Restrictions  on  food  imports  that  taxed  local  producers  and \nprecluded competitive export industries began to decline in the 1990s. These reforms have helped \nto stimulate agricultural trade, but also exposed inefficiencies in the domestic marketing system. In \nresponse,  the  Government  and  several  state  governments  have  begun  to  lift  longstanding \nrestrictions  that  impede  private  storage  and  interstate  movement  of  grain  and  other  essential \ncommodities.  Licenses  are  no  longer  needed  to  establish  food  processing  operations,  and \nregulations  restricting  their  size  have  mostly  been  eliminated.  In  addition,  foreign  investment  in \nfood  processing  and  marketing  ventures  (excluding  retail)  is  now  automatically  approved  for \ninvestments up to 51% of the project cost.  \n \nOther  key  changes  underway  that  improve  the  investment  environment  include  the \n20. \nintroduction  of  selective  exemptions  to  the  highly  restrictive  Agricultural  Produce  Marketing \nCommittee Act to facilitate contract farming arrangements. With the agriculture sector dominated \nby large numbers of small farmers, food processors typically have difficulty procuring agricultural \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n37 \n\nproduce  for  their  operations.  Contract  farming  is  expanding  rapidly  and  has  proven  to  be \nsuccessful  in  reducing  marketing  risks  faced  by  both  buyers  and  sellers  and  increasing  farmers\u2019 \nincomes. However, such arrangements are still not recognized or protected by current laws. Such \npractices  could  expand  more  rapidly  with  stronger  legal  protections  in  place,  particularly \nwidespread  adoption  of  the  model  amendment  to  the  Agricultural  Produce  Marketing  Committee \nAct, which directly allows private sector participation in agricultural marketing. \n \n21. \nA  related  set  of  reforms  now  under  consideration  involve  changes  in  laws  regulating  the \nleasing  of  agricultural  land.  At  present,  inadequate  protection  for  both  lessors  and  lessees  limits \nthe  use  of  land  rentals  to  assemble  larger  and  potentially  more  efficient  land  holdings.  Another \nexpected  reform  is  the  streamlining  of  food  safety  laws  and  their  alignment  with  international \nstandards.  A  major  overhaul  of  the  food  law  aimed  at  consolidation  of  responsibilities  and \njurisdiction,  as  well  as  reorientation  toward  international  standards,  is  now  underway,  although \nthere is no set time frame for its completion.  \n \nF. \n \nThe rural finance sector institutions to varying degrees are affected by weak governance, \n22. \ninadequate autonomy, regulatory forbearance and overlaps, poor portfolio quality, and institutional \ncapacity constraints. The lack of robust rural finance markets is reflected in a number of indicators, \nincluding declining agricultural growth, farmer distress, and growing rural-urban disparities. As part \nof the ongoing financial liberalization, the reform of the commercial banks and the RRBs is yielding \npositive  results.  However,  substantive  reforms  of  the  CCS  could  not  be  implemented  in  view  of \ndiffering  perceptions  on  the  role  of  the  CCS.  Nevertheless,  the  access  that  the  CCS  provides  to \nthe  rural  households  underlies  its  significance,  particularly  when  commercial  banks  are \ninstitutionally  appropriate  for  serving  the  middle  and  upper  market  segments  and  RRBs  are  also \nmoving upmarket.  \n \n23. \ninitiated in a phased manner to fundamentally address the underlying causes of weakness. \n \n\nIn the context of Government\u2019s endeavor to reform the CCS, the following will need to be \n\nRural Finance Sector Reforms  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPolicy:  A  policy  framework  that  enables  the  CCS  to  operate  with  autonomy  in \nbusiness decisions and without interference in collection of receivables.  \nOwnership: The CCS, as member-based institution, must serve the interests of the \nmembers  and  be  insulated  from  state  government  interventions  and  nonfinancial \ncontrols.  \nGovernance:  Governance  standards  applied  to  commercial  banks  must  be \nmainstreamed  in  the  CCS  to  ensure  appropriate  fiduciary  prudence  in  this  vast \nnetwork. \nRegulation: Autonomy of CCS must accompany effective regulation and enhanced \nprudential norms that eliminate regulatory forbearance and overlaps. \nInstitutional:  Systems  and  procedures  in  the  CCS  need  to  reflect  the  successful \ninstitutional practices adopted for cost-effective service delivery.  \nFinancial  Restructuring:  The  CCS,  with  probability  of  turnaround,  needs  to  be \nfinancially restructured to resume operations under the new paradigm.  \n\n24. \nConsidering  the  multitude  of  deep-seated  problems,  changes  can  be  expected  only  over \nthe  medium  term  and,  therefore,  priorities  need  to  be  decided  for  phasing  and  sequencing  of \ninterventions. The prevailing political economy requires that reforms be phased in order to mitigate \ndisruptions,  if  any,  in  service  delivery  and  corresponding  contingency  measures,  wherever \nrequired. However, in order to succeed, the CCS reforms must frontload policy, legal, regulatory, \nand governance reforms and apply core principles of governance and accountability as eligibility \ncriteria. In addition, benchmarking with tangible performance indicators should be applied. Overall, \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nthe  CCS  will  also  need  to  proactively  enhance  linkages  with  the  self-help  groups  wherever \npossible  to  pool  its  efforts  with  those  of  the  nongovernment  organizations.  It  is  natural  for  major \nreform initiatives, such as that envisaged for the CCS, to result in some attrition.  \n \n25. \nInitiation  of  CCS  reforms  in  isolation  would  lead  to  sub-optimal  results.  The  impact  of \nrobust rural finance markets can be fully realized only if accompanied with effective risk mitigation, \nCFMs,  and  secured  transaction  reforms.  While  the  Asian  Development  Bank  is  helping  the \nGovernment in CFM and secured transactions reforms, the World Bank is assisting in enhancing \nthe  coverage  of  risk  mitigation.  Along  with  the  evolving  framework  for  commercializing  the \nagriculture sector (paras. 17\u201321), these constitute elements for a favorable CCS reform outcome \nand impacts.  \n \n\nFigure A1: Formal Retail Banking Sector \n\nRural \n\nSCBs (31) \n\nLT Structure \n\nUrban (2,015) \n\nST Structure  \n\nSCARDBs (20)\n\nDCCBs \n(368) \n\nUrban Branches \n(10,715) \n\nMetropolitan \nBranches (8,664) \n\nCooperative Credit \nStructure \n\nUrban Branches \n(580)  \n\nSemi Urban Branches \n(14,813) \n\nRegional Rural Banks \n(196) \n\nScheduled Commercial \nBanks (98) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDCCB  =  district  central  cooperative  bank,  LT  =  long-term,  PACS  =  primary  agricultural  credit  society,  PCARDB  = \nprimary  cooperative  agriculture  and  rural  development  bank,  SCARDB  =  state  cooperative  agriculture  and  rural \n \ndevelopment bank, SCB = state cooperative bank, ST = short-term. \n \nNote: Commercial banks include 94 scheduled commercial banks and 4 non-scheduled commercial banks. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\nDepositors and Borrowers \n\nSemi Urban \nBranches (2,422)  \n\nRural Branches \n(32,244) \n\nRural Branches \n(11,370) \n\nPCARDBs \n(768)\n\nBranches \n(887)\n\nBranches \n(847) \n\nBranches \n(1,091)\n\nBranches \n(12,652) \n\nPACSs \n(105,735) \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nTHE NATIONAL BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT  \n \n\n1. \nMandate.  Established  in  1982  through  an  act  of  Parliament,  the  National  Bank  for \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development\u2019s  (NABARD)  mandate  is  to  promote  development  of \nagriculture and the rural economy, and improve the livelihood of farmers and small businesses \nin rural India. NABARD fulfills its mandate through (i) refinance (both short and long term), (ii) \ntraining,  (iii)  funding  special  rural  development  programs,  and  (iv)  surveillance  of  the \ncooperative credit structure (CCS) and regional rural banks (RRB). \n\n2. \nOwnership  and  Management  Oversight.  Owned  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI) \n(72.5%)  and  the  Government  of  India  (Government)  (27.5%),  NABARD  is  overseen  by  an  11 \nmember board chaired by a full time chairman, and represented by a deputy governor, RBI; joint \nsecretary  Ministry  of  Finance,  Banking  Division;  secretaries  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment; high-level officials from two state governments; two private sector members; one \nfrom  academia;  and  the  managing  director  of  NABARD.  The  Board  has  established  four \ncommittees  to  oversee  the  operations  of  the  bank  in  (i)  executive  matters,  (ii)  project  (credit) \nrural  infrastructure  schemes,  (iii)  audit,  and  (iv)  risk  management.  The  committees  are \ncomposed of board members, and the chairman heads, all, except the audit committee.  \n\n3. \nOrganization,  Management,  and  Staffing.  Headquartered  in  Mumbai,  NABARD  has \nregional  offices  in  each  state,  and  covers  83%  of  all  districts  through  its  extensive  branch \nnetwork with 5,230 staff. The management team is composed of the managing director and five \nexecutive directors. NABARD\u2019s headquarters is composed of 28 departments headed by chief \ngeneral  managers,  which  can  be  broadly  classified  according  to  the  following  functions:  (i) \nplanning,  policy,  and  research;  (ii)  credit;  (iii)  institutional  development,  monitoring,  and \nsurveillance; (iv) accounting, audit, finance, legal, and information technology; (v) administration \nand  human  resources;  and  (vi)  public  relations  and  company  secretariat.  The  regional  offices \nare chaired by a chief general manager and mirror the functions at headquarters. \n\nOperations.1  Consistent  with  its  mandate,  lending  (refinance)  to  the  CCS,  RRBs,  and \n4. \ncommercial  banks  constitute  about  three  quarters  of  NABARD\u2019s  outstanding  loans.  The \nrefinance portfolio grew 11% slightly exceeding overall growth of assets in financial years 2004 \nand  2005.  About  three-fourths  of  the  refinancing  is  at  tenures  exceeding  1  year.  About  4%  of \nloans now constitute lending to distressed state cooperative banks, which underscore the need \nfor comprehensive CCS reforms. The significance of the CCS in NABARD\u2019s refinance dropped \nover  the  last  3  years  and  that  of  commercial  banks  increased.  NABARD\u2019s  loan  portfolio  also \nincludes 26% loans for special projects, which are lent directly to state governments.  \n\n5. \nThe bulk of NABARD\u2019s lending is guaranteed by the Government and state governments \nand  risk  weighted  assets  constitute  only  40%  of  its  overall  assets.  However,  risk  weighted \nassets  increased  by  an  annual  rate  of  20%  during  financial  years  2004  and  2005,  double  the \ngrowth  of  total  assets,  and  may  indicate  a  shift  in  NABARD\u2019s  lending  policies.  Unlike \ncommercial  banks,  NABARD  has  no  classified  loans,  which  reflect  the  underlying  government \nguarantees. NABARD recently introduced lending at its own risk, which constitutes 0.34% of its \nloan  portfolio.  NABARD\u2019s  10  largest  borrowers  absorb  30%  of  its  assets  either  through  direct \nexposures to state governments, or state-owned or -supported entities. Exposure to the states \nof  Andhra  Pradesh,  Punjab,  and  Madhya  Pradesh  constitutes  21%  of  assets.  NABARD  holds \n5% of total assets in cash and bank deposits. As a result of its predominant long-term funding, \nNABARD could invest 3% of its assets in high interest bearing government bonds.  \n\n                                                 \n1  NABARD\u2019s financial year (April\u2013March) coincides with the Government\u2019s fiscal year. Unless otherwise stated, the \n\nfigures indicated in this Appendix refer to the status as on 31 March 2006 for the financial year 2005.  \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nConsistent with its role as an apex bank, the lending limits under NABARD\u2019s refinance \n6. \nprograms  are  based  on  internal  assessment  of  the  soundness  of  participating  banks  and  the \ngovernment  guarantees.  NABARD  established  a  board  committee  on  risk  management  to \nintroduce  systems  and  processes  for  improving  its  risk  management  systems  and  internal \ncontrols  in  line  with  the  reforms  taking  place  at  the  commercial  banks.  Under  Government \ndirectives, NABARD\u2019s loan pricing is uniform for credit products and administrative cost, and risk \ncriteria  do  not  play  a  role  in  pricing.  When  the  Government  sets  interest  rates  of  NABARD\u2019s \nprograms below market rates, it provides the requisite support from its budget.  \n\n7. \nFunding.  NABARD\u2019s  equity  and  quasi-equity  constitute  a  solid  9%  of  its  total  balance \nsheet  and  almost  one-fourth  of  its  balance  sheet  constitutes  special  development  funds. \nDeposits  of  banks  constitute  21%  of  NABARD\u2019s  balance  sheet,  and  bonds  and  debentures \n(mostly at favorable tax or regulatory terms) witnessed a strong growth during the last 3 years \nand now amount to 31% of its funding. Borrowing has declined as a source of funds; however, \nlow cost borrowing from the RBI remains significant.  \n\nPrudential  Supervision.  Consistent  with  Article  35(6)  of  the  Banking  Regulation  Act, \n8. \n1949,  RBI  delegated  the  supervisory  powers  over  RRBs  and  the  CCS  to  NABARD.  However, \nthe  prerogative  of  licensing  remains  with  the  RBI.  At  its  headquarters,  a  supervision  and \ninspection department is responsible for off- and on-site surveillance of the RRBs and the CCS, \nwhile  on-site  inspections  are  de  facto  carried  out  by  NABARD\u2019s  regional  offices.  NABARD \nreports  that  overall,  416  banks  (including  296  CCS  institutions)  have  been  inspected.  About \n20% of SCBs, and one-third of district central cooperative banks, were identified with significant \nerosion of capital and deposits as a result of large nonperforming loans.  \n\n9. \nTraining  and  Capacity  Building.  The  institutional  development  department  supports \nthe  RRBs  and  the  CCS  through  targeted  training  and  capacity  building  programs.  NABARD \noperates six training facilities for the purpose. Training is also supported by the regional offices. \nThe institutional development department formulates policies and provides recommendations on \nbranch  licensing,  appointment  of  senior  staff,  audit,  and  human  resource  issues  in  RRBs  and \nCCS.  It  conducts  performance  reviews  of  RRBs  and  CCS  and  also  (i)  administers  the \nCooperative Development Fund for providing financial support for institutional building, and (ii) \nmonitors the Development Action Plans (DAP). \n\n10. \nDAPs are implemented nationwide to facilitate the turnaround of CCS entities into viable \ninstitutions. The performance obligations (financial, operational, and efficiency indicators) arising \nout  of  DAPs  are  formalized  as  deliverables  between  NABARD  and  the  apex  cooperative \nstructures. The apex structures, in turn, develop DAPs and agree on performance targets with \ntheir  respective  lower  tiers.  This  process  extends  up  to  the  level  of  primary  agricultural  credit \nsocieties. While the DAP has been institutionalized within the CCS, the outcome has not been \npositive in view of the longstanding policy, legal, and governance issues in the CCS.  \n\n11. \nFinancial Performance. NABARD reported a decline in revenues, essentially in interest \nrevenues on loans over the last 2 years, which partly reflect a drop in interest rates. This decline \nwas  only  partly  matched  by  a  simultaneous  reduction  in  interest  costs  and  the  net  interest \nmargin  dropped  significantly  from  90  to  70  basis  points  over  2005.  The  high  returns  on \ngovernment bonds (44 basis points above average revenue on interest bearing assets) and low \ncost of borrowing from RBI (24 basis point below average cost of funding) helped mitigate this \nadverse impact. While the gearing ratio of 11:4 (debt to equity) appears high, the real impact is \nsubstantially reduced by the high level of guarantees that support NABARD\u2019s operations.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nAbout  two-thirds  of  NABARD\u2019s  loans  mature  within  3  years.  Benefiting  from  long-term \n12. \nresources  provided  by  the  Government  and  foreign  donors  and  to  a  lesser  extent  market \nborrowings, NABARD\u2019s liabilities beyond tenure of 7 years are significant and largely exceed its \ncorresponding loan exposure at the same tenor. Typically, NABARD lends the funds in multiple \ncycles.  NABARD  is  only  marginally  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk,  which  is  mitigated  by \nGovernment  cover  or  through  cross  currency  swaps.

As  the  apex  rural  finance  agency,  NABARD \nprovided  the  analytical  base  for  the  task  force  on  revitalizing  the  CCS  and  significantly \ncontributed  to  the  consensus  building  on  the  CCS  reform  agenda.  On  the  acceptance  of  task \nforce  recommendations,  NABARD  set  up  the  Department  for  Cooperative  Revitalization  and \nReforms  at  its  headquarters  to  provide  focused  attention  to  CCS  reforms  by  drawing  on \nresources  of  its  supervision,  institutional  development,  training,  and  refinance  departments. \nNABARD  assumes  significant  direct  responsibility  for  CCS  reform  especially  on  institutional \ndevelopment  and  monitoring  as  a  co-signatory  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  and  the  state  governments.  NABARD  also  provides  support  to  the  National \nImplementation and Monitoring Committee in coordinating nationwide CCS reforms. In addition, \nwith  state  and  district  level  presence,  NABARD  is  expected  to  provide  resource  and  technical \nsupport \nimplementation \ncommittees to be established for CCS reforms. Ongoing DAPs are expected to be adapted for \nCCS reform monitoring.  \n\nimplementation  committees  and  district-level \n\nthe  state-level \n\nto \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR \n(as of 30 August 2006) \n\n \n\nA. \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources \nProjects \n\nFinancial Sector Program  \n1549/50/51  Housing Finance (National Housing Bank) \n\n1759 \n1761 \n\nHousing Finance II \u2013 National Housing Bank \nHousing Finance II \u2013 ICICI Bank \n\n \nLoan No. \n1208 \n\n \n\n \nTA No. \n3732 \n3739 \n\n \nProject Name \n\nAssessing the Role of Mortgage-backed Securities \nImpact on Poverty Reduction of Financial Sector Policies \nand Reforms \nSecured Transactions Reform \nDeveloping the Enabling Environment for the Structuring of \nAsset Reconstruction Companies in India \nReform of the Mutual Funds Industry \nDemutualization and Consolidation of Indian Stock \nExchange \nRegulation and Supervision of Derivative Instruments \nPension Reforms for the Unorganized Sector \nRural Finance Sector Restructuring and Development \nState-level Pension Reforms \nA Study on the Development of an Agency to Facilitate \nIssuance of Residential Mortgage-backed Securities \nStrengthening Commodities Futures Markets \n\n3866 \n3943 \n\n4010 \n4202 \n\n4203 \n4226 \n4247 \n4548 \n4569 \n\n4811 \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n300 \n100 \n40 \n80 \n\n \nType  \nAD \nAD \n\nAD \nAD \n\nAD \nAD \n\nAD \nAD \nPP \nAD \nAD \n\nAmount \n($) \n150,000 \n150,000 \n\n500,000 \n800,000 \n\n800,000 \n150,000 \n\n150,000 \n1,000,000 \n1,000,000 \n750,000 \n250,000 \n\nDate \nApproved \n15 Dec 1992  \n25 Sep 1997 \n21 Sep 2000 \n21 Sep 2000 \n\nDate \nApproved \n2 Oct 2001 \n11 Oct 2001 \n\n21 May 2002 \n22 Oct 2002 \n\n4 Dec 2002 \n21 Oct 2003 \n\n22 Oct 2003 \n25 Nov 2003 \n12 Dec 2003 \n23 Dec 2004 \n25 Feb 2005 \n\nA&O \n\n1,000,000 \n\n21 Aug 2006 \n\nThe World Bank Groupa \n\nAD = advisory, A&O = advisory and operational, PP = project preparatory, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \nB. \n \nProject Name \nNational Cooperative Development Corporation Project \nAgriculture Refinance and Development Corporation Credit Project \nIndustrial Finance and Technical Assistance Project \nSME Financing and Development \n\n \nType \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n220 \n375 \n360 \n120 \n\nDate \nApproved \n19 Jun 1984 \n25 Feb 1986 \n31 Mar 1988 \n30 Nov 2004 \n\nOther Funding Sourcesa \n\nIBRD = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IDA = International Development Association, SME = \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprise. \na Projects after 1980. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \nC. \nProject Name \nCapitalization of Rural District Associations of Savings and Credit Groups \nSEWA-Bank: Capitalization of Rural Financial Intermediaries \nSIDBI-III: Environmental Protection \nSIDBI-IV: Environmental Protection \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility \nNABARD X - Credit Line for Nonfarm Sector \n\nAmount (million) \n\u20ac4.09 \n\u20ac4.00 \n\u20ac7.57 \n\nAgency \nKfW \nKfW \nKfW \nKfW \nKfW \nKfW \n\n  \u20ac54.00 \n\n\u20ac43.50 + \u20ac1.00 (TA) \n\n\u20ac40.00  (Credit  line)  + \n\nSIDBI: Financing and Development of Small and Medium Enterprises \nNABARD: Rural Finance Program \n\nGTZ \nGTZ \n\nKfW = German Bank for Reconstruction and Development, GTZ = German Technical Cooperation Agency, NABARD = \nNational  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  SEWA  =  Self-employed  Women\u2019s  Association,  SIDBI  =  Small \nIndustries Development Bank of India, TA = technical assistance. \na only recent major interventions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\n\u20ac1.20 (TA) \n\u20ac5.00 \n\u20ac4.70 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER  \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n43 \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \nObjectives \n\nA nationwide \npolicy \nframework for \nstrengthening \nthe short- \nterm \ncooperative \ncredit \nstructure \n(CCS) is \nadopted  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPOLICY MATRIX \n \n\n \nFirst Tranche \n($250million) \n\nSecond Tranche \n(within 12 months of the First \nTranche) \n($250-million) \n\nThird Tranche \n(Within 12 months of the Second \nTranche) \n($300 million) \n\nFourth Tranche \n(Within 12 months of \nthe third Tranche) \n($200 million) \n\n(i) \n\nEstablishing a Policy Reform and Implementation Framework  \n\n4\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nThe Task Force of the Government of India \n(the Government) undertakes a review of \nthe performance of the CCS\u2014comprising \nthe state cooperative banks (SCBs), district \ncentral cooperative banks (DCCBs), and \nPrimary Agricultural Credit Societies \n(PACSs) and develops a CCS reform \nframework.

Per \ncapita  income  in  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra  largely  exceed  the  national  average,  while  that  for \nMadhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Rajasthan are substantially below. Except for Maharashtra, where \nliteracy exceeds the national average by 12% points, overall literacy in the other PSs is near the \nnational  average.  However,  a  substantial  divide  exists  between  male  and  female  literacy.  In \nparticular, in Rajasthan, male literacy exceeds that of females by 30% points. Literacy in the rural \nareas  of  most  of  the  PSs  is  slightly  below  the  national  average.  A  substantial  portion  of  India\u2019s \npopulation  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  Compared  to  the  national  average,  poverty  is  more \npronounced in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. The PSs\u2019 characteristics underline the importance of \nwell  functioning  rural  finance  institutions,  especially  the  cooperative  credit  structure  (CCS)  that \nhas very substantial coverage at the grassroots level. \n\nTable A6.1: Social and Demographic Indicators \u2013 India and Participating States \n\n \nIndices \n\n \nIndia  \n\nAndhra \nPradesh  \n\n \nGujarat \n\nMaha- \nrashtra \n\nMadhya \nPradesh \n\n \nOrissa \n\nRajas-\nthan \n\nPopulation (million) \nRural Population (% of total) \nCooperative Members (million) \nNumber of Districts \nNumber of Villages \nGDP per capita (Rs) \nGDP per capita in % of India \nPopulation below Poverty Line (%)a \nHuman Development Index 2001 \nLiteracy Rate (%) \nMale Literacy Rate (%) \nFemale Literacy Rate (%) \nRural Literacy Rate (%) \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na     The Planning Commission defines the poverty line as a per capita monthly expenditure of Rs49 in rural and Rs57 in urban areas at \n1973\u201374  prices.

The  short-term  CCS  is  organized  into  three  tiers  including  state \ncooperative  banks  (SCB),  district  central  cooperative  banks  (DCCB),  and  PACSs  at  the  village \nlevel.1  While  the  India-wide  CCS  at  the  SCB  and  DCCB  levels  draws  major  resources  from \ndeposits, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa rely in a major way on borrowings from the National Bank \nfor  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD).  PACSs  are  not  licensed  as  banks  and \nprohibited  from  deposit  taking.  However,  laws  of  some  PSs  allow  PACSs  to  operate  as  mini \nbanks.  While  SCBs  and  DCCBs  are  to  supervise  the  lower  tiers  of  the  CCS,  inadequate \nresources and lack of automation make it currently impossible to fulfill this mandate. Table A6.2 \nillustrates the structure and size of the CCS in the PSs. \n\n                                                 \n1  Andhra  Pradesh  cooperative  credit  structure  provides  both  short-term  and  long-term  credit  under  one  institutional \n\n \n \n\nstructure. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAndhra \nPradesh  \n\n \nIndia  \n \n\n \nMadhya \nPradesh \n\nTable A6.2: Structure and Size of the Cooperative Credit Structure (as of 31 March 2004)a \n           in Rs billion \n  \n \nItem  \nSCB Number \nAssets \nDeposits \nBorrowings \nDCCBs Number \nAssets \nDeposits \nBorrowings \nPACSsb number \nTotal Assets \nDeposits \nBorrowings \n\n1 \n24 \n11 \n10 \n27 \n41 \n23 \n13 \n5,252 \n17 \n1 \n16 \nDCCB = district central cooperative bank, PACS = primary agricultural credit society, SCB = state cooperative bank. \na  Financial  information  provided  throughout  the  cooperative  credit  structure  is  not  reliable  since  audits  are  not \n\n \nGujarat \n1 \n36 \n23 \n10 \n18 \n91 \n65 \n14 \n7,768 \n31 \n1 \n24 \n\nMaha- \nrashtra \n1 \n178 \n134 \n14 \n31 \n333 \n248 \n23 \n20,952 \n89 \n1 \n71 \n\n \nOrissa \n1 \n20 \n11 \n7 \n17 \n32 \n18 \n11 \n2,729 \n19 \n5 \n13 \n\n31 \n678 \n435 \n162 \n368 \n1,257 \n792 \n202 \n105,735 \n688 \n181 \n493 \n\n1 \n63 \n19 \n31 \n22 \n90 \n25 \n47 \n4,779 \n53 \n3 \n43 \n\n1 \n25 \n16 \n6 \n38 \n65 \n39 \n12 \n4,526 \n32 \n3 \n25 \n\nRajas-\nthan \n\nconducted independently. \n\nb   Primary Agricultural Credit Societies in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh as of 31 March 2002. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\n3. \nLegal Framework. Cooperative Societies Acts (CSA) promulgated by the PSs govern the \nCCS.  The  CSAs  allow  for  the  constitution  of  the  CCS  as  member-owned  entities.  However,  the \nCCS  has  become  an  instrument  of  state  intervention  in  the  rural  economy.  The  CSAs  assign \nexcessive  powers  to  the  registrar  of  cooperative  societies  (RCS)  in  governance  and  day-to-day \nbusiness  decisions.  For  example,  the  RCS  in  Rajasthan  is  concurrently  the  administrator  of  the \nSCB, which points to conflicting business and supervision mandates. To restore the true essence \nof cooperatives, a few states have since the mid-1990s established new parallel cooperative acts \nthat  expressly  preclude  state  ownership  and  restrict  the  powers  of  the  RCS.  Andhra  Pradesh, \nMadhya  Pradesh,  and  Orissa  are  among  the  PSs  that  have  issued  parallel  cooperative  acts. \nHowever,  the  CSAs  do  not  contain  provisions  for  enabling  existing  CCS  to  migrate  to  parallel \ncooperative acts. As a result, confusion and operational complications abound at all levels.   \n\nTable A6.3: Board Existence and Selection (as of 31 March 2003) \n\nItem \nSCBs \nElected Board \nSuperseded Boards \nof which Nominated Board \nof which Administrator \nDCCBs (number) \nElected Board \nSuperseded Boards \nof which Nominated Board \nof which Administrator \n\nAndhra \nPradesh \n \n\u2014 \nYes \nYes \n\u2014 \n22 \n\u2014 \n22 \n22 \n\u2014 \n\n \nGujarat \n \nYes \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n18 \n16 \n2 \n2 \n\u2014 \n\nMaha- \nRashtra \n \nYes \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n31 \n23 \n8 \n\u2014 \n8 \n\nMadhya \nPradesh \n \nYes \nYes \nYes \n\u2014 \n38 \n4 \n34 \n\u2014 \n34 \n\n \nOrissa \n \n\u2014 \nYes \nYes \n\u2014 \n17 \n\u2014 \n17 \n17 \n\u2014 \n\nRajas-\nthan \n \n\u2014 \nYes \n \u2014   \nYes \n27 \n\u2014 \n27 \n\u2014  \n27 \n\nTotal \n \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n153 \n43 \n110 \n41 \n69 \n\n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, SCB = state cooperative bank. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\n4. \nStatutory  Audits.

An \n5. \nSCB is usually managed by an administrator with a public service background. With the exception \nof Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the SCBs\u2019 position in the retail market is not significant in \nthe local context. Most SCBs have a share of 2\u20134% in the local deposit market and about 5\u20137% in \nthe lending market. All PSs, except Maharashtra and Gujarat, depend on external borrowings, of \nwhich NABARD is a prominent source. SCBs report high levels of nonperforming loans, especially \nin  Maharashtra  and  Andhra  Pradesh.  Although  the  SCBs  would  qualify  for  NABARD  refinance \nwithout  guarantee,  most  of  the  exposure  to  NABARD  is  de  facto  guaranteed  by  the  state \ngovernment concerned.  \n\nTable A6.5: State Cooperative Banks \u2013 Key Financial Indicators (as of 31 March 2004) \n\nIndia \n \n\nAndhra \nPradesh \n\nMaha- \nrashtra \n\nMadhya \nPradesh \n\n \nItem  \nTotal Assets \nLoans \nDeposits \nBorrowings \nEquity and Reserves \nLoans to Deposits (%) \nMarket Share Deposits (%) \nMarket Share Loans (%) \nImpaired Loans/Loans (%) \nDoubtful and Loss Loans/Loans (%) \n\n678.4 \n351.1 \n434.9 \n162.0 \n81.5 \n81 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n19 \n \n\n \nGujarat \n36.1 \n19.4 \n23.1 \n10.0 \n3.0 \n84 \n2 \n4 \n11 \n2 \n\n63.1 \n51.6 \n18.7 \n31.2 \n13.2 \n276 \n2 \n7 \n19 \n3 \n\n177.7 \n76.4 \n134.0 \n14.0 \n29.7 \n57 \n3 \n10 \n37 \n18 \n\nin Rs billion  \n\n \nOrissa \n20.1 \n12.8 \n10.8 \n6.9 \n2.4 \n119 \n4 \n6 \n9 \n3 \n\n25.1 \n17.0 \n15.5 \n6.4 \n3.2 \n110 \n3 \n6 \n10 \n6 \n\n \nRajasthan \n24.1 \n15.3 \n11.4 \n9.5 \n3.2 \n134 \n2 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n\n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\n6. \nSignificant  Erosion  of  Equity.  NABARD\u2019s  inspection  and  supervision  in  2005  identified \nseven SCBs in India that had substantially eroded capital reserves and even deposits as a result \nof  large  nonperforming  loans.  This  figure  would  increase  substantially  if  standards  similar  to \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\ncommercial banks were applied. Although SCBs in the PSs are reported to be making profits, the \nextremely high level of impaired assets and the high proportion of loans classified in the doubtful \nand loss categories raises questions as to their profitability and solvency of the SCBs, especially \nin Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh, as well as the remaining SCBs if \nnorms at par with commercial banks are applied. The high level of impaired assets mainly reflects \nthe adverse impact of nonperforming loans in the lower CCS tiers on the system as a whole.  \n\n2. \n\nThe District Central Cooperative Banks  \n\n7. \nSimilar to the SCBs, the DCCBs are owned by member PACSs and the Government, and \nthe  latter  usually  appoint  the  administrator  of  the  DCCB.  Compared  with  the  SCBs,  the  market \nshare  of  the  DCCBs  at  the  district  level  is  more  substantial  especially  in  the  credit  segment \nranging from 10\u201322%. The DCCBs\u2019 share in the district deposit market is low and more than 50% \nof the DCCBs (except for Maharashtra) reported loan-to-deposit ratios exceeding 100% in 2005. \nThe high dependency on SCB and NABARD resources reflects that many DCCBs are not seen \nas creditworthy, and that commercial banks may be more responsive to depositors\u2019 needs. \n\nTable A6.6: District Central Cooperative Banks \u2013 Key Financial Indicators  \n(as of 31 March 2004) \n\n                                                                                                                                                                   in Rs billion \n\n \nItem \nTotal Assets \nLoans \nDeposits \nBorrowings \nEquity and Reserves \nLoss making DCCBs (%) \nLoans to Deposits (%) \n% of Districts Exceeding l/d of 1/1 (%) \nMarket Share Deposits (%) \nMarket Share Loans (%) \nImpaired Loans/Loans (%) \nDoubtful and Loss Loans/Loans (%) \n\u2014 = not available, DCCB = district central cooperative bank, l/d = loan to deposit. \nSource: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. \n\nAndhra \nPradesh \n90.5 \n70.0 \n24.7 \n46.9 \n18.9 \n5 \n284 \n100 \n2 \n10 \n16 \n6 \n\n \nGujarat \n90.6 \n48.3 \n64.9 \n13.6 \n12.1 \n22.0 \n78 \n56 \n6 \n10 \n17 \n12 \n\nIndia \n \n1,259.6 \n671.5 \n791.5 \n202.1 \n263.3 \n\u2014 \n85 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n23 \n\u2014 \n\nMaha- \nrashtra \n333.0 \n173.6 \n248.2 \n23.6 \n61.2 \n32 \n66 \n29 \n6 \n22 \n25 \n14 \n\nMadhya \nPradesh \n65.0 \n47.8 \n39.2 \n12.4 \n13.4 \n37 \n96 \n79 \n4 \n12 \n29 \n13 \n\n \nOrissa \n31.6 \n23.5 \n18.3 \n10.8 \n2.5 \n6 \n130 \n82 \n6 \n11 \n16 \n10 \n\n \nRajasthan \n\n41.1 \n27.8 \n22.7 \n13.1 \n5.3 \n4 \n125 \n70 \n5 \n2 \n11 \n4 \n\n8. \nNABARD reports a high number of loss making DCCBs, most of which are above 20% in \nthe PSs. NABARD\u2019s inspection and supervision in 2005 highlights the extremely poor collection of \ndues by DCCBs especially in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Orissa, where more than one-\nthird  were  unable  to  recover  60%  of  dues.  The high  proportion  of  impaired  loans, which  ranges \nfrom 16\u201329% of the aggregate DCCB loan portfolio, underscores the severity of the problem. The \npoor portfolio quality raises serious questions as to the liquidity, profitability, and solvency, which \nwould  be  largely  overstated  if  Reserve  Bank  of  India  asset  classification  and  accounting \nstandards are applied. DCCBs are currently unable to adequately underwrite and monitor loans at \nthe  district  and  village  levels,  and  the  absence  of  automation  and  proper  accounting  and  audit \nprocesses undermines the integrity and timeliness of management information. \n\n3. \n\nThe Primary Agricultural Credit Societies  \n\n9. \nThe PACSs constitute the grassroots tier of the CCS and typically have 1 to 2 staff. The \nstrength of PACSs lies in their closeness and accessibility to village clients, who would incur high \ntravel  cost  to  access  the  branch  network  of  the  DCCBs.  Since  the  CCS  has  so  far  largely \nfunctioned as state governments\u2019 supply system for agriculture credit, the PACSs\u2019 business is not \nlimited  to  financial  services,  but  also  includes  services  of  input  supply  and  marketing  of  crops. \n\n \n\n\f Appendix 6 \n\n     63 \n\nBecause of the absence of democratic structures for the management of PACSs, on-site controls \nand accountability through the board is essentially nonexistent. The lack of democratic ownership \nand  responsibility  has  been  compounded  by  political  interference,  lack  of  skills  among  PACSs \nstaff, and inadequate supervision by the DCCBs.  \n\n10.  Where  reports  exist,  these  usually  point  to  extremely  high  levels  of  impaired  assets. \nAlthough  deposit  mobilization  is  limited  at  the  PACSs  level,  some  PACSs  mobilize  significant \namounts  without  being  under  an  appropriate  regulatory  umbrella.  This  creates  significant \ncontingent  liabilities  for  the  state  governments  if  the  PACSs  are  unable  to  repay  depositors. \nNABARD  reports  that  almost  60%  of  all  PACSs  were  unprofitable,  and  in  Andhra  Pradesh  and \nOrissa  about  80%  of  PACSs  are  reportedly  loss  making.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Rajasthan, \nvirtually  no  audit  reporting  exists  that  refers  to  the  last  3  financial  years.  The  absence  of  basic \nbusiness  skills,  systems,  and  controls  at  the  PACSs  level,  and  the  high  level  of  impaired  loans \nhas led to an almost complete erosion of equity and deposits. As a result, a rigorous audit would \nlikely  result  in  most  PACSs  being  classified  as  insolvent.  It  is  critical  to  establish  simple \naccounting  and  audit  frameworks,  and  conduct  audits  to  establish  a  bottom  line  as  to  which \nPACSs  could  become  viable  and  which  should  be  closed  or  integrated  into  other  local  service \nstructures. Once audits are completed, it will be important to recruit and train staff to acquire the \nbasic skills to restore the remaining PACSs into functional entities.         \n\nAndhra \nPradesha \n2004

issues  in  the  cooperative  credit \nstructure  (CCS);  (ii)  relevant  risk  analysis  of  the  CCS;  (iii)  controls  for  corruption  at  the  sector \nand  Program1  level;  and  (iv)  recommendations  on  how  the  findings  of  the  assessment  can  be \nincorporated into the design of the Program.  \n \n2. \nRelevant Governance Issues in CCS. The Government of India (the Government) has \nput  in  place  a  reform  package  for  the  CCS.  Governance  and  risk  issues  with  respect  to  the \nproposed  reforms  can  be  considered  along  the  following  lines:  (i)  legal  dimensions,  (ii) \ninstitutional/political dimensions, and (iii) issue of simultaneity and phasing. \n \n3. \nLegal Dimensions. The Cooperative Societies Act (CSA), 1912, is the core legal basis \nfor  the  CCS.  Given  its  inadequacies,  the  CCS  reforms  require  major  amendments  in  the  state \nspecific  CSAs.  Since  this  is  likely  to  take  some  time,  it  has  been  proposed  that  state \ngovernments  in  the  meantime  issue  administrative  measures  to  put  the  provisions  of  the \nproposed amendments into effect. Other relevant laws in this area are: the Banking Regulation \nAct  (BR  Act),  1949;  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  Act,  1982; \nCompanies  (Amendment)  Act,  2001;  and  the  Deposit  Insurance  and  Credit  Guarantee \nCorporation  Act,  1961.  While  the  BR  Act  gives  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  powers  to \nregulate  all  banks,  state  governments  need  to  amend  CSAs  to  enable  the  RBI  to  exercise  its \nregulatory powers under the BR Act directly. The regulatory enforcement of CCS remains weak \nsince the state governments\u2014through their office of Registrar of Cooperative Societies\u2014tend to \ndilute or delay RBI recommendations. \n \nInstitutional  and  Political  Dimensions.  The  institutional  and  functional  complexity  of \n4. \nCCS is one of the reasons for the weak governance of the base level primary agricultural credit \nsocieties  (PACS).  The  sheer  number  of  PACSs  (105,735),  along  with  very  little  credible  data, \nmakes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect issues in time for corrective actions. There \nis also weak capability in the sector.  \n \n5. \nIssue  of  Simultaneity  and  Phasing.  The  issue  of  sequencing  reforms  is  critical.  The \nrelease of funds for cleaning the balance sheets would have to await a special audit and release \nof  committed  liabilities  of  governments.  Also,  the  costs  of  reforms  will  most  likely  not  be  near-\nsimilar  for  the  selected  states.  As  such,  the  incentive  to  engage  in  reforms  will  be  disparate, \neventually militating against rapid reforms of the sector throughout India.  \n \nA. \n \n6. \nUnderlying  Assumptions.  The  main  assumptions  in  the  risk  analysis  are:  (i)  that  the \nGovernment  will  stay  the  course  in  its  objective  of  CCS  reforms,  and  political  commitment  to \nattain  it;  (ii)  that  the  legal  reforms  sought  will  materialize  and  be  sustained  in  the  immediate \nfuture;  (iii)  that  effective  institution  building  in  key  agencies  will  continue;  and  (iv)  that  state \ngovernments will support the proposed CCS reforms. \n \n7. \n \n\nRisk Specification. The potential risks can be grouped into several categories: \n\nRisks, their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPolitical risks include, e.g., Government\u2019s commitment to reforms dwindles, state \ngovernments  continue  to  politicize  operations  in  CCS,  and  there  is  a  political \nbacklash pursuant to closure of unviable CCS institutions. \nLegal  risks  include,  among  others,  failing  to  legislate  to  limit  the  role  of  state \ngovernments in CCS, and delays in institutionalizing legal arrangements. \n\n                                                 \n1 Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n69 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDesign risks include, among others, delays in special audits, inadequate financial \nassistance, and inappropriate sequencing of actions. \nFinally,  implementation  risks,  of  which  there  are  many,  include  delays  in \nimplementing  common  accounting  systems  and  rules  for  accounting,  disclosure, \netc.; delays in and/or weak guidelines on internal audit procedures; proliferation in \nadjustment  costs;  high  transaction/compliance  costs  of  regulation;  low  level  of \ncapacity; and continued risk of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement in CCS. \n\n \nRisk Severity.

The  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988,  tries  to  address  the  issue  of  corruption  in \ngeneral.  Additional  steps  to  fight  mismanagement  are  strengthened  audit  systems,  rigorous \nmonitoring systems, transparent loan appraisals, and integrated mechanisms for grassroots civil \nsociety organizations to monitor Program results during implementation. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nand Development Program, it is recommended to: \n \n\nTo enhance the design and implementation of the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring \n\nRecommendations \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nincorporate good governance and anticorruption provisions in loan assurances; \nget  stakeholder  concurrence  of  governance  and  corruption  risk  mitigation \nstrategies; \nacquire information during review missions on: revised structures and processes \nwithin CCS to assess progress in managing governance and corruption risks; and \nreview  of  incidences  of  mismanagement  and  inefficiencies  in  the  CCS  in  the \nparticipating states; and \nthe  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessment  at  a  suitable \nrevisit \nopportunity in the Program period to assess how conditions may have been more \n(or less) favorable for effective implementation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n71 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nEconomic and Agricultural Growth. While India\u2019s overall gross domestic product growth has been robust in recent \nyears and is projected to remain in the 7\u20138% range during 2007\u20132009, it has not been particularly broad-based or \ninclusive. Of particular concern is the poor performance of agriculture,  which shows an average growth rate of just \n1.3%  over  the  past  3  years\u2014against  a  Tenth  Plan  target  of  4%\u2014and  appears  to  be  on  a  long-term  decline. \nEmployment  growth  has  also  declined,  mainly  due  to  low  rural  growth,  causing  a  sharp  increase  in  absolute \nunemployment (from 20 million in 1993\u20131994 to 27 million in 1999\u20132000). Nearly two-thirds of the rural labor force is \nemployed  in  a  sector  that  produces  less  than  one-fifth  of  gross  domestic  product  and  where  productivity  has  been \ndeclining. Low productivity growth depresses employment and wages in agriculture. Low wages and abundant labor \nlimit  incentives  for  capital  investments,  which,  in  turn,  restrains  productivity  growth.  The  midterm  appraisal  of  the \nTenth  Plan  indicates  that  while  some  progress  has  been  made  in  social  indicators  (such  as  education  and  health) \nover time, there are disturbing gender gaps, large rural-urban differences, and wide variations across states despite \nsteady  growth  over  the  last  decade.  This,  in  turn,  jeopardizes  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goal \ntargets within the stipulated time. Disparities in economic and social development across regions and among different \nsegments of society are widening. According to the Planning Commission\u2019s approach to the 11th Five-Year Plan, the \ndeceleration in agricultural growth is the root of the rural distress that has surfaced in many parts of the country. \n \nAgriculture and Rural Poverty. India still has widespread poverty, with 75% of its poor living in rural areas. The vast \nmajority of the rural poor are engaged in agriculture, either as agricultural wage laborers, marginal farmers, or self-\nemployed workers. Almost 42% of the rural poor fall into the most economically disadvantaged group of agricultural \nlabor;  another  32%  are  self-employed  households  primarily  working  in  agriculture.  Nearly  42%  of  rural  poor \nhouseholds are landless, over 80% cultivate less than 1 hectare of land, and 74% are engaged as agricultural labor \nor in activities indirectly related to agriculture. This indicates limited opportunity for the poor in other sectors and high \ndependence  on  agriculture  for  livelihoods,  despite  low  wages  and  unemployment.  Poverty  is  an  upshot  of  low \nincomes  and  unemployment,  especially  in  rural  areas:  landless  and  marginal  farmers  mostly  rely  on  some  form  of \nwage employment as a principal means of livelihood. But agricultural wage work is available only for about 60 days a \nyear  while  casual  (construction)  wage  work  is  available  for  about  150  days  a  year.  Agricultural  wages  vary  from   \nRs20\u201340  per  day.  In  many  locations  there  has  been  a  steady  decline  in  village  employment  opportunities  over  the \nlast  few  decades  due  to  the  increasing  population  pressure  and  weak  labor  demand,  which  exerts  downward \npressure on wages. Availability of work is seasonal (cultivation and harvesting). Total earnings regularly fall short of \nthe  minimum  to  meet  basic  needs  and  laborers  perpetually  need  credit  from  employers.  Government  employment \nprograms  provide  some  relief,  but  fall  well  short  of  what  is  needed.  The  constraint  is  not  only  to  find  steady  work \nthroughout  the  year,  but  also  to  obtain  fair  wages.  Wage  rates  are  usually  below  the  minimum  level.  There  is,  in \naddition,  widespread  gender  discrimination,  with  wages  for  women  well  below  those  for  men  for  the  same  work. \nSmall  farmers  lack  bargaining  power  to  get  a  fair  return  from  agriculture;  markets  are  controlled  by  intermediaries, \nwho exploit the farmers; and lack of formal financial services results in heavy reliance on village money lenders, who \ncharge very high interest rates. Without savings and financial assets to protect them from shocks (natural calamities \nand price volatility), farmers have little incentive to invest in new technologies and diversify their production.  \n \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Finance.  Current  government  plans  identify  lack  of  credit  as  one  of  the  causes  for  the \ndecelerating  growth  in  agriculture.  At  a  broader  level,  inadequate  access  to  sustainable  rural  finance  services \nconstrains rural growth and employment. This is confirmed by the poor who identify lack of access to affordable credit \nas  a  major  hurdle  in  improving  their  household  income.  In  large  part,  this  reflects  the  collapse  of  the  cooperative \ncredit structure (CCS). Other formal finance institutions are often reluctant to lend down-market to serve the needs of \nthe  lower  segment  of  the  rural  population.  As  a  result,  the  rural  poor  rely  on  informal  sources  of  finance,  including \nprivate  moneylenders.  Lending  interest  rates  for  such  transactions  are  anywhere  from  25%  to  360%  per  year.  Not \nonly is this credit expensive, but also insufficient to start a small rural enterprise. Furthermore, lack of risk mitigating \nmeasures against natural disasters and volatility of agricultural prices further accentuate the vulnerability, particularly, \nfor  small  and  marginal  farmers.    Farmers  might  not  obtain  the  returns  to  repay  loan  principal,  which  leads  to  fresh \nloans  with  some  additional  credit  for  the  start  of  the  new  agricultural  season.  In  addition,  the  conventional  form  of \nlending  through  mortgaging  of  land  is  becoming  more  common:  moneylenders  insist  on  sale  of  land  with  a  verbal \npromise  that  it  will  be  sold  back  to  the  debtor  following  repayment.  With  moneylenders  also  being  traders,  there  is \ninterlocking  of  input,  credit,  land,  and  output  markets  that  trap  small  and  marginal  farmers  in  a  spiral  of  massive \ndebts. \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nFarmer Suicides. Spate of suicides by farmers in recent years characterize India\u2019s agrarian crisis, particularly in the \nstates of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. The phenomenon is ongoing, and no longer limited to drought \nand  poverty  stricken  areas,  but  is  spreading  to  more  productive  agricultural  regions  as  farmers  seek  to  escape \nmounting indebtedness. Furthermore, the suicides occur both among large landholders and the landless and across \nall  caste  groups.  In  many  cases,  the  suicides  are  linked  to  the  failure  of  new  seeds  to  deliver  expected  output, \ninability to meet the rising costs of production, and collapse of market prices. Farmers do not have the ability to bear \ndownside risks. The link between indebtedness and suicide has been highlighted by studies undertaken by the Tata \nInstitute  of  Social  Sciences  (2005)  and  the  Indira  Gandhi  Institute  of  Development  Research  (2006)  based  on \nextensive  survey  in  the  state  of  Maharashtra.  Both  the  studies  identify  interlinked  and  co-existing  socioeconomic \nstressors  as  key  causes  for  suicides:  (i)  indebtedness  (87%),  (ii)  deterioration  of  economic  status  (74%),  (iii)  crop \nfailure  (41%),  and  (iv)  decline  in  social  status  (36%).  However,  suicides  are  just  one  of  the  several  indicators  of \ndistress: children are dropping out of school, widowhood is proliferating, and cattle and other \u201cassets\u201d of the poor are \nbeing  sold  off.  Addressing  these  require  not  only  short-term  relief,  but  also  long-term  measures  to  rehabilitate  the \nentire agrarian system, of which the CCS is a critical part. \n \nCooperative  Credit  Structure.  With  a  large  membership  base,  the  CCS  has  inherent  advantages  in  tackling  the \nproblems  of  rural  poverty  and  unemployment,  through  delivery  of  rural  finance  services  in  areas  where  both  the \npublic and the private sectors have failed. However, in some states, CCS has very little stakeholder participation in \nmanagement.  There  have  been  no  elections  for  years,  and  the  CCS  now  largely  operates  as  government  entities. \nThe  politicization  of  the  CCS\u2014a  consequence  of  the  state  government  interference\u2014is  preventing  them  from \nfunctioning as autonomous member-centric and member-governed institutions. The inadequacy of the CCS not only \nprevents it from effectively reducing rural poverty, but is also contributing to the increasing rural inequality, as rural \npoor have very little if any alternative sources of affordable rural finance services. Restoring control of the CCS to the \nmembers within an appropriate governance and transparency framework will bring major improvements to the rural \nsociety.  Through  the  delivery  of  sustainable  rural  finance  services,  the  proposed  Rural  Cooperative  Credit \nRestructuring and Development Program (the Program) will (i) facilitate better access to productive resources, such \nas  farm  inputs  and  improved  technologies;  (ii)  allow  higher  returns  from  farming;  (iii)  increase  employment \nopportunities for the landless; (iv) allow greater responsiveness to emerging rural nonfarm enterprise opportunities; \nand  (v)  increase  accumulation  of  financial  assets  and,  therefore,  improved  risk  management.  Improved  access  to \nrural  finance  services  will,  therefore,  help  inclusive  rural  development  through  enhanced  income  and  employment \ngrowth. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nOver  the  last  decade,  India  grew  rapidly  and  the  percentage  of  people  below  the  poverty  line  declined.  While  the \noverall  poverty  rate  declined,  the  extent  of  poverty  reduction  is  debatable.  Although  some  estimates  indicate  that \npoverty  declined  from  about  36%  in  fiscal  year  1993  to  around  26%  in  fiscal  year  1999,  other  estimates  differ \ndepending on the model used to adjust for comparability. Various estimates range between 4.2 and 10.3 percentage \npoints for rural areas and between 5.8 and 8.8 percentage points for urban areas. Data from a new National Sample \nSurvey Organization is being processed and detailed results will be available in 2007. There is consensus however, \nthat  the  proportion  of  the  population  under  the  poverty  line  is  declining  at  a  modest  pace,  but  large  parts  of  the \npopulation are yet to experience a decisive improvement in living standards.  \n \nThe Government and the Asian Development Bank jointly undertook participatory poverty assessments over the past \n5  years  encompassing  842  locations  in  78  districts  spread  over  seven  states  at  various  stages  of  economic  and \nsocial  development.  The  study  covered  rural  and  urban  areas,  mixed  and  separate  gender  groups,  various \ncategories of the poor, and a range of stakeholders. The poor expressed lack of accessible credit as a major hurdle \nin  improving  their  livelihoods.  Assured  and  accessible  institutional  credit  facilities  were  considered  by  the  poor  as \nessential  to  create  sustainable  employment  opportunities.  The  Program  includes  a  baseline  socioeconomic  survey \nand  assessment  of  CCS  reform  implementation  before  the  release  of  the  second  and  the  third  tranches  of  the \nProgram. The baseline survey  will collect the following information on rural households: demographic structure and \neconomic  activities;  food  security  and  vulnerability;  housing  indicators;  land  ownership;  and  ownership  of  other \nassets. The poverty analysis will focus on: (i) poverty mapping and assessment of the rural poor who are unable to \naccess  rural  finance  services;  (ii)  stocktaking  of  productive  assets  and  skills  of  the  rural  poor,  including  financial \nliteracy to determine the intervention areas for rural finance outreach; (iii) identifying any social, political, and cultural \nconstraints for the rural poor in accessing rural finance services; and (iv) assessing the rural finance service delivery \noptions  and  social  intermediation  support  to  maximize  investment  returns  and  impacts,  including  for  poor  rural \nwomen.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n73 \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nThe project preparatory technical assistance conducted various levels of participatory stakeholder analysis. \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe Program aims to transform the CCS into genuine member-owned entities. Internally, this implies that CCS will be \ndriven by the needs and priorities of members. The reformed CCS will provide a forum for discussion of local issues, \nmobilize local resources, build up bargaining and claim-making power of local communities to widen the options for \nincome-generating activities, and enhance local control over factors of production. Improved access to rural finance \nservices  through  the  CCS  will  bring  the  rural  poor  into  the  economic  mainstream.  Furthermore,  the  Program  will \nsupport social intermediation to empower the rural poor, including rural women, for effective access to rural finance \nservices. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn  the  last  quarter  of  the  century,  Indian  women  have  significantly  improved  their  overall  well-being.  Yet  women  in \nIndia  remain  one  of  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  in  society.  The  women  to  men  ratio  rose  marginally  during \n1991/2001 (933), after dropping for almost an entire century (944 in 1901 to 927 in 1991). India accounts for about \none-fourth  of  all  maternity-related  deaths  in  the  world.  Over  90%  of  rural  women  workers  are  unskilled  and  about \n90% are engaged in the informal/unorganized sector. Wage rates in agriculture for women are, on average, 30\u201350% \nless than for men. Women casual laborers in rural India show the highest incidence of poverty of any occupational \ncategory. Rural women have very limited access to formal and affordable rural finance services. Although close to a \nfifth  of  all  rural  households  in  India  are  female-headed,  few  women  hold  titles  to  land.  Even  in  land-owning \nhouseholds, they do most of the  work on the farm, but are not seen as farmers. Women account for 90% of those \nengaged  in  transplantation.  They  also  make  up  76%  of  those  sowing  seeds  and  82%  of  people  transporting  crops \nfrom field to home. They are a third of the work force that prepares the land for cultivation, and between 70 and 90% \nof those involved in dairy.  \n\nAs employment and wages decline in rural areas, many families migrate to towns. Men seek work as auto drivers or \ndaily wage laborers, often without success. In such situations women have to bring up the children and manage the \nfarms.  In  addition,  drunkenness  of  farmers  and  domestic  violence  are  on  the  rise.  These  have  led  to  a  rise  in  the \nincidence of suicides among women. In a single year from August 2001 to July 2002, there were 311 recorded cases \nof women suicides in just one district. Close to 80% of these 311 women were from villages and most of the women \nhad a farm background.  \n\nConsidering  the  importance  of  financial  services  in  rural  areas  and  the  low  outreach  of  formal  financial  institutions, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  have  begun  to  examine  alternative  ways  to  enhance  access  to  credit  by  the \nrural  poor  since  the  mid-1970s.  In  1992,  a  pilot  program  of  establishing  and  linking  self-help-groups  (SHG)  of  the \npoor with the banking system was launched by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).  \nThe program started with only 500 SHGs all over India in 1992 and has now expanded to 1.6 million SHGs in 2004. \nThese SHGs reached nearly 24 million borrowers, of which 90% are poor rural women. At present, there are three \ngroups of SHGs with different forms of linkages: (i) SHGs formed and financed by banks (20%), (ii) SHGs formed by \nother  formal  agencies  (such  as  district  central  cooperative  banks  [DCCB])  but  financed  by  banks  (72%),  and  (iii) \nSHGs financed by banks using NGOs and other agencies (8%).  \n\nA  typical  SHG  consists  of  10  to  20  women,  most  from  the  same  village,  often  from  the  same  community  and \neconomic status. They pool their monthly savings and rotate it as a personal consumption loan for 6 months to a year \nuntil  they  become  eligible  for  a  grant/loan  from  a  local  NGO  or  a  government  program  or  even  a  nonbank  finance \ncompany.  Female  borrowers  may  undertake  some  farm-based  activity  by  taking  a  loan  for  some  sort  of  family \nenterprise or to meet emergency consumption needs. Women, in effect, become the conduit through which the family \nis  able  to  access  some  credit,  though  recent  suicides  indicate  that  men  still  take  the  majority  of  loans  that  involve \nmortgaging the land or the house or other family assets. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nNABARD  seeks  to  remove  the  barriers  to  credit  for  women.  It  aims  to  identify  appropriate  economic  activities  for \nwomen and promote women SHGs and link them with the formal banking system. NABARD has played an important \nrole in promoting SHGs in the form of grants, loans, and revolving fund assistance to NGOs. Exclusive schemes for  \nwomen    have      been      implemented  such  as  (i)  Assistance  to  Rural  Women  in  Nonfarm  Development,  which \nenvisages that women\u2019s groups organized or  sponsored  by   a  suitable   agency  would  avail  of  bank credit,  not \nexceeding  Rs50,000 per member,  for  an own account activity or group activity, with 100% refinance support from \nNABARD; and (ii) assistance for Marketing of Nonfarm Products of Rural Women that  seeks to create a `niche' or \n`pro-women' market and assists in credit by way of 100% refinance up to Rs1 million. \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTo facilitate focused and strategic interventions for enhancing access to formal credit for rural women, a scheme for \nsupporting  the  establishment  of  Women  Development  Cells  (WDC)  in  regional  rural  banks  and  DCCBs  was \nintroduced in 1995. NABARD has supported 100 such cells with grants of Rs2 million. Guidelines to set up WDCs in \nall banks to strengthen credit delivery to  women and to provide credit plus services to them have been developed. \nNABARD  has  modified  the  scheme  to  extend  support  to  WDCs  set  up  by  regional  rural  banks  and  DCCBs  as  an \nincentive.  The  incentives  include  100%  refinance  to  cover  credit  given  to  women;  grant  assistance  for  gender \nresponsive management information system for collection  and maintenance of gender disaggregated  data; mobility \nallowances  for  identified  officers  of  the  WDC  for  facilitating  activities  like  awareness  creation,  credit  camps, \ncounseling,  and  training,  which  will  help  in  increasing  the  credit  flow  to  women;  costs  of  gender  sensitization \nprograms  and  other  gender  related  programs  for  capacity  building  of  bank  staff;  promotional  assistance  costs  for \naddressing  the  capacity  building  of  women  entrepreneurs;  and  costs  toward  awareness  creation  and  publicity \ncampaigns for women relating to banking aspects. This also includes the cost of publicity literature to reach women. \n \nRestoring  control  of  the  CCS  to  the  members  and  reforming  the  CCS  financially  and  institutionally  is  expected  to \nsignificantly enhance rural financial intermediation. This will enable greater outreach, including to rural women. The \nongoing schemes for women and the changing attitude of the banks towards female borrowers will further facilitate \naccess to credit for women. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nE. \n\n \nItem \n\n \n \nResettlement \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nNo resettlement is anticipated. The Program is focused on \naddressing  the  weakness  of  the  CCS  at  the  policy  and \ninstitutional level, and will not involve acquisition of land or \nloss of livelihoods or assets.  \n\nThere  will  be  no  affordability-related \nissues.  The \nexpanded  outreach  of  rural  finance  services  will  reduce \ndependence  on  expensive  informal  sources  of  credit, \nincrease  efficiency,  and  reduce  the  cost  of  rural  finance \nservices.  \n\nThe  Program  will  have  both  direct  and  indirect  positive \nemployment  impacts.  As  a  result  of  reform  of  the  CCS, \nqualified personnel will be hired. Enhanced client outreach \nand \nimproved  risk  mitigation  as  a  result  of  CCS \nrestructuring  will  increase  rural  economic  activity  and \ncreate new employment opportunities. \nNo  adverse  issues  are  anticipated.  Indigenous  peoples \nwill  benefit  from  expanded  outreach  of  rural  finance \nservices.  \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\nNone expected. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  31 October 2006)  \n", "Currency Units\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupees (Re/Rs) \n$0.0221 \nRs45.16 \n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, the rate of $1.00 = Rs46 has been used. \n", "ADB \nCSA \nCFM \nCCS  \nDCCB \nDLIC \nFY \nGDP \nKfW \nMACSA \nMOU \nNABARD \nNCMP \nNGO \nPACS \nPCARDB \nPPMS \nPS \nRBI \nRFI \nRRB \nSCARDB \nSCB \nSHG \nSLIC \nTA \nUSAID \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \ncooperative societies act \ncommodity futures market \ncooperative credit structure \ndistrict central cooperative bank  \ndistrict-level implementation committee \nfiscal year \ngross domestic product \nGerman Bank for Reconstruction and Development  \nmutually aided cooperatives societies act \nmemorandum of understanding  \nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development  \nNational Common Minimum Program \nnongovernment organization \nprimary agricultural credit society  \nprimary cooperative agriculture and rural development bank \nprogram performance monitoring system \nparticipating state  \nReserve Bank of India  \nrural finance institution \nregional rural bank \nstate cooperative agriculture and rural development bank \nstate cooperative bank  \nself-help group \nstate-level implementation committee \ntechnical assistance \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 March.
