Assam is the largest state in the North Eastern Region of India in terms of economy and \npopulation and occupies a strategic position for various regional cooperation programs in South \nAsia and Southeast Asia.1 Despite its abundant natural resources and higher proportion of young \npopulation (under 40 years of age) than the rest of India, Assam has yet to unleash its growth \npotential. Assam is landlocked and largely rural, and has underdeveloped infrastructure, and its \neconomy is dominated by low value-added, natural resource-based products and is poorly \nintegrated with regional and global value chains. Its manufacturing sectors are undiversified and \nsmall in terms of outputs and capital investment. Studies conducted by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  indicate  that  aggressive  infrastructure  and  industrial  development,  specifically, \ncorridor-based industrial development, is necessary for Assam to grow its economy. However, \nthey identify limited availability of a skilled workforce as one of the constraints.2 Fewer prospects \nfor socioeconomic development have propelled out-migration for jobs and education, leading to \nshortages of higher-level skills in Assam. Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nand higher education are undersupplied, and face many challenges, including (i) low quality and \nlow industry relevance of education and training programs, leading to poor employability of \ngraduates  from  industrial  training  institutes  (ITIs),  polytechnics,  engineering  colleges,  and \nacademic colleges and universities; and (ii) inadequate training systems for trainers and faculty \nof ITIs and polytechnics. \n \n2.  The Assam Skill University Project will assist the Government of Assam in strengthening \nthe industry-aligned and flexible skills education and training system in Assam through the \nestablishment of a skill university. The project will have five outputs: (i) university management \nand operating systems, business models, and faculty development and management systems \ndeveloped; (ii) environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient university campus and facilities \ndeveloped; (iii) industry-aligned and flexible skills education and training programs designed and \ndelivered;  (iv)  capacity  to  manage  and  support  entrepreneurship,  applied  research  and \ndevelopment  (R&D),  and  technology  transfer  developed;  and  (v)  access  to  professional \ndevelopment and quality skills education and training resources improved. The project is aligned \nwith the following impacts: decent employment for all ensured, and inclusive and sustainable \ninfrastructure and industrial development accelerated. The Government of India has requested a \nregular loan of $112 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The \nproject is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2021\u20132023.3 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Assam was home to about 24.8 million people aged 15 years and above (49% women) in \n2018, of which more than 11.4 million (46%) were in the labor force (84% in rural areas), and 10.6 \nmillion (93% of the labor force) were employed.4 The share of nonfarm employment grew steadily, \n \n1  For example, the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n2  ADB. 2021.

New Delhi.  \n \n ", "2 \nfrom 32% in 2005 to 44% in 2012, and to 77% in 2018.5 Educational attainment of the population \nremains low: in 2018, 82% of the population aged 15 years and above received education only \nup to grade 10 and below, or did not receive education at all, while 13% attained grades 11\u201312, \nand barely 5% completed higher education.6 The incidence of poverty in the state remains higher \nthan the national average.7 These issues are further compounded by the state\u2019s vulnerability to \nnatural hazards such as cyclonic storms and floods, which are likely to intensify because of \nclimate change. \n \n4.  Lack of pathways for progression and mobility. The TVET and higher education \nsystems in Assam do not provide pathways for progression and mobility. In fiscal year (FY) 2019, \nthe TVET and higher education systems in Assam comprised (i) 36 ITIs offering courses leading \nto the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) levels 3\u20135 certificates, (ii) 23 polytechnics \noffering diploma courses, (iii) 46 engineering colleges offering engineering degree programs, and \n(iv) 544 colleges and 22 universities offering diplomas and academic degree programs. More than \n10 academic colleges and universities also offer programs leading to NSQF level 7 bachelor of \nvocation degrees and level 9 master of vocation degrees, but the uptake of these programs has \nbeen minimal without adequate pathways for progression and mobility between different types of \ninstitutions. ITIs and polytechnics are generally perceived by youth as less attractive options than \ndegree-granting engineering and academic institutions because few opportunities are available \nfor graduates from ITIs and polytechnics for upskilling and pursuing further study. On the other \nhand,  graduates  from  engineering  and  academic  colleges  and  universities  have  limited \nopportunities for employment-oriented skills development. \n \n5.  Skill universities. Against this background, the National Policy for Skill Development and \nEntrepreneurship 2015 envisaged the establishment of \u201cskill universities\u201d.8 Skill universities are \nintended to offer industry-aligned skills education and training programs with multiple entry and \nexit options leading to NSQF level 4 qualifications and above. They are integrated with higher \neducation to create pathways for progression and mobility. Skill universities are also expected to \nconduct industry-relevant applied R&D, train trainers and faculty of ITIs and polytechnics, and \npromote quality and industry relevance of training courses and programs provided by various \ninstitutions as a hub. The concept of skill universities anticipated the National Education Policy \n2020, which sets out to reform the higher education system into a multidisciplinary and flexible \nsystem with multiple entry and exit points, by integrating professional education and TVET.9 \n \n6.  Assam Skill University. In September 2020, the Assam Legislative Assembly passed the \nAssam Skill University Act to establish Assam Skill University (ASU) in compliance with the \nregulations of the Government of India\u2019s University Grants Commission. The Government of \nAssam envisages ASU to (i) distinguish itself as a premium institution with its campus and facilities \nequipped with the state-of-the-art technologies; (ii) fill critical gaps in high-quality, industry-\naligned, and flexible skill education and training integrated with higher education; (iii) conduct \napplied R&D and technology transfer; (iv) support entrepreneurship and business startups; and \n(v) raise skill levels to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of various industries in \n \n5  The 2005 and 2012 data are from World Bank Group. 2017.

The state government also expects ASU to cater for the \nneeds  of  students;  TVET  and  higher  education  institutions;  and  industries  in  neighboring \ncountries, which face similar challenges in skills education and training, and with which the state \nhas long-standing relationships. ASU will be located about 74 kilometers east of Guwahati, and \nfalling within 25 kilometers of National Highway 27 connecting Guwahati with other major cities in \nAssam. National Highway 27 is integrated with other modes of transport (i.e., airways, waterways, \nand railways) and provides important connectivity to neighboring states and countries. \n \n7.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  the  Government  of  Assam  in \nestablishing  ASU  as  a  premium  institution  through  research,  policy  advice,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Technical assessments conducted for the project have identified gaps in the \nexpertise and capacity available within the state government, especially against a background of \nrapidly evolving markets for technologies in areas such as environmentally sustainable and \nclimate-resilient building and facility design and management; and teaching, learning, and career \nmanagement, especially in the context of post-coronavirus disease pandemic recovery. The \ncapacity and resources for skills education and training and applied R&D also need to be \ndeveloped in fields of common interest where ASU can collaborate with other TVET and higher \neducation institutions in neighboring countries. To maximize its impacts on the local economy, \nASU needs to develop programs and facilities that cater to the needs of local entrepreneurs; \nstartups;  and micro,  small,  and medium-sized  enterprises (MSMEs) for  technology,  digital, \nbusiness, and skilling solutions. The TA was requested to develop the capacity of and provide \nexpertise currently unavailable to the state government for the establishment of ASU as a \npremium institution in the medium term. Meanwhile, to lay the foundations of ASU in the short \nterm, the project will support (i) the development of the ASU campus and facilities; (ii) ASU\u2019s \nmanagement and operating systems; (iii) the capacity of ASU\u2019s management, faculty, and staff \nmembers; and (iv) ASU\u2019s core skills education and training programs. \n \n8.  Lessons. Lessons from ongoing TA in support of skills development projects in India have \nbeen  incorporated  into  the  design  of  this  TA,  including  the  importance  of  (i)  introducing \ninternational best practices in TVET infrastructure development, curriculum design, training of \ntrainers, and quality assurance by facilitating partnerships with TVET institutions abroad; and (ii) \nconducting in-depth market research on emerging technologies and industries to inform the \ndesign and management of TVET infrastructure and skills development programs.10 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Environmentally  sustainable  and  climate-resilient  design  and \nmanagement systems for university campus and facilities introduced. The TA will support \nASU management and administration teams to (i) review the detailed design and engineering \ndrawings of the ASU campus and facilities, which will be prepared by the civil works contractor \nengaged under the loan; and (ii) ensure that ASU campus and facilities are designed to maximize \nenvironmental sustainability and climate resilience by adopting green building standards, energy- \nand water-saving systems, and climate adaptation measures. The preparation of a sustainable \ncampus and facility management strategy to reduce emissions and enhance energy and resource \nefficiency and climate resilience will be also supported. The TA will further assist ASU teams in \nexamining and determining appropriate information technology and other technology solutions to \n \n10 ADB. 2017.

Output  2:  Integrated  teaching,  learning,  and  career  development  management \nplatform designed. The TA will support research on the market for digital platforms that integrate \nlabor market intelligence (i.e., analysis and forecasting of demand for skills); learning and career \ndevelopment advisory services; learner performance monitoring; and curriculum, content, and \ninstructional strategy management. Based on the market research, the TA will assist ASU\u2019s \nmanagement, faculty, and administration teams in preparing functional and system requirements \nand specifications for ASU\u2019s teaching, learning, and career development management system \nintegrated with the digital campus platform, which will be used for managing and delivering skills \neducation and training programs aligned with the NSQF, as well as other advanced skills, career \ndevelopment, soft skills, and language skills programs to be established at ASU.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Skills  education  and  training  programs  and  applied  research  and \ndevelopment  projects  addressing infrastructure  and  industrial  development  needs in \nneighboring countries developed. The TA will support partnership activities between ASU and \nleading institutes, universities, and enterprises in India and abroad to develop curricula, training \nmaterials and facilities, assessments, and skills of faculty and staff members for skills education \nand  training  programs  and  applied  R&D  projects  that  address  infrastructure  and  industrial \ndevelopment needs in neighboring countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal). Fields of \ncommon interest such as regional connectivity (e.g., logistics); regional market development and \nintegration  (e.g.,  value-added  bamboo  products,  and  medical  and  wellness  tourism);  and \nenvironmental sustainability will be prioritized. Common modules on environmental sustainability \nand climate change to be integrated into all skills education and training programs at ASU will \nalso be developed, as well as career development, soft skills, and language skills programs. \nThrough partnership activities, the TA will also strengthen the capacity of leadership and staff \nmembers at ASU\u2019s international partnership office to develop, manage, and sustain partnerships, \nespecially with TVET and higher education institutions in neighboring countries. \n \n12.  Output 4: Capacity to support entrepreneurship and business startups; and micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises developed. The TA will support feasibility studies for the \nestablishment of incubator and accelerator programs and facilities for technology services, \napplied R&D, testing, and certification at ASU (in areas such as environmental sustainability) in \npartnership with leading institutes, universities, and enterprises in India and abroad to support \nentrepreneurship and business startups as well as MSMEs in Assam. Based on the studies, \ndetailed road maps to establish those programs and facilities that cater to the needs of local \nentrepreneurs, startups, and MSMEs for technology, digital, business, and skilling solutions will \nbe  prepared.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  preparation  of  an  entrepreneurial  competency \nframework and a plan for developing entrepreneurship education and support programs for the \nother faculties at ASU, as well as common entrepreneurship modules to be integrated into all \nskills education and training programs and resource materials for faculty and students. Further, \nthe  TA  will  build  the  capacity  of  leadership,  faculty,  and  staff  at  ASU\u2019s  office  of  industry \nengagement and commercial ventures to establish and manage networks of industry partners, \nalumni, business support, and funding organizations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.25 million, of which $1.00 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB and $0.15 \nmillion by the Climate Change Fund. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.
