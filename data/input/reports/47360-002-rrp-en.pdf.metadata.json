Pakistan  is  the  fifth  most  populous  country  in  the  world  with  an \nestimated  population  of  207  million  people,  and  the  most  urbanized  country  in  South  Asia. \nPakistan shares borders with Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Iran. Due \nto its  strategic  location,  it  has great  potential  to become  a regional  transport  and  logistics  hub \nproviding the People\u2019s Republic of China and the landlocked Central Asian countries with access \nto the Arabian Sea. Pakistan\u2019s economy is among the better performers in South Asia with an \nestimated gross  domestic  product  growth  rate  of  5.3%  in FY2017,  a substantial  increase from \n4.5% in FY20162. Pakistan\u2019s economy is largely driven by strong growth in domestic consumption, \nrecovery in agricultural production, and a marginal recovery in foreign direct investments; but is \nconstrained by an inefficient transport system with poor levels of service. \n \nKhyber  Pakhtunkhwa:  a  vulnerable  and  underperforming  economy.  Khyber \n4. \nPakhtunkhwa,  which  is  located  in  northwest  Pakistan,  is  geographically  the  smallest  of  the \ncountry\u2019s four provinces; however, it ranks third in terms of both population (about 30 million\u2014\n16% of the country\u2019s population) and economic production (accounting for 10.5% of Pakistan's \neconomy). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s economy is dominated by forestry (about 61% of the national \nforestry output); mining (20% of national output); agriculture (its main cash crops include wheat, \nmaize,  tobacco,  rice,  sugar  beets,  and  a  wide  variety  of  fruits  and  vegetables);  and  some \nmanufacturing.  These  economic  activities  require  a  reliable  transport  system  and  efficient \nconnectivity to lower transport costs and improve competitiveness. \n \n5. \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Afghanistan to the northwest, and is adjacent \nto the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the west. The province has faced severe crises due \nto militant activity, particularly during 2007\u20132009 along the Afghan border. The conflict intensified \nthe vulnerability of the region, which is already one of Pakistan\u2019s poorest and most disaster-prone, \nsubject  to  catastrophic  floods,  earthquakes,  and  other  natural  disasters.  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa \nlags other provinces across a wide range of social and economic indicators (this lag is even more \npronounced when viewed in terms of gender). The militants destroyed local livelihoods, caused \nlarge-scale  displacement,  damaged  infrastructure,  and  worsened  the  region\u2019s  business \nconnectivity with the rest of the country. Since 2012, the security situation has improved due to \nongoing military operations by the Pakistan Army. \n\n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  transaction  technical  assistance  for  preparing  the  Khyber \n\nPakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement Project (TA 9194-PAK). \n\n2   ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017 Update: Sustaining Development Through Public-Private Partnership. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nNeed for improved connectivity. Pakistan\u2019s transport sector contributes about 10% to \n6. \nits  gross  domestic  product  and  accounts  for  over  6%  of  employment  in  the  country. 3 Road \ntransport dominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in \nton-km  and 92%  of  passenger traffic  in passenger-km.  Dependence  on  road transport  is  even \nhigher  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.  The  province  also  provides  the  main  transit  corridor  to \nAfghanistan  across the Khyber  Pass.  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s  classified paved  road network  of \n15,102 km includes 1,878 km of national highways managed by the National Highway Authority, \n1,824 km of provincial highways4 managed by the Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority (PKHA), and \n11,400 km  of  district  roads  managed  by  the  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Communication  and Works \nDepartment. Provincial highways connect district centers with the national highway network, and \nplay  a  vital  role  in  the  province\u2019s  economic  development.  With  average  daily  traffic  counts  at \naround  3,000\u20138,000  vehicles,  provincial  highways  also  connect  provincial  administrative  and \ncommercial centers with district headquarters and market towns. They are vital in facilitating intra-\nprovincial trade and commerce; providing access to health, education, and other public services; \nand reducing poverty by creating jobs and business opportunities. \n \nDeteriorated  road  conditions.  Road  surface  conditions  and  riding  quality  are \n7. \ndeteriorating due to ageing infrastructure and poor asset management. Inadequate drainage is a \nmajor  cause  of  premature  road  failure.  The  pavement  condition  of  more  than  half  of  the  road \nnetwork  is  rated  poor  or  bad,  according  to  road condition  data  surveyed  in 2013.  A  significant \nmaintenance backlog exists, with about 700 km of provincial roads having a pavement condition \nindex  (PCI)  of  less  than 2;5 at  least  one-third of this  backlog requires  reconstruction,  while the \nremaining  sections  need  major  rehabilitation.  Low  technical  standards  and  inadequate  safety \nfeatures have contributed to road safety hazards, especially at intersections near built-up areas. \nRehabilitation interventions focused on road links in poor to bad condition will help reduce the \nmaintenance backlog, ease the maintenance financial burden, and improve the overall condition \nand safety of the provincial road network. \n \nOverloading  challenges.  Overloading,  a  common  challenge  in  Pakistan,  is  a  serious \n8. \nproblem in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to logging, quarrying, and mining traffic, especially in the \nprovince\u2019s  marble-producing  areas.  Although  light  vehicles  account  for  80%\u201390%  of  traffic  in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa, a 2013 traffic survey revealed that over 95% of trucks in all categories were \noverloaded, some as high as 100% above permissible load limits. Road in the center region of \nthe province carry the heaviest traffic while the southern region has the lowest traffic. Overloading \nreduces pavement design life and results in premature deterioration, often leading to catastrophic \nfailure. The PKHA has established two stationary weighbridges, and is investing in mobile vehicle \nweighing equipment; however, controlling overloading requires a multifaceted approach, such as \nregulatory overhaul, self-regulation by the trucking industry, selective enforcement with modern \ntechnology,  vehicle  taxation  to  encourage  the  replacement  of  rigid  single  axles  with  multi-axle \nconfigurations, overloading control at the source, and the use of stronger pavements based on \nactual axle loads. The project design acknowledges the actual axle load spectrum, and the PKHA \nhas begun enforcing overloading control measures at the source, such as at marble mines and \nfactories. \n \n\n                                                \n3  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. 2014. Pakistan 2025: One Nation, One \n\n4  Excluding 380 km of provincial highways located in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. \n5  PCI is an indicator of pavement performance for asphaltic roads that ranges between 0 (extremely poor) and 7 (newly \n\nVision. Islamabad. www.pc.gov.pk. \n\nconstructed and distress-free).  \n\n\fRoad  asset  management.  The  PKHA  established  a  road  asset  management  system \n9. \n(RAMS)  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)6 with  a  dedicated  RAMS  directorate \nwithin  the  PKHA.  A  basic  database,  including  road  inventory  data  and  condition  data,  was \nestablished with a Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4) interface. A falling \nweight deflectometer and profilometer were provided, and have been used to survey pavement \nconditions  and  collect  data.7   An  annual  maintenance  plan  for  FY2014\u2013FY2015  was  prepared \nwith the assistance of a consultant utilizing the RAMS. The assessment showed that the existing \nRAMS  should  be  enhanced  with  both  hardware  and  software  using  the  latest  technology,  an \nembedded  geographic  information  system,  and  staff  training.  The  RAMS  should  also  be \nexpanded  to cover  bridges and large  drainage structures,  road  safety  and traffic  management \ninfrastructure, and geotechnical infrastructure such as slope retaining structures, embankments, \nand tunnels. The PKHA will provide a dedicated annual budget allocation for data collection and \noperation expenditure of the RAMS. \n \n10. \nSustainable road maintenance. Road maintenance sustainability has been a challenge \nin Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Annual budget allocations for road maintenance and preservation have \nbeen insufficient to operate and maintain the road system at an acceptable service level. Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Communication and Works Department, including the PKHA, receives about 2.0%\u2013\n2.5% of the province\u2019s annual budget for the road sector, on average, but most of this allocation \nis spent on new road and bridge construction and upgrading works (especially during 2014\u20132017). \nExpenditure on road repairs and maintenance accounted for over 10% of total spending on roads \nin 2014\u20132015, but this fell to 8% in 2015\u20132016, and is expected to fall to around 6% in 2016\u2013\n2017. 8 The  PKHA  established  a  Road  Maintenance  Fund  with  financing  from  the  provincial \nbudget allocation (98%) and revenues generated from road tolls and leasing of property within \nrights-of-way  (2%).  The  government  is  also  promoting  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  road \nsector  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  road  investment  and  maintenance  under  long-term,  build-\noperate-transfer arrangements. The project will expand toll roads, increase tolling revenue, and \nhelp the PKHA increase its maintenance budget allocation. \n \n11. \nPerformance-based  maintenance.  Routine  and  periodic  maintenance  is  currently \ncarried out in small road sections about 100\u2013200 meters long, resulting in an uneven road surface \nfull  of  patches  that  disintegrate  with  the  movement  of  traffic.  Maintenance  (mostly  focused  on \nemergency repairs) is carried out by small contractors through contracts bid annually. The budget \nallocation for routine maintenance cannot be guaranteed; thus, large sections of the road network \ndo not receive regular systematic maintenance based on sound asset management practice. PBM \nis  a  relatively  new  approach  designed  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  road \nmaintenance. It changes the role of a contractor from that of executor to road asset manager, and \nthe contractor is paid on the basis of outputs or predefined service levels instead of inputs. PBM \nfocuses on incentives to encourage good performance and sustainable results under a multi-year \nmaintenance  contract.  The  project  includes  a  PBM  component  to  be  financed  by  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa to pilot two 5-year PBM contracts covering about 104 km of provincial roads that \nare still in fair to good condition. This will be the first time that PBM has been piloted in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa.  These  PBM  contracts  are  intended  to  maintain  high  road  serviceability,  while \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2004.

Profilometer is  a measuring \nto quantify its roughness. \n\n8  During  2016\u20132017,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  released  an  additional  $85  million  for  the  construction  of  the  Swat \nExpressway,  leading  to  an  approximately  250%  increase  in  the  PKHA\u2019s  budget  for  new  works  compared  with  \n2015\u20132016. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nensuring the durability of all road infrastructure elements: pavements, shoulders, slopes, drainage \nstructures, and road safety furniture. Based on the pilot results, PBM will be replicated to cover \nthe  entire  provincial  road  network.  This  PBM  experience  could  provide  a  road  maintenance \ncontracting model to be applied in other jurisdictions. \n \n12. \nPrevious  lessons  and experience.  The  project  design  incorporated  the  main  lessons \nfrom previous projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including a previous ADB-financed road project \n(footnote 6) and other road projects in the province financed by development partners such as \nthe  World  Bank  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  that  mainly  focus  on  flood \nemergency  assistance.  The  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  both  the  highest  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return,  and  security  conditions  (all  are  located  in  central  and  eastern  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa where security conditions are better and well-controlled). Advance procurement for \ncivil  works  and  consultant  recruitment  were  synchronized  with  project  preparation  to  minimize \nstart-up  delays.  The  civil  works  contracts  are  packaged  to  accommodate  the  capacity  of \ninternational and local bidders. The government agreed to allocate a dedicated fund in its annual \nbudget for upgrading, data collection, and operation of the RAMS. \n \n13. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s assistance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s transport \nsector has not only improved regional connectivity within the province, but also strengthened the \nPKHA\u2019s capacity on the RAMS, overloading control, and road safety improvement. With ADB\u2019s \nprevious assistance, the PKHA established a road maintenance unit to operate the RAMS and \nprocured portable weighbridges to control overloading. ADB will continue the policy dialogue with \nthe government on increasing road maintenance expenditure with a mandatory budget allocation; \nmodernizing and enhancing the RAMS with the latest technology (both hardware and software), \ntraining, and technical support; and improving maintenance efficiency by piloting PBM contracts. \nThe PBM contracts are expected to establish a successful case that can be replicated and scaled \nup in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other provinces. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  an  efficient  and  integrated  transport  network  in  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa established (footnote 3). The project\u2019s outcome will be efficiency and safety along \nkey sections of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s provincial road network improved.9 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nOutput 1: Provincial roads rehabilitated.  The project will rehabilitate eight road sections \nwith a total length of 214 km to relevant provincial highway standards, while improving road safety \nand  providing  climate  resilience  features  to  withstand  damage  and  disruption  from  natural \ndisasters (e.g., floods, landslides, and slope erosion). \n \n16. \nOutput  2:  The  Pakhtunkhwa  Highways  Authority\u2019s  institutional  capacity  on  road \nmaintenance  strengthened.  The  PKHA\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  through  pilot  PBM \ncontracts, enhancement of the RAMS,  the provision of maintenance equipment and  laboratory \nequipment, and training. \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n17. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $164 million (Table 1). \n\n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\fTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \n\nRoad rehabilitation \nInstitutional strengthening on road maintenance \nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Includes a performance-based maintenance pilot ($10 million), partial rehabilitation works ($11.5 million) including \ntaxes and duties ($5 million), and resettlement costs ($2.5 million) to be financed from government resources. \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges During Implementationd \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\n \n130.5 \n21.7 \n152.2 \n5.1 \n6.7 \n164.0 \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nb  In mid-2017 prices as of 31 August 2017. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at  3% for civil works.

Preliminary screening rated the project as being at medium risk of climate change \nimpacts,  primarily  flooding  risks.  A  further  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  was \nundertaken  during  project  preparation,  and  the  rehabilitation  strategy  focuses  on  improving \npavement  structure,  including  drainage,  slope  stability,  and  safety  enhancements.  All  road \nsections will follow existing alignments, with some sections widened to standard, 7.3-meter, two-\nlane  carriageways,  with  shoulders  of  varied  width  per  design  standards  (except  for  one  road, \nwhere  the  existing  four-lane  pavement  will  be  rehabilitated).  The  proposed  pavement  design \naligned with the results of the condition survey and falling weight deflectometer data, while taking \nthe  reuse  and  recycling  of  the  existing  pavement  into  consideration.  The  project  team  also \nsurveyed  the  road  sections  using the International  Road Assessment  Program methodology11, \nand found  that  some road  sections  have  a  low  (one-  or  two-star)  rating  with  significant  safety \nhazards, especially at junctions and built-up areas. The design will incorporate the recommended \nsafety measures to improve these high-risk sections to a three-star rating or better. The detailed \ndesign addressed climate change impacts by improving drainage facilities, stabilizing slopes with \nbio-engineering  measures  to  minimize  erosion,  and  ensuring  the  height  of  embankments  with \ndesign flood frequency. \n \n\n                                                \n11 International Road Assessment Program methodology is to inspect high-risk roads and develop Star Ratings and \n\nSafer Roads Investment Plans to help countries make road safe. \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic. The economic analysis confirms that the project is economically viable, with \nan economic internal rate of return of 15.6%, and a net present value of $98.0 million at a 9% \ndiscount  rate.  The  project\u2019s  economic  benefits  comprise  reduced  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance costs for the road agency, and vehicle operating cost and travel time savings for \nusers.  Economic  viability  is  robust  against  increases  in  capital  costs,  as  well  as  reductions  in \nbenefits. A review of the PKHA\u2019s financial position indicates that the province should be able to \nallocate sufficient funds for road maintenance to ensure that these assets can be sustained. \n \n24. \nFinancial. The project will reduce the 30% rehabilitation backlog, which currently takes \nup  80%  of  the  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  budget,  by  rehabilitating  road  sections  with  a \nminimal residual life, thereby reducing future reconstruction and maintenance costs. In FY2016, \nthe  PKHA  had  a  resource  envelope  of  about  PRs903  million  for  the  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance of provincial highways, versus an unconstrained need of about PRs3,298 million. \nOf  this,  80%  was  required  to  eliminate  the  maintenance  backlog  by  rehabilitating  700  km  of \nprovincial roads in the worst condition. If this maintenance backlog can be eliminated or largely \nreduced, the road network will be stabilized with no more than 5%\u20137% of the network requiring \nstrengthening  or  rehabilitation  each  year,  and  the  current  budget  envelope  of  about  PRs903 \nmillion should be sufficient for routine and functional periodic maintenance of provincial highways. \nTolling is being considered on four project roads with higher commercial traffic volumes before \nrehabilitation works are completed. Additional revenue from these tolls is expected to contribute \nfurther to the maintenance budget and the project\u2019s sustainability. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe PKHA was assessed as having sufficient capacity to manage procurement, financial \nmanagement,  and  project  implementation  functions,  including  maintaining  the  accounting \nsystems,  financial  controls,  and  audit  arrangements.  The  PKHA\u2019s  financial  management  pre-\nmitigation  risk  is  substantial,  and  an  action  plan  is  highlighted  in  the  Financial  Management \nsection of the PAM. The PKHA is experienced in the procurement and recruitment of consultants, \nas  mandated  by  the  provincial  government  to  plan  and  implement  the  development  and \nmaintenance  of  provincial  roads,  and  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment  procedures.  Further  training  on  strengthening  the  grievance  redress  mechanism, \nprocurement,  accountability,  and  contract  management  will  be  conducted  during  project \nimplementation. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n27. \nConsultations with local communities were held during field visits to the road sections. An \nanalysis  of  key  stakeholders\u2019  perceptions  of  and  concerns  about  the  project  shows  positive \nfeedback and no major social impacts. The main direct project beneficiaries will be agricultural \ntraders,  freight  forwarders,  transporters,  commuters,  and  those  living  and  working  along  the \nproject road sections. Indirect beneficiaries include large sections of the population who will gain \nincreased employment opportunities in trade and transport business as well as ready access to \nmarkets  and  resources  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa.  Local  populations  will  gain  employment \nopportunities  during  the  construction  and  operation  project  stages.  The  project  has  been \ncategorized as \u201csome gender elements,\u201d as it will benefit women by improving access to basic \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fsocial services such as health, education, and social networking facilities. Road safety features \nwill reduce accidents and fatalities. Key gender actions will include (i) consultations with separate \nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s groups to mitigate any negative project impacts; (ii) the rehabilitation of 20% \nof road sections with gender-sensitive design features (such as pedestrian sidewalks, rest areas \nfor families, and bus stops for women, children, and the elderly); (iii) capacity building of the PKHA \nin  social  safeguards  and  gender-sensitive  planning  and  the  implementation  of  road  sector \nprojects; and (iv) the provision of additional assistance to households headed by women as part \nof the resettlement plan. \n\nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  PKHA  prepared  a  consolidated  initial  environmental \nexamination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement  (2009). The potential environmental impacts are largely related to \nthe construction stage, and are temporary and site-specific. These include soil erosion and water \ncontamination, noise, vibration, air pollution, the felling of roadside trees, traffic disruptions, and \nimpacts pertaining to occupational and community health and safety. During operation, the project \nwill  have  potential  impacts  related  to  increased  noise  and  air  pollution  levels,  and  community \nsafety. Adequate mitigation measures were designed and will be implemented through the EMP. \nAs the PKHA\u2019s environmental safeguard capacity is limited, the EMP will include capacity building \nand  training  of  PIU  personnel  in environmental management.  An  environment  specialist  under \nthe construction supervision consultant will support the PIU in ensuring that the project complies \nwith  the  environmental  requirements  of  ADB  and  the  local  government.  Two  series  of  public \nconsultations were conducted in the project area in March\u2013April and June\u2013July 2017. The initial \nenvironmental examination and EMP were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 September 2017. \n\n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  project \nbecause  improvement  works  will  be  limited  to  existing  rights-of-way  owned  by  the  PKHA.  \nThe  rehabilitation  design  of  some  road sections whose carriageways  are  of  less-than-required \nwidth have been modified by reducing the proposed construction limit to the existing carriageway, \nalong with other technical solutions (e.g., traffic calming measures) to avoid impacting structures \nwithin the rights-of-way. A due diligence report was prepared to verify how the designs had been \nmodified  to  avoid  all  potential  impacts  on  structures.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF) was prepared to guide the PKHA in addressing any unforeseen land impact \nthat may arise during implementation due to contractor negligence or any unanticipated change \nin the road cross-sections. The LARF has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  and  it  has  been  agreed  that  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  in  the  event  of  unforeseen  impacts.  The  due  diligence  report  and  LARF  were \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  25  September  2017  and  will  be  closely  monitored  by  the  PIU \nduring construction. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  does  not  trigger  requirements  on \n30. \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement because no distinct ethnic minority \ncommunities are present in any of the project areas. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n31. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n                                                \n12 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe Government of Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa\u2019s insufficient budget \nfor the road sector and unbalanced \npublic investments (favoring road \nconstruction over road \nmaintenance) result in \nunsustainable road maintenance. \nThe PBM pilot cannot be \nimplemented due to the reluctance \nof the government and the local \ncontracting industry. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank will maintain policy dialogue with \nthe provincial government to increase its annual budget for road \nmaintenance. The target will be linked with the outcomes of the \nroad asset management system. Tolling is considered for some \nproject roads to increase the PKHA\u2019s revenue. The PBM pilot \nunder the project will test multiyear maintenance fund \ncommitments as part of the contract. \nThe PBM design considers local contractors\u2019 capacity, \nmaintenance culture, and political willingness. The design \ncustomized international practices to local conditions and \ninstitutional capacity. Several rounds of consultations and \nworkshops have been conducted with the PKHA and local \npotential contractors. \n\nPBM = performance-based maintenance, PKHA = Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n32. \nThe government and PKHA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
