It  will  (i)  improve  the  government\u2019s  capabilities  to  better  target  and  track \nfinancial inclusion efforts and enhance supporting infrastructure; (ii) directly increase access to \nfinance  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  and  underserved  segments \nusing  innovative  technology;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  digital  financial \nservices, data privacy, and consumer protection. More equitable and efficient access to financial \nproducts  and  services  will  also  help  mitigate  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  coronavirus  disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, foster recovery and the rebuilding of livelihoods, and prepare for future \neconomic  shocks.  Financial  inclusion  therefore  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  government\u2019s \nNational Economic Recovery (PEN) program in response to COVID-19. The program aligns with \nthe  government\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2020\u20132024  and  the  second \nstrategic  pathway  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndonesia, 2020\u20132024.1 It contributes to the ADB Strategy 2030 priorities of addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities (operational priority 1), accelerating progress in gender equality \n(operational priority 2), and tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability (operational priority 3).2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nBackground. The Indonesian economy has grown by an annual average of 5.0% from \n3. \n2000 to 2019, and made impressive progress in poverty reduction. The number of people living \nbelow the national poverty line declined by more than half, from 23.4% in 1999 to 9.2% in 2019.3 \nHowever, the country did not meet its targeted poverty rate of 7%\u20138% under the National Medium-\nTerm Development Plan, 2015\u20132019. A sizable portion of the population clusters only marginally \nabove the national poverty line, and about one-fifth of the population remains poor or near poor \nand is highly vulnerable to shocks, including climate shocks.4 The severity of poverty varies widely \nacross  this  highly  diverse  country,  as  does  the  quality  of  infrastructure  and  the  availability  of \nservices. The Gini coefficient improved from 0.41 in 2014 to 0.38 in 2019, but Indonesia remains \none of the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia (footnote 3). While inequality is prevalent in \nurban areas, poverty rates are higher in rural and remote areas. Eastern Indonesia has very high \nrates of rural poverty, with development having bypassed many indigenous communities. Women \nare often marginalized and suffer higher rates of poverty and inequality. \n \n4. \nReducing poverty and inequality has become even more challenging because of the global \neconomic recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy is projected to contract \nin 2020 by 1%, Indonesia\u2019s worst performance in 21 years, and downside risk to the forecast is \n\n \n\n1  Government  of Indonesia.  2020.

As  the  COVID-19  pandemic  takes  away  jobs  and  worsens  poverty,  it  complicates \naddressing  barriers  to  financial  inclusion.  Focusing  on  financially  excluded  segments  of  the \npopulation  is  particularly  urgent  since  they  are  the  least  likely  to  have  high-quality,  affordable \nhealth care and adequate savings or access to credit to help them weather an economic downturn. \nIn addition, their informal livelihoods are particularly vulnerable to interruption under COVID-19. \n \n5. \nTo  address  the  challenge  of  poverty  and  inequality\u2014and  in  response  to the  COVID-19 \npandemic\u2014the government is pursuing a comprehensive program with a strong focus on financial \ninclusion. 8  In  this  regard,  internationally  comparable  Global  Findex  data  show  Indonesia \nadvancing more quickly than its peers in East Asia and the Pacific (Figure 1).9 The Global Findex \nsurvey reports the percentage of adults in Indonesia with a bank account rising markedly from \n20% in 2011 to 36% in 2014 and 49% in 2017. The recent Financial Inclusion Insights Survey by \nthe  Indonesian  National  Council  for  Financial  Inclusion  (Dewan  Nasional  Keuangan  Inklusif  or \nDNKI) shows a similar trend, with 56% of adults holding an account in 2018.10 However, by this \nmeasure  of financial  inclusion,  Indonesia still  lagged  Malaysia  at  85%  and  Thailand  at  82%  in \n2017. \n \n\nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and Selected Southeast Asian Peers \nA.

The Global Findex Database 2017. Washington, DC. \n10 The national Financial Inclusion Insights Survey highlighted that 70.30% of adults used a product or service offered \nby a formal financial institution in 2018, and the national Financial Literacy and Inclusion Survey put this figure at \n76.19% in 2019, indicating that some household members share bank accounts.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \nt\n\nn\nu\no\nc\nc\na\n\n \nk\nn\na\nb\n\n \nl\n\na\nm\nr\no\n\nf\n \n\no\n\nt\n \ns\ns\ne\nc\nc\na\n\n \n\ni\n\ng\nn\nv\na\nh\n\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nl\n\na\nu\np\no\np\n\n \nt\nl\n\nu\nd\na\n\n \nf\n\n \n\no\n%\n\n\faccounts  held  by  low-income  people.  However,  the  number  of  Indonesians  excluded  from  the \nformal financial system remains significant at 51% (footnote 9). The degree of exclusion varies \nsignificantly  across  regions  and  by  gender  and  other  social  factors.  Moreover,  despite \nimprovement,  many  people  remain  poorly  served  by  the  formal  finance  sector,  their  financial \naccess falling short of financial depth. \n \n7. \nDevelopment constraints. Providing financial services to all is a unique challenge in a \ncountry  as  geographically  dispersed  and  socio-culturally  diverse  as  Indonesia.  For  financial \ninclusion  to  be  meaningful,  holders  of  bank  accounts  must  use  them  effectively  and  cultivate \nbanking  habits  to  improve  their  lives.  Moreover,  they  should  have  access  to  an  array  of  high-\nquality and affordable financial products and services to meet their evolving needs. To address \nthe dual challenges of poverty and inequality toward achieving sustainable development over the \nlong term, more must be done to make financial products and services more accessible and truly \nusable for populations heretofore excluded from the formal financial system. Government efforts \nto this end are hampered by (i) inadequate data and supporting infrastructure, (ii) limited access \nto  finance  for  MSMEs  and  other  underserved  segments,  and  (iii)  low  financial  literacy  and \ninadequate consumer protection. \n\n \n8. \nInadequate data and supporting infrastructure. Comprehensive data\u2014consistent, up-\nto-date,  and  disaggregated\u2014are  critical  to  designing  and  implementing  a  cohesive  and  well-\ncoordinated approach to financial inclusion. Existing datasets are often inconsistent and fall back \non account ownership as a proxy for financial inclusion. Existing data cloak other dimensions of \nfinancial  inclusion  as  well,  such  as  disparate  market  segments.  More  in-depth  examination  is \nneeded  of  both  demand  for and  the  supply  of  financial  products  and  services  for MSMEs  and \nunderserved individuals and households. Greater focus is needed on disaggregating data by sex \nand  analysis  of  regional  disparities.  In  addition,  proper  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation \nmechanisms  are  critical  to  assessing  the  outcomes  of  the  government\u2019s  financial  inclusion \nprograms.  Supporting  infrastructure  is  unable  to  facilitate  full  integration  of  the  unbanked  and \nunderbanked into the formal financial system. While real-time payment infrastructure is in place, \nthe existing system does not allow micro payment processing involving very small sum of money, \nwhich challenges its usefulness for driving digital financial inclusion. The number of branchless \nbanking agents has expanded but opening a bank account through a branchless banking agent \nmay take more than 5 days because account-opening forms still need to be physically transported. \nConsequently, only a few financial service providers prioritize customer acquisition through their \nfield agents. The national biometric identification project has registered and collected biometric \ndata on more than 100 million Indonesians, yet the database can be accessed by only a limited \nnumber of market participants for only a few uses. This precludes using biometric data to enable \ndigital and remote personal identity verification with sufficient certainty to satisfy stringent know-\nyour-customer  requirements.  Further,  this  prevents  a  link  between  biometric  identification  and \nelectronic  know  your  customer  (e-KYC),  which  could  facilitate  speedier  account  opening  and \nelectronic payments.  \n \n9. \nInsufficient  focused  efforts  to  support  smaller  enterprises  and  underserved \nsegments. In 2018, Indonesia\u2019s 64 million MSMEs accounted for a large portion of all businesses \nand employed most of the workforce. Women ran nearly half of them.11 Lack of access to finance \nis a key challenge for MSMEs, as fewer than a quarter of them can get a loan to start and grow a \nbusiness. As a result, most are micro enterprises that struggle to grow to small or medium-sized \nstatus.  The  finance  sector  in  Indonesia  is  dominated  by  intermediated  lending  disbursed  by \ntraditional  banks  and  remains  less  efficient  than  its  regional  peers.  Credit  information  and  risk \n\n11 Statistics Indonesia. 2019. Potential for Increasing Performance Micro and Small Enterprises. Jakarta. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement systems are underdeveloped, and technology has not been fully exploited to reach \nMSMEs. Proactive and focused efforts are needed to improve institutional credit delivery  in an \nintegrated,  timely,  and  efficient  manner  through  technology-driven  solutions.  In  addition, \nsignificant regional disparities remain in access to a range of financial products for savings, credit, \nremittance, payment, investment, and insurance. Similar disparities persist between population \ngroups,  with  women,  youth,  and  rural  communities  particularly  at  risk  of  being  left  behind. \nAccording to Global Findex, in 2017, only 18.4% of adult population borrowed from a financial \ninstitution or used a credit card. For women, the rate was 18.0% and for youth 8.0%,12  though \nyouth are half of the population. Closing these remaining gaps in financial access, including the \ngender gap, is a major priority in line with the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u2013\n2024. \n \n10. \nNeed for enhanced financial literacy, consumer protection, and financial technology \nsupervision. The emerging financial technology (fintech) industry has fostered innovations and \nopportunities that complement the role of banks and capital market intermediaries, but it has also \nmade financial products and services more complex and heightened risks to consumers and the \nfinance  sector.  Many  consumers,  especially  women,  lack  financial  experience  and  the \ncompetence that comes with it. A survey in 2019 found the financial literacy rate in Indonesia to \nbe  only  38.03%. 13  Fintech  industry  expansion  and  a  corresponding  increase  in  consumer \ncomplaints  of  abusive  practices  in  digital  financial  services  indicate  a  need  for  consumers  to \nacquire greater digital financial literacy and for the enactment of an industry code of conduct to \nwhich  all  registered  and  licensed  fintech  companies  must  adhere.14 Consumer  complaint  and \nredress mechanisms need to be enhanced further and awareness of them raised among women. \nIndonesia has six dispute-resolution institutions, one each for banking, capital markets, insurance, \nmultifinance, guarantees, and pension funds. However, no institution covers microfinance, and \nemerging financial products do not fit neatly into any one sector, which gives rise to the need for \na unified independent dispute-resolution mechanism that covers the entire finance sector. Finally, \nfinancial regulators need to improve the required systems and strengthen their capacity for market \nconduct  monitoring  and  supervision.  As  regulators  try  to  both  facilitate  and  shape  the \ndevelopment  of  a  dynamic  fintech  industry,  new  oversight  tools  such  as  regulatory technology \n(regtech) and supervisory technology (suptech) are needed to enable and enhance supervision \nand regulation while making it more cost-effective and data-intensive. \n \n11. \nADB engagement and development partner coordination. ADB has supported finance \nsector development in Indonesia since 2002. Its engagement in financial inclusion in Indonesia \nbegan  with  support  for  developing  microfinance  to  expand  access  for  MSMEs  under  the \nEarthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project in 2005.15 Since then, ADB has supported \nthe government\u2019s financial inclusion agenda through various programs and technical assistance \n(TAs). It has coordinated initiatives in the area of financial inclusion with German Development \nCooperation through KfW, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation, the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, Women\u2019s World Banking, and the \nInternational  Labour  Organization,  as  well  as  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  on  policy \ndialogue, fiscal projections, and macroeconomic analysis. \n \n \n\n \n\n12 The Global Findex 2017 defines youth as aged between 15\u201324.  \n13 Financial Services Authority Indonesia. 2019.

Its  long-term  engagement  in  the \nfinance  sector  informed  program  design  through  four  key  lessons:  (i)  in  the  finance  sector, \ndedicated programs should focus on one subsector at a time for better impact; (ii) financial stability \nand  capital  market  development  need  to  be  complemented  with  reform  to  improve  financial \naccess for underserved segments and thereby maximize the economic impact of development; \n(iii) reform to enhance financial inclusion should be holistic, requiring complementary measures \nin  financial  literacy,  consumer  protection,  and  fintech;  and  (iv)  an  overarching  framework  for \nfintech is required to ensure both sector development and consumer protection.19 \n \nB. \n \n13. \nGovernment  reform  program.  The  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan, \n2020\u2013 2024 reinforces financial inclusion as a priority that includes increasing MSME access to \ncredit. Presidential Regulation No. 82 of 2016 on the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion set \npriorities and approaches to expand financial inclusion during 2016\u20132019 in the form of five pillars: \n(i)  financial  education,  (ii)  public  property  rights,  (iii)  intermediation  facility  and  distribution \nchannels, (iv) financial services in the government sector, and (v) consumer protection.20 These \npillars  are  supported  by  three  enablers  of  conducive  policies  and  regulations,  supporting  \n(i)  infrastructure, (ii)  information  technology,  and  (iii)  effective  organization  and  implementation \nmechanisms. Key achievements under the strategy included tripling the number of e-money and \nbranchless  banking  agents  and  introducing  such  initiatives  as  cashless  social  assistance \nprograms. The DNKI coordinates implementation and monitoring of all financial inclusion efforts \nand is chaired by the President of Indonesia and led by the Coordinating Ministry of Economic \nAffairs in collaboration with 13 implementing agencies. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n16 The OJK regulates and supervises financial services. It was established in 2012 as a unified authority to regulate the \ncapital market, banking, and nonbank financial institutions under Act No. 21 of 2011, supported by ADB. The OJK \nreplaced the Capital Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency and assumed the responsibility of Bank \nIndonesia for bank supervision. \n\n17 ADB. 2019.

The program comprises two subprograms designed to deepen \n14. \nADB\u2019s  engagement  and  continue  its  support  under  the  Financial  Market  Development  and \nInclusion Program, through which ADB became engaged in financial inclusion (footnote 17). The \nprogram supports new tech-enabled opportunities to accelerate and enhance financial inclusion, \nespecially under the COVID-19 pandemic. A programmatic approach is selected as it provides \ncontinuing  engagement  to  support  complex reform  with  flexibility  to  accommodate  stakeholder \nfeedback.  The  program  supports  ongoing  government  efforts  toward  financial  inclusion  by \nfocusing on three key reform areas: (i) tools and infrastructure for financial inclusion, (ii) access \nto finance for MSMEs and marginalized groups including women and youth, and (iii) supervision \nand consumer protection measures for responsible financial inclusion. Fintech is a crosscutting \narea. Financial inclusion reform will boost government efforts to mitigate COVID-19 impacts by \nleveraging  technology  to  foster  financial  innovation  and  strengthening  consumer  protection.  A \nthird  subprogram  may  be  considered,  depending  on  demand  from  the  government  and \nachievements under subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n15. \nTools and infrastructure for financial inclusion. This reform area supports evidence-\nbased policies to promote a cohesive and coordinated approach to financial inclusion and improve \nsupporting  infrastructure.  There  are  six  key  accomplishments  under  subprogram  1.  First,  the \ngovernment  completed  comprehensive  national  and  regional  data  collection  exercises  with \nparticular focus on women and youth, and issued the new National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, \n2020\u20132024. The regulation provided the legal basis to set financial inclusion targets to promote \ndeepening  of  financial  services.  The  ministries  of  women\u2019s  empowerment  and  of  youth  were \nadded as new members of the DNKI. Second, the government launched a financial access map \nto  further  identify  the  needs  of  financially  underserved  people  including  women;  improve  the \ndesign,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  financial  inclusion  strategies  and  action  plans;  and \nenable better targeting of future initiatives based on their needs. Third, the government launched \nIndonesia\u2019s  Payment  System  Blueprint  2025  to  reinforce  the  integration  of  the  national  digital \neconomy  and  finance.  The  existing  policy  to  increase  the  use  of  digital  transactions  was \nstrengthened  to  enhance  transaction  efficiency  toward  providing  a  more  inclusive  payment \necosystem.  Fourth,  the  government  pilot  tested  the  use  of  national  biometric  identification  to \nfacilitate e-KYC requirements, make it easier to open a bank account, and enhance the delivery \nof digital financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. Fifth, the OJK developed a 5-year \ndigital finance innovation road map and action plan to encourage greater use of technology. Sixth, \nwithin this framework, an innovative geospatial financial service mobile application was launched \nto allow the unbanked and underbanked to locate branchless banking agents and other financial \nservice  providers  in  real  time.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  expand  the  financial \naccess map and launch a complementary sex-disaggregated financial inclusion and literacy data \ndashboard. Using the data collected under subprogram 1, the government will adopt a time-bound \nfinancial  inclusion  action  plan  for  2020\u20132024  with  gender  targets  to  deepen women\u2019s financial \ninclusion. The government will also promote the greater use of fintech, fully automate the know-\nyour-customer  process,  and  require  financial  service  providers  to  register  on  the  geospatial \nfinancial service mobile application. \n \n16. \nAccess  to  finance  for  smaller  enterprises  and  marginalized  groups  including \nwomen  and  youth.  This  reform  area  provides  greater  access  to  finance  for  MSMEs,  which \ncomplements  government  efforts  to  support  MSMEs  affected  by  COVID-19,  and  other \nmarginalized segments, in particular women and youth.21 Under subprogram 1, the government \n\n21 To  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  MSMEs,  the  government  introduced  subsidized \ninterest for MSME credit. In March 2020, the OJK issued a regulation that relaxed requirements to enable banks to \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\faccomplished  five  key  reforms.  First,  the  OJK  adopted  measures  to  reduce  information \nasymmetry  and  allow  prospective  lenders  to  better  assess  credit  risk  posed  by  MSMEs.  For \nexample, the OJK adopted a regulatory framework to regulate alternative credit scoring used by \nfintech entities, enabling a comprehensive credit scoring mechanism and making credit access \npossible for the unbanked and underbanked, notably women. Second, the OJK established the \nEastern  Indonesia  Financial  Innovation  Lab  (EIFIL)  for  regional  development  banks.  In \npartnership  with  the  fintech  industry,  this  initiative  will  identify  and  deploy  more  innovative \ntechnology solutions that extend MSME access to credit, especially in rural areas. The EIFIL will \ninitially  introduce  an  innovation  accelerator  program  for  regional  development  banks  in  Nusa \nTenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, and Maluku focusing on agriculture and \ntourism  MSMEs  owned  by  women  and  youth  and  affected  by  COVID-19.  Third,  the  OJK, \nsupported by the Ministry of Home Affairs, adopted a strategic road map and expanded the Team \nfor Acceleration of Regional Financial Access to address regional disparities. Fourth, recognizing \nthe need for proactive measures to address gender gaps, the government launched the world\u2019s \nfirst standalone financial inclusion strategy for women. This strategy includes a time-bound action \nplan with targets, the first national definition of businesses owned and/or led by women, and a \nwomen\u2019s financial inclusion network at the level of the DNKI. Fifth, similarly, to enhance financial \nservices for youth, the OJK launched a dedicated financial inclusion strategy and rolled out an \ninnovative  program  of  youth  financial  inclusion  ambassadors  to  function  as  influencers  on \nuniversities and over social media toward enhancing financial awareness. Under subprogram 2, \nthe  government  will  issue  regulations to  adopt  alternative  credit  scoring  to  further  mitigate risk \nposed by lending to MSMEs. The OJK will expand the EIFIL and, in partnership with the fintech \nindustry, provide further support to MSMEs. The government will implement dedicated financial \ninclusion  plans  covering  small  businesses  owned  by  women  and  youth,  backed  by  specific \nstrategies developed through data analysis conducted under the first reform area. \n \n17. \nSupervision and consumer protection measures for responsible financial inclusion. \nThis  reform  area  strengthens  finance  sector  governance,  consumer  protection,  and  financial \nliteracy in response to the rising use of fintech and an expected increase in insolvency and over-\nindebtedness during the COVID-19 crisis. Subprogram 1 had four key accomplishments. First, \nthe government created a strategic framework for adopting regtech and suptech. This will anchor \nefforts  to  accelerate  data-intensive  risk  assessment  and  enable  supervisory,  regulatory,  and \npolicy  decision-making  facilitated  by  artificial  intelligence,  machine  learning,  natural  language \nprocessing,  and  data  analytics.  Second,  the  government  enhanced  regulation  of  the  fintech \nindustry by appointing the Indonesia Fintech Association (Asosiasi Fintech Indonesia or AFTECH) \nas  a  self-regulatory  organization.  AFTECH  will  complement  OJK  efforts  to  supervise  market \nconduct  and  protect  digital  financial  consumers.  Third,  to  enhance  consumer  protection,  the \ngovernment  established a  coordinated  effort to merge  the  separate  dispute-resolution  centers. \nFourth,  the  government  pilot  tested  an  innovative  financial  education  and  career  exploration \nprogram  for  Indonesian  youth  called  Y-Bank,  supported  by  more  than  20  domestic  and \ninternational financial institutions. The Y-Bank curriculum is designed to be gender sensitive and \nencourage more female participation. Under subprogram 2, the OJK will adopt comprehensive \nregtech and suptech frameworks. In addition, AFTECH, with OJK\u2019s authorization, will issue a code \nof ethics and conduct for the fintech industry. Six separate dispute-resolution institutions will be \nconsolidated into a unified body to provide access to more effective financial dispute resolutions. \nFinally, the government will implement international security and privacy standards for financial \ninstitutions and fintech entities and support the further expansion of the Y-Bank program. \n \n\nrestructure existing MSME loans and provide new loans up to the equivalent of $600,000 based on a debtor\u2019s credit \nhistory. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n18. \nThe program\u2019s impact aligns with the aim under the National Medium-Term Development \nPlan, 2020\u20132024 for Indonesia to become an upper-middle-income country that is prosperous, \nfair, and sustainable by 2024 (footnote 1). The program outcome will be the promotion of a more \ninclusive  financial  service  sector.22 Subprogram  1 supports the  government\u2019s  ongoing financial \ninclusion agenda by better targeting financially underserved people and introducing the policy and \ntechnology necessary to enable better access to formal financial products and services, improve \ntheir quality, and increase their use. Subprogram 2 will implement and expand reforms introduced \nunder subprogram 1. Access to a bank account enables the use of additional financial services, \nand credit opens up economic opportunity. Financial literacy has lasting benefits on behavior and \nis likely to become self-reinforcing with more experience.  Regulatory reform will promote more \ncompetition among financial service providers, which should improve product features and lower \nprices  paid  by  MSMEs  and  underserved  people.  Increased  financial  inclusion  will  therefore \nimprove productivity and efficiency and narrow income inequality.23  \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n19. \nThe government has requested a loan of $500 million from ADB ordinary capital resources \nto help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. Using the straight-line repayment method, \nthe average maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The indicative \nloan amount for subprogram 2 is  also $500 million. German development cooperation through \nKfW is cofinancing subprogram 1 with \u20ac200 million equivalent. The government\u2019s projected total \ngross borrowing requirement for 2020 has increased from $42.4 billion to $107.0 billion because \nof  COVID-19  impacts.  To  finance  this  need,  the  government  plans  to  raise  $82.4  billion \ndomestically through debt issuance in rupiah (increased from $32.9 billion prior to COVID-19), \n$16.5 billion through debt issuance in foreign currencies, $0.2 billion through domestic loans, and \n$7.9 billion through official development assistance.24 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. The OJK, the Coordinating Ministry \nof  Economic  Affairs,  and  Bank  Indonesia  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  Implementation \nwould be from May 2019 to December 2020 for subprogram 1 and January 2021 to December \n2022 for subprogram 2. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nSafeguards. In compliance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n21. \nis category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. It is expected to \nhave  no  environmental  or  social  impacts  as  defined  in  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). \n \n\n \n\n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n23 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB budget support in 2020 includes the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program ($1.5 billion, \nplus cofinancing of over $1.5 billion), the proposed Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program, Subprogram 3 ($500 \nmillion, plus cofinancing of $425 million), and the proposed program. Discussions continue with other development \npartners to support the government\u2019s financing needs.  \n\n \n\n\fPoverty  and  social.  COVID-19  pandemic  disruption  of  employment  and  livelihoods  is \n22. \nplacing particularly heavy burdens on the most vulnerable in society and worsening poverty. An \nestimated 5.2 million Indonesians could lose their jobs, and nearly 10.0 million will be pushed into \npoverty in 2020. As those falling into poverty are the households most excluded by the formal \nfinancial  system,  their  financial  inclusion  can  help  defend  them  from  future  poverty  and \nvulnerability. Reform under the program covers digital finance innovation, payment systems, e-\nKYC, alternative credit scoring, regional financial access, and alternate dispute resolution, which \nwill facilitate and accelerate the responsible provision of financial services to heretofore excluded \npeople, creating opportunity and reducing poverty. \n \n23. \nGender. Subprogram 1 is categorized as gender equity as a theme with proactive actions \nand targets designed to strengthen and promote women\u2019s economic resilience and empowerment \nby  tackling  key  gender  challenges.  Despite  Indonesia  being  one  of  the  few  countries  with  a \nreverse gender gap in bank account ownership, persistent gender gaps remain in access to and \nuse of many financial services. For example, while the bank account ownership rate is 51% for \nwomen and 46% for men, men are 6% more likely to have an active account. Further, a sizeable \ngap in labor force participation sees only 51% of women employed as opposed to 83% of men. \nBusinesses  owned  or  led  by  women  tend  to  be  very  small  and  struggle  to  survive  and  grow \nbecause  their  access  to  markets  and  networks  is  relatively  limited.  COVID-19  has  deepened \nthese challenges because women\u2019s jobs and businesses are concentrated in industries hard hit \nby the pandemic, such as tourism, and women now have more unpaid care and domestic work, \nlimiting the time available for paid work. Subprogram 1 will provide a comprehensive response to \ngender-specific  challenges  to  financial  inclusion  by  (i)  developing  and  launching  the  first  ever \nNational  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy  for  Women,  which  sets  out  clear  targets  and  actions  for \nnarrowing gaps in entrepreneurship, digital finance, insurance and pensions, financial literacy and \neducation, consumer protection, data collection, and support for women caregivers; (ii) adopting \na national definition of businesses owned or led by women as a first step toward developing more \ngender-focused  policy  support  in  subprogram  2;  (iii)  establishing  a  national  women\u2019s  financial \ninclusion  network  to  promote  inter-ministerial  cooperation  and  collaboration  with  development \npartners;  (iv)  focusing  especially  on  women\u2019s  businesses  in  the  EIFIL;  and  (v)  including  the \nMinistry of Women\u2019s Empowerment to support the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, 2020\u2013\n2024. Subprogram 2 will build on these actions by supporting women\u2019s businesses in the fintech \nindustry, promoting access to markets through gender-responsive procurement guidelines, and \nconducting pilots and new research on women\u2019s unpaid caregiving. \n \n24. \nGovernance.  Indonesia  has  demonstrated  sound  macroeconomic  management.  From \n2015 to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, economic expansion averaged 5.0%, inflation was \ncarefully  managed,  and  the  fiscal  deficit  equaled  on  average  2.3%  of  gross  domestic  product. \nIndonesia  has  effectively  coped  with  past  external  shocks  through  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement. 25  Coordinated  macroeconomic  management  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Bank \nIndonesia,  and  the  OJK  remains  strong  in  response  to  external  uncertainties.  In  addition, \nassessment  of  Indonesia\u2019s  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  confirms  that  the \ngovernment  has  established  a  strong  legal  and  regulatory  framework  aligned  with  most \ninternational  standards  on  good  governance.  International  standards  on  public  financial \nmanagement have been adopted for accounting, budget classification, and internal control and \naudit.26 A 2017 government regulation mandates coordination between the National Development \n\n \n\n25 IMF. 2019.

The ADB Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nRisk  and  mitigating  measures.  Two  key  risks  have  been  identified. 27  First, \n25. \nmacroeconomic instability and a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic may change political priorities, \nleaving  the  government  with  fewer  resources  to  implement  financial  inclusion  reform. \nMacroeconomic instability is mitigated by Indonesia\u2019s sound macroeconomic fundamentals and \nappropriate  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  The  government  has  acted  to  mitigate  the  impact  of \nCOVID-19 by temporarily lifting the fiscal deficit ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product and by \nproviding additional support to the health-care sector, social protection, and economic assistance, \nespecially  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  policy \nresponse  to  the  pandemic through  a  countercyclical  support  loan,  TA,  and  conducting  regular \npolicy dialogue. Second, there is potential risk from the emerging fintech industry and its possible \ndisruption of safety, security, and stability in the finance sector. The OJK remains responsible for \ndeveloping and supervising the fintech industry, including through a regulatory sandbox. Reform \nunder the program will address other risks to financial exclusion and fintech industry supervision. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n26. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nagreement. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  agreed  to  the  following \n27. \ncondition:  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  is  conditional  upon  the  government\u2019s  issuance  of  a \nPresidential Regulation on its National Financial Inclusion Strategy. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n28. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Promoting  Innovative  Financial  Inclusion \nProgram; and \nthe  loan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nPromoting  Innovative  Financial  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n18 November 2020\n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nTo become an upper-middle-income country that is prosperous, fair, and sustainable by 2024 (National \nMedium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the \nreform \nA more \ninclusive \nfinancial \nservice sector \npromoted \n\nReform areas \nunder \nsubprogram 1 \n1.
