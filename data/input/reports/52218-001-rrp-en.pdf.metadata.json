THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Promoting Innovative Financial Inclusion Program and (ii) a policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the Promoting Innovative Financial \nInclusion Program. \n \n2.  The programmatic approach supports the government\u2019s ongoing efforts to further enhance \nfinancial inclusion. It will (i) improve the government\u2019s capabilities to better target and track \nfinancial inclusion efforts and enhance supporting infrastructure; (ii) directly increase access to \nfinance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and underserved segments \nusing innovative technology; and (iii) strengthen the regulatory framework for digital financial \nservices, data privacy, and consumer protection. More equitable and efficient access to financial \nproducts and services will also help mitigate the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, foster recovery and the rebuilding of livelihoods, and prepare for future \neconomic shocks. Financial inclusion therefore will play an important role in the government\u2019s \nNational Economic Recovery (PEN) program in response to COVID-19. The program aligns with \nthe  government\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2020\u20132024  and  the  second \nstrategic pathway of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nIndonesia, 2020\u20132024.1 It contributes to the ADB Strategy 2030 priorities of addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities (operational priority 1), accelerating progress in gender equality \n(operational priority 2), and tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability (operational priority 3).2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Background. The Indonesian economy has grown by an annual average of 5.0% from \n2000 to 2019, and made impressive progress in poverty reduction. The number of people living \nbelow the national poverty line declined by more than half, from 23.4% in 1999 to 9.2% in 2019.3 \nHowever, the country did not meet its targeted poverty rate of 7%\u20138% under the National Medium-\nTerm Development Plan, 2015\u20132019. A sizable portion of the population clusters only marginally \nabove the national poverty line, and about one-fifth of the population remains poor or near poor \nand is highly vulnerable to shocks, including climate shocks.4 The severity of poverty varies widely \nacross this highly diverse country, as does the quality of infrastructure and the availability of \nservices. The Gini coefficient improved from 0.41 in 2014 to 0.38 in 2019, but Indonesia remains \none of the most unequal countries in Southeast Asia (footnote 3). While inequality is prevalent in \nurban areas, poverty rates are higher in rural and remote areas. Eastern Indonesia has very high \nrates of rural poverty, with development having bypassed many indigenous communities. Women \nare often marginalized and suffer higher rates of poverty and inequality. \n \n4.  Reducing poverty and inequality has become even more challenging because of the global \neconomic recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy is projected to contract \nin 2020 by 1%, Indonesia\u2019s worst performance in 21 years, and downside risk to the forecast is \n \n1  Government of Indonesia. 2020.

As  the  COVID-19  pandemic  takes  away  jobs  and  worsens  poverty,  it  complicates \naddressing barriers to financial inclusion. Focusing on financially excluded segments of the \npopulation is particularly urgent since they are the least likely to have high-quality, affordable \nhealth care and adequate savings or access to credit to help them weather an economic downturn. \nIn addition, their informal livelihoods are particularly vulnerable to interruption under COVID-19. \n \n5.  To address the challenge of poverty and inequality\u2014and in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic\u2014the government is pursuing a comprehensive program with a strong focus on financial \ninclusion.8 In  this  regard,  internationally  comparable  Global  Findex  data  show  Indonesia \nadvancing more quickly than its peers in East Asia and the Pacific (Figure 1).9 The Global Findex \nsurvey reports the percentage of adults in Indonesia with a bank account rising markedly from \n20% in 2011 to 36% in 2014 and 49% in 2017. The recent Financial Inclusion Insights Survey by \nthe Indonesian National Council for Financial Inclusion (Dewan Nasional Keuangan Inklusif or \nDNKI) shows a similar trend, with 56% of adults holding an account in 2018.10 However, by this \nmeasure of financial inclusion, Indonesia still lagged Malaysia at 85% and Thailand at 82% in \n2017. \n \nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and Selected Southeast Asian Peers \nA.

Access to a transaction account is the first step toward broader financial inclusion. In fact, \nrecent progress in financial inclusion can be attributed to the development of \u201cgovernment to \nperson\u201d payments including social transfers, which increased the number of basic savings \n \n5  ADB. 2020.

Jakarta. \n8  Financial inclusion is broadly defined as individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial \nproducts and services that meet their needs and are delivered in a responsible and sustainable manner. \n9  World Bank. 2018. The Global Findex Database 2017. Washington, DC. \n10 The national Financial Inclusion Insights Survey highlighted that 70.30% of adults used a product or service offered \nby a formal financial institution in 2018, and the national Financial Literacy and Inclusion Survey put this figure at \n76.19% in 2019, indicating that some household members share bank accounts.  \n ", "3 \naccounts held by low-income people. However, the number of Indonesians excluded from the \nformal financial system remains significant at 51% (footnote 9). The degree of exclusion varies \nsignificantly  across  regions  and  by  gender  and  other  social  factors.  Moreover,  despite \nimprovement, many people remain poorly served by the formal finance sector, their financial \naccess falling short of financial depth. \n \n7.  Development constraints. Providing financial services to all is a unique challenge in a \ncountry as geographically dispersed and socio-culturally diverse as Indonesia. For financial \ninclusion to be meaningful, holders of bank accounts must use them effectively and cultivate \nbanking habits to improve their lives. Moreover, they should have access to an array of high-\nquality and affordable financial products and services to meet their evolving needs. To address \nthe dual challenges of poverty and inequality toward achieving sustainable development over the \nlong term, more must be done to make financial products and services more accessible and truly \nusable for populations heretofore excluded from the formal financial system. Government efforts \nto this end are hampered by (i) inadequate data and supporting infrastructure, (ii) limited access \nto finance for MSMEs and other underserved segments, and (iii) low financial literacy and \ninadequate consumer protection. \n \n8.  Inadequate data and supporting infrastructure. Comprehensive data\u2014consistent, up-\nto-date, and disaggregated\u2014are critical to designing and implementing a cohesive and well-\ncoordinated approach to financial inclusion. Existing datasets are often inconsistent and fall back \non account ownership as a proxy for financial inclusion. Existing data cloak other dimensions of \nfinancial inclusion as well, such as disparate market segments. More in-depth examination is \nneeded of both demand for and the supply of financial products and services for MSMEs and \nunderserved individuals and households. Greater focus is needed on disaggregating data by sex \nand analysis of regional disparities. In addition, proper reporting, monitoring, and evaluation \nmechanisms are critical to assessing the outcomes of the government\u2019s financial inclusion \nprograms. Supporting infrastructure is unable to facilitate full integration of the unbanked and \nunderbanked into the formal financial system. While real-time payment infrastructure is in place, \nthe existing system does not allow micro payment processing involving very small sum of money, \nwhich challenges its usefulness for driving digital financial inclusion. The number of branchless \nbanking agents has expanded but opening a bank account through a branchless banking agent \nmay take more than 5 days because account-opening forms still need to be physically transported. \nConsequently, only a few financial service providers prioritize customer acquisition through their \nfield agents. The national biometric identification project has registered and collected biometric \ndata on more than 100 million Indonesians, yet the database can be accessed by only a limited \nnumber of market participants for only a few uses. This precludes using biometric data to enable \ndigital and remote personal identity verification with sufficient certainty to satisfy stringent know-\nyour-customer requirements. Further, this prevents a link between biometric identification and \nelectronic know your customer (e-KYC), which could facilitate speedier account opening and \nelectronic payments.  \n \n9.  Insufficient  focused  efforts  to  support  smaller  enterprises  and  underserved \nsegments. In 2018, Indonesia\u2019s 64 million MSMEs accounted for a large portion of all businesses \nand employed most of the workforce. Women ran nearly half of them.11 Lack of access to finance \nis a key challenge for MSMEs, as fewer than a quarter of them can get a loan to start and grow a \nbusiness. As a result, most are micro enterprises that struggle to grow to small or medium-sized \nstatus. The finance sector in Indonesia is dominated by intermediated lending disbursed by \ntraditional banks and remains less efficient than its regional peers. Credit information and risk \n \n11 Statistics Indonesia. 2019. Potential for Increasing Performance Micro and Small Enterprises. Jakarta. \n ", "4 \nmanagement systems are underdeveloped, and technology has not been fully exploited to reach \nMSMEs. Proactive and focused efforts are needed to improve institutional credit delivery in an \nintegrated,  timely,  and  efficient  manner  through  technology-driven  solutions.  In  addition, \nsignificant regional disparities remain in access to a range of financial products for savings, credit, \nremittance, payment, investment, and insurance. Similar disparities persist between population \ngroups, with women, youth, and rural communities particularly at risk of being left behind. \nAccording to Global Findex, in 2017, only 18.4% of adult population borrowed from a financial \ninstitution or used a credit card. For women, the rate was 18.0% and for youth 8.0%,12  though \nyouth are half of the population. Closing these remaining gaps in financial access, including the \ngender gap, is a major priority in line with the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u2013\n2024. \n \n10.  Need for enhanced financial literacy, consumer protection, and financial technology \nsupervision. The emerging financial technology (fintech) industry has fostered innovations and \nopportunities that complement the role of banks and capital market intermediaries, but it has also \nmade financial products and services more complex and heightened risks to consumers and the \nfinance  sector.  Many  consumers,  especially  women,  lack  financial  experience  and  the \ncompetence that comes with it. A survey in 2019 found the financial literacy rate in Indonesia to \nbe  only  38.03%.13 Fintech  industry  expansion  and  a  corresponding  increase  in  consumer \ncomplaints of abusive practices in digital financial services indicate a need for consumers to \nacquire greater digital financial literacy and for the enactment of an industry code of conduct to \nwhich all registered and licensed fintech companies must adhere.14 Consumer complaint and \nredress mechanisms need to be enhanced further and awareness of them raised among women. \nIndonesia has six dispute-resolution institutions, one each for banking, capital markets, insurance, \nmultifinance, guarantees, and pension funds. However, no institution covers microfinance, and \nemerging financial products do not fit neatly into any one sector, which gives rise to the need for \na unified independent dispute-resolution mechanism that covers the entire finance sector. Finally, \nfinancial regulators need to improve the required systems and strengthen their capacity for market \nconduct  monitoring  and  supervision.  As  regulators  try  to  both  facilitate  and  shape  the \ndevelopment of a dynamic fintech industry, new oversight tools such as regulatory technology \n(regtech) and supervisory technology (suptech) are needed to enable and enhance supervision \nand regulation while making it more cost-effective and data-intensive. \n \n11.  ADB engagement and development partner coordination. ADB has supported finance \nsector development in Indonesia since 2002. Its engagement in financial inclusion in Indonesia \nbegan  with  support  for  developing  microfinance  to  expand  access  for  MSMEs  under  the \nEarthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project in 2005.15 Since then, ADB has supported \nthe government\u2019s financial inclusion agenda through various programs and technical assistance \n(TAs). It has coordinated initiatives in the area of financial inclusion with German Development \nCooperation through KfW, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation, the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, Women\u2019s World Banking, and the \nInternational Labour Organization, as well as with the International Monetary Fund on policy \ndialogue, fiscal projections, and macroeconomic analysis. \n \n \n \n12 The Global Findex 2017 defines youth as aged between 15\u201324.  \n13 Financial Services Authority Indonesia. 2019.

Lessons. Most recently, ADB supported the government and the Financial Services \nAuthority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK)16 under the Financial Market Development and \nInclusion Program17 and TA for Promoting Innovative Financial Inclusion18 to enhance access to \nfinance through innovative approaches, financial literacy, and consumer protection. ADB support \nhelped the government establish the DNKI, promulgate digital finance regulations, and expand \nbranchless banking, laying the foundation for the program. Its long-term engagement in the \nfinance sector informed program design through four key lessons: (i) in the finance sector, \ndedicated programs should focus on one subsector at a time for better impact; (ii) financial stability \nand capital market development need to be complemented with reform to improve financial \naccess for underserved segments and thereby maximize the economic impact of development; \n(iii) reform to enhance financial inclusion should be holistic, requiring complementary measures \nin financial literacy, consumer protection, and fintech; and (iv) an overarching framework for \nfintech is required to ensure both sector development and consumer protection.19 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  Government  reform  program.  The  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan, \n2020\u20132024 reinforces financial inclusion as a priority that includes increasing MSME access to \n \ncredit. Presidential Regulation No. 82 of 2016 on the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion set \npriorities and approaches to expand financial inclusion during 2016\u20132019 in the form of five pillars: \n(i)  financial  education,  (ii)  public  property  rights,  (iii)  intermediation  facility  and  distribution \nchannels, (iv) financial services in the government sector, and (v) consumer protection.20 These \npillars  are  supported  by  three  enablers  of  conducive  policies  and  regulations,  supporting  \n(i) infrastructure, (ii) information technology, and (iii) effective organization and implementation \nmechanisms. Key achievements under the strategy included tripling the number of e-money and \nbranchless  banking  agents  and  introducing  such  initiatives  as  cashless  social  assistance \nprograms. The DNKI coordinates implementation and monitoring of all financial inclusion efforts \nand is chaired by the President of Indonesia and led by the Coordinating Ministry of Economic \nAffairs in collaboration with 13 implementing agencies. \n \n16 The OJK regulates and supervises financial services. It was established in 2012 as a unified authority to regulate the \ncapital market, banking, and nonbank financial institutions under Act No. 21 of 2011, supported by ADB. The OJK \nreplaced the Capital Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency and assumed the responsibility of Bank \nIndonesia for bank supervision. \n17 ADB. 2019.

The program comprises two subprograms designed to deepen \nADB\u2019s engagement and continue its support under the Financial Market Development and \nInclusion Program, through which ADB became engaged in financial inclusion (footnote 17). The \nprogram supports new tech-enabled opportunities to accelerate and enhance financial inclusion, \nespecially under the COVID-19 pandemic. A programmatic approach is selected as it provides \ncontinuing engagement to support complex reform with flexibility to accommodate stakeholder \nfeedback.  The  program  supports  ongoing  government  efforts  toward  financial  inclusion  by \nfocusing on three key reform areas: (i) tools and infrastructure for financial inclusion, (ii) access \nto finance for MSMEs and marginalized groups including women and youth, and (iii) supervision \nand consumer protection measures for responsible financial inclusion. Fintech is a crosscutting \narea. Financial inclusion reform will boost government efforts to mitigate COVID-19 impacts by \nleveraging technology to foster financial innovation and strengthening consumer protection. A \nthird  subprogram  may  be  considered,  depending  on  demand  from  the  government  and \nachievements under subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n15.  Tools and infrastructure for financial inclusion. This reform area supports evidence-\nbased policies to promote a cohesive and coordinated approach to financial inclusion and improve \nsupporting infrastructure. There are six key accomplishments under subprogram 1. First, the \ngovernment  completed  comprehensive  national  and  regional  data  collection  exercises  with \nparticular focus on women and youth, and issued the new National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, \n2020\u20132024. The regulation provided the legal basis to set financial inclusion targets to promote \ndeepening of financial services. The ministries of women\u2019s empowerment and of youth were \nadded as new members of the DNKI. Second, the government launched a financial access map \nto further identify the needs of financially underserved people including women; improve the \ndesign, implementation, and monitoring of financial inclusion strategies and action plans; and \nenable better targeting of future initiatives based on their needs. Third, the government launched \nIndonesia\u2019s Payment System Blueprint 2025 to reinforce the integration of the national digital \neconomy  and  finance.  The  existing  policy  to  increase  the  use  of  digital  transactions  was \nstrengthened to enhance transaction efficiency toward providing a more inclusive payment \necosystem. Fourth, the government pilot tested the use of national biometric identification to \nfacilitate e-KYC requirements, make it easier to open a bank account, and enhance the delivery \nof digital financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. Fifth, the OJK developed a 5-year \ndigital finance innovation road map and action plan to encourage greater use of technology. Sixth, \nwithin this framework, an innovative geospatial financial service mobile application was launched \nto allow the unbanked and underbanked to locate branchless banking agents and other financial \nservice providers in real time. Under subprogram 2, the government will expand the financial \naccess map and launch a complementary sex-disaggregated financial inclusion and literacy data \ndashboard. Using the data collected under subprogram 1, the government will adopt a time-bound \nfinancial inclusion action plan for 2020\u20132024 with gender targets to deepen women\u2019s financial \ninclusion. The government will also promote the greater use of fintech, fully automate the know-\nyour-customer process, and require financial service providers to register on the geospatial \nfinancial service mobile application. \n \n16.  Access  to  finance  for  smaller  enterprises  and  marginalized  groups  including \nwomen and youth. This reform area provides greater access to finance for MSMEs, which \ncomplements  government  efforts  to  support  MSMEs  affected  by  COVID-19,  and  other \nmarginalized segments, in particular women and youth.21 Under subprogram 1, the government \n \n21 To mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on MSMEs, the government introduced subsidized \ninterest for MSME credit. In March 2020, the OJK issued a regulation that relaxed requirements to enable banks to \n \n ", "7 \naccomplished  five  key  reforms.  First,  the  OJK  adopted  measures  to  reduce  information \nasymmetry and allow prospective lenders to better assess credit risk posed by MSMEs. For \nexample, the OJK adopted a regulatory framework to regulate alternative credit scoring used by \nfintech entities, enabling a comprehensive credit scoring mechanism and making credit access \npossible for the unbanked and underbanked, notably women. Second, the OJK established the \nEastern  Indonesia  Financial  Innovation  Lab  (EIFIL)  for  regional  development  banks.  In \npartnership with the fintech industry, this initiative will identify and deploy more innovative \ntechnology solutions that extend MSME access to credit, especially in rural areas. The EIFIL will \ninitially introduce an innovation accelerator program for regional development banks in Nusa \nTenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, and Maluku focusing on agriculture and \ntourism MSMEs owned by women and youth and affected by COVID-19. Third, the OJK, \nsupported by the Ministry of Home Affairs, adopted a strategic road map and expanded the Team \nfor Acceleration of Regional Financial Access to address regional disparities. Fourth, recognizing \nthe need for proactive measures to address gender gaps, the government launched the world\u2019s \nfirst standalone financial inclusion strategy for women. This strategy includes a time-bound action \nplan with targets, the first national definition of businesses owned and/or led by women, and a \nwomen\u2019s financial inclusion network at the level of the DNKI. Fifth, similarly, to enhance financial \nservices for youth, the OJK launched a dedicated financial inclusion strategy and rolled out an \ninnovative  program  of  youth  financial  inclusion  ambassadors  to  function  as  influencers  on \nuniversities and over social media toward enhancing financial awareness. Under subprogram 2, \nthe government will issue regulations to adopt alternative credit scoring to further mitigate risk \nposed by lending to MSMEs. The OJK will expand the EIFIL and, in partnership with the fintech \nindustry, provide further support to MSMEs. The government will implement dedicated financial \ninclusion plans covering small businesses owned by women and youth, backed by specific \nstrategies developed through data analysis conducted under the first reform area. \n \n17.  Supervision and consumer protection measures for responsible financial inclusion. \nThis reform area strengthens finance sector governance, consumer protection, and financial \nliteracy in response to the rising use of fintech and an expected increase in insolvency and over-\nindebtedness during the COVID-19 crisis. Subprogram 1 had four key accomplishments. First, \nthe government created a strategic framework for adopting regtech and suptech. This will anchor \nefforts to accelerate data-intensive risk assessment and enable supervisory, regulatory, and \npolicy decision-making facilitated by artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language \nprocessing, and data analytics. Second, the government enhanced regulation of the fintech \nindustry by appointing the Indonesia Fintech Association (Asosiasi Fintech Indonesia or AFTECH) \nas a self-regulatory organization. AFTECH will complement OJK efforts to supervise market \nconduct and protect digital financial consumers. Third, to enhance consumer protection, the \ngovernment established a coordinated effort to merge the separate dispute-resolution centers. \nFourth, the government pilot tested an innovative financial education and career exploration \nprogram  for  Indonesian  youth  called  Y-Bank,  supported  by  more  than  20  domestic  and \ninternational financial institutions. The Y-Bank curriculum is designed to be gender sensitive and \nencourage more female participation. Under subprogram 2, the OJK will adopt comprehensive \nregtech and suptech frameworks. In addition, AFTECH, with OJK\u2019s authorization, will issue a code \nof ethics and conduct for the fintech industry. Six separate dispute-resolution institutions will be \nconsolidated into a unified body to provide access to more effective financial dispute resolutions. \nFinally, the government will implement international security and privacy standards for financial \ninstitutions and fintech entities and support the further expansion of the Y-Bank program. \n \n \nrestructure existing MSME loans and provide new loans up to the equivalent of $600,000 based on a debtor\u2019s credit \nhistory. \n ", "8 \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n18.  The program\u2019s impact aligns with the aim under the National Medium-Term Development \nPlan, 2020\u20132024 for Indonesia to become an upper-middle-income country that is prosperous, \nfair, and sustainable by 2024 (footnote 1). The program outcome will be the promotion of a more \ninclusive financial service sector.22 Subprogram 1 supports the government\u2019s ongoing financial \ninclusion agenda by better targeting financially underserved people and introducing the policy and \ntechnology necessary to enable better access to formal financial products and services, improve \ntheir quality, and increase their use. Subprogram 2 will implement and expand reforms introduced \nunder subprogram 1. Access to a bank account enables the use of additional financial services, \nand credit opens up economic opportunity. Financial literacy has lasting benefits on behavior and \nis likely to become self-reinforcing with more experience. Regulatory reform will promote more \ncompetition among financial service providers, which should improve product features and lower \nprices paid by MSMEs and underserved people. Increased financial inclusion will therefore \nimprove productivity and efficiency and narrow income inequality.23  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n19.  The government has requested a loan of $500 million from ADB ordinary capital resources \nto help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. Using the straight-line repayment method, \nthe average maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The indicative \nloan amount for subprogram 2 is also $500 million. German development cooperation through \nKfW is cofinancing subprogram 1 with \u20ac200 million equivalent. The government\u2019s projected total \ngross borrowing requirement for 2020 has increased from $42.4 billion to $107.0 billion because \nof  COVID-19  impacts.  To  finance  this  need,  the  government  plans  to  raise  $82.4  billion \ndomestically through debt issuance in rupiah (increased from $32.9 billion prior to COVID-19), \n$16.5 billion through debt issuance in foreign currencies, $0.2 billion through domestic loans, and \n$7.9 billion through official development assistance.24 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency. The OJK, the Coordinating Ministry \nof Economic Affairs, and Bank Indonesia will be the implementing agencies. Implementation \nwould be from May 2019 to December 2020 for subprogram 1 and January 2021 to December \n2022 for subprogram 2. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n21.  Safeguards. In compliance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. It is expected to \nhave no environmental or social impacts as defined in the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). \n \n \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n23 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB budget support in 2020 includes the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program ($1.5 billion, \nplus cofinancing of over $1.5 billion), the proposed Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program, Subprogram 3 ($500 \nmillion, plus cofinancing of $425 million), and the proposed program. Discussions continue with other development \npartners to support the government\u2019s financing needs.  \n ", "9 \n22.  Poverty and social. COVID-19 pandemic disruption of employment and livelihoods is \nplacing particularly heavy burdens on the most vulnerable in society and worsening poverty. An \nestimated 5.2 million Indonesians could lose their jobs, and nearly 10.0 million will be pushed into \npoverty in 2020. As those falling into poverty are the households most excluded by the formal \nfinancial  system,  their  financial  inclusion  can  help  defend  them  from  future  poverty  and \nvulnerability. Reform under the program covers digital finance innovation, payment systems, e-\nKYC, alternative credit scoring, regional financial access, and alternate dispute resolution, which \nwill facilitate and accelerate the responsible provision of financial services to heretofore excluded \npeople, creating opportunity and reducing poverty. \n \n23.  Gender. Subprogram 1 is categorized as gender equity as a theme with proactive actions \nand targets designed to strengthen and promote women\u2019s economic resilience and empowerment \nby tackling key gender challenges. Despite Indonesia being one of the few countries with a \nreverse gender gap in bank account ownership, persistent gender gaps remain in access to and \nuse of many financial services. For example, while the bank account ownership rate is 51% for \nwomen and 46% for men, men are 6% more likely to have an active account. Further, a sizeable \ngap in labor force participation sees only 51% of women employed as opposed to 83% of men. \nBusinesses owned or led by women tend to be very small and struggle to survive and grow \nbecause their access to markets and networks is relatively limited. COVID-19 has deepened \nthese challenges because women\u2019s jobs and businesses are concentrated in industries hard hit \nby the pandemic, such as tourism, and women now have more unpaid care and domestic work, \nlimiting the time available for paid work. Subprogram 1 will provide a comprehensive response to \ngender-specific challenges to financial inclusion by (i) developing and launching the first ever \nNational Financial Inclusion Strategy for Women, which sets out clear targets and actions for \nnarrowing gaps in entrepreneurship, digital finance, insurance and pensions, financial literacy and \neducation, consumer protection, data collection, and support for women caregivers; (ii) adopting \na national definition of businesses owned or led by women as a first step toward developing more \ngender-focused policy support in subprogram 2; (iii) establishing a national women\u2019s financial \ninclusion network to promote inter-ministerial cooperation and collaboration with development \npartners; (iv) focusing especially on women\u2019s businesses in the EIFIL; and (v) including the \nMinistry of Women\u2019s Empowerment to support the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, 2020\u2013\n2024. Subprogram 2 will build on these actions by supporting women\u2019s businesses in the fintech \nindustry, promoting access to markets through gender-responsive procurement guidelines, and \nconducting pilots and new research on women\u2019s unpaid caregiving. \n \n24.  Governance. Indonesia has demonstrated sound macroeconomic management. From \n2015 to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, economic expansion averaged 5.0%, inflation was \ncarefully managed, and the fiscal deficit equaled on average 2.3% of gross domestic product. \nIndonesia  has  effectively  coped  with  past  external  shocks  through  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement.25 Coordinated macroeconomic management by the Ministry of Finance, Bank \nIndonesia,  and  the  OJK  remains  strong  in  response  to  external  uncertainties.  In  addition, \nassessment of Indonesia\u2019s public expenditure and financial accountability confirms that the \ngovernment  has  established  a  strong  legal  and  regulatory  framework  aligned  with  most \ninternational  standards  on  good  governance.  International  standards  on  public  financial \nmanagement have been adopted for accounting, budget classification, and internal control and \naudit.26 A 2017 government regulation mandates coordination between the National Development \n \n25 IMF. 2019.

The ADB Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n25.  Risk  and  mitigating  measures.  Two  key  risks  have  been  identified. 27  First, \nmacroeconomic instability and a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic may change political priorities, \nleaving  the  government  with  fewer  resources  to  implement  financial  inclusion  reform. \nMacroeconomic instability is mitigated by Indonesia\u2019s sound macroeconomic fundamentals and \nappropriate monetary and fiscal policies. The government has acted to mitigate the impact of \nCOVID-19 by temporarily lifting the fiscal deficit ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product and by \nproviding additional support to the health-care sector, social protection, and economic assistance, \nespecially for the poor and vulnerable. ADB is also supporting the government\u2019s fiscal policy \nresponse to the pandemic through a countercyclical support loan, TA, and conducting regular \npolicy dialogue. Second, there is potential risk from the emerging fintech industry and its possible \ndisruption of safety, security, and stability in the finance sector. The OJK remains responsible for \ndeveloping and supervising the fintech industry, including through a regulatory sandbox. Reform \nunder the program will address other risks to financial exclusion and fintech industry supervision. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n26.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \n27.  In addition to the standard assurances, the government has agreed to the following \ncondition: the effectiveness of the loan is conditional upon the government\u2019s issuance of a \nPresidential Regulation on its National Financial Inclusion Strategy. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Promoting  Innovative  Financial  Inclusion \nProgram; and \n(ii)  the loan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nPromoting Innovative Financial Inclusion Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n18 November 2020\n \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nTo become an upper-middle-income country that is prosperous, fair, and sustainable by 2024 (National \nMedium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with   Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the  By 2022:    Macroeconomic \nreform  a.
