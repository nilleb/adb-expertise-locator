The objective \nof the facility is to support the Government of Bangladesh in advancing the preparation of road \nand railway projects by financing feasibility studies, detailed design, and other preparatory works. \nThese projects will improve transport connectivity and facilitate multimodal transport in the country \nand South Asia. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROJECT READINESS FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBangladesh  economy.  Bangladesh,  with  a  population  of  165  million,  has  been \nexperiencing  robust  annual  economic  growth  of  5%  or  higher  since  fiscal  year  (FY)  2004. \nBangladesh\u2019s  annual  economic  growth  of  7.9%  in  FY  2018  was  the  highest  among  Asian \ncountries,  and  it  is  forecasted  to  further  grow  by  8.1%  in  FY2019  and  8.0  %  in  FY2020.1 The \nproportion of population living below the national poverty line decreased from 31.5% in 2010 to \n24.3%  in  2016,  although  this  was  still  the  highest  proportion  among  South  Asian  countries.2 \nForeign trade is a vital engine of the country\u2019s economic growth. Foreign merchandise trade in \nBangladesh  recorded  a  480%  increase  in  value  from  2000  to  2017.3 This  indicates  that  the \ncountry has the potential to grow further as a major exporter of labor-intensive products, including \ngarments.  Expansion  of  exports  is  expected  to  bring  about  economic  growth,  resulting  in \nincreased  incomes  that  will  contribute  to  boosting  domestic  consumption.  In  addition,  the \nproximity of Bangladesh to neighboring Southeast Asia provides the country with good prospects \nof becoming a regional trading hub. \n \n4. \nTransport network in Bangladesh. Bangladesh\u2019s transport network consists of roads, \nrailways, inland waterways, seaports, and civil aviation. Among these, road is the predominant \nsubsector  with  a  modal  share  of  over  70%  for  passenger  traffic  and  60%  for  freight. 4  The \ngovernment estimates that national road traffic volume is growing at an average rate of above \n10% per year.5 Rail is considered a safer, more reliable, and environmentally friendly transport \nmode in the country. Rail transport is also steadily increasing in traffic volume for passenger and \ncargo. Chattogram Port, formerly called Chittagong Port, is the national gateway port handling \nmore than 90% of the country\u2019s international cargo, and is the busiest container port in the Bay of \nBengal.  It  is  expected  that  international  container  cargo  volume  will  increase  to  10.2  million \ntwenty-foot equivalent units in 2040.6  \n \n\nin Asia\u2019s Cities.

Twenty-foot  equivalent  units  are  used  to  count \n\ncontainer volume; a 40-foot container box is counted as two twenty-foot equivalent units. \n\n \n\n\fTransport connectivity for an optimized network. Bangladesh\u2019s transport network is a \n5. \nfundamental and critical infrastructure that supports the country\u2019s economic activities, including \ninternational  trade.  Insufficient  transport  infrastructure  results  in  increased  costs  and  transport \ntime,  reduced  competitiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  economy,  and  impeded  economic \nopportunities. Transport demand is expanding rapidly nationwide because of Bangladesh\u2019s young \nand  growing  population,  and  steady  economic  development.  Thus,  the  government  has  been \nsubstantially investing in all subsectors to strengthen Bangladesh\u2019s transport network and support \nthe efficient, safe and sustainable movement of people and goods in the country and across the \nregion.  \n \n6. \nImprovements in transport connectivity that will link subsectors are necessary towards an \nintegrated  transport  network.  Insufficient  transport  connectivity  in  the  country  has  led  to  a \ndisproportionate reliance on roads, causing congestion and inconvenience to users. Promoting \nmultimodal transport and optimized modal share will alleviate unbalanced transport demands in \nthe  country.  For  example,  utilizing  freight  trains  and  inland  waterways  for  long-haul  freight \ntransport between Dhaka and Chattogram Port is a potential solution to alleviate the congestion. \nHowever,  this  requires  adequate  transport  connectivity  with  the  road  network  at  intermodal \ntransshipment facilities such as inland container depots and inland waterway terminals.  \n \n7. \nArterial transport corridors. Because of rapidly growing demand, the main road and rail \ncorridors  in  Bangladesh  face  severe  capacity  shortages.  Given  that  road  and  railway  are \nfundamental components of an integrated transport network, the alleviation of congestion along \narterial  transport  corridors  is  urgently  needed.  In  tandem  with  the  improvement  of  transport \nconnectivity,  arterial  transport  corridors  need  to  be  strengthened  through  upgrades  as  well  as \nthrough the construction of bypass roads and connecting roads. \n \n8. \nTransport connectivity and intra-subregional trade. Intra-subregional trade in South \nAsia is less active compared with that in other subregions such as the Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  and  the  European  Union.7 The  relatively  low  volume  of  intra-subregional  trade \namong South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) countries is partly attributed to \ninsufficient  transport  connectivity,  and  incomplete  transport  network.  Subregional  transport \ncorridors,  including  the  SASEC  road  corridors  and  the  Trans-Asian  Railway  network,  will  link \nBangladesh  with  neighboring  countries  through  border  crossing  points  and  land  ports.  The \ncorridors  will  provide  access  to  international  markets  and  economic  opportunities  not  only  for \nBangladesh, but also for neighboring countries through Bangladesh. However, international road \nand  rail  corridors  are  still  being  developed,  and  border  crossing  points  and  land  ports  are  still \nphysically constrained because of insufficient road and rail connectivity, although the government \nhas declared 23 land ports. \n \n9. \nGovernment  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  prioritizes  the \nimprovement  of  the  multimodal  transport  network,  utilization  of  rail  in  long-haul  freight  traffic, \npromotion  of  regional  connectivity,  and  reduction  of  urban  traffic  congestion,  among  others \n(footnote  4).  The  use  of  a  long-haul  freight  train  between  Dhaka  and  Chattogram  Port  is \nparticularly promoted by the government. Bangladesh Railway has established a container freight \ncompany and plans to expand the container freight yard next to Chattogram Port. Pilot operation \nof an international container train between Bangladesh and India was also conducted in 2018. \nThe Bangladesh Land Port Authority has declared 23 land ports as of March 2019, including six \n\n7  Intraregional  trade  as  a  share  of  total  trade  is  63.9%  for  the  European  Union  and  22.8%  for  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations,  compared  to  an  intra-subregional  trade  share  of  5.0%  for  South  Asia  Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) countries. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fland ports operated by the private sector. ADB is currently discussing with relevant government \nagencies about the ensuing support for land port and border management as another project. \n \n10. \nFacility  to  support  project  preparation.  The  preparation  of  such  projects  to  facilitate \ntransport connectivity among different subsectors has lagged behind actual development needs, \nand financial support is needed to advance this. In parallel with the government\u2019s plan to optimize \nthe country\u2019s transport network and to strengthen competitiveness of the economy, the PRF will \nsupport project preparation in the following areas: (i) road and rail connectivity of ports, land ports, \nand border crossing points; (ii) road and rail connectivity of intermodal transshipment facilities, \nincluding inland container depots and inland container terminals; (iii) strengthening of corridors, \nincluding bypasses, connected roads, and alternate routes; and (iv) sector-wide improvements, \nincluding safety, traffic management, and maintenance. Projects will be  selected in line with the \nproject  selection  criteria,  including  urgency  of  the  needs,  viability  for  future  financing,  and \ndevelopment  coordination. 8  The  PRF  will  advance  the  preparation  of  ensuing  projects  by \nfinancing feasibility studies, detailed design, and other preparatory works. \n \nADB strategy and value addition. The PRF was newly institutionalized as an innovative \n11. \nfinancing  modality  in  2018    to  ensure  a  high  level  of  implementation readiness.  The  proposed \nfacility meets the strategic objectives of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  particularly  by  (i)  easing  infrastructure  constraints  in \ntransport and urban development, (ii) creating conditions for greater private sector participation \nto  attract  investment,  and  (iii)  helping  Bangladesh  take  advantage  of  its  location  as  a regional \ntransport  and trade  hub.9 ADB\u2019s  engagement  will  complement  strategies  of  other  development \npartners  by  exploring  the  use  of  a  sector-wide  approach  and  pursuing  comprehensive  policy \ndialogues  with  the  government.  The  facility  will  also  expedite  the  preparation  of  projects  for \nregional cooperation and integration in line with the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025.10 In \naddition,  the  facility  is  aligned  with  the  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  as  it  will \ncontribute to the: (i) development of green and inclusive infrastructure as well as the reduction of \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  in  transport;  (ii)  reducing  inequality  access  to  opportunities  and \npromoting women\u2019s economic empowerment; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration.11 The \nfacility is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2020\u20132022.12  \n \nB. \n \n12.   Output:  Feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  and  other  preparatory  works  for \nensuing projects completed. All preparatory works will be done to satisfy ADB\u2019s due diligence \nrequirements. The facility will assess risks of ensuing projects related to gender, labor, and other \nsocial issues during the preparation of the feasibility study and detailed design in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and other guidelines, as well as government guidelines \nand regulations. Participation of private sector in ensuing projects will be preliminarily assessed.  \n \n13. \nEnvironmental impact assessments or initial environmental examinations, as applicable, \nwill  be  prepared  along  with  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  and  environmental \nmanagement plans for ensuing projects.

Ensuing projects will be selected from the list to \nimprove transport connectivity and facilitate multimodal transport. These investments are in line \nwith recent government priorities, including subregional cooperation and integration, intermodal \nconnection, and strengthening of industries. Most of the required investments (candidate projects) \nare identified in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (footnote 4) or the Railway Sector Master Plan toward \n2030.17 The detailed design will consider climate change impact, gender, environment, and other \nrequirements.  The  application  of  high-level technology  will  be  explored  during  implementation. \nIndividual consultants will be mobilized to support the executing agencies in reviewing detailed \ndesign and other preparatory works by consulting firms to assure the quality of outputs, especially \non high-level and new technology. Consulting services are packaged to bundle multiple candidate \nprojects of the same subsector for consistency in preparation of projects and to determine priority \namong them. Such procurement packaging, combined with a selection method that places greater \nweight on the quality of proposals, will aim to achieve value for money. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  and  Bangladesh  Railway  will  be  the \nexecuting  agencies  of  the  facility.  Both  the  RHD  and  Bangladesh  Railway  have  implemented \nADB-funded projects and are familiar with ADB\u2019s project financial accounting and disbursement \nprocedures. One finance (account) official will be designated in each project implementation unit. \nIn  addition,  the  RHD  and  Bangladesh  Railway  have  participated  in  workshops  to  learn  good \npractices  of  financial  management  systems.  The  overall  financial  management  capacity  is \nadequate,  but  given  the  country  risk  rating,  the  project  risk  is  considered  moderate.  The  main \nfinancial management risks are related to external audit, internal audit, and staffing. If ensuing \nprojects  prepared  under  the  facility  will  be  implemented  by  another  agency,  the  agency  will \nundergo financial management assessment as well as other due diligence during appraisal of the \nensuing loans. \n \n24. \nThe procurement risk of the RHD and Bangladesh Railway is rated moderate, as only the \nconsultant recruitment is to be financed under the facility. Procurement of consulting services will \nbe conducted in line with the ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers.  Disbursement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The advance fund and the statement of expenditure procedures will be applied \nto disbursements for national individual consultants. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith the government, the RHD, and Bangladesh Railway.
