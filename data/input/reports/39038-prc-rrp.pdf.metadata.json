An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken. \nThe summary was uploaded on the website of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 18 February 2006. \n \nThe  Project,  in  the  middle  of  Heilongjiang  province,  is  designed  to \npromote  sustainable  economic  growth  by  improving  the  Jixi\u2013Nehe \nhighway,  a  key  trunk  highway  in  the  northeast.  The  Project  will \ndevelop an integrated road network by upgrading 428 km of the Jixi\u2013\nNehe  provincial  highway  and  its  associated  170  km  of  rural  link \nroads. \n \nCutting across the province\u2019s middle through 11 counties, the 775 km \nJixi\u2013Nehe  corridor  is  a  major  route  connecting  the  eastern  and \nwestern  parts  of  the  northeast  region.  Despite  its  critical  role  in \nnetworking areas, more than a half of the corridor is either class-III or \n-IV  highways,  or  gravel  roads,  all  in  poor  condition.  Some  sections \nhave  no  drainage  system  and  are  impassable  during  winter  or  wet \nseasons. Traffic congestion due to poor road condition often causes \ntransport  costs  to  spiral.  Likewise,  the  expansion  of  economic \nactivities  is  severely  hampered  by  poor  transport  conditions.  The \nProject  will  upgrade  about  half  of  the  Jixi\u2013Nehe  highway.  Forming \npart of the trunk network that is vital to economic development in the \nnortheast,  the  project  highway  will  heighten  transport  efficiency  and \nsafety,  enhance  the  transport  network  in  Heilongjiang,  and  improve \naccess to income-generating opportunities and social services. \n \nThe  Project  is  a  Government  priority  as  it  will  help  revitalize  the \nnortheast region as an industrial hub, a key strategy in the 11th Five-\nYear Plan. The Government also assigns high priority to developing \nlocal roads to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in rural \nareas. The Project will receive ADB\u2019s first loan to upgrade provincial \nhighway  and  improve  rural  link  roads  to  strengthen  the  local  road \nnetwork. The Project will also help diversify ADB\u2019s operations in the \nPRC road sector. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nreduce poverty in Heilongjiang by (i) heightening transport efficiency \nand  safety,  (ii)  enhancing  the  transport  network  by  completing  the \nJixi\u2013Nehe highway and integrating rural roads into the main highway, \nand  (iii)  improving  access  to  income-generating  opportunities  and \nsocial services. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nThe Project will comprise (i) a main highway component\u2014upgrading \nor constructing five sections, totaling 428 km of class-III highways or \nunclassified roads to two-lane class-II or -I highways; (ii) a rural link \nroad  component  to  strengthen  the  integrated  network  in  the  project \narea\u2014improving  22  sections  totaling  170  km;  (iii)  local  road \nmaintenance;  and  (iv)  equipment,  consulting  services,  capacity \ndevelopment, and land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $524.55  million  equivalent,  including \ntaxes and duties of $11.98 million. \n \n\n($ million)\n\nSource \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n38.1 \n28.4 \n19.6 \n13.9 \n100.0 \n\n200.0  \n148.8  \n102.7  \n73.1  \n524.6  \n\nAsian Development Bank \nChina Development Bank \nMinistry of Communications \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government \n \n \nA loan of $200 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and commitment charge of \n0.75%  per  annum  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.  Of  the  ADB  loan,  $15 million  will  finance \nthe rural link road component. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Government, \nwhich will, in turn, make the loan proceeds available to Heilongjiang \nprovincial government, on the same financial terms and conditions as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  government  will  bear  the  interest  rate \nvariation and foreign exchange risks. \n \nUntil 30 September 2011 \n \n30 September 2010 \n\n \nHeilongjiang Provincial Communications Department (HPCD)  \n \nThe  project  implementation  unit  in  HPCD  will  be  the  implementing \nagency. It will coordinate and monitor the construction activities and \noperate  the  Project.  HPCD  will  implement  the  rural  link  road \ncomponent. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. Civil works for the main highway component are divided \ninto 26 packages, all to be procured under international competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Civil  works  for  the  rural  link  roads  are \ndivided  into  14  packages,  all  to  be  procured  under  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  (NCB).  Equipment  contracts  valued \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nloan  will \n\nfinance  7  person-months  of \n\nat  $1  million  or  less  may  follow  ICB,  NCB,  or  limited  international \nbidding as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract \npackages.  Below  $100,000,  equipment  procurement  may  follow  the \nshopping  procedure.  Road  safety  facilities,  greening  work,  and \nancillary  facilities,  including  the  administration  building,  will  be \nprocured using NCB.  The international bidding will be conducted by \na  qualified  tendering  company  with  experience  in  externally  funded \nprojects. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be \nincluded  in  all  documents  and  contracts  related  to  project  bidding \nand  implementation.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works \nand  retroactive  financing  were  requested  by  the  Government  and \napproved  by  ADB.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  the \napproval  of  the  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \nThe  ADB \ninternational \nconsulting  services  for  resettlement,  socioeconomic  and  poverty \nimpact  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  asset  management  and \nmaintenance.  The  international  consultants  will  be  financed  by  the \nADB loan and recruited based on simplified technical proposals and \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. HPCD will engage and finance \nabout  4,900  person-months  of  domestic  consultants,  of  which  300 \nperson-months will be allocated to the rural link road component and \nabout  50  person-months  to  monitoring  the  Project\u2019s  resettlement, \nsocioeconomic, and poverty impacts. \n \nThe  improvement  of  the  Jixi\u2013Nehe  highway  will  promote  economic \ngrowth  in  the  area  and  integrate  poor,  isolated  regions  with  the \ncenters of economic growth. Once linked to the major road network, \nthe  improved  rural  roads  will  facilitate  the  spread  of  the  project \nhighway\u2019s benefits to the rural economy. Improved transportation will \nincrease  income  opportunities  from  cash  crop  farming  or  seasonal \nwork  involving  migration,  increase  contact  with  urban  centers,  and \nease trips to markets and social services.  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  such  as  transport \nproviders, bus and truck operators, passengers, traders, government \nofficials,  and  the  private  sector  in  general.  Rural  households  in  the \nproject  area  will  also  benefit.  Farmers  will  have  better  access  to \nmarkets.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is \nestimated  at  21.0%  and  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nproject  highway  component  at  6.5%,  higher  than  the  2.8%  real \nweighted average cost of capital. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  technical, \neconomic, financial, and social risks. To minimize the technical risk, \ninternational consultants carefully reviewed the proposed design and \nconstruction  methods.  The  prequalification  of  contractors  will  focus \non their financial and technical capabilities in handling similar works. \nDuring  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation  systems  will  be  set  up  and  implemented  for  timely \nidentification of technical problems and implementation of corrective \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nmeasures.  HPCD  has  a  proven  track  record  and  satisfactory \nperformance  in  implementing  internationally  financed  projects.  The \nfinancial  risk  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the \nhighway will depend on the actual level and composition of traffic, the \nconstruction  costs,  the  ability  of  the  commercial  management,  and \nthe  tolls  charged.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  HPCD  will  create  a \ncommercial business environment for highway maintenance, and the \ncentral  and  provincial  governments  will  inject  substantial  equity  into \nthe project roads.

\n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Heilongjiang  Road  Network  Development \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. \nGDP has grown more than 9.0% per year since the 1980s, and the incidence of rural poverty fell \nfrom  33.0%  in  1978  to  just  2.8%  in  2004.  Sustained  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  an \nunprecedented  expansion  of  traffic  between  and  within  provinces.  The  economy\u2019s  changing \nstructure and increasing diversification have altered the pattern of transport demand, which has \noutpaced that for other modes of transport. The movement of goods and passengers by road, \nwhich  is  more  flexible  and  responsive  to  market  needs  than  other  modes  of  transport,  is \nincreasing rapidly. The shift in demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive restrictions \nin the road transport industry. Large investments in automotive manufacturing and the country\u2019s \nrapid  economic  growth  spurred  the  expansion  of  vehicle  fleets  at  a  pace  that  will  likely  be \nmaintained in coming years. \n \n3. \nPropelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  drastic  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments  in  roads.  The  Government  has  made  major  efforts  to  increase  road  capacity  to \nmeet  the  growing  demand  for  improved  access  to  markets  and  services;  it  spent  about \nCNY2,000 billion on building new roads during the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP). As a result, the \nhighway network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.93 million km in 2005, for an average \nannual  increase  of  6%.  Of  these  roads,  1.59  million  km  were  classified.  The  total  length  of \nexpressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to 41,005 km in 2005. Class-I highways increased \nfrom  196  km  in  1980  to  38,381  km  in  2005,  or  29%  per  year  on  average.  Class-II  and  above \nhighways accounted for 328,500 km, or 15.5% of the total length. County, township, and village \nroads, which the Ministry of Communications (MOC) classifies as rural roads, totaled 2.9 million \nkm in 2005 (Appendix 2).  \n \n4.  \nThe Government\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010), \ncalls for (i) the construction of 38,000 km of new roads to expand the total road network to 2.3 \nmillion km, of which, 25,000 km will be expressways, bringing the total length of expressways to \n65,000  km;  (ii)  the  completion  of  the  National  Trunk  Highway  System;  (iii)  the  completion  of \ninterprovincial  western  development  corridors;  and  (iv)  the  completion  of  65\u201370%  of  the \nNational Expressway Network, with the total length reaching 55,000\u201360,000 km. \n \n5. \nEven  though  rural  roads  play  a  huge  role  in  poverty  reduction,  the  rural  road  network, \nwhich accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s total road network of 3.3 million km, is underdeveloped \nin both extent and quality. Thus, the 30 million rural poor face significant challenges in relation \nto  transport.  Many  live  in  isolated  villages,  which  increase  their  transportation  costs,  thereby \nrestricting their access to basic goods and services. Most rural roads, especially in the west, are \nin  poor  condition  because  of  deficient  design  and  construction,  inadequate  maintenance,  and \ndamage caused by overloaded vehicles. The roads\u2019 technical standards are low: only 11% are \nclass-III highways or above. Village roads are even worse, with merely 2% being rated class III \nor above. Only 20% of county roads, 15% of township roads, and 9% of village roads are paved. \nAbout  71%  of  rural  roads  are  dirt  roads  that  serve  many  townships  and  villages.  These  earth \n\n\f 2 \n\ntracks have no drainage system,  making them unsuitable for motorized traffic and impassable \nduring  the  rainy  season,  preventing  the  rural  poor  from  taking  advantage  of  jobs  created  by \neconomic growth. \n \nThe  11th  FYP  assigns  high  priority  to  local  road  development  to  promote  economic \n6. \ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas.  By  2010,  paved  roads  will  link  all  eastern  villages, \n80% of the central villages, and 90% of the western villages. The Government plans to invest \nCNY100 billion more to complete 1.2 million km of rural roads under the 11th FYP. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\n \n7. \nDespite the huge amount of investment, the road network still does not provide access to \nlarge  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  the  poorer  inland  regions,  and  is  inadequate  to  support \nsustainable economic growth. High-standard roads (above class II) account for only 15.5% of the \ntotal network. The remaining 80% are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel roads (para. \n5).  Expanding  demand  for  road  transport  has  strained  road  infrastructure,  as  manifested  by \nbottlenecks in the network. The resulting high cost of shipping goods between inland provinces \nand ports has been a serious constraint. \n \n8. \nHeilongjiang  is  in  northeast  PRC,  bounded  by  the  PRC\u2019s  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous \nRegion on the west, the Russian Federation on the north, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea on the east, and Jilin province on the south. Heilongjiang stands out for its fertile land and \nabundant natural resources. Of its 454,000 km2\u2014it is the sixth largest province\u201442% is forest, \nand  its  cultivated  land  area  (9.7  million  hectares)  is  the  largest  in  the  country.  Heilongjiang\u2019s \npopulation in  2004  was  38.2  million,  of  which  53%  was  urban.  The  province  was  an  industrial \nbase before the 1980s; its main sectors are petroleum, coal, power plant equipment, metallurgy, \nheavy machinery, special-tempered steel, timber, and woodworking. Foreign trade is vital to the \nprovince\u2019s economy; international and domestic demand for its products has consistently risen. \nDespite  its  strategic  importance  and  economic  potential,  however,  Heilongjiang  has  been  left \nbehind  by  the  coastal  provinces  since  the  1980s.  In  1982,  its  per  capita  GDP  was  about  the \nsame  as  that  of  the  coastal  provinces  (Anhui,  Jiangsu,  Shanghai,  and  Zhejiang).  By  2004, \nHeilongjiang\u2019s  GDP  had  dropped  to  merely  58%  of  theirs.  The  province\u2019s  primary,  secondary, \nand tertiary industries contribute 12%, 55%, and 33% of GDP. About half of the total labor force \nis absorbed by the primary industries, mainly agriculture and mining.  \n \n9. \nThe Project will upgrade or construct 428 km of the Jixi-Nehe highway. The 775-km Jixi-\nNehe highway, cutting across the middle of Heilongjiang through 11 counties, is a major route \nconnecting  the  eastern  and  western  parts  of  the  province.  However,  more  than  a  half  of  the \ncorridor  falls  under  class-III  or  -IV  highways,  or  gravel  roads,  which  are  in  poor  condition. \nSections without any drainage system are impassable during winter or the wet season. Traffic \ncongestion  due  to  poor  road  condition  often  causes  transport  costs  to  spiral.  Likewise,  the \nexpansion  of  economic  activities,  including  agricultural  and  industrial  trade,  is  severely \nhampered  by  poor  transport  conditions.  The  project  highway  will  upgrade  three  sections \nurgently needing improvement to two-lane class-I or -II standards and construct two new class-II \nsections1\u2014the missing links in the Jixi-Nehe corridor\u2014to strengthen integrated road networks in \nHeilongjiang, where poverty is high. \n\n                                                 \n1  One class II section is a 2.2 km bridge across the Songhua river to connect the mountainous Tonghe county to the \n\nexpressway network, and the other, a new 22 km road in Tonghe. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nThe project highway will link Jixi city, a coal producer in the east, four forest counties in \n10. \nthe  middle,  and  three  agricultural  counties  in  the  west.  The  project  highway  will  be  connected \nwith  one  expressway,  four  national  highways,  and  six  provincial  highways,  forming  part  of  the \ntrunk network that is vital to Heilongjiang and the northeast. Some sections of the roads that will \ncomprise the Project are clogged, carrying an average of 2,440 vehicles daily. Traffic in some \nsections has been growing at more than 12% annually in the past years. Overall, traffic on the \nproject roads will start growing at 8\u20139% yearly by 2014. The Project is expected to increase the \nnetwork\u2019s  transport  capacity  and  efficiency,  catalyzing  economic  growth,  spurring  interregional \ntrade, and reducing poverty. \n \n11. \nThe  project  area  has  limited  accessibility;  its  six  counties  and  two  cities,  including  two \npoverty-designated  counties,  are  mostly  rural\u201467%  of  3.4  million  people.  In  2004,  the  per \ncapita rural income was CNY2,617, and the per capita GDP was CNY5,651, less than half the \nprovincial average of CNY13,897. The per capita urban income was CNY4,380. Above 18% of \nthe rural population is defined as poor, with annual per capita incomes below CNY900. Of the \n1,023  villages  in  the  project  area,  393  are  poor.  Rural  people  pay  high  rates  for  motorized \ntransport,  have  insufficient  access  to  markets,  and  have  little  mobility  beyond  their  immediate \ncommunities.  The  main  causes  of  poverty  include  (i)  limited  road  access  to  markets  for  farm \nproducts,  (ii)  the  decline  in  the  timber  industry  because  of  restrictions  on  tree  cutting,  (iii) \ninadequate  road  transport  services,  (iv)  lack  of  skills  and  insufficient  credit,  and  (v)  natural \ndisasters.  \n \n12. \nAbout 90% of the villages in the project area do not have adequate access to all-weather \nroads.  Poor  roads  have  resulted  in  inadequate  and  unaffordable  transport  services,  with \nlicensed bus and truck operators deterred from plying the routes to townships and villages. As a \nresult, many villages and townships have no direct bus service. Fares and routes of the formal \nbus system are regulated, often resulting in inefficient service. Villagers have to rely on informal \nmeans  of  transport  such  as  bicycles,  horse-drawn  wagons,  and  motorized  tricycles.  Because \nthese are confined to services between villages and townships, they cannot replace the formal \ntransport  system.  As  a  result,  the  poor,  who  often  have  to  walk  to  nearby  rotating  village \nmarkets, can sell only the produce that they can carry on their backs. A second option is selling \nto drive-in traders who thus have stronger bargaining power. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n \n13. \nIn  November  2003,  the  Government  embarked  on  a  grand  plan  to  revitalize  the \nnortheast region\u2014including Heilongjiang\u2014as an industrial hub, thereby attaining and sustaining \neconomic  growth  of  over  10%.  MOC  drafted  the  northeast  regional  transport  network \ndevelopment plan in September 2004. The plan aims to construct an integrated road\u2013waterway \nnetwork in the region to catalyze economic development. In line with the plan, the Heilongjiang \nProvincial Communications Department (HPCD) launched the province\u2019s plan for 2005\u201320172 to  \nextend the improved trunk network to major ports to facilitate international and regional trade.3 \nThe improvement of the Jixi-Nehe highway is a priority project included in the plan. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  HPCD prepared the 30-year investment program in 1998 under ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Provincial Highway Network Planning. Manila. The TA\u2019s outcome provided the basis of the \nprovincial implementation plan for 2005\u20132017. \n\n3  The  key  components  are  three  radiate,  four  east\u2013west,  and  six  south\u2013north  highways,  totaling  6,162  km.  By  the \ntime the network is completed in 2017, Heilongjiang will have 17,170 km of high-class highways. When the network \nis completed, an economic circle will be formed, centered at Harbin, the provincial capital. Eleven of the 13 cities or \ndistricts will be within 5 hours\u2019 drive from Harbin.  \n\n\f 4 \n\nThe  11th  FYP  assigns  high  priority  to  local  road  development  to  promote  economic \n14. \ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  road  sector \nassistance will  be  broadened  to  finance  non-expressways.  The  Project  will  receive  ADB\u2019s  first \nloan  to  upgrade  provincial  highway  and  improve  rural  link  roads  to  strengthen  the  local  road \nnetwork. The Project will also help diversify ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC road sector. \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector  supports  (i)  the  construction  of \nroads that connect growth centers with hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the network \nso that the national trunk highway system is supported by the local road networks, particularly \nthose  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii)  the  delivery  of  adequate  and  affordable  transport \nservices;  (iv)  the  promotion  of  road  safety  and  the  reduction  of  vehicle  emissions;  (v)  the \nstrengthening  of  institutions  to  increase  financial  and  managerial  efficiency  in  expressway \noperation; (vi) the adoption of pricing policies to optimize road transport capacity; and (vii) the \nuse  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector  participation.  The \nProject is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n16. \nThe Project will help revitalize the northeast region by completing the upgrading of the \nJixi-Nehe  highway,  a  key  project  included  in  the  northeast  regional  transport  network \ndevelopment  plan.  By  lowering  transport  costs  and  improving  the  frequency  and  level  of \ntransport  services,  the  Project  is  expected  to  spur  economic  activity  and  interregional  trade, \nthereby reducing poverty. The development of the road network will help transfer the benefits of \nthe  coastal  and  eastern  region\u2019s  economic  growth  to  the  poor  inland  region.  A  rural  link  road \ncomponent has been integrated into the Project to improve the road network in the rural area. \nThis integrated approach will ensure that the Project benefits the poor and lower-income groups. \n \n17. \nEvaluations  of  several  completed  road  projects  financed  by  ADB  have  confirmed  that \nroad  investments  reduce  poverty.4 Several  ADB  studies  have  also  affirmed  the  relevance  of \nADB\u2019s strategy, showing that road infrastructure has helped reduce poverty in the PRC not only \nby directly improving the lives of the poor but also by diversifying their sources of income and \nhelping  increase  their  productivity.  The  findings  of  an  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  (TA)5 \nconfirmed  that  the  road  portfolio\u2019s  geographic  focus\u2014the  poorer  western  interior  provinces\u2014\nwas valid. The TA showed that complementary investments in local roads strengthen the impact \nof expressway investments. ADB has rigorously tried to identify road projects that focus sharply \non poverty reduction. \n \n18. \nExternal assistance has helped the Government streamline its road sector strategy and \ninvestment projects, mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and \nthe World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 32 loans totaling $6.4 billion to finance 4,455 \nkm of expressways and 8,366 km of associated local road networks. Since 1995, projects have \nincluded local roads to make ADB\u2019s interventions more pro-poor. Of the ADB-funded projects, \n18  have  already  been  completed  and  are  open  to  traffic.  ADB  has  also  supplied  54  TA \npackages totaling $28.3 million to the road sector. The advisory TA has addressed policy and \ninstitutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resources  development, \nsocioeconomic  assessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2000.

The  World  Bank  has  provided  $6.6  billion  and  JBIC  \u00a5219  billion  to  finance  road \ninvestments. ADB coordinates with these organizations to ensure that each major development \npartner focuses on different corridors, and information related to policy advice is shared across \nthe development community (Appendix 3). \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nHPCD  has  prepared  and  implemented  two  ADB-financed  road  projects  well. 6  The \n19. \nsafeguard policies on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people7 have been \nimplemented.  Lessons  learned  from  projects  include  (i)  the  advantages  of  a  participatory \napproach  to  project  preparation;  (ii)  the  benefits  of  a  well-coordinated  resettlement  schedule, \npreceded by consultations with the affected parties before their relocation; and (iii) the need for \ncareful geological investigation during the design stage to minimize contract variations. All these \nissues were taken into account during project preparation. Consultations with affected villagers \nwere emphasized from the start, and geological investigations carefully reviewed. \n \nPerformance  reviews  of  completed  ADB-financed  road  projects  elsewhere  in  the  PRC \n20. \nindicate  that,  in  general,  the  projects  facilitated  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  as \nenvisaged during project preparation. Completed projects show that (i) ADB\u2019s safeguard policies \nwere met; (ii) loan covenants were generally complied with; (iii) people\u2019s living standards were \nimproved  through  better  access  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social  services;  (iv)  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of ADB-financed roads were generally satisfactory; and (v) recent projects \nhelped  raised  policy  makers\u2019  awareness  of  the  importance  of  addressing  key  issues  of  road \nsafety  and  vehicle  emissions.  The  performance  audit  reports  for  four  road  projects  concluded \nthat they were either highly successful or successful. The lessons gleaned from ADB-financed \nroad  projects  are  reflected  in  the  design  of  the  Project.  To  avoid  delayed  loan  effectiveness \ncaused  by  late  procurement,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  civil  works \ncontractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and \nincluding  anticorruption \nprovisions,  were  discussed  extensively  during  appraisal.  Emphasis  was  put  on  the  need  to  (i) \nstrictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clearly substantiate the conclusions of the bid evaluation. \n \n\nrequirements, \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n21. \nTransport  Services  in  the  Project  Area. The rural poor benefit from a road project in \ndirect  proportion  to  their  access  to  reliable  and  affordable  transport  services,  which  are, \ntherefore,  essential  to  strengthen  the  poverty  impacts  of  road  infrastructure.  During  project \npreparation, attention was given to the delivery of efficient, affordable, and sustainable transport \nservices.  The  project  area  comprises  6  counties  and  2  cities,  with  103  townships  and  1,023 \nvillages.  It  has  only  2  class-I  bus  terminals,  and  5  class-II  and  14  class-III  bus  stations.  Many \nvillages and townships have no direct access to bus service; more than 85% of the villages do \nnot  have  even  class-V  rural  bus stops.  Expanding  access  to  transport is  a  key  strategy  in  the \n11th FYP. A class-III bus terminal in Fangzheng will be upgraded to class II, and 90 class-III bus \nstations and 160 bus stops will be constructed. By 2010, each township in the project area will \nhave one class-III bus station and 30% of the villages will have bus stops. HPCD will see to the \n\n                                                 \n6  They include the Jianmusi\u2013Harbin section of the Tongsan Expressway Project (approved in 1994) and the Harbin\u2013\n\nShuangcheng section of the Tongsan Expressway (approved in 1998). \n\n7  ADB. 2002.

To  maximize  the  project  benefits,  attention  has  been \ngiven to spur small businesses and commercial activities. The TA survey8 shows that less than \n10%  of  the  people  run  small  businesses,  mainly  transportation,  groceries,  food  and  grain \nprocessing,  trading  of  agricultural  products,  and  eateries.  Inadequate  road  infrastructure  has \ngreatly hampered small businesses. The lack of skills, insufficient starter funds, limited access \nto  marketing  information,  and  inexperience  also  hinder  local  commerce.  During  the  11th  FYP, \nthe  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  (HPG)  and  local  governments  will  pay  particular \nattention  to  the  establishment  of  a  wide  assortment  of  small  businesses  and  commercial \nactivities, which will provide communities with basic needs and jobs. The strategy is focused on \n(i)  developing  community-based  enterprises  such  as  agroprocessing,  herbal  and  homeopathic \nmedicines,  timber  products,  distribution  and  transport  systems,  hotels,  and  restaurants;  (ii) \nconstructing roadside stations as focal points for small business development; and (iii) creating \nan  economic  zone  in  each  county,  specifically  targeting  small  businesses,  which  requires \ngovernment intervention to, for example, locate and group similar types of businesses. \n \n23. \nThe  local  governments  will  help  communities  set  up  small  enterprises.  In  collaboration \nwith HPG, the eight county governments in the project area have prepared a plan to spur small \nenterprises. During the 11th FYP, CNY64 million will be pumped into 18 new factories; 56% of \nthe funds will come from the private sector. A township-owned paddy trading company will be \nestablished  in  Tieli  county,  and  a  village-owned  refinery  factory  in  Hailun  county.  The  county \ngovernments will (i) allocate CNY8 million for a special-purpose loan that will help residents set \nup  small  businesses;  (ii)  provide  entrepreneurial  training  to  poor  local  residents;  and  (iii) \ncoordinate with cooperatives in providing small enterprises with assistance, such as information \ndistribution. Each county also plans to construct one roadside station along the project highway, \ncosting a total of CNY34 million. The construction of eight roadside stations and the birth of new \nenterprises will accelerate community development (Appendix 5). \n \n24. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation. In the transport sector, the private sector\u2019s first activities \nare  typically  in  highway  construction,  design,  supervision,  and  periodic  maintenance,  through \ncooperative joint venture, securitization, and revenue-bond-financing and build-operate-transfer \ncontracts. The private sector also actively participates in contracted-out maintenance. However, \ntoll operation and private financing are difficult for the private sector to get into since it is difficult \nto  reliably  estimate  traffic  and  toll  revenues.  In  Heilongjiang,  two  sections  were  implemented \nusing  build-operate-transfer:  the  42-km  Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou  class-II  highway  and  the  49-km \nHulan\u2013Lanxi  class-I  highway.  The  30-year  O&M  concession  was  awarded  to  a  private \ncompany.9 Profits amount to about 83\u201384% of toll revenues. Roads are maintained according to \nthe agreed standards, and maintenance is monitored annually by the provincial government. For \nthe  project  highway,  HPCD  will  do  its  best  to  enter  into  an  O&M  concession  for  class-I  roads \n(totaling 8 km), and pursue awarding a maintenance concession for the rest of the class-II roads \n(paras. 32\u201333). \n \nRoad Safety. In 2004, 41 deaths occurred per 10,000 vehicles\u2014high by international \n25. \nstandards. The Ministry of Public Security is committed to reducing accidents through improved \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Heilongjiang Road Network \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n9  The Guanyang Group, a private company, developed the 42 km Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou class-II section for CNY345 \nmillion.  It  also  developed  the  49  km  Hulan\u2013Lanxi  class-I  section  for  CNY700  million.  The  Zhaodong\u2013Zhaozhou \nsection generates toll revenue of CNY16 million a year and the Hulan\u2013Lanxi section, CNY31 million. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nvehicular safety, driver training, and traffic management. The Road Traffic Safety Law went into \neffect in May 2004. HPCD and the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau are working together to \nfulfill the requirements of the new law and enhance road safety. A committee was established to \ndevelop  and  enforce  nationwide  regulations  on  overloaded  trucks,  including  putting  axle  load \nlimits  on  roads.  Road  safety  concerns  associated  with  harsh  winter  weather  have  been \naddressed:  HPCD  has  designed  the  project  highway  using  several  ice  and  snow  control \nmeasures  according  to  their  design  standards.  Mixed  traffic  of  high-  and  low-speed  vehicles \nalong  the  project  highway  adds  a  safety  concern:  in  consultation  with  local  governments, \nshoulders of many sections of the project highway were widened while the detailed design was \nprepared to ensure the safety of low-speed farm vehicles and pedestrians.  \n \n26. \nAt  least  6  months  before  the  highway  opens,  HPCD  will  (i)  implement  a  road  safety \naction plan for the highway; and (ii) ensure, in collaboration with the Heilongjiang Public Security \nBureau, that a team of bureau personnel will patrol the highway and enforce the new law and \nregulations.  Some  20  person-months  of  consulting  services  from  a  domestic  road  safety \nspecialist will be engaged to help HPCD develop the road safety action plan and check designs \nand  safety  aspects  of  the  project  roads.  A  rural  road  safety  zone  in  Qing\u2019an  (2.5  km)  will  be \ncreated to ensure rural road safety along the project roads. In the zone, the local government \nwill follow the best practices to ensure rural road safety. The accident rate and traffic volume will \nbe monitored after the highway starts to operate, to verify the efficacy of the piloted safety zone \n(Appendix 6). \n \n27. \nVehicle  Emissions.  The  increasing  number  of  vehicles  has  raised  concerns  about \nvehicle  emissions  and  air  pollution.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to  control \nemissions:  regulating  the  automobile  industry,  requiring  an  annual  vehicle  test,  and  drafting  a \nvehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  set  emission  and  fuel \nefficiency  targets  and  offer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  environmentally  friendly  cars. \nHeilongjiang  has  vehicle  emission  standards,  and  the  Heilongjiang  Environmental  Protection \nBureau  (HEPB)  regularly  tests  all  types  of  vehicles.  The  Project  will  lessen  air  pollution,  as \nvehicle emissions on the project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows. \nUpon completion of the Project, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicles on the project roads are \nestimated to be 30% lower than before the Project. Carbon dioxide emissions will be 30% lower. \nAt least 6 months before the highway opens, HPCD will provide ADB with (i) the regulations for \nvehicle  emission  limits  and  the  penalties  for  violating  emission  standards;  and  (ii)  the  latest \ngovernment  plan,  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  new  standards  for  vehicle  emissions,  to \nimprove  air  quality  in  Heilongjiang,  including  cleaner  fuel  programs.  With  the  assistance  of \nconsulting  services,  HPCD  and  HEPB  will  develop  and  implement  an  action  plan  to  control \nvehicle emissions (Appendix 6). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  will  help  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in \nHeilongjiang  by  (i)  heightening  transport  efficiency  and  safety,  (ii)  enhancing  the  transport \nnetwork  by  improving  the  Jixi-Nehe  highway  and  integrating  rural  link  roads  into  the  main \nhighway, and (iii) improving the access to income-generating opportunities and social services. \n \n \n \n\n\f 8 \n\nOutputs \n\nSpecial Features \n\nB. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  (i)  the  upgrading  of  428  km  of  the  Jixi-Nehe  highway,  from \nclass III or unclassified to class II or I; (ii) the improvement of rural link roads, totaling 170 km, to \nstrengthen  the  integrated  network  in  the  project  area;  (iii)  rural  road  maintenance;  and  (iv) \nequipment, consulting services, capacity development, and land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nC. \n \n30. \nRural  Link  Road  Component  To  strengthen  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  road \ninvestment,  the  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  focused  on  the  need  to \nintegrate  rural  road  improvement  into  the  project  design.  To  expand  the  road  network  in  rural \nvillages, the Project includes the improvement  of rural link roads. The 22 sections of rural link \nroads, totaling 170 km, have been selected to link poor villages to the county center through the \nproject  highway,  thus  favoring  the  poor  in  the  benefit  distribution.  The  sections  are  currently \nunclassified and will be upgraded to class IV under the Project. Of the $200 million ADB loan, \n$15  million  is  earmarked  to  finance  the  rural  link  road  component  (Appendix  7).  Some  1.7 \nmillion  people  will  benefit  from  the  Project,  of  which  379,500  people  in  poor  rural  villages  will \nbenefit from improved rural link roads. The rural link roads will (i) be upgraded concurrently with \nthe  project  highway,  (ii)  use  Government  design  standards  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  (iii) \nfollow ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies, and (iv) be monitored for impact to the same degree as \nthe project highway. Some 300 person-months of domestic consultants will be allocated to this \ncomponent  to  ensure  proper  design  and  supervision,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nengineering staff training, and project management. \n \n31. \nRural Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof  rural  roads,  a  job  for  which  local  administrative  units  are  responsible.  During  the  TA,  the \nfollowing  were  examined:  (i)  planning  of  and  standards  for  maintenance,  (ii)  funding  sources, \nand  (iii)  monitoring  of  maintenance.  Maintenance  planning  often  hinges  on  subjective \nassessments,  mainly  because  the  local  government  lacks  the  resources  to  maintain  its  road \nnetworks. Local authorities draft plans for routine maintenance work, but periodic maintenance \nis  budget-driven  and  lacks  a  systematic,  preventive  approach.  The  quality  of  rural  roads  does \nnot seem to be systematically monitored by the higher authorities. Considering the limited funds \nfor  maintenance,  a  simple  method  for  evaluating  and  prioritizing  maintenance  works  must  be \nestablished  to  streamline  work  programming  and  ensure  effective  fund  use.  During  project \nimplementation, the HPCD will develop a sound road maintenance management system, which \nwill  (i)  set  up  measures  to  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii)  include  a  modern  method  of \nevaluation  and  maintenance  prioritization  for  efficient  work  programming  and  fund  use;  (iii) \ninclude  a  compilation  of  road  inventories  and  basic  condition  data;  and  (iv)  have  a  monitoring \nsystem to be used by the residents. One person-month of international consulting services and \n3  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  engaged.  Based  on  the  output  of  an \nADB  TA, 10  in  addition,  the  HPCD  will  develop  a  province-specific  rural  road  maintenance \nmanual  by  2007,  with  the  assistance  of  15  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  A \ntraining program will be provided to strengthen the capacity of local governments (Appendix 8). \n \n32. \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Concession. O&M improves substantially when handled \nby  the  private  sector.  An  O&M  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a  government  or  a  state \nenterprise and a private enterprise, whereby the private enterprise maintains the road according \nto agreed standards and collects tolls from users that finance the maintenance and reward the \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Rural Road Development Strategy. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nconcessionaire.  Under  an  O&M  contract,  the  concessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  risk  and, \nultimately,  the  revenue  risk.  Heilongjiang  has  so  far  attempted  to  offer  O&M  concessions  for \nthree  expressways:  Jiamusi\u2013Harbin,  Shangzhsi\u2013Harbin,  and  Daqing\u2013Harbin.  However,  none \nwas successful, mainly because of the traffic and revenue risks. Private investors thought that \ntraffic  forecasts  were  overly  optimistic  and  proposed  toll  rates  that  were  relatively  high \ncompared  with  the  economic  level.  The  current  toll-setting  process  does  not  reflect  demand \nmanagement.11 These  factors  often  discourage  all  but  a  few  private  investors  from  bidding. \nHPCD  will  allocate  $200,000  of  the  ADB  loan  for  a  study  on  how  to  strengthen  domestic \ncapacity  to  tackle  the  problem  and  how  to  facilitate  awarding  O&M  concessions  to the  private \nsector. \n \n33. \nUpon  project  completion,  HPCD  will  do  its  best  to  award  an  O&M  concession  for  the \nclass-I section (totaling 8 km) and a maintenance concession for the rest (class-II roads).12 The \n8-km section is strategically located in the corridor. Comprising a 2.63-km bridge and a 5.37-km \nclass-I highway, the section is a major river crossing, with few nearby practical alternatives. Its \nphysical  characteristics  make  the  section  attractive.  The  efficiency  gain  from  an  O&M \nconcession  to  the  private  sector  for  the  8-km  section  will  boost  the  other  sections\u2019  efficiency. \nHPCD  and  ADB  will  make  sure  that  (i)  the  concession  is  adequately  priced  by  awarding  it \nthrough competitive bidding; (ii) bidding for the concession is transparent to maximize the gain \nof the concession to the efficiency in the operation; and (iii) the maintenance of the project roads \nwill  meet  the  agreed  standards.  HPCD  will  submit  the  bidding  documents  and  the  concession \nframework to ADB for review by 2008. \n \n34. \nStakeholder Consultations. During the preparation of the feasibility study, environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  and  resettlement  planning  consultations  were  conducted  with \ngovernment agencies, villagers, local groups, and other people likely to be affected by the Project, \nto discuss environmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement, and economic development \npotential.  Village  investigations  and  surveys  were  conducted  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  potential \nadverse effects and benefits. Over 2,400 people were interviewed during public opinion surveys, \nsocial  and  environmental  assessments,  and  resettlement  planning.  For  the  resettlement  plan, \nconsultation meetings were held with representatives of affected counties, townships, and villages. \nRural  people  were  familiar  with  the  Project  and  public  support  for  it  was  high.  Local  officials \nexplained  the  compensation  policies  and  regulations  to  those  who  would  lose  their  farmland  or \nhousing.  The  consultation  was  expanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  compensation \nstandards  and  rehabilitation  measures  for  people  displaced  by  land  acquisition  or  house \ndemolition. Villagers participated in the discussions and decisions on resettlement (Appendix 9). \n \nD. \n \n35. \n$11.98 million (Appendix 10). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  project  investment  is  estimated  at  $524.55  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n                                                 \n11 Even under a concession arrangement, toll setting requires approval of the price bureau. \n12 Under PRC law, the provincial government retains the operating rights to roads that are ranked as class II or lower. \n\nThus, only a maintenance concession will be awarded to the private sector for the rest of the highway. \n\n\f 10 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Of the ADB \nloan,  $15 million  will  finance  the  rural  link  road  component,  with  the  remaining  costs  to  be \ncovered by the fund to be raised by provincial and county governments. HPCD has committed \nto ensuring the implementation of these roads during the project period. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n37.  MOC  and HPG will provide 33.5% of the project costs on a grant basis. The MOC grant \nwill amount to $102.7 million and the HPG grant to $73.1 million. The China Development Bank \nwill provide a $148.8 million loan on a 20-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, at an \ninterest rate of 6.12%. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to the Government, which \nwill,  in  turn,  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  HPG,  on  the  same  financial  terms  and \nconditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.

The \n38. \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  HPCD  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  highway\u2019s \nconstruction activities and operate the highway. Its general manager, the project director, will be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  management  in  relation  to  the  highway,  approval  of  contracts, \nand  payments.  HPCD  will  implement  the  rural  link  road  component.  PIU  will  facilitate  land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection  measures,  and  ensure  that  local \nconcerns are addressed adequately. PIU will be headed by a project manager, who will oversee \nday-to-day physical implementation activities and prepare progress reports. Besides its central \noffice,  PIU  will  have  nine  toll  stations  and  eight  maintenance  centers.  HPCD  has  sufficient \ntechnical  capability  to  implement  the  Project,  but  its  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be \nstrengthened  in  some  areas  such  as  asset  management  and  maintenance,  monitoring  of \nresettlement,  and  socioeconomic  and  poverty  impact.

The Project will be \nimplemented  over  about  4  years,  from  September  2006.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 11. \n \n \n \n40. \nAll ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works for \nthe  main  highway  component  are  divided  into  26  packages,  all  to  be  procured  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Civil  works  for  the  rural  link  roads  are  divided  into  14 \npackages,  all  to  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Equipment  contracts \nvalued at $1 million or less may follow ICB, NCB, or limited international bidding as determined \nby the particular circumstances of the contract packages. If below $100,000, equipment may be \nprocured  under  the  shopping  procedure.  Road  safety  facilities,  greening  work,  and  ancillary \nfacilities,  including  the  administration  building,  will  be  procured  using  NCB.  Procurement \npackages  are  provided  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  12).

Because project preparation was \nadvanced, ADB approved HPCD\u2019s request for advance procurement action for civil works and \nretroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  $20  million  (equivalent  to  10%  of  the  ADB \nloan)  incurred  in  relation  to  civil  works  from  10  May  2006  up  to  the  loan  effectiveness,  or  a \nmaximum  of  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan,  whichever  was  later.  The  Government \nhas been advised that ADB approval of advance procurement action and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. Contracts proposed for retroactive financing will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n \n \n42. \nThe Project will finance 7 person-months of international consulting services: 6 person-\nmonths for resettlement, socioeconomic, and poverty impact monitoring and evaluation; and 1 \nperson-month for asset management and maintenance. HPCD will engage and finance around \n4,900 person-months of national consultants, 300 person-months of which to be allocated to the \nrural link road component and about 50 person-months to monitoring the Project\u2019s resettlement, \nsocioeconomic, and poverty impacts. The international consultants will be financed by the ADB \nloan  and  recruited  based  on  simplified  technical  proposals  and  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  national \nconsultants  will  be  financed  from  domestic  resources  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  HPCD  will  establish  seven  resident  supervision \nengineer  offices  for  construction  supervision,  environmental  and  resettlement  monitoring,  and \nproject performance monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.13 \n43. \nBecause  most  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  (above  $100,000  equivalent), \ndirect  payments,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  loan \nfunds. To facilitate disbursement for small expenditures, HPG will establish an imprest account \nat  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by \nappropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services are produced in and procured \nfrom ADB members, and eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited into the \nimprest  account  will  not  exceed  $3,000,000.  If  government  funds  are  used  for  eligible \nexpenditures, ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure will be followed.

To ensure that internal controls and checks on the \nproject construction costs and operations are effective, HPCD will establish an internal audit unit \nand will maintain it during project implementation and operation. The unit will independently test \nday-to-day  transactions  before  referring  them  to  external  auditors.  The  project  accounts  and \nannual financial statements will be subject to annual external audit, which will be carried out in \naccordance  with  the  State  Council-approved  regulations  for  auditing  (1993)  and  meet  ADB \nrequirements. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan \nproceeds  and  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants  included  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements. HPCD will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year the \nProject\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, audited project accounts, audit reports, and \nmanagement letters in English. HPCD will submit quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, HPCD will submit a project completion report to ADB, providing details about \nimplementation,  actual  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  cost  estimates,  benefits,  and  other \ninformation that ADB may request. \n \n \n \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy 14 was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government, \n45. \nHPG,  and  HPCD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  Provisions  of  the \nanticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the project bidding documents. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  HPCD  will  (i) \nestablish  a  supervisory  body  to  prevent  interference  in  business  practices,  with  adequate \nresources made available for its effective operation; (ii) involve a leading group of officials from \nHPCD\u2019s  Supervision  Division  in  project  bidding,  construction,  and  other  operational  activities; \n(iii) hold regular briefings between HPCD and the Prosecutor's Office to share information on or \nwarnings about any corrupt practices detected; (iv) periodically inspect contractors\u2019 activities in \nrelation to fund withdrawals and settlements ; and (v) introduce a dual signing system whereby \nthe civil works contract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n \n \n46. \nTo  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance  to  stakeholders,  ADB  uses  the  project  performance  management  system.  The \nmonitoring  will  focus  on  a  few  key  representative  communities.  A  basic  monitoring  framework \nwas  constructed  for  the  Project  to  permit  a  more  definitive  assessment  of  the  actual  benefits. \nHPCD has concurred with (i) the monitoring framework, (ii) the set of indicators to be used for \nmonitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s impacts, and (iii) the selection of the eight representative \nvillages  in  the  project  area.  The  indicators  were  selected  based  on  the  findings  of  an  ADB-\nfinanced  TA  (footnote  5).  The  baseline  values  for  the  indicators  were  established,  where \navailable, during project preparation, and will be updated at project inception. The indicators will \nbe measured at project completion and biennially for 6 years after completion. The poverty and \nsocioeconomic impact monitoring tasks will require 6 person-months of international expertise to \ndefine the monitoring framework and to train domestic consultants in monitoring methodology; \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998.

The \nproject  highway  and  rural  link  roads  will  be  given  the  same  degree  of  attention  as  regards \nimpact  monitoring.  HPCD  and  local  governments  have  assured  ADB  that  monitoring  in  the \nselected communities will be adequately carried out (Appendix 13). \n \n \n \nIn  2008,  ADB  and  HPCD  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  focusing  on \n47. \npolicy,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  economic, \nfinancial,  and  other  factors  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and \ncontinuing  viability.  The  review  will  examine  progress  in  resettlement  and  compliance  with \nassurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nProject Review \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n48. \nBased on the origin-destination and traffic count surveys, the 428-km provincial highway \nwas divided into five sections for the traffic forecast. The associated rural link roads, totaling 170 \nkm, were assigned to the corresponding highway sections to form five separate networks. The \naverage  distance  between  two  points  along  the  highway  was  a  major  factor  in  the  sectional \ndivision. The location of the alignment as regards altitude and existing road conditions was also \nconsidered.  Normal,  diverted,  and  generated  traffic  were  then  forecast  for  each  network.  The \nforecast  average  annual  daily  traffic  on  the  project  highway  is  1,752\u20133,939  vehicles  in  2010, \nwhen  the  Project  begins  operation;  3,920\u20137,636  in  2020;  and  7,549\u201312,979  in  2029.  The \nprojections consider (i) the growth in traffic during the past 10 years, (ii) the traffic generated by \nexpanded  economic  activities,  (iii)  the  likelihood  that  existing  traffic  will  be  diverted  to  the \nhighway once it is operational, and (iv) the traffic survey (Appendix 14). \n \nB. \n \nThe economic evaluation was carried out using highway design and maintenance. The \n49. \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project highway was estimated by comparing the \nproject case for 20 years after improvement, with a base case involving the continued use and \nmaintenance  of  the  existing  road.  Without  the  Project,  congestion  would  increase,  resulting  in \ndelays, higher vehicle operating cost (VOC), and more accidents. The Project, with its reduced \ntravel  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and  better  road  conditions,  will  reduce  VOC  and \naccident risks. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices, expressed in yuan and \nemploying the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign \nexchange  effects.  A  shadow  price  was  used  to  put  an  economic  value  on  the  wages  paid  to \nunskilled  labor,  but  not  on  the  wages  paid  to  skilled  labor,  because  no  skilled  worker  surplus \nexists.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67  was  used  to  convert  the  financial  wage  rate  to  an \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  capital,  including  physical \ncontingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation; and (ii) highway \nO&M,  including  replacing  depreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs \nwere  based  on  their  opportunity  costs:  the  agricultural  output  forgone  and  the  re-siting  of \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\ndisplaced  activities. 15 The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOC  resulting  from  the \nreduced travel distance and improved roads, (ii) savings in passengers\u2019 time and time of freight \ntied up in transit, and (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents. \n \nAn  EIRR  was  calculated  for  each network.  The  EIRR  for  the  five  road  sections swings \n50. \nfrom 15% to 26%, with a consolidated EIRR of 21%. The net present value (NPV) calculated for \neach project section ranges from CNY363 million to CNY1.4 billion. The consolidated NPV for \nthe five road sections amounts to CNY4.6 billion. The results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, \nbenefits,  and  a  1-year  delay  in  project  completion\u2014do  not  significantly  affect  its  economic \nviability (Appendix 15). \n \nC. \n \n51. \nHeilongjiang  is  applying  unified  toll  rates  to  all  class-II  highways  according  to  the \nprovincial government\u2019s policy, which are about 30% lower than the rate for expressways. The \nassumed toll rates for the main highway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient traffic to \nmeet the criteria for the financial rate of return (FIRR).16 HPCD will consult ADB on a proposed \ninitial toll rate scheme 6 months before the highway opens. The scheme will be evaluated based \non (i) the toll levels on similar highways in the province, (ii) affordability, (iii) historical and actual \ntraffic flows, (iv) advantages to the users of the highway, and (v) debt service ability. HPCD will \nreview  the  toll  annually  and  monitor  actual  traffic  levels  and  financial  performance.  Financial \nprojections  prepared  for  the  highway  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB 17  assessed  the \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  (Appendix  16).  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate \nthat financial revenues will be sufficient to absorb O&M costs, income taxes, and debt service. \nThe financial evaluation of the highway used constant 2005 prices. The Project\u2019s cost estimates \nand  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the \nprojected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  The  FIRR  for  the \nproject highway is estimated at about 6.5% after taxes, higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.8%, also net of taxes. The highway is considered to be both financially viable and \nsustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions \n(Appendix 17). \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  area  covers  six  counties,  of  which  two  are  poor  by  national  and  provincial \n52. \nstandards, and two cities. It had 3.4 million people as of 2004, of whom 2.3 million lived in rural \nareas. The project highway passes through 1,023 administrative villages, of which 393 (38.4%) \nare  poor.  Of  the  rural  population,  391,600  (17.0%)  earn  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  less \nthan CNY1,300. Of the urban population of 1.1 million, 92,700 (8.4%) are poor. Once linked to \nthe major road network, the improved rural link roads will spread the benefits to the townships \nand  villages,  including  more  income  opportunities  from  cash  crop  farming  or  seasonal  work \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n                                                 \n15 The  economic  opportunity  costs  of  land  were  assumed  to  be  equivalent  to  the  replacement  value  of  farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation. No additional opportunity cost for land was assumed, because all the \nland is in rural areas. \n\n16 In Heilongjiang, the toll is set at levels that allow the recovery not only of the O&M cost but also the cost of capital. \nFor the class-II Harbin\u2013Jiamusi highway, funded by ADB, tolls for passenger, medium-sized, and large trucks were \nCNY0.37, CNY0.53, and CNY0.72. Some 88\u201390% of toll revenues were used to repay loans, the rest for O&M.  \n17 ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \n\nManila. \n\n\f 16 \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nrequiring  migration,  more  contact  with  urban  centers,  and  improved  access  to  markets  and \nsocial services (Appendix 18). HPCD prepared a social development action plan in collaboration \nwith the local governments. This plan includes measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts \nand to enhance the Project\u2019s benefits to the poor, women, and ethnic minorities (Appendix 19). \n \n53. \nAbout  22,781  people  in  the  project  area  (0.7%  of  the  total  population)  are  ethnic \nminorities,  mainly  Chaoxian  and  Manchu.  The  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  are \ninsignificant (para. 55). The Chaoxian are generally better off than the Han, and the Manchu live \nin scattered settlements. The TA concluded that the minorities will benefit from the Project in a \nmanner that is compatible with their cultural traditions. Minorities belonging to vulnerable groups \nwill get special assistance in economic rehabilitation, and priority for career training. All affected \nminorities will be relocated in the original villages. The Project will give women greater access to \ninformation  and  jobs.  Female  migrant  workers  in  search  of  work  will  find  it  easier  to  travel  to \nurban  centers.  Women  will  benefit  from  increased  marketing  opportunities  and  from  better \naccess to higher-quality education and health facilities. Women will be encouraged to participate \nin project implementation and monitoring and in resettlement and social development. Women \nare  entitled  to  equal  opportunity  and  pay  in  jobs  under  the  PRC  Labor  Law  and  will  receive \npreferential treatment in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development.18 \n \nE. \n \n54. \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on  the  preliminary  design,  village  surveys, \nhousehold surveys, local government statistics, and consultations with local officials and project-\naffected  people.  The  Project  will  affect  6  counties,  2  cities,  36  townships,  130  administrative \nvillages, 6 forest bureaus, and 24 forest stations. It will require the relocation of 66 urban and \n135  rural  households,  of  which  only  a  few  are  ethnic  minorities.  About  1,391  ha  will  be \npermanently  acquired,  of  which  38%  are  cultivated  and  44%  forest.  Using  PRC  planning \nstandards,  land  acquisition  will  be  equivalent  to  the  full  loss  of  land  of  about  1,600  people.  A \ntotal  of  14,589  m2  of  residential  structures  will  be  demolished,  requiring  the  relocation  of  226 \nurban and 576 rural people.  \n \n55. \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  formulated  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  laws  and  local \nregulations and with ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous people (footnote \n7). The impact on villages is modest because farms in Heilongjiang are large. Only eight village \ngroups will lose about 5% of their farmland. Special measures will be taken to assist 659 poor \nhouseholds,  11%  of  the  total  affected.  House  relocation  will  be  completed  ahead  of  time; \nhousehold  plots  will  be  provided  within  the  same  village.  Compensation  will  be  paid  before \ndisplacement of people or loss of land and will be invested in economic and social infrastructure \nto  improve  farmers\u2019  livelihoods  and  living  standards.  Economic  rehabilitation  strategies  have \nbeen  discussed  with  the  eight  most  seriously  affected  village  groups.  The  cost  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  CNY313  million,  including  contingencies,  which  anticipate  an \nincrease  in  compensation  rates  because  of  the  application  of  new  consolidated  standards. \nHPCD  distributed  an  information  booklet  to  the  affected  villages  and  households  in  February \n2006 (Appendix 20).  \n \nF. \n \n56. \nADB has classified the Project under environmental category A. The EIA report for the \nmain highway was prepared by HPCD and approved by HEPB in January 2006. The EIA for the \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003. ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nRisks \n\nSonghua River Bridge was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 4 \nApril  2006.  HPCD  ensured  that  the  Project  was  designed  and  would  be  constructed  and \noperated  in  accordance  with  government  rules  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy \n(footnote 7). HPCD will implement the environment management plan (EMP) set out in the EIA \nand  the  summary  EIA  to  mitigate  any  environmentally  adverse  project  impacts;  mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts.  The  EIA \nassessed  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  selected  alignment  of  the  main  highway  and  the \nrural  link  roads  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures.  The \nproposed alignment does not cross or impinge on any protected areas; there are no known rare \nor endangered species in the project area. The Project\u2019s major environmental impacts include \nsoil  and  water  conservation  and  erosion  control.  A  soil  erosion  prevention  plan  was  prepared \nseparately. \n \nG. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  technical,  economic,  financial,  and \nsocial  risks.  To  minimize  the  technical  risk,  international  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed \ndesign and construction methods. The prequalification of contractors will focus on their financial \nand technical capabilities in handling similar works. During construction, monitoring and contract \nmanagement information systems will be set up and implemented to identify and solve technical \nproblems.  HPCD  has  a  proven  track  record  and  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  The  financial  risk  associated  with  the  construction  and \noperation  of  the  highway  will  depend  on  the  actual  level  and  composition  of  traffic,  the \nconstruction costs, the ability of the commercial management, and the tolls charged. To control \nthe  financial  risks,  HPCD  will  create  a  commercial  business  environment  for  highway \nmaintenance,  and  the  central  and  provincial  governments  will  inject  substantial  equity  into  the \nproject  roads.  The  social  risks  include  resettlement  and  HIV/AIDS.  Mitigation  measures  are  in \nplace in the resettlement plan and social development action plan. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  following  specific  assurances  have  been \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nincorporated in the legal documents. \n \nCounterpart Financing.

The \nGovernment through HPG shall ensure that any such changes shall be carried out in a legal and \ntransparent manner. \n \n68. \nFinancial  Reporting.  During  the  construction  period  and  for  the  first  5  fiscal  years  of \ncommercial  operation,  HPCD  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  its  annual  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements,  audited  by  external  and  qualified  auditors  appointed  by  HPCD,  within  6 \nmonths after the end of each relevant fiscal year. HPCD will also establish and maintain during \nimplementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  an  internal  audit  unit,  composed  of  full-time \naccountants,  to  undertake  timely  audits  of  project  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted accounting principles. \n \n69. \nCapacity  Development.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  HPCD  will  prepare  a \nhuman resources development plan, which will include a training plan, a program of workshops \nto  be  delivered  by  people  trained  internationally,  and  a  list  of  training  equipment,  for  ADB \napproval. \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nEnvironment.  HPCD  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is  constructed  and  operated  in \n70. \naccordance  with  national  and  local  laws,  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy  (footnote  7),  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  EIA;  (ii)  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts are minimized by the mitigating measures and monitoring program in the EIA; (iii) the \nimplementation of the EMP and any violation of environmental standards are regularly reported \nto  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  specifications  set  forth  in  the  EIA;  and  (iv)  the  EMP  is \nincorporated in bidding documents and bills of quantities of the civil work contracts. \n \nVehicle  Emissions.  At  least  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  highway,  HPG  will \n71. \nprovide  to  ADB  the  HEPB  emission  standards  and  the  penalties  for  infringement  of  such \nstandards.  HPG  will  ensure  that  through  the  relevant  agencies,  the  HEPB  vehicle  emission \nstandards, as well as the national vehicle emission standards, will be enforced.  \n \n72. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement. HPG and HPCD will ensure that land acquisition \nand resettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following the resettlement plan agreed \non  with  ADB,  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law  and  ADB's  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (footnote  7).  HPG  and  HPCD  will  ensure  that \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  monitored  and  evaluated  and  reported  to  ADB  as \nrequired in the plan. \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  HPG,  through  HPCD,  shall  cause  the  contractors  involved  in \n73. \nproject  implementation  to  maximize  employment  of  local  poor  persons,  including  ethnic \nminorities,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  of  the  project.

Highways of class II and above accounted for 15.5% of \nthe total length. The road density was 20.0 km per 100 km2 in 2005. In 2004, rural roads totaled \n2.9  million  km  in  2004:  county\u2014479,372  km;  township\u2014945,180  km;  and  village\u20141,473,534 \nkm. Heilongjiang\u2019s road network made up only 3.6% of the country\u2019s total network in 2004, with \na total length of 68,821 km. Of this, 61,304 km were classified: expressways\u2014722 km; class I\u2014\n1,040  km;  class  II\u20147,034  km;  and  classes  III  and  IV\u201452,508  km.  Road  density  was  1.61  km \nper 1,000 people. By administrative standards, national, provincial, and village roads comprise \n7.5%, 12.2%, and 80.3%.  \n \n2. \nIn  2004,  the  PRC  had  26.9 million  trucks,  cars,  and  buses.  The  private  fleet  increased \nfrom  0.28 million  in  1985  to  14.8 million  in  2004.  Modernizing  the  vehicle  fleet  will  improve \nvehicle  safety  and  reduce  individual  vehicles\u2019  fuel  consumption  and  emissions.  In  2004, \nHeilongjiang  had  more  than  48,300  bus  operators,  most  small  and  private,  on  routes  shorter \nthan  150  km.  About  79,000  buses  were  registered,  including  14,000  large  buses  with  a  total \ncapacity of 300,000 seats, with average growth of 4.8% over the last 10 years. Road passenger \ntraffic in passenger-km grew 11.3% per year in 1990\u20132004, faster than the national average of \n9.0%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 9.2% per year, compared with 6.2% per year for \nthe PRC as a whole.  \n \n3. \nThe  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Communications  Department  regulates  the  road  transport \nindustry by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. Freight transport is essentially \nderegulated, but interprovincial bus routes require Ministry of Communications approval. Private \nincreasing \noperations  have \ncompetition. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or minus 20% of advisory \ntariffs  set  by  the  local  government.  This  flexibility,  coupled  with  ease  of  market  entry,  will \nfacilitate the passing on to transport users of cost reductions resulting from improved roads. \n \n4. \nExpenditures  for  highways  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges,  government \ngrants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two dedicated user \ncharges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  the  vehicle  purchase  fee,  have  provided  much  of  the \nfinancing  for  the  road  sector.  During  2001\u20132005,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle \npurchase fee provided 3.1\u20136.8% and 9.9\u201311.5% of total road investments in the PRC, and 4.6% \nand  8.3%  of  total  investments  in  Heilongjiang.  Road  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and \ndesign \nlevels.  The  Ministry  of \nCommunications reviews the designs of high-standard roads and associated structures. Design \ninstitutes are staffed with well-qualified personnel. City and county highway bureaus have their \nown  construction  units  to  carry  out  minor  projects  within  their  administrative  districts. \nCompetitive  bidding  practices  were  mandated  by  the  1999  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law.  Road \nmaintenance  is  well  organized  and  implemented  by  expressway  companies  and  highway \nadministration bureaus.  \n \n5. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road \nsector since 1991. The principal issues include the impact of road projects on poverty, design \nstandards,  construction  quality, \nroad  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \ncommercialization  and  corporatization,  and  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The  sector\u2019s \nstatus and achievements to date are summarized in the following table. \n\nthe  provincial,  prefecture,  and  county \n\ntransport  efficiency  and  quality  and \n\ninstitutes  at \n\nincreased, \n\nimproving \n\n\f \nInitiative \n1.

direct proportion to their access to reliable \nand  affordable  transport  services,  which  are,  therefore,  essential  to  strengthen  the  poverty \nimpacts  of  road  infrastructure.  The  project  area  comprises  6  counties  and  2  cities,  with  103 \ntownships, and 1,023 villages. The project area has only 2 class-I bus terminals, and 5 class-II \nand 14 class-III bus stations. Many villages and townships have no direct access to bus service; \nmore than 85% of the villages do not have even class-V rural bus stops. Expanding the access \nto  transport  services  is  a  key  strategy  in  Heilongjiang\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  under  which  a \nclass-III  bus  terminal  in  Fangzheng  county  will  be  upgraded  to  class  II,  and  90  class-III  bus \nstations and 160 bus stops will be constructed. By 2010, each township in the project area will \nhave one class-III bus station and 29% of the villages will have bus stops. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nMany  types  of  vehicles  operate  on  the  project  roads,  depending  on  accessibility  and \nroad  surface  types.  The  project  highway  from  Linkou  to  Baiquan  does  not  provide  continuous \nand consistent transport services mainly because of a missing link between Tonghe and Tieli. \nBuses provide passenger transport from Tieli to Tonghe. A bus company in Tieli plies different \nroutes, including the route to Tonghe. The company deploys eight buses a day on this route, for \nwhich  the  fare  is  CNY13  per  passenger  one  way.  On  the  180  km  Tieli\u2013Hailun  route,  the \ncompany fields only one bus, charging CNY25 per passenger. There are 1,147 trucks operating \nin Tieli, which has a total of 5,067 vehicles. \n \n3. \nThe  absence  of  a  bridge  over  the  Songhua  river  hampers  traffic  flow  between \nFangzheng and Tonghe and beyond. Ferries operate 24 hours a day in the summer, spring, and \nautumn. A floating bridge is built over the ice during winter. The river carries 400\u2013500 vehicles a \nday\u2014cars, buses, trucks, and tractors. The maximum capacity of a ferry is 20 cars or 15 trucks, \nbut  actual  loaded  vehicles  often  exceed  the  maximum  limit.  It  takes  10  minutes  for  a  ferry  to \ncross the river. The waiting time for loading and unloading is half an hour each. The one-way \nfare  is  CNY30  for  cars,  CNY70  for  buses,  and  CNY200  for  trucks.  There  are  1,800  operating \nvehicles  in  Linkou  county,  650  of  which  are  passenger  vehicles  with  7,000  seats.  Of  the \npassenger  vehicles,  229  are  buses, which  transport  2.2  million  passengers  per  year,  or  about \n6,000  passengers  per  day.  Business  activity  peaks  from  July  to  October,  and  buses  operate \nwith  30%  standees.  The  tariff  is  CNY0.17/passenger/km  but  could  rise  to  22%  on  bad  roads. \nThe passenger load is expected to rise as rail transport services become scarcer in some low-\npopulated counties. \n \nIn  Linkou  county,  1,160  trucks  with  different  load  capacities  transport  grain,  corn,  and \n4. \nbeans. Trucks transport 10,000 m3 of wood per year outside the county. The tariff is CNY0.3\u2013\nCNY0.5/ton/km. Large trucks are used: two drivers man one vehicle and work round-the-clock. \nLarge  trucks  travel  over  100,000  km  per  year.  In  Hailun,  two  passenger  transport  companies \nemploy 2,400 people. One firm has 50 buses\u201414 high quality, 23 middle level, and 13 village \nlevel. The other company owns 180 buses that go to various destinations, including Harbin. Bus \nregulation,  which  controls  the  number  of  units  operating  on  routes  and  the  ticket  prices,  will \nharm  competition,  creating  supply  shortages.  Meanwhile,  freight  vehicles  are  not  regulated  on \ntheir tariffs or axle loads. Trucks haul agricultural produce to various destinations. In 2004, the \ncounty  produced  0.6  million  tons  of  agricultural  produce,  of  which  60%  was  transported  to \ndifferent  markets,  including  Beijing  and  Harbin,  mainly  by  rail  because  of  poor  road  transport \nand high tariffs. Baiquan is a grain store of Heilongjiang, producing corn, rice, and vegetables \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLocal Needs for Transport  \n\nfor  different  markets.  Limited  transport  services,  however,  prevent  the  surplus  from  reaching \ncompetitive  markets  despite  high  demand.  Three  roads  in  Baiquan  connect  7  townships, \nencompassing  84  villages;  150  buses  operate  on  these  roads.  Fares  are  CNY  0.17\u2013CNY0.21 \nper  person  per  km,  depending  on  bus  quality.  Freight  rates  are  CNY0.45\u2013CNY0.48/ton/km, \ndepending on road conditions. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nIt is operators who propose new bus routes, and local transport administration divisions \ndo  not  undertake  overall  planning  for  the  route  network.  In  the  project  area,  although  some \ntrucks  and  buses  ply  the  villages,  service  is  limited  by  poor  roads.  Villagers  without  transport \nhave  to  rely  on  informal  means  of  transport  to  go  to  their  township  bus  station.  The  technical \nassistance survey found that the average trip for the poor was longer than that for those better \noff because villages are far from commercial centers. Such trips are costly, uncomfortable, and \ninfrequent. As a result, the poor, who often have to walk to nearby rotating village markets, can \nsell  only  the  produce  that  they  can  carry  on  their  backs.  A  second  option  is  selling  to  drive-in \ntraders who thus have stronger bargaining power. \n \n6. \nMost trips cover short distances: about 70% of all trips are within the township. Trips to \nthe  county  town  are  rare,  with  the  average  household  making  only  10  trips  per  year,  and  the \npoorest group, less than two trips. Demand for long-distance travel comes mostly from migrant \nworkers,  who  are  employed  in  the  center  cities  or  coastal  provinces  and  return  home  once  a \nyear.  Most  trips  are  for  buying  necessities,  while  only  12%  are  for  agricultural  marketing. \nWalking  and  bicycling  are  the  major  modes  of  transport  for  short-distance  trips.  As  distance \nincreases,  so  does  the  number  of  motorized  trips;  almost  no  trips  are  made  on  foot  when  the \ndistance exceeds 6 km.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe area\u2019s inadequate and insufficient transport services are highly correlated with poor \nroad condition. The technical assistance survey revealed that areas with better roads have more \ntransport services, which makes travel to markets or social facilities easier and more frequent. \nIn  Tieli  city,  where  the  road  network  is  good,  transport  services  are  relatively  well  developed, \nimplying  that  transport  services  improve  along  with  road  networks.  The  interviewed  operators \nsaid  they  were  willing  to  extend  transport  services  where  profitable,  and  villagers  who  have \nexperienced  road  upgrading  said  that  bus  services  were  indeed  extended  after  a  road  was \nupgraded.  The  village  survey  confirmed  a  close  link  between  road  access  and  the  quality  of \ntransport service.  \n \n8. \nThe  villagers  said  that  when  roads  were  improved,  the  service  improved,  while  official \nfares and trucking rates did not decrease since licensed bus operators were often constrained in \nsetting  fares.  In  many  cases,  however,  informal  transport  fares  went  down.  The  demand  for \ntravel  also  increases  significantly  as  roads  improve,  mainly  because  of  upgraded  transport \nservices,  which  eventually  help  raise  rural  incomes  and  reduce  poverty.  The  village  survey \nindicated  that  the  average  number  of  trips  in  such  areas  is  higher  than  in  areas  with  less \ndeveloped roads. The survey showed that poor farmers who rarely use roads also benefit from \nimproved  roads  as  a  result  of  better  quality  of  transport  services  by  way  of  higher  farm-gate \nprices  for  their  cash  crops  and  more  frequent  visits  from  extension  and  health  personnel  and \npublic servants and officials. \n\nTransport Services and Road Condition \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 5\n\n31\n\n \n\nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROJECT AREA \n\n \n1. \nThe  technical  assistance  survey  shows  that  less  than  10%  of  the  people  in  the  project \narea run small businesses, mainly transportation, groceries, food and grain processing, trading \nof  agricultural  products,  and  eateries.  Inadequate  road  infrastructure  has  greatly  hampered \nsmall  businesses.  The  lack  of  skills,  insufficient  starter  funds,  limited  access  to  marketing \ninformation,  and  inexperience  hinder  local  commercial  activities.  The  survey  indicates  an \ninherent  entrepreneurial  spirit  among  residents  who,  if  they  could,  would  likely  set  up \ncommercial  enterprises.  During  the  technical  assistance,  a  strategy  was  prepared  to  promote \nsmall businesses and commercial activities by (i) developing community-based enterprises such \nas  gasoline  stations,  agroprocessing,  herbal  and  homeopathic  medicines,  timber  products, \ndistribution  and  transport  systems,  hotels,  and  restaurants;  (ii)  building  roadside  stations  as \nfocal points for small businesses; and (iii) creating an economic zone in each county specifically \ntargeting  small  businesses,  which  require  government  intervention  to,  for  example,  locate  and \ngroup  similar  types  of  businesses.  The  county  governments,  with  the  provincial  government, \nhave  prepared  a  plan  to  set  up  small  enterprises  in  the  project  area  to  facilitate  community \ndevelopment in tandem with the upgrading or construction of the project roads. \n \n2. \nA wide assortment of businesses will be established that provide local communities and \ntravellers with basic needs and create local jobs. The local governments are striving to attract \nmore private investment in local businesses. In collaboration with the provincial government, the \neight  county  governments  in  the  project  area  have  prepared  a  plan  to  spur  small  enterprises. \nUnder the 11th Five-Year Plan, CNY64 million will be pumped into 18 new factories; 56% of the \nfunds  will  come  from  the  private  sector.  A  township-owned  paddy  trading  company  will  be \nestablished in Tieli county, and a  village-owned refinery factory in Hailun county (Table A5.1). \nThe county governments will (i) allocate CNY8.0 million for a special-purpose loan that will help \nresidents set up small businesses, (ii) provide entrepreneurial training to poor residents, and (iii) \ncoordinate with cooperatives in providing small enterprises with assistance such as information \ndistribution.

The county government has drafted an extensive plan to construct \n3. \nroadside  stations  in  the  project  area  to  spur  development  by  linking  the  project  roads  with \ncommunity  activities  and  to  foster  safe  driving.  Roadside  stations  normally  provide  parking \nareas; ancillary facilities such as bus terminals, gasoline stations, and local specialty markets; \nand agroprocessing facilities. In consultation with the local people, roadside stations are being \ndesigned to provide the strongest links possible between the communities and the road users \nby giving local business the chance to locate at the station. The county governments, with the \nprovincial government, have prepared a multi-phased action plan to construct roadside stations. \nEach county plans to construct one roadside station along the project highway, costing a total of \nCNY34  million  for  the  eight  counties.  The  roadside  stations  will  house  restaurants,  hotels, \nagricultural  goods  shops,  local  specialty  shops,  and  markets.  The  funds  will  come  from \ngovernment,  state-owned  enterprises,  private  enterprises,  and  cooperatives  and  stock-holding \nsystems (Table A5.2). \n \n\nTable A5.2 Roadside Station Construction Plan by County \n\n \n\nCounty \n\nLocation \n\nMajor Facilities \n\nOpening \nYear \n\nInvestment \n(CNY million) \n\nLinkou \n\nK116+000 \n\n2010 \n\nFangzheng  K118+500 \n\n2009 \n\nTonghe \n\nK306+000 \n\n2010 \n\nTieli \n\nK390+000 \n\n2009 \n\nQingan \n\nK462\uff0b000 \n\n2010 \n\nSuiling \nHailun \n\nBaiquin \n\nK495\uff0b000 \nK543\uff0b500 \nK583\uff0b800 \n\n2009 \n2009 \n\n2010 \n\nMarket, hotel, restaurants, parking place, repair \nshops, resting place \nA distribution center of farm products, tool shops, \nhotels, restaurants, parking place, repair shops \nMarket of forest products (mushrooms, garlic, \npotherb, and timber products), small hostels and \ngroceries, local timber-processing factories \nA local tourism center, local specialties shops, \nlocal eateries, hostels \nA parking place, supermarkets, hostels, gas \nstations, and repair shops \nParking place, hotels, gas stations \nA market and a bus station  \n\n6.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.0 \n\n(Private \n\n5.0 \nsector)  \n4.0 (SOE) \n1.7 \n\nFarm product distribution center, a repair shop \n\n0.6 (Private)  \n\nSOE = state-owned enterprises. \nSource: Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department and county governments.  \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33\n\nROAD SAFETY AND VEHICLE EMISSIONS \n\n \n1. \nImplementation of the Government's economic reform policies since 1978 has resulted \nin  rapid  economic  growth  and  a  persistent  increase  of  the  number  of  vehicles.  The  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  will  continue  to  experience  a  high  rate  of  motor  vehicle  growth  for \nmany  years  to  come.  The  country  is  facing  increasingly  serious  road  safety  and  vehicle \nemissions  problems,  which  inhibit  economic  and  social  development,  and  cause  millions  of \npremature  deaths  and  injuries,  increase  medical  costs,  strain  welfare  services,  and  reduce \nproductivity.  Many  problems  encountered  with  road  safety  and  vehicle  emissions  are \npredominantly \nlack  of \ninterdepartmental  coordination,  inadequate  data  systems  and  monitoring,  inadequate  action \nplans  and  integrated  strategies,  inadequate  enforcement  and  legislation,  lack  of  road  safety \naudits  and  accident  black  spot  programs,  weak  vehicle  inspection  systems,  and  shortages  of \nskilled staff and resources. \n \nA. \n\nfragmentation  of \n\nresponsibility, \n\nRoad Safety \n\ninstitutional, \n\nresulting \n\nfrom \n\n2. \nAccident  rates  in  the  PRC  are  higher  than  in  highly  motorized  countries  and  in  many \nother  developing  countries.  Road  accidents  and  their  resultant  economic  losses  represent  a \nsubstantial problem and require urgent attention by the authorities. National statistics1 show that \nin  2004,  road  traffic  accidents  resulted  in  107,077  deaths  and  460,864  injuries,  with  costs \nequivalent  to  1\u20133%  of  GDP.  In  Heilongjiang  in  2004,  there  were  16,116  accidents  that  killed \n3,825  people  and  injured  18,377.  To  address  the  issue  of  road  safety,  the  Ministry  of  Public \nSecurity  prepared  the  2004  Road  Safety  Action  Plan,  whose  primary  aims  are  to  (i)  reduce \nserious accidents (more than 10 fatalities), (ii) eliminate major accidents (30 or more fatalities), \nand (iii) facilitate implementation of the 2004 Road Safety Law. This is to be achieved through \nimproved  vehicle  safety,  driver  training,  and  improved  traffic  management.  The  traffic  police, \nwho  fall  under  the  auspices  of  the  Heilongjiang  Public  Security  Bureau,  are  responsible  for \npromoting road safety, enforcing traffic laws, and identifying preventive measures and accident \nblack  spots.  This  work  is  coordinated  with  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (HPCD) to consolidate interagency efforts.  \n \nSafety is a major factor that must be considered, along with, for example, mobility and \n3. \neconomic  and  environmental  impacts,  to  achieve  balanced  design  standards  for  roads.  The \ndesign of the highway was chosen to ensure that posted (legal) speed limits are attainable with \nan adequate margin of safety. Careful attention was given to the design of super-elevation on \ncurves,  overtaking  and  curve  sight  distances,  deceleration  lanes  at  interchanges  and  service \nareas, and adequate road camber to ensure that surface water runs off the road surface during \nheavy rainfalls.  \n \nOverloading  of  vehicles  must  be  controlled  as  road  safety  is  affected  by  the  higher \n4. \ndemands placed on vehicles\u2019 braking systems, chassis strength, and flexibility; vehicles\u2019 stability \nwhen  rounding  curves;  and  steering  difficulties  resulting  from  heavy  rear-end  loads  reducing \nfront-end weight, road contact, and friction with the road surface. HPCD will monitor operations \nin  relation  to  overloaded  vehicles  and  impose  sufficient  penalties  on  offenders  to  help  reduce \nthe  risk  of  traffic  accidents,  pavement  damage,  and  maintenance  costs.  An  efficient  penalty \nsystem  will  be  in  place  to  discourage  operators  from  overloading.  Typical  penalties  could \ninclude (i) the suspension of operators\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses, (ii) the suspension of operators\u2019 goods \nlicenses,  (iii)  a  large  fine,  and  (iv)  the  requirement  that  operators  unload  their  vehicles  and \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Security. 2004 accidents statistics.  \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nreload only to the allowable weight limit. HPCD uses the Road Safety Audit for Road Projects,2 \nwhich was developed under World Bank Highway Project in 2000. All road design and operation \nprocesses are subject to this road safety audit. Construction of the proposed highway to a high \nstandard will reduce accidents in the Jishou\u2013Chadong corridor. \n \n5. \nAn  interdepartmental  framework  will  be  established  under  the  Project  to  enhance  road \nsafety.  While  HPCD  will  concentrate  on  engineering,  road  safety  audits,  black-spot \nimprovement, and operational issues pertaining to the highway, the Heilongjiang Public Security \nBureau will deal with traffic law enforcement issues to create safer roads.  \n \n6. \nAt  least  6  months  before  the  highway  opens,  HPCD  will  (i)  implement  a  road  safety \naction  plan  with  the  help  of  consulting  services;  and  (ii)  ensure,  in  collaboration  with \nHeilongjiang  Public  Security  Bureau,  that  a  team  of  bureau  personnel  will  patrol  the  highway \nand enforce the new law and regulations. Some 20 person-months of consulting services from \ndomestic  road  safety  specialist  will  be  engaged  to  help  HPCD  develop  the  road  safety  action \nplan and check designs and safety aspects of the project roads. A rural road safety zone will be \ncreated to ensure rural road safety along the project roads. In the zone, the local government \nwill  follow  the  best  practices  to  ensure  road  safety  along  the  rural  roads.  One  rural  link  road \nsection  in  Qing\u2019an  (2.5  km)  was  selected  as  a  pilot  rural  safety  zone.  Some  $60,000  will  be \nearmarked to improve rural road safety. The accident rate and traffic volume will be monitored \nafter the operation of the highway to verify the result. \n \nB. \n \nThe increasing number of vehicles has raised concerns about vehicle emissions and air \n7. \npollution.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to control  emissions:  imposing  regulations \non  the  automobile  industry,  requiring  an  annual  vehicle  test,  and  drafting  a  vehicle  inspection \nand maintenance program. The new measures also set emission and fuel efficiency targets and \noffer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more  environmentally  friendly  cars.  Heilongjiang  has \nvehicle  emission  standards,  and  the  Heilongjiang  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  regularly \ntests all types of vehicles. The Project will have positive impacts on air pollution, as emissions \nfrom vehicles along the project roads are expected to be lower because of better traffic flows as \na  result  of  improved  roads.  Upon  completion  of  the  Project,  sulfur  dioxide  emissions  from \nvehicles  on  the  project  roads  are  estimated  to  be  30%  lower  than  before  the  Project.  Carbon \ndioxide emissions  will  be 30%  lower.  At  least  6  months  before  the  highway  opens,  HPCD  will \nprovide  ADB  with  (i)  the  regulations  for  vehicle  emission  limits  and  the  penalties  for  violating \nemission  standards;  and  (ii)  the  latest  government  plan  to  improve  air  quality  in  Heilongjiang, \nincluding  cleaner  fuel  programs.  With  the  assistance  of  consulting  services,  HPCD  and \nHeilongjiang  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  will  develop  an  action  plan  to  control  vehicle \nemissions in the area and implement it accordingly. \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

County  communication  bureaus  supply  labor  and \nequipment  to  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Highway  Bureau  local  offices.  Cities,  counties,  and \nforestry bureaus are responsible for maintaining national, provincial, and other roads that pass \nthrough the counties.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe estimated routine maintenance costs per km every year for classes I, II, III, and IV \nare  CNY30,000,  CNY15,000,  CNY11,500,  and  CNY8,000.  For  each  class,  periodic \nmaintenance  costs  per  km  for  every  9  years  are  CNY1.0  million,  CNY0.5  million,  CNY0.375 \nmillion,  and  CNY0.25  million.  Grants  for  maintenance  from  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial \nCommunications Department (HPCD) to local governments are CNY65,000 per km per year for \nclass-I roads, CNY31,000 per km per year for class II, CNY7,200 per km per year for the rest. \nEach  county  is  given  grants  according  to  the length  of  each  road  class.  A  shortfall  in  funds is \ncommon, which could result in less-than-ideal roads. \n \nB. \n \nRoad  conditions  vary  among  counties  because  of  the  available  materials:  Linkou  and \n3. \nTonghe have good gravel, while Baiquan and Hailun must haul it over 100 km. Gravel roads in \nLinkou, Fangzheng, and Tonghe are in good condition and well graded, while those in Qing\u2019an, \nSuiling, Hailun, and Baiquan have many potholes and are much rougher (Table A8.1). \n \n\nRoad Condition \n\nTable A8.1: Road Conditions  \n\n \n\nCounty \n\nSection \n\nCondition \n\nExisting \nRoad \nS309 \nS309 \nS309 \nS203 \nS203 \nS203 \nG171 \nG171 \nG023 \nG023 \n\nPavement \nType \nAC \nGravel \nGravel \nAC and PC \nGravel \nGravel \nGravel \nGravel \nGravel \nGravel \n\nIndicator of \nroughness index \n5.87 \n6.07 \n6.00 \n5.10 \n6.68 \n7.92 \n8.61 \n7.12 \n7.59 \n7.61 \n\nFair \nGood \nGood \nFair \nFair \nPoor \nPoor \nPoor \nPoor \nPoor \n\nLinkou \nLinkou \nFangzheng \nFangzheng \nTonghe \nTieli \nQing\u2019an \nSuiling \nHailun \nBaiquan \n\nLinkou Bypass \nJintang to Daluomi \nJintang to Daluomi \nFangzheng to Tonghe \nTonghe to Tieli \nTonghe to Tieli \nQing\u2019an to Suiling \nQing\u2019an to Suiling \nHailun to Baiquan \nHailun to Baiquan \nAC, = asphalt concrete, PC = cement concrete. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants\u2019 estimates. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nAdequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads.  Local \nadministrative units are responsible for such maintenance, but the quality of rural roads does not \nseem  to  be  systematically  monitored  by  the  higher  authorities.  Maintenance  planning  often \nhinges  on  a  subjective  assessment,  mainly  because  of  the  local  government\u2019s  inability  to \nmaintain its road networks because of lack of resources. While local authorities draft plans for \nroutine  maintenance  work,  periodic  maintenance  is  budget-driven  and  lacks  a  systematic, \npreventive approach.  \n \n\nIssues and Problems \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n5. \nThe maintenance system for class-II roads or above seems reasonable. However, there \nis no official funding channel to maintain township or village roads, which are mostly in class IV \nor  below,  or  a  system  to  enable  provincial  governments  to  fund  rural  road  development.  A \nreliable  funding  mechanism  to  maintain  and  rehabilitate  rural  roads  must  be  designed.  Since \nfunds for maintenance are limited, a simple method to evaluate and prioritize maintenance must \nalso be established to streamline work programming and make the most effective use of funds. \n \n6. \nApart  from  financial  constraints,  local  governments\u2019  maintenance  efforts  are  often \nhampered  by  a  lack  of  qualified  technical  and  managerial  personnel,  training  resources,  and \nequipment. Local governments must develop the capacity to contract out road maintenance. In \ntandem,  start-up  assistance  must  be  extended  to  local  road  maintenance  contractors  in  rural \nareas, ways to create jobs for the rural poor identified, and a suitable performance monitoring \nsystem put in place. \n \n7. \nA major problem is pavement damage from overloaded trucks. As trucks have become \nbigger, the problem will continue. Although the Ministry of Communications does have axle load \nlimits,  these  are  not  enforced  partly  because  suitable  truck-weighing  equipment  is  lacking. \nSuitable  weighing  machines  must  therefore  be  installed  at  each  of  the  nine  toll  stations,  and \nsystematic  checks  carried  out  for  overweight  vehicles.  Other  maintenance  equipment \nrecommended  for  procurement  include  snow  removal  vehicles,  graders,  loaders,  pavement \npatch  mobile  mixers, \nload \nmeasurement, and emergency tow trucks. \n \nD. \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  an  action  plan  (Table  A8.2)  was  established  to  strengthen \n8. \nlocal road maintenance. The action plan was agreed with HPCD. Following the plan, HPCD will \ndevelop  and  implement  a  sound  road  maintenance  management  system  during  project \nimplementation.  The  system  will  have  (i)  measures  that  minimize  maintenance  costs;  (ii) a \nmodern  method  to  prioritize  evaluation  and  maintenance  for  efficient  work  programming  and \nfund use; (iii) a compilation of road inventories, together with basic data on the condition of the \nroads; and (iv) a monitoring system to be used by local residents. HPCD will encourage county \ngovernments  to  adopt  competitive  bidding  among  maintenance  contractors  to  enhance \nefficiency.  The  Project  will  provide  a  training  program  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernment maintenance units. \n \n\ntankers,  generators,  cherry  pickers,  mobile  axle \n\nRecommendation \n\nrollers, \n\nTable A8.2: Action Plan \n \n\nRequirements \n\nActivity  \nClassified Roads \n \n\nBridges \nUnclassified Roads \n \nCapacity Building \n\nFund \n\nDevelop a functional classification for the road system \nDetermine the importance of each road in the overall road network \nEstablish a road condition system \nDevelop road maintenance work priorities \nAssign a cost for each activity and define overall cost \nCarry out the same process for the maintenance of bridges \nProvide basic funding and technical advice to help maintenance of unclassified roads \nProvide basic materials to the small communities  \nAssign the Communications College to carry out capacity building and ongoing \ntraining to enhance local capacity \nOptimize the maintenance fund, and ensure the sustainability of the road networks \n\n  Source: Technical assistance consultants\u2019 estimates. \n\n\fLocation \n\nDate \n\nParticipants \n\nPurposes \n\nHeilongjiang Social Science Academy \nAll \ncounties  \n\nJun, 2005 to Dec, \n2005 \n\nPUBLIC CONSULTATIONS \n \n\nNo. of \nParticipants \n\nHeilongjiang Social \nScience Academy, \nCounty and township \ngovernment officials \nand villagers \n\n812 \nhouseholds, \nmore than \n1,000 people \nseparately  \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n39\n\n\u2022  Conduct a social and poverty \n\nfield survey  \n\n\u2022  Collect socioeconomic data  \n\u2022  Collect data on impact of land \n\nacquisition and house \ndemolition \n\n\u2022  Survey attitudes toward the \n\nproject \n\n\u2022 \n\nIntroduce the Project to \nparticipants \n\n\u2022  Collect information on poverty \n\nand social issues \n\u2022  Collect information on \n\neconomic conditions and \npoverty \n\n\u2022  Survey villages for social and \n\npoverty impacts  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIntroduce the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s \nresettlement policy \n\n\u2022  Discuss the compensation \npolicy and the process and \ntiming of resettlement \n\n\u2022  Consult with stakeholders on \n\nincome restoration and \nrelocation strategies \n\n\u2022  Assess resettlement impact \n\nIntroduce the Project and  \ndiscuss environmental impact \nand environmental mitigation \nmeasures \n\nIntroduce the Project, \nincluding road alignment, and \nengineering work \n\n\u2022  Discuss alignment selection, \nforest and wildlife resource \nand protection, protection of \nthe water resource, and \nresettlement issues.  \n\n\u2022  Collect public environmental \ninformation, relevant wildlife \nresources  \n\n\u2022  Discuss environmental \nmitigation measures \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nPPTA Team of Social and Poverty Analysis \n10\u201312 Nov 2005 \nBaiquan  \n13\u201315 Nov 2005 \nHailun  \n16\u201318 Nov 2005 \nSuiling  \n26\u201327 Nov 2005 \nQingan  \n24\u201326 Dec 2005 \nTonghe \n24\u201325 Nov 2005 \nLinkou  \n\nPPTA Team of Resettlement \nBaiquan  \nHailun  \nSuiling  \nQingan  \n\n15 Nov 2005 \n17 Nov 2005 \n18 Nov 2005 \n20 Nov 2005 \n\nTieli  \n\n21\u201322 Nov 2005 \n\nTonghe \n\n24 Nov 2005 \n\nLinkou  \n\n25\u201326 Nov 2005 \n\n2004\u20132006 \n\nEIA Team \nCounties, \ntownships, \nvillages, \nschools \nPPTA Team of Environmental Impact Assessment \nTieli  \n\nAffected people, \nfarmers, workers, \ntownship and village \nlevel representative  \n\n26 Oct 2005 \n\nCounty government \nofficials, education \nbureau, women\u2019s \nunion, health bureau, \nminority bureau, \ncommunication \nbureau, poverty \nreduction, village \nleaders and villagers \n\nCounty government \nofficials, education \nbureau, women\u2019s \nunion, health bureau, \nminority bureau, \ncommunication \nbureau, poverty \nreduction, village \nleaders and villagers \n\nCounty government \nand its agencies \nprotection bureau, \nbureau, forest bureau, \nwater resource \nbureau, agricultural \nbureau, cultural relic \nbureau, land \nadministration \nbureau, design \ninstitute \n\n75 \n45 \n31 \n53 \n47 \n62 \n\n32 \n34 \n45 \n30 \n25 \n28 \n35 \n26 \n39 \n\n12 \n\n9 \n\n13 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n13 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n700 \n\nQing\u2019an \n\n27 Oct 2005 \n\nSuiling \n\n27 Oct 2005 \n\nHailun \n\n28 Oct 2005 \n\nBaiquan \n\n28 Oct 2005 \n\nLinkou  \n\n3 Nov 2005 \n\nFangzheng   4 Nov 2005 \n\nTonghe  \n\n5 Nov 2005 \n\nEIA = environmental impact assessment, PPTA = project preparatory technical assistance.  \nSource: Heilongjiang Provincial Communications Department and TA consultants\u2019 estimates. \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATE BY FINANCIER \n($ million) \n \n\nCost \n\nADB \n\nAmount \n\n% of Cost \nCategory \n \n\nChina Development \nBank \n\nAmount \n\n% of Cost \nCategory \n\nMOC and HPG \n\n% of Cost \nCategory \n\nAmount \n\n \n\n \n\n4\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n \n\ni\n\n  \nItem    \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

Better  road  infrastructure  and  services  will  encourage  villagers  to  go  to  markets,  use \neducational and health facilities more frequently, and avail themselves of increased agricultural \nextension services. These benefits, which accrue directly to road users, are the Project\u2019s direct \neffects.  Improved  access  will  expand  economic  activities  and  gradually  lead  to  structural \nchanges in production and consumption patterns and in the labor market. Lower transport costs \nreduce  the  costs  of  traded  farm  inputs,  thereby  raising  agricultural  productivity  and  profitability. \nCropping  patterns  change  with  better  roads,  as  farmers  shift  to  high-value  crops  because  of \neasier  access  to  markets  and  new  farming  technologies.  Better  roads  help  increase  nonfarm \njobs, raise wages, and reduce transaction costs, thereby spurring commercial activities. In turn, \nhigher  incomes  boost  local  people\u2019s  demand  for  transport  and  the  movement  of  goods  and \nservices. These are the benefits that trickle down to local people over time. Even the rural poor \nwho rarely use roads also benefit from improved roads through cheaper goods and services and \nincreased economic opportunities. These are the Project\u2019s indirect effects.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nBased  on  the  findings  of  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance,  a \nstandard monitoring framework and a set of monitoring indicators were designed to measure the \nactual  benefits  (Table  A13.1).  The  indicators  were  chosen  to  assess  the  hypothesized  flow  of \nproject benefits. Monitoring will focus on a few representative communities in the project area.1 \n \n\nMonitoring Framework \n\nTable A13.1: Monitoring Framework: Indicators and Mechanism \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nTravel time to county center \n\nTiming of Benefits or Outcomes \nA.

In 2004, the total population in the project area was \n3.4 million. Economic development in the project area lagged behind other counties.  \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nBased  on  the  origin\u2013destination  and  traffic  counts  survey,  the  428  km  Jixi\u2013Nehe \nprovincial highway was divided into five sections for the traffic forecast. The associated rural link \nroads,  totaling  170  km,  were  assigned  to  the  corresponding  highway  sections  to  form  five \nseparate  networks  (Table  A14.1,  and  Map  2).  The  average  trip  distance  between  two  points \nalong the highway was a major factor in the sectional division. The geographical location of the \nalignment  as  regards  altitude  and  existing  road  conditions  were  also  considered.  Normal, \ndiverted, and generated traffic were then forecast for each network. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Project Road by Section \n \n\nMain highway \n\nRural link roads \n\n \n\nItem \n\nNo of sections \n\nTotal length (km) \n\nTo \nDailumi \nTonghe \nTieli \nSuilinh \nBaiquan \n \n\nFrom \nLinkou \nFangzheng \nTonghe \nQingan \nHailun \n \n\nLength (km) \n102.0 \n22.2 \n155.4 \n70.3 \n78.3 \n428.2 \n\n7 \n0 \n3 \n7 \n7 \n22 \n\n69.9 \n0.0 \n15.4 \n42.0 \n43.2 \n170.4 \n\nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \nSection 4 \nSection 5 \nProject \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3. \nProject highway in section 1 (102 km) starts at Xinhua and ends at the point where most \ntraffic from Xinhua will terminate. It includes the Linkou bypass and a new section from Jiantong \nto  the  border  of  Fangzheng,  which  crosses  rolling-to-hilly  terrain.  The  traffic  on  this  section\u2014\nnow normal on the S309\u2014will be augmented by traffic that will be diverted from Jixi and Linkou \ntoward the provincial center, which now uses the expressway via Mudanjiang. Seven sections of \nrural link roads, totaling 69.9 km, are included in this section. \n \n4. \nProject  highway  in  section  2  (22.2  km)  starts  at  Fangzheng  county  to  Tonghe  town. \nThese two points are separated by the Songhua river. Section 2 has an extra-large bridge (2.5 \nkm)  crossing  the  Songhua.  The  traffic  along  section  2\u2014normal  traffic  plying  Fangzheng  and \nTonghe uses a ferry to cross the river\u2014will be augmented by generated traffic and diverted to \nTieli and Qing\u2019an. \n \n5. \nProject highway in section 3 (155.4 km) starts at Tonghe and ends on the Yha Highway \nwest of Tieli, passing through Tonghe and Tieli county, crossing a denuded forest. The road is \nbad  and  often  impassable.  The  terrain  is  hilly.  The  roads  see  little  traffic  now,  but  after  the \nProject,  the  traffic  passing  through  the  provincial  center  will  be  diverted  and  be  able  to  go \ndirectly from point to point. Three sections of rural link roads, totaling 15.4 km, are included. \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections \n\n6. \nProject highway in section 4 (70.3 km) starts on the Yha Highway east of Qing\u2019an and \nends  on  the  Suibei  Highway  just  east  of  Suiling.  The  road  that  connects  the  two  towns  is  of \nrough gravel. The area is mainly agricultural and flat. Seven sections of rural link roads (totaling \n42 km) are included. Section 5 (78.3 km) starts on the Suibei Highway just west of Hailun city \nand  ends  on  the  Baiquan\u2013Nehe  highway  just  west  of  Baiquan.  Similarly,  this  road  passes \nthrough  mainly  agricultural  and  flat  lands.  Seven  sections  of  rural  link  roads  (43.2  km)  are \nincluded. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe origin\u2013destination and traffic count surveys along the project roads were conducted \nin  2004  by  the  Design  Institute.  The  average  annual  daily  traffic  on  the  project  roads  was \nestimated based on the 2004 traffic count surveys. \n \n8. \nTraffic  was  projected  based  on  the  economic  growth  forecast  for  the  project  area  and \nhistorical  growth  trends  in  traffic.  The  calculations  also  took  into  account  potential  traffic \ngeneration and diversion caused by (i) enhanced development opportunities resulting from the \nProject, (ii) traffic transferring to the project highway from existing roads in the project area, and \n(iii) traffic transferring away from the project highway because of toll charges.  \n \n9. \nThree  types  of  traffic  are  analyzed:  normal,  diverted,  and  generated.  Normal  traffic  is \nwhat currently occurs on the project road. The size of normal traffic depends on the accessibility \nof an area and the condition of the road. There is no road at the Songhua river and a section \nbetween Tonghe and Teili. Ferries operate across the river throughout the year, except for 20 \ndays in winter. It takes 10 minutes to cross the river by ferry, but the waiting time at either end is \n30 minutes. Therefore, it takes 70 minutes to cross the river. \n \n10. \nThe  origin\u2013destination  survey  shows  that  some  traffic  from  other  roads  would  divert  to \nthe project roads.1 Diversion could occur (i) along the section between Linkou and Fangzheng, \nfrom Linkou or Jixi and Harbin; (ii) from Tieli and beyond, toward Linkou, where other detours \nare  used;2 and  (iii)  along  the  Tieli\u2013Tonghe\u2013Fangzheng  section,3 from  Qing\u2019an  and  beyond  to \nFangzheng and Linkou and Jixi areas. A total of 170 vehicles are expected to be diverted to the \nTieli\u2013Tonghe\u2013Fangzheng section. \n \n11. \nThe  road  improvement  will  spur  transport  demand.  The  project  area  covers  2.3  million \nha: paddy land (15%), dry land (42%), wood land (14%), and waste land (29%). Some 87% of \nthe wood land is in Tonghe and Tieli, while 13% is in Hailun and Baiquan. Although Tonghe is \none of the poorest counties, its timber industry would have tremendous potential with improved \ntransport.  Baiquan  is  also  one  of  the  poorest  counties;  its  crops,  mainly  rice  and  corn,  have \nsimilarly  big  potential.  Inadequate  transport  hampers  the  transport  of  coal  in  Baiquan  to  the \nnearest railway station. \n \n12. \nThrough and local traffic were analyzed using the origin\u2013destination survey. On average, \n62% of the traffic generated ended up within the eight counties/cities. The highest percentage \n(82%)  was  registered  in  Tonghe,  and  the  lowest  (37%)  in  Suiling.  The  traffic  generated  in \nTonghe remained within the county because of inadequate roads. Local traffic in Tonghe is 1.3 \ntimes  that  of  the  other  counties  and  1.9  times  that  of  the  major  cities.  Upgrading  the  project \n                                                 \n1  Since the railway does not run parallel to the project road, traffic from the railway is unlikely to divert to it. \n2  Based  on  the  origin\u2013destination  survey,  80%  of  the  traffic  from  the  Linkou\u2013Fangzheng  section  is  assumed  to \ntransfer to the new road, which will shorten the distance between Linkou and Fangzheng by 44 km. A total of 1,342 \nvehicles are expected to divert to the Linkou\u2013Fangzheng section. \n\n3  This  section  is  not  rendering  the  required  transport  services  because  of  a  broken  portion  between  Tieli  city  and \n\nTonghe county and the disconnection across the Songhua river. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n47\n\nroads will substantially increase traffic in the project area, in general, and between the Songhua \nbridge and Tieli city, in particular. \n \n13. \nThe Project will make it easier for the residents in the western part of the project area to \nbring  their  agricultural  surplus  to  markets  in  the  eastern  part,  motivating  them  to  increase \nproduction.  Upgrading  the  Qing\u2019an\u2013Suiling  and  Hailun\u2013Baiquan  sections  will  increase  traffic. \nThe  Project  will  connect  the  two  broken  ends  of  the  Fangzheng\u2013Tonghe  and  Tonghe\u2013Tieli \nroads,  making  transport  smoother  and  more  efficient  between  the  Xiaoxing\u2019anling  forest  zone \nand the economically developed southern areas, including Jilin province. The Tonghe\u2013Songhua \nbridge will be critical in boosting economic growth of the less developed areas. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  demand  for  transport  and \nreduce  transport  costs,  travel  times,  and  accidents.  The  average  annual  daily  traffic  on  the \nproject  roads  is  forecast  to  reach  1,752\u20133,939  vehicles  in  2010,  when  the  Project  begins \noperation; 3,920\u20137,636 in 2020; and 7,549\u201312,979 by 2029 (Table A14.2). \n \n\nTable A14.2: Traffic Forecast, Average Annual Daily Traffic, Selected Years \n\n \n\nItem \n\nFrom\u2013To \n\nYear \n\nCar \n\nBus \n\nTruck \n\nSection 1 \n\nLinkou\u2013Dailumi \n\nSection 2 \n\nFangzheng\u2013Tonghe \n\nSection 3 \n\nTonghe\u2013Tieli \n\nSection 4 \n\nQuig\u2019an\u2013Suiling \n\nSection 5 \n\nHailun\u2013Baiquan \n\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2029\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2029\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2029\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2029\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2029\n\n694 \n1,801 \n2,538 \n3,593 \n4,941 \n6,308 \n567 \n1,532 \n2,209 \n3,201 \n4,507 \n5,863 \n422 \n784 \n1,162 \n1,730 \n2,481 \n3,263 \n564 \n1,071 \n1,706 \n2,724 \n4,298 \n6,166 \n529 \n949 \n1,453 \n2,236 \n3,316 \n4,478 \n\n231 \n553 \n720 \n941 \n1,190 \n1,419 \n188 \n463 \n608 \n802 \n1,027 \n1,239 \n141 \n236 \n315 \n422 \n545 \n659 \n187 \n305 \n417 \n571 \n773 \n981 \n176 \n281 \n383 \n525 \n697 \n864 \n\nTotal  \n\n308 \n792  \n\n252 \n686  \n989  \n\n188 \n366  \n567  \n884  \n\nHeavy \nTruck \n308 \n1,540 \n792   3,939 \n1,106   1,106   5,469 \n1,551   1,551   7,636 \n2,095   2,095   10,322 \n2,626   2,626   12,979 \n252 \n1,260 \n684   3,364 \n987   4,793 \n1,433   1,430   6,866 \n2,000   1,997   9,530 \n2,573   2,569   12,243 \n188 \n938 \n366   1,752 \n568   2,612 \n885   3,920 \n1,328   1,329   5,684 \n1,812   1,815   7,549 \n250 \n1,251 \n458   2,292 \n704   3,532 \n1,087   1,084   5,466 \n1,656   1,652   8,379 \n2,309   2,303   11,758 \n1,174 \n235 \n426   2,082 \n658   3,153 \n1,022   1,022   4,805 \n1,529   1,529   7,072 \n2,081   2,080   9,503 \n\n235 \n426  \n658  \n\n250 \n459  \n705  \n\nNote: Traffic level for the base year of 2005 is a weighted average over section.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nThe  Project  comprises  the  construction  or  upgrading  of  5  sections  of  the  Jixi\u2013Nehe \nprovincial highway, totaling 428 km, and the upgrading of 22 sections of rural link roads, totaling \n170  km.  The  economic  evaluation  was  carried  out  using  highway  design  and  maintenance \n(HDM)-4. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project highway was estimated by \ncomparing  the  project  case  for  20  years  after  improvement,  with  a  base  case  involving  the \ncontinued  use  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  road.  Without  the  Project,  congestion  would \nincrease,  resulting  in  delays,  higher  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC),  and  more  accidents.  The \nProject,  with  its  reduced  travel  distance  and  travel  time,  safer  design,  and  better  road \nconditions, will reduce VOCs and accident risks along the corridor. \n \n2. \nEconomic evaluation was undertaken using 2005 prices. The prices were expressed in \nyuan, employing the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for \nforeign  exchange  effects.  A  shadow  price  was  used  to  put  an  economic  value  on  the  wages \npaid  to  unskilled  labor,  but  not  on  the  wages  paid  to  skilled  labor,  because  no  skilled  worker \nsurplus exists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate to \nan economic opportunity cost of labor. The economic costs include (i) the capital cost, including \nphysical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs; \nand  (ii)  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  highway,  including  the  costs  of  replacing \ndepreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  were  based  on  their \nopportunity costs; that is, the agricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities.1 \n \n3. \nThe  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOC  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of the passengers\u2019 time and of \nfreight  tied  up  in  transit,  and  (iii)  savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents.  Lower  VOC  are  the \nmain  source  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project.  Traffic  using  the  highway  will  enjoy  higher \nspeeds on a smoother road with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less congestion, and a \nshorter journey distance. Traffic remaining on the alternative routes along the highway will also \nbenefit from the corresponding reduction in traffic volume and congestion, as vehicles switch to \nthe new project roads.  \n \nEstimates  for  savings  in  VOC  and  travel  time  were  calculated  using  HDM-4.  The \n4. \neconomic  cost  of  accidents  was  estimated  using  the  information  available  at  insurance \ncompanies in Harbin, which calculate economic costs of an accident in terms of direct property \ndamage  and  forgone  income.  Fatality,  injury,  and  property  damage  costs  were  assumed  at \nCNY100,000,  CNY7,500,  and  CNY7,000.  The  value-added  of  tourism  was  measured  as  the \nbenefits  generated  from  tourism  development  by  comparing  situations  with  and  without  the \nProject.  In  Linkou,  through  which  one  of  rural  link  roads  passes,  Melanhe  river  and  Lake \nLianhua are potential tourist attractions. At present, about 10,000 tourists visit the sites per year; \nthe  Project  is  expected  to  draw  in  more  visitors,  boosting  tourist  revenue  5%  per  year.  It  was \nassumed that 30% of the increased tourist revenue could be attributed to the Project. \n \n5. \nThe 428 km Jixi\u2013Nehe provincial highway was divided into five sections for the economic \nanalysis. The associated rural link roads, totaling 170 km, were assigned to the corresponding \nhighway sections to form five separate networks. An EIRR was calculated for each network. The \nEIRR for the five road sections swings from 15% to 26%, with a consolidated EIRR of 21.2%. At \na 10% rate of discount, the net present value (NPV) calculated for each project section ranges \n\n                                                 \n1  The  economic  opportunity  costs  of  land  were  assumed  to  be  equivalent  to  the  replacement  value  of  farmland, \nwhich was calculated for land compensation.

The local \ninflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic cost escalation \nfactor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign exchange was \nassumed to be 1.9%. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking into account the \npotential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n2. \nOperating  revenues  from  tolls  were  projected  based  on  forecast  traffic  and  a  base  toll \nrate of CNY0.35 per passenger car per km. Given the specific length of the road between toll \nplazas,  a  schedule  of  toll  rates  per  plaza  was  devised  with  corresponding  tolls  for  all  vehicle \ntypes\u2014for  a  light  truck,  small  bus  or  medium-sized  truck,  large  bus  or  truck;  and  for  an \narticulated  truck  or  a  trailer.2 The  toll  charges  are  assumed  to  increase  in  current  terms  once \nevery 5 years to keep up with inflation. Given the complexity of the civil works, the capital cost of \nthe Project is much higher than for other highway projects. \n \nAnnual  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  calculated  based  on  2005 \n3. \nprices: (i) toll operation costs were estimated at 150 staff members with annual salary costs of \nCNY25,000  per  employee;  (ii)  administration  costs  were  assumed  to  be  CNY3.79  million  per \nyear, with an annual increase of 3%; and (iii) maintenance costs were estimated at CNY12,000 \nper  km  per  year  for  routine  work  and  CNY0.5  million  per  km  for  periodic  work.  Periodic \nmaintenance was scheduled for 2018 and 2024. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are \ncharged on revenue. Corporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting business \ntaxes, depreciation and interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried \nforward. An estimated 5% of passenger cars forecast to be localized traffic were considered to \nbe exempt from paying tolls. \n \n4. \nAn  ADB  loan,  a  loan  from  China  Development  Bank,  and  grants  from  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications  and  the  Heilongjiang  provincial  government  are  expected  to  cover  project \nfinancing.  The  ADB  loan  amounts  to  $200  million,  with  standard  ordinary  capital  resources \nterms  of  25  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period.  The  grants  from  the  ministry  and  the \ngovernment  amount  to  38%  of  project  costs,  which  will  be  viewed  as  project  equity.  China \nDevelopment Bank will provide CNY1.2 billion, with a 20-year repayment period at an interest \nrate of 6.12%.  \n \n5. \nProjected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Table  A16.  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that the revenues are adequate to cover operation and maintenance costs, \nbut net income is negative in the first 5 years of operation because of high depreciation costs \nand high interest payments. The cash flow projections show a positive cash flow throughout the \nproject  period.  The  financial  projections  indicate  that  operational  efficiency  is  satisfactory \nalthough  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  more  than  1.2  is  achievable  only  after  5  years  of \noperation. The debt\u2013equity ratio will be about 64:36 for the first year and will gradually improve \nthereafter. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced  by  ADB. 1 A  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  based  on  the \nProject\u2019s  capital  cost,  the  most  recent  traffic  forecasts,  and  the  proposed  toll  rates.  Sensitivity \ntests  were  conducted  by  varying  the  project  costs,  traffic  volumes,  and  toll  rates  and \ncombinations  of  these  factors.  The  financial  evaluation  was  computed  over  4  years  of \nconstruction and 20 years of operations. The calculations are in constant 2005 prices.  \n \n2. \nThe local inflation rates were assumed at 3% during the projection period. The domestic \ncost escalation factor for the People\u2019s Republic of China is 3%. The price escalation for foreign \nexchange was assumed to be 1.9%. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking \ninto account the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation. \n \n3. \nHeilongjiang  province  is  applying  unified  toll  rates  to  all  class-II  highways  according  to \nthe  provincial  government\u2019s  policy,  which  is  about  30%  lower  than  for  expressways.  The  toll \nrates were developed based on the government\u2019s toll road policies, affordability for road users, \nand  neighboring  provinces\u2019  toll  rates.  To  calculate  the  FIRR,  existing  toll  rates  in  Heilongjiang \nhave been used for the first 5 years of operation and increased once every 5 years thereafter. \nThe project capital cost is much higher than for other highway projects in the province because \nof the construction of the Songhuajang bridge and difficult geographic and geological conditions. \nApplicable  business  taxes  of  5.5%  are  charged  on  revenues.  Corporate  income  tax  of  33%  is \npaid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation  and  interest  charges,  and \noperating expenses.    \n \n4. \nThe major assumptions used to calculate the FIRR are the following: (i) all calculations \nare made in 2005 prices, covering 2006 to 2029; (ii) capital costs include all incremental capital \nexpenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment  for  the  highway,  but  exclude  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  and  maintaining  costs  include  all \nannual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  highway,  but  exclude  depreciation  and \ndebt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in financial projections were \nalso adjusted to 2005 prices; and (v) the residual value of the project capital cost was estimated \nto be 40% for the bridge and 15% for roads after 20 years of operation. \n \n5. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms, was calculated at \n2.78%, using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% was used \nfor ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.12% per annum is used for the domestic loan \nfunds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8.00%. The cost of debt was also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income of 33%. \n \n6. \nThe  FIRR,  computed  after  tax,  is  calculated  at  6.53%  (Table  A17.1),  higher  than  the \nWACC of 2.78%.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n\nThe Project was developed in a participatory manner and to plan sustainable transport. It involves upgrading 428 km of \nthe  Jixi-Nehe  provincial  highway  (particularly  between  Linkou  and  Baiquan)  in  Heilongjiang  province;  constructing  170 \nkm  of  rural  link  roads,  which  serve  isolated  poor  counties  and  townships;  providing  consultancy  services  and  training; \nundertaking project monitoring and evaluation; and improving road safety. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                            Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n\nAccording to Heilongjiang\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan on Poverty, 600 villages will implement the poverty reduction program in \n2006\u20132007, 700 villages in 2008\u20132009, and the final 780 villages in 2010\u20132011. \n\nTwo counties are poor\u2014Baiquan and Tonghe. The Heilongjiang Social Science Academy survey shows that there  are \n26 poor villages in 36 townships in the project area, 65% are located in Baiquan and Tonghe. \n\nThe  poverty  analysis  has  demonstrated  the  Project  will  have  significant  impacts  on  rural  people,  including  improved \naccess to education, health, and information. An estimated 379,509 poor people in the project area will directly benefit \nfrom the Project. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n Yes \n\n \n\n No  \n\nThe stakeholder analysis is reflected in the social and poverty analysis report, and its recommendations are in the social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP). The analysis revealed that most stakeholders across a wide spectrum of government \nagencies  (health,  poverty,  education,  religion,  tourism,  women)  supported  the  project  at  both  the  county  and  village \nlevels.  Mayors  often  participated  in  the  field  work  along  with  key  village  leaders.  The  analysis  suggested  a  number  of \nissues that have been integrated into the SDAP to mitigate negative or adverse impacts and to diversify farmers\u2019 income \nthrough new small-business opportunities and job creation. \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n Yes \n\n \n\n No \n\nThe  SDAP  follows  a  consultative  approach  during  implementation.  Village  leaders  and  stakeholders  are  involved  in \nmonitoring the Project\u2019s progress. \n\nThe  project  strategy  is  to  maximize  employment  benefits  from  road  construction;  increased  job  opportunities  are \nexpected to benefit the poor. Women will support and actively participate in the road safety component, especially where \nyoung school children cross the roads. This has been proposed in the SDAP. \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nThe Project will have no adverse impacts on women.  Women are expected to gain from new opportunities such as new \nagricultural products, and improved roads will help women receive faster emergency health care. \n\nFifty percent of the stakeholders consulted during the social survey were women.  Targeting female road users, gender \nfocus  groups  were  held  in  targeted  villages,  including  those  with  ethnic  minorities.    Women  were  found  to  be  heavily \ninvolved  in  the  transport  sector  through  either  in  truck  or  as  bus  operators  and  were  keen  to  support  the  Project  and \nlooked forward to the benefits from an improved road system. \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n \n\n55\n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n \n\n Yes, see SDAP \n\n No \n\nGender issues have been considered in the poverty and social analysis and actions are included in the SDAP. \n\nE.

Furthermore, the improved roads and transport cost \nsaving will more than offset the cost of tolls. \n\nLaws and contractor provisions require equal pay for equal work \nand prohibit child labor. \n\nLess than 1% of people in the project area are ethnic minorities, \nmostly Chaoxian and Manchu. An estimated 329 households will \nbe affected by land acquisition. A social assessment of ethnic \nminorities found no significant impacts. Measures to mitigate \nadverse impacts or enhance benefits are included in the \nresettlement plan and SDAP. \nThe upgraded highway could increase risks of HIV/AIDS, \nsexually transmitted infections (STIs), and human trafficking \namong mobile populations and local communities, especially \nwomen. The local health, civil affairs, labor, and other relevant \nagencies will coordinate with the construction contractors in \ndelivering information on how to prevent HIV/AIDS, STIs, and \nhuman trafficking; voluntary counseling and testing; and \ncondoms, HIV testing kits, and STI treatment packages. The \nagencies will strictly follow the laws and regulations on \npreventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs. The provincial \ngovernment has an active HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention \nprogram. This risk will be monitored under SDAP and \nenvironmental management plan. \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None  \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n                                                 \n\n1  ADB. 1995.

The  Project  will  affect  8  counties,  36  townships,  130  administrative  villages,  6 \nforest  bureaus,  and  24  forest  stations.  About  1,391  ha  will  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which \n38% of the total is cultivated and 44% forest. Land acquisition will directly affect the equivalent of \n5,663 households. Another 428 ha will be temporarily used during construction. A total of 25,034 \nm2 of structures will be demolished. In total, house demolition will affect 201 households and 11 \nenterprises.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) has closely consulted local officials and affected people and village committees during the \npreliminary  design  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plan.  Ethnic  minorities  belonging  to \nvulnerable  groups  will  get  special  assistance  in  economic  rehabilitation  and  priority  for  career \ntraining. All affected minorities will be relocated in the original villages. \n \nA. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  resettlement  program  is  to  ensure  that  the  affected  people  will \n2. \nimprove their standards of living, or at least not be made worse off by the Project, consistent with \nthe  laws  and  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \nresettlement policy.1  The resettlement plan is based on the provisions of the Land Administration \nLaw  of  1998  and  the  new  regulations  stemming  from  the  State  Council  Decision  to  Deepen \nReform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration.  Heilongjiang  Land  Administration  Regulation \nand Forest Law also apply to resettlement under the Project. \n \nthose  affected,  a  set  of \n3. \ncompensation  standards,  based  on  the  replacement  cost,  was  formulated  by  Heilongjiang \nProvincial  Communications  Department  (HPCD)  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and \nResources.  The  resettlement  principles  set  for  the  Project  follow:  (i)  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized by developing and comparing a series \nof design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements are based on market value; (iii) land \ntemporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) the per capita \nlandholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; (v) \nthe  standard,  other \nis  not  sufficient \nwhere \nincome-generating  activities  will  be  provided;  (vi)  a  preferential  policy  will  be  provided  to \nvulnerable  groups,  including  compensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer  assistance,  and \nemployment; (vii) all those affected will be adequately informed about details of compensation; \nand  (viii)  close  monitoring  and  timely  actions  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  and  resolve  any \nproblems.   \n \n4. \nThe  compensation  for  permanent  arable  land  acquisition  is  set  at  10  times  the  annual \naverage  output  value  (AAOV)  in  the  past  3  years,  and  this  is  combined  with  a  resettlement \nsubsidy calculated at six times the AAOV for all types of cultivated land. The compensation for \nforest land includes four parts: reforestation fee, resettlement subsidy, land compensation, and \nforest compensation. All the compensation for forest land has been paid to the State Forestry \nAdministration,  and  affected  forest  bureaus  and  HPCD  have  obtained  the  forest  land  using \napproval documents. Any income lost from temporary occupation of land will also be paid in cash \nto the owner or user at a rate of two times the AAOV. As soon as the construction is completed, \nthe land will be returned to the users and restored to its original form. Housing compensation will \nbe based on the housing area, construction materials, and market prices for replacement value. \n\nland  allocation  per  capita \n\nlocal  governments  and \n\nto  maintain \n\n                                                        \n1  ADB. 1995. ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 20 \n\n59\n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation   \n\nThere will be no deduction for depreciation, and owners will be allowed to salvage materials from \ntheir old houses. Relocation will provide an opportunity to improve current housing conditions. \nThe households will also receive a transfer and transportation allowance. These households will \nbe  relocated  to  another  site  within  their  original  village.  All  infrastructures,  facilities,  and  other \nassets  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  rates,  without  any  deduction  for  depreciation,  to \nallow full reconstruction by the owners. For land acquisition, the land compensation will be paid \nto  the  affected  village  committee  and  the  resettlement  subsidy  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \nhouseholds.  Compensation  for  standing  crops,  auxiliaries,  and  other  assets  will  also  be  paid \ndirectly to affected farmers. For enterprises, compensation will be paid to owners. The payment \nwill be made in cash according to the appraised value of the property. Income losses resulting \nfrom reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe resettlement strategy encompasses the restoration of livelihoods and income. Since \nthe impacts are widely dispersed among affected villages and per capita of land holding is higher \nthan in other parts of the country, the actual losses will not be significant and land loss impacts \ncould be mitigated and replaced. Therefore, all affected people will remain in agriculture. They \nwill either be provided with replacement land from the village reserve land or cash compensation. \nAgricultural  measures  will  include  developing  new  farmland,  improving  irrigation  works, \nupgrading  low-yielding  farmland,  and  provision  of  training  in  agricultural  technology.  Income \ngeneration activities such as forestry, horticulture, livestock, and sideline businesses will also be \ndeveloped to restore incomes and livelihoods for the relocated people. Affected people will be \ngiven special preference for jobs during construction and operation. HPCD and relevant county \noffices will proactively coordinate with local labor bureaus, employment centers, and enterprises \nto identify job and businesses opportunities for affected people who seek off-farm employment. \nHPCD will help the resettlers gain information and contacts regarding such opportunities. This \nassistance  will  be  especially  important  for  agricultural  households  seeking  to  diversify  their \neconomy through nonagricultural means. All the workers will still work in the same factory after \nthe relocation. \n \n6. \nSome 659 poor households have been identified as affected by the Project. To ensure \ntheir  maximum  protection  during  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  process,  the  following \nprovisions are made: (i) they will be given priority for jobs with the Project; (ii) if they are to be \nrelocated, assistance will be provided by the village committee and local government for house \nconstruction;  (iii)  incorporation  of  their  needs  and  interests  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  will  be  ensured  through  consultation  and  participation  programs.  During \nresettlement, the project implementation unit (PIU) will pay particular attention to the difficulties \nand  needs  of  women  and  women-headed  households  and  will  formulate  and  implement \nprograms through regular consultations with women. The programs will include the following: (i) \nwomen  will  be  given  high  priority  for  project  jobs;  and  (ii)  special  financial  incentives  will  be \nprovided  for  new  small  enterprises  developed  by  women  from  the  affected  households, \naccording to the preferential policies of local governments. The Project will have no significant \nadverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  There  will  be  partial  loss  of  farmland  for  329  minority \nhouseholds,  mostly  Chaoxian.  Besides  the  standard  compensation  entitlements,  special \nassistance  in  economic  rehabilitation  and  career  training  will  be  provided  to  ensure  adequate \nrestoration. If any ethnic minority households are displaced, they will be relocated in their original \nvillages. The Chaoxian villages are supportive of the Project because it will increase business \ninvestment. \n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 20 \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe cost for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY313 million, including contingencies, \ntaxes,  and  fees  for  resettlement  administration.  According  to  the  compensation  policies  and \nstandards defined in the resettlement plan, the payment and usage of compensation funds will \nbe carried out under the supervision of the internal monitoring agencies, with regular reviews by \nthe external monitoring agency. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, \nenterprise,  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  village \ncommittees, households and enterprises. \n \nD. \n \nThe  affected  people  have  been  notified  and  consulted  on  the  key  elements  of  the \n8. \nresettlement  plan.  On  various  occasions  during  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public \nconsultation workshops, and community consultation, local representatives have participated in \nthe  planning  and  their  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement information booklet was disseminated to affected households and village offices in \nFebruary  2006.  The  information  booklet  contains  the  resettlement  scope,  project  schedule, \ncompensation rates for land and other assets, relocation and economic rehabilitation strategies, \nand grievance redress mechanisms. When grievances arise, the affected people may submit an \noral or written complaint first to the village committee. If the village cannot solve the issue, it can \nbe taken to the township government. If the grievance is still unresolved, they can seek redress \nat  the  county  land  administration  bureau.  The  appeal  must  be  replied  within  2  weeks.  If  any \naffected person is not satisfied or if the complaint is serious, the PIU will try to solve the problem. \nIf the grievance is still not resolved satisfactorily, as a last resort, final redress may be sought in \nthe civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedure Act. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  PIU\u2019s  project  resettlement  office  will  coordinate  the  planning,  implementation, \ninternal monitoring and supervision, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. \nCounty land administration bureaus will be responsible for implementing the resettlement plan. \nThey will work closely with township and village resettlement offices or forest stations, which will \nbe responsible for delivering entitlements, selecting new housing sites, monitoring development \nof  replacement  land,  and  implementing  economic  rehabilitation  measures  among  affected \nvillages. HPCD and local land bureaus will take full responsibility for the internal monitoring to \nensure  that  the  project  complies  with  requirements  described  in  the  resettlement  plan.  An \nindependent monitoring agency will be engaged by HPCD to undertake resettlement monitoring \nand evaluation for the Project. External monitoring will be undertaken biannually and reported to \nADB  and  HPCD.  Once  resettlement  activities  are  completed,  annual  tracer  surveys  will  be \nconducted to evaluate livelihoods and incomes compared with the baseline survey results. The \nreports will provide information regarding whether resettlement objectives have been achieved \nand the relocated families have achieved equal or better livelihoods and living standards. HPCD \nwill  engage  the  external  monitor  by  June  2006.  Resettlement  implementation  is  scheduled  to \nprecede the project construction schedules. Land acquisition activities are planned to commence \nin August 2006. Relocation of displaced houses will be completed before road construction.   \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Schedule \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 26 June 2006) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1250 \nCNY8.0002 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEIA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nFYP \nGDP \nHEPB \nHPCD \nHPG \nLIBOR \nMOC \nNTNDP \nO&M \nPAM \nPCR \nPPMS \nPRC \nTA \nVOC \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfive-year plan \ngross domestic product \nHeilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau \nHeilongjiang Provincial Communications Department  \nHeilongjiang provincial government \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Communications \nnortheast regional transport network development plan \noperation and maintenance \nproject administration memorandum \nproject completion report  \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \n \nNOTES \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \nThe exchange rate of the yuan is determined under a floating exchange rate \nsystem.
