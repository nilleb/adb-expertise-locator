In  total,  the  programs \naim to improve the reliability and stability of the country\u2019s electricity transmission and distribution \nsystems,  and  enable  the  expansion  of  power  generation  capacity  as  envisioned  in  PLN\u2019s \nElectricity  Power  Supply  Business  Plan  (RUPTL),  2015\u20132024.  The  program  also  addresses  a \nkey  priority  of  the  government\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2015\u2013\n2019 to expand nationwide access to affordable and reliable supplies of electricity. It builds on \nADB\u2019s extensive experience in Indonesia\u2019s power subsector.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3.\n \nIndonesia\u2019s gross domestic product growth averaged 5.8% during 2010\u20132014; per capita \nincome  was  $3,492  in  2014.  During  2015\u20132019,  the  government  seeks  to  significantly \naccelerate economic growth to reduce income inequality and reduce poverty.2 It has prioritized \ninfrastructure development, especially for the power subsector, as a key measure that will help \nfoster  improved  connectivity  and  promote  inclusive  growth  to  increase  incomes  and  reduce \npoverty. \n \n4.\nExpansion  in  the  power  subsector  has  not  kept  up  with  increased  power  demand  and \n \nsince 2010, demand has averaged about 8%. Generation capacity additions have been delayed, \nand  underinvestment  and  infrastructure  deficits  extend  to  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems.  Power  system  stability  and  reliability  indexes  indicate  deteriorating  trends,  and \nSumatra and Java recently experienced blackouts. All of this severely constrains the country\u2019s \nability to provide for growth in industrial and commercial power demand. Indonesia continues to \nlag its regional peers in terms of access to electricity for its citizens. Increasing the electrification \nrate  from  the  current  84%  to  nearly  universal  coverage  will  require  substantial  investment  in \ntransmission and distribution systems, along with associated generation capacity. \n \n5.\n \nThe government recognizes that business-as-usual will not lead to increased access to \nreliable  and  cost-effective  supplies  of  electricity.  PLN,  a  vertically  integrated  utility,  dominates \nthe country\u2019s power subsector. It owns and manages almost 75% of the total power generation; \nthe remainder is owned and managed by independent power producers and captive generation. \nPLN  owns  and  operates  about  39,900  circuit-kilometers  (ckm)  of  transmission  lines,  and \n925,300 ckm of distribution lines. PLN, under the guidance of the government, has outlined an \naggressive  expansion  program  for  power.  Its  latest  power  development  plan  (RUPTL,  2015\u2013\n2024)  estimates  that  an  additional  70  gigawatts  (GW)  of  new  generation  capacity  is  required. \nPLN  and  the  government  are  to  finance  at  least  21  GW  of  the  new  generation,  and  the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In 2014, about 11.3% of the population was considered to be living below the poverty line. \n\n\fassociated transmission and distribution infrastructure; the private sector is expected to develop \nabout 36 GW.3 The expansion includes 60,000 ckm of new transmission lines and 304,000 ckm \nof  distribution  lines,  along  with  grid  rehabilitation  and  strengthening.  The  overall  2015\u20122024 \nexpansion program is expected to cost $132 billion. \n \n6. \nIn  the  medium-term,  during  the  first  5  years  of  the  RUPTL,  2015\u20132024  and  during  the \nterm  of  the  RPJMN,  2015\u20122019,  PLN  plans  to  install  42  GW  of  the  70  GW  to  achieve  an \nelectrification  ratio  of  97.4%. 4  This  medium-term  program  requires  $83.1  billion,  of  which  \n$43.0 billion is to be financed by independent power producers. PLN is to finance the balance of \n$40.1  billion,  including  $15.6  billion  for  generation  and  $24.5  billion  for  electricity  grid \nrehabilitation  and  strengthening,  and  the  development  of  new  transmission  and  distribution \ninfrastructure.  PLN\u2019s  current  estimates  put  the  financing  gap  at  $30  billion  for  the  5-year \nprogram. \n \n7. \nThe  government  has  taken  several  measures  to  strengthen  PLN\u2019s  ability  to  undertake \nthis  planned expansion, and to  improve the  investment  climate for  the  private  sector.  In  2014, \nthe government increased electricity tariffs, and in 2015 instituted tariffs based on cost recovery \nand  automatic  price  adjustment  for  all  but  the  poorest  households.  Further,  in  2015  it  is \nproviding nearly $500 million in equity injections to PLN, and budgeted $1 billion for 2016. It is \nalso seeking to move away from regulating PLN on a cost-plus-margin-based approach to one \nbased on performance. This is intended to improve PLN\u2019s financial status and its ability to raise \ndebt.  The  government  recently  passed  regulations  that  will  allow  PLN  to  borrow  directly  from \nbilateral and multilateral agencies against a sovereign-backed guarantee. \n  \nB. \n \n8. \nDuring  2015\u20122024,  the  nationwide  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  will \nrequire an estimated $35 billion in public funding channeled through PLN. A significant portion \nof  this  investment  will  focus  on  reconductoring  existing  transmission  lines  to  improve  capacity \nand efficiency, expansion and reinforcement of medium-voltage and low-voltage networks, and \nexpansion of customer connections. This expansion is best implemented using a programmatic \napproach  involving  standardized  equipment  and  bulk  procurement,  wherein  implementation \nplans  and  approaches  used  in  one  context  can  be  replicated  across  regions.  Along  with \ninvestments  in  new  high-voltage  transmission  lines,  these  investments  will  help  transmit  and \ndistribute  power  from  existing  and  new  power  plants.  It  thus  complements  the  generation  and \nlong-distance  transmission  system  investments  carried  out  by  PLN  and  other  development \npartners. \n \n9. \nPLN has selected the Sumatra region for the proposed investment program. This is well \naligned with the government\u2019s vision for the region to make an increasingly larger contribution to \nthe country\u2019s gross domestic product and become the next industrial center after Java. Sumatra \nhas an electrification ratio of 84.5% and a population of 54 million, of which 9 million do not have \naccess  to  electricity.  PLN  estimates  that  Sumatra  requires  at  least  $21  billion  in  investments \nduring  2015\u20122019 for generation, transmission, and distribution.  By  2019,  PLN  is  targeting  an \nadditional  9  GW  of  generation,  total  installed  generation  capacity  of  15  GW,  and  2.85  million \nnew  customers  connected.  A  focus  on  Sumatra  sets  the  stage  for  achieving  the  objectives  of \nthe RUPTL, 2015\u20122024 and the RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n                                                \n3  About 13.5 GW of the new generation is classified as \u201cunallocated.\u201d \n4  This includes about 7 GW of capacity that is currently under construction. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s results-based lending (RBL) is the most appropriate modality for supporting PLN\u2019s \n10. \nelectricity  grid  strengthening  program,  starting  with  Sumatra.  Strengthening  the  electricity  grid \ninvolves many relatively small-scale, discrete activities and expenditures. This is best supported \nusing  the  RBL  approach,  where  the  focus  is  not  on  inputs  but  on  delivery  of  specific  and \nmeasurable  results  through  effective  strategic  planning,  systems  strengthening,  optimal \nresource  allocation,  systematic  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  It  also \nhelps lower transaction costs for PLN, and helps ADB to rely on and strengthen PLN practices, \nsystems,  and \nthe  RBL  approach  encourages  other \ndevelopment partners to join the program. The World Bank will provide financing of $500 million \nfor  Sumatra  using  its  program-for-results  modality,  which  is  similar  to  the  RBL.  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  have  coordinated  their  due  diligence  assessments  and  have  harmonized  key \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) to support a common results framework for the program. \n\ninstitutional  capacity.  Moreover, \n\n \n11. \nThe program is part of a larger medium-term package of ADB support for strengthening \nIndonesia\u2019s electricity grid. RBLs are planned for Java\u2013Bali and the Eastern Indonesia regions \nin  2016\u20132019.  Further,  the  program  complements  the  broader  policy  reform  support  being \nprovided  by  the  policy-based  loan  series\u2014Sustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program\u2014\ncomprising three subprograms during 2015\u20122019, and strategic project investments in gas-fired \npower  generation  and  renewable  energy  power  plants  being  planned  during  the  same  period. \nThe program  is  included  in ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017 for Indonesia \nand aligned with the priorities outlined in the interim country partnership strategy, 2015.5 Overall, \nADB  is  seeking  to  provide  nearly  $4  billion  in  financing  to  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  sector  during \n2015\u20132019. \n \nThe  program  design  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  4  decades  of  experience  in \n12. \nIndonesia\u2019s energy sector. It allows for larger, flexible, and programmatic financing for the sector \nwith  an  emphasis  on  results.  This  approach  provides  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  collaborate \nwith  a  large  utility  in  a  middle-income  country,  and  use  its  financing  leverage  to  improve  the \neffectiveness and efficiency of PLN\u2019s entire electricity grid strengthening program, which will be \nrolled out during 2015\u20132024. The RBL approach will enhance the predictability and amount of \nsector financing, helping to attract additional financing from other development partners. \n \nC. \n \n13. \n2015\u20132019.

The outcome \nwill be the achievement of an adequate and reliable power supply for Sumatra. The outputs are \nselected  from  PLN\u2019s  key  performance  indicators.  A  total  of  three  outcome  and  three  output \ntargets have been developed into annual DLIs; their achievement will set the progressive steps \nto meeting the overall program outcome target. Two financing of prior results process indicators \nfocusing  on  PLN\u2019s  procurement  system  and  contract  implementation  strengthening  are  also \nincluded and linked to disbursement in the preparatory phases of the program. The results chain \nincludes  some  targets  articulating  the  RBL  program\u2019s  outcome,  which  are  difficult  to  link  to \ndisbursements and therefore are included in the program action plan (PAP).7 The program has \nthree results areas. \n \n\n(i)  Results  area  1:  Existing  transmission  system  strengthened  and  expanded. \nOutput  1  will  contribute  to  PLN\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  and  expand  the  existing \ntransmission  system  (DLI  4  and  PAPs  1,  2,  5,  and  7)  including  reconductoring  of \nexisting  150  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines,  extension  of  150  kV  and  275  kV \nsubstations,  installation  of  150  kV  and  275  kV  reactors  and  capacitors,  and \nexpansion  of  outgoing  20  kV  switchgears  at  existing  150  kV  substations.  This \nresults  area  addresses  PLN\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  system  resiliency  and  regional \nreliability across Sumatra with a stronger transmission system. \n\n \n(ii)  Results  area  2:  Existing  distribution  system  strengthened  and  expanded. \nOutput  2  will  contribute  to  PLN  programs  to  expand  and  reinforce  the  medium-\nvoltage \ninstall  distribution \ntransformers,  install  service  connections  and  feeders,  and  install  customer  meter \nboxes and circuit breakers (DLIs 5 and 6, and PAPs 4, 6, and 7).

The  program  will  contribute  to  (i)  improving  quality  and  reliability  by \nreducing  average  customer  downtime;  (ii)  addressing  annual  peak  load  increase  of  9%;  \n(iii)  rehabilitating  and  building  at  least  19,300  ckm  of  transmission  and  37,500  ckm  of  new \ndistribution lines; (iv) increasing energy sales to 47,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh); and (v) reducing \n                                                \n10 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined outstanding balance \n\nof advance financing and amount of financing for prior results should not exceed 30%. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fProgram System Assessments \n\ndistribution  losses from 11.94%  in 2014  to  less  than  10.00%  by  2019. These  targets  underpin \nthe  program  results  areas,  key  actions to  be  taken,  and  performance  indicators  for  the  sector \noverall and the proposed program in particular.  \n \nThe  program  will  also  generate  incremental  benefits  accrued  from  the  additional \n25. \nelectricity supply due to the strengthened and expanded transmission and distribution capacity. \nDuring 2015\u20132019, a 9 GW increase in grid capacity will deliver incremental energy sales of at \nleast  4,300  GWh  within  4  years  of  start-up  of  operations.  The  economic  analysis  yields  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 15.7%, confirming the program\u2019s economic viability.11 \n \nB. \n \n26.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  PLN\u2019s  corporate  M&E  system  is  handled  and \nmanaged  by  its  Corporate  Performance  Control  Unit  using  its  Management  Reporting \nInformation  System,  which  will  also  verify  the  DLIs.12 The  Management  Reporting  Information \nSystem contains data on critical dimensions such as performance, electricity generation, energy \nsales,  transmission  and  distribution,  and  projects  and  construction.  It  provides  accurate  real-\ntime  online  data.  To  implement  the  M&E  requirements,  each  department  operates  information \ntechnology applications that are developed together with PLN\u2019s Information Technology Division. \nThese applications generate data and provide information on current activities and for the M&E \nprocess  for  PLN  management  and  board  of  directors.13 A  monthly  summary  report  provides \ncomprehensive  data  in  real  time  on  customer  service  quality,  project  performance,  corporate \nperformance,  and  electricity  conditions.  If  needed,  independent  monitoring  by  ADB  can \nsupplement this information. \n \n27. \nFiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  These  systems  were  assessed  to  determine \ntheir  ability  to  manage  fiduciary  risks  and  provide  assurance  that  RBL  program  funds  will  be \nused  for  the  intended  purposes,  with  due  consideration  for  economy  and  efficiency. 14 The \nassessments found that improvements are needed in planning and budgeting, and that further \ncomputerization  is  required  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting.  This  will  be  covered  by \nactivities under the PAP. \n \n28. \nThe procurement assessment covered the procurement profile, procurement regulations, \nrules,  procedures  and  arrangements,  agency  organizational  capacity  and  arrangements,  and \nprocurement  system  performance. 15 The  program  will  rely  on  PLN  procurement  systems  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  RBL  policy. 16  The  assessment  notes  that  the  overall  procurement \nframework,  as  expressed in  PLN guidelines for procurement,  is  robust  as  it follows  many  best \npractices  used  by  utility  companies  around  the  world.  PLN  will  use  a  variety  of  procurement \nmethods,  which  include  open  competitive  bidding,  framework  contracts,  and  direct  contracting \nthrough  open  book. 17 The  procurement  of  large  transformers  is  excluded  from  the  RBL  as \ncontracts average more than $30 million, the limit for goods contracts in ADB\u2019s RBL policy.

Jakarta. \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\fassessment  identifies  two  key  issues  for  ADB  to  consider  when  implementing  an  RBL  using \nPLN\u2019s  procurement  system:  local  content  requirements  and  direct  contracting  through  open \nbook.  Both  are  integral  parts  of  PLN\u2019s  efforts  to  deliver  value-for-money  in  the  procurement \nprocess.  A  procurement  monitoring  framework  to  strengthen  PLN\u2019s  procurement  system  has \nbeen developed for this program. \n \n29. \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with PLN (footnote 16). \n \n30. \nSafeguard  systems.  A  program  safeguard  system  assessment  confirms  safeguard \ncategorizations  of  B  for  environment,  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.18 Potential construction-related impacts include disturbance of vegetation, soil erosion, \nsedimentation,  noise,  dust,  vibration,  and  generation  of  waste.  Potential  impacts  during \noperation include trimming of trees within the right-of-way of transmission and distribution lines. \nThe program impacts are site-specific, and can be mitigated and/or managed by PLN's current \npractices. The program\u2019s activities that relate to extension of substations, installation of reactors \nand  capacitors,  and  expansion  of  switchgears  will  take  place  in  the  existing  substations\u2019 \npremises  owned  and  managed  by  PLN.  They  will  not  require  any  involuntary  resettlement. \nExpansion  of  the  distribution  network  (including  installation  of  distribution  transformers)  will \nrequire (i) use of no more than 0.2 square meters of land for installation of concrete poles, and \n(ii)  possible  removal  of  nonland  assets  (primarily  trees)  for  stringing  of  conductors.  Although \nSumatra  is  inhabited  by  a  variety  of  ethnic  groups,  the  program  will  not  be  in  areas  where \nindigenous peoples are present. Gaps identified by the assessment include weak management \nof  industrial  waste  and  the  procedure  for  negotiated  settlements  or  voluntary  donation,  which \nare addressed in the PAP. \n \nC. \n \n31.  Major  risks  and  mitigating measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.19 The  overall  benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nRatings \n\nKey Mitigating Measures \n\nto \n\nInadequate \nResults. \ninstitutional  capacity  could  be  a \nprogram\u2019s \nbarrier \nthe \nprogress \nfew  PLN \nsince \nprojects are completed on time. \nExpenditure  and \nfinancing. \nPLN may not be able to meet its \nown funding targets. \n\nFiduciary.

The DLI is scalable \nand partial disbursement is allowed: if the \nminimum threshold is not met, then \ndisbursement can be proportional to the \nincrease made (e.g., 2% increase in \ncustomers means 67% disbursement for that \nyear). Disbursements are allowed for early or \nlate achievement of the DLI. This means that \nthe planned disbursement amount for a given \nyear can be released when the set target is \nfully achieved even if the achievement is a \nyear late, as long as the achievement is \nduring the program\u2019s duration. \nDefinition of DLI 2 is energy sales by PLN in \nGWh for the whole of Sumatra which is the \nelectricity sold to residential customers by \nPLN. \nConditions for disbursement are met if, \nstarting from the actual residential energy \nsales in 2014 (15,850 GWh), the sales each \nyear is at least 3% more than the preceding \nyear.
