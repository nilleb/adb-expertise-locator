It  will  transform  the  corridor  towns  of  Battambang,  Bavet,  Neak  Loeung,  and \nPoipet  in  Cambodia  into  economic  hubs  by  improving  urban  environmental  infrastructure  and \nstrengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and  local  authorities.  The  project  will \nincrease  climate  resilience  by  supporting  flood  control  measures  that  will  significantly  improve \nthe productivity of economic enterprises in the towns. It will provide environmental infrastructure \nfor  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  management  with  benefits  including  reducing  the \ncarbon footprint of the towns, making them cleaner and greener, and more livable.  The project \nwill upgrade urban roads to enhance mobility. It will finance 10 subprojects in the towns.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic  economic  development.  Considerable  investments  by  the  government  and \nthe  Asian  Development Bank (ADB)  in  developing  priority  transport  corridors  have  established \nphysical  connectivity  between  the  GMS  countries  and  allowed  for  more  efficient  movement  of \npeople,  goods,  and  services.  The  towns  and cities  along the  SEC,  which  links  Cambodia  and \nViet  Nam,  are  positioned  to  serve  as  dynamic  centers  of  investment  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth for  the  country  and  the  GMS.  The  strategic  location  of  the  corridor  towns  provides  the \nstimulus  for  increased  trade  and  investment  along  the  transport  routes.  Amid  these \ndevelopment  opportunities,  the  rapid  growth  of  the  urban  population,  and  expansion  of  urban \nareas,  several  corridor  towns  are  now  faced  with  the  task  of  meeting  the  demands  for  urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services.  \n \n4. \nThe  planned  development  of  the  towns  will  induce  more  regulated  and  sustainable \ngrowth  by  attracting  public  sector  investment  in  urban  environmental  infrastructure  and \nencouraging private sector interest in urban economic infrastructure. The project will strengthen \nthe economic competitiveness and investment attractiveness of the towns.  Small and medium-\nsized  towns  are  crucial  in  terms  of  their  roles  as  markets  and  transport  hubs  for  agricultural \nproduce  from  rural  areas,  as  well  as  centers  for  production  and  distribution  of  goods  and \nservices to urban areas. \n \n5. \nThe project is one of three projects for GMS corridor towns; the other two will be in the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  and  Viet  Nam. 4  The  project  is  phase  1  of  a  long-term \nengagement  with  towns  of  the  GMS  economic  corridors,  and  is  aligned  with  the  strategic \nframework  of  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  2012\u20132022,  approved  by  the  Fourth \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  Contributor: the Government of Sweden.  \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB  provided project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Greater  Mekong \n\nSubregion for Preparing the Corridor Towns Development Project. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nProject  towns.  Four  corridor  towns  along  the  SEC  were  selected  as  project  areas \n\nGMS  Summit  on  19\u201320  December  2011.  It  is  also  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy, \n2011\u20132013  for  Cambodia,5 and  supports  ADB\u2019s  urban  operational  plan  (2012\u20132020)6 and  water \noperational plan (2011\u20132020).7 \n \nThe  participating  corridor  towns  in  Cambodia  now  must  meet  the  demands  of  rapidly \n6. \ngrowing and expanding urban areas. The goal of local authorities is to plan and manage urban \ngrowth using an integrated approach, operate and maintain urban environmental and economic \ninfrastructure,  and  efficiently  deliver  municipal  services.  Despite  policy  reforms  to  promote \ndecentralization,  local  institutional  capacity  has  not  kept  pace  with  urban  sector  development \nand economic growth. With increasing trade and traffic flow, the capacity of the corridor towns to \nmanage  local  economic  development  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner  needs  to  be \nstrengthened.  \n \n7. \nbased on their economic potential, infrastructure constraints, and expressed commitment.  \n \nBattambang  is  a  traditional  agricultural  trading  center.  This  market  town,  with  a \n8. \npopulation  of  143,000  in  2010,  has  the  potential  to  be  transformed  into  an  agro-industrial  hub \nand  tourism  destination  given  its  strategic  location  in West  Cambodia,  close  to  the  Tonle  Sap \nand  the  Thailand  border.  It  can  become  an  attractive  town  for  increased  trade,  economic \nactivities, and tourism through investments in urban infrastructure and capacity development. \n \n9. \nBavet  is  strategically  located  at  the  border  crossing  between Cambodia and Viet  Nam. \nSince  its  establishment  as  a  new  town  in  2008,  Bavet\u2014a  town  of  37,000  (in  2010)\u2014has \nbecome  the  prime  destination  for  large  manufacturers  as  well  as  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises operating from newly established export processing zones. The increasing number \nof industry locators has caused an influx of migrants working in the export processing zones or \nseeking  employment  opportunities.  As  a  border  town,  Bavet  has  benefitted  from  private \ninvestment  in  casino  and  recreational  establishments  that  have  stimulated  growth.  The  town \naims to become a dynamic regional industrial and manufacturing hub.  \n  \n10. \nNeak  Loeung  is  also  a  traditional  agricultural  trading  area  and  a  market  town  at  the \nintersection  of  the  SEC  and  the  Mekong  River.  Currently  under  construction,  the  second \nMekong  River  Friendship  Bridge  (to  be  completed  in  2014)  will  improve  linkages  with  other \ntowns  and  cities  along  the  SEC.  With  the  new  bridge,  Neak  Loeung,  a  town  of  25,000 \ninhabitants (in 2008), intends to develop into an agro-industrial and trading center.  \n \nPoipet  is  an  important  border  town  situated  at  the  border  with  Thailand.  Its  strategic \n11. \nlocation  has  stimulated  economic  activities  in  the  town  center  with  several  recreation  and \ngaming establishments, hotels and restaurants, as well as banks and money exchange shops. \nSince the opening of cross-border trade in 1993, the town of 84,000 (in 2010) has emerged as a \ntourism  destination  and potential  site for  industrial  development  in  its  export  processing  zone. \nRapid growth is due to in-migration from neighboring towns propelled by economic opportunities.  \n \n12. \nRelated policies and strategies. The project will support the sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment  of  Cambodia\u2019s  urban  centers.  This  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  National \nStrategic Development Plan, which supports efforts to promote balanced regional distribution of \nstrategically  located  small  and  medium-sized  towns.  ADB  will  integrate  its  urban  interventions \nwith  other  priority  areas,  particularly  agriculture  and  natural  resources  development,  climate \n\n                                                \n5   ADB. 2011.

The  required  integration  of  urban  sector \nneeds may be achieved by defining mutually reinforcing objectives (footnote 5).  \n \n13. \nADB  leadership.  ADB  will  provide  leadership  for  urban  sector  development  with  an \ninnovative  urban  strategy  relevant  for  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  It  will \nprimarily  have  multisector  interventions  that  incorporate  rural\u2013urban  linkages.  Implementation \nwill  emphasize  cooperation  with  other  development  partners  as  well  as  collaboration  among \nlocal governments and the private sector. The government strategy is reflected in ADB\u2019s urban \nsector assessment, strategy, and road map, 2011 for Cambodia.8 \n \n14. \nLessons.  Important  lessons from  official  development  assistance  and  ADB  experience \nin urban development include the need to (i) strengthen institutional capacity and skills in project \nimplementation  and  management  as  part  of  project  start-up  activities;  (ii)  provide  support  for \nproject  management,  financial  management,  and  procurement  procedures;  (iii) reduce  time  to \nfinalize  design and  bidding documents; (iv)  implement  advance action for  land acquisition  and \nresettlement; and (v) develop project coordination mechanisms and networking with government \nagencies and private sector groups.9 These are included in the project design. Experience from \nwastewater treatment in Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, under ADB\u2019s GMS Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment  Project, 10 will  be  very  valuable  in  designing  a  sustainable  mechanism  for  the \noperation and maintenance of revenue-earning subprojects, such as wastewater treatment and \nsolid waste management. \n \n15. \nSpecial  features.  The  project  (i)  supports  regional  development  in  the  GMS  (and \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  by  creating  growth  engines  in  corridor  towns;  \n(ii)  supports  climate  resilience  of  towns  through  adaptation  initiatives  to  reduce  the  adverse \nimpact  of  climate  risk  on  infrastructure  investment,  with  cofinancing  from  the  ADB  Strategic \nClimate  Fund  under  its  Pilot  Program  for  Climate  Resilience;  (iii)  pursues  recycling  of  solid \nwaste through the innovative materials recovery facilities for waste segregation, with cofinancing \nfrom  the  Urban  Environmental  Infrastructure  Fund  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership \nFacility;  and  (iv)  supports  decentralization through  capacity  development of  local  authorities  to \nensure the sustainability of subprojects.11 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe  impact  will  be  the  development  of  the  project  towns  of  Battambang,  Bavet,  Neak \nLoeung, and Poipet to become centers of economic activity in the SEC, thereby contributing to \nthe  transformation  of  transport  and  economic  corridors  within  the  GMS.  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved urban infrastructure and enhanced climate resilience in the project towns. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  adoption  and  implementation  of  strategic  local  economic \n17. \ndevelopment  plans  in  the  project  towns,  (ii)  implementation  of  priority  urban  infrastructure \ninvestments (including climate resilience measures), and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity. \nThe  priority  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  criteria  such  as  (i) consistency  with  the \n                                                \n8   ADB. 2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n24. \nThe  project  involves  the  construction  of  urban  and  flood  protection  infrastructure;  and \nimprovement  of existing urban  roads,  and  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  management \nfacilities. The technology for  undertaking  the  civil  works  is  within the  capacity  of  the  provincial \noffices and district authorities. The technical and engineering designs, including the O&M plan, \nare  based  on  standard  parameters  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  Technical  specifications \nhave  been  identified  for  the  climate  resilience  of  the  five  subprojects  supported  by  the  ADB \nSCF.14 \n  \n25. \nThe  national  government  introduced  the  Organic  Law  on  the  Management  and \nAdministration  of  Province,  Municipality,  and  District  as  a  new  system  of  governance  that  is \nintended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of local government services. The strategic \ngoals  of  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  process  are to  strengthen  and  expand  local \ngovernance, promote local economic development, and reduce poverty in the countryside. Local \nauthorities,  however,  do  not  have  adequate  institutional  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  urban \n\n                                                \n14  Climate Resilience Measures (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nsector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban  infrastructure,  and  deliver  essential  urban \nservices.  The  project  will  provide  capacity  development  and  training  support  in  line  with  the \ndecentralization and deconcentration program. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  all  subprojects.  In  undertaking  the  cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis,  the  quantification  of  economic  benefits  depended  on  the  nature  of  the  subproject. \nBenefits  that  were quantified  included savings  in  vehicle operating cost  and travel  time for  the \nroad subproject. Quantifiable economic benefits from the drainage and flood control subprojects \ninclude health benefits, reduction of flood damage, and improvement in economic productivity; \neconomic  efficiency  of  recovering  recyclable  wastes  and  reduction  in  costs  of  disposal  for  the \nmaterials recovery facilities; and willingness to pay for the wastewater system and solid waste \nmanagement. The  expected  beneficiaries  of  the  overall  project  constitute  a  diverse  group  that \nincludes road users, business establishments, tourism service providers, property owners, and \nhouseholds.  The  base  case  results  indicate  all  components  are  economically  viable  with  an \nestimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  ranging  from  12%  to  30%,  which  exceeds  the \nassumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Except  for  the  Neak  Loeung  flood \nprotection  subproject  where  two  of  the  sensitivity  tests  were  below  12%,  all  the  other \nsubprojects are viable under adverse scenarios in which costs are higher and/or benefits lower \nby 10% than the base case.15 \n \n27. \nFor  the  three  towns  with  urban  road  subprojects,  the  provincial  authority  has  to \nprovide funds to  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  through  annual \nbudgetary  allocations to  cover  the  required  O&M  costs  and  ensure  project  sustainability.  The \nfinancial analysis focuses on historical annual budget allocations to the  provincial departments \nof  public  works  and  transport. The  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  materials \nrecovery  facility,  and  Mekong  River  embankment  protection  subprojects  are  considered \nrevenue-generating,  thus  financial  internal  rates  of  return  were  computed  taking  into \nconsideration  the  fees  or  income  that  can  be  generated  from  their  operation.  The  financial \ninternal rates of return range from 4.2% to 7.3%, all higher than the computed weighted average \ncost of capital.16  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nAn  assessment  of  the  financial  management  and  fund  disbursement  system,  and \nprocurement  capacity  indicates  that  MPWT  adheres  to  the  transparency  and  accountability \nelements of good governance. Through direct participation and involvement in the procurement \nprocedures  of  ADB-financed  projects,  MPWT developed  the  institutional capacity  to  undertake \ninternational  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works.  However,  given  the  limited \nexperience  of  the  provincial  and  district  authorities  in  projects  funded  by  official  development \nassistance, the project will be implemented by MPWT\u2019s project management unit, with support \nfrom  its  provincial  offices.  Capacity  development  assistance  will  provide  training  on  financial \nmanagement,  fund  disbursement,  and  harmonized  procurement  guidelines  of  the  government \nand ADB. A good governance framework is attached to the project administration manual.   \n \nD. \n \n29. \nUrban poverty. The proportion of poor in the towns ranges from 11% in Battambang to \n23% in Poipet. The poor mostly live in areas without adequate running water supply, wastewater \n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand  solid  waste  collection  and  treatment  services,  and  roads  and  drainage.  They  often \nexperience  serious  water supply  shortages,  poor  water quality,  wastewater pollution,  and  poor \nurban  environmental  sanitation.  They  have  less  capacity  to  cope  with  the  pollution  and \ndegraded  environments  and,  in  turn,  experience  increased  exposure  and  risks  to  polluted \nsurface  and  groundwater  and  air,  which  compounds  their  poverty  situation.  Through  the \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects,  the  project  will  improve  the  living  environment  and  health \nstatus of urban residents, especially the poor.17  \n \nGender analysis. The subprojects will provide benefits to women as individuals and as \n30. \nhousehold  members.  Street  vending  is  one  of  the  primary  income  sources  for  women. \nUpgrading roads will improve access and mobility, making women\u2019s travel more convenient and \ncomfortable.  Installing  flood  control  structures  and  improving  drainage  and  wastewater \ntreatment  will  decrease  flooding,  thus  reducing  physical  damage  and  exposure  to  waterborne \ninfections  from  the  overflow  of  drains,  which  often  carry  run-off  and  wastewater.  Women  will \nbenefit  from  eliminating  the  need  for  cleanup  that  takes  them  away  from  other  productive \nactivities. This will also reduce exposure to waterborne infections, decreasing the need to care \nfor sick household members and minimizing women\u2019s own exposure.  \n \n31. \nThe project will benefit both women and men. Some of the negative impacts that could \ndisproportionately  affect  women  will  be  addressed  through  measures  included  in  the  gender \naction  plan. 18  The  plan  also  includes  activities  that  will  enhance  benefits  for  women  by \nimplementing training and awareness-raising programs that focus on wastewater, environmental \nsanitation  and  disease,  solid  waste  management  and  recycling,  and  health  education  and \npromotion, including HIV and sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention.  \n \n32. \nThe  effects  of  involuntary  resettlement  on  women  and  households  headed  by  women, \nand  required  mitigation  are  discussed  in  each  of  the  prepared  resettlement  plans.  The  design \nand monitoring framework includes gender-specific targets, and the key features of the gender \naction plan are incorporated in the framework and the project administration manual.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n  \n33. \nEnvironment (category B). The subprojects are not expected to cause irreversible and \nadverse  environment  impacts.  The  initial  environmental  examinations  conducted  for  all  the \nproject  cities  identified  potential  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  implemented  through \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs). 19  The  initial  environmental  examinations  are  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the applicable environment \nregulations  of  the  government.  They  indicate  that  the  potential  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are \nprimarily construction-related and can be mitigated with good practices in construction outlined \nin the EMPs. At the detailed design stage, when the EMPs are updated and finalized, the final \nreceiving  environments  for  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  landfill  will  be  reviewed  to \nensure that local groundwater and human use of the affected areas are not adversely affected. \nEstimated costs for implementing the EMP are integrated into the project costs. The final EMPs, \ncleared by ADB, will form part of the contract bidding documents. The adequate incorporation of \nenvironmental  considerations  during  design  and  allocation  of  sufficient  budget  for  O&M  will \n\n                                                \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Gender Action Plan (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan \n\nInitial \nEnvironmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Bavet  Subproject;  Initial  Environmental \nExamination:  Environmental  Management  Plan \nInitial  Environmental \nExamination: Environmental Management Plan for Poipet Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n\nfor  Neak  Loeung  Subproject;  and \n\nfor  Battambang  Subproject; \n\n\fmitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  during  operation.  Effective  environmental  monitoring  at  all \nstages  of  subproject  implementation  will  be  ensured.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information \ndisclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the  safeguard  documents  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  was  developed  and  is  included  in  the  safeguard \ndocument to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance.  \n\n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  One  of  the subprojects (flood  control  in Neak \nLoeung) has significant resettlement impacts. Resettlement plans were prepared for each of the \nsubprojects that will trigger land acquisition and resettlement impacts: (i) wastewater treatment \nand flood protection, Battambang; (ii) wastewater treatment, Poipet; and (iii) flood control, Neak \nLoeung. 20  Due  diligence  studies  were  prepared  for  the  seven  subprojects  without  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts:  (i)  flood  control,  Battambang;  (ii)  urban  road,  Bavet; \n(iii) wastewater,  Bavet;  (iv)  solid  waste  management,  Poipet;  (v)  materials  recovery  facility, \nBavet; (vi) materials recovery facility, Poipet; and (vii) materials recovery facility, Battambang. A \ntotal of 12.9 hectares will be acquired and 1,249 households (6,582 people) will be affected by \nthe priority subprojects. Of these, 315 households and 1,671 people represent the subproject of \nNeak  Loeung,  185  households  (787  people)  the  subprojects  in  Poipet,  and  744  households \n(4,091 people) in subproject in Battambang. The flood protection subproject in Neak Loeung will \nhave significant impacts, with 63 affected households (298 affected persons) losing more than \n10% of their productive land. The Battambang flood protection subproject will have five affected \nhouseholds  (33  affected  persons)  requiring  relocation,  while  one  affected  household  (five \naffected  persons)  will  require  relocation  under  the  Poipet  flood  protection  subproject.  All  other \nimpacts  are  partial  and  temporary.  The  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $1.65  million,  which  includes \nbase  costs,  allowances,  and  contingencies.  Project  information  was  disclosed  to  affected \npersons  throughout  project  preparation,  and  a  project  information  booklet  will  be  updated  and \ndistributed  during  a  detailed  measurement  survey.  Resettlement  documents  were  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  local  communities  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nCambodia\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation  requirements,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  help  to  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  regarding  project \nperformance.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  and  disclosed  after  detailed  design  and \ncleared by ADB prior to contract awards.  \n \n35. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  Cambodian  population  comprises  Khmer, \nCham,  Chinese,  Vietnamese,  and  a  smaller  number  of  Lao  and  hill  tribes.  None  of  the  24 \nindigenous  groups  reside  in  the  participating  corridor  towns.  For  all  the  project  towns,  the \nsurveys undertaken for the poverty and social assessments identified that the subproject areas \nare  predominantly  Khmer.  The  beneficiary  communities,  which  include  some  nonindigenous \nminorities, are supportive of the subprojects, as they can see clear and direct benefits for them, \nand understand that the adverse impacts are manageable and can be properly mitigated. The \nsocial  assessment  confirms  that  the  project  is  under  category  C,  which  does  not  require  the \npreparation of an indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF. \n \n36. \nmanagement plan and summarized in Table 5.21 \n\nThe  major  risk  elements  associated  with  the  project  are  presented  in  detail  in  the  risk \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n                                                \n20  Resettlement  Plan:  Battambang  Wastewater  Treatment;  Resettlement  Plan:  Neak  Loeung  Flood  Control;  and \nResettlement Plan: Poipet Wastewater Treatment Plant and Solid Waste Management (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5:  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMajor Risks \nCorridor  towns  are  unable  to  collect  revenues  for \nwastewater  treatment  plants,  sanitary  landfill,  and \nsolid waste management. \n\noperation \n\nMunicipalities  not  yet  fully  prepared  collect  revenues \nfor \nurban \ninfrastructure. \nProcurement and corruption risks do exist. \n\nand  maintenance \n\nof \n\nThe  settlement  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nentitlements is delayed or incomplete. \nQuality  control  and  performance  evaluation \nmunicipalities is lacking.  \n\nin \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nthe  cost \n\nMitigation Measures \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  will  pursue  the \nplanned establishment of local authorities for the collection \nof fees and charges for urban environment infrastructure to \nfor  operation  and  maintenance \nrecover \nexpenditures.   \nThe  project  towns  will  introduce  business  plans  and  cost \nrecovery  instruments  for  revenue  earning  services  (waste \nwater treatment, solid waste management).  \nMass  media  will  be  used  for  bidding  announcements. \nGovernment  and  ADB  procurement  guidelines  will  be \ndisseminated to the project management unit.  \nResettlement  plans  provide  clear  entitlements.
