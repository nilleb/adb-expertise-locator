I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; (ii)  the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate \nFund;1 (iii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate \nFund;  and  (iv)  the  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Urban \nEnvironmental Infrastructure Fund2 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility, all to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Southern Economic Corridor \nTowns Development Project.3  \n \n2.  The project will enhance the competitiveness of towns along the Southern Economic \nCorridor (SEC). It will transform the corridor towns of Battambang, Bavet, Neak Loeung, and \nPoipet in Cambodia into economic hubs by improving urban environmental infrastructure and \nstrengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  provincial  and  local  authorities.  The  project  will \nincrease climate resilience by supporting flood control measures that will significantly improve \nthe productivity of economic enterprises in the towns. It will provide environmental infrastructure \nfor wastewater treatment and solid waste management with benefits including reducing the \ncarbon footprint of the towns, making them cleaner and greener, and more livable. The project \nwill upgrade urban roads to enhance mobility. It will finance 10 subprojects in the towns.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic economic development. Considerable investments by the government and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in developing priority transport corridors have established \nphysical connectivity between the GMS countries and allowed for more efficient movement of \npeople, goods, and services. The towns and cities along the SEC, which links Cambodia and \nViet Nam, are positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and inclusive economic \ngrowth for the country and the GMS. The strategic location of the corridor towns provides the \nstimulus  for  increased  trade  and  investment  along  the  transport  routes.  Amid  these \ndevelopment opportunities, the rapid growth of the urban population, and expansion of urban \nareas, several corridor towns are now faced with the task of meeting the demands for urban \ninfrastructure and essential support services.  \n \n4.  The planned development of the towns will induce more regulated and sustainable \ngrowth  by  attracting  public  sector  investment  in  urban  environmental  infrastructure  and \nencouraging private sector interest in urban economic infrastructure. The project will strengthen \nthe economic competitiveness and investment attractiveness of the towns. Small and medium-\nsized towns are crucial in terms of their roles as markets and transport hubs for agricultural \nproduce from rural areas, as well as centers for production and distribution of goods and \nservices to urban areas. \n \n5.  The project is one of three projects for GMS corridor towns; the other two will be in the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  and  Viet  Nam.4 The  project  is  phase  1  of  a  long-term \nengagement  with  towns  of  the  GMS  economic  corridors,  and  is  aligned  with  the  strategic \nframework of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program, 2012\u20132022, approved by the Fourth \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  Contributor: the Government of Sweden.  \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Greater Mekong \nSubregion for Preparing the Corridor Towns Development Project. Manila.  ", "2 \nGMS Summit on 19\u201320 December 2011. It is also in line with the country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132013 for Cambodia,5 and supports ADB\u2019s urban operational plan (2012\u20132020)6 and water \noperational plan (2011\u20132020).7 \n \n6.  The participating corridor towns in Cambodia now must meet the demands of rapidly \ngrowing and expanding urban areas. The goal of local authorities is to plan and manage urban \ngrowth using an integrated approach, operate and maintain urban environmental and economic \ninfrastructure,  and  efficiently  deliver  municipal  services.  Despite  policy  reforms  to  promote \ndecentralization, local institutional capacity has not kept pace with urban sector development \nand economic growth. With increasing trade and traffic flow, the capacity of the corridor towns to \nmanage local economic development in an environmentally sustainable manner needs to be \nstrengthened.  \n \n7.  Project  towns.  Four corridor towns along the SEC were selected as project areas \nbased on their economic potential, infrastructure constraints, and expressed commitment.  \n \n8.  Battambang  is  a  traditional  agricultural  trading  center.  This  market  town,  with  a \npopulation of 143,000 in 2010, has the potential to be transformed into an agro-industrial hub \nand tourism destination given its strategic location in West Cambodia, close to the Tonle Sap \nand  the Thailand  border.  It can  become  an  attractive  town for  increased  trade,  economic \nactivities, and tourism through investments in urban infrastructure and capacity development. \n \n9.  Bavet is strategically located at the border crossing between Cambodia and Viet Nam. \nSince  its  establishment  as  a  new town  in  2008,  Bavet\u2014a town  of 37,000  (in  2010)\u2014has \nbecome the prime destination for large manufacturers as well as small and medium-sized \nenterprises operating from newly established export processing zones. The increasing number \nof industry locators has caused an influx of migrants working in the export processing zones or \nseeking  employment  opportunities.  As  a  border  town,  Bavet  has  benefitted  from  private \ninvestment in casino and recreational establishments that have stimulated growth. The town \naims to become a dynamic regional industrial and manufacturing hub.  \n  \n10.  Neak Loeung is also a traditional agricultural trading area and a market town at the \nintersection  of  the  SEC  and  the  Mekong  River.  Currently  under  construction,  the  second \nMekong River Friendship Bridge (to be completed in 2014) will improve linkages with other \ntowns  and  cities  along  the  SEC.  With  the  new  bridge,  Neak  Loeung,  a  town  of  25,000 \ninhabitants (in 2008), intends to develop into an agro-industrial and trading center.  \n \n11.  Poipet is an important border town situated at the border with Thailand. Its strategic \nlocation  has  stimulated  economic  activities  in  the  town  center  with  several  recreation  and \ngaming establishments, hotels and restaurants, as well as banks and money exchange shops. \nSince the opening of cross-border trade in 1993, the town of 84,000 (in 2010) has emerged as a \ntourism destination and potential site for industrial development in its export processing zone. \nRapid growth is due to in-migration from neighboring towns propelled by economic opportunities.  \n \n12.  Related policies and strategies. The project will support the sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s urban centers. This is consistent with the government\u2019s National \nStrategic Development Plan, which supports efforts to promote balanced regional distribution of \nstrategically located small and medium-sized towns. ADB will integrate its urban interventions \nwith other priority areas, particularly agriculture and natural resources development, climate \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011.

The required integration of urban sector \nneeds may be achieved by defining mutually reinforcing objectives (footnote 5).  \n \n13.  ADB leadership. ADB will provide leadership for urban sector development with an \ninnovative urban strategy  relevant for economic development and poverty reduction. It will \nprimarily have multisector interventions that incorporate rural\u2013urban linkages. Implementation \nwill emphasize cooperation with other development partners as well as collaboration among \nlocal governments and the private sector. The government strategy is reflected in ADB\u2019s urban \nsector assessment, strategy, and road map, 2011 for Cambodia.8 \n \n14.  Lessons. Important lessons from official development assistance and ADB experience \nin urban development include the need to (i) strengthen institutional capacity and skills in project \nimplementation and management as part of project start-up activities; (ii) provide support for \nproject management, financial management, and procurement procedures; (iii) reduce time to \nfinalize design and bidding documents; (iv) implement advance action for land acquisition and \nresettlement; and (v) develop project coordination mechanisms and networking with government \nagencies and private sector groups.9 These are included in the project design. Experience from \nwastewater treatment in Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, under ADB\u2019s GMS Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment Project,10 will be very valuable in designing a sustainable mechanism for the \noperation and maintenance of revenue-earning subprojects, such as wastewater treatment and \nsolid waste management. \n \n15.  Special  features.  The  project  (i)  supports  regional  development  in  the  GMS  (and \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  by  creating  growth  engines  in  corridor  towns;  \n(ii) supports climate resilience of towns through adaptation initiatives to reduce the adverse \nimpact of climate risk on infrastructure investment, with cofinancing from the ADB Strategic \nClimate Fund under its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience; (iii) pursues recycling of solid \nwaste through the innovative materials recovery facilities for waste segregation, with cofinancing \nfrom  the  Urban  Environmental  Infrastructure  Fund  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership \nFacility; and (iv) supports decentralization through capacity development of local authorities to \nensure the sustainability of subprojects.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be the development of the project towns of Battambang, Bavet, Neak \nLoeung, and Poipet to become centers of economic activity in the SEC, thereby contributing to \nthe transformation of transport and economic corridors within the GMS. The outcome will be \nimproved urban infrastructure and enhanced climate resilience in the project towns. \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  adoption  and  implementation  of  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment  plans  in  the  project  towns,  (ii)  implementation  of  priority  urban  infrastructure \ninvestments (including climate resilience measures), and (iii) strengthened institutional capacity. \nThe  priority  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  criteria  such  as  (i) consistency  with  the \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

The project is estimated to cost $54.78 million equivalent, including taxes, duties, and \nphysical and price contingencies (Table 2).   \n \n19.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR24,023,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsulting services, interest during construction on the ADB loan, and contingencies. \n \n20.  The Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund12 under the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1.5 million, to be administered by ADB. The \ngrant will solely finance three subprojects involving construction of material recovery facilities for \nsolid waste recycling. Of the remaining seven subprojects, five have cofinancing from the ADB \nStrategic Climate Fund (ADB SCF), and two projects solely financed by ADB. The ADB SCF will \nprovide  loan  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $5 million  and grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $4.4 \nmillion, both to be administered by ADB. The ADB SCF loan will have a 40-year term, including \na grace period of 10 years, and a service charge of 0.1% per annum on the disbursed and \noutstanding loan amount. The ADB SCF service charge will be capitalized. About $6.87 million \nequivalent will be provided by the Government of Cambodia through the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance to cover taxes and duties and involuntary resettlement costs. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 3.  \n \n \n                                                \n12  Contributor: the Government of Sweden. \n ", "5 \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n24.  The project involves the construction of urban and flood protection infrastructure; and \nimprovement of existing urban roads, and wastewater treatment and solid waste management \nfacilities. The technology for undertaking the civil works is within the capacity of the provincial \noffices and district authorities. The technical and engineering designs, including the O&M plan, \nare based on standard parameters to ensure long-term sustainability. Technical specifications \nhave been identified for the climate resilience of the five subprojects supported by the ADB \nSCF.14 \n  \n25.  The  national  government  introduced  the  Organic  Law  on  the  Management  and \nAdministration of Province, Municipality, and District as a new system of governance that is \nintended to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of local government services. The strategic \ngoals of the decentralization and deconcentration process are to strengthen and expand local \ngovernance, promote local economic development, and reduce poverty in the countryside. Local \nauthorities, however, do not have adequate institutional capacity to plan and manage urban \n                                                \n14  Climate Resilience Measures (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nsector development, implement and operate urban infrastructure, and deliver essential urban \nservices. The project will provide capacity development and training support in line with the \ndecentralization and deconcentration program. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects. In undertaking the cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis, the quantification of economic benefits depended on the nature of the subproject. \nBenefits that were quantified included savings in vehicle operating cost and travel time for the \nroad subproject. Quantifiable economic benefits from the drainage and flood control subprojects \ninclude health benefits, reduction of flood damage, and improvement in economic productivity; \neconomic efficiency of recovering recyclable wastes and reduction in costs of disposal for the \nmaterials recovery facilities; and willingness to pay for the wastewater system and solid waste \nmanagement. The expected beneficiaries of the overall project constitute a diverse group that \nincludes road users, business establishments, tourism service providers, property owners, and \nhouseholds. The base case results indicate all components are economically viable with an \nestimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  ranging  from  12%  to  30%,  which  exceeds  the \nassumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital of  12%.  Except for the  Neak  Loeung flood \nprotection  subproject  where  two  of  the  sensitivity  tests  were  below  12%,  all  the  other \nsubprojects are viable under adverse scenarios in which costs are higher and/or benefits lower \nby 10% than the base case.15 \n \n27.  For  the  three  towns  with  urban  road  subprojects,  the  provincial  authority  has  to \nprovide funds to  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  through  annual \nbudgetary allocations to cover the required O&M costs and ensure project sustainability. The \nfinancial analysis focuses on historical annual budget allocations to the provincial departments \nof public works and transport. The wastewater treatment, solid waste management, materials \nrecovery  facility,  and  Mekong  River  embankment  protection  subprojects  are  considered \nrevenue-generating,  thus  financial  internal  rates  of  return  were  computed  taking  into \nconsideration the fees or income that can be generated from their operation. The financial \ninternal rates of return range from 4.2% to 7.3%, all higher than the computed weighted average \ncost of capital.16  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  An  assessment  of  the  financial  management  and  fund  disbursement  system,  and \nprocurement capacity indicates that MPWT adheres to the transparency and accountability \nelements of good governance. Through direct participation and involvement in the procurement \nprocedures of ADB-financed projects, MPWT developed the institutional capacity to undertake \ninternational  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works.  However,  given  the  limited \nexperience of the provincial and district authorities in projects funded by official development \nassistance, the project will be implemented by MPWT\u2019s project management unit, with support \nfrom its provincial offices. Capacity development assistance will provide training on financial \nmanagement, fund disbursement, and harmonized procurement guidelines of the government \nand ADB. A good governance framework is attached to the project administration manual.   \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n29.  Urban poverty. The proportion of poor in the towns ranges from 11% in Battambang to \n23% in Poipet. The poor mostly live in areas without adequate running water supply, wastewater \n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nand  solid  waste  collection  and  treatment  services,  and  roads  and  drainage.  They  often \nexperience serious water supply shortages, poor water quality, wastewater pollution, and poor \nurban  environmental  sanitation.  They  have  less  capacity  to  cope  with  the  pollution  and \ndegraded  environments  and,  in  turn,  experience  increased  exposure  and  risks  to  polluted \nsurface  and  groundwater  and  air,  which  compounds  their  poverty  situation.  Through  the \nimplementation of the subprojects, the project will improve the living environment and health \nstatus of urban residents, especially the poor.17  \n \n30.  Gender analysis. The subprojects will provide benefits to women as individuals and as \nhousehold  members.  Street  vending  is  one  of  the  primary  income  sources  for  women. \nUpgrading roads will improve access and mobility, making women\u2019s travel more convenient and \ncomfortable.  Installing  flood  control  structures  and  improving  drainage  and  wastewater \ntreatment will decrease flooding, thus reducing physical damage and exposure to waterborne \ninfections from the overflow of drains, which often carry run-off and wastewater. Women will \nbenefit from eliminating the need for cleanup that takes them away from other productive \nactivities. This will also reduce exposure to waterborne infections, decreasing the need to care \nfor sick household members and minimizing women\u2019s own exposure.  \n \n31.  The project will benefit both women and men. Some of the negative impacts that could \ndisproportionately affect women will be addressed through measures included in the gender \naction  plan.18 The  plan  also  includes  activities  that  will  enhance  benefits  for  women  by \nimplementing training and awareness-raising programs that focus on wastewater, environmental \nsanitation  and  disease,  solid  waste  management  and recycling,  and health  education  and \npromotion, including HIV and sexually transmitted infection awareness and prevention.  \n \n32.  The effects of involuntary resettlement on women and households headed by women, \nand required mitigation are discussed in each of the prepared resettlement plans. The design \nand monitoring framework includes gender-specific targets, and the key features of the gender \naction plan are incorporated in the framework and the project administration manual.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n  \n33.  Environment (category B). The subprojects are not expected to cause irreversible and \nadverse environment impacts. The initial environmental examinations conducted for all the \nproject cities identified potential impacts and mitigation measures to be implemented through \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs).19 The  initial  environmental  examinations  are  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the applicable environment \nregulations of the government. They indicate that the potential impacts of the subprojects are \nprimarily construction-related and can be mitigated with good practices in construction outlined \nin the EMPs. At the detailed design stage, when the EMPs are updated and finalized, the final \nreceiving environments for the wastewater treatment plants and landfill will be reviewed to \nensure that local groundwater and human use of the affected areas are not adversely affected. \nEstimated costs for implementing the EMP are integrated into the project costs. The final EMPs, \ncleared by ADB, will form part of the contract bidding documents. The adequate incorporation of \nenvironmental considerations during design and allocation of sufficient budget for O&M will \n                                                \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Gender Action Plan (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Battambang  Subproject;  Initial \nEnvironmental  Examination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Bavet  Subproject;  Initial  Environmental \nExamination:  Environmental  Management  Plan  for  Neak  Loeung  Subproject;  and  Initial  Environmental \nExamination: Environmental Management Plan for Poipet Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nmitigate potential adverse impacts during operation. Effective environmental monitoring at all \nstages of subproject implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure and consultation requirements, the safeguard documents will be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. A grievance redress mechanism was developed and is included in the safeguard \ndocument to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance.  \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). One of the subprojects (flood control in Neak \nLoeung) has significant resettlement impacts. Resettlement plans were prepared for each of the \nsubprojects that will trigger land acquisition and resettlement impacts: (i) wastewater treatment \nand flood protection, Battambang; (ii) wastewater treatment, Poipet; and (iii) flood control, Neak \nLoeung.20 Due  diligence  studies  were  prepared  for  the  seven  subprojects  without  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts:  (i)  flood  control,  Battambang;  (ii)  urban  road,  Bavet; \n(iii) wastewater, Bavet; (iv) solid waste management, Poipet; (v) materials recovery facility, \nBavet; (vi) materials recovery facility, Poipet; and (vii) materials recovery facility, Battambang. A \ntotal of 12.9 hectares will be acquired and 1,249 households (6,582 people) will be affected by \nthe priority subprojects. Of these, 315 households and 1,671 people represent the subproject of \nNeak Loeung, 185 households (787 people) the subprojects in Poipet, and 744 households \n(4,091 people) in subproject in Battambang. The flood protection subproject in Neak Loeung will \nhave significant impacts, with 63 affected households (298 affected persons) losing more than \n10% of their productive land. The Battambang flood protection subproject will have five affected \nhouseholds  (33  affected  persons)  requiring  relocation,  while  one  affected  household  (five \naffected persons) will require relocation under the Poipet flood protection subproject. All other \nimpacts are partial and temporary. The cost is estimated to be $1.65 million, which includes \nbase  costs,  allowances,  and  contingencies.  Project  information  was  disclosed  to  affected \npersons throughout project preparation, and a project information booklet will be updated and \ndistributed during a detailed measurement survey. Resettlement documents were prepared in \nconsultation  with  local  communities  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nCambodia\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation  requirements,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website. A \n \ngrievance redress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding project \nperformance. The resettlement plans will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and \ncleared by ADB prior to contract awards.  \n \n35.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  Cambodian  population  comprises  Khmer, \nCham, Chinese, Vietnamese, and a smaller number of Lao and hill tribes. None of the 24 \nindigenous groups reside in the participating corridor towns. For all the project towns, the \nsurveys undertaken for the poverty and social assessments identified that the subproject areas \nare predominantly Khmer. The beneficiary communities, which include some nonindigenous \nminorities, are supportive of the subprojects, as they can see clear and direct benefits for them, \nand understand that the adverse impacts are manageable and can be properly mitigated. The \nsocial assessment confirms that the project is under category C, which does not require the \npreparation of an indigenous peoples plan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n36.  The major risk elements associated with the project are presented in detail in the risk \nmanagement plan and summarized in Table 5.21 \n                                                \n20  Resettlement Plan: Battambang Wastewater Treatment; Resettlement Plan: Neak Loeung Flood Control; and \nResettlement Plan: Poipet Wastewater Treatment Plant and Solid Waste Management (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5:  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMajor Risks  Mitigation Measures \nCorridor  towns  are  unable  to  collect  revenues  for  Ministry  of  Public Works  and  Transport  will  pursue  the \nwastewater  treatment  plants,  sanitary  landfill,  and  planned establishment of local authorities for the collection \nsolid waste management.  of fees and charges for urban environment infrastructure to \nrecover  the  cost  for  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditures.   \nMunicipalities not yet fully prepared collect revenues  The project towns will introduce business plans and cost \nfor  operation  and  maintenance  of  urban  recovery instruments for revenue earning services (waste \ninfrastructure.  water treatment, solid waste management).  \nProcurement and corruption risks do exist.

ASSURANCES  \n \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursements as described in detail in the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.
