THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Featured Agriculture and Financial \nServices System Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project aims to support the production and access to market of featured \nagricultural products in the southeastern Gansu Province. The project will also help develop the \nrural financial service system, which plays a key role in agricultural development. The project \nproposes to adopt the financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality, which through establishing \npartnerships with local commercial banks, can promote the development of the agriculture and \nrural finance sectors in a market-oriented approach. The project is expected to help increase the \nincome of farmer households as well as other rural residents in the project area.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  While the PRC has achieved remarkable economic growth since the late 1970s, rural \ndevelopment remains an important challenge. Rural poverty is more pervasive and persistent in \nthe western and inland provinces than the more advanced coastal regions. Some key policy \nchallenges  include  how  to  (i)  restructure  and  modernize  the  agriculture  sector  toward \nsustainable  and  faster  productivity  growth,  (ii)  diversify  agriculture  production  and  create \nmodern agricultural value chains that allow for the professionalization of farmers and support \nrural income growth, (iii) reform rural institutions and improve the financial institutions serving \nthe rural sector, and (iv) protect land and water resources for food security and environmental \nsustainability.  \n \n4.  The project area covers 11 counties in the sourtheastern Gansu, which have enormous \ndemand and potential for modern agricultural development. The project area is located in one of \n14 areas of national focus for poverty reduction designated in the Outline for Development-\nOriented Poverty Reduction for China\u2019s Rural Areas, 2011\u20132020. Most people in the project \narea depend on agriculture and livestock, and are poor and vulnerable. The average rural per \ncapita net income in 2013 was CNY4,122\u201481% of the provincial average and 46% of the \nnational average. All the farms are very small, averaging about 2.5 mu per capita or 0.17 \nhectare.3 About 51% of household income in the project area is from farming and livestock, and \nrural  unemployment  and  underemployment  are  significant.  Grain  crop  production,  which \naccounts for about 59% of the total sown area and 33% of household income, is mainly based \non  small-scale  and fragmented  household  operations  with  limited  productive  assets  at  the \nhousehold level. Grain crop production usually only generates marginal profit, if any, since input \ncosts have increased more than grain prices.4 \n   \n5.  Alternatives to grain crops include a number of cash and tree crops that are suitable in \nthe arid and semiarid climatic and soil conditions of the project area. These include various \ntypes of vegetables such as potatoes, edible lilies, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, and celery; \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Gansu \nFeatured Agriculture and Financial Services System Development Project (TA 8417-PRC). \n3  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n4  Data in this section come from government statistic data provided by the provincial project management office \n(PMO) unless otherwise indicated. \n ", "2 \nmedicinal plants such as angelica and Asia bell; and tree crops such as apples and pears. \nThese cash crops, often referred to as featured agriculture, have potential for higher market \nvalue if produced efficiently on scale and with improved quality. The government has tried to \npromote restructuring of the sector by increasing the proportion of featured agriculture activities, \nmainly through financial and technical assistance to farmers and farmer cooperatives to develop \nlarge-scale production bases for these crops. The production base approach is also desirable to \npromote the application of environment-friendly measures such as climate-smart agriculture \npractices and water efficiency techniques. However, progress has been slow because of the \nlimited financial and technical resources available to the government and farmers. \n \n6.  Livestock production, such as sheep, dairy cow, cattle, and pig rearing, is also part of the \nfeatured agriculture and has been another main source of income for farmer households in the \nproject area, contributing 17.6% to total household income. However, livestock and associated \nincome  growth  is  severely  constrained  by  the  limited  scale  of  production  and  traditional \ntechnologies applied. Establishing specialized livestock farms with up-to-date technologies has \nbecome a priority for livestock development. The Gansu Provincial 12th Five-Year Plan for \nAnimal  Husbandry  particularly  encourages  the  establishment  of  production  bases  for \nstandardized livestock farming to enhance productivity and quality of livestock sector. \n \n7.  Farmers also need to access broad markets and understand consumer demands to \ndiversify into higher-value crops and livestock. The challenges of smallholder farmers in this \nregard are characterized by the small quantity and moderate or poor quality of products brought \nto the market. As a result, 70%\u201380% of vegetables produced in Gansu Province are marketed \nthrough local brokers, who go from village to village to collect the products after they have \nobtained contracts from the big buyers. Low levels of organization and weak marketing capacity \nof individual farmers give brokers strong bargaining power. Brokers thus earn a big share of \nprofits  in  the  supply  chain  when  dealing  with  farmers  at  the  farm  gate.  Although  farmer \ncooperatives and agricultural small and medium-sized enterprises (ASMEs) have played an \nincreasing role in linking farmers to markets, they are still at an early stage of development in \nthe project area.5 They are generally small in scale, having limited capacity to develop a value \nchain or to service their members, have weak governance, and face difficulties obtaining credit. \nExternal  assistance  is  needed  for  them  to  (i)  expand  operations  with  diversified  business \nmodels; (ii) enhance capacity for grading, processing, packing, storing, and marketing; and \n(iii) strengthen governance and management. This would also make them more bankable. \n \n8.  Strong rural financial markets and institutions with sizable outreach is another key factor \nto develop featured agriculture. Although 67 traditional financial institutions or branches, mainly \nrural credit cooperatives and commercial banks, are present in the project counties, they fail to \nmeet  the  demand,  especially  that  of  smallholder  farmers  and  ASMEs,  because  both  their \npriorities and expertise focus on industrial and commercial lending.6 Following recent policies for \nrural financial market development, rural financial service providers (RFSPs) have emerged. \nThese include some 53 microcredit companies, six village and township banks, and 384 rural \nmutual cooperatives that were in the project counties by 2014. The RFSPs are generally smaller, \nbetter appreciating the potential of agricultural projects, and more accustomed to dealing with \nsmall customers. As a result, relatively small loans to agriculture have increased. However, the \nRFSPs are still at an early stage of development and are either prohibited by law or constrained \n                                                \n5  Agricultural  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  are  those  with  annual  sales  revenue  below  or  equal  to \nCNY200 million, which follows the PRC\u2019s national standard issued in 2011. \n6  Data source: China Banking Regulatory Commission. \n ", "3 \nby their short history to take deposits from the public. In addition, they are also short on capable \nstaff and physical and technical capacity to provide more services for rural customers. \n \n9.  Previous experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development \npartners in the sector in the PRC indicates that the government is generally constrained by its \ncapacity and often assumes large credit risks acting as direct lender to agricultural borrowers. \nTo address the issue, the project, whose target subborrowers are all from the private sector with \ndemand  for  small  and  short-term  (1\u20133  years)  credit,  proposes  to  adopt  the  financial \nintermediation loan modality. Active rural financial market reform since the 1990s has led to the \nrise of many local commercial banks in the PRC. Some of them have properly aligned interest \nand capacity in agricultural finance as well as sound governance and incentive systems, and \nthus can serve as good financial intermediaries to onlend to farmers, cooperatives, ASMEs, and \nRFSPs. Through partnerships with local commercial banks and careful implementation, the \nproject could (i) eliminate government exposure to agricultural borrowers by onlending through \nfinancial intermediaries that are better positioned to assess and assume sub-borrower credit \nrisk,  (ii)  use  loan  resources  more  efficiently  by  revolving  loan  proceeds,  and  (iii)  mobilize \nadditional funding resources from financial intermediaries to support agriculture. \n \n10.  The project will assist the project counties in (i) developing market-oriented production of \nlocally featured cash crops, tree crops, and livestock products; (ii) improving market linkages for \nfeatured agricultural products by supporting profitable and promising farmer cooperatives and \nASMEs; and (iii) enhancing rural financial services with increased funding, service capacity, and \ntechnical skills. The project is fully aligned with the government\u2019s agricultural development \nstrategies and policies in the western regions, which encourage farmers to organize themselves \nfor specialized production and call for transforming fragmented production to economic scale \nmarket-oriented  production  through  land  transfer, growth  of farmer  cooperatives  and  agro-\nenterprises, and enhanced rural financial services. The project is also in line with the upcoming \nADB country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which identifies inclusive growth as \none of its three pillars, supported by boosting rural livelihoods and improving access to finance, \nand with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.7 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be increased income of rural residents in Gansu Province, which is in \nline with the upcoming 13th Five Year Plan of Gansu Province, 2016\u20132020. The outcome will be \nmore productive, market-oriented agricultural activities in 11 project counties. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output  1:  Inclusive  and  environment-friendly  featured  agricultural  production \nbases developed. This output aims to address low agricultural productivity and value addition \ncaused  by  fragmented  production  by  (i)  developing  commercial  production  bases  to  gain \neconomy of scale, and (ii) improving the quality of products for locally featured cash and tree \ncrops and livestock. The production bases will be developed by farmers, farmer cooperatives, or \nASMEs in various models, which will organize or engage individual farmers into more efficient \nand market-oriented production activities. Capacity development will be also conducted for \nfarmers, technicians, and other stakeholders in developing the production bases. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Output  2:  Farmer  cooperatives  and  agricultural  enterprises  financed  and \nstrengthened. This output will improve the value chain for locally featured agricultural products \nwith good market potential to link farmers to profitable markets. The project will support farmer \ncooperatives and ASMEs in (i) business development or expansion through the acquisition of \npacking, grading, and processing equipment; transportation, technical equipment; and building \nstorage; (ii) market development, including information access, sales promotion, and building \nmarketing networks; (iii) branding, including certification and trademark registration for featured \nproducts; and (iv) capacity development for the managers and key staff of cooperatives and \nASMEs on business and financial management, storing and processing techniques, branding \nand market development, and establishing and implementing governance rules and regulations. \n \n14.  Output 3: Rural financial service system developed and enhanced. This output aims \nto  promote  the financial  viability,  coverage,  and  sustainability  of  the rural financial  service \nsystem. The project will (i) onlend part of the loan proceeds to RFSPs to expand their funding \nresources. The RFSPs will use the loan proceeds to lend to farmers, farmer cooperatives, and \nASMEs following agreed eligibility criteria of sub-borrowers; (ii) establish grassroots financial \nservice units such as village offices to extend rural financial service coverage; (iii) develop or \npilot  test  innovative  financial  services  and  products,  such  as  credit  rating,  bank\u2013insurance \ncooperation, and lending with new types of collateral; and (iv) provide capacity development for \nloan  officers  and rural financial  professionals to  improve  their  lending  skills  to  serve  rural \ncustomers. \n \n15.  Output 4: Capacity for project implementation and management strengthened. To \nensure the successful implementation of the project, the following activities will be supported \nunder this output: (i) strengthening the management capacity of staff at provincial and county \nproject management offices (PMOs); (ii) acquiring office equipment to enhance the physical \ncapacity  of  provincial  and  county  PMOs;  (iii)  holding  project  management  workshops; \n(iv) project monitoring and evaluation, including guiding and supporting the implementation of \nthe environmental and social management systems (ESMSs); (v) knowledge management; and \n(vi) ensuring financial capacity for daily operations of provincial and county PMOs. \n \n16.  Special features. The project design embodies the following innovative features: \n(i)  Promoting agricultural development with a systematic and market-oriented \napproach.  The  project  attempts  to  address  challenges  of  agricultural \ndevelopment  and  rural  income  growth  by  improving  productivity,  market \nconnectivity,  and  access  to  finance.  Besides  engaging  farmers  in  more \nproductive agricultural activities via production base development, the project will \nstrengthen  linkages  between  farmer  producers  and  markets  through \ncooperatives  and  ASMEs,  and  promote  continuous  financial  support  to \nagriculture  and  rural  residents  in  the  long  term.  Moreover,  with  partnership \nbetween the government and financial intermediaries, loan resources could be \nallocated in a more market-oriented manner to support sustainable agricultural \nprojects. The government, through its extensive agricultural administrative and \ntechnical systems, could help identify and develop subprojects with significant \nmarket  potential  and  apply  environmentally  sound  practices.  The  financial \nintermediaries\u2019 screening, monitoring, and management of subloans will help \nensure the subprojects are financially viable and sustainable. \n(ii)  Supporting a dynamic and competitive rural financial market. A dynamic and \ncompetitive rural financial market is important to meet growing demand for rural \nfinancial  services,  in  which  RFSPs  could  play  a  significant  role.  Under  the \nexisting policy framework, commercial banks, especially those large- or medium-\n ", "5 \nsized, could lend to RFSPs to increase their capital capacity and support RFSPs \nthrough knowledge sharing. This market link is currently missing. The project will \nhelp build such linkages, as financial intermediaries will onlend the loan proceeds \nto RFSPs together with their own resources and provide training to RFSP staff. \nThis will be on a pilot scale, but could generate a large demonstration effect.  \n(iii)  Partnership  with  local  banks.  Three local commercial banks\u2014the Bank of \nLanzhou, the Bank of Gansu, and the Yuzhong Shanghai Pudong Development \nRural  Bank\u2014are  identified  as  project  financial  intermediaries.  As  small  to \nmedium-sized banks, they share the project\u2019s goals of promoting local agriculture \nand rural finance development in the project area. The financial intermediaries \nwill  onlend  the  majority  of  loan  proceeds  to  targeted  sub-borrowers  for \nagricultural  production  base  development  under  output  1  and  business \ndevelopment or expansion under output 2, and onlend to RFSPs under output 3. \nThey will also contribute about $68.58 million as counterpart funds to be onlent to \nthe targeted sub-borrowers of the project, applying the same requirements and \neligibility, and to strengthen rural financial services in the project area. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $200 million (Table 1) based on the projected first batch \nof subprojects.8 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \u2013 First Batch of Subprojects  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The following principles were followed to determine the amount of taxes \nand duties to be financed  by ADB: (i) the amount is within reasonable country thresholds, (ii) the amount does \nnot represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, (iii) taxes and duties apply only to ADB-\nfinanced expenditures, and (iv) financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \nb  In December 2014 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies are  computed at 5%  for  works and goods.  Price contingencies  are computed using \ndomestic inflation rates: 3.0% for 2015 onward; and foreign inflation rates: 1.0% for 2015 and 1.4% for 2016 \nonward. \nd  Includes interest and a commitment charge to be capitalized under the ADB loan. Interest during construction for \nthe ADB loan has been computed at the  5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus a spread of 0.50% and a maturity \npremium of 0%. Commitment charge is 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n                                                \n8  The  first  batch  refers  to  subprojects  financed  by  loan  proceeds  initially  disbursed  by  ADB  and  financial \nintermediaries\u2019 own funds during the loan implementation period. The first batch of subprojects under outputs 1 and \n2 will be selected from a long list of subprojects proposed and updated by the government. Appendix 1 of the \nProject Administration Manual (PAM) [accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2] describes the \nselection and approval procedures for these subprojects.  Financial intermediaries will revolve the ADB loan \nproceeds to make them available for the subsequent subprojects. For these subprojects, as well as loans made by \nthe financial intermediaries to RFSPs and by RFSPs to sub-borrowers under output 3, financial intermediaries and \nRFSPs will adopt the eligibility criteria in screening the sub-borrowers, which are described in Appendix 2 of PAM. \n ", "6 \n18.  The  government has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  9  years,  a straight\u2013line  repayment  option,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The longer grace period is essential to make the full loan \nprincipal available to maximize project benefits. Based on this, the average loan maturity is \n12.25 years and the maturity premium  payable  to  ADB  is  zero  per annum. The  ADB  loan \nwill also finance taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures, and transportation \nand insurance costs included in the base  cost to ensure smooth project implementation. Interest \nduring construction and commitment charges will be capitalized. The loan will finance 50% of the \nproject cost. \n \n19.  The financial intermediaries need to contribute an equivalent of $68.58 million, or 34.3% \nof the project cost, from their own resources to the project. The counterpart funds from the \nfinancial intermediaries will (i) finance a subset of subprojects for the first batch under outputs 1 \nand 2;9 (ii) be onlent to RFSPs together with ADB funds; and (iii) expand rural finance service \nunits, develop innovative financial services, and strengthen the capacity of rural loan officers of \nfinancial  intermediaries  and  RFSPs.  Subproject  beneficiaries  under  outputs  1  and  2  are \nexpected to contribute an equivalent of $24.67 million in equity, or 12.3% of the project cost, in \nkind and in cash. The rest of the project cost, about $6.75 million equivalent or 3.4% of the total \ncost, will be financed by the Gansu Provincial Government (GPG). \n \n20.  The financing plan is in Table 2. GPG has assured ADB that any additional counterpart \nfunding required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns for the nonfinancial intermediary part \nof the project will be provided.10 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan (First Batch) \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n     Ordinary capital resources  100.00  50.0 \nFinancial intermediaries  68.58  34.3 \nBeneficiaries  24.67  12.3 \nGansu Provincial Government  6.75  3.4 \nTotal  200.00  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  The Government of the PRC will be the borrower of the loan and will relend it to GPG, \nwhich will relend the loan to the participating county governments. For loan proceeds to be \nonlent to sub-borrowers and RFSPs by financial intermediaries, each county government will \nrelend to the financial intermediary assigned to the county in US dollars on the same terms and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. The relending agreement between the government and \nfinancial intermediary will cover, among others, repayment schedule, risk management, financial \nintermediaries\u2019 counterpart funds, and monitoring and reporting. \n \n22.  The subloans from financial intermediaries to farmers, cooperatives, and ASMEs will be \nin local currency; interest rates will be set taking into account the cost of the ADB loan, financial \n                                                \n9  Same terms and conditions as ADB-funded subprojects, including environmental and social management system \nrequirements, apply to these subloans except for the interest cap (para. 22). \n10 The government or financial intermediaries will not cover any shortfall or cost overrun for subprojects. The financial \nintermediaries will require the sub-borrowers to provide counterpart and overrun or shortfall funding. \n ", "7 \nintermediaries\u2019 operational costs, costs to cover credit and exchange risk, and a reasonable profit \nmargin for financial intermediaries, subject to a maximum ceiling.11 The current ceiling of subloan \ninterest rates (6.5%) is within prevailing market rates in the project area (6.5%\u201312.0%) and \nentails a spread for financial intermediaries equivalent to that of their other funding resources.12 \nSubloan tenors will generally be coordinated with subproject needs. For loan proceeds to be \nrelent to RFSPs and onlent by RFSPs to sub-borrowers, no ceiling is applied on the interest rates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  GPG, acting through Gansu Department of Finance, will be the executing agency. The \nbureaus of agriculture and animal husbandry (BAAHs) in the project counties and the three \nfinancial  intermediaries  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  provincial  PMO  has  been \nestablished within the provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and the \ncounty PMO has been established within each BAAH. \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangementsa \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  The Foreign Capital Management Committee of GPG will be the project \nleading group acting through its office at Gansu\u2019s Department of Finance to \nsupervise and coordinate the project activities. The committee is chaired by a \nvice governor and consists of all relevant government agencies. \n(ii)  Executing agency  GPG, acting through Gansu\u2019s Department of Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  BAAHs of Hezheng, Huan, Jingchuan, Jishishan, Kongtong, Lingtai, Lintao, \nMin, Yongjing, Yuzhong, and Zhenyuan counties of Gansu Province, and \nthree financial intermediaries (Bank of Gansu, Bank of Lanzhou, and Yuzhong \nShanghai Pudong Development Rural Bank) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  BAAHs, county branches of financial intermediaries, RFSPs, and sub-\nborrowers in the project counties \nProcurement  Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). For subprojects funded with \nsubloans made by financial intermediaries and RFSPs, procurement will be \nundertaken by the sub-borrowers in accordance with established private \nsector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB. \nShopping  35 contracts  $830,040 \nConsulting services  Project implementation consultants will be hired using government counterpart \nfunds following the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s public bidding procedure. \nRetroactive financing and/or  GPG, BAAHs, and financial intermediaries have requested advance \nadvance contracting  contracting and retroactive financing to enable early commencement of \nprocurement of goods and training by the government and sub-loans by \nfinancial intermediaries. The details of activities to be financed and their \njustification will be set out in a written request to ADB. The executing and \nimplementing agencies have been advised that (i) approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \n                                                \n11 Financial intermediaries have agreed with the government that (i) when ADB\u2019s loan interest rate is below or equal to \n2%, the ceiling is 6.5%; and (ii) the ceiling will be increased by 0.5 percentage points if ADB\u2019s interest rate exceeds \n2% and by another 0.5 percentage points each time ADB\u2019s interest rate increases 0.5 percentage points thereafter. \nFor instance, if ADB\u2019s loan interest rate falls in 2+~2.5%, the ceiling is 7%, and so on. \n12 The information is based on the reports by the provincial PMO, financial intermediaries, and project preparatory \ntechnical assistance team. \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nproject, and (ii) retroactive financing may only apply up to 20% of the amount \nof ADB loan in respect of expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness, but \nnot earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan agreement. All advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe issuance of invitations for bids, bidding documents, bid evaluations, \nrecommendation of contract awards, and subloan contracts under advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. An \nenvironmental and social management system should be established by \nfinancial intermediaries and approved by ADB before financial intermediaries \nstart to review subloan applications. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. A statement of \nexpenditure procedure will be used for subloans up to the free limits of \n$100,000 for farmers and $1 million for farmer cooperatives and agricultural \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. Subloans exceeding the free limits will \nrequire ADB\u2019s prior approval. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BAAH = bureau of agriculture and animal husbandry, GPG = Gansu Provincial \nGovernment, RFSP = rural financial service provider. \na  The project implementation period extends beyond the loan completion date because of the financial intermediation \nloan modality, which will revolve loan proceeds to finance new subprojects. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Gansu Provincial Government. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The project is located in an arid region subject to drought. A climate risk vulnerability \nassessment  indicates  potential  temperature  increases,  and  precipitation  variation  could \nadversely affect the success of the subprojects. To mitigate these risks, all relevant subprojects \nare required to adopt climate-smart farming and water-efficient practices as project objectives \nstated in the design and monitoring framework, and subject to a procedural step in the ESMS. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Financial and economic analysis was carried out for 13 types of agriculture production \nbases, 12 representative ASMEs, 11 farmer cooperatives, and the project as a whole. Financial \nanalysis indicates that the financial internal rates of return of the production bases are 13.2%\u2013\n29.3%,  and  the  financial  internal  rates  of  return  of  the  ASME  and  farmer  cooperative \nsubprojects are 16.3%\u201327.2%, which are all well above the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital of 3.4%. Economic analysis shows that the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of \nthe agricultural production bases are 15.1%\u201349.0%, the EIRRs of the ASME and cooperative \nsubprojects are 11.2%\u201326.9%, and the EIRR for the whole project is estimated to be 15.8%. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  GPG  has  extensive  experience  in  administering  projects  financed  by  multilateral \ninstitutions, including ADB and the World Bank. Gansu\u2019s Department of Finance, which will \noperate and manage the imprest account, has sufficient experience in administering projects \nfinanced by ADB. Although the provincial PMO and BAAHs have the financial management \ncapacity, they lack experience in managing or implementing ADB projects. The three financial \nintermediary banks have rigorous internal control and risk control systems. The employees \n ", "9 \ngenerally have a good educational background and receive training periodically. Their financial \nmanagement capacity is sufficient to participate in the project.13 The financial management \nassessment concluded that the overall premitigation financial management risk is moderate. \nCapacity building will be conducted and project implementation consultants will be engaged to \nimplement the project in line with ADB policies and procedures. The financial management risks \nand mitigation measures will be reviewed and updated during project implementation. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A social and gender action \nplan has been developed, which will guide GPG, the BAAHs, and financial intermediaries to \nscreen and enhance subproject proposals to ensure they provide social benefits, and contribute \nto improved gender equality in the project area. Overall, the project is expected to benefit over \n27,000 rural households in the first batch of subprojects to be completed over the first 5 years of \nproject  implementation  through  various  training  programs,  organizing  for  more  efficient \nproduction, on- and off-farm employment, and income-generating transactions such as land use \nright transfer on a voluntary basis. Among the beneficiaries, 30% are expected to be poor, and \n30% or more to be women (depending on the activities). At least 50% of signees of subloan \ncontracts will include women. Since the loan proceeds will be revolved, more rural households \nwill further benefit from the project. The project will also make more credit available to rural \ncommunities in the project area by providing funding to RFSPs. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The project is classified FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. An ESMS document will be prepared by each financial intermediary bank and RFSPs \nbased on the agreed ESMS template prepared with GPG and the financial intermediaries, and \napproved by ADB before the first disbursement to the financial intermediaries.14 Safeguard-\nrelated eligibility criteria are defined in the template ESMS, which exclude any subproject that \n(i) should  be  categorized  category  A  for  environment  or  indigenous  peoples,  (ii)  involves \ninvoluntary land acquisition and resettlement (category A or B), or (iii) involves activities in the \nprohibited investment activities list of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement  (2009) and other \nactivities  listed  in  the  ESMS.  The  financial  intermediaries  and  RFSPs  are  responsible  for \nimplementing the ESMS under the supervision of the provincial PMO. The provincial PMO will \nengage project implementation consultants to provide assistance and training to the staff of \nfinancial  intermediaries  and  RFSPs  for  ESMS  implementation.  The  ESMS  template  was \nformulated based on consultations with local people. The ethnic minority development plan and \nESMS (including the ethnic minorities planning framework) were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on \n8 June 2015. The relevant BAAH or financial intermediaries will ensure adequate consultation \nand disclosure have been done prior to subproject approval. \n \n \n \n                                                \n13 Due Diligence of Financial Intermediaries (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.
