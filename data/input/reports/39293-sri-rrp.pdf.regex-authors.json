It  helps  increase  equity  of \naccess  to  quality  teaching  and  learning  by  upgrading  one \nprovincially administered secondary school in each of the 150 \npoorest administrative divisions. The upgraded schools will offer \nadvanced level science streams, and teaching in key subjects \nsuch as information and communication technology (ICT), English \nand technical subjects.  \nThe Project will support Government reform in competency-based \neducation  (CBE)  through  the  development  of  curriculum, \ninstructional  materials,  performance  standards  and  teacher \ntraining.  It  will  continue  supporting  mainstreaming  of  School-\nBased  Assessment  (SBA).  It  will  help  improve  the  quality  of \nEnglish teaching by supporting the establishment of a Center of \nExcellence  in  English  Education  (CEIEE).  It  will  continue \nsupporting the expansion of ICT education and the use of ICT in \nlearning. The Project will upgrade Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced \nTechnological Education (SLIATE) institutions into more market-\nresponsive tertiary education providers. It will promote a senior-\nlevel  inter-agency  policy  dialogue  to  strengthen  linkages  and \npartnerships  between  general  and  tertiary  education,  technical \neducation and vocational training (TEVT), and the private sector. \nGovernance and service delivery will improve through education \nmanagement and leadership training programs, development of \nan  integrated  management  information  system,  strengthened \ncareer guidance, and social marketing programs to support the \nchange  of  prevailing  attitudes  and  bias  to  university  degree \nadmission as the only option for secondary school students. In \naddition,  the  Project  will  support  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  health \neducation.  \n   ", "ii \nRationale  The education system needs to adjust to the changing needs of \nthe  modern  economy.  The  school  system  is  oriented  toward \nconventional university education and does not teach skills and \nattitudes that are relevant to labor market needs. Intake capacity \nof tertiary education, including TEVT is still limited. As a result, \nmost young school leavers lack the necessary competencies to fit \ninto  the  workplace.  Many  unemployed  are  educated  youth. \nTherefore, there is a need to improve the quality and relevance of \nsecondary education, and to broaden learning options at tertiary \nlevel. Introducing CBE, and strengthening teaching of science and \ntechnology,  English,  technical  subjects  and  ICT  will  increase \nskills-based  competitiveness  in  areas  of  high  demand: \nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors.  Strengthening  career \nguidance  and  social  marketing  programs  to  orient  students \ntowards  wider  tertiary  education  options,  including  non-\nconventional  tertiary  programs  and  TEVT  will  help  broaden \nlearning options and career paths for educated youth.      \n \nRegional disparities are acute in access to sciences, English, ICT, \nand technical subjects. The Northern and Eastern provinces and \nthe plantation areas particularly lack resources. Increasing equity \nof access to quality education irrespective of regions, gender and \nethnic groups is a key priority of the Government.    \n \nAlthough Sri Lanka has low prevalence of HIV infection, lack of \nawareness of the risk of infectious diseases increase the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to an epidemic. Successful prevention and control \nwould  depend  on  the  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  of \nadolescents  and  youth.  This  calls  for  expanded  access  to \ninformation and education for a healthy life.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Project is the increased relevance of \nsecondary and tertiary education to labor market requirements, \nwhich will lead to increased employability of educated youth. The \nexpected  outcome  of  the  Project  is  the  improved  quality, \nrelevance, effectiveness, and equity of access to secondary and \ntertiary education. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The total investment cost is estimated at $105.3 million including \ntaxes and duties of $8.0 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $65.0 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and an ADF grant of $15.0 \nmillion equivalent to help finance the Project. The ADB loan and \ngrant will finance 76% of the project cost. The Government is to \nprovide $25.3 million equivalent, or 24% of the total project cost, \nto cover (i) 40% of civil work cost; (ii) 29% of local training cost; \n(iii)  100%  of  the  loan  project  cost  on  office  overhead  and \noperation, operation and maintenance of project facilities including \nvehicles,  computers,  equipment,  and  furniture;  and  (iv)  all  the \ntaxes and duties. ", "iii \n   \n  The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% during \nthe  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n \nIn addition, the Government has requested a grant of $15.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ADF resources to help finance a scholarship program, \nan  Initiative  for  Innovative  ICT  for  Learning  (IIIL),  and  the \nHIV/AIDS health education component. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education (MOE)  \n   \nImplementation  The project steering committee (PSC) of the ongoing Secondary \nArrangements  Education Modernization Project II (SEMP II) will be enlarged and \nserve as the PSC of the Project. It will direct the Project, monitor \nits activities and outputs, guide the Project Management Office \n(PMO),  and  coordinate  with  other  government  agencies  and \ndepartments. The Secretary of MOE will chair the PSC, whose \nmembers will comprise representatives of the Ministry of Higher \nEducation, Ministry of Vocational and Technical Training, MOE, \nFinance  Commission,  External  Resources  Department  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  National  Planning  Department,  National \nInstitute  of  Education,  National  Education  Testing  Services, \nprovincial  ministries  of  education,  National  Education \nCommission, Ministry of Health, and Federation of Chambers of \nCommerce and Industry, as well as one Provincial Director of \nEducation on a rotating basis. To ensure complementarity with \nSEMP II, the same PMO will take responsibility of managing the \nProject, with additional staff.   \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Each contract for goods and services \nof  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  contract \npackages  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  National \nCompetitive  Bidding  (NCB).  All  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nawarded  through  NCB.  Before  the  commencement  of  any \nprocurement  activity  under  NCB,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will \nreview the Borrower\u2019s procurement law to ensure consistency with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Minor items valued at less than \n$10,000 equivalent will be procured directly following Government \nprocedures.  \n   \n ", "iv \nConsulting Services  The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be \nfinanced under the Project will be in accordance with Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nA team of consultants will be engaged to provide services in a \nrange of specializations, with estimated international inputs of 69 \nperson-months and national inputs of 300 person-months under \nthe loan, and 15 person-months of international inputs and 54 \nperson-months of national inputs under the grant. The consultants \nwill be engaged through firms using the quality-and cost-based \nselection  method.  The  quality-cost  ratio  will  be  80:20. \nApproximately 3 international and 4 national consultants will be \nengaged through individual recruitment. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit primary and secondary school students in \nBeneficiaries  the 150 poorest administrative divisions. The upgraded schools \nwill provide them with quality teaching in key subjects of sciences, \nEnglish, ICT, and technical subjects. This will widen their options \nfor tertiary education, and ultimately their career path. Reform in \nCBE  will  make  education  more  outcomes-based,  thus  more \npractical.  Expansion  of  SBA  will  make  assessment  more \ncomprehensive  and  less  centered  on  national  examination. \nStrengthened  use  of  ICT  for  learning  will  diversify  and  enrich \nteaching and learning. Enhanced linkages with industry will make \nstudents understand the world of work. Capacity enhancement of \nprincipals and education administrators will improve management \nefficiency.  Upgrading  of  SLIATE  will  expand  tertiary  education \nopportunities in all provinces. Education partnerships will have a \npositive  institutional  impact.  It  will  help  the  system  to  become \nmore responsive to diversified needs, secure more resources to \neducation, and to have a holistic view of the education sector. All \nProject  interventions  will  contribute  to  the  knowledge-based \nsociety which the Government envisions.   \n \nAs the proportion of schools to benefit from Project interventions \nwill follow the School Census Data, equity among Sinhala, Tamil, \nand  Muslim  students  will  be  ensured.  An  affirmative  action  to \naddress  weakness  in  English  teaching  in  Tamil  schools  will \nespecially benefit Tamil medium students. Expansion of tertiary \neducation opportunities through SLIATE will also allow access to \nhigher skills by poor students from all ethnic groups, leading to \nbetter jobs in both local and foreign markets.  \n   ", "v \nThe Project will ensure that all target beneficiaries gain access to \nRisks and Assumptions \nresources provided by the Project irrespective of gender, ethnicity, \nand geographic location. However, security concerns may affect \nproject activities in the conflict-affected areas. The Project will \nbuild maximum flexibility in its implementation. For instance, for \nthe upgrading of secondary schools, if in any given year selected \nschools from the Northern Province cannot be upgraded due to \nsecurity concerns, those schools will be replaced in that year with \nschools from another province, but the overall project quota for \nschools to be upgraded from Northern Province will not change. \nFurthermore,  reallocation  of  funds  among  schools  within  the \nNorthern  Province  will  be  agreed  between  MOE  and  ADB. \nRefurbishment of schools in the conflict-affected areas will only \ntake place with the assurances of a return to peace and security. \nClose  monitoring  of  security  conditions  will  mitigate  risks.  The \nstatus of project implementation in the conflict-affected areas will \nbe assessed periodically and adjustment will be made in project \nscope or implementation arrangements as necessary. The Project \nwill not cause displacement of any families or households as civil \nworks are limited to existing school property and the renovation of \nexisting buildings. In the event that land acquisition is required, \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) will be followed. No \nadverse environment impact is anticipated. Civil works will follow \ncountry  specific  environmental  guidelines  and  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Disposal of hazardous chemicals that \nmay be used during science classes will be consistent with the \nhandling and safe disposal measures already employed in the \nsecondary schools in the country. \n   \n \n \n \n \n ", "80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\nSRI  LANKA\nP a l k     S t r a i t KankasantKuoradiikamam EDUCASTOICOINE TFYO PRR KONJOEWCTLEDGE\nJaffna\nKilinochchi\nNational Capital\nP a l k     B a y\nChief Provincial Town\nMullaittivu City/Town\nTanniyuttu\nNational Road\nMankulam Provincial Road\nTalaimannar\n9 o 00'N NORTHERN Railway 9 o 00'N\nPuliyankulam River\nMannar\nProvincial Boundary\nVavuniya Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nGulf   of   Mannar\nTrincomalee\nHorowupotana\nAnuradhapura\nNORTH  CENTRAL\nB a y     o f     B e n g a l\nTambuttegama\nKekirawa\nPuttalam\nWelikanda\nPolonnaruwa Valaichchenai\nDambulla\nEASTERN\nBatticaloa\nNORTH\nChilaw WESTERN\nKurunegala Matale\nMadampe\nCENTRAL\nPolgahawela\nKandy\nMawanella Ampara\nNegombo Warakapola\nMinuwangoda Kegalle\nGampola\nGampaha\n7 o 00'N Talawakele Nuwara Eliya Badulla 7 o 00'N\nColombo Avissawella Welimada\nU V A\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE Hatton Monaragala\nMoratuwa WESTERN Bandarawela\nRatnapura Wellawaya\nPelmadulla Balangoda\nKalutara\nSABARAGAMUWA\nAlutgama\nElpitiya\nAmbalangoda\nHikkaduwa SOUTHERN N\nAkuressa Hambantota\nGalle\nMatara Tangalle\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nKilometers\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\n07-3077 RM", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education \nfor Knowledge Society Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka has achieved universal primary education, high literacy rates, and gender \nequity in basic education. In 2006, the completion rate at junior secondary level reached 84%.  \nPerformance  at  senior  secondary  level  has  significantly  improved  since  2001  as  result  of \nGovernment\u2019s efforts and external support such as that of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nBetween 2001 and 2006, the General Certificate ordinary level (O level) examination pass rate \nincreased from 37% to 49%, and the General Certificate advanced level (A level) examination \npass rate increased from 50% to 60%. Pass rates in science, mathematics and English remain \nlower than the average, thus further improvement is needed. Students who fail the O level \nexamination repeat the test. Those who passed O level generally continue to A level. A level \ngraduates compete for university and other tertiary education institutions, but the system has \nsuch limited intake capacity that only about 11% of those who qualify are admitted to tertiary \neducation institutions. Others enroll in Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) \nprograms. With ADB support, quality and relevance of TEVT programs have improved, but \noptions for higher skills upgrade are still limited. Overall, performance at secondary level has \nimproved, but bottlenecks entering tertiary level institutions, including TEVT undermine the \nachievement and efficiency gained in primary level.  \n \n3.  Unemployment in Sri Lanka declined from 8.8% in 2002 to 6.6% in 2006. However, the \nunemployment rates among O level and A level graduates were 12% and 14%, respectively. Of \nthe total unemployed, 44% were below O level, 28% were O level graduates and another 28% \nwere A level graduates while 55% of the unemployed were below 29 years old. These figures \nshow that many unemployed are educated youth. This is partly due to lack of job opportunities \nbut also largely due to the mismatch between the supply from the education system and the \ndemands of the labor market. Thus, Sri Lanka needs to increase both internal and external \nefficiency of its education system, if the sector is to play a key role in national economic growth. \nA sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  Labor Market Conditions and Demand. The labor market has undergone significant \nchanges  since  1990:  employment  in  agriculture  has  decreased  while  employment  in  the \nmanufacturing and services sectors has increased. Employment in foreign countries through \nremittances from expatriate workers has become a key component of the economy. Labor \nmarket data and projections show an increasing demand for skilled and semi-skilled labor in \nconstruction,  health  care,  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  and  other \nmanufacturing and service sectors in local and foreign markets. If a favorable political and \neconomical  environment  can  promote  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  development, \nproductive and skill-intensive formal and informal sector employment will also expand.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the Education \nSector Development Program. Manila.   ", " 2 \n5.  Sector Challenges. Globalization and the impact of economic and technological change \nin Asia open opportunities and challenges for Sri Lanka\u2019s future labor force. Asia\u2019s transition to a \nknowledge-based  economy  will  create  more  job  opportunities  for  educated  youth.  As  a \nproductive and competitive economy, it will require high level skills in specific fields as well as \nincreasing diversified and updated skills. To meet such future demand, quality and relevant \nsecondary and tertiary education, including TEVT, need to expand. More flexible and broader \nlearning options at each education level should be made available. As such, ministries involved \nin education can no longer finance and provide education alone; neither can the education \nsystem  work  in  isolation  from  other  sectors.  A  key  sector  challenge  is  to  build  effective \npartnerships  among  multiple  governmental,  private,  and  community  stakeholders  to  make \neducation more responsive to the needs of the economy.  \n     \n6.  Reorienting  the  School  System.  The  school  system  has  traditionally  focused  on \nscreening and selection for conventional university education. As a consequence, students lack \npractical  and  generic  skills  and  attitudes  that  are  needed  in  the  labor  market,  such  as \ncommunications, team work, problem solving, and critical thinking. Career guidance is weak. \nAlthough only a few students can enroll in university, parents and students have a traditional \npreference for university degree admission as the only option for higher skills upgrade. As the \neconomy becomes more dynamic, education must become more practical and relevant to labor \nmarket needs. Thus, the school system needs to prepare and orient students to wider learning \noptions  and  career  paths,  including  non-university  tertiary  education  and  TEVT  programs. \nEducation content and teaching methodologies should become more competency based, life \noriented, and applied to current and future labor market needs.  \n \n7.  Equity of Access to Key Study Areas. Another key challenge is to increase the equity \nof access to quality teaching and learning. Although science streams have better employment \nprospects, many A level students opt for art streams. This is because of the lack of science \nteachers and laboratories, especially in rural areas. Out of 2,300 senior secondary schools, still \nonly about 700 provide teaching in A level science. Access to ICT in education has gradually \nexpanded since 2001, however it is still limited to large schools in urban areas. As such, \nregional disparities in access to quality education persist, with the unequal distribution of school \nfacilities, teachers, and teaching-learning resources. As a consequence, large, well equipped \nurban schools are overcrowded, while poorly equipped schools in remote areas are in decline. \nConflict-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces and resource-starved rural and plantation \nareas particularly suffer. The shortage of teachers in science, mathematics, and English is acute \nin the rural areas, in both Sinhala and Tamil language schools. Gender stereotypes affect girl \nstudents opting for science and technology fields. Ultimately, children from disadvantaged areas \nhave little chance of breaking the poverty cycle by getting into schools leading to better career \nprospects. Continuous efforts are needed to upgrade schools in rural areas and to promote \nequitable deployment of teachers across regions and medium of instruction. Specific attention is \nrequired to support education in the conflict-affected areas to ensure that children in those areas \nare not excluded from the benefits of modern knowledge and technologies. \n \n8.  Management Efficiency. In part due to a policy of decentralization,2 different policies, \nprocedures, and resource management systems coexist between national schools administered \nat the central level and provincial schools administered at the provincial level. Such dual system \nand inadequate management capacities at various levels of administration impede the efficiency \nof education governance. School-based management has been introduced to improve school \ngovernance and quality of teaching through bottom-up planning and resources management. \n                                                 \n2 In 1987, the Government devolved education management to the nine provinces (see Appendix 2).    ", "3 \nHowever, further strengthening of managerial capacity and professional development of school \nprincipals and education officers at all levels are needed to improve management efficiency. \nFurthermore, streamlining and modernizing administrative systems by introducing an integrated \nmanagement information system will help rationalize operational procedures at all levels.  \n \n9.  Tertiary Education and Education Finance. Better performance and more graduates \nat the secondary level lead to increasing demand for education at the tertiary level. However, \npublic resource constraints limit the expansion and modernization of tertiary education. Sri \nLanka has a relatively low public expenditure on education, which is 3% of its gross domestic \nproduct and about 9% of total government expenditure in 2007. Moreover, education is free up \nto the university first degree level, thus it relies heavily on public resources. With Government \nbudget  constraints,  access,  quality,  and  relevance  of  education  cannot  be  maintained  or \nenhanced without cost recovery measures and greater private sector involvement. However, the \ncurrent political environment does not favor establishment of private universities, or the concept \nof cost recovery in the university system. Therefore, tertiary education institutions outside of the \nuniversity system, including postsecondary TEVT programs, will play a greater role in providing \nhigher skills upgrade opportunities. Non-conventional institutions such as the Sri Lanka Institute \nfor  Advanced  Technological  Education  (SLIATE),  award  National  Diploma  (ND)  and  High \nNational Diploma (HND) level qualifications for mid-level engineering and business professions. \nWhile an overarching policy on tertiary education and revised regulatory frameworks are needed \nfor  long-term  reforms,  a  key  medium-term  strategy  is  to  strengthen  capacity  of  existing \ninstitutions such as SLIATE to meet immediate demands.  \n \n10.  HIV/AIDS and Health Education. Although Sri Lanka has a low prevalence of HIV \ninfection,  lack  of  awareness  of  the  risk  of  infectious  diseases  increases  the  country\u2019s \nvulnerability to an epidemic. Successful prevention and control would depend on the knowledge, \nattitudes, and practices of adolescents and youth. This calls for expanded access to information \nand education for a healthy life. Schools are well placed to address this need. To reap the full \nbenefit  of  the  investment  in  education,  those  who  pass  through  the  system  must  acquire \nsufficient well-rounded knowledge and skills to remain healthy and productive throughout their \nlifetime.  \n \n11.  Government Strategy. The Government\u2019s ten year development plan (2006\u20132015) calls \nfor an education system that will provide the technological skills required for a knowledge-based \nsociety to underpin rapid economic and social development. Key Government strategies in \ngeneral education3 are to: (i) introduce competency-based education (CBE) at the secondary \nlevel to make education more life-skills oriented; (ii) strengthen teaching in ICT, languages \nincluding English, sciences, and technical subjects; (iii) upgrade one secondary school in each \nof the 325 administrative divisions to full-fledged schools to enhance equitable access to quality \neducation  nationwide;  (iv)  delineate  primary  schools  (grades  1\u20135)  from  secondary  schools \n(grades 6\u201313) for better rationalization; (v) strengthen the linkage between general education, \ntertiary education, and TEVT; (vi) introduce school-based teacher appointment as a measure to \nensure equitable distribution of teachers; and (vii) strengthen public-private partnerships (PPP) \nin selected fields.  \n \n12.  Harmonized Sector Assistance. The Government has developed an Education Sector \nDevelopment Framework and Program (ESDFP) 2006\u20132010 that provides a policy framework \nand guide for development assistance in general education. The ESDFP calls for a harmonized \napproach to external assistance in general education. External assistance is integrated into the \n                                                 \n3  General education in this context means school education from grades 1 to 13.  \n ", " 4 \nESDFP under the leadership of the Ministry of Education (MOE). ADB, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank provide the largest assistance through \nproject investments and budgetary support. Bilateral agencies have been active in education \nprograms for peace building, school improvement, TEVT, and rehabilitation in the Northern and \nEastern Provinces and tsunami-affected areas. External assistance is described in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  ADB Strategy and its Outcomes. Consistent with Government priorities, ADB\u2019s sector \nstrategy for Sri Lanka4 focuses on raising the quality and relevance of education, increasing \nequity of access, and enhancing employability of graduates. ADB\u2019s education sector policy5 \ncalls for more investment in post-basic and tertiary education, including TEVT, to support the \ntransformation to a high-technology and service-oriented economy. In line with the sector policy \nand  strategy,  ADB  is  investing  in  several  spheres  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  secondary  and  tertiary \neducation,  including  TEVT,  between  2000  and  2010.6  The  earlier  Secondary  Education \nModernization Project (SEMP) and the ongoing Secondary Education Modernization Project II \n(SEMP  II)  have  initiated  support  for  modernizing  secondary  education,  and  teaching  and \nlearning methods, through curriculum revision and enhanced use of ICT in learning, science \nteaching, and reform in school-based assessment (SBA). SEMP II further supports devolution of \neducation  management  through  school-based  management  and  training  in  teaching  and \nlearning  at zonal  level.  At  the  tertiary  level,  the  Distance  Education Modernization  Project \n(DEMP) supports the expansion of tertiary education opportunities through enhanced use of \ndistance education for service delivery, PPP in distance education, and capacity upgrade of the \nOpen University of Sri Lanka (OUSL). The Technical Education Development Project (TEDP) \nsupports  further  upgrading  of  technical  colleges  and  expansion  of  post-A  level  technical \neducation through a new University of Vocational Technology.     \n \n14.  Findings of the Country Assistance Program Evaluation (CAPE)7 show that education \nsector assistance is relevant, efficient, effective, and likely to be sustainable. Outcomes in \nsecondary education are: (i) improved pass rates over the period 2001\u20132006 (para. 2); (ii) \nrelatively high entry to A level (73%) and university (58%) for scholarship recipients under \nSEMP; (iii) higher access to senior secondary level by economically disadvantaged children; (iv) \naccess to ICT in school initiated through 1,000 computer learning centers and school networks, \nand teaching of General Information Technology at O and A level; (v) wider recognition of SBA \nas part of the national assessment; and (vi) strengthened capacity of the National Evaluation \nand Testing Service (NETS). In tertiary education, a 72% employment rate of graduates of ADB- \nassisted Science and Technology institutions was achieved in 2002. Outcomes in TEVT include: \n(i) higher job relevance and self-employment rates of TVET graduates; (ii) an institutionalized \ncompetency-based training system; and (iii) establishment of a National Vocational Qualification \nsystem that offers a career path and alternative avenue to higher education. \n \n15.  Lessons. Besides initial positive sector outcomes, lessons were identified for further \nsystem improvement: (i) because the scope of individual projects is limited, continuous and \n                                                 \n4  ADB.2003.

", "5 \ncomplementary  investments  within  an  overall  sector  assistance  framework  are  needed  to \nmaximize project outputs and accelerate progress in sector outcomes; and (ii) the CAPE and \nother studies further demonstrate that support to implement major policy reforms needs to \ncarefully  consider  the  prevailing  political  economy.  Cost-recovery  in  education,  PPP, \ndecentralization, teacher deployment, and school rationalization are complex policy areas that \nrequire strong and stable political leadership, wider public acceptance, and stronger stakeholder \ncapacity. Long-term project assistance to reform processes through building best practices, \ncontinuous policy dialogue and capacity enhancement will be more effective than ambitious \npolicy-based lending.   \n \n16.  The proposed Project builds upon past project outcomes and complements the ongoing \nprojects in secondary and tertiary education. The ESDFP appropriately addresses the key \nissues in general education. Its themes of equity, quality, efficiency, and good governance are \nconsistent with ADB sector strategies. Therefore, the Project will be integrated into the ESDFP \nand  support  implementation  of  Government  strategies  in  specific  areas.  The  Project  also \nincorporates  support  in  key  policy  reform  areas,  such  as  innovations  for  PPP,  capacity \ndevelopment in education leadership and management, and a mechanism for inter-agency \npolicy dialogue between general education, tertiary education, TEVT, and the private sector. A \nsummary of ADB assistance in the sector in relation to the Project is in Appendix 4.               \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The expected impact of the Project is the increased relevance of secondary and tertiary \neducation to labor market requirements, leading to increased employability of educated youth. \nThe expected outcome of the Project is the improved quality, relevance, effectiveness, and \nequity of access to secondary and tertiary education.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Increased Equity of Access to Education  \n \n18.  Secondary School Upgrading. This component will support the Government strategy \nto upgrade one provincially administered secondary school to a full-fledged school in each of \nthe 325 administrative divisions. The Project will upgrade 150 secondary schools nationwide in \nthe poorest divisions. The selection of the divisions will follow the poverty ranking of the National \nHeadcount Index published by the Department of Census and Statistics. In the absence of \nofficial poverty data available for the Northern Province, data from existing poverty surveys will \nbe used as reference to select the divisions in that province. Furthermore, due to the specific \nchallenges for development in the Northern Province, the selection of the divisions will also \nconsider strategic geographic and demographic areas of development potential. The provincial \nMinistries of Education (PMEs) will finalize the selection of divisions in close partnership with \nMOE. An appropriate number of schools will be selected from the Northern Province, taking into \nconsideration the national demographic balance. The selection of schools will follow criteria that \ntake into account the regional, ethnic, and medium of instruction balance, and the potential of \nthe school to serve a sufficient number of students in the surrounding area. To enhance social \ncohesion, priority will be given to schools that cater to a multi-ethnic student population. Schools \nthat have received support from SEMP II are eligible, provided that there is no duplication of \ninputs.  The  indicative  selection  criteria  and  approval  process  for  upgraded  schools  are  in \nAppendix 5. \n ", " 6 \n \n19.  A Cabinet memorandum specifies that primary school (grades 1\u20135) will be phased out \nfrom the upgraded schools. Children starting grade 1 will attend a primary school close to their \nhomes. These primary schools will be the feeder schools to the upgraded secondary schools in \nthe surrounding area. The selected schools will have multi-purpose teaching facilities, including \nICT facilities with internet connectivity to support CBE teaching methods, particularly in science, \nmathematics and technical subjects including ICT, in grades 10\u201313. A-level commerce and \nscience streams will be offered. In schools with a multi-ethnic student population, instruction will \nbe  provided  in  the  two  official  languages  and  English.  Project  inputs  include  civil  works, \nprovision of equipment, furnishings, and instructional materials. Teacher quarters, water supply, \nand electricity will be provided as required. The Government will ensure that an adequate \nnumber of qualified teachers and a competent principal will be appointed for each school. It will \nalso provide an incentive package for teachers to compensate for serving in remote areas.  \n \n20.  Scholarship  Program.  Scholarships  will  be  awarded  to  needy  children  from  poor \nfamilies  wishing  to  send  children  to  the  upgraded  schools.  Criteria  for  identifying  eligible \nstudents and families will be established using household poverty indicators. Eligible students \nwill receive a scholarship of 10,000 Rupees per year while continuing their studies at the \nupgraded schools or at non-university tertiary level institutions. A total of 30,000 scholarships \nwill be awarded during the Project period. \n   \n2.   Quality and Relevance of Education Enhanced \n \n21.  CBE Curriculum Development. This component will support the National Institute of \nEducation (NIE) in the design and development of a CBE curriculum, instructional materials, \nteaching  methodology  and  assessment  of  learner  competencies,  particularly  in  languages, \nmathematics, sciences, and technical subjects including ICT. PPP will be promoted to make \ncurriculum more responsive to student employability. A quarterly education industry forum for \nCBE development will be organized. The curriculum has been revised for grade 6 and 10. \nRevisions in the grade 7 and 11 curricula will be effective in January 2008, and grades 8 and 9 \nin 2009. Eight full-time staff at NIE specializing in mathematics, sciences, and technical subjects \nwill follow overseas master degree studies. Seven staff will follow master degree studies in Sri \nLanka. One month of international training in current practices for pedagogical applications of \nICT will be provided to 25 staff. Local training programs will be conducted for 60 NIE and NETS \nstaff. Consultancy services will be provided in CBE curriculum development. ICT equipment will \nbe provided to develop capacity for educational software development and for teacher training. \nEquipment and furnishings for multi-purpose workshops will be provided to support teacher \ntraining in 8 technical subjects including agriculture, information technology, civil, mechanical \nand electrical technology, and automotive, refrigeration and food preservation and processing \ntechnology.  \n \n22.  Competency Standards for CBE. The subject syllabi and teacher guides will provide \nteaching methodology, competency standards, and formative evaluation techniques for CBE. \nThe Project will support NIE and NETS to develop competency standards for all secondary \ngrades in languages, mathematics, sciences, and technical subjects, including ICT. A database \nfor the storage of the competency standards will be established. Preparation of user-friendly \ninformation  describing  the  standards  and  their  appropriate  use  will  be  developed,  and \ndistributed to teachers and education administrators. \n \n23.  SBA for CBE. The Project will support the transition towards SBA. It will design and \nimplement  strategies  to  increase  SBA  practices  in  secondary  schools.  Short  term  training ", "7 \nprograms will be conducted for teachers on evaluation of learner performance in CBE. The \nzonal facilitators program for SBA initiated under SEMP II will be strengthened. Record keeping \nand reporting processes for improved classroom management will be introduced. National and \ninternational  professional  development  programs  will  be  provided  to  NIE  and  NETS  staff \nresponsible for CBE evaluation techniques and best practices of SBA.  \n      \n24.  In-Service Teacher Training for CBE. The Project will support the development and \ndelivery of a teacher training program on the integration of ICT in languages, mathematics, \nsciences, and technical subjects. 18 National Colleges of Education (NCOE) and 10 Teacher \nTraining Colleges (TTC) will develop their capacity to provide pre-service and in-service training \nprograms to TC(TC) staff and teachers. In-Service Advisers (ISA) will receive training from NIE. \nAll institutions will provide pre-service and in-service training to teachers from schools in their \nregion. About 360 staff of NCOE/TTC and 200 TC staff will be trained in CBE teaching and \nassessment methods and in applications of ICT for teaching and learning. Teacher training in \nCBE methods, assessment and ICT applications will then be provided to about 18,000 teachers \nthroughout Sri Lanka. NCOEs and TTCs will be provided with basic ICT equipment and media \nprojectors to facilitate the training programs. \n       \n25.  Center of Excellence in English Education (CEIEE). The quality of English teaching \nwill improve with the development of the CEIEE in Peradeniya, which has been upgraded from a \nTTC  into  a  NCOE.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  make  it  the  headquarters  of  English \neducation combining several modes of instructional delivery. CEIEE will develop a series of \ntraining  courses  using  the  latest  advances  in  ICT.  The  Government  has  taken  actions  to \nrefurbish some of the existing facilities. To make the CEIEE a self-sustaining institution, a \nbusiness  plan  was  developed  with  assistance  from  the  United  States  that  describes  the \ngovernance structure, potential markets for English education, and revenues from the provision \nof services. 12 academic staff positions have been approved to complement the existing 6 \nacademic staff.  \n \n26.  The Project will support the refurbishment of selected buildings, provision of furnishings \nand  ICT  equipment  and  staff  development  in  new  instructional  methods.  It  will  support  a \nresidential and distance education program for teachers and other educators of English. A total \nof 7,000 teachers will have improved English competency. One 9-seat passenger van and one \n24-seat  passenger  bus  will  be  provided.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancy  services  in \ndistance and online course delivery methods and learning materials development. This will be \ncomplemented by a long term international expert in English language teaching to be provided \nby the United States Agency for International Development.  \n \n27.  Upgrading of SLIATE. SLIATE provides ND and HND programs in engineering and \nbusiness studies nationwide through 12 Advanced Technological Institutes (ATI). The Project \nwill assist SLIATE institutions to develop into more market-responsive providers of demand-\ndriven, high-quality tertiary education programs. SLIATE institutions are expected to become a \npositive alternative for A level graduates that do not gain admission to the universities. By \nupgrading SLIATE, the Project will complement the DEMP and TEDP, and the World Bank- \nsupported project in undergraduate education in expanding a variety of quality and relevant \ntertiary education opportunities.  \n \n28.  The Project will assist SLIATE in further developing their Strategic Plan 2007\u20132010 for \ngrowth in student enrollment and the expansion of programs. It will upgrade the 12 ATIs by \nfurnishing  selected  classrooms,  labs  and  workshops.  Industry  advisory  councils  will  be \ndeveloped  and  the  curriculum  revised  to  be  more  market  responsive.  The  occupational \n ", " 8 \nstandards provided by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) will be \nused in the curriculum revision. SLIATE has identified new areas of technology identified as \nhighly  demanded  in  the  labor  market  through  annual  reports  of  the  Central  Bank  and  by \nmembers of academic syndicates. New courses will be developed in software engineering, food \ntechnology, aquaculture, horticulture, telecommunications, and construction management. The \nGovernment will ensure that the cadre positions required for program expansion, including \nmanagement of the new courses, will remain available and that recruitment will take place \naccordingly. SLIATE programs will improve through greater access to ICT, revised instructional \nmaterials, and improved capacity of teaching staff. Minor renovations and upgrading of electrical \nservices and installation of local area network cabling for ICT laboratories and student work \nstations will be provided. The Project will strengthen SLIATE administrative capacity through \ndevelopment of a Management Information System (MIS). All SLIATE ATIs will be equipped \nwith  computers  to  support  administrative  functions.  Study  rooms  of  25-student  capacity \nequipped with a minimum of two computers will be provided for each ATI. Local, regional and \ninternational professional development programs for staff will be implemented. Support provided \nunder  the  Project  will  be  complementary  to  the  assistance  provided  by  Kuwait  for  facility \nupgrade, and by Austria and the Netherlands for courses in mechanical, civil, and electronic \nengineering.  \n \n29.  Use of ICT in Learning. The Project will continue supporting the expansion of ICT \neducation as well as the use of ICT in learning in secondary schools. 2,125 type 28 secondary \nschools that have not been supported under SEMP II will be equipped with a minimum of 3 \ncomputers, uninterrupted power supplies and a printer. Teacher training in computer skills and \nthe use of ICT in learning will be conducted. Eligibility criteria for receiving equipment are that \nthe school has: (i) a minimum enrolment of 200 students; (ii) electricity; (iii) a secure weather \nresistant facility to house the computers; (iv) available staff to introduce ICT in school; and (v) \nnot received previous assistance. Schools supported under SEMP and SEMP II will continue to \nbe assisted with learning materials, teacher training and progress monitoring.  \n  \n30.  Initiative for Innovative ICT for Learning (IIIL). The Project will provide funding to \nsmall  or  locally-based  initiatives,  involving  secondary  schools,  community  groups,  and  the \nprivate sector to enhance innovative use of ICT for learning. A maximum of $50,000 for such \nprojects, or smaller sums for enhancement of ongoing school-based initiatives, will be provided. \nProjects proposed by schools are expected to contribute to the achievement of MOE objectives \nto: (i) facilitate grassroots innovation in teaching and learning using ICT; and (ii) promote and \nfacilitate the formation of multi-stakeholder partnerships for the enhancement and/or replication \nof small-scale and community-based initiatives. All public secondary schools will be eligible to \napply for IIIL. Eligibility criteria will be established, the program advertised, and invitations for \nproposals will be released semi-annually. \n \n3.  Improved HIV/AIDS and Health Education  \n \n31.  HIV/AIDS education will be introduced within a comprehensive school health promotion \nprogram that establishes a foundation for understanding the relationships between personal \nbehavior and health. The HIV/AIDS and health education program will take into account the \ndevelopmental levels of different age groups of students and be culturally sensitive. Systematic \nreview of evidence from developing countries has shown that the most effective programs are \nthose that are curriculum-based and led by adults. The target groups will be those studying in \nsecondary schools from grades 6 to 11 and young adults in the NCOEs and TTCs. \n                                                 \n8 Type 2 schools offer classes from grade 1 to 11 (see Appendix 2)  ", "9 \n \n32.  The Project will support: (i) integration of HIV/AIDS and health education into secondary \nschool curricula; (ii) instructional material development and teacher training; and (iii) teacher \nand student support. A multidisciplinary group of subject experts and trainers will be established \nat national level in order to train a core group of trainers at zonal level, who in turn will train and \nsupport the teachers in schools. Zonal resource centers will be established in each zone\u2019s TC. \nThese zonal resource centers will provide interactive self learning material for students to further \ntheir knowledge. The zonal core group of trainers will also use opportunities provided through \nco-curricular activities such as youth clubs and school health clubs to address related issues. \nIndicators will be developed to monitor and evaluate the process, outcome, and impact of the \nprogram. Criteria will be developed and a system of accreditation established to recognize \nschools with good performance. The School Health and Nutrition Unit of the MOE will plan and \ncoordinate  project  implementation  in  partnership  with  NIE  and  the  Ministry  of  Health.  The \nProject will provide civil works for office refurbishment for the School Health and Nutrition Unit of \nMOE  and  the  zonal  resources  centers,  furniture  and  multi-media  equipment  for  the  zonal \nresource  centers,  international  and  local  training,  consultancy  services,  and  operating \nexpenses, such as monitoring and communication costs. This component will be financed under \nan Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant for HIV/AIDS. It will be also supported by a regional \ntechnical assistance financed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.9 \nA description of the HIV/AIDS health education component is in Appendix 6. \n  \n4.  Improved Policy, Governance and Service Delivery  \n \n33.  Senior Level Policy Coordination and Partnership Mechanism. A central mechanism \nfor policy dialogue among senior representatives of general and tertiary education, TEVT and \nthe private sector will be established to improve coordination and partnerships among education \nand training providers. This mechanism will be formally established among MOE, MHE, the \nMinistry of Vocational and Technical Training (MVTT) and private sector representatives. It will \nbe linked with the ongoing policy development process in tertiary education under the National \nEducation  Commission.  The  Project  will  support  research  studies  for  policy  analysis  and \ndevelopment, best education practices, seminars and workshops, international exchanges and \npeer reviews with education policy makers in Asia. The policy coordination mechanism will also \nadvocate and facilitate education partnerships in: (i) curricula; (ii) teacher development; (iii) \nassessment; (iv) service delivery; (v) accreditation; (vi) quality standards and assurance; (vii) \nPPP; (viii) career guidance; and (ix) social marketing. One of immediate actions will be the \nsetting up of the education-industry forum for CBE development. NIE will take the technical \nleadership for such forum in partnership with the private sector. Another area of importance is \nthe Education-Industry Partnership in career guidance. Technical assistance to further elaborate \nthe organizational structure and working mechanism of such an inter-agency policy coordination \nbody will be provided.10  \n \n34.  Integrated Management Information System. A management information system will \nbe designed and implemented to consolidate and integrate education system information. This \nwill include business processes for finance, personnel, planning, student records, resource \nallocation and monitoring, and research functions that will provide reliable data in a timely \nmanner. A secured network operating center will be established. The data communication \nnetwork at MOE will be upgraded. Zonal offices will have improved computer access and data \ncommunication capacity. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Management  and  Leadership  Training.  Education  management  and  leadership \nprograms will be developed and delivered to provincial and zonal officers and school principals. \nThe programs will be conducted through the Center for Education Leadership Development \n(CELD) of NIE. The capacity of CELD will be developed. The Project will support master degree \nstudies for four staff and other opportunities in professional development, such as participation \nin conferences and workshops, to teaching staff at CELD. The Project will support CELD to \nconduct one management training certificate program and one education leadership program. \nThe  instructional  materials  and  methods  will  support  multi-mode  delivery  using  residency, \ndistance education and self-directed learning. Approximately 4,000 education administrators will \nbenefit from the education management certificate program and 200 will obtain a Master degree \nin education leadership through CELD. \n  \n36.  Career Guidance. The Project will support strengthening career guidance through the \ninter-agency coordination mechanism involving MOE, MHE, MVTT and the private sector. A \ncareer guidance committee composed of the Career Guidance Unit of MOE, the Tertiary and \nVocational  Education  Commission,  SLIATE  Director-General,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  the \nFederation of Chambers of Commerce and other industry associations will develop detailed \nannual plans and strategies and oversee implementation. Furthermore, under the Education-\nIndustry  Partnership,  industry  representatives  and  educators  will  jointly  implement  career \nguidance activities in schools, develop a career guidance manual, and train school principals \nand teachers in career guidance. Work of the career guidance committee will be assisted by an \ninternational and a domestic career guidance specialist.  \n \n37.  A  network  of  92  zonal  resource  centers  staffed  and  equipped  to  assist  teachers, \nstudents and parents will be developed. Existing TCs throughout the country will be used for this \npurpose.11 The TCs will be provided with two computers with access to Internet. One full time \nstaff from each province will undergo professional development program leading to a post-\ngraduate diploma in career guidance and vocational counseling. The qualified staff, assisted by \nthe career guidance specialist, will deliver training programs to a minimum of 800 teachers \nassigned to provide career guidance in secondary schools and to 184 TC staff. The career \nguidance committee  will develop a comprehensive career guidance manual and materials, \nincluding a list of available resources, websites and private sector contacts. A website hosted by \nMOE will provide current information to support the planning and delivery of career guidance. \nThe  website  will  give  labor  market  information,  and  link  to  the  Chambers  of  Commerce, \nJobsNet12 and education and training programs available through TEVT and SLIATE networks. \n  \n38.  Social Marketing. The Project will support a social marketing strategy and information \ncampaign to promote change in prevailing attitudes and bias towards admission to university \nand  employment  in  the  public  sector.  A  domestic  social  marketing  specialist  will  assist  in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  a  social  marketing  strategy  and  program.  The  program  will \nincrease awareness of the benefits of various career options, and the institutions providing \nprograms  leading  to  the  selected options.  To  sustain  the  social  marketing  initiative  at  the \nnational and provincial level, the Project will support a minimum of 30 people from MOE and \nPMEs to complete a certificate program in social marketing offered by the OUSL. This social \nmarketing strategy complements the ongoing investment through the TEDP. Private sector \n                                                 \n11  The same teacher center will be used for providing other resources for teacher support such as HIV/AIDS and \nhealth education and serve as multifunction teacher resource centers.   \n12 JobsNet is an on-line and service center-based employment delivery network of the Ministry of Employment and \nLabor. ", "11 \nparticipation in developing the social marketing strategy and campaign will be assured through \nthe social marketing specialist\u2019s participation in the career guidance committee. \n  \nC.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n \n39.  A $15,000,000 grant will support: (i) the scholarship program; (ii) the IIIL; and (iii) the \nHIV/AIDS health education program. The scholarship program will help poor families in sending \ntheir children to the upgraded schools. The IIIL will support grassroots innovation in ICT for \nlearning.  The  HIV/AIDS  health  education  program  of  $5,000,000  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with the criteria outlined in the ADF IX grant program for HIV/AIDS and infectious \ndisease control activities. The grant outputs and outcomes will be carefully monitored through \nregular project review and reporting, the midterm review, and impact studies.  \n   \nD.  Special Features \n \n40.  Education Partnerships. To meet the challenges of the fast changing economy, the \neducation system can no longer rely solely on individual public sector ministries to provide and \nfinance education services. Partnership building with the private sector, local governments, \ncommunities, schools, and among ministries will be a key strategy to improve quality and \nrelevance of education. The Project promotes innovative partnerships in key selected areas: (i) \ncooperation,  and  resource  and  knowledge  sharing  with  the  private  sector  in  curriculum \ndevelopment,  career  guidance,  social  marketing,  training  and  service  delivery  in  ICT  for \nlearning, and in business processes; (ii) with the Ministry of Labor on labor market information \ndissemination;  (iii)  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  on  HIV/AIDS  health  education;  (iv)  multi-\nstakeholder partnerships between schools, communities, and the private sector under the IIIL; \nand (v) partnerships between MOE, PME, zonal offices, and schools to develop and sustain the \nupgraded secondary schools, and enhance bottom up planning and management. The high \nlevel inter-agency policy coordination mechanism established between MOE, MHE, MVTT and \nprivate  sector  representatives  will  be  the  vehicle  to  initiate,  monitor  and  sustain  such \npartnerships. It is expected that in the long-term, education partnerships will be mainstreamed in \nall aspects of education planning, management, financing, and monitoring.  \n    \nE.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n44.  MOE will be the Executing Agency. The project steering committee (PSC) for SEMP II will \nbe enlarged and serve as the PSC for the Project. It will direct the Project, monitor its activities \nand outputs, guide the Project Management Office (PMO), and coordinate and liaise with other \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments.  The  Secretary  of  MOE  will  chair  the  PSC,  whose \nmembers will comprise the Secretary of MHE, representatives of MVTT, MOE, the Finance \nCommission,  the  External  Resources  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National \nPlanning Department, NIE, NETS, PME, the National Education Commission, the Ministry of \nHealth, and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, as well as one Provincial \nDirector of Education on a rotating basis.  \n \n45.  The implementation agencies will be the respective units under MOE, the Provincial \nDepartments of Education, Zonal Education Offices, NIE, CELD, NETS, SLIATE Directorate-\nGeneral  and  SLIATE  Centers,  and  the  NCOE  in  Peradeniya.  Close  coordination  will  be \nmaintained between MOE and MHE for the implementation of the SLIATE sub-component.13 \nPartnership will be initiated between MOE and MHE for the implementation of the HIV/AIDS \nhealth education component through a technical committee. Industry representatives under the \ncoordination  of  the  Federation  of  Chambers  of  Commerce  will  jointly  implement  selected \nactivities. Considering the need to review the capacity of NIE as implementing agency, MOE will \nundertake an institutional audit of NIE prior to project implementation, which will include a \nhuman resources plan with budget allocation. Such audit will be conducted under the ongoing \nSEMP II. A project implementation responsibility matrix is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n  \n46.  A PMO will be responsible for fund management, procurement, and accounting. It will \ncoordinate implementation of project activities by the implementing agencies at all levels. To \nensure project complementarity, SEMP II\u2019s PMO will take responsibilities for the management of \nthe Project, with additional staff required. The current organization consists of a central PMO \nand 8 provincial PMOs. Each office is staffed by a Provincial Project Manager, a secretary, and \na driver. SEMP II is scheduled to be finished by December 2009, while the Project is estimated \nto start in 2008 and end in 2012. There will be a two-year overlap of the projects during 2008-\n2009. The Project will utilize the SEMP II\u2019s PMO during this overlap. Project implementation \ncosts will be assumed by the Project starting in 2010. At SEMP II completion, MOE and ADB \nwill jointly review staff resource requirements and make adjustment as required. \n   \n47.  The  SEMP  II  PMO  will  be  strengthened  to  assume  the  additional  responsibilities, \nincluding  positions  for  a  deputy  project  director,  an  education  specialist,  a  procurement \nspecialist, an accountant, an ICT specialist and 5 management assistants. In addition, a sub-\nunit will be added for the central PMO to work specifically on school upgrading, comprising a \nprogram manager, engineer, architect, 2 technical assistants, a draughtsman, 2 management \nassistants, and a driver. A new Provincial PMO will be established in the Northern Province,14 \ncomprising a Provincial Project Manager, a secretary, a management assistant, and a driver. An \nadditional position for a management assistant will be added to all Provincial PMOs. \n \n                                                 \n13  Due to the recent change in the Cabinet of Ministers, SLIATE, which was previously under the administrative \nsupervision of MOE, has moved under the supervision of MHE.     \n14  Until December 2006, Northern and Eastern provinces were amalgamated in one province.      \n ", " 14 \n48.  The SEMP II PMO has been working in a fully integrated manner with MOE as well as \nwith the Provincial Departments of Education, maintaining regular coordination with the MOE \nPlanning Division as well as with the Planning Division at the Provincial level. The PMO with the \nadditional responsibilities will continue working in the same manner. The PMEs are expected to \nbe fully involved in the selection of secondary schools to be upgraded. MOE\u2019s Planning Division, \nincluding the foreign aid funded project focal point and the Provincial Departments of Education, \nwill ensure that the Project\u2019s contribution to the ESDFP annual planning and budgeting process \nis accurately reflected, and that no duplication of activities with other government or foreign fund \naided activities will occur.    \n \n49.  The Project, including the HIV/AIDS health education component financed under the \ngrant, will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2008 to December 2012. The Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.    \n  \n2.  Procurement \n50.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Each contract for goods and \nservices of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding \nprocedures,  while  contract  packages  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  National \nCompetitive Bidding (NCB). All civil works contracts will be awarded through NCB. Civil works \nprocurement will ensure universal access for the disabled in accordance with the Government \nCircular of 17 October 2006, and will also follow the Central Environment Authority guidelines \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Before the commencement of any procurement activity \nunder NCB, ADB and the Borrower will review the Borrower\u2019s procurement law to ensure \nconsistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Minor  items valued at less than $10,000 \nequivalent will be procured directly following Government procedures. A procurement plan is in \nAppendix 9.  \n   \n3.  Consulting Services  \n \n51.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). A team of consultants will be engaged to provide services in a \nrange of specializations, with estimated international inputs of 69 person-months and national \ninputs of 300 person-months under the loan, and 15 person-months of international inputs and \n54 person-months of national inputs under the grant. The consultants will be engaged through \nfirms using the quality-and cost-based selection method. The quality-cost ratio will be 80:20. \nApproximately 3 international and 4 national consultants will be engaged through individual \nrecruitment. Consultant inputs from the Project will be closely coordinated with those provided \nunder SEMP II and projects assisted by other development partners. A summary of consulting \nservices  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.   \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy   \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the ", "15 \nloan and regulations, and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOE and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The following project-\nspecific anticorruption measures have also been included in the design: (i) under the SEMP II, \nMOE established a complaint investigation and resolution unit within MOE's internal Auditors \nDepartment. The Project will continue to support the use of this unit, including for complaints \nrelated  to  the  award  of  scholarships;  (ii)  detailed  selection  criteria  and  guidelines  for  the \nselection of schools to be upgraded as well as for awarding scholarships and awarding projects \nunder the IIIL will be prepared and agreed upon in the initial stage of project implementation, \nthus discouraging abuse during the subsequent selection processes; (iii) regular disclosure of \nproject-related  information  through  the  MOE  web  page  and  school  net15  to  increase \ntransparency, accountability, and efficiency; (iv) six-monthly review of fiduciary issues, inclusive \nof financial management and audit findings and sample checks of statements of expenditure; \nand  (v)  annual  financial  audit  and  capacity  development  to  be  undertaken  by an  external \nfinancial auditor appointed by the Auditor-General and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n53.  MOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  for  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. To ensure the timely release of loan and grant \nfunds, two imprest accounts (one for the loan and another for the grant) will be established in \nthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The initial amount will be no more than 6 months projected \ndisbursements  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  or  grant  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest \naccounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures \nmay be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest \naccounts in accordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \nMOE will coordinate the timely release of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of \nthe imprest accounts and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the \nannual audit report.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n54.  The Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify goods and services financed from the loan and grant proceeds. MOE will maintain \nseparate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial \nstatements are audited annually by independent auditors appointed by the Auditor-General and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan and grant proceeds, \ncompliance  with  project  covenants,  and  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  under  ADB\u2019s  SOE \nprocedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 9 months after the close of the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal year. MOE will ensure that recommendations of the annual external audit \nare implemented accordingly.  \n \n                                                 \n15 School net is a wide-area network of more than 1,000 senior secondary schools and other educational institutions, \ninitiated under the Secondary Education Modernization Project.     \n ", " 16 \n55.  The PMO will prepare quarterly reports on the progress of project implementation and \nsubmit them to ADB and MOE within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate (i) progress made against established targets, (ii) status of \nperformance  indicators,  (iii)  problems  encountered  and  actions  taken  to  address  them, \n(iv) compliance with project covenants, and (v) proposed program of activities for the following \nquarter. Within 3 months after project physical completion, the Government will submit to ADB a \nproject  completion  report  describing  project  implementation,  accomplishments,  benefits, \nimpacts, costs, and compliance with project covenants. \n   \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n56.  To ensure efficient project implementation, the Government will prepare and provide \nADB with the next fiscal year\u2019s project operational plan at least 30 days before the start of the \nnext fiscal year. The operational plan will include: (i) project activities with cost estimates and \nperformance targets proposed for each component/subcomponent; (ii) a plan for complying with \noutstanding project covenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial requirements, including loan and \ngrant proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; and (iv) details of how \nproject activities will be integrated into the ESDFP\u2019s annual plan and budget.  \n \n57.  MOE will establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring and evaluation \nsystem acceptable to ADB. Project monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of MOE \nthrough  the  PMO.  Within  the  first  6  months  of  implementation,  a  baseline  study  will  be \nconducted to refine and expand verifiable indicators of project inputs, outputs, and outcomes. \nData will be segregated by gender and ethnicity.   \n \n8.  Project Review   \n58.  The Government and ADB will jointly review the Project\u2019s progress at least twice a year. \nBesides regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review \nduring the Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the project scope, design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity-building  processes;  \n(ii) review any changes in the Government\u2019s policies and institutional framework since appraisal \nand  evaluate  their  impact  on  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii)  assess  project \nimplementation against appropriate projections/performance indicators; (iv) review compliance \nwith loan covenants; (v) identify critical issues and constraints; and (vi) recommend changes in \nproject design or implementation as needed. The midterm review will specifically assess the \nequity of resource distribution across regions, gender, ethnicity, and medium of instruction of all \nproject components and make adjustments if required. The status of project implementation in \nthe conflict-affected areas, including the Project quota for schools in the Northern Province (see \npara. 65) will be also assessed. Adjustments will be made in project scope or implementation \narrangements as necessary.       \n   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts  \n \n59.  Sectoral Benefits and Impact. The Project will benefit primary and secondary school \nstudents in the 150 poorest administrative divisions. The upgraded schools will provide higher \nquality teaching in key subjects of sciences, English, ICT, and technical subjects. This will widen \nthe students\u2019 options for tertiary education, and ultimately their career paths. Reform in CBE will \nmake education more outcomes-based, and thus more practical. Expansion of SBA will make ", "17 \nassessment more comprehensive and less centered on national examinations. Greater use of \nICT for learning will diversify and enrich both teaching and learning. Enhanced linkages with \nindustry will help students understand the world of work. Capacity enhancement of school \nprincipals  and  education  administrators  will  improve  management  efficiency.  Upgrading  of \nSLIATE will expand tertiary education opportunities in all provinces. Education partnerships will \nhave a positive institutional impact, helping the system to be more responsive to diversified \nneeds, securing more resources to education, and promoting a holistic view of the entire sector. \nAll Project interventions will contribute to the knowledge-based society which the Government \nenvisions. Ultimately, education content, methodology, service delivery and governance will \nimprove and become more relevant to the needs of the modern economy and society.  \n \n60.  Economic Benefit. Improved quality and relevance, and increased access to secondary \nand  tertiary  education  will  lead  to  increased  internal  and  external  efficiency.  Increased \nparticipation and completion rates at secondary and tertiary level will reduce education wastage \nand reduce burden on public expenditure. Availability of a skilled labor force in key sectors of \nthe economy will contribute to national economic growth, which in turn will create more jobs for \nthe educated youth. A summary of the project demand and economic analysis is in Appendix \n11, and detailed analysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n61.  Social  Benefits  and  Poverty  Impact.  The  upgrading  of  secondary  schools  in  the \npoorest  administrative  divisions  will  yield  positive  benefits  to  children  in  disadvantaged \ncommunities. Access to teaching in key subjects such as sciences, mathematics, English, ICT, \nand technical subjects will help these children breaking into better incomes and employment \nperspectives. As the proportion of schools to benefit from the Project\u2019s interventions will follow \nthe School Census Data, equity among Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim students will be ensured. \nAffirmative  action  to  address  weakness  in  English  teaching  in  Tamil  medium  schools  will \nespecially benefit Tamil medium students. Expansion of tertiary education opportunities through \nSLIATE will also increase access to higher skills upgrade by poor students from all ethnic \ngroups, leading to better jobs in local and foreign markets. Ultimate success of the secondary \nschool upgrade could result in reestablishment of local communities as children presently forced \nto attend secondary school in urban areas will have access to an upgraded school closer to \nhome. Development of multi-ethnic and multi-lingual schools will promote better multi-ethnic \nunderstanding. Overall, a more socially inclusive education system will reduce social tension \nand enhance social cohesion among different ethnic groups. The Summary Poverty Reduction \nand Social Strategy is in Appendix 12. An Ethnic Equity Framework (EEF) is in Appendix 13. \n \nB.  Project Risks   \n    \n62.  Sustainability of Project Investment. Lessons identified from earlier projects show a \nrisk that facilities of the institutions upgraded under projects may not be maintained after project \ncompletion. The Government has assured that sufficient recurrent cost will be provided to \nmaintain the facilities financed under the Project. Furthermore, cost-recovery measures and \nbusiness plans have been developed for the upgrading of SLIATE institutions, the CEIEE, and \nthe CELD. There is also a risk that the upgraded schools may fail to secure an adequate \nnumber of qualified teachers. Therefore, disbursement conditions ensure that no funds for the \nupgrading of any school will be disbursed unless the school has prepared a time-bound plan for \nthe selection and deployment of the needed teachers and principal, and until MOE and PME \nhave allocated the requested cadre. All cadre positions thus allocated will be filled prior to the \ndisbursement of any funds required for the implementation of the Project operation plan of the \nsubsequent year for that particular school. \n \n ", " 18 \n63.  Institutional  Capacity.  Performance  of  earlier  projects  demonstrates  the  adequate \nimplementation capacity of MOE as EA. An adequate number of additional staff will be hired for \nSEMP II\u2019s PMO to implement the Project. Close monitoring and guidance from ADB will be \nprovided to SEMP II\u2019s PMO in handling multiple project accounts. Experience under SEMP \nraises concern over shortage of staff of NIE and its implementation capacity. NIE will ensure \nthat its vacancies related to curriculum development will be filled with an appropriate mixture of \ncandidates  with  considerable  experience  in  teaching  in  a  particular  subject,  and  graduate \ncandidates that are up-to-date with the latest findings and trends in such subject. Furthermore, \nan institutional audit, including a human resources plan with budget allocation will be conducted \nand a sufficient number of allocated vacancies filled before project activities at NIE start. \n  \n64.  Safeguard  Measures.  The  Project  will  not  cause  displacement  of  any  families  or \nhouseholds as civil works are limited to existing school property and the renovation of existing \nSLIATE  and  CEIEE  buildings.  In  the  event land  acquisition  is  required,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  will  be  followed.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  a \nResettlement  Framework.  No  adverse  environmental  impact  is  anticipated.  Civil  works  will \nfollow country specific environmental guidelines and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Disposal \nof hazardous chemicals that may be used during science classes will be consistent with the \nhandling and safe disposal measures already employed in the secondary schools in the country.  \n  \n65.  Conflict Sensitivity. The Project will ensure that all target beneficiaries gain access to \nresources provided by the Project irrespective of gender, ethnicity, and geographic location. \nHowever,  peace  and  security  concerns  may  affect  activities  in  the  conflict-affected  areas. \nTherefore, the Project will build maximum flexibility in its implementation to ensure that children \nin those areas are not excluded from the benefits of the Project. For instance, for the upgrading \nof secondary schools, if in any given year selected schools from the Northern Province cannot \nbe upgraded due to security concerns, those schools will be replaced in that year with schools \nfrom another province, but the overall project quota for schools to be upgraded in the Northern \nProvince will not change. Furthermore, reallocation of funds among schools within the Northern \nProvince will be agreed between MOE and ADB. Refurbishment of schools in the conflict-\naffected areas will only take place with the assurances of a return to peace and security. All \nupgrading and development work will be done with people from the area. Close monitoring of \nsecurity conditions will mitigate risks. Local labor will be used for civil works. The status of \nproject  implementation  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  will  be  assessed  periodically  and \nadjustment made in project scope or implementation arrangements as necessary.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n66.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurance,  the  Government  and  MOE  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a coordination mechanism between the \nMOE,  MHE,  MVTT,  and  the  private  sector  will  be  established,  aiming  at \nharmonizing  policies  for  the  broader  education  sector,  and  promoting  multi-\nstakeholder education partnerships in key policy reform areas. \n(ii)  The  selection  of  schools  to  be  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  be  done  in \naccordance with the selection criteria and the procedures agreed between MOE \nand ADB and taking into account geographical distribution. In the first year, \napproximately 60 schools will be selected, and about 60 schools every year \nthereafter, up to a maximum of 150 schools. If in any given year selected schools \nfrom the Northern Province cannot be upgraded due to security concerns, those ", "19 \nschools will be replaced in that year with schools from another province, but the \noverall project quota for schools to be upgraded from the Northern Province will \nnot  change.  Furthermore,  reallocation  of  funds  among  schools  within  the \nNorthern Province will be agreed between MOE and ADB.  \n(iii)  Throughout  Project  implementation  and  after  Project  completion,  the \nGovernment  will  allocate  sufficient  funds  from  its  budget  to  maintain  an \nacceptable level of operation and maintenance of schools, including for (1) the \navailability  of  water,  sanitation,  and  utilities;  (2)  maintenance  and  repair  of \ncomputers; and (3) salaries of teachers, principals, and support staff. \n(iv)  Within 12 months of the effectiveness date, MOE will have reviewed and updated \nthe action plans, including incentives and disincentives, for teacher transfer to \nrural and disadvantaged areas that were prepared under SEMP II. \n(v)  All scholarships will be awarded in accordance with the criteria and guidelines \ndeveloped  for  the  selection  and  management  of  scholarships,  which  will  be \nprepared within 6 months of loan effectiveness. The guidelines will include a \ncomplaint and grievance procedure. \n(vi)  At the latest by the midterm review during the Project\u2019s third year, MOE will have \nconducted an impact and tracer study of the scholarship program. \n(vii)  MOE will ensure that all required allocated positions for the CEIEE will be filled \nprior to the commencement of the respective training program.  \n(viii)  The SLIATE centers to be upgraded under the Project will be selected in such a \nway as to ensure geographical distribution. The upgrading of any SLIATE center \nshall be in line with the SLIATE Strategic Plan 2007\u20132010, as may be updated \nfrom time to time.  \n(ix)  MOE and MHE will ensure that the revision of SLIATE\u2019s curriculum will be done \nin accordance with appropriate occupational standards. \n(x)  MOE and MHE will ensure that cadre positions required for SLIATE\u2019s program \nexpansion, including management of the new courses, will remain available and \nthat recruitment will take place within 12 months of loan effectiveness. \n(xi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the CELD will be established as a center \nunder the NIE Act.  \n(xii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line \nwill be installed at the CELD. \n(xiii)  MOE and MHE will ensure that any staff from NIE, CELD, CEIEE, and SLIATE \ncenters who participate in a training course of more than one month will have \nsuitable replacements prior to starting the course.   \n(xiv)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established the \nInitiative for Innovative ICT for Learning (IIIL) including operating rules, guidelines \nand selection criteria acceptable to ADB.  \n(xv)  MOE  will  ensure  that  all  candidates  for  local  and  international  training  and \nfellowships will be selected in accordance with criteria agreed upon between the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning and ADB. All efforts will be made to retain staff \nwho  have  participated  in  such  international  training  and  fellowships  at  their \nrespective institutions, in accordance with existing regulations. \n(xvi)  MOE will ensure that the social marketing campaign will be conducted in the two \nofficial languages as well as in English.  \n(xvii)  MOE will ensure that the Project will be implemented in accordance with the \nEthnic Equity Framework and the Gender Strategy.  \n(xviii)  MOE ensures that all facilities under the Project to be extended or upgraded will \nbe located on land owned by the Government, and that no displacement or \nresettlement of people, including squatters, will be involved.

The Education System and its Outcomes  \n \n1.  General education consists of primary (grades 1\u20135), junior secondary (grades 6\u20139), and \nsenior secondary education (grades 10\u201313). Tertiary education is open to those who pass the \ngeneral certificate advanced level (A-level) national examination after grade 13. It consists of \npublic  universities,  nondegree  private  institutions,  private  institutions  affiliated  with  foreign \nuniversities,  National  Colleges  of  Education  (NCOE),  the  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Advanced \nTechnological Education (SLIATE), and technical colleges. Currently, only public universities \ncan award degrees. Entry to technical and vocational education (TEVT) starts at grade 11 upon \npassing the general certificate ordinary level (O-level) national examination. Sri Lanka has three \ncategories of secondary schools: (i) type 1AB schools offer classes from grades 1\u201313 with A-\nlevel options in commerce, arts, and science; (ii) type 1C schools offer classes from grades 1\u2013\n13 with A-level arts and commerce only, and (iii) type 2 schools offer classes from grades 1\u201311 \nin preparation for O-level examinations. Type 1AB schools are generally located in urban areas, \nwhile type 1C and 2 schools are normally situated in semi urban and rural areas. Type 3 \nschools offer primary grades 1\u20135. Approximately 71% and 29% of schools use Sinhala and \nTamil as the language of instruction, respectively. English is considered a link language and \nsome schools provide instruction in English.  \n  \n2.  In 2006, primary school completion rates were 91% for boys and 94% for girls. In junior \nsecondary, grade 6 enrollment is about 90% of the age cohort. The completion rate declines at \ngrade 9 to about 84%. O-level and A-level pass rates improved between 2001 and 2006, from \n37%  to  49%  for  O  level,  and  50%  to  60%  for  A  level.  However,  pass  rates  in  science, \nmathematics, and English remain lower than the average. Many of those who fail O-level exams \nrepeat the test. Students who pass the O-level exam generally continue to the A level. A-level \ngraduates compete for university and other tertiary education institutions, but the system has \nsuch limited intake capacity that only about 11% of those who qualify are admitted to tertiary \neducation institutions. Others seek higher skill upgrading opportunities in TEVT. Although the \nquality and relevance of TEVT programs have gradually improved, they offer limited options for \nschool leavers with O- and A-level qualifications. As a consequence, many educated youth are \nunemployed. Despite remarkable attainment in primary education and gradual improvement in \nsecondary education, bottlenecks entering tertiary institutions, including TEVT, undermine the \nachievement and efficiency gained in primary education.   \n \nB.  Sector Needs and Challenges \n  \n  1.  Relevance and Quality of Education \n  \n3.  Student  Competencies.  Stakeholder  consultations  with  industry  representatives \nidentified a key issue to be school graduates\u2019 lack of generic skills and attitudes required in the \nworkplace, such as communications, team work, problem solving, and critical thinking. As the \nschool system has been traditionally oriented to university admission, education content and \nteaching  methodologies  remain  theoretical,  rigid,  and  subservient  to  passing  the  national \nexaminations. Despite several attempts to introduce activity-based learning, the traditional rote \nlearning process has not seen significant changes.  \n \n4.  In 2006, the Ministry of Education (MOE) issued a directive to change the secondary \nschool curriculum and teaching methods to competency-based education (CBE). The purpose \nof  the  curriculum  reform  was  to  increase  effective  teaching  and  learning  to  develop  core ", "Appendix 2         27 \ncompetencies in communication, problem solving, and team work. The learner-centered CBE \napproach  is  intended  to  provide  practical  applications  to  reinforce  the  theoretical  content. \nSchool-based formative assessment of learner performance is an integral part of CBE. The bold \nreforms in curriculum, instruction, and evaluation intend to transform the Sri Lanka education \nsystem to be more responsive to present and future needs. Responsibility for implementing the \nreform was given to the National Institute of Education (NIE), which is responsible for curriculum \ndesign and oversight of teacher education.  \n \n5.  The  Right  Options.  Science  and  technology,  information  and  communication \ntechnology (ICT), and English are considered key study areas that prepare students for better \nemployment opportunities. The challenge is to expand quality teaching and learning in these \nareas with the appropriate facilities, equipment, tools, and qualified teachers, so that students \ncan select the best options. ICT is not only an important subject in itself. Moreover, it can be an \neffective multimedia tool for subject learning that enriches learning content and methods, thus \ncontributing to student\u2019s better mastery of the subject. The eight optional technical subjects at A \nlevel (agriculture; information technology; and civil, mechanical and electrical, automotives, \nrefrigeration, and food preservation and processing technologies) are also important, either as \nprevocational subjects or as subjects that add practical knowledge and skills to core subject \nlearning. However, the shortage of teachers with appropriate training impedes the availability of \nthese optional technical subjects.  \n   \n6.  Tertiary  Education.  In  addition  to  the  14  universities,  SLIATE,  NCOEs,  and  the \ntechnical colleges, numerous private institutions and 21 ministries ranging from the Ministry of \nTourism  to  the  Ministry  of  Transport  offer  nondegree  tertiary  education.  Because  public \nresource  constraints  limit  the  expansion  of  universities,  these  nonconventional  public  and \nprivate tertiary education institutions will play a greater role in providing a positive alternative for \nA-level graduates who wish to pursue upgrading of skills before seeking employment. These \ninstitutions typically offer diplomas and high national diplomas in selected professional fields. \nThe immediate task is to upgrade a selected number of these institutions to more market-\nresponsive and high-quality tertiary education providers. The future task would be to establish a \nregulatory framework that regulates and facilitates their expansion, and provide them with a \nquality assurance mechanism.  \n \n7.  TEVT. TEVT comprises a mixture of planned and unplanned programs promoted by the \nGovernment, the private sector, and nongovernment organizations, mostly targeting school \nleavers with O- and A-level qualifications. The major achievements in TEVT today are better \nplanning and a better subsector structure that replaced earlier ad hoc interventions: (i) an \ninstitutionalized competency-based training system, and (ii) a national vocational qualification \nsystem that offers a career path and alternative avenue to higher education. That attainment led \nto higher job relevance and self-employment rates of TEVT graduates. The future task is to \nexpand  high-quality  TEVT  programs  in  selected  sectors  that  are  in  high  demand  by  the \neconomy and to establish effective mechanisms to ensure the quality of many private providers \nof training.  \n \n  2.   Equity of Access  \n \n8.  Free Education. Before independence (1949), the dual system of education included \nfee-levying  English  schools  and  non-fee-levying  Sinhala  and  Tamil  schools.  Government \nexpenditure on education was biased in favor of urban English schools, while schools in rural \nareas were largely neglected. After independence, various initiatives were introduced to correct \nthe inequities through educational reforms implemented to improve conditions, particularly in \n ", "28         Appendix 2 \n \n \nremote and rural areas, and for children from disadvantaged groups. The reforms included free \neducation from grade 1 to the completion of the first university degree, instruction using the \nmother  tongue,  provision  of  free  textbooks,  free  midday  meals  in  primary  and  secondary \nschools, subsidized transport, and free uniforms. Sri Lanka\u2019s success in achieving universal \nprimary education is largely due to thorough reforms that meet the socioeconomic, cultural, and \nlinguistic factors that constrain the demand for education among the poor.  \n      \n9.  Supply of Education. Many children of poor families or in marginalized communities \nhave access to schools, but in many cases the quality is poor. In recent years, the quality gap \nhas increased between the education available in more affluent areas and that in many remote \nlocations including the plantation sector and conflict-affected areas. Despite Government efforts \nto address inequity in supply of good quality education, the colonial model of preferential status \nfor  a  relatively  small  number  of  selected  national  schools  and  inadequate  support  for  the \nmajority of provincial schools continues to dominate education governance and development. \nUneven deployment of teachers in the country contributes to the regional imbalances in the \nquality of education. High demand by teachers to be assigned to popular urban schools has \ngenerally led to an oversupply in urban areas and shortfall of teachers in rural schools. The \nshortage of teachers is acute in disadvantaged rural areas, the plantation sector, the conflict-\naffected areas, and Tamil teachers teaching English and science. \n  \n10.  Furthermore, in Northern and Eastern provinces, the escalation of armed conflict during \nthe last two decades has had considerable impact on education through structural damage to \nschools, closures of schools, and displacement of pupils and teachers. As of January 2007, the \ntwo provinces had more than 26,000 displaced students and approximately 1,000 displaced \nteachers. Displacement of teachers and students has led to partial or complete disruption of \neducation in some of the most affected areas. \n \n11.  As children attending urban schools with good learning conditions have a better chance \nof passing national examinations and entering tertiary education, inequity in supply of quality \nprimary and secondary education leads to inequity in tertiary education. The net enrollment rate \nof children in grades 10\u201313 from families in the lowest income quintile is approximately half the \nrate for the richest quintile. For tertiary education, the disparities widen even more: the net \nenrollment rate for the richest quintile is 13% compared to 2% for the poorest quintile. Overall, \nthe lack of supply of good education undermines efforts to provide free education to needy \nfamilies and children. \n      \n  3.  Management Efficiency \n   \n12.  Decentralization. In 1987, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution introduced \ngovernance  reform  devolving  authority  for  the  local  administration  and  management  of \neducation to the nine provinces. The legislation was well intended, timely, and sound, but \nimplementation has been slow. The role of MOE is to set education policy and oversee the \nentire  education  system  in  cooperation  with  provincial  ministries  of  education.  Authority  to \nadminister and operate all public primary and secondary schools is delegated to the nine \nprovinces, except for the 324 national schools administered directly by MOE. Although these \nnational schools represent only 3.3% of all schools, they enroll 20% of the students.1 The \nprovincial governance model includes approximately 10 educational zones per province for a \ntotal of 92 zonal education offices. The zones are further divided into 325 divisional secretariat \ndivisions, and finally the 9,727 schools.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Department of Census and Statistics. 2004. School Census. Colombo.   ", "Appendix 2         29 \n13.  The  double  standard  of  education  governance  that  distinguishes  between  national \nschools administered directly by MOE and provincial schools administered by the provincial \nministries  of  education  impedes  the  efficiency  of  education  governance.  Inadequate \nmanagement capabilities at various levels of administration are linked to frequent changes in \nthe  management  systems,  political  influence  over  resource  allocation  and  personnel \nappointments, and centralized decision-making. School-based management was introduced to \nimprove  school  governance  and  quality  of  teaching  through  bottom-up  planning  and \nmanagement. However, managerial capacity and leadership of school principals and provincial \nand zonal education officers need to improve, including effective supervision and monitoring. \nMOE initiated establishment of quality assurance, however more efforts are needed to expand it \nat the school level. \n       \n4.  Education Financing \n  \n14.  Sri Lanka\u2019s public expenditure on education as a percentage of its gross domestic \nproduct has increased from 2.6% in 2005 to 3% in 2007. As the sector has to compete with a \nbroad  range  of  public  services,  the  education  budget  cannot  increase  drastically  unless \nexpenditures  in  other  sectors  such  as  defense  decrease.  MOE  directly  finances  national \nschools. The provincial schools are partly financed by the provincial councils and partly by MOE \nas a block grant for the capital budget. As education is free up to the first university degree, it \nrelies heavily on public resources. The impact of budgetary constraints on access, quality, and \nrelevance of education is seen in both the capital and recurrent budgets. Restrictions in the \ncapital  budget  constrain  investment  in  physical  expansion  of  school  facilities  such  as \nclassrooms, sanitation, laboratories, and libraries. Provincial schools in rural areas particularly \nsuffer.  Recurrent  budget  accounts  for  about  80%  of  public  expenditure  in  education.  As \napproximately  85%\u201390%  is  used for  salaries,  little  is  left  for  quality  improvement  such  as \nprofessional development for teachers, supervision and monitoring, and quality maintenance of \nexisting facilities. As such, equity of access to, and quality and relevance of education cannot be \nmaintained  or  enhanced  without  cost  recovery  measures  and  cost  sharing.  Public-private \npartnerships  in  service  delivery  will  be  a  viable  means  to  lessen  the  burden  on  public \nexpenditure, especially in secondary education and above. For instance, greater cost sharing in \ntertiary education among nonpoor students would save on public expenditure in education, \nwhich in turn can be used to improve quality of service delivery at lower levels of education. \nHowever, wider public acceptance of public-private partnerships in areas traditionally dominated \nby the public sector, such as general education and tertiary education, remains a key challenge. \n \nC.  Policy Issues: Progress, Challenges, and Alternative Solutions \n  \n15.

The criteria for selecting one secondary school in each of the 325 divisional secretary \ndivisions (DSDs) to be upgraded (the upgraded school) are derived from Cabinet Memorandum \nNo. 2006/ED/E/37. In addition to the Government criteria, selection of the 150 schools to \nreceive funding through the Project will be determined using the following criteria:  \n \n(i)  The school is and will continue to be administered by the provincial education \nauthority and not be classified as a national school.  \n \n(ii)  Eligible schools will either be type 1C or type 2. In DSDs where a type 1AB \nschool exists but is assessed as no longer fully functional and satisfies all other \nselection criteria, it may be considered eligible for upgrading.     \n \n(iii)  The DSD is ranked among the poorest 150 of the 325 DSDs based on the \nnational headcount index1 prepared by the Department of Census and Statistics,2 \nSri  Lanka.  Selection  of  DSDs  in  the  Northern  Province  will  be  determined \nseparately, due to the absence of data for many DSDs in the province. Taking \ninto consideration the national demographic balance3, approximately six schools \nwill be selected in each of the five districts in the Northern Province. Due to the \nspecific challenges for development in the province, the selection of the divisions \nwill also consider strategic geographic and demographic areas of development \npotential. In the conflict-affected areas, the selection of schools to be upgraded \nwill take into account the security and safety conditions in the region. \n  \nThe scheduling priority for selecting the divisions and developing the schools will \nbegin with the poorest DSDs in all provinces. \n   \n(iv)  A minimum of five type 3 schools and three type 2 or type 1C schools will be \nwithin  the  specified  catchment  area.4  A  projection  of  the  student  population \nbased  on  demographic  data  combined  with  analysis  of  projected  student \nincreases  from  feeder  schools  will  indicate  positive  increases  in  future \nenrollment.  \n  \n(v)  Priority will be given to a school located in an area with Sinhala and Tamil \nmedium feeder schools in the catchment area. The upgraded school will be \nmultilingual. The proportion for equitable distribution of school development per \nlanguage of instruction will be determined according to the school census data \n(2006). \n      \n(vi)  At least 6,000 children under 18 must reside in the catchment area.5  \n     \n(vii)  Present enrollment in the school to be upgraded is a minimum of 250 students in \nthe primary grades (1\u20135) and 200 in junior secondary school (grades 6\u20139). \n                                                 \n1  National headcount index is the percentage of population living below the poverty line deemed appropriate for the \ncountry by its authorities. Currently, data does not include Northern Province.  \n2 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. 20 June 2005 (Available: www.statistics.gov.lk). \n3 Out of 25 districts, 5 districts are in Northern Province.  \n4  The catchment area is defined as a 10 kilometer radius (approximately 80 square kilometers) around the school.  \n5 National population census and school census data will be used as the basis of the analysis.  ", "Appendix 5          37           \n    \n(viii)  Recruitment,  appointment,  and  deployment  of  the  school  principal  will  be  a \npublicly announced competition. The criteria for selecting the most appropriate \ncandidate include:   \n(a)  a minimum of 5 years experience as principal in the selected school for \nupgrading or in schools of similar capacity; \n(b)  a  record  of  performance  as  principal  including  positive  references  to \nmanaging teachers and nonteaching staff; overseeing maintenance and \nupkeep of school buildings, grounds, and equipment; good rapport with \nstudents; and involvement of parents in school planning and activities; \n(c)  a pattern of increased student enrollment in schools administered by the \nprincipal; \n(d)  improved student performance as shown through pass rates in school-\nbased assessments and in various exams; \n(e)  preparation  of  quality  school  development  plans  and  a  positive \nassessment of the results of plan implementation; and  \n(f)  demonstrated competency in the allocation and use of school funds. \n \n(ix)  Access roads to and from the school are suitable for year-round transportation by \ncar, bus or heavy delivery vehicle. \n  \n(x)  Public transportation is available for students living more than 4 kilometers away \nfrom the selected school.   \n \n(xi)  Sufficient land and space is available for school expansion without disrupting the \nenvironment, appropriation of adjacent properties, displacement of people, or \nnegative effect on peoples\u2019 lives and livelihood. \n  \n(xii)  The existing supply of potable water is sufficient to satisfy increased consumption \nor drilling a deep tube well to access a satisfactory water supply is possible.  \n  \n(xiii)  A system of wastewater treatment exists but may require upgrading. \n  \n(xiv)  An adequate and reliable supply of electricity is available in the school or the \nsupply from power lines no more than 500 meters from the school buildings can \nbe upgraded.  \n \n(xv)  Telephone service connection is available in the school or may be installed from \nlines and switch cabinet located within 500 meters of school buildings. \n \n(xvi)  The  school  should  have  existing  classrooms  made  available  or  other  space \nsuitable for conversion to science labs and activity rooms.   \n \n(xvii)  Library  facilities  with  a  minimum  collection  of  100  library  books  and  other \nmaterials exist.  \n \n(xviii)  A playground or sports field should exist.

The procedures are as follows: \n \n(i)  Identification  of  the  most  eligible  school  will  be  completed  by  a  selection \ncommittee  with  representation  from  the  provincial  and  zonal  structural \ncommittees, the zonal director of education, and director of planning. The zonal \ndirector  will  chair  the  committee  and  ensure  minutes  are  recorded  for  all \nmeetings. Decision of the committee will be by consensus. The committee will \nconsult closely with the Ministry of Education. The identified school should obtain \nthe Divisional Development Committee clearance. \n \n(ii)  The selection committee will prepare a report and recommendation for the school \nthat best matches the selection criteria. A summary explanation indicating how or \nwhy the selected school meets the selection criteria is to be included in the \nwritten report and recommendation. A map of the DSD showing the location of \nthe  selected  school  and  the  location  of  all  other  schools  (including  tertiary \neducation institutions) in the catchment area will be attached. The map should be \nto scale or should otherwise indicate the distance in kilometers to feeder schools \nin the catchment area.     \n    \n(iii)  The  divisional  secretary  must  endorse  the  recommendation  of  the  selection \ncommittee.  \n \n(iv)  The recommendation must be endorsed by the provincial director of education of \nthe provincial council.  \n \n(v)  The recommendation may only be rejected by the Secretary of Education, of the \nMinistry of Education if the minimum criteria are not fully achieved. ", "Appendix 6          39           \n \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND IX GRANT FOR HIV/AIDS HEALTH EDUCATION \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n1.  Sri Lanka remains a country with a low prevalence of HIV1 infection. However, several \nfactors increase vulnerability of the population to an impending epidemic. Successful prevention \nthrough improved knowledge, attitudes, and practices is a preventative approach to reduce risk \nof infection and disease. Children and youth are among the most vulnerable and at the same \ntime represent a captive audience to access health-related information. Furthermore, to realize \nthe full potential of the country\u2019s massive investment in education, schooling should ensure that \nthose who pass through the system acquire sufficient knowledge, skills, and attitudes to remain \nhealthy  and  productive  throughout  life.  The  HIV/AIDS  health  education  component  will \ncomplement previous and ongoing efforts of the Government and other development agencies \nproviding assistance in the health sector.   \n \n2.  Systematic review of health education literature including evaluations and lessons from \ndeveloping countries has shown that the most effective programs are curriculum-based and led \nby adults. Reports on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted disease education indicate such \nprograms can be introduced and best achieved within a comprehensive school health promotion \nstrategy that establishes a foundation for understanding the relationships between personal \nbehavior and good health. The most effective programs take into consideration the physiological \nand emotional developmental levels of the different age groups and must be culturally sensitive \nand appropriate in delivery.   \n \nB.  Objective  \n \n3.  The objective of the HIV/AIDS health education component is to provide adolescents \nand youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to adopt responsible, culturally acceptable, \nand safe reproductive behavior for a healthy and productive life. To achieve the objectives, the \nProject will design, develop, and introduce HIV/AIDS health education as an integral part of the \nsecondary school curriculum and co-curricular activities for grades 6 to 11. To successfully \nimplement the revised curriculum, a minimum of 300 teacher educators at the National Colleges \nof Education (NCOE), teacher training colleges (TTC), and teacher centers (TC) will be the first \nof three beneficiary groups to be trained. The second group is approximately 6,000 teachers in \ntype 1AB, 1C, and type 2 schools. The third and ultimate target group will be all boys and girls \nstudying in grades 6\u201311. Project components will include (i) integration of HIV/AIDS health \neducation into the school curriculum; (ii) learning material development and teacher training, \nand (iii) teacher and student support.   \n \nC.   Project Activities  \n \n  1.  Integration of HIV/AIDS Health Education into the School Curriculum \n \n4.  Several subjects in the curriculum are well suited to include knowledge about growth and \ndevelopment of children as they enter secondary school. Girls and boys in junior secondary \nschool are at the appropriate developmental stage to learn about the importance of good health, \nappropriate behavior, personal hygiene, proper nutrition, and community health. The physical \nand  emotional  development  of  adolescents  brings  a  maturity  leading  to  subjects  such  as \nreproductive  health,  sexuality,  sexually  transmitted  disease,  HIV/AIDS,  drug  abuse,  and \n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "40          Appendix 6          \naddiction. In addition to theoretical content, the curriculum should include skill acquisition and \ndevelopment of healthy attitudes. The National Institute of Education (NIE) will be responsible \nfor integrating HIV/AIDS health education in science subjects, health and physical education, \nand  the  life  competencies  components  of  the  curriculum.  Two  national  workshops  will  be \norganized.  \n   \n5.  The main content areas or themes of the HIV/AIDS health education component will \nbuild on inputs from the primary school. The program will begin in grade 6 with a review of \npersonal health and hygiene, and understanding of environmental influences on health. In \nsubsequent  years,  the  topics  will  include  growth  and  development;  and  physiological, \npsychosocial, and psychological changes during adolescence. Threats to health and how to \ncounter  the  risks  will  be  covered  in  topics  including  tobacco;  alcohol  and  drug  abuse; \nreproductive  health;  sexually  transmitted  disease;  HIV/AIDS;  knowledge  and  skills  for \nsafeguarding sexual and reproductive health; skills to adapt responsible, culturally acceptable, \nand safe reproductive behavior; biology of sexually transmitted disease; HIV infections; nature \nof the diseases; behaviors that facilitate transmission and increase the risk of infection; and the \nskills necessary to avoid behavior that exposes people to risks. The program will also promote \nattitudes of respect for human rights and compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS. Students \nwill  learn  skills  necessary  to  interact  with  people  living  with  disability  and  HIV/AIDS  in  a \nnondiscriminatory, considerate, and supportive way. \n \n  2.  Instructional Material Development and Teacher Training \n \n6.  International  and  domestic  HIV/AIDS  and  health  education  specialists  will  design  a \ntraining of trainers (TOT) program for 300 trainers from the 18 NCOEs, 10 TTCs, and 92 TCs. \nFour hundred sets of TOT materials will be provided for the TOT program. The TOT program \nwill develop a network of trainers to teach 6,000 secondary school teachers and to serve as \nresource people in the 92 education zones. Six thousand and five hundred sets of teacher \ntraining materials will be prepared for the training of teachers. Approximately 12 TOTs2 of 5-day \nduration will be conducted at NIE for NCOEs, TTCs, and TC personnel. An estimated 250 3-day \nprovincial teacher training workshops will be conducted for secondary school teachers. The \nProject will provide instructional materials, cost of transportation, accommodation, and meals for \nthe participants to attend the training programs. Ten teachers per province will undertake 1 \nmonth  of  training  in  Asia  on  innovative  teaching  learning  for  HIV/AIDS  education.  Staff \ndevelopment program in Asia for 30 staff will be available.  \n \n  3.  Teacher and Student Support \n \n7.  Available learning materials from the international market will be purchased and made \navailable  to  the  resource  centers.  Multimedia  learning  materials  for  classroom  use  will  be \nprepared and distributed to the teachers. To provide continuing support to local teachers and \nstudents, a resource center will be identified in each zone. The existing network of TC will be \nthe first choice for locating the HIV/AIDS health education zonal resource center. Each zonal \nresource center will be multipurpose to provide information to teachers, students, and parents. \nEach center will be equipped to accommodate two full-time staff and include a resource room \nwith  print  materials  and  a  minimum  of  two  computers  to  access  online  resources.  This \ncentralized service approach in each zone will be used to support the initiatives of other project \ncomponents thus increasing utilization rates and efficiency of existing physical and human \n                                                 \n2  The maximum number of participants per workshop is 30. The same workshop will be repeated 12 times.   ", "Appendix 6          41           \n \nresources.  The  27  largest  TCs  will  be  equipped  with  multimedia  systems  such  as  digital \nprojectors, DVD players, and accessories.  \n  \n8.  In areas where a TC is not well located or otherwise not suitable as a resource center, a \nschool or alternate facility may be appropriate. The centers should be accessible to students \nfrom physical and psychosocial perspectives. Learning resources at the center will supplement \nwhat is taught in class and will consist of printed materials as well as software. The center will \nalso have web-based facilities to enable students to anonymously ask and receive a response \nto a question. Counseling, especially on reproductive health matters, will be made available. \nServices of field health staff such as from the Ministry of Health will be available as needed, on \na call basis to strengthen the service provided through the center. \n  \n9.  The Project will provide civil works for office refurbishment for the School Health and \nNutrition Unit of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the zonal resource centers; furniture and \nmultimedia equipment for the resource centers; international and local training; consultancy \nservices; and operating expenses, such as monitoring cost and communications.  \n        \nD.  Project Implementation Arrangements  \n \n10.  The  School  Health  and  Nutrition  Unit  of  MOE  will  plan  and  coordinate  project \nimplementation,  with  the  assistance  of  national  and  international  consultants  in  HIV/AIDS \neducation. A technical committee comprising the education advisor of the Secondary Education \nModernization Project II; the Science, Health, and Physical Education Department of NIE; and \nthe Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health will serve as an advisory group to the MOE \nSchool Health and Nutrition Unit. The agencies involved in HIV/AIDS education will be invited to \njoin the technical committee meetings as required. The project management office will be \nresponsible for all procurement, disbursement, and reporting. MOE will design and maintain a \nwebpage for the Project that will include regular disclosure of project-related information to \nincrease transparency, accountability, and efficiency of project implementation.   \n \nE.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n11.  The School Health and Nutrition Unit of MOE will establish monitoring indicators of \nproject progress, outcome, and impact in consultation with the technical committee. The core \ngroup of teacher educators in each zone will provide information for monitoring and evaluation. \nA  school  recognition  and  reward  system  based  on  objective  criteria  for  success  will  be \ndeveloped and schools with good performance will be recognized and acknowledged through a \npublic information campaign. \n ", " \n4\n2\n     \n \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES    \n \n \n  A\np\np\nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimate by Financier  e\nn\n($ million)  d\nix\nSri Lanka    7\n \nEducation for Knowledge Society Project  \nDisbursement Accounts by Financiers   Asian Development Asian Development Government of Local\n($ Million)   Bank (Loan) Bank (Grant) Sri Lanka Total For.

The Project also pays attention to health education to \nincrease  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS,1  emphasizing  the  importance  of  preventive  measures  to \ncontrol such diseases among the school population. Increases in secondary and tertiary school \nenrollment and completion rates are some of the measurable outcomes of the Project. \n \n2.  The Project will address issues relevant to the prevailing economic situation in the \ncountry  where  unemployment  among  secondary  school  leavers  remains  high.  The  Project \nrecognizes  that  this  problem  arises  from  a  combination  of  factors,  including  the  lack  of \nmarketable skills among school leavers, lack of appropriate training facilities, lack of access to \nteaching and learning in key subjects such as information and communication technology (ICT), \nand limited dissemination of information about labor market conditions and the knowledge and \nqualifications needed by employers. The economic impact of the Project will arise through the \nhigher employability of school leavers after their exposure to educational and training programs \nsupported  by  the  Project.  These  education  and  training  programs  will  help  them  secure \nemployment with higher earnings as compared with school leavers currently entering the labor \nmarket with secondary and postsecondary education. \n \nB.  Project Demand \n \n3.  The need for the Project results from the inadequacies in the current education system, \nwhich reflects the traditional emphasis of the education system and public preferences for \nformal academic programs leading to university education. Despite the introduction of vocational \ntraining in the early 1990s, inadequacies still exist in terms of the availability of market-driven \nskills, particularly among those entering the labor market for the first time. As a result, there is a \nmismatch between the skills demanded by the private sector and those acquired by secondary \nand  postsecondary  students.  This  problem  was  highlighted  in  The  National  ICT  Policy  in \nEducation (2001) and Proposals for a National Policy Framework on General Education in Sri \nLanka (2003) prepared by the National Education Commission. The latter in particular highlights \nthe dearth of graduates qualified in science, mathematics, and ICT. The 2004\u20132005 Global \nCompetitiveness Report noted that inadequate skills and quality of the work force was one of \nthe constraints to developing business in Sri Lanka.2  \n \n4.  Most of the demand for the Project comes from the formal and informal private sector, \nwhich employs 90% of the labor force. Demand for skilled secondary and postsecondary school \nleavers is increasing (Supplementary Appendix C). Given the major emphasis of the Project on \nimproving English language and ICT skills, secondary and tertiary graduates will be more \nreadily employable as their skills will more closely match labor demand in the private sector. \nThe improved employability of these graduates will also facilitate the adoption of new industrial \nprocesses  and  technologies  and  product  diversification.  While  the  Project  will  significantly \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n2  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka.  2005.

Project Benefits \n \n1.  Efficiency in the Job Market \n \n5.  As  analyzed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  unemployment  among  graduates  with \nsecondary and postsecondary education is high, particularly for those aged 15\u201329 years. At the \nsame time, labor demand is high for skilled school leavers with relevant knowledge and skills, \nespecially in manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage and \ncommunication, banking and finance, real estate, and community development. \n \n6.  The gaps that exist in labor supply in relation to demand suggest that the lack of relevant \nskills influences unemployment more than the lack of employment opportunities. The economy \ncurrently generates around 200,000 new jobs per year, 45% of which are filled by employees \nwith secondary and postsecondary education. However, most of these jobs are at the minimum \nwage. The 2005 labor market survey carried out in connection with the Asian Development \nBank-assisted Human Resource Investment Project3 estimated the shortfall in semiskilled and \nskilled labor to be around 122,000 jobs by the end of 2007. Accordingly, the Project will focus on \nfilling the gap at higher technical levels in areas of high economic demand. \n \n7.  Employers will benefit from recruiting new employees with improved skills. Industrialists \nin particular will be willing to hire graduates with generic skills, as they are more adaptable to \nlearning the additional skills needed by specific industries. The availability of a labor force with \nmore suitable work skills will also help the private sector to avoid some of the difficulties \nencountered due to the Government\u2019s very strict labor regulations.4 \n \n8.  Different  wages  are  offered  within  the  same  occupational  group  depending  on \nqualifications and experience. Accordingly, it is expected that school leavers with qualifications \nprovided by the Project will receive a higher wage than at present. In addition, they can move \nfurther and reach higher wage levels after successfully completing the job training provided by \nprivate sector institutions. The additional skills acquired through the Project will also help those \nwho are self-employed. \n \n2.  Increased Efficiency of the Education System  \n \n9.  The Project will significantly improve the quality and relevance of secondary and tertiary \neducation  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  Project  will  upgrade  150  provincially  administered  schools, \nparticularly in disadvantaged areas, and will also provide scholarships to deserving students. \nThese two activities will encourage students to continue their education beyond primary level \nand will contribute to higher retention among school children at all levels. \n \n10.  Improving the efficiency, quality and relevance of education fundamentally depends on \nhaving  teachers  who  are  capable  of  meeting  that  challenge.  Accordingly,  the  Project  will \ndevelop skills of teachers at secondary and tertiary levels through professional training in ICT \nand communication skills. In order to support this, the Project also emphasizes the need to \n                                                 \n3 ADB.2007. Preparing the Human Resource Investment Project.

", "Appendix 11         53 \nrevise curricula to reflect the changing needs of secondary education, and to develop teaching \nmaterials and text books accordingly. \n \n11.  The Project will promote knowledge-based development by upgrading tertiary education \nand teacher training institutions, including those responsible for developing curriculum and \nteacher guides. The Project will improve the quality of teaching and make teachers aware of \nmodern teaching methodologies, leading to more relevant programs reflecting the needs of a \nmodern economy. \n \n12.  The HIV/AIDS health education program will considerably reduce the cost of fighting \nHIV/AIDS in the future. Although Sri Lanka has relatively low prevalence of HIV infection in \ncomparison with other developing nations, the potential significance of the problem cannot be \nignored. In countries where HIV infection has reached epidemic proportions, there have been \nheavy economic and social costs due to treatment costs, premature death, loss of employment \nand income, and disintegration of families. \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n13.  Another contribution of the Project will be to reduce regional disparity and poverty. \nDespite the impressive performance of the economy in recent years, with 5.5% growth in 2004, \n6.3% in 2005 and 7.4% in 2006, Sri Lanka is characterized by significant regional disparities in \ndevelopment, income distribution, and poverty. The Western Province, which accounts for 28% \nof the total population, has the highest concentration of industrial activities and services. This \nprovince accounted for nearly 50% of Gross Domestic Product in 2003, including more than \n60% of industrial output and nearly 60% of services output. All other provinces play a very \nlimited role in industrial production and services. \n \n14.  Successive Governments have tried to encourage investment in regions other than the \nWestern Province in order to bring about more equitable economic growth and create more \nemployment  opportunities.  However,  these  efforts  have  been  constrained  by  the  relatively \nlimited infrastructure facilities and supply shortages of skilled and semi-skilled labor. Although \nthe Project will not remedy all the problems underlying regional disparity, the availability of a \nmore productive labor force with relevant skills will be an important factor to attract investment \nto the provinces for expanded industrial activities. \n \nD.  Sustainability \n \n15.  As the Project does not directly generate income, the key to sustaining the Project \nbenefits will be the budgetary allocation to cover expenditures beyond the implementation \nphase. The annual financial requirement to sustain the Project is estimated to be around $4-5 \nmillion. This will account for about 4-5% of the present recurrent budget in the education sector. \nThe  Government  has  a  strong  incentive  and  commitment  to  allocate  sufficient  funds.  The \nincentive comes from the benefits of the Project in terms of faster growth and more equitable \nemployment  and  income  generation  for  secondary  and  postsecondary  graduates  in  both \ndomestic and international markets. Recognizing these broad economic and social benefits, the \nGovernment  has  assured  as  a  condition  for  ADB  financing  that  throughout  the  Project\u2019s \nimplementation and after Project completion, sufficient funds will be allocated from its budget to \noperate and maintain the improved schools and their facilities, and to pay salaries of teachers, \nprincipals, and support staff. Furthermore, cost-recovery measures and business plans have \nbeen developed for the upgrading of the institutions supported under the Project. \n ", "54          Appendix 12         \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in the country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe goal of the Education for Knowledge Society Project (EKSP) is to increase access to quality secondary schooling \nand a variety of tertiary education programs relevant to the diverse needs of the learners, their communities, and the \nnation. The goal will be achieved by increasing enrollment, retention, and completion rates of youth in secondary \nschools and tertiary education particularly in rural and disadvantaged locations. The Project is designed to better suit \nthe needs of the majority of students who exit the general education system rather than continuing on to university. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  teacher  development  with  greater  application  of  knowledge  through  activity-based \nteaching, team work, effective communication, problem solving, and critical thinking. The Project\u2019s focus of increasing \nretention and completion rates in secondary schools combined with the geographic and social economic attention to \nrural and remote communities (including plantations) will have a significant positive impact on low income families. \nThe selection of 150 schools to be upgraded through the Project supports the development of smaller communities. \nOne of the criteria for school selection is low ranking on the poverty index of all divisional secretariat divisions in Sri \nLanka. The poorest 150 divisions will be identified. Further scrutiny of schools selected for upgrading will be \nundertaken during project implementation. The convergence of factors such as the recent change to competency-\nbased education curriculum and teaching methodology, the introduction of practical subjects in junior secondary and \ntechnical subjects in senior secondary, greater access to computers, and more opportunities to learn sciences should \nimprove schooling for all students and particularly those in disadvantaged areas.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nApproximately 25% of the population of Sri Lanka experience absolute poverty. The incidence of poverty varies \nsignificantly by province. Northern and Eastern provinces are the poorest areas largely due to a quarter century of \narmed conflict. Uva Province and North Central Province rank third and fourth poorest. Income poverty is primarily a \nrural phenomenon with about 85% of poor households located in rural areas. The poor suffer mostly from low quality \nsocial services. Access to social facilities is generally broad, but education outcomes of the poor are well below the \nnational average. The benefits of growth in the richer provinces and the nation generally are not being distributed \nevenly throughout the country. Economic development has tended to benefit Western Province with only about 10% of \nthe population largely bypassing the rural areas that account for 80% of the population.   \nImpact of Poverty on Education  \nThe impact of poverty on education is reduced somewhat by government programs to provide free uniforms, books, \nand in needy situations midday meals. International donor agencies such as the World Food Program distribute food \nand assist in the construction and operation of kitchen facilities in schools in the poorest areas. Basic education is \navailable to all, but quality public education is accessible mainly to the wealthy. Low quality education is provided in \npoor and vulnerable areas. Few students from poor areas manage to pass A-level examinations. Thus, the education \nsystem reinforces inequality. An array of causes explains the pervasive low quality, including teacher absenteeism, \nlack of teacher accountability, poor and incomplete facilities, and lack of access to English language instruction \nparticularly in rural areas. Continued heavy reliance on O- and A-level examinations, as the standard of student \nassessment, places additional burden on all families especially the poor.  \nHistorically, equitable access to education has been a prime consideration in formulating education policy in Sri Lanka. \nThe introduction of free education, and establishment of central schools and the many student welfare measures to \npromote participation have been successful particularly for primary education. However, a disturbing trend in the \nschool system has led to the decline and closure of some rural schools as parents are lured to send their children to \nthe more popular urban schools. In the past 10 years, this trend has escalated resulting in the growth of megaschools. \nThis has been described as the bipolarization of the school system. The number of schools with an enrollment of less \nthan 100 students has increased to 2,873, while 75 schools now have an enrollment of more than 3,000.  ", "Appendix 12          55           \n \n \nThe significant impact of the migration to larger schools includes a strain on the transport system as the flow of \nstudents from rural areas to urban centers occurs daily; the physical and mental development of children spending \nlong hours in vehicles and away from their homes; increased competition among parents to get their children admitted \nto prestigious schools and their resorting to fraudulent means, which breeds corruption in the school admission \nprocess; and decline in the standards of discipline in large urban schools as they become unmanageable. In addition \nto these negative effects of popular schools, the Ministry of Education(MOE) and its officers and provincial authorities \ndevote considerable time dealing with school admission issues rather than focusing on improving quality. The \ndistortion of policy ensuring equal education opportunities for all has led to better-off students (20%) having increased \naccess to quality education while the children (80%) in poor and remote areas are becoming more disadvantaged. In \nsummary, the present education system is failing the majority, thus causing the poor to fail in such a system.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Constitution of 1978 guarantees equal rights without discrimination on the basis of sex; universal franchise was \ngranted in 1931. Sri Lanka ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination in 1981. Equal \naccess is provided to free education and health services (introduced in the 1940s). Women have equal rights under \nthe general law but face discrimination in the personal laws of the different communities in the country. Despite \nconstitutional and legal provisions and positive social policies for many decades, women lag behind men in many \nrespects.  Universal  franchise  and  free  education  has  not  led  to  equal  participation  of  women  in  politics  and \ngovernance. Female representation in the parliament and local government is abysmally low, demonstrating women\u2019s \nunequal access to decision-making. While free education led to gender equality in access to education, patriarchal \nvalues and cultural norms and attitudes contribute to gender stereotyped subject choices in secondary and tertiary \neducation, and in technical and vocational training. These factors limit women\u2019s marketability, constrain employment \nopportunities, and reinforce gender-based divisions in the labor market. For the past few decades, the female \nunemployment  rate  has  been  double  that  of  males.  Persistent  poverty,  ethnicity  and  caste  factors,  uneven  \ndevelopment in certain regions, and lack of infrastructure and access to services and facilities contribute further to \ngender disparity. The two-decade war and the tsunami in 2004 have compounded the situation of gender inequality.   \n \nThe gender strategy supports EKSPs\u2019 goal to increase access to and improve quality and relevance of secondary \neducation and tertiary education through better governance and service delivery to suit the needs and aspirations of \nstudents. The Project will focus on youth who may opt for nonuniversity tertiary education to equip them with \nemployable skills to find suitable employment. Quality improvement in secondary education and its delivery in the \ndifficult areas will offer disadvantaged girls, especially in the rural and plantation areas, access to science and \ntechnical  education  to  improve  employability  at  that  level  or  acquire  necessary  competencies  through  tertiary \neducation to suit labor market demands. Special attention will be paid to eliminate stereotyped perceptions of girls\u2019 \neducation, subject choices, and job preferences dictated by the norms of rural society.   \n \nThe gender strategy will be implemented by the MOE, Ministry of Higher Education, National Institute of Education, \nprovincial ministries of education, schools, and other relevant education institutions based on areas of responsibility. \nThese agencies will allocate required financial and human resources to implement this plan in the course of \nimplementing the Project. The Project will practice a policy of affirmative action in hiring staff and consultants. Females \nwill comprise 40% of the managerial staff for the Project. The capacity of implementing agencies/units will be \nstrengthened  through  training  and  consultants/consulting  agency  services.  Project  management  staff  will  have \nexpertise in social development and gender and development. The Project will recruit a part-time gender consultant to \nmanage and monitor implementation of the gender strategy. The design and monitoring framework will include \ngender-disaggregated targets and indicators. The Project will develop and maintain a gender-disaggregated database \nfor benefit monitoring and evaluation. Reporting mechanisms will include both quantitative and qualitative information \nand will reflect the elements of the gender strategy.   \n \nGender issues will be addressed through the following strategies: \n \n1.  Female teachers will comprise at least 50% of the teachers trained by EKSP. \n2.  A gender sensitization component will be included in teacher training curricula and teachers will be trained to \nencourage girls to take science and technical subjects in school. \n3.  Female teachers will make up 50% of teachers selected to follow programs for professional development of \nschool principals and education officers. \n ", "56          Appendix 12         \n \n4.  Gender equality modules will be introduced in life competency programs in secondary schools. \n5.  The scholarship program will give priority to girls who opt to follow technical courses. \n6.

The gender-specific needs of female youth in rural, plantation, and conflict-affected areas will be addressed \nwhen redesigning Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological Education courses. \n8.  Girls will be encouraged through career guidance and social marketing to follow technical courses. \n9.  Media campaigns will be designed and conducted to change stereotype perceptions of male preference and \nmale competency in following technical courses.  \n10. Community women\u2019s groups will be encouraged to apply, through school development societies, to the Fund \nfor Innovative ICT in Education for projects on self-employment.  \n11. A component on gender and HIV/AIDS will be included in preservice and in-service teacher training and \nschool curricula. \n12. General, higher education, technical education and vocational training sector policy dialogue will address \ncurrent issues of gender inequality in education, skill training, employment opportunity, career choice, and \nadvancement. \n13. Female teachers will be appointed to provide career guidance for female youth.  \n14. The teachers engaged in career guidance will be trained in a rights-based approach to help change gender-\nstereotype perceptions in career selection. \n15. The  social  marketing  strategy  for  EKSP  will  focus  on  changing  societal  attitudes  to  enrollment  in \ntechnological fields and removing misconceptions about subject choices for boys and girls. \n16. Equal numbers of women and men from the MOE and provincial education authorities will be trained in social \nmarketing and information campaigns to convey messages through social marketing for attitudinal changes \namong policy makers, private sector, and other relevant groups. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Children in the conflict-affected areas and economically and socially isolated \nregions including the plantation communities will benefit from the Project. \n \nB.  Context and Legal Framework \n \n2.  The population of Sri Lanka in the year 2000 was estimated at 18.7 million. The Sinhala \npopulation constitutes 74%, while Tamils and Muslims represent 18% and 7%, respectively. The \nconflict between the Tamil militant groups and the Government continued for 20 years. The \nwhole  country  has  suffered  from  the  conflict.  The  constitutional  provisions  to  meet  the \naspirations of ethnic minorities are found in articles dealing with fundamental rights, proportional \nrepresentation,  language  policy,  and  devolution.  The  13th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution \ndeclared that Sinhalese and Tamil languages shall be official languages. English is declared to \nbe the link language. The 16th Amendment passed in 1988 declared that Sinhala and Tamil be \nthe languages of administration and language of the courts throughout Sri Lanka. \n \n \nC.  Project Components to Ensure Equity in Quality Education for All Ethnic Groups  \n \n3.  The ethnic equity framework is developed to ensure that all ethnic groups in the project \nareas have equal access to project benefits. Central and provincial education authorities will \nplan and implement project components according to project implementation arrangements for \nvarious administrative levels in the education sector. The Project gives priority to students from \neconomically deprived and conflict-affected areas. The prevailing political and security contexts \nmust be taken into account and measures taken to ensure that objectives and activities will not \nbe compromised by the project environment. \n \n ", "58          Appendix 13         \n \nTable A13:  Project Interventions and Actions to Ensure Ethnic Equity Benefit \n \nProject Interventions  Actions to Ensure Equal Benefit to All Ethnic Groups \nUpgrade  150  provincial  type  C  and  type  2  schools  1.

Conflict Sensitivity in Implementing the EEF  \n \n5.  Considering the vulnerable security situation in conflict affected areas, the Project may not \nbe able to implement the EEF effectively until there is full resumption of peace and order. The \nProject has built maximum flexibility in its implementation so that children in those areas do not \nremain excluded from the benefits of modern knowledge and technologies. For instance, for the \nupgrading of secondary schools, if in any given year selected schools from the Northern Province  \ncannot be upgraded due to security concerns, those schools will be replaced in that year with \nschools from another area, but the overall project quota for schools to be upgraded from the \nNorthern Province will not change.
