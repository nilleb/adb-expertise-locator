The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR)  for  the  Supporting  Irrigation  Scheme  in  Central  Mongolia  Project,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the grant. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  support  the  modernization  of  government-owned  irrigation  networks \nserving  about  7,000  hectares  (ha)  of  land.  The  project  will  promote  income  and  employment \ngeneration in rural areas where poverty is endemic. This will be achieved by diversification from \ntraditional low-value grain crops into high-value vegetables. It will also build farmers\u2019 capacity for \nclimate-smart production and better water and irrigation management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMongolia\u2019s  economy  has  been  characterized  by  rapid  growth  and  transformation  since \ntransitioning  from  central  planning  in  the  early  1990s.  Mineral  exports  were  the  main  driver  for \nachieving  middle-income  status  in  2011.  However,  Mongolia\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks \nunderscored the need for a more diversified and labor-intensive economic structure for the rural \npopulation. In 2018, agriculture\u2019s share in employment was 26.7% while it contributed only 10.8% \nof Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product.1 In line with the government\u2019s focus to accelerate economic \ndiversification and job creation, agriculture has become a priority for growth.2 It is the main source \nof livelihood in rural areas, where more than one-third of the total population lives.3 Poverty in rural \nareas  (30.8%  in  2018)  remains  higher  than  in  urban  areas  (27.2%  in  2018).4  Limited  income-\ngeneration opportunities and lack of resilience to natural disasters increase the risk of rural\u2013urban \nmigration. Agriculture is not sufficiently diversified and relies heavily on imports for vegetables and \nfodder, which in turn threatens national food security and the disaster risk resilience of the livestock \nindustry. Only about half of the country\u2019s vegetable demand  was met by domestic production  in \n2008\u20122016.  Vegetables  are  in  high  demand  by  more  health-conscious  citizens,  and  a  more \nbalanced diet can be expected to have considerable public health benefits. \n \n4. \nInefficient and climate-vulnerable irrigation services. More frequent droughts induced \nby  climate  change  are  a  threat  to  food  security,  and  particularly  to  vegetable  production,  which \nrequires reliable access to irrigation services.5 In 2017, only 1% of Mongolia\u2019s land area (777,000 ha) \nwas cultivated, of which only 1.1% (8,900 ha) was used for vegetables (mainly beets, cabbages, \ncarrots, cucumbers, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and turnips). The country\u2019s irrigation systems are \nrecognized as having low water productivity and lacking resilience to severe droughts and floods, \nalthough  sufficient  water  resources  are  available\u2014only  1.6%  of  the  internal  renewable  water \nresources  were  withdrawn  in  2014.6  The  climate  is  trending  toward  a  higher  annual  average \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2018.

Existing irrigation \ninfrastructure, and fodder and vegetable yields are threatened by water shortages in early spring, \nsnowmelt river floods throughout spring, and flash floods from storms. \n \nEnvironmentally unsustainable production systems. After the collapse of the former \n5. \nSoviet Union, the cropped area declined from its peak of 837,868 ha in 1989 to 162,040 ha in \n2006, as government support through national and regional crop research and extension centers \ndeclined. The cultivation techniques are unsustainable in terms of water productivity and the use \nof  agrochemical  inputs  with  unknown  levels  of  residue  in  marketed  crops.  The  productivity  of \nvegetable-growing systems is further limited by a lack of access to seeds of high-yielding, climate-\nresilient varieties. The absence of reliable quality assurance testing of inputs such as pesticides \nincreases production costs and poses the potential risk of environmental pollution. The lack of \nagrochemical residue-testing capacity at government agencies threatens food safety and access \nto premium-price marketing opportunities. \n \n6. \nInadequate  technical  and  institutional  management  capacity.  Small  farm  sizes  with \ninadequate access to efficient and climate-resilient irrigation limit the scope for productivity and quality-\nenhancing  mechanization.  Individual  small-scale  farmers  lack  access  to  improved  production \ntechnologies,  which  require  larger-scale  operations  to  be  profitable.  About  300  cooperatives  and \n35,000 households in the country grow vegetables on plots of up to 100 ha, but the total sown area \nwas only 8,904 ha in 2018.3 Cooperative and farmer incomes are low and opportunities curtailed. In \nthe  absence  of  post-harvest  and  storage  facilities,  and  with  low  awareness  of  value-added \nopportunities and marketing, farmers sell their vegetables mainly to middlemen. \n \nGovernment policy. Backed by its Sustainable Development Vision 2030, Government \n7. \nAction  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  and  State  Policy  on  Food  and  Agriculture  and  Crop  Production  Law, \nMongolia is committed to improve vegetable production.7 The state policy stresses the need to \nstrengthen agricultural productivity and production management through a value chain approach, \nadaptation to climate change, and capacity building for farmers. The government targets for local \nvegetable  production  to meet  70%  of  domestic  demand by  2020,  and  100%  by  2025, through \nsupport for initiatives such as on-farm mechanization, climate-resilient greenhouses, and water-\nsaving  irrigation  technology.  Policies  prioritizing  smallholder  farming  offer  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  meeting  these  targets.  Following  on  from  Mongolia\u2019s  National  Programme  for \nFood Security (2009\u20132016),8 the government intends to enhance water productivity and expand \nthe country\u2019s irrigated land from 54,000 ha in 2019 to 120,000 ha by 2030. \n \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  in  line  with  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n8. \n(ADB) by creating knowledge and promoting rural development and food security.9 Supporting a \ndiversified agriculture sector with inclusive economic growth is a key strategic priority for ADB in \nits country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020.10 The project will help improve the water \nproductivity and climate resilience of irrigation systems, expand vegetable production and value \nchain links, and institutionalize residue testing for food safety, which is consistent with the four \n\n \n\n7  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  aims  to  increase  irrigated  land  by  adopting  new  and  efficient  irrigation \ntechnologies on 65,000 ha by 2020 (100,000 ha by 2025, 120,000 ha by 2030); boost farmland fertility; and curb soil \ndegradation. \n\n8  Government of Mongolia. 2009.

The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects \nfinanced by ADB and others in Mongolia, as well as from project preparation.12 Accordingly, the \nproject responds to the need to (i) support government executing and implementing agencies in \ndeveloping their project implementation capacity; (ii) expand the capacity of design institutes to \nidentify and apply modern water-efficient irrigation methods in subproject designs; (iii) enable the \ncareful  design  of  water-efficient  irrigation  systems  that  support  climate-smart  agricultural \nproduction;  (iv)  promote  sound  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  upgraded  systems, \nparticularly through community grower groups (CGGs), to  ensure their long-term sustainability; \nand  (v)  help  set  up  CGGs  and  introduce  them  to  climate-smart  production  technologies, \nparticularly for vegetables. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: income generation and enterprise support \n10. \nfor  smallholder  vegetable  farmers  increased.13  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nefficiency of climate-resilient agricultural production and marketing increased.14 \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Efficient  and  climate-resilient  irrigation  infrastructure  and  management \nsystems  installed.  The  project  team  will  focus  on  (i)  upgrading,  modernizing,  and  climate-\nproofing irrigation and drainage infrastructure;15 (ii) strengthening coordination and management \nof irrigation services, irrigated land, and irrigation infrastructure, including storage ponds to build \nresilience  against  prolonged  droughts,  to  ensure  efficient,  reliable,  and  equitable  irrigation \nsupplies  for  agricultural  land;  and  (iii)  planting  trees  for  shelter  belts  around  the  modernized \nirrigated areas. The team will upgrade, modernize, and climate-proof 12 selected schemes along \nwith directly associated infrastructure to provide irrigation services for 7,000 ha.16 The project will \nfinance  the  remodeling  and  improvement  of  main,  secondary,  and  tertiary  canals  or  pipes, \ndrainage facilities, field application systems, such as high-efficiency center pivot sprinkler systems \nand drip irrigation for 240 ha, and associated structures; and, where needed, construction of new \naccess roads and windbreaks. Soum (district) governments will be strengthened to conduct O&M \nof irrigation systems and will pilot a modern asset management system. The project will create \n240 jobs during construction, of which 40% are earmarked for women and 10% for households \nheaded by women; and ensure that all contracts for the 3,094 households to be involved in the \nfarming of new vegetable plots will be co-signed by women. \n \n12. \nOutput 2: Environmentally sustainable agricultural production systems improved. \nThe project aims to improve food safety, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience of \nagricultural  production  systems,  focusing  specifically  on  agrochemical  residue  testing  and \nsupporting the implementation of a new law on plant seeds by promoting the introduction of new \nhigh-yielding and climate-resilient vegetable seed varieties. The project will support the national \n\n \n\n11 ADB. 2015. Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in Asia \n\nand the Pacific in 2015\u20132020.

This is expected to reduce  the use of \nharmful  agrochemicals  and  to  build  consumer  trust  in  domestically  produced  vegetables.  The \nproject  team  will  coordinate  with  the  national  extension  center  to  support  four  regional  crop \nresearch  institutes  (CRIs)  by  (i)  providing  equipment  and  facilities  such  as  climate-controlled \ngrowth chambers, storage cool rooms, sheds, fencing, mechanization packages, seed cleaning \nand packaging equipment, conservation farming equipment, and teaching facilities; (ii) conducting \nsmall-scale irrigation rehabilitation and modernization; and (iii) providing greenhouses and low-\ncarbon solutions to extend the cropping seasons and achieve high-value vegetable and quality \nseedling production. This is expected to increase the production capacity for vegetable seeds by \n0.65 tons and for seed potatoes by 10 tons.17 A total of 20 women researchers and 192 women \nfrom CGGs will be given technical support and training on best practices. \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Technical,  institutional,  and  management  capacity  and  coordination \nstrengthened. The project team will set up 48 CGGs in the 12 irrigation schemes, which target \nwomen  for  40%  of  the  membership  and  25%  of  leadership  positions;  and  provide  training  on \nimproved  vegetable  production  for  480  CGG  participating  farmers,  including  40%  women,  in \ncollaboration with the CRIs. The two main providers of extension services to vegetable farmers \nwill  be  crop  research  centers  such  as  the  Institute  of  Plant  and  Agriculture  Science,  and  a \nfacilitation  partner  such  as  a  local  nongovernment  organization.  Project-supported  CRIs  will \nprovide  capacity  building  on  good  agricultural  practice  and  integrated  pest  management  for \nfarmers\u2019 improved management of natural resources with less use of agrochemicals, more use of \nclimate-smart agriculture practices, and better vegetable production, processing and marketing \ntechniques.  To  further  strengthen  CGGs,  the  project  will  provide  mechanization  technology \npackages, all-weather greenhouses with solar-powered heating and long-life films, and small cool \nrooms for product storage. The equipment will be provided through a combination of ADB loan \nand JFPR grant to the soum governments, which can then make it available to the CGGs based \non predetermined eligibility criteria.18 \n \nC. \n \nInnovations. The project design contains innovative features such as (i) adoption of high-\n14. \nefficiency  irrigation  technology  in  cold  regions;  (ii)  greater  food  safety  and  less  environmental \npollution by building the residue-testing capacity of the IPP; (iii) summer and winter greenhouses, \nincluding  low-carbon  options  for  water-efficient  production  of  high-value  crops  and  longer \ncropping seasons; (iv) promotion of a plan to allocate land within the upgraded irrigation schemes \nto  poor  and  disadvantaged  households  and  train  them  in  the  production  of  high-value  crops, \nincluding  vegetables;  and  (v)  integration  of  an  easy-to-use  asset  management  system  with \nremote-sensing technology that helps diagnose irrigation performance and resolve problems in a \ntimely manner. Stronger resilience to climate change is achieved by (i) replacing open distribution \ncanals with buried pipes to significantly reduce maintenance costs and water loss; (ii) adopting \nmodern center pivot and lateral move sprinklers that can be programmed for efficient irrigation; \nand (iii) introducing greenhouses that contribute to a more circular use of inputs, including water. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n17 This  will  build  on  achievements  of  other  interventions  for  drought-resilient  seeds,  such  as  those  funded  by \n\nInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n\n18 The  criteria  for  determining  eligibility  are  that  (i)  a  CGG  is  in  place  with  effective  government  and  management \narrangements, and (ii) a plan is agreed by all members as to how farmers in the group will have equitable access to \nmachinery and facilities. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fKnowledge sharing. ADB published project preparation lessons and market opportunities \n15. \nin a technical report which identified opportunities for ADB financed public sector interventions to \nenhance  smallholder  participation  in  vegetable  value  chains.19  The  project\u2019s  innovative  climate-\nsmart  agriculture  concept  with  a  focus  on  water  productivity  offers  a  unique  opportunity  to \ndemonstrate value-added modern agriculture practices to other developing member countries. The \nproject\u2019s  experience  with  the  remote-sensing  system  for  monitoring  the  modernized  irrigation \nschemes  will  be  documented  and  disseminated  through  regional  technical  assistance  to  further \ndevelop remote-sensing tools for diagnosis, investments, repairs, and the management of irrigation \nschemes in other developing member countries.20 \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $46.25  million  (Table  1).

Key adaptation \nmeasures include using reliable and efficient water control, distribution, and application practices; \nlow-impact headworks; diversification into climate-resilient crops; and adoption of climate-smart \ncultivation practices. Greenhouse gas emission savings are achieved by minimizing the need for \npower  to  distribute  water  and  operate  equipment.  Climate  resilience  measures  include \nincorporating  infrastructure  practices  against  frost  damage;  reducing  water  use;  providing \nprotection measures against runoff and wind erosion; introducing cropping and tillage practices \nto minimize soil disturbance; extending cropping seasons; and gradually improving overall ground \ncover  and  the  organic  matter  content  of  soil.  Environmental  sustainability  will  be  enhanced  by \nreducing the use of agrochemicals through integrated pest management, stabilizing water source \naccess, protecting land and soil from erosion, and reducing annual river channel disturbances. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  economic  analysis  indicated  that  the  overall  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 20.2% and an economic net present value of MNT112.0 billion. The \nanalysis  also  confirmed  the  economic  viability  of  the  12  irrigation  subprojects.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicated that the project is robust against the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in \ninvestment costs, a reduction in benefits, and an increase in O&M costs. The financial analysis included \n(i)  a  fiscal  sustainability  analysis  to  assess  the  capacity  of  the  final  borrower,  the  Government  of \nMongolia, to provide sufficient funds for all incremental recurrent costs incurred by the project;22 and    \n(ii) an analysis of the financial statements of the CRIs and IPP. \n \n \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n22 While the soum governments will be responsible for financing and implementing the O&M of headworks and main \ncanals,  their  financial  capacity  is  limited,  and  they  are  expected  to  have  to  rely  on  financing  from  the  central \ngovernment. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nC. \n \n24. \nThe sustainability of the outcomes and outputs will be maintained over the economic life of \nthe project by a combination of ensuring proper O&M of the equipment provided for the irrigation \nschemes and establishing  the CGGs in a sustainable manner. Proper  O&M will be achieved  by \nformulating procurement activities to achieve the standardization of irrigation equipment across the \nsubprojects, inclusion in the equipment contracts of the requirement to provide training and manuals \non  O&M  to  project  consultants,  soum  officials,  and  key  subproject  participants,  as  well  as  other \npersons involved. The Government will be responsible for O&M of irrigation infrastructure and the \nproject  will  support  the  Government  with  drafting  a  policy  for  irrigation  service  payments.  The \nsustainability of the CGGs will be promoted by their formalization, capacity building by the facilitation \nteam,  diversification  of  production,  and  promotion  of  processing  to  increase  crop  incomes. \nMitigation  measures  relating  to  the  project\u2019s  institutional,  environmental,  social,  economic,  and \nfinancial  risks  were  incorporated  into  project  implementation  to minimize  the  medium-  and  long-\nterm effects on natural resources, pollution, biodiversity, and financial and economic factors.23 \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing agencies, \nMinistry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Light  Industry  (MOFALI),  including  the  Crop  Production \nDevelopment  Policy  Coordination  Department,  is  moderate  because  of  (i)  weak  internal  auditing \nfunctions,  and  (ii)  insufficient  numbers  of  accounting  and  financial  management  staff  in  MOFALI. \nThese  weaknesses  will  be  mitigated  by  the  inclusion  of  a  financial  management  specialist  in  the \nproject implementation unit (PIU). \n \n26.  MOFALI  has  only  one staff  member  who  is  directly  in  charge  of  procurement.  MOFALI \nstaff are already loaded with government duties and their numbers are not sufficient. Therefore, \nthe  PIU  will  include  experienced  procurement  staff  to  help  support  the  implementation.  The \nprocurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  MOFALI  has  sufficient  experience  in  project  and \nprocurement management of ADB-funded projects, and with this support will be able to fully comply \nwith  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Value  for money  will  be \nachieved  by  using the  lowest  evaluated  cost  option  together  with  appropriate  qualification  and \ntechnical requirements as main evaluation criteria for the procurement of goods and works; and \nby using scoring systems with an emphasis on quality in the case of consulting services. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n27. \nwith the government and MOFALI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  project  offers  opportunities  for  inclusive  development  and \npoverty  reduction  by  enhancing  the  productivity  of  vegetable  production  through  stable  water \nsupply, training, and provision of technology packages, leading to income generation for farmers. \nLocal  people,  including  poor  households,  are  expected  to  benefit  from  socioeconomic \nopportunities  during  the  project\u2019s  implementation  and  operation.  A  total  of  3,548  households \n(12,261 individuals), including 1,041 poor households (3,599 individuals), are expected to benefit \nfrom the project. This includes 454 households that currently farm vegetable on old land plots in \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe project irrigation areas and 3,094 households that will be  involved in vegetable farming on \nnew land plots. The project will create about 240 local jobs during construction. It will also provide \ntraining to farming households to strengthen vegetable value chains. \n \nThe project team prepared a social development action plan (SDAP) based on the poverty \n29. \nand social analysis. The SDAP comprises necessary actions and indicators under each output to \nensure benefits for smallholder farmers, including the poor. The SDAP also includes measures to \nmitigate social risks. Consultations were undertaken with stakeholders during project preparation \nand  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  A  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  the \nproject implementation stage is included in the PAM. \n \n30. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects.24  Women  are  involved  in \nvegetable production and processing (vegetable pickling, jams, and jellies), but on a small scale, \ni.e., for domestic consumption and local sales. Women\u2019s participation in farmers groups, decision \nmaking,  and  post-harvest  commercial  value  chains  needs  improvement.  The  project  will \nstrengthen women\u2019s capacity for and participation in the entire vegetable value chain activities; \nand they are expected to significantly benefit from the project. The project team prepared a gender \naction plan (GAP) based on the gender analysis to ensure that the project contributes to improved \ngender equality. The GAP targets that (i) 100% of documents for the engagement of households \nin vegetable production, including allocation of new land plots, are co-signed by women; (ii) 40% \nof  jobs  during  construction  are  for  women;  (iii)  30%\u201350%  of  participants  in  consultation, \nawareness-raising, and training activities are women; (iv) women account for 40% of members \nand 25% of leadership positions in the CGGs; (v) 50% of farmers receiving improved seeds and \ntechnology  packages  are  women;  and  (vi)  women  are  given  specific  training  on  vegetable \nprocessing  and marketing  techniques.  Key gender targets  are  also  included  in the  design  and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nCapacity  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  plans.  MOFALI  has  experience  in \n31. \nimplementing ADB projects, including an ongoing ADB-administered and JFPR financed vegetable \nproduction project (footnote 12). The PIU under MOFALI will implement and monitor the GAP and \nSDAP. To implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the PIU will include a social and gender \nspecialist;  and  (ii)  MOFALI  and  project  soums  will  appoint  social  and  gender  focal  points  for \nimplementing, monitoring, and reporting on the social and gender measures listed in the SDAP and \nthe GAP. \n \nF. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows. 25 \n \n33. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  report,  including  an  environmental  management  plan,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.26 An environment safeguard specialist will be included in the PIU \nand  will  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  A  project \ngrievance redress mechanism is also in place. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n24 ADB. 2012.

Environmental  risks  arise  from  (i)  potentially  unsustainable \nlevels of water extraction; (ii) construction of large rock barriers and weirs to channel water for \nirrigation\u2014these  may  affect  flow  regimes  and,  for  three  subprojects,  will  be  the  first  water \ninfrastructure  to  be  introduced  on  otherwise  natural  rivers;  (iii)  potential  expanded  use  of \nagricultural chemicals; and (iv) ecological impacts of one subproject located within an important \nbiodiversity area. The project accounts for these risks to the extent possible through (i) hydrological \nmodeling,  which  confirms  that  all  source  rivers  have  adequate  water  supply  to  meet  irrigation \nneeds and comply with national environmental flow requirements; (ii) procedures for measuring, \nreporting,  and  enforcing  water  allocation  and  environmental  flow  volumes;  (iii)  weir  designs  to \nretain natural free-flowing rivers; (iv) training for improved agricultural practices; and (v) ecological \nsurveys to clarify sites\u2019 ecological values and ensure that impacts on biodiversity are avoided. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The project is not expected to have involuntary \nresettlement impacts. All civil works will be implemented on state-owned land and will not involve \nacquisition of nonstate land, physical or economic displacement, or restriction on land use. No \nlegacy issues were found in any of the irrigation schemes. In Nogoon Khashaa (Uliastai soum) \neight households and one company hold land possession or ownership rights along the existing \nmain canal that will be covered and lined within the existing rights of way without permanent land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The households and the company were consulted during \nproject  preparation  regarding  potential  temporary  impacts  on  gardens  and  fences  during \nconstruction,  and  they  support  the  canal\u2019s  upgrade.  Any  structures  that  may  be  impacted \ntemporarily during construction will be compensated for a replacement cost or will be reinstated \nby contractors under the project. ADB prepared a resettlement framework to address temporary \nimpacts during construction and any unanticipated impacts during project implementation. The \nresettlement framework is included in the PAM. The ADB loan will provide consultant support to \nhelp MOFALI follow the resettlement framework during the project implementation. \n \n36. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have any impacts on \ndistinct  and  vulnerable  communities  of  ethnic  minorities  that  would  trigger  the  requirements  of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement on indigenous people. \n \nG. \n \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 23). \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment fiscal resources become insufficient to \ncontinue support for counterpart funds, debt \nservicing, and/or operation and maintenance of the \nproject-funded infrastructure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nFull and timely provision of counterpart funds for \noperation and maintenance of the project-\nfunded facilities is included in the project loan \ncovenants. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and MOFALI have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n38. \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.
