It focuses on (i) providing incentives to auditors and finance officers to improve \ntheir  capacity,  (ii)  improving  trainer  capacity,  and  (iii)  implementing  the  e-learning  and  state \naccountability management information system (SIMA). This will improve governance in public \nfinancial management (PFM) and public service delivery for the benefit of Indonesian citizens. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nto \n\ntranslate \n\ninstitutions \n\nto  use  available  resources \n\nOver  the  last  decade,  the  government  has  placed  a  high  priority  on  strengthening \n3.  \ngovernance in public sector management and public service delivery. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) risk assessment for Indonesia shows the government made considerable progress \nwith  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  PFM.  In  particular,  most  implementing  regulations \nsupporting  the  main  PFM  laws,  i.e.,  laws  on  state  finance,  treasury,  and  audit,  have  been \npromulgated.  Transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  are  key  pillars  of  PFM  and \nprocurement-related  reforms.  This  reflects  the  government\u2019s  priority  to  build  effective  and \naccountable \ninto  more  effective \ndevelopment.2 The country\u2019s effectiveness in providing goods and services has been improving. \nMost notably in 2009, for the first time, the Supreme Audit Board (BPK) gave a qualified (clean \nwith  exceptions) 3 opinion  on  the  government\u2019s  financial  statement,  as  opposed  to  a  previous \ndisclaimer. Furthermore, about 40% of the line ministries and agencies received an unqualified \nopinion.  \n \n4.  \nTo  maintain  momentum,  the  government  has  set  an  ambitious  target  for  achieving \nunqualified  audit  opinions  for  all  central  government  agencies  by  2014.  Progress  has  been \nmade,  particularly  in  the  area  of  budget  execution,  with  the  development  of  a  treasury  single \naccount \nthe  comprehensiveness  and  control  over  spending  and  cash \nmanagement.  Improvements  were  also  made  in  fiscal  accounts,  accounting  practices,  payroll \nand  internal  controls,  and  fiscal  risk  management.  However,  some  indicators  remain  behind \ncomparator economies in Southeast Asia.4 Further improvements are needed to achieve good \ngovernance  to  improve  the  quality  of  services  to  the  population,  i.e.,  economical,  speedy, \ntransparent,  and  accountable  as  defined  in  Indonesia\u2019s  long-term  development  plan. 5  The \ngovernment  has  implemented  the  control  framework  of  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring \nOrganizations and strengthened the government\u2019s internal audit function. \n \n\nto  strengthen \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World  Bank.  2008.  Investing  in  Indonesia\u2019s  Institutions:  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Republic  of  Indonesia \n\n2009\u20132012. Washington, DC. \n\n3  BPK\u2019s  classification  of  audit  opinions,  from  strongest  to  weakest  is  as  follows:  unqualified  (clean  without \n\nexceptions), qualified (clean with exceptions), adverse, and disclaimer. \n\n4  ADB. 2010. Indonesia: Critical Development Constraints. Manila \n5  Government of Indonesia. 2007. National Long-Term Development Plan of 2005\u20132025 or Rencana Pembangunan \n\nJangka Panjang (RPJP). Jakarta. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthat  (i) transactional  audits  were  conducted \n\nDespite significant progress, ADB\u2019s sector assessment on public sector management in \n5. \nIndonesia  identifies  lack  of  adequate  capacity  in  public  audit  institutions,  especially  local \ninstitutions,  which  negatively  affects  the  performance  of  the  government\u2019s  audit  institutions.6 \nCoordination among regional agencies is weak, and no uniform audit planning framework is in \nplace. Although the government regulation (PP) 60/2008 clarified the delineation of external and \ninternal audit functions, audit institutions, particularly regional internal auditors, have insufficient \ncapacity.  The  regulation  requires  all  government  institutions,  including  local  governments,  to \nimplement  the  Government  Internal  Control  System  (GICS).  Under  the  regulation,  the  Central \nGovernment Internal Auditors (BPKP) is mandated to ensure the quality of internal audit reports \nand to provide guidance and consultancy on the GICS. Thus, the capacity of internal auditors \nneeds  to  be  improved  through  formal  education  and  a  professional  certification  program.  In \naddition,  government  officials  involved  in  financial  management,  budgeting,  planning,  and \nfinancial  reporting  require  capacity  development  to  ensure  that  auditors  and  auditees  have \ncommon knowledge and standards. The quality of audit by inspectors general in line ministries \nand local government inspectorates remains substandard with little focus on risk-based audit. A \nrecent mapping process on the capacity of the government internal audit function in Indonesia, \nbased  on  the  internal  audit  capability  model  developed  by  the  Institute  of  Internal  Auditors, \nrevealed  that  93%  of  the  respondents  (25  inspectors  general  and  237  local  government \ninspectorates)  reported \nfor  accuracy  and \ncompliance only, (ii) audit plans were not prepared based on stakeholder priorities, and (iii) audit \noutput was based on the capacity of certain individuals. \n \n6. \nThe  country\u2019s  decentralization  process  (starting  in  2000)  transferred  more  than  30 \nfunctions and 2 million civil servants from the central to subnational governments. However, the \nnew intergovernment setting inherited a large administrative and institutional burden, a multitude \nof  public  agencies,  lack  of  professional  civil  servants,  uncertified  accountants,  weak  public \nmanagement  systems,  graft,  and  corruption.  The  latest  data  of  the  State  Ministry  for \nAdministrative Reforms (2008) shows that 50% of Indonesia's 4 million civil servants were not \nsufficiently qualified. Latest data from BPKP shows that Papua and West Papua provinces have \nno  government  internal  auditors.  Lack  of  capacity  limits  effective  PFM  and  influences \ngovernance  by  regional  governments.  In  2010,  only  7%  of  the  516  regional  governments \nreceived an unqualified (clean without exceptions) audit opinion for their financial statements. \n \n7. \nOther factors weaken regional PFM. First, decentralization resulted in more civil servants \nin regional governments, which translated into more of the budget being spent on salaries, thus \ndecreasing  available  funds  for  better  service  delivery  and  capacity  building.  Second,  regional \ngovernments are seeking ways to expand income sources, i.e., taxes and levies, which in some \ncases  (due to  low  capacity  in  formulating  revenue  policies)  have  become  a  burden  to  citizens \nand  business.  Third,  central  government  PFM-related  laws  and  regulations  are  often  complex \nand inconsistent.  \n \n8. \nStrategic  policy  and  sector  relevance.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nplan to promote good national and local governance. The government\u2019s National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJMN), 2010\u20132014 identifies good governance as a priority. This priority \nintersects  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Indonesia,7 which  identifies \nimproved governance as essential for more inclusive growth, especially in the context of PFM \nand  decentralization.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  existing  support  for  local  government \nsystems  and  capacity  building  in  PFM  under  ADB\u2019s  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \n\n                                                 \n6   Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n7   ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Indonesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n\n\fGovernance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR). 8  The  project  targets  capacity  development  for \ndecentralized  public  management  to  improve  governance;  financial  management  systems  of \nlocal  governments;  and  national  and  local  audit  systems,  and  capacity  for  planning, \npolicymaking,  and  financial  management.  This  target  supports  BPKP\u2019s  2010\u20132014  strategic \nplans  to  strengthen  PFM  officer  capacity  to  become  professional  and  competent.  They  aim  to \nhave 2,500 internal auditors at central and regional governments. \n \n9. \nLessons  from  ADB  support  for  public  sector  management.  The  project\u2019s  design \nbuilds  on  progress  and  lessons  from  three  ADB  programs:  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment  Program, 9  the  LGFGR  Sector  Development  Program, 10  and  the  Sustainable \nCapacity  Building  for  Decentralization  Project. 11 They  show  capacity  building  to  be  the  key \ncomponent  to  implementing  good  governance  practice  in  the  government.  In  particular,  focus \nshould  be  given  to  building  the  PFM  capacity  of  local  government  staff.  Incorporating \ninformation,  and  communication  technology  in  the  business  processes  of  local  governments \nimproves efficiency and increases their accountability. \n \nAid coordination. In the design of the project, ADB coordinated with other development \n10. \npartners,  such  as  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  United  States  Agency \nfor International Development, and the World Bank. The World Bank, in particular, is managing \na multidonor trust fund on PFM, funded by the governments of Switzerland and the Netherlands, \nand the European Union.12 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  strengthened  accountability  of  central  and  local  government \n11. \ninstitutions to deliver high-quality public services. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of \nthe government\u2019s internal auditors and public finance officers to plan budgets, report, carry out \ninternal audits, and manage assets. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Capacity Development for Government Internal Auditors and \nPublic Finance Officers  \n\n12. \nTo  meet  the  minimum  standard  central  and  regional  competency  requirements,  the \nproject  will  provide  financial  resources  for  degree  programs  and  certification  for  the  current \ninternal auditors and PFM officers. The degree program will support an estimated 2,500 internal \nauditors  and  finance  officers  in  obtaining  graduate  degrees  in  government  accounting  and \npublic  finance.  To  ensure  transparent  and  accountable  selection,  rigorous  methodology  based \non  objective  and  transparent  eligibility  criteria  for  the  universities  and  participants  will  be \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2008.

Certifying  government  internal \nauditors and PFM officers ensures GICS competencies. BPKP, through its regulation 211/2010, \nestablishes a competency standard or minimum requirement for auditors as a quality assurance \ntool for government internal auditors. The standards include minimum competency requirements \nfor  risk  management,  strategic  audit,  audit  reporting,  professional  attitude \nin  audit, \ncommunication, public sector management, and audit management. BPKP\u2019s target for 2014 is \nthat all government internal auditors will comply with the competency standard. The training will \ncover  PFM  transactions  in  planning,  budgeting,  accounting,  procurement,  public  debt,  asset \nmanagement, ethics, and financial reporting. It will also cover training to support implementation \nof  the  GICS  and  state  budget  accounting  and  Presidential  Instruction  (Inpres)  No.4/2011, \nAcceleration in Quality Improvement of State Finance Accountability. Certification programs will \ninclude the mandatory auditor functional position (Jabatan Fungsional Auditor [JFA]).  \n \n14. \nCooperation  between  BPKP  and  regional  governments.  The  project  will  seek  to \nincrease  cooperation  between  BPKP  and  regional  governments  through  the  transfer  of \nknowledge  from  BPKP  as  the  central  government  internal  auditor  to  regional  government \ninternal  auditors.  This  will  include  active  participation  of  the  BPKP  training  facility  and  BPKP \nestablishing centers of excellence of internal audit in selected regional universities. The transfer \nof  knowledge  will  entail  BPKP  auditors  to  develop  internal  audit  cooperation  with  selected \nregional  governments  and  internal  audit  curriculum  in  local  universities.  The  establishment  of \nthe  center  of  excellence  in  selected  regional  universities  will  promote  (i)  internal  audit  best \npractices  and  (ii)  cooperation  between  regional  universities  in  providing  PFM  courses.  In \nparticular,  the  project  will  look  into  promoting  a  twinning  program  between  more-  and  less-\ndeveloped regional universities. \n \n15. \nTraining  of  trainers.  The  project  will  enhance  the  technical  and  training  skills  of  \n200  potential  internal  audit  trainers  from  BPKP  and  14  leading  regional  universities  by \nexamining best practice in the full spectrum of internal audit functions. The training will include \n(i) internal audit risk assessment process; (ii) setting of audit objectives and development of an \naudit plan; (iii) selection of a sample of representative contracts for audit; (iv) audit execution; (v) \nassessment of value for money; (vi) analysis of audit observations and findings, and discussion \nwith BPKP; (vii) audit reporting; and (viii) improvement of the training methodology. Topics such \nas  procurement  audit  and  contract  management  will  be  included.  The  project  will  instill \ninternational best practices for the trainers. BPKP will play an active role by providing resource \nspeakers to ensure that trainers have hands-on experience. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Development of e-Learning System and Modules  \n\n16. \nThe  project  will  develop  an  e-learning  system  and  module  for  training  and  certifying \ngovernment internal auditors. Full implementation of the GICS will require 40,000 JFA-certified \ninternal auditors in central and local government inspectorates. The current annual capacity of \nconventional JFA training in BPKP is about 2,000 participants. The project will use an e-learning \nsystem  as  an  innovative  means  to  reach  the  target  of  40,000.  The  project-funded  e-learning \nsystem will encompass various forms of e-learning and e-teaching, and may include web and/or \ncomputer-based  training,  virtual  classroom  opportunities,  and  digital  collaboration.  The  project \nwill provide funds to design the best system suitable for BPKP\u2019s needs to provide GICS training \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fto  all  government  internal  supervisory  officials.  The  modules  will  be  consistent  and  in  equal \nquality as provided in the regular JFA classroom training, thus ensuring quality assurance of the \ngraduates. To ensure smooth implementation of the system, it will be tested, piloted, and rolled \nout on a trial basis before being fully implemented. Post project use of the e-learning system is \ncrucial to meet the demand for JFA-certified auditors, and therefore, ADB will ensure that BPKP \nallocates funding to continue use of the system under its national training and education center. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Institutional Strengthening through System Improvement \n\nfor \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\n17. \nState  accountability  management  information  system. The project will assist BPKP \nin  developing  an  integrated  SIMA  as  part  of  BPKP  infrastructure  strengthening.  Capacity \nbuilding for government PFM officers is expected to improve governance, particularly the quality \nof  institution\u2019s  financial  statements  or  reports.  With  its  new  mandate,  BPKP  is  in  charge  of \nensuring  quality  assurance \nfinancial  statements,  and  providing \nconsultations  to  stakeholders.  The  government  institutions  provide  their  financial  reports  to \nBPKP for quality assurance prior to submitting to BPK. The SIMA will enable BPKP to receive \nhigh-quality  reports,  and  at  the  output  end,  provide  accurate  analysis  and  information  to  its \nstakeholders. The SIMA is expected to support BPKP\u2019s accessibility to the reports, and help it \nproduce quality and timely analysis for its stakeholders.  \n \nSIMA  development  will  consider  existing  systems,  business  process  improvement  and \n18. \nchange management, and communication with stakeholders. The project funding will be used to \ndesign, install, and roll out the system on a trial basis, as well as provide necessary training, and \nsoftware development and licenses. The project will undertake consultations and workshops on \nchange management with the stakeholders to ensure smooth system implementation. \n \n19. \nCross-sector evaluation system. The project will assist BPKP in piloting an evaluation \nsystem  for  cross-sector  programs  based  on  government  regulation  (PP)  60/2008,  which \nredefined  BPKP\u2019s  role  as  the  President  of  Indonesia\u2019s  auditors  or  the  government  internal \nauditors.13 As  such,  BPKP  is  mandated  to  conduct  internal  supervision  or  evaluation  of  state \nfinancial  accountability  over  certain  activities, \nthe  government\u2019s  cross-sector \nprograms.  BPKP  will  conduct  the  evaluation  and  make  recommendations  to  the  President.  As \nthis  authority  is  new  to  BPKP  and  in  line  with  the  project\u2019s  objective  to  improve  good \ngovernance  in  PFM,  the  project  will  support  BPKP  to  develop  standard  audit  procedures  and \nexecute its authority. The project will select specific cross-sector programs on a pilot basis. The \nSIMA is expected to support an evaluation system for cross-sector programs. Thus, through this \npilot  testing,  the  SIMA  will  be  used  to  ensure  its  operationalization  and  any  feedback  will  be \nused to improve the system. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Article  49  para.  (2)  PP  60/2008.  Cross-sector  program  involves  two  or  more  ministries  or  government  agencies \n(central or regional) in planning and implementing the activities. Supervision over cross-sector program falls under \nBPKP\u2019s  authority,  not  the  internal  auditors  of  the  respective  ministries.  An  example  of  a  cross-sector  program  is \ndisaster  management  where  the  country\u2019s  Agency  for  Disaster  Management  will  have  to  coordinate  with  the \nMinistry of Public Works to undertake central and local reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $60.53 million (Table 1).  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nincluding \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  have  an  18-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n22. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  loan  proceeds  of  $57.75  million  will  be  made \navailable to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which will channel the funds to BPKP, the executing \nagency.  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  and  services  under  the  project  outputs  and \nproject implementation support. BPKP will fund the remainder of the project cost, estimated at \n$2.78  million  (including  $1.2  million  for  project  management  and  $0.15  million  for  taxes  and \nduties). ADB has agreed with the government\u2019s request that the financing charges that accrue \non the loan during the implementation period will not be capitalized.  \n \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Indonesia \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n95.00 \n5.00 \n100.00 \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Central Government Internal Auditors (BPKP). \n\nAmount ($ \nmillion)\n57.75  \n2.78 \n 60.53 \n\nTotal\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n23. \nBPKP will be the executing agency. The project will be implemented over 5 years from \nJanuary  2013  to  December  2017.  As  mandated  in  PP  60/2008,  Inpres  4/2011,  and  RPJMN \n2010\u20132014, BPKP is the coordinator for the GICS implementation. \n \n\n \n \n \nE. \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  will  help  BPKP  develop  modules  for  training  and  certification,  taking  into \n24. \naccount existing training manuals on state budget accounting, and internal audit as references. \nBPKP will coordinate with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and MOF in conducting training \nand  developing  training  materials  for  public  finance  officers.  This  coordination  is  imperative  to \nencompass  training  already  provided  by  MOF\u2019s  directorate  generals  of  fiscal  balance  and  of \ntreasury  on  regional  financial  management  and  on  budgeting  (also  provided  by  MOHA\u2019s \nDirectorate  General  of  Regional  Finance).  In  addition  to  the  development  of  training  manuals, \ncoordination will focus on utilizing the information system for regional finance management. The \nregional financial information system will be viewed as a tool to improve financial management \nof  regional  governments  nationwide,  while  the  main  objective  still  focuses  on  increasing  the \ncapacity of personnel who manage financial planning, budgeting, reporting, and auditing. \n \nThe project will help BPKP conduct the regional training and certification program, which \n25. \nwill  utilize  BPKP\u2019s  25  representative  offices  across  Indonesia  and  regional  universities.  The \nregional  offices  will  be  the  training  centers  for  the  region\u2019s  PFM  officers.  BPKP\u2019s  existing \nmemorandums of understandings with local universities will support the training activities.  \n \n26. \nBPKP  will  be  responsible  for  project  planning,  implementation,  financial  management, \nprocurement, information dissemination, and reporting. It will set up a project management unit \nwith the head of BPKP\u2019s bureau for audit planning as project director to provide oversight. The \nBPKP  project  manager  will  assist  the  project  director  with  day-to-day  management  of  the \nproject. A project implementation unit will be set up in each BPKP regional office.   The  project \nwill  form  a  steering  committee  to  provide  overall  policy  guidance,  and  monitor,  supervise,  and \nevaluate project outcomes. The committee will also provide guidance on the selection criteria for \nthe  degree  program  candidates  and  criteria  for  participating  universities.  BPKP  will  chair  the \ncommittee,  which  will  comprise  directors  from  BPKP,  MOF,  MOHA  and  the  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  The  project  will  develop  effective  and  efficient \nmonitoring  covering  all  provinces,  districts,  and  cities  to  ensure  timely  implementation,  while \nimplementation  arrangements  are \nmaintaining high quality standards for the program.  The \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.14  \n \n27. \nAssisted by consultants financed under the project, BPKP will develop rigorous selection \nmethodology  for  the  universities  participating  in  the  degree  program  (output  1)  to  provide \nobjective  and  transparent  eligibility  criteria,  including  (i)  a  university  with  a  master\u2019s  degree \n(graduate) study program in accounting or public finance registered with the Directorate General \nof Higher Education of the Ministry of Education and Culture; and (ii) such study program has at \nleast  a  \u201cB\u201d  accreditation  from  the  National  Accreditation  Agency  for  Higher  Education.  The \nuniversity  eligibility  criteria  will  be  agreed  with  ADB.  Further,  BPKP  guided  by  the  steering \ncommittee,  and  based  on  equitable  and  transparent  criteria  will  select  relevant  government \nofficers  as  candidates  to  participate  in  the  study  program.  The  project  will  develop  the  criteria \nusing  the  government\u2019s  criteria  for  the  master\u2019s  degree  government  scholarship  program  as  a \nstandard.  The  list  of  selected  participants  will  be  published  and  periodically  updated.  For  cost \nefficiency, a participating student will enroll in the eligible university located in the vicinity of the \nstudent\u2019s residence. If and when selected participants are in proximity to a university that meets \nthe  agreed  eligibility  criteria,  the  university  will  be  engaged  through  single-source  selection \nunder service delivery assignment (education) contracts to provide specialized degree courses \nto the selected participants. The project administration manual identifies candidate universities.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  \n(iv) Implementing unit  \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n \nOthers \n\nExtension degree program \nMaster\u2019s degree program \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\nJanuary 2013 \u2013December 2017 \n31 December 2017 \n\nSteering committee  \nBPKP deputy of politics, social and security (chair) \nDirectors  from  BPKP,  MOF,  MOHA,  and  the  National  Development  Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS), (members) \nBPKP \nBPKP \nBPKP central and representative Offices, 60 staff \nNational competitive bidding and/or \nshopping \n$4.6 million \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n$0.7 million \nIndividual consultant selection \n \n \n$4.8 million \nModified single-source selection \nModified single-source selection \n$13.4 million \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n840 person-months \n144 person-months \n \nMultiple contracts \nMultiple contracts \n\nUp to 12 contracts \n\n$4.9 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BPKP = Central Government Internal Auditors, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOHA \n= Ministry of Home Affairs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n28. \nThe project provides significant technical improvements through the use of accountability \nand  e-learning  systems  based  on  information  and  communication  technology  in  BPKP.  An \nassessment of technical viability will be conducted during system design. It will review available \ninfrastructure,  technology,  and  compatibility  with  local  conditions  prior  to  system  installation, \ntaking into account other ADB-funded e-learning projects in other countries. Local staff capacity \nwill be evaluated for system operation and maintenance, and upgraded as needed. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  the  project  rests  largely  on  promoting  good  governance \nthrough stronger capacity of internal auditors and public finance officers. Good governance will \nprovide efficient and effective use of state funds for development to benefit the nation. Budget \nleakages  across  governments  in  the  country  are  expected  to  be  reduced  through  improved \ncompetency  of  government  internal auditors  and  public  finance  officers.  Improved  governance \nand transparency will improve investor confidence. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nBPKP  has  sufficient  capacity,  staffing,  and  systems  in  place  for  financial,  accounting, \n30. \nand procurement functions. As the government\u2019s internal auditors, BPKP has extensive financial \nmanagement  capacity,  and \nfinancial \nmanagement  to  other  government  bodies.  All  BPKP  staff  hold  the  minimum  of  a  diploma  in \naccounting  from  the  State  Accounting  Institute.  Based  on  its  experience  in  implementing  the \nADB-funded State Audit Reform Sector Development Program, BPKP is expected to have the \ncapacity  to  manage  project  implementation,  financial  management,  and  procurement  in \n\nfor  setting  benchmarks \n\nis  responsible \n\nfor  good \n\n \n\n\faccordance  with  ADB  guidelines  and  requirements.  Thus,  management  control  of  the  project \ncan  be  relied  upon.  Some  new  staff  unfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures  will  be  provided  with \ntraining on ADB project management, administration, procurement, and disbursement.  \n \nDue  diligence  to  ensure  sound  selection  of  candidates  for  the  degree  program  and \n31. \nparticipating universities covered under the project is required to achieve the project objectives. \nIn coordination with the Ministry of Education and Culture, the project\u2019s steering committee will \nissue and implement transparent guidelines on criteria for selecting candidates and universities \nto  participate  in  the  degree  program  to  ensure  program  quality.  The  guidelines  will  include \nselection procedures and mechanisms to implement the program. \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BPKP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.15  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  project  will  support  Indonesia\u2019s  poverty  reduction  goals  through  improved \naccountability  of  public  institutions  in  managing  state  funds.  This  improvement  will  enhance \npublic confidence in the government and therefore enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \ndelivering basic public services to the poor.  Regional  disparities  in  terms  of  poverty  rates  and \naccess to basic services continue. In 2010, Maluku province reported a poverty rate of 27.7%, \ncompared  with  3.5%  in  Jakarta  and  4.3%  in  Bali.  Inequalities  extend  to  other  human \ndevelopment dimensions. East Maluku reported a human development index16 of 70.96 in 2009, \nwell  below  77.36  for  Jakarta.  The  percentage  of  households  with  improved  sanitation  in \nYogyakarta is more than 75%, compared with around 25% in Papua and Kalimantan Tengah. At \nleast 12 provinces report that fewer than 70% of households have access to electricity; about 12 \nprovinces  report  almost  full  coverage.  Progress  in  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the \nMillennium Development Goals will largely depend on improved access to, and quality of, basic \nservices  delivered  to  the  local  population.  In  supporting  it,  increased  efforts  are  needed  to \naccelerate  development  in  lagging  regions,  strengthen  pro-poor  elements  of  regional  budgets, \nand improve public financial systems and governance. \n \n34. \nThe project has some gender elements because it will directly improve women's access \nto capacity and career development through education and training programs supported by the \nproject. At start-up, the project will collect and determine sex-disaggregated baseline data for all \nparticipating regional governments  and the central government. The project will ensure that at \nleast 30% of participants under output 1 are women. The project will include sex-disaggregated \ndata  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  ensure  the  female  representation  target  is \nachieved at project completion.  \n  \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n35. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \nunder  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \n\n                                                 \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 The  human  development  index  is  a  composite  statistic  used  to  rank  provinces  by  \"human  development\"  and \nseparate  \"very  high  human  development,\"  \"high  human  development,\"  \"medium  human  development,\"  and  \"low \nhuman  development\"  provinces.  The  Center  Bureau  of  Statistics  prepares  the  provincial  index  in  Indonesia.  The \nstatistics  comprise  data  on  life  expectancy,  education,  and  per-capita  gross  national  income  (as  an  indicator  of \nstandard of living or income) collected by subnational governments. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fpeoples.  The  project  will  involve  capacity  building  activities.  Hence,  no  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  are  expected.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  not  expected  because  the  project \nwill  take  place  in  existing  government  offices  and/or  university  premises.  The  project  is  not \nexpected to affect indigenous peoples.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.

The involvement of BPKP staff with prior experience in \nimplementing ADB projects will help minimize implementation delays. \nThrough consultation with stakeholders, if necessary, memorandum of \nunderstanding will be signed, to ensure that BPKP has free access to needed \ndata and documents. A focal point from each government agency will be \nappointed to facilitate.  BAPPENAS' monitoring meetings will be a forum to \nensure BPKP's smooth project implementation, i.e. BAPPENAS relevant sector \ndepartments will provide necessary supports to resolve project issues, not only \nif there is an issue with data access. \nBPKP will sign a memorandum of understanding with the head of the regions to \nretain participating staff in positions for at least 2 years after training, and place \ntransferred or promoted staff in positions relevant to their qualifications. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n37. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n38. \nset forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$57,750,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  State  Accountability  Revitalization  Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 18 years, including a \ngrace period of 6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n8 October 2012 \n\n                                                 \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n\nStrengthened \naccountability of public \ninstitutions able to \ndeliver high-quality \npublic services \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators \nFive years after project completion: \n\nIntegrity index of central and regional \npublic institutions increased from 6 in \n2009, to 8 \n\nGovernment internal supervisory \nofficial governance improved from \n20% nationwide in 2010 to 60%a  \n\n \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nKPK \n\nBPKP \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \n\nFull commitment of national \nand regional governments to \nimplement relevant policies and \nactions related to \nimplementation of the GICS \n\nRisks \n\nDelay in enactments of relevant \nimplementing regulations for \nPP No. 60/2008 related to \ninternal audit (implementation \nof the GICS) \n\nAssumptions \n\nOutcome \n\nBy 2017: \n\nImproved capacity of \ngovernment internal \nauditors and public \nfinance officers in \nbudget planning, \nreporting, internal audit, \nand asset management \n\nPercentage of BPK\u2019s \u201cunqualified\u201d \naudit opinion increased by 100% at \nthe central level from 42.17% in \n2009, and by 60% in the regions \nfrom 2.73% in 2009  \n\n100% timely submission of financial \nreports to BPK \n\nInternal audits are undertaken in \naccordance with professional \nstandards and using a modern risk-\nbased audit methodology \n\nBPK audit \nreports \n\nStrong commitment from \nK/L/Pemda \n\nRisks \n\nTrained officers assigned in \nnonrelevant position \n\nBPK audit \nreports \n\nBPK audit \nreports \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
