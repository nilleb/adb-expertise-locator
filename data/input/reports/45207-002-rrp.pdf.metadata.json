It will address the recurrent lack of sustainable management, operation, \nand  maintenance  (MOM)  and  increase  water  productivity  by  transferring  MOM  schemes  to \nprivate operators and introducing innovative infrastructure modernization.2  The project will focus \non  modernizing the  Muhuri  Irrigation Project  (MIP)  in  Chittagong  division.  It  will  also  finance  a \nfeasibility  study  and  detailed  design for modernizing  the  Ganges\u2013Kobadak  Irrigation  Project  in \nKhulna division and the Teesta Irrigation Project in Rangpur division.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  primary  sources  of  water  in  Bangladesh  are  local  rainfall  (about  250  cubic \nkilometers  (km3)  annually)  and  transboundary  inflows  (about  1,000  km3  annually),  derived \nmainly from the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna rivers. Bangladesh occupies only 8% of the \ntotal  drainage  area  of  these  rivers  but  is  located  at  their  downstream  end.  The  result  is  an \nabundant  excess  of  surface  water  during  the  summer  monsoon  months  and  water  shortfalls \nduring  the  winter  dry  months.  The  impossibility  of  developing  dam  facilities  prevents  flow \nregulation  throughout  the  year.  Despite  being  scarce,  water  is  not  well  managed.  Minimal \nattention  is  given  to  water  use  efficiency  and  equitable  allocation.  Many  farmers  rely  on \ngroundwater to supplement the limited and irregular surface water supplies. However, in many \nareas, the use of groundwater is significantly constrained by arsenic contamination and aquifer \nlimitations.  Consequently,  the  minimum  flows  required  to  meet  total  dry  season  demands  are \nless  than  what  is  available from  surface  and  groundwater.  Competition  for  water  is  increasing \nbetween sectors  including  agriculture,  domestic and  industrial  water  use,  navigation, fisheries, \nand conservation of natural eco-habitats. Possible changes in temperature and rainfall patterns \ndue  to  global  warming  may  also  modify  crop-water  requirements  and  water  availability,  and \nadversely widen the current gap between supply and demand. \n \n4. \nPerformance  of  irrigated  agriculture  and  large  irrigation  schemes. In 2010, 31.5% \nof  the  population  was  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Although  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  gross \ndomestic  product  has  declined,  it  is  the  primary  economic  sector  in  rural  areas  and  provides \n63%  of  rural  employment.  Bangladesh  has  a  net  cultivable  area  of  around  8  million  hectares \n(ha). In FY2012, about 5.3 million ha were irrigated; total rice production was 33.5 million tons \nwith  56%  being  produced  during  the  dry  season. 3 Irrigated  agriculture  productivity  remains \nchronically  low;  since  FY2004  paddy  yields  have  averaged  3.6  tons/ha. 4  The  low  land \nproductivity  is  attributable  to  unreliable  irrigation  supply;  inadequate  agriculture  extension \nservices;  and  poor  access  to  farm  inputs,  markets,  and  agricultural  credit  services.  Around \n550,000 ha or 11% of the total irrigated area is under large irrigation schemes.5 However, only \n46% of this area is currently irrigated during the dry season.   \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Preparing  the \n\n \n\nIrrigation Management Improvement Project (TA 8154-BAN). \n\n3   Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Dhaka. \n5   Large irrigation schemes have command areas of 2,000 ha or more. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfactors \n\ninclude \n\nThe lack of efficient and sustainable MOM continues to impact the productivity of large \n5. \nirrigation  schemes.  In  2012,  MOM  cost  recovery  from  project  beneficiaries  of  the  Muhuri, \nGanges\u2013Kobadak,  and  Teesta  irrigation  schemes  averaged  24%:  Muhuri  63%,  Teesta  18%, \nand Ganges\u2013Kobadak 0.26%. As a consequence, the schemes\u2019 infrastructure is degraded and \ninadequate  government \nneeds  rehabilitation  and  modernization.  Other \nfinancing,6 lack of beneficiary empowerment and engagement  in MOM, and limited capacity of \npublic  agencies  resulting  in  weak  service  delivery.  Specific  issues  in  MIP  are  (i)  inadequate \nbudget  for  system  MOM;  (ii)  lack  of  distinction  between  annual,  periodic,  or  emergency \nmaintenance of a system; and (iii) poor cost recovery from water management groups.7  \n \n6. \nSince  2000  substantial  efforts  have  been  made  to  improve  irrigation  MOM  through  the \nintroduction  of  participatory  irrigation  management,  which  has  been  generally  successful  on \nsmall and medium-sized schemes in Bangladesh but yielded limited results for large schemes. \nThe variable performance of participatory irrigation management in improving irrigation MOM is \ninternationally  documented  and  private  sector  participation  through  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP)  is  seen  as  an  alternative  approach.  It  has  demonstrated  promising  results  in  a  few \ndeveloping countries such as Brazil, Ethiopia, and Morocco but is still to be developed in Asia. \nIn  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the \nBangladesh Water  Development  Board (BWDB)  to  examine  alternative  approaches  of  service \ndelivery  agreements  and  management  arrangements  including  PPP  for  sustainable  irrigation \nMOM  in  large  irrigation  schemes.8 The  TA  proposed  a  conceptual  framework  for  engaging  a \nthird party operator to address the shortcomings of the MIP\u2019s MOM. It established the basis for \nthe social and economic feasibility of the approach and confirmed farmers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n \n The  National Water  Policy,  adopted  in  1999,  sets  out  a  comprehensive  framework  for \n7. \nthe water sector in general and for large surface water irrigation schemes, including a strategic \nvision comprising private irrigation MOM through leasing, concession, or management contracts. \nThe  government  has  established  policy,  legal,  institutional,  and  planning  frameworks  for  the \nwater  sector,  which  provide  a  suitable  environment  for  developing  necessary  sector  reforms. \nThe Water  Act,  promulgated  in  May  2013,  revised  and  consolidated  existing  laws  that  govern \nthe ownership, utilization, and financial management of water.  \n \nThe  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  recognizes  the  need  to  increase  agricultural \n8. \nproductivity,  foster  crop  diversification,  and  boost  public  spending  on  rural  infrastructure.9 The \nplan also presents a strategic direction for medium- and large-scale surface water irrigation. At \nits highest level, the strategy focuses on modernization and improved management of existing \nirrigation  systems  and  expansion  of  irrigation  areas.  To  reduce  public  costs  in  sustainably \noperating  these  schemes  and  to  improve  delivery  service,  the  strategy  encourages  the  use  of \nPPP  wherever  appropriate.  As  part  of  an  overall  investment  program  for  the  water  sector,  the \ngovernment  has  approved  an  investment  plan  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize  all  large  surface \nwater irrigation schemes at an estimated total cost of $745 million. The project will support the \nmodernization  of  the  MIP\u2019s  infrastructure  and  MOM,  including  transferring  MOM  to  the  private \nsector.  The  project  will  finance  preparation  of  a  modernization  strategy,  including  feasibility \nstudies and detail designs, for the Ganges\u2013Kobadak and Teesta irrigation projects. \n\n                                                \n6   The government\u2019s budget appropriation for maintenance met about 50% of requirements for the three schemes. \n7  For  2009\u20132010,  the  budget  was  $126,000  against  a  demand  for  $710,000;  the  irrigation  service  charge  was \n\n8  ADB. 2009.

Sixth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n\nDhaka.  \n\n \n\n\fMIP  construction  was  completed  in  1986.  The design  enabled  dry  season  irrigation  as \n9. \nwell as supplemental wet season irrigation by constructing the Feni Closure Dam and Regulator \nto create a reservoir downstream of the confluence of the Feni, Muhuri, and Kalidash\u2013Pahalia \nrivers. The  backwater from the  barrage enters  the  natural khals  (channels)  and canal  network \nby gravity. From there it was to be lifted by about 800 low-lift diesel pumps to irrigate the fields. \nThe project was to increase the dry season rice area from about 6,000 ha to 20,000 ha. Initially, \nfarmers experienced major improvements in production and were able to cultivate much larger \nareas  with  rice;  however,  siltation  of  the  reservoir  and  khals  due  to  lack  of  maintenance  and \nreduced runoff in the river has reduced the benefits over the years. The area irrigated in the dry \nseason  decreased  to  11,300  ha.  The  increased  cost  of  diesel  fuel  combined  with  low  pump \nefficiency  and  decrease  in  the  rice  price  contributed  to  discouraging  farmers  from  cultivating. \nOpportunities  to  substantially  increase  water  use  efficiency  and  reduce  pumping  cost  through \ninnovative  design  modernization  and  improved  MOM  were  identified  during  the  project \npreparatory TA and will be supported by the project. \n \nThe project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 202010 and country partnership strategy for \n10. \nBangladesh,  2011\u2013201511 by  reinforcing  core  areas  of  operations  (such  as  infrastructure  and \nwater  resources  management)  and  investing  in  irrigation  infrastructure  modernization.  It \nproposes recruiting the private sector to achieve effective and sustainable management, which \nfollows  five  of  the  seven  key  thematic  drivers  of  the  country  partnership  strategy:  (i) good \ngovernance  and  capacity  development,  (ii)  environmental  sustainability  and  climate  resilience, \n(iii)  private  sector  development,  (iv)  gender  equity,  and  (v) knowledge  solutions  through  the \npromotion  of  innovative  irrigation  modernization  designs.  The  project  is  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  as  it  has  a  strong  focus  on  improving  water  use \nefficiency and water productivity.12 \n \nB. \n \n11. \nproductivity and sustainability of the MIP. \n \nC. \n \n12. \n\nThe impact will be sustained high growth in agriculture.

The  output  will  include  contracting  private  irrigation \nmanagement operator under  5-year performance-based management contracts. \nThe  construction  phase  irrigation  management  operator  (C-IMO)  will  supervise \nmodernization  works,  establish  sustainable  MOM,  and  provide  agricultural \nsupport  services  for  the  MIP.  Efficient  management  systems  will  be  adopted  to \nmaximize  water  use  efficiencies,  and  develop  sustainable  and  reliable  irrigation \nservice  delivery.  Viable  and  effective  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost \nrecovery  mechanisms  will  be  set  up  to  achieve  100%  cost  recovery.

A  PMU  led  by  a \nproject director with at least the rank of superintending engineer will be established in BWDB\u2019s \nmain office in Dhaka. A project implementation unit will be established in the MIP, with a director \nappointed  to  supervise  MIP  modernization  implementation  in  the  field.  For  the  Teesta  and \nGanges\u2013Kobadak irrigation projects, a design support unit led by an executive engineer will be \nset up at each project site. The design support unit will support preparation of the modernization \nstrategy,  feasibility,  and  detail  designs  for  the  two  schemes.  A  project  steering  committee \nchaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  comprising  representatives \nfrom  all  relevant  departments  will  review  project  progress,  resolve  critical  implementation \nissues,  and  provide  strategic  and  policy  guidance  when  required.  An  implementation \ncoordination committee will be established in the MIP under the leadership of the BWDB chief \nzonal  engineer  with \nfarmer \norganizations, and the C-IMO. The committee will be tasked with resolving conflicts and issues \nrelated  to  implementation  of  the  works  and  the  C-IMO  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n \nAdditional financing may be considered if the project performs well. The output (iii) of the \n16. \nproject will support the preparation of additional financing. These include feasibility studies and \ndetail designs for modernizing the Ganges\u2013Kobadak and Teesta irrigation projects. \n \nFor  the  MIP,  BWDB  will  recruit  a  private  consulting  company  or  consortium  through \n17. \ncompetitive selection and enter into a 5-year management contract agreement.

In  view  of  BWDB\u2019s  lack  of \nexperience with performance-based management contracts and the need to ensure expeditious \nmobilization,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  recruit  the  project  management  and  design \nconsultant (PMDC) and the C-IMO. BWDB retains the responsibility for negotiating and signing \nthe  contract  with  the  PMDC  and  C-IMO,  issuing  the  notice  to  proceed,  and  supervising  their \nservices.  The  PMDC  and  C-IMO  recruitment  will  adopt  a  90:10  quality\u2013cost  ratio  since  a  high \nlevel of expertise is essential to design performance-based irrigation management approaches \nfor  the  Ganges\u2013Kobadak  and  Teesta  irrigation  projects  and  to  establish  a  strong  and \nsustainable  management  organization  for  the  MIP.  In  addition,  incentives  linked  to  the \nperformance  of  the  C-IMO  consultant  will  be  paid  against  achievement  of  key  milestones. \nBWDB,  with  support  from  the  PMDC,  will  monitor  the  C-IMO\u2019s  performance  against  the \nmilestones.  Least-cost  selection  will  be  used  for  small  consulting  assignments,  including \nexternal audits, independent safeguards monitoring, and simple studies. \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2019 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJune 2014\u2013June 2019 \n\n(iii)   Implementation unit \nProcurement  \n\nProject management unit in Dhaka and in the field (77 staff)  \nInternational competitive bidding \n\n8 contracts (works) \n\n(ii)   Executing agency  \n\nConsulting services  \n \n\nProject steering committee \nMinistry of Water Resources secretary (chair)  \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Local  Government  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  Economic  Relations  Division, \nImplementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division,  Planning  Commission, \nBangladesh Water Development Board, Department of Agriculture Extension, Ministry \nof Fisheries and Livestock  and a representative of the ADB \nBangladesh Water Development Board \n\nShopping \nProject management and design \nconsultant (quality- and cost-based \nselection) \nFull technical proposal 90:10 \nConstruction phase irrigation \nmanagement operator (quality- and cost-\nbased selection) \nFull technical proposal 90:10 \nPanel of experts \nIndividuals \n\nSafeguard monitoring, studies, audits \n(least-cost selection) \n\n7 contracts \n580 person-months (82 \nperson-months \ninternational and 498 \nperson-months national) \n868 person-months (47 \nperson-months \ninternational, 821 \nperson-months national) \n14 person-months (4 \nperson-months \ninternational and 10 \nperson-months national) \nSeveral contracts \n\n$34.00 million \n\n$0.31 million \n$7.10 million \n\n$8.00 million \n\n$0.15 million \n\n$0.30 million \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request, advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred for civil works, \nequipment, materials, and consulting services.

Pumping  costs  will  be \nreduced  by  using  efficient  electric  motors  and  axial  pumps.  Power  surveys  confirm  that  the \nadditional  load  of  5.8  megawatts  can  be  accommodated  under  the  current  and  planned \nsubstation  capacity  and  power  generation.  As  per  regulation,  the  pumps  would  not  operate \nduring the peak period from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. As a precaution, mitigation measures were \nbuilt  in  the  design  to  reduce  the  possible  impact  of  load  shedding.  The  project  will  test  solar-\npowered pilot pumps.15 All technologies have been successfully adopted under the Barind Multi-\nPurpose Development Authority scheme, and local and regional capacity is sufficient to ensure \nquality  construction  and  maintenance.  The  MIP  modernization  program  will  bring  several \nbenefits including (i) estimated 39% water use efficiency gains from reduced conveyance losses \nand  adoption  of  volumetric  pricing;  (ii)  flexible,  on-demand  irrigation  supply  to  support \nintensification and diversification; (iii) 100% recovery of MOM costs through prepaid system with \na 10% reduction of pumping charges paid by farmers to pump operators; and (iv) a substantial \nmitigation of corruption risk by eliminating cash payments to pump operators. \n \n21.  Water balance studies for the MIP reassessed the maximum potential command areas, \nfactoring  climate  change  impacts  and  transboundary  issues.  The  water  balance  and  land  use \nstudies  for  MIP  reveal  that  of  a  potential  cultivable  area  of  38,600  ha,  about  11,300  ha  are \ncurrently  irrigated  from  surface  water  during  the  dry  season.  With  efficiency  gains  through \nmodernization  and  crop  diversification,  the  command  area  of  combined  schemes  would  be \nexpanded to about 17,000 ha. This factors climate change, which anticipates by 2050 a possible \nincrease  in  temperature  of  2\u00b0C  with  increased  monsoon  rainfall  pattern  of  0%\u201320%  and  peak \n                                                \n15 The pilots were designed with the support of the Energy for All Initiative. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nrainfall  intensities  of  around  15%.  Climate  adaptation  is  incorporated  into  the  design  by \nincreasing the drainage capacity from a 1:10-year to 1:25-year return period. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic  analysis  undertaken  for  the  MIP  indicates  that  the  project  is  economically \nviable.  The  project  provides  benefits  by  increasing  the  irrigated  area  from  11,300  ha  to  about \n17,000  ha,  increasing  crop  intensity  from  107%  to  187%,  increasing  yields  by  up  to  50%  for \npaddy  rice,  and  increasing  cash  crop  production.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nMIP  is  estimated  at  21%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  remains  at  12%  under  the  scenarios  of  project  costs  increasing  by  up  to  103%,  and \nproject  benefits  reducing  by  up  to  33%.  However,  incremental  benefits  to  the  project  are \nsensitive to a reduction in the area irrigated and construction delays. The direct beneficiaries of \nthe project are the MIP farmers and the benefit distribution analysis confirms that small farmers \nand sharecroppers will share a substantial proportion of the total project benefits. \n \nFinancial  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  conditions  for  ensuring  financial \n23. \nsustainability  of the  proposed  M-IMO  approach  under  the  MIP  and its  affordability  for farmers. \nCurrently,  only  60%  of  the  potential  irrigable  area  is  irrigated  and  farmers  pay  the  tariff  of \n$138/ha  to  private  pump  operators.  Due  to  the  high  inefficiency  of  the  diesel  pumps  and \nreduced command area, this tariff is only sufficient to cover the cost of pump O&M. It does not \ncover  any  other  MOM  costs,  and  this  has  led to  the  deterioration  of  the scheme  infrastructure \nand  its  productivity.  The  project  will  increase  the  irrigated  area  to  about  17,000  ha  through \nincreased  water  use  efficiency.  It  will  reduce  O&M  pumping  cost  by  switching  from  diesel  to \nelectricity  pumps.  Combined,  these  will  raise  the  overall  revenue  of  the  scheme to  sufficiently \ncover its sustainable MOM. The farm budget analyses reveal that the farmers will generate an \naverage  income  of  $460/ha  (with  the  project)  as  against  $50/ha  (without  the  project).  In \nprinciple, farmers could afford to pay for the full cost of the capital investment and level 1 MOM; \nhowever,  this  would  require  raising  the  tariff  to  $260/ha,  which  is  significantly  more  than  they \ncurrently  pay  and  hence  may  not  be  immediately  acceptable. 16 A  tariff  of  $124/ha  may  be \nconsidered  as  an  interim  tariff.  It  would  fully  finance  MOM  of  levels  2  and  3  of  the  system \nincluding a reasonable profit margin for the M-IMO. Once farmers\u2019 incomes increase to the level \nexpected at project completion, level 1 O&M cost may also be transferred to the farmers and the \nwater tariff would be increased by about $26/ha.17 \n \nC. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nBWDB.  Measures  are  included  in  the  project  to  mitigate  risks  including  (i)  independent \nconstruction  supervision,  (ii) reduced  number  of  contracts,  and  (iii)  provision  of  procurement \nexperts. Financial management and procurement capacity assessments of BWDB conclude that \nBWDB has sufficient experience and capacity to manage the project funds as well as adequate \nfund  flow,  accounting,  and  budgeting  arrangements.  However,  improvements  are  required  in \nseveral  areas  including  (i)  the  need  for  a  full-time  accountant  at  the  PMU,  (ii)  training  in  ADB \ndisbursement and procurement guidelines, (iii) requirement to produce internal audit reports for \nthe relevant zone and circle 6 months after project effectivity, and (iv) provision of a statement of \naudit needs to ensure that audited project financial statements are received on a timely basis.18 \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16 Levels 1, 2, and 3 correspond to primary, secondary, and tertiary drainage and irrigation networks.  \n17 Excluding BWDB establishment costs. \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\ntargets  and \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n25. \nThe project is consistent with the broad development goal of the Sixth Five-Year Plan of \nBangladesh,  which  includes  achieving food security,  making  adequate infrastructure  available, \nand  pursuing  environment-friendly  development. A  poverty  and social  analysis  was  completed \nfor  the  MIP.  The  irrigation  scheme  modernization  will  reduce  poverty  incidence  in  the  project \narea  by  about  7%.19 The beneficiaries  will  be  marginal,  small, medium,  and  large  landholders, \nsharecroppers,  landless,  destitute  women,  households  headed  by  women, minority groups,  as \nwell  as the general  population  in the  area  of  influence,  numbering  about  1.4 million  people,  of \nwhich  more  than  60%  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The  MIP  will  create  direct  employment \nopportunities  for  the  poor  during  the  construction  of  water-related  infrastructure.  The  project \nsupports  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  key  gender  issues  in  the  MIP  area  generally \ninclude  noninvolvement  of  women  directly  in  farming,  wage  labor,  trading,  skilled  crafts,  and \nrunning  businesses and market  stalls. They  also  do  not  migrate seasonally  for  work,  although \nthey do manage their household economy when husbands are absent. The gender action plan \nprepared  has  measurable \nresponsibilities.  The  proposed  activities  are \nmainstreamed,  with  no  separate  resource  allocation.  Specific  gender  design  features  are \nincluded  in  50%  or  more  project  outputs.  The  project  will  contribute  to  improving  women's \naccess  to  the  project  benefits.  Under  the  MIP,  5%  of  employment  generated  from  civil  works \nand 20% of employment related to smartcard recharge vending will be reserved for women.  \n \nE. \n \n26. \nResettlement (category C). The requirement for temporary relocation and resettlement \nduring  the  scheme  rehabilitation  was  avoided  by  reducing  the  cross  sections  (steeper  side \nslopes)  of  canals  in  populated  areas.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared,  in  accordance \nwith the government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), as a \nprudent  measure  to  address  any  involuntary  resettlement-related  uncertainty  during  project \nimplementation,  should  any  issue  arise.  BWDB  has  experience  in  dealing  with  safeguards \nincluding with ADB projects and will be supported by appropriate consultant specialists. \n \n27. \npurposes by the Safeguard Policy Statement, are affected by the MIP. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  negative  impacts  are  typical  for  any \nconstruction  activities  involving  earth  works  and  can  easily  be  mitigated  through  adoption  of \nmeasures  described  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  Consultations  were  undertaken \nwith  affected  stakeholders  and  a  suitable  grievance  redress  mechanism  proposed  to  resolve \nany  project-related  grievances.  PMDC  environment  specialists  will  support  the  PMU  in \nmonitoring and supervising implementation of the MIP environmental management plan. \n \nF.  \n \n29.
