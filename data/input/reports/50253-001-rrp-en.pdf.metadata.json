Bangladesh  has  chronic  power  shortages.  Despite  increases  in \n2. \ninstalled generation capacity since 2010, the country has been facing widening peak deficits in \npower  generation1 since power  demand continues  to  increase  and older generation  plants  are \nshut down for long periods of maintenance. The country\u2019s heavy dependence on natural gas for \npower  generation2 and  declining  domestic  gas  reserves  exacerbate  this  deficit.  The  fertilizer \nindustry and transport sector in Bangladesh,  which also use natural gas, have suffered similar \nlimitations of gas availability. In May 2017, 46% of demand from power generators and 57% of \ndemand from fertilizer manufacturers were not met because of gas supply shortage.3 As of June \n2016, the total remaining recoverable domestic gas reserves were estimated at 13.6 trillion cubic \nfeet,4 and these are expected to be exhausted by 2026. The widening power demand\u2013supply gap \nand  the  impending  gas  shortage  have  resulted  in  the  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of \nPower, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) (i) developing the Power System Master Plan, \n2010 (updated in 2016), which calls for greater private sector investments in power generation; \n(ii) passing the Power and Energy Fast Supply Enhancement (Special Provision) Act, 2010, which \nprovides a role for the private sector to import, regasify, and supply liquefied natural gas (LNG); \nand  (iii)  establishing  a  gas  development  fund,  to  accelerate  gas  exploration,  production,  and \ndiversification of gas supply, including the import of LNG.5 \n \n3. \nTo  address  the  power  deficit  and  gas  supply  shortage,  Reliance  Power  Limited  (RPL) \nsubmitted  a  proposal  to  the  MPEMR  in  2015  to  develop  3,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  power \ngeneration capacity and terminal facilities for the import of LNG for power generation. The power \ngeneration capacity was proposed to be developed in three phases and locations.6 In 2016, RPL \nreceived approval from the government to develop the first phase (the project), which consists of \n(i) a 718 MW7 combined cycle power plant (CCPP), using natural gas as fuel; and (ii) LNG import \ninfrastructure  (the  LNG  Terminal)  supplying  regasified  LNG  (RLNG)  into  the  national  gas \n\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Power Development Board. 2017.

Dhaka. \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Phase 1: 745 MW at Meghnaghat; phase 2: 1,500 MW at Chittagong; and phase 3: 750 MW at Maheshkali. \n7  Refers to net power, which is the gross power generated by the CCPP net of auxiliary load. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntransmission  network.  The  LNG  supply  will  be  arranged  by  the  national  oil  and  gas  company, \nBangladesh Oil, Gas & Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla), and delivered by LNG suppliers to an \noffshore  floating  storage  and  regasification  unit  (FSRU),8 which  will  be  connected  to  the  LNG \nTerminal facilities. The FSRU will be owned and operated separately by a third party, and will be \nleased under a time charter party agreement. \n \n4. \n \n\nProject design. The project involves the following two components: \n\nCombined  cycle  power  plant.  The  CCPP  consists  of  two  9F  Class  General \n(i) \nElectric  gas  turbines,  two  heat  recovery  steam  generators,  and  one  steam  turbine, \ntogether  with  auxiliary  equipment  and  supporting  infrastructure  at  the  site.  The  gross \ngeneration output of the CCPP is 745 MW and the net generation output is 718 MW. When \ncomplete,  the  CCPP  will  sell  net  power  generated  to  Bangladesh  Power  Development \nBoard (BPDB) according to the terms of a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). \nThe  CCPP  will  be  located  on  land  provided  by  BPDB  under  a  land  lease  agreement. \nSupporting infrastructure at the site will include electrical equipment, control systems, raw \nwater  treatment  and  cooling  water  systems,  and  gas  and  power  transmission \ninterconnection facilities. A subsidiary of Petrobangla will supply natural gas to the CCPP. \n \n(ii) \nLiquefied natural gas terminal. The LNG Terminal, to be developed off the coast \nof Kutubdia Island, consists of a mooring point, a jetty, and an 18-kilometer long 30-inch \nwide natural gas pipeline, which will connect the FSRU to a metering point at Valve Station \n2  in  Napura.  RBLTL  will  operate  the  LNG  Terminal\u2019s  facilities.  Petrobangla  and  its \nsubsidiaries own and operate the national gas transmission grid.  \n\n \n5. \nThe borrowers. The project components described above will be owned and operated by \ntwo separate borrowers: (i) RBLPL, a privately owned company incorporated in Bangladesh to \ndevelop, own, and operate the CCPP; and (ii) RBLTL, a privately owned company incorporated \nin  Bangladesh  to  develop,  own,  and  operate  the  LNG  Terminal.  Both  RBLPL  and  RBLTL  are \nwholly owned by RPL, via its wholly owned subsidiaries.   \n \n6. \nThe sponsor. RPL was incorporated in 1995 to develop, own, and operate power projects \nin India and international markets. RPL is the largest private sector power producer in India and \noperates 5,945 MW of power generation capacity in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, and Rajasthan.9 RPL\u2019s power plants generate power from thermal and renewable \nenergy sources, and the average annual availability of all plants was over 90% during FY2017. \nRPL\u2019s power plants sell power generated under long-term PPAs with predetermined stable tariffs. \nDuring FY2017, RPL aggregate revenue was reported at \u20b9108.9 billion; earnings before interest, \ntax, depreciation, and amortization were \u20b946.4 billion; cash flow from operations was \u20b946.7 billion; \nand net profit was \u20b911.0 billion. As of 31 March 2017, RPL\u2019s total assets were \u20b9641.7 billion and \nits net worth was \u20b9213.7 billion. RPL was listed in 2007, and shares are traded on India\u2019s National \nStock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. As of 30 June 2017, RPL\u2019s market capitalization \nwas \u20b9130.9 billion and the company has a credit rating of BBB from ICRA Limited.10 \n \n7. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n                                                \n8  The FSRU is berthed offshore, has regasification capacity of 500 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd), and \n\nhas storage capacity of 146,700 cubic meters. \n\n9  Client Information (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 ICRA Limited, a Moody\u2019s investor service company. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcome. The project's outcome will be increased ability of Bangladesh\u2019s electricity and \n\n  \nB. \n \n8. \nImpact. The project is aligned with the following impact: Power and Energy Sector Master \nPlan for Bangladesh (2016), Vision 2041 objectives of enhancing imported energy infrastructure, \nand  constructing  a  robust,  high-quality  power  network. 11 It  will  help  address  a  widening  gap \nbetween  the  demand  and  supply  of  electricity  and  natural  gas,  both  of  which  are  critical  for \ncontinued industrial and economic growth. The project will increase available de-rated generation \ncapacity by about 10% and provide 12.5% of the targeted LNG terminal capacity by 2041 (footnote \n5). The development of infrastructure to import LNG will ensure that Bangladesh can continue to \nuse existing gas-fired power generation capacity even while domestic gas reserves are declining \nand will be eventually exhausted. The long-term assured availability of natural gas via imports will \n(i) reduce the  need  to  import  other fuels  like  coal  or  liquid fuel,  which are more  harmful to the \nenvironment; (ii) allow the phasing out of expensive, short-term rental power plants that rely on \nimported fuel oil, reducing the cost of purchased power for BPDB; and (iii) result in national foreign \nexchange savings where the import of more expensive imported fuel oil is reduced. \n \n9. \ngas systems to respond to demand. \n \nOutputs.  The  project\u2019s  outputs  are  the  development  and commissioning  of  the  CCPP, \n10. \nand infrastructure to facilitate the import and transmission of 500 million standard cubic feet per \nday of gas, along with the associated job creation and support for the growth of the local economy. \nGender responsive stakeholder consultations and community engagement will be carried out. The \nproject  is  expected  to  create  1,000  jobs  in  the  construction  phase.  ADB\u2019s  PRG  has  mobilized \nseveral  international  commercial  banks,  which  will  be  lending  to  an  infrastructure  project  in \nBangladesh for the first time. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure development and private sector operations, two of ADB\u2019s main strategic priorities \nfor 2014\u20132020.12 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh highlights nine priority areas, \nof which the project is aligned with three: (i) easing infrastructure constraints, (ii) providing climate \nand disaster-resilient infrastructure and services, and (iii) creating conditions for greater private \nsector participation.13 Easing of infrastructure constraints in the energy sector is a core priority for \nthe  government,  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  identifies  two  key  outcomes  that  ADB \ncontributes to: (i) an increase in access to electricity from 72% of households in 2015 to 96% by \n2020, and (ii) an increase in per capita generation of electricity from 371 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in \n2015  to  514  kWh  by  2020.  Led  by  RPL,  the  project  involves  a  foreign  direct  investment,  and \nknowledge transfer of developing and operating energy infrastructure, from India to Bangladesh. \nReliance is the first among several Indian companies to pursue activities aligned with efforts by \nboth governments to increase Indian investments in Bangladesh. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s \noperational plan for regional cooperation and integration.14  \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n                                                \n11 Government  of  Bangladesh, Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources.  2016.

As a senior secured lender, ADB will have a first \nranking charge over the project\u2019s fixed and movable assets; an assignment of the two borrowers\u2019 \nrights  under  the  project agreements,  licenses,  and  approvals;  bank accounts;  insurances;  and \nshare pledges, to the extent available. \n \nB. \n \nADB\u2019s role as a direct lender and guarantee provider will  enable the project to mobilize \n17. \nmuch-needed  long-term  debt  financing,  which  has  very  limited  availability  in  the  domestic  and \ninternational  markets.  The  quantum  of  financing  for  a  private  sector  project  is  considered \nsubstantial, and has been made available by mobilizing commercial lenders (through ADB\u2019s risk \nmitigation  via  its  PRG),  many  of  which  are  lending  for  the  first  time  in  Bangladesh.  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement significantly enhances environmental and social standards for the project. Corporate \ngovernance  standards  are  at  an  internationally  acceptable  level  because  of  the  presence  of \ninternational lenders, led by ADB. Successful financing of the project will establish precedents for \nfuture financings  of  similar  projects,  including  integrated  LNG  and power  projects,  by  boosting \ninvestor and lender confidence. \n \nC. \n \n18. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nRisks \n\n                                                \n15 ADB\u2019s maximum aggregate liability (MAL) under this PRG will be up to $316,000,000. \n16 ADB\u2019s MAL under this PRG will be up to $60,000,000. \n17 ADB\u2019s MAL under this PRG will be up to $130,000,000. \n18 ADB\u2019s MAL under this PRG will be up to $20,000,000. \n\n\f5 \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  classified category  A for  environment  under  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009)  (SPS).  There  are  two  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  (ESIA) \nstudies undertaken for the CCPP and the LNG Terminal. The ESIAs identify the environmental \nimpacts  and  risks  and  incorporate,  in  procedures  and  plans,  adequate  measures  to  avoid, \nminimize,  mitigate  and  compensate  for  potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  project \nconstruction  and  operation.  The  ESIAs  comply  with  (i)  SPS  requirements,  (ii)  International \nFinance Corporation Environmental Health and Safety guidelines, and (iii) national legislation.  \n \n27. \nThe CCPP\u2019s ESIA includes a detailed evaluation of air quality. The CCPP will utilize natural \ngas as fuel and the pollutants of potential concern are mainly oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The CCPP \nwill  minimize  its  contribution  to  ambient  air  quality  (AAQ)  through  the  use  of  gas  turbines \nincorporating dry, low NOx burners. An air quality evaluation using United States Environmental \nProtection  Agency  (USEPA)  approved  dispersion  emission  modeling  included  project  emissions \nfrom  the  CCPP  and  cumulative  emissions  from  other  power  plants  in  the  area.19 Modelled  NOx \nconcentrations were in compliance with the applicable criteria. Dispersion modelling indicates the \nbackground  level  of  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2)  in  the  project  area  will  be  compliant  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  AAQ  Standards,  World  Health  Organization  AAQ  Guidelines,  and  U.S. \nNational AAQ Standards. The CCPP water requirement will be met by Meghna River, a perennial \nriver flowing adjacent to the CCPP site. As  the CCPP will utilize a closed circuit cooling system, \nlow volumes of water extraction and discharge will occur. This will  ensure minimal (less than 3\u00b0 \nCelsius) rise above the ambient river temperature at the point of discharge and hence no significant \nimpact on the river fish population is anticipated. An online monitoring system will measure water \nparameters at the discharge point. Since the area is prone to cyclones, the CCPP\u2019s project design \nmakes provisions to avoid risks due to flooding or sea level rise.  \n \nThe LNG Terminal and FSRU will be located off the west coast of Kutubdia Island. While \n28. \nthe  terminal  itself  and  the  FSRU\u2019s  activities  will  generate  limited  air,  noise  and  water  impacts, \nRBLTL has developed procedures and plans for adequate management of these impacts. The \nESIA found that endangered terrestrial and marine flora and fauna, such as Olive Ridley turtles \nand dolphins, are not expected to be adversely impacted by the project and the ESIA properly \n\n                                                \n19 The CCPP will not be operated under single cycle as per the power purchase agreement (PPA).  \n\n \n\n \n19. \n \n20. \n \n21. \n \n22. \n \n23. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nidentifies  and  evaluates  impacts  and  risks  on  the  biodiversity.  The  ESIA  details  measures  to \navoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  these  risks  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  ADB\u2019s  due \ndiligence confirms that RBLTL is committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions for \nstaff  and  contractors.  Operational  risks  are  identified  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures, \nincluding an emergency response and disaster management plan, are in place. \n \n29. \nDue diligence confirmed the adequacy of the institutional capacity and commitment of the \nborrowers to manage the project\u2019s environmental and social impacts. RPL conducted meaningful \nconsultations with relevant stakeholders at the project sites, and the ESIA report was disclosed on \nthe  ADB  website  on  16  March  2017.  Community  liaison  officers  will  be  deployed  to  develop, \nimplement  and  manage  stakeholder  engagement  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms  for  the \nproject.  The  borrowers  are  committed  to  implementing  the  necessary  mitigation  measures,  with \nsubmission of semiannual progress reports, to comply with ADB\u2019s SPS requirements.  \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  classified  Category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  Category  C  for \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s SPS. The CCPP will not require any land acquisition as it will \nbe located on government land. Impact on seasonal grazing activity at the site is expected to be \ninsignificant  since  this  will  continue  undisrupted  in  vacant  areas  belonging  to  BPDB.  Further, \nRBLPL  has  committed  to  providing  assistance  to  cattle  owners  as  part  of  its  community \nengagement  activities.  RBLPL  will  locate  transmission  towers,  connecting  the  CCPP  to  the \ntransmission network, within BPDB land, avoiding any land utilized for seasonal cultivation and \nalso avoiding impact on standing crops and assets. At the LNG Terminal site, exclusion zones or \nrestriction  of movement of fishing  communities  are not  anticipated  during  the  construction  and \noperation  of  the  subsea  pipeline.  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  expected  from  land \nacquisition for the gas pipeline connecting the FSRU to the metering station. The land acquisition \nand  resettlement  for  the  pipeline  will  be  undertaken  by  Petrobangla  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted in 2018. RBLTL will bear the cost of resettlement activites. Preparation of resettlement \nplans for the pipeline, in line with ADB\u2019s SPS, is not possible at this stage since the alignment has \nnot been finalized and therefore there is limited preparedness for land acquisition. Based on the \nassessment  of  the  preliminary  pipeline  alignment,  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  not \nexpected to be significant given that (i) all land acquired for the pipeline will be compensated at \nreplacement costs and will also be available to land owners for continued use after construction \nof the pipeline, and (ii) permanent impact related to land acquisition will be limited to about 23 \nhouseholds who cultivate a four acre plot proposed for the valve station. To address involuntary \nresettlement impacts, Petrobangla will prepare and implement a Resettlement Plan (RP) following \nthe Resettlement Framework, consistent with World Bank Operational Policies and ADB\u2019s SPS.20  \n \n31. \nThe borrowers will report to ADB on compliance with SPS, including implementation of the \nRP.  Due  diligence  and  stakeholder  consultations  confirmed  that  there  are  no  outstanding \ngrievances  or  complaints  associated  with  the  ownership  or  use  of  land  at  project  locations.  No \nindigenous peoples reside in or around the project areas, or are expected to be affected by the \nproject. The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  territories  or  natural  and  cultural  resources  owned, \nused, occupied, or claimed by indigenous peoples as their ancestral domain. \n  \nDuring  construction  phase,  civil  works  contractors  are  expected  to  provide  work \n32. \nopportunities for  the  local  community. The  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and, \npursuant to ADB's Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.
