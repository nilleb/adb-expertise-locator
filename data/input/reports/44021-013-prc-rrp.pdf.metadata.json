Moreover,  rapid  urbanization  has  left  many  of  Liaoning\u2019s  cities  and  towns  with  poor \ninfrastructure,  severe  pollution,  significant  poverty,  and  rural  migrants  with  mismatched-\nemployment  skills.  Central  Liaoning's  current  population  of  23.6  million  is  now  65%  urban,  and \nplanners expect 85% of the population to be urban by 2050, largely through rural\u2013urban migration.3 \nConsequently,  in  the  coming  decades,  demand  from  millions  of  rural  migrants  for  urban \ninfrastructure,  municipal  services,  and  employment  must  be  satisfied.  Recent  announcements  on \nhukou reform are expected to intensify this demand.4\n  \n \n4. \nThe Government of Liaoning Province recognizes that urbanization is pressuring Shenyang, \nthe provincial capital, which has a population of 7.4 million. At the same time, it aims to reap the \nbenefits  of  concentrated  urbanization,  so  it  is  facilitating  the  urbanization  of  key  townships  by \nstrengthening  their  infrastructure  to  support  higher  populations.  Reflecting  earlier  ADB  advice, 5 \nLiaoning urbanization strategies6 support the Shenyang Economic Zone Integration Strategy.7\n The \nproject\u2019s rationale is to support strategic urbanization in central Liaoning Province through targeted \nwastewater management, district heating, and urban transport development in key townships. The \nparticipating  townships  were  selected  through  a  competitive  process  eliciting  proposals  from \neligible  townships.  Considerations  included  consistency  with  planning  objectives  and  a  balanced \nrepresentation of the integrated development concept, as Shenbei and Waitoushan are in the core \nShenyang metropolitan area; Fuxin, Gaizhou, and Xinmin are located in intercity connection belts \noutside  the  core  metropolitan  area;  and  Heishan  and  Huanren  are  included  to  demonstrate  rural \nlinks with more-concentrated urban areas.  \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   \u201cTownship\u201d  here  includes  the  cities  of  Gaizhou  and  Xinmin,  urban  districts  of  Shenbei  and  Waitoushan,  counties  of \n\nHeishan and Huanren), and township of Sihe in Fuxin. \n\n3  Liaoning Provincial Government. 2009. Liaoning Yearbook 2009\u20132010. Shenyang. \n4   PRC citizens are assigned a hukou registration and location, either a specific rural township and village or a specific \nurban district. The hukou location specifies where one is entitled to receive economic and social benefits. When rural \npeople migrate to cities, they have no social benefits unless their hukou status is changed, which is very difficult. Some \ncities now grant temporary rights for a certain period. In February 2012, the State Council released a circular on hukou \nreform stating that migrant workers and their families should be eligible to apply for permanent residence permits or \nurban hukou in all county- and prefectural-level cities (as are most of the townships participating in the project), while \nadding  that  new  rules  pertaining  to  hukou  conversion  should  not  require  that  people  relinquish  their  claims  to  rural \nland. \n\n5   ADB. 2004.

Shenyang. \n\n\f \nImproving  wastewater  management  is  a  priority  for  Liaoning  Province  as  water  resources \n5. \nare  scarce  at  merely  800  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  capita,  one-third  of  the  national  average.  Poor \nwastewater treatment facilities in Shenbei new district degrade water quality in the Shenbei branch \nof  the  Liao  River  and  impede  development;  the  proposed  project  will  construct  wastewater \nmanagement systems to support urban development. Likewise, poor district heating services affect \nliving quality. By the end of 2010, centralized district heating served 19 million square meters (m2) \nof  the  Fuxin  urban  area,  with  the  rest  serviced  by  small  boilers  and  heating  stoves  in  individual \nhouseholds. During winter, pollutants from these coal-fired boilers and stoves pollute the air. The \nurban  poor  and  especially  women  suffer  disproportionately  from  poor  service  quality,  limited \nheating  coverage,  and  higher  exposure  to  pollutants.  With  project  support,  the  Fuxin  municipal \ngovernment  will  commission  new  distribution  capacity  and  close  15  coal-fired  boilers.  An  existing \ncombined heat-and-power plant will provide hot water to the system. The development will improve \nenergy efficiency and service quality, expand district heating coverage, reduce coal use by 21,500 \ntons annually, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve air quality. \n \nCentral  Liaoning\u2019s  urban  population  is growing  rapidly.  However,  urban  road  development \n6. \nis slow, facilities for public transport and nonmotorized transport (NMT) are inadequate, and traffic \nmanagement  and  safety  are  poor.  The  project  will  facilitate  environmentally  sustainable  urban \ninfrastructure development and improve urban road links and related facilities by rehabilitating and \nupgrading  urban  roads  and  alleys,  constructing  urban  roads  and  bridges,  improving  storm-water \npipelines  and  sewer  coverage,  installing  energy-conserving  lighting,  and  expanding  public  green \nareas.  The  project  will  improve  road  safety  and  public  transport  services  by  piloting  a  public \ntransport  program  and  implementing  road  safety  and  traffic  management  initiatives.  Finally,  in \nrecent years, local governments in Liaoning have, like others in the PRC, relied on debt issuance \nand  sales  of  land-use  rights  to  finance  infrastructure  and  service  expansion.  But  with  increased \nlocal government liabilities and emerging downside risks regarding sales of land-use rights, there is \npressure  to  make  local  government  finances  more  sustainable.  The  project  will  help  examine \nfinancing  options  and  measures  for  strengthening  creditworthiness  by  providing  financial \nmanagement support and training, as well as programs to enhance leadership. \n \n7. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  will  support  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which \nsponsors balanced urbanization and the development of cities that are livable, resource-conserving, \nand inclusive, emphasizing the fostering of urban clusters. The project is consistent with  Liaoning \nurbanization strategies (see footnotes 6 and 7) and aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \n2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC. 8  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy  and  its  Urban \nOperational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, and inclusive cities.9 It supports ADB\u2019s Climate \nChange Program by reducing vehicle emissions per trip, enhancing water resource management, \nand  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  coal-fired  heating  boilers. 10  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport  Initiative  has  informed  the  design  of  urban  road  components  and  related  capacity \ndevelopment assistance, for instance through support for public transport.11 Finally, in keeping with \nADB's  Strategy  2020,  the  project\u2019s  support  for  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  will \nstrengthen private sector participation and the competitiveness of central Liaoning.12\n \nSector  experience.  This  will  be  the  fourth  ADB-financed  urban  development  project  in \n8. \nLiaoning Province.

The  project  has  the  following  demonstration  features:  (i)  strategic \n9. \nurbanization  supporting  a  model  of  concentrated  urbanization,  which  evidence  suggests  yields \nhigher  per  capita  incomes,  more  efficient  energy  use,  reduced  loss  of  arable  land,  and  lower \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  than  less-concentrated  alternatives; 14\n (ii)  strengthened  financial \nmanagement,  in  recognition  of  mounting  pressures  that  threaten  fiscal  sustainability,  that  is \ndeveloped  to  gauge  and  strengthen  participating  townships\u2019  creditworthiness  and  identify \nalternative financing approaches; (iii) heightened leadership, focusing on a leadership development \nprogram  that  promotes  social  inclusion;  and  (iv)  people-centric  urban  infrastructure  and  public \ntransportation  promotion,  including  holistic  road  designs,  road  safety  features  such  as  traffic-\ncalming measures and separate NMT lanes, and bus priority lanes. \n. \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n  \n\n10. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  more  competitive,  green,  and  inclusive  urbanization  in  key \ntownships  in  central  Liaoning.  The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  sanitation,  heating,  and \ntransport services in key townships in Liaoning. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe project has four outputs:  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWastewater  management  improvements.  The  Qingshuitai  town  wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) will be constructed in Shenbei new district with a capacity \nof 10,000 m3 per day and 18.7 kilometers (km) of sewer pipelines.  \nFuxin  (Sihe  town)  district  heating  network.  To  upgrade  Sihe  town\u2019s  central \nheating  network,  the  project  will  build  a  primary  and  secondary  heat  transmission \nnetwork  extending  for  31.7  km  and  12  heat-exchange  stations,  increasing  district \nheating coverage by 3 million m2. The heat source will be an existing combined heat \nand power plant. \nEnvironmentally sustainable urban infrastructure development. The project will \nimprove  urban  road  links  and  related  facilities  in  six  key  townships  in  central \nLiaoning by rehabilitating and upgrading 73.4 km of urban roads; constructing 51.2 \nkm of urban roads; constructing 18 bridges; and developing related services such as \n187.2 km of storm-water pipelines and sewers, energy-saving lighting, public green \nareas, road-safety features, public transportation support, and NMT lanes. \nCapacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening. The  project  will  support \n(a) the Liaoning project management office (LPMO)15\n and implementing agencies to \nensure  efficient  and  effective  project  implementation  in  compliance  with  PRC  and \nADB  requirements,  introduce  credit  appraisal  and  credit-rating  approaches,  and \nidentify  alternative  financing  options;  (b)  a  leadership-enhancement  program  for \n\n                                                \n13 Notably ADB. 2009.

The loan will have a 26-year term, including a 5-year grace \nperiod,  straight-line  repayment,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,16 a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% \nper  annum.  The  loan  will  finance  38%  of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  equipment  and \nmaterials, and institutional strengthening and training. The loan will also finance taxes and duties \nfor eligible ADB-financed expenditures, bank charges, and transportation and insurance costs. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \nchoices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or \nadvice  from  ADB.  The  government  will  finance  $245.35  million,  or  62%  of  the  project  cost.

The processes selected for \nwastewater treatment as presented in the local feasibility study report are relatively easy to operate \nand  maintain,  making  them  appropriate  for  townships  with  limited  technical  capacity.  Urban \ntransport  subcomponents  incorporate  a  people-centric  design  concept  with  special  emphasis  on \npedestrian and bicycle traffic planning and facilities, public transportation, and pedestrian safety. A \ndetailed description of components is in the PAM. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed \nthat  the  project  components  are  the  least-cost  options  that  support  central  Liaoning\u2019s  long-term \ndevelopment  plans.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  were  computed  at  19.6%  for  the  district \nheating component and 18.6% for the urban infrastructure development components, all of which \nexceed the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The results are robust under the normal \nrange of sensitivity analyses. Economic costs include (i) capital costs such as land acquisition and \nresettlement, and environmental mitigation; (ii) project management and institutional strengthening; \n(iii) physical  contingencies;  and  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance.  Economic  benefits  include  (i) \nenergy  efficiency  savings  through  reduced  coal  consumption,  (ii)  lower  environmental  costs  from \nreduced  pollutant  emissions,  and  (iii)  incremental  economic  benefits  computed  as  the  difference \nbetween  the  centralized  district  heating  system  proposed  for  the  project  and  the  existing  small \nheating  boilers,  (iv) savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (v)  time  savings,  (vi)  accident  cost \nreductions, and (vii) savings in fuel cost. Not readily quantifiable benefits such as better health and \nincreased employment were not included.19\n \n \n19. \nFinancial  analysis.  Financial  cost\u2013benefit  analyses  of  revenue-generating  components \nconfirmed financial viability by concluding that the components\u2019 financial internal rates of return\u2014\n4.4% for the wastewater management component and 13.1% for the district heating component\u2014\nexceeded  the  respective  weighted  average  costs  of capital  of 2.4%  and 2.8%. Wastewater tariffs \ncurrently  equal  0.18%\u20130.27%  of  an  average  household\u2019s  income,  and  heating  tariffs  currently \nequal  1.8%\u20132.3%  of  an  average  household\u2019s  income  and,  after  the  government  subsidy,  1.0%\u2013\n1.1% of a poor household\u2019s income.20\n The subsidies for the poor will be maintained. These tariffs \nare  considered  acceptable  in  view  of  better  services  and  related  health  benefits.  Moreover, \naffordability  is  expected  to  improve  as  household  incomes  increase  more  quickly  than  tariffs.  As \nsensitivity and risk analysis revealed that the revenue-earning components\u2019 financial internal rates \n\n                                                \n18 Project  beneficiaries  include  an  estimated  810,000  current  residents  and  730,000  future  residents.  Current \nbeneficiaries include an estimated 160,000 rural residents and 650,000 urban residents, of whom 64,000, or 9.9%, are \npoor. Wastewater management will benefit 60,000 people, district heating 40,000 people, and urban roads 1,443,000 \npeople. There will be 60,000 common beneficiaries of wastewater treatment and roads. \n\n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Minimum living standard security program recipients (i.e., poor households) are eligible for an annual heating subsidy \n(tariff  of  CNY5  for  up  to  14  m2  per  person,  while  the  standard  tariff  is  CNY26  per  m2),  which  is  paid  by  the  Fuxin \nmunicipal government. Pre-subsidy heating tariffs equal 3.5% of a poor household\u2019s annual income. \n\n\fof return are most sensitive to changes in revenues (which come mainly from tariffs) and operating \ncosts, maintaining tariffs and controlling costs will be crucial to ensuring the components\u2019 financial \nviability.  \n \n20. \nA  financial  analysis  of  the  revenue-earning  companies,  namely  the  Fuxin  City  Heating \nPower  Corporation  and  the  Shenbei  Shenyang  Water  Works  Company  (SSWWC),  evaluated \nexisting  tariff  and  cost-recovery  arrangements  and  concluded  that  tariffs  should  be  increased \ngradually  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery.  Financial  projections  showed  that  in  the  first  year  of \noperation, SSWWC will incur financial deficits with operating losses of CNY5.09 million. During this \nperiod of shortfall, township governments will provide subsidies to ensure the continued provision \nof  wastewater  services.  SSWWC\u2019s  financial  status  will  improve  as  tariffs  increase.  Projections \nshowed  that  SSWWC\u2019s debt-service-coverage ratio  is  projected to  improve  to  1.1  by  2019,  while \nthat of Fuxin City Heating Power Corporation will be 1.2 by 2015.  \n \n21. \nFiscal  analysis  revealed  that  participating  townships  have  the  funds  necessary  to  finance \nequity,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  completed  facilities  and  debt  servicing.  Projections  of \naverage annual counterpart funding requirements for participating townships ranged from 0.20% to \n1.60% of projected revenues during implementation, and projections of annual debt service ranged \nfrom 0.01% to 0.10% of projected annual revenues in 2018.21\n \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nin  managing \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Liaoning  provincial  government,  LPMO,  and  implementing  agencies.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that, while the LPMO and most of the implementing agencies \nhave  experience \nincluding  ADB-financed  projects, \nforeign-financed  projects, \nsignificant  training  and  support  provided  through  the  capacity-development  component  will  be \nrequired  on  ADB  policies  and  procedures  including  procurement,  disbursement,  and  project \nmanagement.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nPAM,  including  providing  support  and  training  on  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  and  engaging  a \ntendering agent to strengthen procurement (footnote 17).  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nPoverty and social benefits. Liaoning Province\u2019s economic growth in recent decades has \nbeen slower than that of other provinces because of resource depletion and an economic transition \nfrom  mostly  heavy  industry  to  light  industry  and  services.  Consequently,  urban  unemployment \nrates in central Liaoning cities have remained at over 4%. Moreover, official poverty rates for the \nurban  poor 22 in  resource-depleted  cities  are  high  (e.g.,  18.5%  in  Fuxin,  16.5%  in  Tieling,  and \n10.2% in Fushun in 2009) compared with the national average of about 4% in 2010.23\n \n \n24. \nA poverty and social assessment that included a household survey, community and focus \ngroup  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews  was  conducted  during  project  preparation.  By \nimproving living conditions, public health standards, and the urban environment, the project will by \n2020 directly benefit 1.54 million urban residents, of whom 0.81 million currently live in participating \ntownships  and  0.73  million  are future  residents, including  rural migrants.  Among  the  current  0.81 \nmillion  beneficiaries,  75.3%  are  urban  residents  and  24.7%  rural.  Some  9.9%  of  the  urban \nresidents  and  4.7%  of  the  rural residents received  support  in  2010 from  minimum  living  standard \n                                                \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Defined as those under the minimum living standard security program.  \n23 According  to  a  study  conducted  by  the  Academy  of  Social  Sciences  of  China  using  data  from  the  Ministry  of  Civil \n\nAffairs (http://finance.hsw.cn/system/2011/08/04/051063127.shtml). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe  LPMO  and \n\nimplementing  agencies  during  project  construction.  The \n\nsecurity programs;24\n 18.3% are ethnic minority people of Manchu, Xibo, Chaoxian, Hui, and other \nnationality;  and  49.1%  are  females.  The  project  will  create  25,000  person-months  of  jobs  for \nunskilled laborers during construction, and 160 direct jobs and 840 indirect jobs during operations. \nEmployment targets for vulnerable  groups  and women  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework,  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  social  development  action  plan,  and  loan  assurances.  Air \nand water quality and traffic improvements through the provision of wastewater management and \ndistrict  heating services,  development  of the  urban  road  network  and  improvements  in  NMT,  and \nroad safety and transport planning will enhance public health and safety. Improving the urban road \nand  bridge  network  will  boost  public  access  and  mobility  and  reduce  time  burdens.  The  heating \ncomponent  will  improve  air  quality  and  district  heating  access.  The  closure  of  15  small  heating \nboilers will not cause job losses. The GAP and social development action plan will be implemented \nby \nleadership-\nenhancement  program  for  senior  officials  will  enhance  capacity  for  socially  inclusive  urban \nplanning. \n \n25. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  has  been  designed  for  classification  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, and a GAP has been prepared and activities and indicators agreed. Survey results \nand focus group discussions indicate that, in addition to their employment, women in the project-\ninfluenced area are primarily responsible for housekeeping and caring for the sick and the elderly. \nImproved  sanitation  through  wastewater  management  will  enable  women  and  children  to  be \nhealthier  and  more  productive.  Meanwhile,  more  efficient  heating  systems  will  ease  the  time  and \ncost  burdens  of  respiratory  illnesses.  This  is  particularly  significant  as  women  are  largely \nresponsible for managing household budgets. Improving the urban transport network and including \nwomen\u2019s  needs  in  the  planning  of  public transport  routes,  pedestrian  and  NMT  access,  and  road \nsafety  programs  will  reduce  time  burdens  and  increase  access,  mobility,  and  safety.  The  GAP \nincludes  specific \nin  employment,  participation,  and  capacity-building \nopportunities, and is supported by loan assurances and consultant support for implementation and \nmonitoring. \n\nfor  women \n\ntargets \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  environment  category  A.  An  environmental \n\n26. \nimpact \nassessment including an environment management plan was prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and was posted on the ADB website and circulated to ADB\u2019s \nBoard  of  Directors  on  21  May  2012.  Major  environmental  impacts  and  risks  include  soil  erosion \nand  the  sedimentation  of  watercourses  during  road  and  bridge  construction,  as  well  as \noccupational and community health and safety risks at construction sites. Impacts during operation \ninclude  traffic  noise  and  the  risk  of  surface  water  pollution  if  the  WWTP  malfunctions.  Mitigation \nmeasures  defined  in  the  environment  management  plan  will  reduce  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  to  acceptable  levels.  During  construction,  the  focus  will  be  on  protecting  surface  water \nquality,  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety,  and  adequate  disposal  of  construction \nwaste. During operation, special attention will be paid to traffic noise, the operation of wastewater \nand  sewage  sludge  treatment  in  compliance  with  relevant  standards,  and  the  occupational \nhealthiness  and  safety  of  project facilities  in  compliance  with  worker  safety  laws  and  regulations. \nThe  project\u2019s  environmental  performance  will  be  monitored  during  project  construction  and \noperation  and  verified  by  external  experts.  The  borrower  is  committed  to  managing  identified \nenvironmental risks and has agreed to a comprehensive set of environment-related loan covenants \nand a 4-year training program from 2013 to 2017 with a strong focus on environment safeguards. \n\n                                                \n24 The standards for classifying the urban poor in subproject areas are CNY225\u2013CNY285 per person per month in 2009 \nand  CNY250\u2013CNY310  in  2010.  The  standards  for  rural  people  in  subproject  areas  are  CNY1,250\u2013CNY1,600  per \nperson per year in 2009 and CNY1,300\u2013CNY2,600 in 2010.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fThe  executing  agency  disclosed  environment  information  to  affected  people,  and  the  results  and \nfindings from consultation were used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project \ndesign.  Consultation  and  public  participation  will  continue throughout  project  implementation,  and \nany environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance-redress \nmechanism established for the project.  \n \n27. \nThe  project  will  have  substantial  environmental  benefits.  Improved  and  extended  road \nsystems  will  reduce  traffic  congestion  and  improve  road  safety  by  rationalizing  the  interaction  of \npedestrians, NMT, and motorized traffic. Improved wastewater collection and treatment will leave a \ncleaner and healthier living environment for town residents and reduce the contamination of rivers \nand  waterways.  Savings  in carbon  dioxide  emissions  will  accrue from  the  rationalization  of  urban \nroad transport and road connectivity, as well as from the modernization of central heating.  \n \n28. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  resettlement  category  A,  as  construction  will  require \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement. In total, the project will affect  12 neighborhoods in 6 \nsubdistricts  and  19  villages  in  6  townships.  A  total  of  1,208  mu  of  land  will  be  permanently \nacquired,  comprising  1,057  mu  of  village  collective  land  and  151  mu  of state-owned  land.25\n Land \nloss  is  mainly  to  construct  roads,  WWTPs,  and  pumping  stations.  The  acquisition  of  807  mu  of \nfarmland will affect 500 rural households with 1,770 members,  including 59 households  whose \nhouses  will  be  demolished. A total of 100,263 m2 of rural and urban houses will be demolished, \nadversely  affecting  326  rural  and  309  urban  households  with  2,229  members.  In  total,  1,076 \nhouseholds  with  3,762  members,  and  29 small  enterprises  and  shops  with  339  staffers  and \nemployees, will be affected. \n \nAffected  people  will  benefit  from  the  project  through  improved  air  quality  and  transport \n29. \naccess.  The  LPMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  implementing, \nfinancing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Six  draft  resettlement  plans  and  a \ndue  diligence  report  have  been  prepared  for  the  project,  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing  agencies,  disclosed  to  affected  people,  and  uploaded  to  ADB\u2019s  website.  During \nproject  implementation,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  finalized  based  on  the  final  design  and \ndetailed measurement survey, disclosed to affected people in their local language, and submitted \nto ADB for review and approval, before any civil works contracts are awarded. A grievance-redress \nprocedure has been established for affected people. The LPMO will submit a semiannual internal \nmonitoring  report  to  ADB  on  the  progress  of  resettlement.  The  LPMO  will  employ  an  external \nmonitoring  institute  or  firm  that  will  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  during \nresettlement implementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion. \n \n30. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. Ethnic minorities make \nup 18.3% of the population in project townships, but the poverty and social assessment revealed \nthat they live as socially and economically integrated residents in urban areas. These groups are \nnot  vulnerable,  and  the  only  adverse  impact  is  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition,  which  has \nbeen addressed by resettlement plans. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n31.
