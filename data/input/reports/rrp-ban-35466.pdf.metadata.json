I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Clean Fuel Project.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  A  technical  assistance  (TA)  study1  with  the  principal  objective  of  assisting  the \nGovernment in formulating a strategy to improve air quality in Dhaka and other major cities was \ncompleted in August 2001. The TA concluded that, to achieve the objective, a two-pronged \nstrategy needed to be adopted: (i) reduce traffic congestion by constructing flyovers at critical \npoints and improving traffic management, and (ii) replace diesel-fueled buses and two-stroke \nauto rickshshaws \u2013 the major causes of air pollution \u2013 with vehicles using clean fuel. Traffic \nmanagement is now being improved with support from the World Bank (WB) through the Dhaka \nUrban Transport Plan. This Project addresses the latter part of the strategy and will reduce air \npollution by promoting clean fuel and technologically cleaner automotive combustion processes. \nThe Project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  Natural gas was discovered in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in 1955, in Sylhet \nDistrict in the northeast. Since then over 22 gas fields have been discovered, all but one to the \neast  of  the  Jamuna-Padma-Meghna  river  system  that  bisects  the  country.  Two  fields  are \noffshore in Bay of Bengal. In 1993, as part of its efforts to improve efficiencies in the natural gas \nsector, the Government invited international oil companies to participate in exploration and \nproduction of gas through production sharing contracts (PSCs). The first PSCs were awarded in \n1995 and since then, a total of about 5 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of recoverable reserves have \nbeen declared. Total gas in place is estimated at 20 - 28 TCF, of which 16 - 24 TCF is  \nclassified as remaining reserves2. Of the average production of about 900 million cubic feet per \nday (MMCFD), about 80% is from fields owned by the Government, and the balance from fields \noperated by international oil companies under PSCs. At the present rate of consumption, the \ncountry  has  a  reserve-to-production  ratio  of  over  40  years.  An  analysis  of  the  sector  is \npresented in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Gas transmission for commercial use began in the early 1960s in the Sylhet area. About \n1,300 kilometers (km) of 4-inch through 30-inch transmission pipelines has been laid, covering \nall the major towns in eastern Bangladesh. Recently, with the construction of the Bangabandhu \nBridge over the Jamuna River, the gas supply was extended to Serajgonj town and Baghabari \nPower  Station  in  the  west.  Gas  transmission  is  entirely  in  the  public  sector.  The  current \ntransmission pipeline is in Map 1. \n \n5.  Gas distribution on a commercial scale began in 1968 and since then over 10,000 km of \n1-inch  through  20-inch  pipelines  has  been  laid,  serving  about  900,000  consumers.  Gas \ndistribution is entirely in the public sector.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for the Urban Transport and Environmental Improvement Project. \nManila. \n2 As of the Bangladesh Petroleum Potential and Resource Assessment 2001 conducted by the Hydrocarbon Unit of \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. ", "2   \n \n6.  ADB and other aid agencies have been in a continuous dialogue regarding improving \naspects of governance in the sector, as well as using the sector as an engine for accelerating \neconomic growth. The policy dialogue involves issues such as enactment of a new gas law to \nallow the establishment of an independent regulatory commission, private sector participation in \ngas exploration and production, planning for optimized development of the gas sector and use \nof  natural  gas  resources,  improvement  in  the  corporate  governance  of  the  sector  entities \nincluding reconstitution of the boards of directors, delegation of authority, and revision of the \nconditions of service of employees. External assistance to the gas sector over the last 10 years \nis summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n7.  A small pilot conversion program in 1982 \u2013 1985 under World Bank funding introduced \nthe use of CNG for the transport sector in Dhaka. The development was very slow and up to \n1997, only 208 cars had been converted. Conversion peaked in 1998 with 678 cars converted, \nbut since then it has slowed down to only 52 last year. At present, five CNG filling stations have \nbeen established in Dhaka and about 1,500 vehicles converted to CNG in the last 16 years. \nHowever, shortage in the supply of CNG and lack of maintenance and service capability in \nDhaka have hindered the opportunities to expand the use of CNG in the transport sector. The \nobvious economic benefit of using CNG vehicles and the Government\u2019s strong campaign to \ncombat air pollution have increased the public demand for CNG vehicles and for a steady \nsupply of CNG. The use of CNG vehicles to combat air pollution is already very well accepted \nby the public. It is now time for the Government to provide a continued and adequate supply of \nCNG for the sector.  \n \n8.  Although the total number of vehicles in Dhaka is not large relative to the human \npopulation, the main arterial roadways have high levels of ambient pollutants due to traffic \ndensity, poor traffic flow, and poor maintenance of vehicles. The most striking aspect of Dhaka\u2019s \nair pollution problem is the crowded, smoke-filled streets of the city. Trucks, buses, three-wheel \ntwo-stroke auto rickshaws, and cars create a dense smoke plume that exposes traffic police, \nroadside vendors and the public to extreme levels of air pollution. The number of two-stroke \nengine vehicles increased by 60% from 1990 to 1996 and are now increasing at an annual rate \nof 20%. \n \n9.  Air pollution has become a serious public health problem in urban Bangladesh. Air \npollution by its nature is a cross-sector issue involving transport, energy, industry, commercial, \nand the domestic sector. In Dhaka, however, vehicles represent the dominant source of air \npollution \u2013 there are no other significant sources of air pollution such as industrial emissions, \npower  stations,  or  deserts  causing  dust  pollution.  The  major  pollutants  are  suspended \nparticulate matter (SPM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO ) and airborne lead. The \n2\nSPM levels range from 2 to 4 times the Bangladesh standards and about 12 times higher than \nthe standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ambient SO  levels are \n2\nnearly 10 times above WHO standards. In cities where the contribution of transport to the \nambient concentrations of fine particle matter is deemed significant, replacing diesel with natural \ngas in transit buses could lead to a significant improvement in air quality. Reduction of pollution \nlevels to the Bangladesh national air quality standards is expected to reduce in the incidence of \ndeaths and sicknesses reported. Improved human health in Dhaka, in turn, is estimated to save \nthe economy about $48 million annually.   \n ", "  3\nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Foreign Exchange Constraints \n10.  Nonavailability  of  foreign  exchange  has  constrained  economic  development  in \nBangladesh. This is especially true for the private sector, which does not have access to foreign \nexchange credits. Hence, saving foreign exchange by substituting domestic goods and services \nfor imported ones is a high priority in the country\u2019s economic policies. Both the Government and \nthe private sector strongly supported substituting domestic natural gas for imported diesel and \npetrol as a measure that will release additional foreign exchange for domestic business. \n \n2.  Program to Improve Air Quality in Dhaka \n11.  Since 1992, significant studies and progress have been made to understand Dhaka\u2019s air \nquality problems. The studies provide a better picture of the contribution pattern of vehicle \nemissions.  Two-stroke engine vehicles, cars/jeeps, and motorcycles are the major sources of \nCO emission, contributing about 37%, 30%, and 24%, respectively. It is also estimated that two-\nstroke auto rickshaws are the main sources of hydrocarbon emissions, with a share of about \n56%. Trucks and buses are significant sources of SO  and SPM. The significant polluters from \n2\ndiesel-fueled vehicles are SPM (including smoke) and nitrogen oxides.  In 1996, the recorded \nconcentration of lead in ambient air over Dhaka was 4.6 milligrams/cubic meter. \n \n12.  Considering the result of random monitoring of air quality in Dhaka as well as the health \neffect of those pollutants, the Government (i) banned the use of leaded gasoline, (ii) regulated \nthe content of sulfur in diesel, (iii) banned the import of two-stroke three-wheelers, (iv) phased \nout auto rickshaws that are more than 10 years old, and (v) has promoted the use of CNG.  \nTraffic  management  is  being  improved  with  support  from  the  WB  through  Dhaka  Urban \nTransport Plan.  In addition, the WB is assisting the Government to strengthen its capacity to \nmonitor air quality and to establish an air monitoring station in Dhaka through the Air Quality \nManagement Project. \n \n13.  Efforts to promote the use of CNG started in 1982 through a WB pilot project under \nwhich Rupantarita Praktritik Gas Company Ltd. (RPGCL) established a workshop for converting  \nvehicles to CNG. The local university \u2013 Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology \u2013 has \nundertaken research to reduce pollution and to achieve maximum economic costs for converting \ntrucks and buses to CNG. A pilot model for converting two-stroke auto rickshaws is being \ncarried out with support from Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) under the \nBangladesh Environmental Management Project. The United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) is involved in a pilot program for conversion of two-stroke auto rickshaws as well as \nsome capacity building for stakeholder. However, conversion of two-stroke engines to CNG has \nhad technical limitations. \n \n14.  Most of these previous efforts have had limited success due to the scarcity of CNG filling \nstations and conversion kits, and low pressure in the filling stations (inadequate supply of \nnatural gas). The proposed Project will address these constraints covering the complete supply \nchain as well as building capacity and implementing equipment safety and emission standards. \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n15.  With  this  Project,  the  Government  will  be  able  to  lay  the  first  major  foundation  of \ninfrastructure and vehicle fleet investments, assuring the market of a sustainable future.   Being \n ", "4   \nthe biggest operator, the current public bus operator, Bangladesh Road and Transportation \nCorporation (BRTC), will absorb the major portion of the initial supply of CNG buses to be \nprovided by the Project. As Executing Agency (EA), RPGCL will procure the vehicles for BRTC \nthrough a leasing arrangement with an intermediate bank that will ensure lease payments to \nRPGCL. BRTC no longer operates its buses by itself, but is leasing them out on a daily basis to \nprivate bus operators. At least 100 of the 300 buses financed through the Project will initially be \nearmarked  for  private  sector  operators.  The  private  bus  operators  will  themselves  handle \nprocurement. Financing arrangements will be similar to those for the public sector through \ncommercial banks and/or leasing companies.  \n \n16.  The  CNG  filling  stations  will  initially  be  implemented  by  RPGCL  in  existing \ndiesel/gasoline filling stations owned by private operators and operated in cooperation with \ngasoline station operators to ensure sufficient training and safety measures based on the \nadopted international safety codes and standards and after an appropriate running-in period. \nThe ownership of the CNG filling stations will gradually be transferred to the private operators. \nWith confidence created through this Project, the Government will encourage private sector \nparticipation to further expand the CNG vehicle fleet in the country as well as in increase the \nnumber of filling stations and workshops for conversion and maintenance.  \n \n17.  To ensure future private sector development, there is a need to implement international \nstandards, reliable pricing, and a rational tax structure. Organizationally, the public sector gas \noperations are already corporatized. However, the boards of these companies do not have \nadequate power to perform their functions in a commercial manner, and this inadequacy leads \nto delayed and bureaucratic decision making. The latter matter is addressed as one of the \nconditionalities for the Project. \n \n18.  Private workshops for conversion and maintenance are already in place, and a major \ninterest is to set up many more CNG filling stations as well as convert cars and taxi fleets to \nCNG. As CNG, without any kind of subsidies, is offering a major price advantage compared with \nexisting fuels, the private sector is only waiting for all the basic criteria and the foundation from \nthis  Project,  such  as  regulations  on  standardized  equipment  and  emission  as  well  as  the \nneeded initial volumes of supply and demand (filling stations and number of vehicles) to ensure \na sustainable takeoff. \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Training \n19.  Successful fuel switching requires that a number of additional conditions be met: (i) \nsufficient incentives for CNG bus fleet operators, (ii) regulatory and administrative arrangements \nin place to ensure the financial sustainability of operators who would use CNG, (iii) proper \nregulatory  framework  including  enforcement  of  safety  and  performance  standards,  (iv) \ntransparent enforcement of existing laws and regulations related to the environment and traffic \npollution, (v) strong and long-term commitment and involvement of the fleet management, (vi) \nextensive  training  and  education  of  mechanics  and  drivers,  and    (vii)  regular  preventive \nmaintenance and prompt repairs. All these issues will be properly addressed in a supporting \ncapacity building and training program for the involved agencies.  \n \n5.  Lessons Learned  \n20.  ADB has been involved in the natural gas sector intermittently over the last 23 years, \nwith six loans totaling $374 million. From its role as a provider of funds for individual projects in the \n1970s, ADB became a provider of funds as well as technical advice for project preparation in the ", "  5\n1980s. In the late 1990s, ADB changed its stance to a more proactive one, providing policy advice \nto the Government in implementing sector reforms. With the significant discoveries made in the \nlast few years, ADB realizes that natural gas is one of the few large-scale indigenous resources \navailable in Bangladesh that, if developed properly, can dramatically improve the economy and \nthe living standards of the people. \n \n21.  Overall macroeconomic/political issues of the country have a significant bearing on the \nsector's performance as well as its ability to reform. Political unrest, labor militancy, enforcement \nof law and order, speed and quality of the judicial processes, and ability of the education system \nto  provide  the  staff  required  for  efficiently  operating  the  sector,  all  affect  the  sector's \nperformance, and there is very little that the sector by itself can do to systematically redress \nthese problems. Thus at any point in time, gas sector development can only proceed up to a \npoint and no further. Forcing actions beyond this point without removing the constraints is futile \nand even jeopardizes the entire reform process.  \n \n22.  Delegation of powers from the Government to the management of the sector entities, \nand from the management to the staff is very limited. Despite efforts by ADB and other sources \ndelegation  has  not  been  sufficiently  enhanced.  The  entities  are  also  restricted  by  the \nGovernment's  personnel  and  wage  policies,  which  inhibit  the  recruitment  and  retention  of \ncompetent staff and the retrenchment or dismissal of excess or nonperforming staff. Since the \ncorporate structure of the sector entities permits such delegations, it is not necessary to create \nnew  sector  entities.  However,  there  is  a  need  to  instill  an  overall  environment  of \ncommercialization in the sector, and to distance operations, ownership, regulations, and policy \nmaking from each other.  \n \n6.  Performance Under ADB\u2019s Third Natural Gas Development Project \n23.  The only ongoing project of ADB in the sector is the Third Natural Gas Development \nProject3. The project comprises (i) drilling of seven appraisal-cum-development wells in Titas \nand Habiganj gas fields and workover of six wells in Titas and Bakhrabad gas fields;  (ii) adding \ngas treatment facilities in Titas and Habiganj gas fields; (iii) expanding transmission lines; and \n(iv)  expanding  and  upgrading  distribution  networks.  The  original  completion  date  of  31 \nDecember 1999, was subsequently been extended to 31 December 2001. Procurement actions \nhave all been completed, but with significant delays. The delays are attributed to the review by \nseveral layers of authorities in the Government as well as to the subjectivity of ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor selection of consultants, which leaves the selection process open to possible interference. \nThere have been attempts to eliminate Government interference by providing autonomy to the \nboards of directors of the sector companies, and the subjectivity of ADB\u2019s consultant selection \nprocess has been minimized through the use of the newly introduced quality and cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1993. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nBangladesh for the Third Natural Gas Development Project. Manila. \n ", "6   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n24.  The objectives of the Project are to \n \n(i)  increase the sustainable use and supply of domestic natural gas resources in \nplace of imported liquid fuels for the transport sector and thus ease pressure on \nthe foreign exchange reserves of Bangladesh; \n \n(ii)  develop the use of CNG in the transport sector and improve ambient air quality in \nDhaka. This will reduce respiratory diseases especially among the urban poor \nwho are the most vulnerable;  \n \n(iii)  encourage  private  sector  participation  by  (a)  implementing  transparent \nregulations based on international emission standards; (b) providing an initial \nfoundation for further private sector development of the domestic downstream \ngas sector; and  \n \n(iv)  improve  corporate  governance  in  the  gas  sector  companies  by  appointing \nindependent boards of directors and management. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n25.  The Project comprises the following: \n \n1.  Extension of the Gas Transmission Pipeline (Part A) \n26.  To ensure a proper supply and balance in the gas distribution system, an additional \ntransmission pipeline infrastructure is required for the Dhaka region. A 60 km 20-inch pipeline will \nbe constructed between Dhanua and Aminbazar, Savar; and two city gate stations (CGSs) at \nAshulia and Amanibazar, Savar. Alignment of the proposed pipeline is in Map 2. \n \n2.  Extension of the Gas Distribution Network in Dhaka (Part B) \n27.  Presently  in  Dhaka,  there  are  four  CNG  stations  established  by  RPGCL  and  one \nimplemented through a joint venture between RPGCL and a Chinese company. These filling \nstations many times face a shortage of gas supply particularly during morning hours when gas \npressure decreases due to high domestic use. To improve and secure a reliable supply of gas \nto 100 CNG filling stations in Dhaka without overstressing the supply network, a distribution \npipeline infrastructure must be put in place before establishing any new CNG stations. The \nProject, therefore, includes the construction of 97 km of 16-inch, 150 pounds per square inch \n(psig) pipelines for this purpose. \n \n3.  Establishment of CNG Filling Stations (Part C) \n28.  Critical to the sustainable development of CNG for automotive use is a minimum number \nof CNG filling stations distributed all over Dhaka so that consumers are encouraged to convert \ntheir petrol-fueled vehicles. The Project addresses this aspect by establishing 3 major CNG ", "  7\nfilling stations just outside Dhaka, 3 major filling stations along the Dhaka-Chittagong highway \nfor buses, and 20 minor filling stations in Dhaka city for cars and auto rickshaws. The filling \nstations  will  also  have  capabilities  for  repairs  and  services.  Along  with  other  ongoing \ndevelopments in the private sector, this Project will meet the demand in the next 4\u20135 years. \n \n4.  Purchase of CNG-Fueled Buses, Auto Rickshaws, and Conversion Kits for \nPetrol-Fueled Cars (Part D) \n29.  Just as a minimum number of filling stations is necessary to sustain the use of CNG as \nan automotive fuel, there must be a nucleus of CNG-fueled vehicles operating to provide a \nminimum level of business to the CNG filling stations, as well as to demonstrate the technical \nand  commercial  viability  of  operating  CNG  vehicles.  The  Project,  therefore,  supports  the \npurchase  of  300  CNG-fueled  buses  for  the  public-private  sector  for  intracity  and  intercity \ntransport to replace the same number of existing diesel-fueled buses in Dhaka, 2,000 CNG-\nfueled  four-stroke  auto  rickshaws  to  replace  the  same  number  of  existing  two-stroke  auto \nrickshaws, and conversion kits for 10,000 petrol cars owned by Government, semi-Government \nagencies, as well as private owners. \n \n5.  Workshop Facilities (Part E) \n30.  To  implement  the  projected  increase  in  the  number  of  conversions  and  future \nmaintenance, major need is to increase the capacity of workshops for conversion, repairs, and \nmaintenance as well as to establish referral workshops. While the private sector will set up \nadditional workshops, RPGCL will have to establish referral workshops to set standards and \nmonitor compliance. Therefore, the Project includes the construction of two new workshops by \nRPGCL. \n \n6.  Capacity Building and Training (Part F) \n31.   This will involve capacity building and training of GTCL and TGTDCL. In addition to make \nthe Project a success, there will be consulting services to RPGCL for some major areas such as \n(i)  development of technology for conversion of non-compressed natural gas-fueled \nvehicles, the repair and maintenance of compressed natural gas-fueled vehicles, \nand the conduct of training workshops \n(ii)  building  the  capacity  of  RPGCL  in  implementing  new  safety  codes  and \nenvironmental management, such as emission standards and regulations related \nto conversion and the use of CNG equipment for the transport sector; and \n(iii)  conduct awareness campaigns on the health benefits of using CNG. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n32.  The Project is estimated to cost $113.4 million equivalent, comprising $81.9 million in \nforeign exchange cost and $31.5 million equivalent in local currency.

Financing Plan \n \n33.  The Project financing plan is in Table 2. ADB and the parallel cofinancing agency, Nordic \nDevelopment Fund (NDF), will be financing only foreign exchange costs associated with the \nProject4. The Government and the sector agencies will finance all local currency costs. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nAgency  Exchange  Currency \nADB         \n  - OCR  30.2    30.2  26.6 \n  - ADF  42.4    42.4  37.4 \nCofinancing-NDF  9.3    9.3  8.2 \nGovernment/ Eas    31.5  31.5  27.8 \nTotal  81.9  31.5  113.4  100.0 \nADB=Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF=Asian  Development  Fund,  EA=executing  agency,  NDF=Nordic  Development  Fund, \nOCR=ordinary capital resources. \n \n34.  It is proposed that ADB extend two loans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh in \nsupport of this Project. The first loan will be for SDR 32.126 million ($42.4 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s special funds resources and will fund parts C, D, E and F(iii) of the Project. The loan \nwill have a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years and an interest \ncharge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s \n                                                 \n4  Nordic Development Fund (NDF) has expressed interest in cofinancing an additional 100 CNG-fueled buses with \nE10.0 million (40 years maturity including 10 years grace period, no interest, 0.75% service charge, and 0.5% \ncommitment fee, and parallel conditions). In the event that the NDF loan will not be approved, part D of the Project \nwill be reduced by 100 CNG-fueled buses. ", "  9\nRepublic of Bangladesh and the proceeds will be re-lent to RPGCL under subsidiary loan \nagreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. Relending terms to RPGCL will \ninclude a repayment period of 10 years including a grace period of 3 years, and interest at the \nrate of 7.5% per annum. The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n35.  RPGCL will procure the 200 buses being financed for BRTC5 and relend the money for \ntheir procurement to Janata Bank with an interest rate of 8% per annum and a term of 7 years. \nJanata Bank will relend this money to BRTC at an interest rate of 12% with a term of 7 years. \n \n36.  For the 100 buses and 2,000 auto rickshaws earmarked for the private sector, RPGCL \nwill progressively relend money to private commercial banks and leasing companies with an \ninterest rate of 8% and a term of 10 years, including a grace period of 2 years. These financing \ninstitutions will be allowed a maximum spread of 3\u20134% to recover their administration and \npossible default payments. Based on current commercial terms, the private commercial banks \nas well as the private leasing companies will be able to recycle financing to the private sector at \nleast twice, which will increase the number of buses as well as boost general private sector \ndevelopment. The flow chart of the financing arrangement for vehicles is in Appendix 5. \n \n37.  The second loan will be for $30.2 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) to \nfund parts A, B, F(i) and F(ii) of the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based variable \nlending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,  and \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan \nAgreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking that the \nchoices were the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh\u2019s own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic \nof Bangladesh. The loan proceeds will be re-lent to Gas and Transmission Company Ltd. \n(GTCL) and Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd. (TGTDCL) under subsidiary \nloan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. Relending terms will include a \nrepayment period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years, and interest at the rate of \n5.5% per annum. The foreign exchange risk will be assumed by GTCL and TGTDCL during the \nlife of the respective subsidiary loans, and thereafter by the Borrower. GTCL and TGTDCL have \nthe capacity to manage the foreign exchange risk as their revenues are adjusted to foreign \nexchange variations. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  EAs will be GCTL for parts A and F(i); TGTDCL for parts B and F(ii); and RPGCL for \nparts, C, D, E, and F(iii). As EA for the public sector under part D, RPGCL will procure buses \nand auto rickshaws and channel them to the public operator (BRTC). In financing the vehicles \nfor the private sector, RPGCL will onlend funds to commercial banks and leasing companies \nthat  will  secure  the  repayment  and  arrange  leasing  agreements  with  the  private  sector \noperators. This recycling of ADB\u2019s assistance will allow the purchase of more vehicles and \naccelerate the elimination of polluting vehicles from Dhaka.  \n                                                 \n5  Of these 200 buses, 100 buses will be funded and procured under the guidelines of the NDF. \n ", "10  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule and Performance Review  \n39.  Implementation has commenced in August 2002 and be completed in December 2006. \nThe  EAs  and  the  Government  will  be  responsible  for  directly  supervising  subproject \nimplementation and monitoring subproject operation performance. The agencies will submit to \nADB quarterly progress reports on their respective responsibilities within 30 days from the end of \neach quarter. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these \nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semiannually to discuss project progress. \nADB will also monitor the overall performance of the EAs. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  Goods  and  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts estimated to cost in excess of \n$500,000 for equipment and related services, and $1,000,000 for civil works will be subjected to \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  requirements,  and  supply  contracts  valued  above \n$500,000  will  be  procured  under  International  Supply.  To  encourage  local  manufacturers, \nsuppliers, and contractors to participate in ICB, ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme may be \nutilized. Contract package are listed in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n41.  International  consultants  (consulting  firms  as  well  as  individual  consultants)  to  be \nengaged under part F of the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. In the case of consulting firms, the quality and cost-based selection method will be \nimplemented. In addition, under ADB\u2019s regional TA: Identification and prioritization of projects in \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) subregion, the Gas Authority of India \nLimited  (GAIL)  will  give  RPGCL  in  advance  of  the  Project  initial  basic  inputs  for  designs, \nstandards, layouts, specifications, and safety regulations and practices on the use of CNG. GAIL \nand its associate companies have successfully introduced CNG for automobiles in Mumbai and \nDelhi in India. \n \n5.  Advance Procurement Action \n42.  GTCL, TGTDCL, and RPGCL (supported by Petrobangla) have sufficient expertise in \nprocuring goods, materials and services for the works entrusted to them under the Project and will \nbe allowed to initiate advance procurement action for the ADB-financed goods and consulting \nservices. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance procurement \naction will not in any way commit ADB to subsequently approve the Project. All such advance \nprocurement actions will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  Since disbursement under the Project will be mainly for supply of goods and consulting \nservices, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be used for the purpose. \nImprest account procedures will be used for the procurement of 100 of the buses and 2,000 of \nthe auto rickshaws under Part D of the Project earmarked for private sector operators. An ", " 11\nimprest account of $2.0 million equivalent in Taka will be established by the Borrower at the \nBangladesh  Bank  (the  Central  Bank)  and  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, dated July 2002. RPGCL may avail of the funds in the imprest account \nand will place part of the proceeds of the account to commercial banks or leasing companies for \nonlending to private sector operators for purchase of buses and auto rickshaws. Subsequent \nwithdrawals from the imprest account will be conditioned upon the production of satisfactory \ndocumentary evidence furnished by participating commercial banks to RPGCL and ADB that the \nfunds have been utilized for the procurement of the buses and auto rickshaws. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  The EAs will maintain separate accounts for the Project, and submit audited project \naccounts and audited financial statements within at least 9 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear. They will prepare separate progress reports for their respective components and submit \nthem to ADB quarterly. The reports will give a narrative description of progress made during the \nperiod,  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  the \nperformance of the project implementation consultants, and the work to be carried out in the \nnext period. The reports will include a summary financial account for the Project, consisting of \nproject expenditures during the period year to date, and total expenditure to date. Project \ncompletion reports will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nProject. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) \n45.  The specific objectives of PPMS are to identify the key criteria and indicators for macro \nlevel monitoring of project inputs, outputs, and impacts.  PPMS will enable the EAs and ADB to \ndetermine the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation, identify constraints, and \nmeasure the performance and impact of the project.  PPMS will be established to assess \nprogress  and  implementation  of  the  project  and  to  measure  impacts  and  outcomes.  The \ninformation gained will be used directly to improve development planning and implementation by \nadjusting delivery mechanisms and identifying more appropriate strategies. In the context of \nDhaka air quality, routine air quality monitoring by the Department of Environment (DOE) will be \nused to indicate improvement in air quality, particularly for oxides of carbon (CO ), nitrogen \nx\noxide (NO), oxides of sulfur (SO ), and suspended particulate matter (SPM). \nx\n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Technical Aspects \n46.  Transmission and distribution pipelines and CGSs will be built as per provisions of \nBangladesh Mineral Safety Rules that are based on American Standards (ANSI B31.8) and \nother international standards. Implementation of the pipeline project will not cause any technical \nproblem as both GTCL and TGTDCL have already done similar projects under WB and ADB \nfunding. Safety codes for the filling stations, conversion kits, CNG cylinders, and vehicles will be \nbased on already existing international standards. Emission standards will be based on existing \nEuropean standards. To ensure successful implementation, internationally proven technology \nwill be used in the Project. \n \n ", "12  \n47.  Many  natural  gas  vehicles  (NGVs)  in  commercial  production  already  meet  future \nparticulate emission specifications to be imposed in North America and the European Union \nduring the latter part of this decade. Therefore, replacing heavy-duty diesel vehicles with natural \ngas  equivalents  is  one  option  for  reducing  vehicular  gaseous  and  particulate  emissions \ndramatically. Urban transit buses are high-usage vehicles that operate in heavily congested \nareas  where  air  quality  improvements  and  reductions  in  public  exposure  to  harmful  air \ncontaminants are critical. Therefore, such vehicles are good candidates for achieving both near-\nterm and long-term emission reductions. That many transit buses are centrally kept and fueled \nmakes the introduction of new technologies and alternative fuels more efficient. In fact NGVs \nare ideal for fleet operations, and the natural gas industry is concentrating on high fuel-use \ncommercial vehicles such as transit buses, taxis, airport shuttles, refuse haulers, and trucks in \nits  market  strategy.  Emission  standards  for  vehicles  purchased  under  the  Project  will  be \nspecified as Euro II and III. \n \n48.  The disadvantages of natural gas include the following: (i) greater difficulty in distribution \nand storage, which makes an existing gas distribution network a prerequisite, (ii) shorter driving \nrange, (iii) greater weight of the fuel tank (gas cylinder), and (iv) higher degree of safety \ncompliance as it is a pressurized fuel. All these aspects have been carefully considered while \ndesigning the Project and adequate training, regulation, and monitoring of enforcement have \nbeen incorporated. \n \nB.  Policy Aspects \n49.  Anticipating further air pollution, since the early 1990s the Government has adopted \npolicies to strategically address the emerging problem in the transport sector.6 However, these \npolicies have not been systematically implemented due to lack of commitment from concerned \nagencies and shortage of funds. The emission standards for motor vehicles are not yet in place, \ntraffic regulation is not well enforced, improvements on the road network have not taken into \naccount air pollution in the city, and the incentive to use clean fuel has not been implemented \nfor lack of a sustainable supply of clean fuel. All these aspects have discouraged the effective \nimplementation of a national policy on the environment and energy. By overcoming the barriers \nto  a  sustainable  supply  of  clean  fuel,  this  Project  is  expected  to  encourage  that  other \nstakeholders to do their part in the action against air pollution from the transport sector. \n \n50.  As a part of this Project, the Government has taken the following actions: \n \n(i)  Based on the right of first refusal, the Government will offer to the private sector \noperators, through a transparent financial arrangement similar to that of the public \noperator, a financing mechanism to purchase at least 100 buses. Furthermore, the \nGovernment has assured that the filling stations will be leased out to, and operated \nby, existing private sector gasoline station owners and eventually be transferred to \nthem  after  a  running-in  period.  Draft  agreement  was  conveyed  to  ADB  on  14 \nOctober 2002. \n \n(ii)  An intermediate financing arrangement between RPGCL and the public and private \nbus operators as well as auto rickshaw operators. Draft agreement was conveyed to \nADB on 14 October 2002. \n   \n                                                 \n6  National Environmental Policy, 1992, Section 3.4 on energy and fuel sector further emphasized by National Energy \nPolicy, 1995. ", " 13\n(iii)  For Janata Bank to be able to provide intermediate financing, the Government has \narranged for BRTC, the public sector bus operator, to settle its current debts to the \nbank \u2013 Tk84 million through an acceptable repayment plan. Letter covering the \nBoard of Directors of the Janata Bank decision to reschedule BRTC\u2019s outstanding \nloan repayment was conveyed to ADB on 14 October 2002. \n \n(iv)  Boards and management of the corporations concerned \u2013 GTCL, TGTDCL, and \nRPGCL \u2013 will be reconstituted to include private sector professionals of standing, \nand provided complete autonomy in operations according to the Companies Act \n1994. The Government has conveyed a letter on 20 October 2002 confirming its \ntime schedule, before loan effectiveness, for the reconstitution of the Boards of \nDirectors. \n \n(v)  The  Ashuganj\u2013Elenga,  Bakhrabad\u2013Demra\u2013and  Bakhrabad\u2013Chittagong \ntransmission pipelines will, based on a firm action plan, be transferred from the gas \ndistribution  companies  to  GTCL.  Vendor\u2019s  agreement  has  been  signed  on  20 \nOctober 2002 for transfer of Ashuganj-Elenga pipeline from TGTDCL to GTCL \nconfirming  physical  transfer  of  all  assets  by  31  March  2003.  Government  has \nconfirmed on 20 October 2002 that vendors\u2019 agreement for transfer of Bakhrabad-\nDemra and Bakhrabad-Chittagong pipelines by BGSL to GTCL will be signed by 31 \nDecember 2002 specifying physical transfer of all assets by 31 March 2003. \n \n(vi)  The Government has ensured that customs, duties and taxes on gas transmission \nand distribution components financed by the project, which are currently between \n50%  and  70%,  will  be  made  uniform  and  substantially  reduced.  Government\u2019s \nnotification was conveyed to ADB on 20 October 2002. \n \n(vii) The Government and its EAs have announced the public disclosure of the \nresettlement plan in the project office and made it available as a reference to \naffected persons. \n \nC.  Institutional Aspects \n1.  Regulatory  and  Institutional  Framework  for  Promoting  CNG  use  in  the \nTransport Sector \n51.  For the vehicles and equipment to be used in the CNG transport sector, European \nstandards and regulations will be implemented. However, efforts to promote the use of CNG   \nneed to go hand in hand with efforts to ensure its safe use in this sector. Therefore, the \nGovernment must have a regulatory and institutional framework to address the issue of safety, \nby at least establishing a certification system for safe conversion of vehicles to CNG, safe \noperation  of  conversion  and  maintenance  workshops  for  CNG  vehicles,  and  safe  use  of \nequipment (especially CNG cylinder tanks), and operation of filling stations to internationally \nacceptable norms and standards. \n \n2.  Downstream Private Sector Projects \n52.  With the Project establishing the foundation for more widespread distribution of CNG for \nthe transport sector in the country, further expansion preferably can be undertaken by the \nprivate sector. The requirements in capital and skills of the transport sector are huge. Only the \nprivate sector can provide such resources on a long-term basis. The Project is an excellent \n ", "14  \nopportunity for public\u2013private partnership. The public sector project components will serve to \nfacilitate  private  sector  participation  by  supplying  inputs,  mitigating  risks,  and  developing \nopportunities.  The  Project  lays  a  solid  foundation  that  will  be  in  place  to  convince  both \nconsumers and private investors of the reliability and sustainability of the new CNG market, \nwhich is a prerequisite for future private development of the sector. The private sector has \nappropriately responded showing interest in financing, marketing, and use of CNG for the \ntransport sector. \n \nD.  Social Aspects \n1.  Poverty Reduction \n53.  Although the Project is not classified as a poverty intervention project, it will indirectly \ncontribute to poverty reduction by reducing household expenditures on health, especially for the \nurban poor who are highly vulnerable.  Through improved air quality, the Project will benefit \napproximately 10 million people in Dhaka, 36.6%7 of whom live below the poverty line. Since the \npoor are more susceptible to air pollution due to the average physical exposure, it is anticipated \nthat the poor will reap most of the economic benefits associated with reduced health problems.  \nReducing SPM concentrations in Dhaka to the national air quality standard will likely result in \nabout 3,580 fewer premature deaths, 10 million fewer restricted-activity days, and 87 million \nfewer days of respiratory symptoms per year.   \n \n54.  The Project will generate about 3,000 person-months of work over the construction \nperiod.  Men and women will have equal opportunities for employment. The vast majority of the \njobs to be created, both temporary and permanent, will go to the poor, as most of the work will \nbe labor-intensive and low-skill. \n \n2.  Social Aspects \n55.  The  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  \u2013  i.e.,  stakeholder  participation,  contract \nspecifications on equal pay for men and women, and prevention of child labor \u2013 are designed to \nfacilitate  more  pro-poor  benefits  and  equitable  distribution.  The  Project  will  adopt  the \nparticipatory  approach  in  implementing  an  awareness  campaign  on  safety  issues  and  the \nbenefits of using CNG. The initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) did not identify any \ncommunities of indigenous people and ethnic minorities that would be adversely affected by the \nProject.  Therefore, there is no need to prepare an indigenous people\u2019s development plan. \n \n56.  The demand for gas has considerably increased in over FY1999/2000 when 47,986 \nconnections  were  commissioned:  117  industrial,  239  commercial,  and  47,630  domestic \ncustomers. With the gradual expansion of the urban areas, demand from new customers will \nalso increase. Although the Project is primarily targeting supply to CNG filling stations, gas will \nalso be distributed to general users. By increasing the supply of gas to domestic customers, \nwomen  and  children  will  benefit  from  improved  indoor  air  quality.  The  detailed  social \nassessment is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n                                                 \n7 The data shows a lower poverty line, which incorporates a minimal allowance for nonfood spending for those who \ncould afford just the food requirement. Poverty lines constructed using the cost-of-basic needs (CBN) method \nrepresent the level of per capita expenditures at which the members of a household can be expected to meet their \nbasic needs of food caloric requirement (2,122 kcal per day and person) and also nonfood consumption. ", " 15\n3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n57.  Part A will not require relocation of any households.  Land comprising 63 hectares (ha) \nwill be acquired for the Project.  Another 90 ha will be requisitioned for temporary use as \nworking space. A maximum of 2,103 households will be affected due to partial loss of land, \nhouses, crops, and trees. The estimated cost for compensation including implementation and \nmonitoring  is  $2.59  million  equivalent.  A  resettlement  plan  based  on  the  100%  census  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement was prepared by the Government and \nEAs in Appendix 8. \n \n58.  The Government confirmed that parts B and C will not require any land acquisition and \nresettlement. For part B, TGTDCL will construct pipelines along existing highways and major \nroads.  Compensation  amounting  to  $0.99  million  equivalent  will  be  paid  to  Dhaka  City \nCorporation for restoring the roadside damaged during construction. For part C \u2013 construction of \n6 major filling stations, 20 minor filling stations, and 2 workshops \u2013 existing sites belonging to \nprivate filling stations and RPGCL will be used. \n \nE.  Financial Aspects \n59.  Parts A, B, F(i) and F(ii), which are proposed for OCR financing sources, show robust \nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRRs). The remaining portions of the Project \u2013 parts C, D, E \nand F(iii) \u2013 that are proposed for financing from ADB\u2019s special funds resources, also have \nrobust FIRRs. Although the new CNG-fueled buses are going to replace the existing diesel- \nfueled buses, the FIRR was computed based on new diesel buses being procured as alternate \nto the CNG buses. The existing buses that are to be replaced are already in such a condition \nthat they should have been phased out and replaced in any case. Based on the considerable \neconomic benefits, but not enough attractive financial incentives for the bus operators, this \ncomponent has to be combined with a gradual ban of diesel-fueled buses for urban transport, \nwhich is one of the conditionalities for the Project. The FIRR for the overall Project is 21%. In \nthe most extreme case \u2013 a 10% increase in capital costs and operation and maintenance costs \nas well as a 10% decrease in volumes and a one-year delay \u2013 the Project will still have a FIRR \nof 16%, which is adequate. The detailed financial analyses for the three EAs are in Appendix \n10, and those for the Project in Appendix 11. \n \nF.  Economic Aspects \n60.  Aside from the significantly lower exhaust emissions, especially of particulate matter \n(PM), one more major reason for switching to natural gas is to diversify energy sources, since \nworldwide natural gas reserves are more abundant than oil reserves. In 2000, the ratio of \nproven reserves to production of natural gas was estimated to be 62 years, and that of oil 38 \nyears. A country that imports oil, but has an abundant supply of natural gas, may find it \nparticularly attractive to consider natural gas as a transport fuel so as to reduce its oil import \nbills. \n \n61.  The Project has two discrete categories of beneficiaries. The first is the users of Dhaka\u2019s \nroads and the second is the nontransport consumers such as household consumers, industries, \nand the commercial sector in the Greater Dhaka area. The latter consumers derive benefit from \nthe additional capacity created from the investments in the transmission and distribution gas \npipelines. Estimating the monetary value of the environmental and health benefits is difficult and \ninvolves subjective value judgments. However, the use of the projected supply instead of other \nfuels and the resultant reduction in pollution level (improvement in air quality) are expected to \n ", "16  \nprovide a qualitative benefit-reducted incidence of deaths and sickness cases reported and is \nexpected to save about $48 million annually to the economy on account of improved human \nhealth in Dhaka. Some studies8 have shown that a general loss in productivity due to air \npollution has an estimated 2% impact on the gross domestic product (GDP). These benefits \nhave not been included in the economic internal rate of return, which is nevertheless high at \n41.9%. The details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 12. \n \nG.  Environmental Aspects \n62.  Overall, the Project is expected to contribute in providing a conducive environment for \npromoting the use of CNG vehicles. The Project is also expected to contribute in improving air \nquality in Dhaka by reducing CO, NO , SO , and PM.  Replacing 300 diesel-fueled buses with \nx x\n300 CNG-fueled buses in Dhaka will reduce bus emissions, particularly PM, by 20% and CO by \n6%.9 Close coordination with the Ministry of Forest and Environment, particularly DOE, to \nmonitor air quality in Dhaka will be part of the PPMS. The summary initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) is in Appendix 13. \n  \n63.  Natural gas as a transport fuel has a number of advantages over diesel: (i) very low \nparticulate emissions; (ii) low emission of airborne toxins; (iii) negligible SO emissions; and (iv) \n2 \nless noisy operation, with less vibration and less odors than the equivalent diesel engines. All \nthese benefits make NGVs especially suitable for urban areas. In addition, life cycle analysis \nsuggests that NGVs emit less of the major greenhouse gases than gasoline-fueled vehicles do \nstill less than diesel vehicles. \n \n64.  Establishing  new  transmission  pipelines  to  transport  natural  gas  from  Dhanua  to \nAminbazar, Savar (60 km); expanding and upgrading the distribution system within Dhaka (97 \nkm); as well as establishing 6 major filling stations and 20 filling stations for distribution will \ncreate some environmental disturbances and impacts during their construction and operation, \nbut  the  impacts  can  easily  be  mitigated.  The  IEE  recommendations  for  mitigating  the \nenvironmental impacts are incorporated into the project design and operating procedures. \n \n65.  The Project will assist the Government in strengthening its capacity to formulate and \nadopt environmental and safety standards for distribution of CNG, establish and operate CNG \nfilling stations, as well as CNG in the transport sector. This effort will lead to the establishment \nof  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  for  using  CNG  in  the  transport  sector.  The \nframework  will  create  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  involvement  in  providing \nservices for safe conversion to CNG vehicles, managing filling stations, as well as maintaining \nCNG cars. \n \nH.  Risks \n66.  Based on lessons learned from similar projects and a separate assessment this specific \nProject, the risks are mainly on (i) supply of natural gas, (ii) regulation, and (iii) long-term \nsustainability based on private sector participation.  \n \n67.  Domestic resources of natural gas as well as an established infrastructure for distributing \nthe gas are essential for successful implementation of a CNG program. Such a supply and the \ninfrastructure facilities already exist in Bangladesh. However, to secure sufficient pressure even \n                                                 \n8 United States-Asia Environmental Partnership. \n9 At present about 1,500 buses operate in Dhaka. ", " 17\nduring peak hours to supply a major increase in CNG filling stations, parts A and B will fund \nadditional transmission and distribution gas pipelines.  \n \n68.  Standards  for  the  CNG  transport  sector  will  be  in  place  well  in  advance  of \nimplementation of the CNG filling stations and the purchase of vehicles under parts C and D of \nthe Project, since the Government has already decided to follow existing international/European \nstandards for its regulations on safety and emission control. The Government and the EAs will \nreceive initial basic inputs for designs, CNG filling station layouts, specifications, and safety \nregulations and practices including mandatory inspection programs, in advance of this Project. \nThis support will be implemented under an ADB\u2019s regional TA10 through the Gas Authority of \nIndia  (GAIL)  and  its  associate  companies,  which  successfully  have  introduced  CNG  for \nautomobiles in Mumbai and Delhi cities in India, based on European regulations and standards. \n \n69.  Private sector participation is essential for the future expansion of the CNG transport \nsector, but not for the success of this specific Project, which is primarily an economic growth \nand environmental and health improvement project. However, private sector participation from \nthe  start  of  the  Project  has  already  been  secured  through  (i)  a  strictly  commercial-based \nintermediate financing arrangement through commercial banks and leasing companies, and (ii) \npurchase and operation of vehicles by the private sector. \n \n70.  Private sector financing institutions, bus operators, taxicab and other car owners, and \npresent and prospective owners of gasoline filling stations and workshops have expressed a \nkeen interest in the implementation of CNG for the transport sector. The private sector is just \nwaiting for the basic foundation covered by this Project, such as (i) a secure supply of natural \ngas, (ii) initial critical number of CNG filling stations, (iii) initial critical number of vehicles to \nprove sustainability, and (iv) regulations and standards on equipment and the use of CNG. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the EAs have given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  During the first year of project implementation, the Government will set and approve \n(a) international standard safety codes related to the CNG filling stations, installation \nof CNG conversion kits; and (b) the use of CNG including emission standards for \ndifferent kinds of fuels. By 31 December 2003, the Government will have instituted a \nmandatory vehicle inspection program to ensure the enforcement of safety and \nemission standards. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  during  project  implementation  and  10  years \nthereafter, there is at all times at least a 50% price differential between the pump \nprice for CNG and for other fuels. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "18  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that each bus or auto rickshaw to be provided under \nthe  Project  replaces  an  old  diesel-fueled  bus  or  two-stroke  auto  rickshaw  for \ntransportation in Dhaka. In each case, the old diesel-fueled buses or two-stroke \nauto rickshaws will be sent out of Dhaka city or scrapped. \n \n(iv)  By July 2003, the Government will have begun a program to phase out all two-\nstroke baby taxis from Dhaka and to replace two-stroke vehicles with four-stroke \nCNG vehicles. The Government will have completed the phase out of two-stroke \nbaby taxis by 31 December 2007. \n \n(v)  The Government will phase out diesel-fueled buses in Dhaka as follows: (a) 25% by \n2005, (b) 50% by 2008, (c) 100% and a total ban of diesel-fueled buses for urban \ntransportation within Dhaka by 2010.  \n \n(vi)  The Government, through GTCL and TGTDCL, will ensure that land acquisition \nactivities are implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations \nand  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the  agreed  upon \nresettlement plan, including (a) acquisition of land and rights-of-way in a proper and \ntimely manner; (b) provision of compensation and entitlements as stipulated in the \nplan and ADB policy to prevail in the case of difference with the Borrower's laws and \nregulations, and compensation to be at replacement cost; (c) timely provision of \ncounterpart funds and disbursements to AP; (d) guarantee to meet unforeseen \nobligations in excess of the budget estimate; (e) adequate supervision, monitoring, \nand reporting by the EA; (f) external monitoring and evaluation by an independent \nagency; (g) dissemination of adequate information  and consultation with AP; and \n(h) regular reporting of progress to ADB. \n \n(vii) The  Government,  through  GTCL,  TGTDCL,  and  RPGCL,  will  ensure  that  all \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  the  environmental  management  plan \ndescribed in the IEE and the summary IEE, both conducted for the Project, are \nfollowed  during  Project  implemented  in  consultation  with  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental requirements as set forth \nin Section 20 of ADB\u2019s Operational Manual, and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment \nrequirements as set forth in Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (Environmental  Division  Office  of  Environment  and  Social \nDevelopment, March 1998). \n \n(viii) The Government, through GTCL, TGTDCL, and RPGCL will ensure that all of the \ncivil works contracts under this Project expressly provide for the contractor to be \nresponsible for, and to carry out, information and education campaigns on sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  and  human  immunodeficiency  virus/  acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome for construction workers as part of their health and \nsafety program at construction campsites during the construction period. \n \n(ix)  The Government, through GTCL, TGTDCL, and RPGCL will ensure that civil works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  for \nchildren in construction campsites. The Government will set employment targets for \nwomen, acceptable to ADB, for pipeline construction activities, and will ensure that \nthe bidding documents and construction contracts expressly require contractors to \nprovide equal wages between men and women for work of equal value.   ", " 19\n \n(x)  With  the  active  participation  of  qualified  representatives  of  civil  society  and  as \nagreed upon with ADB, the Government will develop and implement an adequate \nnumber of public awareness campaigns on safety aspects and benefits of using \nCNG. \n \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that RPGCL selects the private sector participants \nunder the Project in accordance with procedures and criteria agreed upon with \nADB.  The Government will submit the procedures and criteria for ADB\u2019s approval \nprior to selection of any private sector participants under the Project.   \n \n(xii) Prior to any onlending by RPGCL under the Project, the Government will ensure \nthat  RPGCL  submits  to  ADB  for  its  review  and  approval,  draft  onlending \nagreements in form and substance acceptable to ADB.  \n \n(xiii) The Government will ensure that the agreement for financing arrangements for the \nprivate sector participation for at least 100 CNG buses between RPGCL and the \nintermediate financing institutions shall be signed, as acceptable to ADB, within not \nmore than one month of the Effective Date. \n \n(xiv) The Government will ensure that agreements for purposes of setting up the CNG \nfilling stations, between RPGCL and such number of private owners of gasoline \nstations as acceptable to ADB, shall be signed, as acceptable to ADB within not \nmore than six months of the Effective Date. \n \n(xv) In order to ensure intermediate financing of at least 200 CNG buses by Janata \nBank, the Government willl ensure that the agreement between BRTC and Janata \nBank with regard to the settlement of current debt to of BRTC to Janata Bank for an \namount of not less that Taka. Eighty Four million shall be signed between BRTC \nand  Janata  Bank,  as  acceptable  to  ADB,  within  not  more  than  one  month  of \nEffective Date. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n72.  The Ordinary Operations Loan agreement shall have been duly executed and delivered \non behalf of the Government, and all conditions precedent to its effectives shall have been \nfulfilled. \n \n73.   The subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and GTCL, TGTDCL, and \nRPGCL in form and substance acceptable to ADB (i) will have been delivered to ADB and (ii) \nwill have become effective subject only to the effectiveness of ADB Loan Agreement. \n \n74.  To avoid subsidies, the Government will have increased the natural gas price charged \nby TGTDCL to the CNG filling stations to Tk0.070 per cubic feet. \n \n75.  The Government will have notified to ADB that, the legal and physical transfer of the gas \ntransmission  pipelines  (the  Ashuganj-Elanga,  Bakhrabad-Dema  and  Bakhrabad-Chittagong \npipelines currently owned and managed by TGTDCL and Bakhrabad Gas Systems Limited, \nBGSL) to GTCL, has been completed. \n \n ", "20  \n76.  The  Government  will  have  notified  to  ADB  that  the  Boards  of  Directors  of  GTCL, \nTGTDCL and RPGCL have been reconstituted with inclusion of private sector professionals in \neach board. \n \n77.  The Government will have caused GTCL, TGTDCL and RPGCL to have the full financial \nand administrative powers under the provisions of the Companies\u2019 Act 1994 to be incorporated \nin their respective charters. \n \n78.  The Government will have recruited the management (the Managing Director, General \nManager (Finance) and General Manager (Operations) of the GTCL, TGTDCL, and RPGCL on \ncompetitive basis through open advertisements in the press, as acceptable to ADB. \n \n \nVI.

General Energy Sector Overview \n1.  Bangladesh has a per capita consumption of 200 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe)1 of \nenergy, which is the third lowest in Asia, after Cambodia and Nepal. Most of it is noncommercial \nenergy comprising biomass. Commercial energy is available to about 20% of the population as \nelectricity and to about 8% of the population as hydrocarbons, liquid fuels, natural gas, or \nliquefied petroleum gas.  \n \n2.  Bangladesh has limited hydropower potential because the terrain is flat. The Jamuna-\nPadma-Meghna river system, which runs north to south and then to the southeast, divides the \ncountry into two parts. The country\u2019s proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate), \nis estimated at about 51 million barrels, and total natural gas in place is estimated at 20 - 28 \ntrillion cubic feet (TCF), of which about 16 - 24 TCF is classified as remaining reserves. The \nannual consumption of natural gas in the year 2001 was about 0.372 TCF. The consumption of \nnatural gas in the transport sector, particularly as automotive fuel, is negligible at present and is \nat an initial level. However, there is a good demand for conversion of buses, cars, and baby \ntaxis to CNG vehicles, but a sufficient number of CNG filling stations must be available. In terms \nof generated electricity, about 88% of the total in FY2001 was from gas-fired power plants. \n \nB.  Gas Sector Description \n3.  The natural gas sector is organized under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. \nThe Government, through the ministry, wholly owns and supervises the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, \nMineral  Company  (Petrobangla),  as  well  as  the  various  companies  that  deal  with  specific \naspects of the natural gas business. Petrobangla acts as the holding company for all the other \ncompanies in the sector. As of now, the Government-owned companies operating in the sector \ninclude Petrobangla as holding company; Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL), which is \nthe sole gas transmission company; the Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company Limited \n(BAPEX),  the  sole  drilling  and  exploration  company;  four  gas  distribution  and  marketing \ncompanies \u2013 the Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL), the \nBakhrabad Gas Systems Limited (BGSL), the Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution \nSystem Limited (JGTDSL), and the recently established Paschimanchal Gas Company Limited \n(WESGAS); and two gas production companies \u2013 Sylhet Gas Fields Company Limited (SGFL) \nand the Bakhrabad Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL). The Government has also promoted \ncompanies for the conversion of and use of gas. One is Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company \nLimited (RPGCL), which deals in compressed natural gas (CNG) and conversion of natural gas \nliquids to other usable hydrocarbons. Since 1995, after the award of the production-sharing \ncontracts  (PSCs)  to  international  oil  companies,  four  private  sector  companies  have  been \nengaged in gas exploration and production: Unocal (through acquisition of 100% interest of \nOccidental); Shell (through acquisition of 100% interest of Cairn Energy Plc); joint venture of \nTullow  Oil,  Rexwood  and  Oakland  (current  operator  is  Tullow  through  acquisition  of  80% \ninterest from Rexwood and Oakland); and United Meridien Company. Recently the Government \ninitiated and signed five PSCs with seven more international oil companies. About 20 TCF of \nrecoverable reserves was declared,2 of which about 4.3 TCF has already been extracted over \nthe last 30 years.  \n                                                 \n1  Extrapolated from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report for 1999-2000, which indicates a figure of \n197 kgoe for 1996, with an average growth rate of 0.9 % per annum, over 1980-1996. \n2  As of the Bangladesh Petroleum Potential and Resource Assessment 2001 conducted by the Hydrocarbon Unit of \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. \n ", "24   Appendix 2 \n4.  This increase in gas resources is both an opportunity as well as a threat to Bangladesh\u2019s \neconomy. The capital required for investments in downstream activities is presently limited; \nthus, the benefits that could be derived from this additional gas find are restricted. Under current \nand prospective gas purchase and sales agreements Bangladesh is required to purchase a \nminimum quantity of gas in foreign exchange. This requirement puts pressure on Bangladesh\u2019s \nfragile foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, if this additional gas were not put to productive \nuse, it would represent an unsustainable burden in costs as well as foreign exchange outflow.  \n \n5.  Of the average production of about 900 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD), about 80% \nis from fields owned by the Government and the balance from fields operated by international oil \ncompanies under PSCs. At the present rate of consumption, the country has a reserve-to- \nproduction ratio of over 40 years. \n \n6.  Gas transmission for commercial use began in the early 1960s in the Sylhet area and \nabout 1,300 kilometers (km) of 4-inch through 30-inch transmission pipelines has been laid, \ncovering all the major towns in eastern Bangladesh. Recently, with the construction of the \nBangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna River, gas supply was extended to Serajgonj town and \nBaghabari Power Station in the west. Gas transmission is entirely in the public sector. \n \n7.  Distribution of gas began on a commercial scale in 1968. Since then, over 10,000 km of \n1-inch  through  20-inch  pipelines  has  been  laid,  covering  about  900,000  consumers.  Gas \ndistribution is entirely in the public sector.  \n \n8.  CNG was introduced in Dhaka for use in cars early in 1980. In 1994, four filling stations \nwere established to serve 1,200 vehicles. The obvious economic benefit of using CNG vehicles \nand  the  Government\u2019s  strong  campaign  on  combating  air  pollution  have  increased  public \ndemand  for  CNG  vehicles,  which  leads  to  increased  demand  for  CNG  supply.  The \nGovernment\u2019s program promoting the use of CNG vehicles as one of the efforts to combat air \npollution is already very well accepted by the public. It is now time for the Government to \nprovide a continued and adequate supply of CNG for the transport sector.  \n \n9.  The Ministry of Communications is the ministerial-level agency that is responsible for \ntransportation issues in the country. \n \n10.  The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) is responsible for planning the transit \nsystem and approving routes, approving transit contracts for private operations, and registering \nvehicles  including  testing  for  physical  and  environmental  fitness.  The  Bangladesh  Road \nTransport Corporation (BRTC) is the government-subsidized transit company running buses on \napproved routes. BRTC essentially competes with private bus companies approved by BRTA, \nsince there appears to be little coordinated privatization.  \n \n11.  Although the total number of vehicles in the city of Dhaka is not large relative to the \nhuman population, visual observation of the main arterial roadways suggests high levels of \nambient pollutants due to the density of traffic, poor traffic flow and poor maintenance of \nvehicles. The estimated number of vehicles in Dhaka is in Table A2. ", "      Appendix 2   25\n \nTable A2: Estimated Number of Vehicles in Dhaka in 2000 \nVehicle Types  Estimate \nPassenger Cars including Jeep/Station Wagons and Pickups    83,611 \nTaxis    800 \nBig Buses    1,500 \nMinibuses    6,627 \nTrucks    15,600 \nAuto Rickshaw (Baby Taxis)    66,360 \nMotorcycles    121,156 \nOthers    2,382 \nAll Vehicles    298,035 \n \n12.  The data are based on registration records up to 1999, and that for 2000 is estimated by \nadding the average increase between1998 and 1999. There is a widespread belief within the \nGovernment  that  the  registered  vehicle  numbers  are  low  by  25-50%,  and  that  limited \nenforcement of registration regulations allows a large number of unregistered vehicles to ply the \nroadways. In addition to the motorized fleet of vehicles, there is a significant number (estimated \nat over 100,000) of bicycle rickshaws within the city. Although they are not a direct source of \nemission, the congestion aggravated by such an abundance of nonmotorized transport is a \nrelevant component of the transportation and air quality problem. The most striking aspect of \nDhaka\u2019s air pollution problem is the crowded, smoke-filled streets of the city. Trucks, buses, \nthree-wheel two-stroke baby taxis, and cars create a dense smoke plume that exposes traffic \npolice, roadside vendors, and the public to extreme levels of air pollution. The number of two-\nstroke engine vehicles increased by 60% from 1990 to 1996. \n \nC.  Government Policies and Plans \n13.  The Government policies in the gas sector are summarized below: \n   \n(i)  New exploration and production of gas will predominantly be by the private sector \nthrough PSCs. \n \n(ii)  Gas  transmission  will  be  a  monopoly  of  GTCL.  However,  private  sector \nparticipation will be encouraged through (a) construction of pipelines through \nbuild  own  operate  transfer  contracts,  with  operations  controlled  by  GTCL; \n(b) minority  equity  participation  in  GTCL;  and  (c)  participation  in  the  overall \nsupervision of GTCL's activities. \n \n(iii)  Gas marketing and distribution will be commercialized and gradually privatized. \n \n(iv)  An independent regulatory authority will be established for licensing, tariff setting, \nand regulating of gas transmission and distribution activities. The Government \nwill shortly submit a new law for Parliament's consideration. \n \n(v)  Exports of gas and gas-based value-added products will be permitted after the \nGovernment is satisfied that the future domestic requirements of gas can be fully \nmet.  According  to  recent  discussions  and  public-made  statements,  the \nGovernment  is  inclined  to  make  a  decision  soon  on  gas  exports  purely  on \nfinancial and economic considerations. \n \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n(vi)  Tariffs for nontransport sector use will gradually be rationalized to reflect the \ncosts of service. The Government may subsidize certain consumer categories, \nbut the subsidies will be direct, quantified, explicit, and subject to periodic review. \n \n(vii)  Traffic  flows  will  be  improved  by  drafting  out  a  plan  for  phasing  out  auto \nrickshaws and replace them with larger more efficient vehicles as well as banning \nrickshaws initially on 4-5 major roads so that alternate modes of transport could \nbe arranged to ease public suffering. \n \n(viii)  The Government has already issued notification to phase out all two-stroke baby \ntaxis by July 2003, but implementation has not started. According to the current \nMotor Vehicles Act, the life of 2-3 wheelers is 9 years. In 1998 import of two-\nstroke  vehicles  was  discontinued;  therefore  their  gradual  phaseout  may  be \ncompleted by the year 2007. \n \n(ix)  The Department of Environment has plans for introducing the catalytic converter \nin Bangladesh. This will definitely help in reducing emissions and support the \nchange in fuel quality, i.e., removal of lead and sulfur from gasoline, but it is \nunlikely that the change will occur in the near future. Catalytic converters were \nsupposed to be mandatory for all vehicles in Bangladesh since May 2001.  \n \n14.  The Government strategy is to use natural gas (an indigenous resource) to reduce \nimports of other fuels, reduce pollution, and improve efficiencies. Over the next 10 years, the \nGovernment plans to increase the population's access to gas \u2013 piped gas, liquefied petroleum \ngas (LPG), or CNG from the present 9% to about 20%. The Government also plans to replace \nabout 20% of the liquid fuel-based transportation in Dhaka and other major cities with vehicles \nfueled by CNG, thereby reducing imports of petrol and diesel, and also reducing pollution. All \nmajor power stations except the proposed Barapukhuria coal-based power station, will utilize \nnatural gas as their primary fuel, thus reducing imports of diesel and heavy fuel oil. After \nensuring  availability  of  natural  gas  for  meeting  present  and  future  domestic  needs,  the \nGovernment plans to use exports of natural gas and gas-based products for the macro foreign \nexchange stability of the economy. \n \n15.  The new Government of Bangladesh has expressed urgent interest in a fast conversion \nof all public sector vehicles into CNG systems, for proper use of natural gas and to curb \nenvironmental pollution. Recently the new Government also stressed the need to phase out \ntwo-stroke engines so as to reduce air pollution in the city, increase the number of CNG \nrefueling stations and encourage the private sector to participate in this transition. Furthermore, \nthe CNG refueling facility should be made obligatory when giving permission to set up new \npetrol pumps. The Government has already directed the authorities concerned to complete \nCNG conversion of all two-stroke auto rickshaws in the city within the next 2 years. The \nGovernment is in favor of providing auto rickshaw owners with loans for CNG conversion under \narrangements with leasing companies or banks. \n \nD.  Sector Issues \n16.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  involved  in  the  natural  gas  sector \nintermittently over the last 23 years, with six loans totaling $374 million. From its role as a \nprovider of funds for individual projects in the 1970s, ADB became a provider of funds as well as \ntechnical advice for project preparation in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, ADB changed its stance to \na more proactive one, providing policy advice to the Government in implementing sector reforms. ", "      Appendix 2   27\n \nWith the significant discoveries made in the last few years, ADB realizes that natural gas is one of \nthe  few  large-scale  indigenous  resources  available  in  Bangladesh  that  can,  if  appropriately \ndeveloped, dramatically improve the economy and the living standards of the people.  \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s strategy for developing the gas sector, formulated in consultation with the other \nmajor aid agencies in the sector,3 comprises the following: \n \n(i)  The natural gas industry is a commercial one. Hence all activities and decision \nmaking in the sector must aim to improve commercialization. Critical to this effort \nis the autonomy of the operations of the sector from the social obligations of the \nGovernment. Hence, independent setting of tariffs and regulation, private sector \nparticipation, and distancing of the managements of the public sector companies \nfrom the Government are supported. \n \n(ii)  Nonavailability  of  energy  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  development  of  the \neconomy. Hence, efforts to increase energy coverage for the population must be \naccelerated.  Poverty  reduction  being  ADB\u2019s  overarching  development  goal, \nimplies  support  for  improving  the  poor\u2019s  access  to  natural  gas,  and  cottage \nindustries through carefully targeted interventions. \n \n(iii)  Natural gas is the only commercially viable mineral resource of importance in \nBangladesh and is, therefore, to be utilized carefully to ensure that long-term \nbenefits are recognized and accrue to the majority of the population. Hence, \noptimization of use and appropriate tariffs to ensure distribution of the benefits \nof development  are  supported.  Optimization  of  use  implies  (a)  a  cautious \napproach to exports of available gas reserves to stabilize the economy; and (b) \ndecreasing waste of gas in all segments of the sector. \n \n(iv)  Improved governance is another key issue in the sector since it cuts across all \nother  aspects.  Good  governance  improves  commercialization,  improves  the \ndistributive aspects of development, and reduces waste. Hence, transparency, \npredictability, and accountability in the sector\u2019s transactions are supported. \n \n18.  ADB and other aid agencies in the sector have been in continuous dialogue regarding \nimproving the aspects of governance in the sector, as well as using the sector as an engine for \naccelerating economic growth. The policy dialogue involves issues such as enactment of a new \ngas  law  to  allow  establishment  of  an  independent  regulatory  commission;  private  sector \nparticipation in gas exploration and production; planning for optimized development of the gas \nsector and use of natural gas resources; and improving corporate governance in the sector \nentities, e.g., reconstituting boards of directors, delegating authority, and revising the conditions \nof service for the employees. ADB has given technical assistance for improving operational \nefficiencies,4 preparing a gas master plan,5 drafting a gas law,6 developing a policy on private \nsector participation in gas pipelines and evaluating of options for private sector participation in \n                                                 \n3 The consultative group for the energy sector comprises ADB, World Bank, Government of Germany/ Kreditanstalt \nfuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), Government of Japan/Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Department for \nInternational Development of UK (DFID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID).

Performance Under ADB\u2019s Third Natural Gas Development Project \n19.  The only ongoing ADB project9 of in the sector involves (i) drilling of seven appraisal-\ncum-development wells in Titas and Habiganj gas fields and work over of six wells in Titas and \nBakhrabad gas fields;  (ii) adding gas treatment facilities in Titas and Habiganj gas fields; \n(iii) expanding transmission lines; and (iv) expanding and upgrading of distribution networks. \nThe original completion date of 31 December 1999 was subsequently moved to 31 December \n2002. Procurement actions have all been completed, but with significant delays. The delays are \nattributed to the review by several layers of authorities in the Government and ADB, as well as \nto the subjectivity of ADB\u2019s then applicable guidelines for selecting consultants, which leaves \nthe selection process open to possible interference.         \n \n20.  Many of the covenants agreed upon in the loan have not been implemented. On closer \nexamination, however, it is seen that some of the covenants, such as the one to offload 5 \npercent of the shares in each sector company, are irrelevant to the current reform process since \nthey will not lead to any change in the governance of the sector or of the companies, or to an \nimprovement of sector efficiencies. Similarly, the appointment of one nongovernment director on \nthe board of each sector company will not significantly improve the commercialization of the \ncompany if its board of directors is not granted sufficient autonomy in operation. On the other \nhand, in some areas not covenanted, such as private sector development of gas production, the \nGovernment has progressed far beyond that envisaged by ADB. The important covenant that \nhas not been fulfilled relates to reduction of systems losses in TGTDCL. Action is under way to \nmake structural changes in the company, fragment it into governable entities, and accord \nsignificant managerial autonomy to the board of directors. These developments necessitate a \nshift in ADB\u2019s line of support. A comprehensive set of revised agreements is being prepared as \npart of the policy dialogue under the proposed Gas Sector Development Program scheduled for \nprocessing in late 2002. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1998.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector Identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    Country Poverty Partnership \n  Agreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nAir pollution in Dhaka is a serious public health problem that is growing worse as the population of the \ncity increased from 9 million in 1996 and is projected to be 15.5 million by 2015. Some researches report \nthat suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels in Dhaka are about two times higher than the national \nstandard. Urban air pollution in Dhaka has worsened due to population growth, industrialization, and \nincreased  vehicle  use.  The  health  consequences  of  exposure  to  dirty  air  are  considerable.  The \nincreasing use of diesel in urban transport is environmentally costly because of the higher levels of toxic \nemissions emitted by diesel engines and the consequent health damage. The health effects of exposure \nto SPM include additional cases of premature mortality from respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular \ndiseases, increased prevalence of chronic bronchitis, and upper and lower respiratory tract infections.1 \n \nThe poor usually suffer most from air pollution since they have few choices in where they live and work. \nThe poor such as streetside vendors, rickshaw pullers, pedestrians, etc. are exposed to very high \npollutant concentrations. Furthermore, poor people generally suffer from nutritional deficiencies, and \nfrom infectious diseases due to poor sanitation and overcrowding. They tend to receive medical care of \npoor quality. Each of the factors may render the poor more susceptible to the effects of air pollution. \nWomen and children are particularly affected. \n \nThe Project will benefit approximately 10 million people through improved air quality in the project cities. \nAt least 15% or 1.5 million beneficiaries turning below the poverty line in the project area will benefit.  \nImproving quality of urban air enhances poor people's well-being, protects their health and capacity to \nwork, and reduces their vulnerability to environmental risks. The Project will benefit the poor through \nseveral  channels.  Reducing  SPM  concentrations  in  Dhaka  to  the  Bangladeshi  national  air  quality \nstandard will likely result in 3,580 fewer premature deaths, 10 million fewer restricted-activity days, and \n87 million fewer respiratory-symptoms days per year. The economic benefits associated with these \nreduced health problems may have a value over $48 million These estimates do not account for public \nsafety  and  traffic-related  costs,  soiling,  or  aesthetic  degradation.  The  total  public  health,  material \ndamage, and aesthetic cost of air pollution in Dhaka is likely to be much greater. \n \nThe Project will also create construction job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during the \nimplementation stage.  The Project will utilize about 3,000 workers over the construction of pipelines and \nCNG stations.  Men and women will be provided the equal opportunity for employment positions.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \nThematic: Economic growth \n                 Environmental improvement \n \nThe household income and expenditure survey (HIES) conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics \ngives estimates of both the income and human dimensions of poverty. The latest survey (FY1996) \nestimated poverty for 47% of the population.  Subsequent estimates, based on the poverty monitoring \nsurveys, indicate that poverty incidence has since declined somewhat to about 45%.  Although the \ncountry  has  achieved  significant  progress  in  social  development  indicators  over  recent  years, \nBangladesh\u2019s human development index (HDI) continues to be lower than that of most South Asian \n                                                 \n1 Khaliquzzaman M, Biswas SK, Tarafder Sa, Islam A.: Nature and Extent of Airborne Particulate Matter Pollution in \nUrban and Rural Areas of Bangladesh during 1993-1998. Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Dhaka. 2000. ", "  Appendix 8  37 \ncountries. \n \nBangladesh has one of the highest paces of urbanization among developing countries. The urban \npopulation in Dhaka and in other metropolitan cities have virtually doubled from around 12% in 1993/94 to \n22% in 1995/96. Urban poverty in Bangladesh is due to massive migration from rural areas.  The lack of \nemployment opportunities in the rural areas and other push-and-pull factors are the causes of rural-to-\nurban migration. Although the growth in urban per capita income was much higher than that of rural \nincome, urban income still cannot keep up with the pace of urbanization due to rural-urban migration. As \na result, although the proportion of the urban poor declined in relative terms, their absolute number \ncontinued to grow at a faster rate. The proportion of urban poor to the total poor increased from 9.8% in \n1983/84 to 12.9% in 1995/96, and is expected to grow higher in the future.  According to one estimate, \nthe urban population will rise up to 40% by 2020.2  At the present rate of rural and urban poverty \nreduction, the proportion of urban poor in total poor will be about 25\u201330%.   \n \nHowever, urbanization should not be seen in a negative light. Urbanization has contributed in recent \nyears to the decline in national poverty.  During the period between 1983/84 and 1991/92, for instance, \nthere was a 5% reduction in the national head-count index.  The drop in the rural index was in the order of \nonly 1.7%; in contrast, the urban head-count declined by as high as 17.8% during the period.3  Between \n1991/92 and 1995/96, the same trends occurred: the rate of reduction of urban poverty was much higher \nthan that of rural poverty (21.7% as against 5%). \n \nC.  Participation Process   \n \nStakeholder analysis was prepared as part of the social assessment. Participation strategy: Consultation \nwith stakeholders such as bus and baby taxi passengers, owners of baby taxis and private buses, owners \nof filling stations; nongovernment organizations (NGOs) on microfinance; private sector and government \norganizations; and international aid communities were conducted to find out about demand, affordability, \nneeds, and impact of the Project in reducing air pollution and traffic congestion in Dhaka city. Health and \nsafety awareness campaign on the benefit of using compressed natural gas (CNG) will be implemented \nduring project implementation. The Department of Environment in association with civil society, public \nhealth, mass media, and other government agencies will conduct a public awareness campaign on the \nreduction of air pollution and the use of CNG.                                                                                                  \n \nD.

Background \n \n1.  The proposed Project will create the initial infrastructure for the supply of compressed \nnatural gas (CNG) fuel in Dhaka city and establish the initial critical number of CNG-fueled \nvehicles. It will also contribute to the improvement of Dhaka\u2019s air quality. The Project has six \ncomponents: (i) construction of a 60 kilometer (km) natural gas transmission pipeline between \nDhanua and Savar; (ii) construction of extended natural gas distribution pipelines in Dhaka; (iii) \nestablishment of CNG filling stations; (iv) purchase of CNG-fueled vehicles; (v) establishment of \nCNG workshops; and (vi) capacity building on CNG technology.   \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  Under the Project, land will be acquired for construction of the Dhanua\u2013Savar gas \npipeline. The proposed land, which is primarily open fields, belongs to private individuals. A \nsocioeconomic survey and full census of affected households was carried out for construction of \nthe transmission gas pipeline from Dhanua to Savar; and for two associated city gate stations at \nAshulia and Savar.  The resettlement plan (RP) was prepared based on this social assessment, \nthe full census and the inventory of losses. Some 63 hectares of land to be acquired for the \nProject will affect 2,103 households.  Some damage will occur to crops and trees during the \nconstruction of the pipeline. No households will need to be relocated. \n \n3.  Construction of 97 km 16 inch extended distribution gas pipelines in Dhaka will be \nconstructed along the existing city road. There will be no land acquisition for this component. \nHowever, temporary disturbance will be expected. TGTDCL will provide compensation to Dhaka \nCity Corporation (DCC) and approval from DCC will be submitted to ADB prior to construction of \nthe civil works.  Land belonging to RPGCL and BRTC has been identified and will be used for \nthe establishment of 6 major filling stations and 2 CNG workshops.  Establishment of 20 minor \nfilling stations will be undertaken in the existing gasoline stations in Dhaka city. There are no \nillegal occupants or squatters that might be displaced in these sites. \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n4.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are built on the national law (1982 \nAcquisition and Requisition of Property Act) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995).   The entitlement matrix for the Project is summarized in the table. \n \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \n \n       \n  Definition of Entitled     \nType of Loss/Impacts  Person/Unit  Definition of Entitlement  Application Guidelines \nA.

Landless \nhouseholds,  non-title  holders  and  ultra  poor  will  be  entitled  to  resettlement  and  income \nrestoration assistance of not less than Tk10,000, if they have been occupying the affected land \nprior to the census of APs. After all compensation and other entitlements have been delivered, \nland titles will be transferred from AP to GTCL.  Loss of structures including temporary loss will \nbe compensated at replacement cost in cash. \n \nE.  Consultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism \n \n6.  The feasibility study involved consultations with stakeholders and AP. The Project will \nensure that AP and other stakeholders are informed, consulted and encouraged to participate \nactively during project implementation. The contents of the RP and entitlement matrix will be \ndisclosed  to  AP  and  communities,  before  implementation.  A  grievance  mechanism  will  be \nestablished for the Project. A minimum of 60 days will be given from the initial notification of \nintent to acquire land to the notification to acquire land to enable AP to file objections.  The RP \nhas been placed in the project office for the reference of AP.  \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangements and Monitoring \n \n7.  A land acquisition and resettlement support team will be established within the project \nimplementing unit (PIU), assisted by a domestic social development specialist (18 person-\nmonths).  The team will be responsible for preparing, implementing, and monitoring the RP; \nstakeholder  participation;  and  information  dissemination  and  liaison  with  other  government \nagencies. \n \n8.  The district commissioner, together with a GTCL representative and a representative of \nAPs  will  conduct  joint  verification  of  properties  on  the  affected  land  based  on  the  land \nacquisition plan that will be submitted by GTCL to the deputy commissioner. Construction \nactivities will not begin and land will not be possessed until the APs have been properly \ncompensated.    \n \n9.  A  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  will  be  appointed  to  assist  the  Implementing \nAgencies to deliver supplementary direct and indirect payments to reach replacement cost, and \nother assistance such as one-time cash grant to vulnerable groups. To ensure that AP receive \nfull compensation, a public consultative committee (PCC), which includes a representative of \nAP, will supervise payments of compensation.  The PCC will visit points geographically close to \nthe AP for payments.  \n \n10.   Internally, GTCL will conduct monthly internal monitoring of the progress of the planned \nland acquisition and resettlement activities. The land acquisition officer, in the Office of the \ndeputy commissioner, will assist GTCL in monitoring the progress of land acquisition. The \nexternal monitoring and evaluation agency will be commissioned for annual, midterm, and end-\nterm monitoring and evaluation of these activities. \n \nG.  Cost Estimates and Implementation Schedule \n \n10.  The estimated costs for RP implementation and management amount to Tk144.0 million \n($2.59 million equivalent). A budget amounting to approximately $0.9 million will be paid to DCC \nfor constructing 97 km of the extended distribution gas pipeline along the existing city road.  The \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \ntotal  budget  for  resettlement  and  land  requisition  will  be  $3.58  million  equivalent.  All \nresettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works.  ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n \n1.  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  and  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and \nDistribution Company Limited (TGTDCL) will be the Executing Agencies (EAs) for parts A and \nF(i), and B and F(ii), respectively. Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL) will be \nthe executing agency for the remaining parts\u2013C, D, E, and F(iii). RPGCL will procure the buses \nin part D \u2013 procurement and distribution of vehicles\u2013and channel them to the public operator \n(BRTC) through Janata Bank under long-term lease arrangements. The private sector bus \noperators will procure their own buses, which will be financed with onlending funds provided by \nRPGCL under similar leasing arrangements through commercial banks and leasing companies. \nRPGCL will procure the auto rickshaws and then distribute them to the private sector through \ncommercial financing institutions. \n \n2.  Projections were made based on the actual audited accounts statements for the initial \nyears as provided by the EAs. The revenues were projected with an average increase of 9.75% \na year for GTCL and TGTDCL, and 5-6% for RPGCL based on the current sales plus the \nadditional revenues assumed in the respective financial internal rates of return (FIRRs). Sales \nand expenses were based on the existing pattern of each company. The proposed loans with \nthe proposed interest rates and repayment terms as well as loan outstanding as per the audited \naccounts  were  considered  for  repayment  as  per  the  indicated  schedules.  The  account \nreceivables were adjusted assuming a reasonably effective recovery management compared \nwith the current one so that the accounts receivable is reduced to about 2-3 months revenue. \n \nA.  Gas Transmission Company Limited  \n1.  Organizational Structure and Responsibilities \n3.  GTCL was incorporated as a public limited company on 14 December 1993 under \nCompanies Act 1913. The company was formed with the objective of establishing a balanced \nand reliable national gas transmission network with effective and unified control to ensure the \ntransportation of gas required for meeting the increased gas demand in the country. Gas is \nbeing produced from nationalized gas fields operated by international oil companies (IOCs). \nProduction was about 1,272 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) in 1999\u20132000. GTCL has \ntransported about 3,500 million cubic meter (MMCM) of gas through the transmission pipelines \nand ancillary facilities in that period. GTCL estimates that the average daily gas demand will \nreach a peak of 1,700 MMCFD during 2004\u20132005. \n \n2.  Financial Performance \n4.  GTCL revenue from gas transportation was Tk982.5 million with a net profit of Tk97.4 \nmillion after tax during FY2000\u20132001 as per company\u2019s audited financial account. The debt-\nequity ratio was 69:31 during FY2000-2001.  For the purposes of the financial analysis of the \nProject, a debt- equity ratio of 70:30 was considered. \n \n5.  The  cost  of  sale  and  services  including  depreciation  and  holding  company  service \ncharges works out to about 48% of sales, while financial cost accounts for 42% of the sales \nrevenue, leaving a margin of 10% for the project.   \n \n6.  The total fixed assets net of depreciation stood at Tk10.39 billion and capital works in \nprogress at Tk2.40 billion.  The account recoverable as of 30 June 2001 was Tk516.9 million, \nwhich is about 5 months average revenue. Long-term debts as of 30 June 2001 was Tk7.93 \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nbillion  including  foreign  sources  and  local  source  borrowings  in  the  ratio  of  about  2:1, \nrespectively. \n \n7.  The rate of wheeling charges was revised on 1 January 2002 from Tk0.22 per cubic \nmeter  (CM)  to  Tk0.25  per  CM,  and  was  considered  in  the  projections.  Furthermore,  the \nprojection took into account the proposed investment as per implementation period, interest rate \nto the EA, and its repayment period. GTCL has been making profits during the past several \nyears and expects this trend to continue as well as create adequate cash flows and meet the \nrepayment schedules as per the proposed loan condition. \n \n8.

The financial projection for GTCL was based on the principles discussed in paras. 2 and \n7,  and  investments  derived  from  this  Project.  The  projection  indicates  sound  financial \nperformance over the period of the loan. Being a heavy infrastructure company with long-term \ndepreciation on investments but with manageable operational risks, GTCL is operating under a \nfairly high initial capital expenditure, which is compensated by also high and fairly secure \noperating profit. The return on fixed assets and on average equity is reduced in the subsequent \nyears after the investment and thereafter increases steadily due to the interest burden of new \nloans with revenue flowing only after the completion of the Project. The equity ratio is well above ", "  Appendix 10  45 \n30% during the entire projected period, and the cash flows are reasonably sufficient to meet all \noperating costs and debt and equity service requirements. \n \nB.  Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL) \n1.  Organizational Structure and Responsibilities \n10.  TGTDCL was incorporated under the Company Act 1913 on 20 November 1964, with \nthe objective of transmitting natural gas from gas fields to different areas and distributing it to \nconsumers in power, fertilizer, industrial, commercial, seasonal, and domestic categories of its \nfranchise areas, viz. B. Baria, greater Dhaka, and Mymensingh districts.  After the liberation of \nthe country, the company was nationalized under the public holding company Petrobangla. At \npresent TGTDCL supplies gas to about 700,000 customers including eight government power \nstations, two private power stations, and four fertilizer factories. \n \n2.  Financial Performance \n11.  The published annual report is available up to the year ending 30 June 2000. The \naccount for FY2000-2001 is under audit and is yet to be finalized. The turnover for FY1999-\n2000 was Tk14.64 billion. Net profit after tax was Tk539.1 million. The projected turnover for \nFY2000-2001 is Tk15.71 billion and a net profit of Tk1.02 billion is expected.  The company has \nbeen making profits during the past several years, and this trend is expected to continue as well \nas to create adequate cash flows and meet repayment schedules as per the proposed loan \ncondition. \n \n12.  Long-term borrowing as of 30 June 2000 stood at Tk5.52 billion, which included Tk3.95 \nbillion in foreign sources. \n \n13.  The accounts receivable amounted to Tk6.60 billion against annual sales revenue of \nTk14.64 billion, accounting for almost 5.4 months sale. The debts from the power and industry \nsector are maximum with 30% and 38%, respectively, of the total amount due. A more cash \nflow-focused management is expected and the accounts receivable are expected to gradually \nimprove in the area of 3 months of sales value. \n \n14.  Sales to various sectors during 1999-2000 follow (Table 10.2): \nTable A10.2: Gas Sales of TGTDCL in 1999-2000 \n \nSector   Quantity (MMCM)  Percentage \nPower    3,182.54    52 \nFertilizer    1,259.01    21 \nIndustrial    961.31    16 \nCommercial    69.21    1 \nDomestic    610.44    10 \nSeasonal    8.65    0.1 \n    6,091.16    100 \nMMCM=million cubic meter \n \n15.  During the discussion, it was noted that the sale price of natural gas (NG) of Tk1.52 per \ncubic meter (CM) to RPGCL is not adequate and does not cover the cost. Based on this, the \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nProject has conditioned a tariff increase on the portion of gas sold to the compressed natural \ngas  (CNG)  filling  stations,  which  is  included  in  the  computations.  Aside  from  this  specific \nassumption,  the  projection  took  into  account  the  general  assumptions  from  the  proposed \ninvestment as per implementation period, interest rate to the EA, and the repayment period.  \n \n16.

The financial projection for TGTDCL is based on the principles discussed in paras. 2, 7, \n14, 15, and 16 and investments derived from this Project. The projection indicates a sound \nfinancial performance over the term of the loan. The equity ratio is well above 30% during the \nentire projected period, and the cash flows are reasonably sufficient to meet all operating costs \nand debt and equity service requirements. \n \nC.  Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL) \n1.  Organizational Structure and Responsibilities \n18.  RPGCL was incorporated as a public limited company under Company Act 1913 on 1 \nJanuary 1987 under the public holding company Petrobangla. A study of the technical, financial, \nand economic feasibility of converting gasoline and diesel auto engines to use CNG was carried \nout and a small pilot conversion program under World Bank funding was undertaken in 1982\u2013\n1985.  As  a  result  of  that  study,  RPGCL  was  established  to  undertake  the  business  as ", "  Appendix 10  47 \nmanufacturers/producer  and  dealer  of  natural  gas  liquids  (NGL),  CNG  and  other  related \nproducts. \n \n2.  Financial Performance \n19.  The company\u2019s annual reports show that it has been in the business of converting \nvehicles since 1983/84. During FY1997/98, RPGCL converted a maximum of 678 vehicles. \nThereafter the number converted each year declined steadily to 52 vehicles only in FY2000/01.  \nConverted vehicles totaled 1,500 as of 30 June 2001. \n \n20.  During FY2000-2001, RPGCL made a net profit after tax of Tk24.0 million as against the \nloss of Tk18.8 million in FY1999-2000. The company had been incurring losses in the previous \nyears  and  FY2000-2001  was  the  first  year  when  it  turned  the  corner.  After  2  years  of \nimplementation  and  increased  financial  expenditures,  it  is  expected  that  the  company  will \ncontinue to make a profit. \n \n21.  As of 30 June 2001, long-term borrowing of Tk380.2 million was outstanding. It included \namounts borrowed from the development project fund of the Government of Bangladesh to the \nextent of Tk296.9 million and a foreign source loan of Tk83.3 million. The fixed assets at cost \nless depreciation stood at Tk333.5 million and capital work in progress at Tk116.6 million. \n \n22.  Accounts receivable amounted to Tk393.1 million as of 30 July 2001. It represents a \nyear\u2019s income, which is considered very high. Such a huge outstanding was attributed to large \namounts receivable from Government agencies. Out of the total sales income of Tk381.8 million \nduring the year FY2000-2001, income from the sale of CNG was Tk15.5 million, amounting to \nabout 4% only. With this Project, sales are expected to gradually increase to the amount of \nTk800 million. It is assumed that greater efforts in cash management will gradually reduce \naccounts receivable. \n \n23.  The  gas  sold  for  CNG  from  TGTDCL  to  RPGCL\u2019s  filling  stations  has  so  far  been \nsubsidized. The Project has imposed as condition a tariff increase on the portion of gas sold to \nthe filling stations, which is included in the computations.

The financial projection for RPGCL was based on the principles discussed in para.2, 23 \nand 24, and investments derived from this Project. The projection indicates sound financial \nperformance over the term of the loan. After a short decline during the initial phase of the project \nimplementation, the equity ratio will recover to a healthy level of 30% and above. The cash flows \nare reasonably sufficient to meet all operating costs and debt and equity service requirements. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  and  on  an \nincremental basis by comparing with-project and without-project scenarios. The project cost \nestimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting \nfor the effects of fluctuating foreign and domestic inflation. \n \nA.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n2.  For estimating the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), the total project was divided \ninto four segments: (i) gas transmission pipelines; (ii) gas distribution pipelines; (iii) vehicles \nincluding compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, auto rickshaws, and conversion kits for petrol \ncars; and (iv) filling stations and workshops. The assumptions for the different segments are \ndiscussed in the following paragraphs. The rate of exchange was assumed as $1.00 = Tk58.50. \n \n1.  Gas Transmission Pipeline \n \n(i)  The revenue was calculated at a rate of Tk250 per million cubic meter \n(MMCM) as per the rates in force on 1 January 2002. \n(ii)  The pipeline is of 20-inch diameter with inlet pressure of 800 psig, outlet \npressure of 350 psig, and annual gas output increasing gradually from \n625  MMCM  in  2005\u20132006  to  2,085  MMCM  in  2017\u20132020  as  per \nestimation given by Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) in its \nproject report. \n(iii)  No transmission losses were considered. \n(iv)  The operating cost was assumed as Tk6.55 million, from GTCL\u2019s project \nreport. \n(v)  Income tax at 40% was assumed after providing for depreciation at 3.3% \nbased on GTCL\u2019s account. \n(vi)  The calculated FIRR is 12%. \n \n2.  Gas Distribution Pipelines \n \n(i)  A gradual increase in annual gas sales was assumed from initially 270 \nMMCM  in  FY2005  to  its  maximum  capacity  of  1,030  MMCM  (2.85 \nMMCMD for 360 days), from FY2012 onward in total of which 90% was \nfor general use and 10% was for vehicular use under the Project. \n(ii)  The charges for general gas use were assumed at an average of Tk4.34 \nper  CM  as  per  current  rates  for  domestic  and  commercial  customer \ngroups. The charges used for vehicular use were assumed at Tk2.45 per \nMMCM to achieve a minor margin on this portion as well. \n(iii)  The wheeling charges payable to GTCL at 250 MMCM was considered \nalong with operating and other costs. \n(iv)  Cost of gas procured was considered at current rate, Tk3.146 per cubic \nmeter (CM) calculated while taking the weighted average of domestic, \ncommercial, and vehicular tariffs at present. \n(v)  The calculated FIRR is 23%. \n \n \n \n \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \n3.  Filling Stations and Workshops \n \n(i)  The workshops are added as additional investment without any additional \nrevenues. \n(ii)  Cost of gas purchased was assumed at Tk2.45 per CM. \n(iii)  The  operating  cost  including  electricity  consumption  and  dealer \ncommission of 0.36 per CM of CNG was assumed totally as Tk2.86 per \nCM of CNG. This includes electricity consumption of Tk1.00 and dealer \ncommission of Tk0.36 per CM.  \n(iv)  Sales price was based on the current average price of Tk7.45 per CM. \n(v)  The quantity of gas shown in the statement in respect of distribution line \nproject was considered. \n(vi)  The calculated FIRR comes out at 14%. \n \n4.  Vehicles \n \n 3.  Since the 300 CNG buses will replace existing operating diesel buses, it was assumed \nthat the revenue and general operating and other expenses would remain the same except for \nsavings in the cost of fuel and some minor savings in maintenance costs. The cost benefits \nwere assumed as projected in the S. H. Lucas & Associates (SHL) report based on Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC\u2019s) study of CNG for vehicular use (January 2000). Hence \nincremental savings in cost were considered. A similar treatment was given to autos and \nconversion of petrol-driven vehicles using the cost savings as taken in the SHL report. The \nassumptions are as follows: \n \na.  For Buses \n \n(i)  Retail cost of diesel equivalent to that for 1 CM of CNG, Tk15.95 \n(ii)  Retail price of CNG per CM, Tk7.45 \n(iii)  Total km per day, 270  \n(iv)  Range per CM CNG or per liter diesel, 2 km \n(v)  Cost-benefit per km (15.95\u20137.45)/2, Tk4.25 \n(vi)  Operating days per year, 324 \n(vii)  In  addition  to  fuel  savings,  a  customer  preference  benefit  of \nTk371,790 per bus and year is expected, as per SHL report, but \nwas not considered in this case. \n \nb.  For Auto Rickshaws \n \n(i)  Retail price of petrol, Tk28 per liter \n(ii)  Retail price of CNG, Tk7.45 per CM \n(iii)  km per day, 20 for petrol cars and 25 for CNG cars \n(iv)  Cost of oil per km for petrol vehicle, Tk0.19 \n(v)  Cost of oil per km for CNG vehicle, Tk0.04 \n(vi)  Savings in oil per km, Tk0.15 \n(vii)  Fuel cost-benefit per km, Tk1.102 \n(viii)  km per day, 126 \n(ix)  Operating days, 350 \n(x)  Annual  savings  including  savings  in  oil  and  maintenance  per \nvehicle, Tk59,920 \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nc.  For Conversion Kits \n(i)  Conversion cost including kit and conversion per unit, Tk40,000 \n(ii)  km per day, 80 \n(iii)  km per liter of petrol, 8 \n(iv)  km per CM of CNG, 10 \n(v)  Operating days per year, 350 \n(vi)  Cost of petrol per km 28/8, Tk3.50 \n(vii)  Cost CNG per km 7.45/10, Tk0.745 \n(viii)  Fuel cost-benefit per km, Tk2.755 \n \n4.  The different kinds of vehicles, buses, auto rickshaws, and conversion of petrol cars \nwere analyzed individually as well. As expected, replacing diesel for buses is financially a bigger \nchallenge, as diesel is an already favorable low-taxed fuel because of its use in the transport \nand agriculture sectors. However, computing with the marginal cost for the more expensive \nCNG buses without computing any revenues from the transport operation itself aside from \nsavings in fuel and slightly lower maintenance costs, the buses still have a fairly robust FIRR of \n19%. Auto rickshaws, conservatively computed as full investment with minor scrap value for the \nreplaced vehicles, have a FIRR of 15%. Petrol cars, with the conversion kits and conversion \ncost as sole investment and a major fuel savings, reach a high FIRR of 77%. The average FIRR \nfor vehicles is 44%. \n  \n5.  Consolidated Project \n \n5.  Besides the analyses of the four segments, a consolidated FIRR was also computed for \nthe entire Project. The overall FIRR is 21%. \n \nA.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n6.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated in real terms based on the \nactual expected capital composition for each segment of the Project. The relending rate for the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loans and for the cofinancing by Nordic Development Fund \n(NDF) were calculated at 7.5% and adjusted for taxes of 40%. The loans in local currency were \ncalculated at 9.25% and adjusted for taxes as well as for domestic inflation of 4.5%. The equity \nportion (30%) of the domestic funds was calculated at 15% and adjusted for domestic inflation \nas  well.  Where  applicable,  the  minimum  rate  test  was  used  according  to  the  new  ADB \nguidelines. Based on these assumptions, the WACC for the different segments was computed: \n \n(i)  Transmission gas pipeline \u2013 4.47% \n(ii)  Distribution gas pipeline \u2013 4.80% \n(iii)  Filling stations and workshops \u2013 4.62% \n(iv)  Vehicles \u2013 5.16%, if computing with higher onlending rate through intermediate \ncommercial banks \n(v)  Consolidated Project \u2013 4.51% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nB.  Sensitivity Analysis \n7.  Table A11 gives the results of the sensitivity analyses of the FIRRs under various \nfollowing scenarios. \n \nTable A11: Sensitivity Analyses \n  Financial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n \n \nScenario  Transmission Distribution  Filling Stations  Vehicles  Total \nBase Case    12  23    14  44  21 \n1.  10% Increase in Capital Cost     11  21    13  39  19 \n2.  10% Increase in O&M Costs     12  22    12  44  21 \n3.  10% Decrease in volume     11  20    14  44  20 \n4.

Except for the transmission gas pipeline and the filling station segments, the sensitivity \ntest found a comfortable switching value for a 10% increase in capital cost, 10% increase in \noperation and maintenance (O&M) cost, 10% decrease in volume as well as a 10% decrease in \ntariffs for all segments. The filling stations were a little bit more affected by the combination of all \nfour occurrences, from a FIRR of 14% in the base case to 7%, still above the WACC for this \ncomponent of the Project. To make the filling stations financially more attractive to the private \nsector, the Government is considering an increased margin for this part of the CNG value-added \nchain. This is an extreme case and the probability of its occurring is very remote. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n9.  The FIRR is expected to comfortably exceed the WACC for each project component as \nwell as for the consolidated Project (both computed on an after-tax basis). Given the overall \nobjectives of the Project, the financial performance is deemed acceptable.  ", "  Appendix 12  53 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The economic benefits from the proposed Project were considered under two broad \ncategories: transport and nontransport components. Analysis was carried out in line with the \nstandard cost-benefit analysis framework. Besides direct benefits accruing to the economy, \nother benefits such as savings in foreign exchange, health benefits, etc, were also considered \nfor qualitative appraisal of the Project. \n \nA.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n2.  As the proposed grid expansion is only in the area of Greater Dhaka, the potential \nconsumers of the projected gas supply may be grouped in two discrete categories: (i) the \ntransport vehicles that will run on compressed natural gas (CNG), and (ii) the nontransport \nconsumers such as the commercial sector and household consumers in the Greater Dhaka \narea. The economic analysis will identify the benefits for each category and assess the overall \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \n \n3.  The projected capacity of the distribution pipelines is estimated at 100 million cubic feet \nper day (MMCFD) of natural gas. As the number of vehicles to be procured by the Project will \nutilize only 4.15 MMCFD of 10 MMCFD gas available for the transport sector, benefits in terms \nof full resource cost savings from this portion are included in the analysis. Benefits from the \nremaining transport portion, 5.85 MMCFD, are included less net cost of additional conversion to \nCNG by private bus and auto rickshaw operators as well as private car owners. All these \neconomic benefits are nonincremental in nature. \n \n4.  The remaining capacity arising from the Project, i.e., 90 MMCFD of natural gas for the \nnontransport component, was assumed to be supplied to only households and commercial \nconsumers in the Greater Dhaka area. Discussions with the Executive Agencies (EAs) revealed \nthat the proposed Project would help improve the supply pressure during peak hours, which in \nturn will create an incremental demand for about 15 MMCFD of gas by the existing consumers.  \nEconomic benefits from the nontransport component were considered nonincremental benefits, \nas new customers as well as existing customers will replace existing fuels with natural gas.  \n \n5.  The economic as well as financial viability of the Project depends mainly on the demand \nfor gas by new consumers. The demand for gas was projected keeping in view the existing \nconsumption  level  per  household  plus  annual  growth  in  terms  of  new  connections,  as \ncommunicated by the EAs. Growth in the number of new connections was taken as 10% per \nannum during the period 2005\u20132010 and as 6% thereafter. The demand projections with these \ninput parameters indicate that the full projected supply of gas will be consumed in the year 2012 \nand beyond.  \n  \n6.  Nonincremental benefits for commercial and household consumers were valued in terms \nof resource cost savings. The fuels replaced by gas were assumed to be diesel and kerosene, \nrespectively, and the savings in resource cost comprised the differential in economic cost of \ndiesel  and  kerosene  used  by  commercial  and  household  consumers  respectively  and  the \neconomic cost of gas that would replace those fuels. As the current supply of gas is inadequate \nand pressure is low during peak hours, the benefits for existing customers were also valued in \nterms of resource savings in replacing diesel and kerosene, which are still used as emergency \nfuels. Therefore, no major incremental benefits are expected from the Project. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n7.  The economic cost of the Project components was based on the total project cost \nestimates, less taxes, duties, price contingency, and interest during construction (IDC).  \n \n8.  The annual maintenance costs of vehicles used were based on Barwood Cab Fleet \nStudy conducted by the US Department of Energy. The cost of operating and maintaining the \ntransmission and distribution pipelines was based on actual and budgeted figures from Gas \nTransmission Company Limited (GTCL) and Titas Gas Transmission and Distributing Company \nLimited (TGTDCL). \n \n9.  The  economic  costs  of  the  various  categories  of  fuels  are  given  in  Table  A12.1.  The \neconomic cost of CNG was based on the report of the resettlement plan (RP) Gas Company \nLimited, Dhaka, and that for other fuels was based on border prices plus transportation cost. No \ndepletion premium was considered for CNG, as the available gas resources of the country are \nlarge and at the current rates of consumption are expected to last far beyond the life of the \nProject. Even if computed, the depletion premium will be a very small and insignificant cost.   \n \nTable A12.1: Retail Prices and Economic Cost of Fuels \n(Tk) \nFuel  Retail Price  Economic Cost \nNatural gas (per CM)    4.04 and 7.25a    1.97 \nCNG (per CM)    7.45    3.35  \nPetrol (per liter)    30.00    27.00 \nDiesel (per liter)    17.00    15.30 \nKerosene (per liter)    20.00    18.00 \nCM=cubic meter, CNG=compressed natural gas \na Retail price of natural gas is Tk4.04 for household consumers and Tk7.25 for commercial consumers. The \neconomic cost of natural gas for the two categories of consumers was calculated by taking the weighted average of \nthe economic cost of gas to these consumers, with the proportionate share in the supply of gas being weights. \n \n \n10.  Assumptions regarding consumption, distances covered per day, number of operating \ndays were based on a study of Dhaka city by S.H. Lucas & Associates, with minor adjustments.  \n \n11.

Projections by the power system master plan (PSMP) put the likely growth in demand for \nenergy at 10% per annum. Assuming the same rate for petrol and diesel, calculations reveal \nthat demand for these energy products is going to be five times after 15 years. Keeping in view \nthe current import bill of the country for these fuels,1 and limited available reserves of petroleum \nand exploration activities, domestic production is not going to meet this increasing demand. To \nmeet this demand, the Government has two options: (i) increase imports, or (ii) replace the use \nof these fuels by domestically produced natural gas. The first option is not affordable to the \ncountry. In 1995/96, 1.01 million metric tons (t) of diesel valued at $183 million was imported. \nAssuming that the ratio between imported fuels and domestic production remains the same as \nat present, and demand growth is as predicted by PSMP, the likely quantum of import of diesel \nalone will be about 6.70 million t in 2015. Considering the existing level of imports of these \nproducts and limited opportunities in increasing exports, Bangladesh cannot afford to depend on \nimported energy fuels to meet the increasing demand. The international reserves of Bangladesh \nhave been declining in recent years.2 \n                                                 \n1  The payment on account of import of crude petroleum and petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) was $273.0 million \nand $44.0 million respectively, for the period July 2000 to June 2001 (source: Bangladesh Bank). \n2  In 1994/95, these reserves were $3,069.6 million, but came down to $1,602.1 million in 1999-2000 and further fell \nto $1,085.4 million in October 2001. \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n \n14.  The other viable option is to replace petrol and diesel with natural gas as a fuel in \nindustry and transport. Since the replacement of diesel with gas is a gradual process and will \ntake a few years to fully materialize, the savings in foreign exchange will be smaller in the initial \nyears. But after 4-5 years, such savings will pick up. Thus, import substitution will save the \ncountry foreign exchange of about $90 million in 2005, which will increase to about $330 million \nin 2010. \n \n15.  Any development in the gas system has a significant bearing on the environment of the \narea. Environmental impacts may be in terms of land acquisition, natural hazards, surface water \ndisturbances, etc. In practice, it is very difficult to estimate and quantify the environmental \nimpacts of any human activity; however, these environmental impacts can be managed through \nan appropriate environmental management plan (EMP).  \n \n16.  The major positive impact of the Project on the environment will be reduced air pollution, \nwhich in turn will results in improved human health. The human health effects include both \nmortality and morbidly impacts. The current air pollution level in Dhaka is striking. For example, \nthe level of suspended particulate material (SPM) in Dhaka ranges from 600 to 2,000 \u00b5g/m3, \nwhile the standard value for commercial and mixed areas is 400 \u00b5g/m3 and developed countries \nstandard is 240 \u00b5g/m3. If the current levels of pollution in the country\u2019s four principal cities were \nto be hypothetically reduced to those of the developed countries level, as many as 15,000 \ndeaths, a million cases of sickness requiring medical treatment, and 850 million cases of minor \nillness could possibly be avoided annually.3 But the Project neither aims to nor is expected to \nimprove pollution levels to the standards in force in developed countries. However, the Project is \nlikely to bring about some major improvement in the quality of air in Dhaka because the main \ncause of air pollution is traffic. Gas-based vehicles are comparatively less polluting. Simple \ncalculations show that projected vehicle conversions to CNG (under the Project as well as \noutside it) may replace more than about 11% of the existing fleet of various categories of \nvehicles and thus can reduce the pollution level in Dhaka by about the same proportion. Thus \nthe projected use of gas in place of other fuels and the resultant reduction in pollution level \n(improvement in air quality) are expected to provide the qualitative benefit of reduced incidence \nof deaths and sickness cases reported. In turn, this reduction is expected to give savings of \nabout $48 million annually to the economy on account of improved human health in Dhaka. It is \nrelevant to mention that benefits from human health were estimated but not considered in \ncalculating of the EIRR. The estimation is only for the qualitative appraisal of the Project. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n17.  Although it is difficult to exactly calculate the benefits (contribution in output of the \neconomy) due to investment in the Project, the estimates are encouraging. Besides the direct \nbenefits from the Project, other benefits \u2013 as savings in foreign exchange due to replacement of \nimported fuels with domestically produced natural gas, and health benefits due to reduced air \npollution \u2013 are significant. Thus, keeping in view the objectives of the Project, i.e. economic \ngrowth and environmental and health improvement, the Project is economically robust.  \n                                                 \n3  Shah, Jitendra. 2001.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Dhaka Clean Fuel Project is categorized as a B Project in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guideline on Environmental Assessment. An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nwas prepared. This appendix is based on information in the IEE reports prepared by the \nGovernment.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The proposed Project will involve (i) the construction of 60 kilometer (km) of 20-inch gas \ntransmission pipelines from Dhanua to Aminbazar, Savar; (ii) 97 km expansion of the existing \n16-inch  gas  distribution  network  within  the  Dhaka  area;  (iii)  establishment  of  6  major \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations (3 stations in the suburbs of Dhaka and 3 along \nthe  Dhaka-Chittagong  highway)  and  20  minor  CNG  filling  stations  within  Dhaka  city;  (iv) \npurchase of 300 CNG buses, 2,000 CNG baby taxis (auto rickshaws), and 10,000 conversion \nkits to convert Government vehicles to CNG vehicles; (v)  capacity building, which includes  \nestablishing a regulatory framework and its infrastructures to implement safety  in CNG use  in \nthe transport sector; and (vi) establishment of referral workshops for converting and maintaining \nCNG vehicles                          \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The Project is located mostly in Dhaka; however, the gas transmission pipeline and six \nmajor CNG filling stations are located outside and in the suburbs of Dhaka. The environmental \nconditions of the area involved in the Project are briefly described. \n \n1.  Area Affected by Establishment of Filling Stations, Distribution Networks, \nProcurement  of  CNG  Vehicles,  and  Establishment  of  Maintenance \nConversion Workshops  \n \n4.  Dhaka city is the main area affected by the project activities. The area is topographically \nflat delta. Four major rivers cross the city: Sitalakhya, Buriganga, Meghna, and Jamuna. Most of \nthe city is flood-prone. The total land area is about 360 square kilometers (km2). The population \nin 2000 was estimated to be about 8 million; the population density was about 220 people per \nkm2. \n \n5.  Transportation in the city is mainly road-based. The major road is about 310 km long and \nminor roads measure about 2,690 km. The number of motor vehicles increased significantly \nfrom about 80,000 in 1992 to 110,000 in 1996. Besides the pressure from rising traffic levels, \nseparated  road  junctions  are  few  and  traffic  congestion  at  many  key  junctions  cannot  be \navoided.  \n \n6.  The inhabitants of Dhaka suffer from air pollution associated with the transport system, \nparticularly  due  to  the  high  Sulfur  content  of  diesel  and  lead  in  gasoline.  The  ambient \nconcentration of SO  ranges from 130 to 180 microgams per cubic meter \u00b5g/m\u00b3, NOx ranges \n2\nfrom 50 to 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, and the suspended particulate matter (SPM) level ranges from 600 to \n2,000 \u00b5g/m\u00b3.  Buses and trucks are significant sources of sulfur dioxide (SO ) and suspended \n2\nparticulate  matter  (SPM),  while  auto  rickshaws  are  the  main  source  of  hydrocarbon  (HC) \nemission.    \n ", "58  Appendix  13 \n2.  Area Affected by Gas Transmission Pipelines  \n \n7.  The project area is mostly located in Dhaka and Gazipur District. The gas will be \ntransported from Dhanua gas station in Gazipur District. The pipeline will cross one river and \none canal, one main road connecting Joydebpur to Jamuna Bridge, and three other rural roads. \nAreas that will be affected by the gas transmission alignment are agricultural land, vacant land, \nand  settlement  area.  Sites  for  the  temporary  storage  of  construction  equipment  and  used \npipelines  are  in  four  small  towns  (Mirzapur,  Kadda,  and  Birulia).  The  alignment  of  the \ntransmission pipelines will affect no environmentally sensitive areas.   \n   \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Impacts of the Introduction of CNG Vehicles \n \n8.  About 1,500 buses, mostly diesel-fueled, are operated by public and private operators to \nserve Dhaka city. Replacing of one diesel bus with one CNG bus for a total of about 300 buses \nwill  reduce  approximately  20%  of  SO   and  SPM  emissions  from  buses.  Replacing  auto \n2\nrickshaws with CNG baby taxis and converting of 10,000 vehicles to CNG are expected to \nreduce emissions of HC, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), SO , and SPM. The results are improved air \n2\nquality and reduced threat to public health. Similar projects will subsequently be implemented in \nother major cities of Bangladesh to improve the environment.  \n                  \n2.  Impacts of the Establishment of Gas Transmission Pipelines \n \n9.  No significant impact is expected due to the location of the pipeline, since there is no \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area  along  the  alignment  of  the  transmission  line.  However, \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  stage  will  occur:  (i)  increased  air \npollution due to increasing dust, (ii) increased noise, (iii) disturbance of the surface water \nsystem due to cut and filling and other earthworks, and (iv) potentially more increase traffic \naccidents. The mitigation measures to minimize these impacts have already been detailed in the \nland acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP): (i) establish clear traffic signs to inform road \nusers about the construction works; (ii) maintain optimum moisture content during handling of \nsoil, spray water to minimize dust; (iii) strictly control the construction works that create noise by \nprohibiting night work in the residential areas; (iv) have provisions for pumping stagnant water; \nand (v) provide an adequate drainage system. These mitigation measures will be included in the \ncontract document for the contractor. Clearly, all these impacts are temporary and manageable. \nThe operation of the gas transmission pipeline will have no significant environmental impact. \nWhile the operation of city gate stations (CGS), particularly regulators to reduce gas pressures, \nwill create insignificant noise, ranging from 40 to 60 decibels, no mitigation measure is required. \nIf needed, an appropriate silencing mechanism will be built into the regulating streams of CGSs. \n          \n3.  Impacts  Due  to  the  Expansion  of  Gas  Distribution  Network  and  the \nEstablishment of CNG Filling Stations and Workshops \n \n10.  Traffic disturbance could be the main impact when the distribution pipes are laid. Other \nimpacts will be increased air pollution due to increasing dust during the construction stage, and \ndisruption of drainage and some parts of the water system. The proposed mitigation measures \nwill include rerouting traffic, providing clear information to road users about the construction \nworks, and similar measures for minimizing impacts from the laying of the gas transmission line. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \n11.  The operation of CNG filling stations, particularly with compressors to increase gas \npressure, will generate noise of about 30-50 decibels for about 5-8 hours per day. No mitigation \nmeasure is required.   \n           \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n1.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility  \n \n12.  The  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction stage. The construction supervisors from Gas Transmission Company Limited \n(GTCL), Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL), and Titas Gas Transmission and \nDistribution  Company  Limited  (TGTDCL)  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  contract \ndocumentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations \nof  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for \nnoncompliance.  The  three  companies  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  overall  mitigation \nmeasures and the monitoring plan, which includes collaboration with other agencies (e.g., office \nof  the  chief  inspector  of  explosives  for  approval  of  layout  and  materials  needed  for \nnondestructive testing of pipe welds; district and municipal traffic enforcer for rerouting traffic \nduring  the  construction  stage;  Bangladesh  Road  and  Transport  Agency  for  monitoring  the \nmovement  of  buses  and  auto  rickshaws  outside  Dhaka)  as  well  as  the  Department  of \nEnvironment for environmental management. \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n \n13.  The IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will be \npart of the mitigation of adverse impacts, which will be mostly the responsibility of GTCL, \nTGTDCL,  and  RPGCL.  The  DOE  will  carry  out  ambient  air  quality  monitoring,  while  the \nDepartment of Explosives will handle explosive materials. \n  \nF.  Finding and Recommendations \n \n14.  The IEE report shows that environmental impacts associated with the proposed Project \nare manageable and can be mitigated. The positive impact, particularly, improved air quality, will \nreduce  threats  to  the  public  health.  Environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  not  be  disrupted. \nTherefore, a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) to assess further impacts of the gas \ntransmission pipelines is not required. However, the Project is categorized as a red category \nproject in accordance with Bangladesh Environmental Preservation Rules 1997. Therefore, any \nworks for this Project can begin only after the DOE issues an environmental clearance.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n15.  The Project will improve air quality in Dhaka.  The overall IEE finding is that the Project \nwill  not  cause  a  significant  environmental  problem  and  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are \nmanageable.  However, continued monitoring should be carried out. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021105162449Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030117094716+08'00'"}}
