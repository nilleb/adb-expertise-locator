It includes \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  building  staff  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement  and  urban  service  provision,  as  well  as  enhancing \npublic awareness on public hygiene.    \n \nThimphu and Phuentsholing face the full force of urban migration \nand  urban  sprawl  generated  by  limited  job  opportunities  in  rural \nareas. The task of absorbing the 70,000 people expected to enter \nthe  labor  market  over  5  year  period  is  quite  challenging.  The \nunemployment  rate  countrywide  is  2\u20133%,  but  in  urban  areas  the \nrate  is  4.1%  and,  among  those  aged  15\u201319  years,  the  urban \nunemployment  figure  is  as  high  as  10.9%.  The  Government  is \nresponding  to  the  increase  in  urbanization  by  emphasizing  the \nimportance  of  securing  equality  in  living  standards  in  the  various \nparts  of  the  country  \u201cto  ensure  that  the  benefits  of  development \nare shared equitably between different income groups and regions \nand in ways that promote social harmony, stability, and unity and \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  a  just  and  compassionate \nsociety.\u201d With this requirement in mind, the Government asked for \ncontinued  Asian  Development  Bank \nin \nimproving  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing,  particularly  in  their  newly  expanded  areas.  It  also \nasked  for  support  in  developing  Dagana,  one  of  the  regional \ncenters unassisted by any other source of aid in the past.   \n \nThe primary impact of the Project is improved urban infrastructure \nand urban services management in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and \nDagana, which will contribute to augmenting the growth potential \nin  these  areas.  The  outcomes  of  the  Project  will  include  (i) \nimproving  urban  infrastructure  planning;  (ii)  constructing  urban \nroads,  drainage,  and  other  public  infrastructure;  (iii)  broadening \nwater  treatment,  supply,  and  sanitation  coverage;  (iv)  enhancing \ncommunity  awareness  on  proper  hygiene;  and  (v)  providing \ncapacity  building  in  urban  facility  management  to  staff  of  project \ncities and towns and the Executing Agency (EA), the Department \n\n(ADB)  assistance \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nof Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) of the \nMinistry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS).  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30.75  million \nequivalent,  including  taxes,  duties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB \nloan, and physical and price contingencies.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $24.6  million  equivalent  (SDR \n16,597,000), which is 80% of the total cost. The Government will \nfinance  $6.15  million  equivalent,  or  20%  of  the  total  project  cost, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement  cost,  land  acquisition, \nremuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  part  of \nthe civil works, and other miscellaneous costs. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $24.6  million  equivalent  (SDR  16,597,000)  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided in various currencies to \nfinance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  interest  charged  at  the \nrate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2012 \n \n30 June 2012 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nDUDES, MoWHS.  \n \nThe EA will establish a project management unit (PMU) located at \nDUDES premises and headed by the project manager. The PMU \nwill  be  the  key  organization  ensuring  overall  execution  and \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  the  Project,  as  well  as  for \ncost  and  quality  control.  Thimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC)  will  be \nthe  implementing  agency  (IA)  for  Component  A,  Phuentsholing \nCity Corporation (PCC) for Component B, Dagana Dzongkhag for \nComponent C, and DUDES for Components D and E. \n \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(April  2006).  All  civil  work  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of more than $1 million will be awarded by international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan  $1  million  will  be  carried  out  using  national  competitive \nits \nbidding  or  other  procedures  acceptable \nProcurement Guidelines. Procurement of goods will preferably be \ngrouped  into  packages  larger  than  $500,000  to  be  suitable  for \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Goods  that  cannot \nbe  grouped  into  larger  contracts  and  are  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan  $500,000  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  limited  international  bidding \nprocedures,  and  miscellaneous  minor  goods  expected  to  cost \n\nto  ADB  under \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nunder  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  purchased  using  shopping \nprocedures.  The  proposed  procurement  plan  is  in  Appendix  8. \nWhile procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under \nthe guidance of the PMU, equipment and vehicle rentals common \nto all project towns will be procured by the PMU. \n \nAll  consultants  under  the  Project  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006). While the \nproject  management  consultant  and  the  design,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision consultant will be recruited using the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method,  for  smaller  packages  and  specialized \nconsulting  services  under  Component  D  of \nthe  Project, \nconsultants may be selected and engaged using methods such as \nquality-based  selection,  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection, \nsingle  source  selection,  and  individual  consultant  selection.  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  (51  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  179  person-months  of  national)  will  be \nengaged  to  assist  the  PMU  in  overall  project  management  and \nimplementation.  Similarly,  one  international  consulting  firm  (49 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 68 person-\nmonths  of  national)  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PIUs  in  the \ndesign, monitoring, and supervision of contracts under the Project. \n \nThe  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  improved  health  and \ngeneral living standards for residents of Thimphu, Phuentsholing, \nand  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium  Development \nGoals;  (ii)  sustainable  and  reliable  urban  services  through  more \neffective  city  corporation  management;  and \nimproved \neconomic  and  social  conditions  in  the  three  project  areas  from \ninvestments  in  roads,  drainage,  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, and community facilities.  \n \nThe Project will provide improved water supply and sanitation and \nassociated  health  services  to  about  19,000  people  in  poor  areas \nselected low coverage and high prevalence of diarrhea and other \nsanitation-related illness. An estimated 55,000 people will directly \nbenefit from the urban infrastructure subcomponents. The Project \nwill also strengthen the capacity and capability of staff at TCC and \nPCC  to  upgrade  infrastructure  in  more  strategically  coherent \nmanner,  plan  budgets  for  continued  maintenance  and  repair \nneeds, and so reduce the frequency of unwarranted breakdowns. \nLocal private contractors, as well as suppliers, will benefit from the \nflow  of  more  than  $27  million  in  contracts  for  civil  works  and \nequipment over the 6 years of the Project.  \n \n\n(iii) \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nAs  the  scale  of  civil  works  under  the  Project  in  Thimphu  will  be \nlarge,  some  risks  arise  that  are  common  to  road,  water,  and \nwastewater  projects.  These  are  (i)  poor  detailed  design  of \nsubprojects,  (ii)  a  lack  of  experienced  contractors  available  for \nlarger  civil  work  contracts,  (iii)  poor  performance  by  appointed \ncontractors,  (iv)  poor  supervision  and  quality  control  of  works  by \nthe  IAs,  (v)  construction  material  not  being  readily  available,  and \n(vi) a lack of suitably trained operators for completed plants.   \n \nThe  other  risk  is  associated  with  the  land  pooling  (LP)  exercise. \nLP  requires  extensive  consultations  among  stakeholders  and  so \ntakes  considerable  time  to  reach  agreement.  While  assessments \nundertaken  during  project  preparation  show  that  the  impacts  on \nindividual  affected  people  or  households  are  not  expected  to  be \nsignificant, ensuring compliance with safeguards may take time. It \nwas noted during project preparation that time and resources are \nrequired  to  conduct  further  consultations,  particularly  with  non-\ntitled affected people, and ensure (i) compensation for any losses, \n(ii)  that  the  Government\u2019s  Office  of  Legal  Affairs  (OLA)  verifies \n100% of agreements, and (iii) adequate grievance redress. Delays \nin  compliance  with  safeguards,  particularly  the  provision  of \ncompensation, is a significant project risk. Moreover, the legal and \nadministrative system relating to urban infrastructure is at an early \nstage of development and does not provide a statutory framework \nfor LP.  Because Government-implemented LP schemes in other \nareas have been the subjects of two litigations, a legal opinion is \nbeing obtained from OLA to ensure the contractual validity of the \nproposed LP scheme. Furthermore, enabling provisions in relation \nin  Bhutan\u2019s  proposed  urban \nto  LP  are  being \ndevelopment/planning law, which will be presented to the National \nAssembly in late 2006. \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be \nprovided to support the IAs as they devise and carry out (i) a solid \nwaste  management  strategy  and  action  plan  for  Thimphu,  (ii)  a \ngeotechnical  and  slope  stability  study \n(iii) \nunaccounted-for water reduction and water calibration, and (iv) an \nLP  and  urban  facility  management  advisory.  The  estimated  total \ncost of TA is $312,500, of which ADB will finance $250,000 on a \ngrant  basis \nfunding  program.  The  TA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its \nBorrowers  and  will  engage  individual  international  consultants  (5 \nperson-months) and national consultants (16 person-months).  \n\nthe  ADB  TA \n\nin  Dagana; \n\nincluded \n\nfrom \n\n\f(cid:66) (cid:72) (cid:85) (cid:84) (cid:65)

 \n\n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Urban Infrastructure Development Project (the Project).1 This \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Urban \nInfrastructure  Planning  and  Management.  If  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting \nunder  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nPrior  to  the  early  1960s,  Bhutan  was  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  world  and  its  mainly \nrural population was almost entirely dependent on subsistence agriculture. Since embarking on \na modernization process in 1961, Bhutan has made great progress in improving the standard of \nliving of its people. The development strategy of the Government of Bhutan (the Government) \nhas  focused  on  striking  a  balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  growth  in  productivity  and \nincomes  and,  on  the  other  hand,  a  desire  to  preserve  its  cultural  and  environmental  heritage. \nSince  it  opened  to  the  outside  world,  Bhutan  has  embarked  on  a  far-reaching  development \nstrategy  that  has  brought  significant  improvement  in  the  economic  and  social  situation  of  the \ncountry. Real economic growth has averaged around 7% annually since the 1970s, raising the \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita from $51 in 1961, then the lowest in the world, to $870 \nin 2005. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  plan  set  out  in  Vision  20202 is  translated  into  sector \n3. \npolicies,  strategies,  and  programs  through  5-year  development  plans.  The  National  Poverty \nReduction Strategy, including the 9th Five Year Plan (FYP), has five overall goals: (i) improving \nthe  quality  of  life  and  income,  especially  of  the  poor;  (ii)  ensuring  good  governance;  (iii) \npromoting  private  sector  growth  and  employment  generation;  (iv)  preserving  and  promoting \ncultural  heritage  and  environment  conservation;  and  (v)  achieving  rapid  economic  growth  and \ntransformation.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  priorities  to  achieve  these  objectives  are  (i) \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  setting  sound  macroeconomic  policy,  (iii)  ensuring  good \nexpanding \ngovernance,  and  (iv)  improving  access  and  enhancing  social  services.  The  National  Poverty \nReduction Strategy accords high priority to infrastructure expansion, rural telecommunications, \nand  urban  infrastructure  development.  It  observes  that  expanding  the  road  network  and \nelectricity grid is an essential prerequisite for improving rural access and providing basic social \nservices such as health and education.  \n \n4. \nUrban settlement is a new phenomenon in Bhutan, with a quickening pace in the last 15 \nto 20 years that is already showing signs of putting pressure on urban areas. The beginning of \nurban settlement in Bhutan was the establishment of dzongkhag (district or provincial) centers, \ncurrently numbering 20. These centers began as administrative and religious entities rather than \ncommercial  and  industrial  ones.  According  to  the  Government\u2019s  first  comprehensive  census, \nwhose summary result was released on 27 April 2006, the national population is 672,425. The \nurban population currently stands at 31% of the total population. If rural-urban migration trends \n                                                 \n1   The Project was prepared through ADB project preparatory technical assistance BHU-4533 (ADB. 2004. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Urban  Municipal  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila;  \napproved on 23 December, for $600,000).   \n\n2   Planning  Commission,  1999.  Bhutan:  2020-A  Vision  for  Peace,  Prosperity  and  Happiness.  Royal  Government  of \n\nBhutan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n                         \n\ncontinue  at  their  current  pace,  close  to  half  of  the  country\u2019s  population  may  reside  in  urban \ncenters  by  2020.  Ensuring  that  urban  development  is  environmentally  sustainable  requires \nimprovements  in  municipal  planning  and  management  capacity  and  the  institutionalization  of \ncost-recovery practices for urban services. The urban sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nUrban Centers. In 1996, the Government classified the urban centers in five categories, \nfrom A to E sequentially, reflecting their population size and level of public infrastructure (e.g., \nschools, sports grounds, and hotels). In total, 28 urban centers have been designated following \nthis  definition  by  the  Planning  Commission,  comprising  20  dzongkhag  (district)  headquarters; \ntwo  dungkhags  (subdistricts);  Phuentsholing;  and  five  satellite  towns  (Bondey,  Gedu,  Khaling, \nRangjung, and Wamrong). \n \n6. \nUrban  Sector  Policies. The Government is responding to the increase in urbanization \nwith  a  number  of  policy  documents,  including  the  9th  FYP  and  Vision  2020,  which  focus  on \ndecentralization, social equity, and building the capacity of local authorities. The legal system in \nBhutan  was  originally  founded  on  rural  life  and  an  agricultural  economy.  In  recent  times,  the \nGovernment has taken steps to enact laws that will have wider implications for the development \nof urban areas and associated infrastructure. Consequently, the legal and regulatory framework \nis being attuned to accommodate  and facilitate urban life and infrastructure development. The \nLand Act of 1979 is the basic law dealing with land in Bhutan and covers all land holdings in the \ncountry.  Many  provisions  contained  in  this  act  are  becoming  outdated  and  do  not  effectively \ndeal with issues associated with the development of urban areas and urban infrastructure. The \nGovernment is in the process of proposing the Bhutan Urban Development Act. The draft act in \npreparation  covers  issues  dealing  with  planned  development  and  management  of  urban  land, \nalso  accounting  for  ownership  of  urban  land  and  property,  land  acquisition,  compensation  for \nland  and  other  assets  at  reasonable  market  rates,  land  disposal,  modes  of  developing  land \nincluding land pooling (LP), and other provisions required for planning, allocating and managing \nurban development. The proposed act also provides simpler and more efficient procedures for \nregistering land transfers and a grievance redress system.    \n \nRapid Urbanization in Thimphu and Phuentsholing. Various programs are already in \n7. \nplace to attract people to secondary centers and retain them there to prevent their migration to \nthe major urban centers. Population is not disaggregated by city and town, and numbers vary \nfrom source to source. Based on information shared by the Government\u2019s Ministry of Works and \nHuman Settlement (MoWHS), the preliminary results of the 2005 census, Thimphu\u2019s population \nis estimated at 79,000 and growing annually by around 7%, while Phuentsholing\u2019s is at 20,000 \nand growing at less than 3%. Thimphu is growing at more than double the national growth rate, \npredominantly  from  rural-urban  migration,  and  its  population  is  projected  to  reach  150,000  by \n2027. The two cities face the full force of urban migration and urban sprawl due to limited job \nopportunities  in  rural  areas.  The  task  of  absorbing  the  additional  70,000  people  expected  to \nenter  the  labor  market  during  the  period  covered  by  the  9th  FYP  (2002-2007)  is  challenging, \ngiven the low employment elasticity of the power sector, which is the largest industry in Bhutan. \nThe unemployment rate countrywide is 2\u20133%, but in urban areas it is 4.1% and, among those \naged 15 to 19 years, the urban unemployment figure is as high as 10.9%. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is included in Appendix 3. \n \nThimphu  Urban  Strategy  and  Structural  Plan.  The  capital  city  of  Thimphu  has  had \n8. \ntwo  major  planning  activities  in  the  past  that  form  basis  for  its  latest  expansion:  the  Thimphu \n\n\fUrban  Development  Strategy 3  and  the  Thimphu  Structural  Plan. 4  The  latter  resulted  from \nincreased  pressure  from  both  governments  and  major  landowners  in  the  peripheral  areas, \nleading  the  Government  to  depart  from  its  strategic  incremental  approach  and  undertake  a \ncomprehensive structural plan. The structural plan proposed full provision of infrastructure along \nthe entire north-south urban corridor prior to land release. However, the Government\u2019s ability to \nfund this from its own revenues is limited. The structural plan detailed appropriate amounts of \nland required to accommodate expected population and economic growth, allowing for influx to \nthe  city.  Its  project  boundary  was  the  urban  area  of  Thimphu,  including  the  outlying  areas.  It \nundertook  a  detailed  planning  exercise  and  delineated  major  roads,  transportation  routes, \nneighborhood service nodes, land-use zoning, housing and shelter systems, and infrastructure \nsystems for the entire urban area. Following recommendations from the structural plan, in 2001, \n10  neighboring  areas  around  old  Thimphu  were  incorporated  into  greater  Thimphu  City  and \nplaced under the management of the Thimphu City Corporation (TCC).  \n \n9. \nDevolution of Power and Public Services Responsibility. The Royal decree of 1995 \ngranted autonomous status to TCC. Subsequently, in December 2003, a charter was issued in \naccordance with the provisions of the Bhutan Municipal Act 1999 providing autonomy to TCC, \nso  that  it  could  effectively  and  equitably  provide  services  to  the  residents  of  the  Thimphu \nmunicipal area. The executive head of TCC is the thrompon (mayor), who is appointed by the \nGovernment for a duration of its discretion. In accordance with the provisions of the act and the \ncharter,  TCC  is  directed  by  a  municipal  committee  consisting  of  elected  and  nominated \nmembers. Its functions cover the following: (i) formulating policies and development priorities of \nTCC, (ii) establishing procedures and guidelines, (iii) adopting rules to enable TCC to carry out \nits functions, (iv) reviewing and approving TCC\u2019s annual budget, and (v) any other function that \nthe Government may assign to it. However, all decisions taken by the municipal committee must \nbe submitted to the Government for approval.  \n \n10. \nPhuentsholing  City  Corporation  (PCC).  From  a  small  hamlet  of  scattered  hutments, \nPhuentsholing  town  has  since  1950  seen  unprecedented  growth.  Today,  it  is  considered  the \ncommercial  capital  of  Bhutan.  PCC  came  into  being  in  1983,  though  the  charter  approving  its \nincorporation  has  yet  to  be  issued.  It  is  understood  that  a  proposal  for  issuing  the  charter  is \nbefore the Government and may be issued in 2006. Thus, as of today, PCC is not a separate \nentity  like  TCC,  but  can  be  considered  an  arm  of  the  Department  of  Urban  Development  and \nEngineering  Services  (DUDES).  For  administrative  and  operational  convenience, \nthe \nGovernment has appointed a thrompon for PCC. As with TCC, PCC has a municipal committee, \nwhich functions similarly, with decisions made by the municipal committee of PCC also requiring \nsubmission  to  the  Government  for  approval.  Although  the  Government  has  stipulated  the \ndecentralization of planning and service provision to municipalities, in reality, capacity remains \nconstrained, and these functions are retained by MoWHS.  \n \nInstitutional  and  Staff  Capacity.  Engineers  and  urban  planners  in  DUDES  have  had \n11. \nlimited  capacity-building  opportunities  through  external  assistance,  but  the  skills  base  and \nhuman resources in TCC and PCC are very constrained. In recent years, consultants have been \nrecruited  to  help  TCC  and  PCC  develop  much-needed  planning,  engineering  design,  and \nprocurement  expertise.  Against  future  needs  for  engineering  and  planning  works  foreseen  for \nurban  development,  there  is  great  concern  that  the  staff  of  DUDES,  TCC,  and  PCC  require \nsignificant strengthening of their capacity. \n\n                                                 \n3   Public  Works  Department,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  United  Nations  Centre  for  Human \n\nSettlements. 1999.

Thimphu. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n                         \n\nLimited  Local  Resource  Mobilization.  Currently,  the  two  city  corporations\u2019  revenue \n12. \nbases  are  not  strong.  According  to  the  Bhutan  Municipal  Act  (1999),  their  income  is  broadly \nsegregated  into  two  categories:  tax  revenue  and  non-tax  revenue.  Tax  revenue  consists  of \ntaxes on land, urban housing, under-developed land, property transfers, and entertainment. The \nGovernment determines the tax rates and manner of levying. Non-tax revenue consists of fees \nand charges such as for land development, sub-division, land demarcation, processing building \nplans,  land  registration,  site  plans,  vehicle  parking,  market  vending,  advertising,  water  and \nsewerage, etc., as well as fines and penalties. \n \n13. \nDagana  Revenue  Base  and  Limited  Staff  Capacity.  Dagana  town,  the  capital  of \nDagana  Dzongkhag,  is  headed  by  a  dzongda  (district  administrator),  who  is  appointed  by  the \nGovernment.  Dagana  is  located  in  the  geographical  corridor,  which  include  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing.  The  dzongkhag  administration  is  responsible  for  developing,  maintaining  and \noperating  public  infrastructure  and  services  in  its  jurisdiction.  With  regard  to  tax  revenues, \nDagana, like other dzonkhag capitals, still falls under the non-urban category, so its tax revenue \nis  very  limited.  Dagana  Dzongkhag  administration\u2019s  operational  expenses  depend  entirely  on \ncentral  Government  subsidy  at  present.  The  engineering  staff5 undertakes  all  work  for  the  11 \ngeogs (counties) and four towns in Dagana, but planning and design are undertaken by DUDES \nin Thimphu.  \n \nExternal  Assistance  in  Urban  Sector. In the last decade, ADB, Government of India, \n14. \nWorld  Bank,  and  Danida  have  been  the  key  players  providing  external  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  for  developing  its  urban  sector.  While  India  has  been  a  key  donor  for  large \ninfrastructure  projects  such  as  roads  and  bridges,  Danida  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s \nprovision  of  urban  infrastructure  such  as  water  and  waste  treatment  plants  in  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing, a landfill site in Phuentsholing, and pilot housing through various projects. The \nmost recent Danida-supported project is for environment and urban sector program support and \nincludes  capacity  building  and  institutional  support  for  the  sector,  such  as  capacity  building  of \nthe local bodies and strengthening environmental  management. Danida is currently shifting its \nfocus from major urban centers to five provincial towns. The World Bank has provided various \nsmall-scale  infrastructure  and  capacity-building  projects,  including  utility  billing  and  account \nmanagement,  in  10  dzongkhag  towns  through  its  Bhutan  Urban  Development  Project  1.  The \nGovernment  is  currently  requesting  the  World  Bank  to  expand  its  assistance  to  two  or  three \nadditional dzongkhag towns and Thimphu. Based on an agreement with the Government, ADB \ncontinues  to  assist  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing  and  is  also  taking  up  one  of  the  remaining \ndzongkhag  towns,  namely  Dagana.  As  there  is  a  great  need  for  infrastructure  development  in \nthe newly extended areas of Thimphu, the Government, ADB, and World Bank have agreed to \nsplit  assistance  in  local  area  development  geographically,  with  ADB  taking  southern  Thimphu \nand  the  World  Bank  taking  northern  areas  (Appendix  4).  Since  ADB\u2019s  lending  operations  in \nBhutan began in 1983, it has funded 19 projects with a cumulative value of $111.2 million and \n90  technical  assistance  activities.  The  overarching  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  development  assistance  to \nBhutan,  as  articulated  in  its  country  strategy  and  program6 (2006\u20132010),  is  poverty  reduction \nthrough  economic  diversification,  and  its  development  strategies  for  achieving  this  goal  focus \nmainly  on  helping  the  Government  reduce  poverty  through  rural  electrification,  road  network \nexpansion, infrastructure improvements in regional centers, and basic skills development.     \n\n                                                 \n5   For urban development and municipal services, the dzongkhag administration has a district engineer supported by \nan  assistant  engineer,  5  junior  engineers,  and  12  support  staff.

The  outcomes  of  the  Project  will  include  (i)  improving  urban \ninfrastructure  planning;  (ii)  constructing  urban  roads,  drainage,  and  other  urban  facilities;  (iii) \nbroadening  water  treatment,  supply,  and  sanitation  coverage;  (iv)  enhancing  community \nawareness of proper hygiene; and (v) providing capacity building in urban facility management \nto staff of project municipalities and MoWHS.    \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe Project will have five components. Component A: Thimphu Urban Improvement will \ninclude  (i)  city-level  works  consisting  of  water  supply  source  augmentation,  treatment,  and \ndistribution;  upgrading  of  the  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant;  and  providing  solid  waste \nmanagement infrastructure and equipment; and (ii) local urban infrastructure provision in four of \nthe five new local areas of southern Thimphu currently being developed by TCC. Component B: \nPhuentsholing  Urban  Improvement  will  include  (i)  roads  and  drainage,  (ii)  footpaths  and  a \npedestrian  bridge,  and  (iii)  social  infrastructure  such  as  fire  hydrants  and  street  lighting. \nComponent  C:  Dagana  Urban  Improvement  will  include  (i) water  supply  source  augmentation, \ntreatment and distribution system improvement; (ii) sanitation improvement; and (iii) roads and \ndrainage provision. Component D: Technical Support will include (i) capacity building in DUDES \nand the implementing agencies, and (ii) public awareness enhancement. Component E: Project \nImplementation  Support  will  include  consulting  services  for  (i)  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU), and (ii) to support project implementation unit (PIU) design, monitoring, and supervision.   \n \n \n \n\nComponent A: Thimphu Southern and City-level Improvement  \n\n1.  \n\na.  City-Level Water Supply Augmentation and Distribution \n\n \n17.    To meet projected water demand in the southern areas of Thimphu, a new water supply \nsystem will be developed. This new South Thimphu water supply system will serve the areas on \nthe eastern left bank of the Wang Chhu, extending from Changjiji in the north to Serbithang in \nthe  south.  To  design  an  appropriate  and  least-cost  water  supply  system  that  would  ensure \ndistribution to all project areas by gravity and so minimize resource requirements\u2014both financial \ncosts  and  human  resources  for  O&M\u2014project  preparatory  technical  assistance  assessed \nvarious options for siting the water intake and treatment plant, such as at Ola Rongchu, Ngabi \nRongchu,  or  Megoipang,  as  well  as  treatment  methods.  Based  on  these  assessments,  the \noption  of  constructing  a  water  intake  and  treatment  plant  that  uses  a  simple  sand  filtration \nprocess in the Megoipang valley was adopted for the Project. The subcomponents will therefore \ninclude (i) constructing at Megoipang an intake and water treatment plant (WTP) with a capacity \nof 6,000 cubic meters (m3)/day; (ii) installing 19 kilometers (km) of water supply mains and an \nassociated  distribution  network;  (iii)  constructing  break-pressure  and  storage  tanks;  (iv) \nimproving 5 km of access road to the WTP; (v) purchasing and installing five bulk meters; and \n(vi)  helping  TCC  develop  guidelines  and  standard  operating  procedures  for  water  services, \nincluding,  among  other  things,  how  households  will  connect.  The  intake  and  WTP  site  will \noccupy  approximately  1  hectare  of  land  and  include  the  plant,  workshop,  and  administrative \nbuildings; living quarters for operations staff; and tanks for water storage and clearing. The WTP \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n                         \n\nwill consist of simple sedimentation and filtration units, to minimize operation and maintenance \n(O&M) and human resource costs, and use chlorine to disinfect. \n \n\nb. \n\nCity-Level Waste Water Treatment Plant Upgrade  \n\n \n18.  With the increase in population and water supply, the capacity of the existing wastewater \ntreatment  plant  (WWTP)  in  Babesa,  currently  estimated  at  1,750m3/day,  will  need  upgrading. \nThe Project will install mechanical aerators in the existing facultative ponds to increase WWTP \ncapacity  to  5,250m3/day.  The  WWTP  has  adequate  adjacent  land  on  which  to  further  expand \ncapacity  to  meet  projected  requirements  for  the  next  20  years.  The  Project  will  install  a  flow \nmeter at the WWTP. \n \n\nc. \n\nCity-Level Solid Waste Management  \n\n \n19. \nTo help TCC minimize and manage its growing municipal solid waste burden, a project \nsubcomponent  will  include  (i)  rehabilitating  the  existing  landfill  site  in  Mimilakha  and  providing \nlandfill site machinery (e.g., a compactor), to increase capacity and potentially cover the next 5 \nyears of municipal waste generation; (ii) providing an electrical substation, upgrading the access \nroad,  and  fencing  the  perimeter  to  make  operational  the  existing  Serbithang  Pilot  Composting \nPlant; (iii) constructing a sorting and recycling center to enable waste separation and recycling;7 \nand (iv) purchasing waste collection equipment to allow the separation of waste at source and \nminimize the need for waste disposal at the landfill. The detailed design of the physical works \nand procurement of equipment will only be carried out pursuant to the completion of the Solid \nWaste  Management  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  Thimphu  covered  under  a  piggy-backed \nadvisory  TA  (see para. 47).  Works under  this  subcomponent  will  be carried  out in conjunction \nwith  a  public  awareness  campaign  covered  under  Component  D  (para.  25).  Pursuant  to  the \ncompletion of a solid waste management (SWM) strategy  and action plan acceptable to ADB, \nand  discussions  at  the midterm  review,  the  Project  may  include  necessary  preparatory  works, \nincluding surveys for the future landfill site for Thimphu. \n \n\nLocal Area Infrastructure Development in South Thimphu \n\nd. \n  \n\nOut  of  10  new  local  areas  currently  being  developed  by  TCC,  the  Project  will  develop \n20. \nunder this subcomponent infrastructure in four local areas (Lungtenpu, Babesa, Simtokha and \nChangbandu) 8 located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Tashi  Chhodzong\u2013Babesa  Expressway.  The \nsubcomponent will include (i) approximately 20 km of secondary and tertiary roads, as well as \nassociated drainage, to connect the four local areas to major service roads and the expressway; \n(ii)  a  network  of  approximately  30  km  of  secondary  and  tertiary  water  distribution  pipes;  (iii)  a \nsewerage  collection  network  of  approximately  16.5  km,  including  300  manhole  chambers  and \nassociated structures; and (iv) the provision of approximately 14.6 km of ducting for power and \ntelecommunication networks, 650 meters of service pits, and associated structures.  \n \n\nComponent B: Phuentsholing Urban Improvement  \n\n2.  \n \nThe  component  will  include  (i)  improvements  to  2.8  km  of  the  road  network;  (ii) \n21. \nimprovements  to  road  junctions;  (iii)  developing  four  parking  lots  and  1.2  km  of  footpaths;  (iv) \nconstructing one pedestrian bridge over the Om (Dhoti) River; (v) providing approximately 100 \n\n                                                 \n7   The subcomponent will include facilitating the involvement of households and communities in waste separation and \n\nrecycling through public awareness programs developed through the piggy-backed TA (para. 47).  \n\n8   Listing of local areas is in the order of development stage; Luntenphu is most advanced in reaching landlords\u2019 land \n\npooling agreement. \n\n\fstreet  lights;  (vi)  purchasing  and  installing  five  hydrants;  and  (viii)  developing  social \ninfrastructure consisting of a mini public stadium, a central public square (Upper Market Precinct \nImprovement), and river bank improvements. \n \n \n \n\nComponent C: Dagana Urban Improvement \n\n3.  \n\na. \n\nWater Supply  \n\n \n Various  options  were  assessed  while  designing  an  appropriate  and  least-cost  water \n22. \nsupply  system  to  ensure  distribution  to  all  Project  areas  by  gravity  and  minimize  resource \nrequirements  for  O&M.  Based  on  these  assessments,  the  construction  of  two  new  intakes, \nrehabilitation of the existing intake, and construction of a WTP using simple sand filtration units \nat the existing site (using the existing break-pressure tank) was adopted. The subcomponents \nwill  therefore  include  (i)  developing  two  new  intakes  and  rehabilitating  the  existing  intake;  (ii) \nconstructing  a  WTP  of  300  m3/day  capacity  consisting  of  simple  sand  filtration  units,  with \nchlorine disinfection and storage tanks located in an area of 0.5 hectares; (iii) installing 8 km of \nwater  mains  supplied  by  gravity  to  all  areas  of  the  town;  and  (iv)  constructing  two  break-\npressure  tanks.  The  installation  of  secondary  and  tertiary  distribution  networks,  approximately \n200 household water supply connections,9 and subcomponents B and C below, will be carried \nout pursuant to the completion and acceptance by ADB of the Dagana Geotechnical and Slope \nStability Study, to be carried out under the piggy-backed advisory TA (para. 47). For secondary \nreticulation of the water supply, 1.2 km of the 50 millimeter supply pipelines recently installed by \nDagana Dzongkhag will be reused. \n\n \nb. \n\nRoads and Drainage \n\n \n23. \nThe subcomponent will provide improvements and extension to 1.1 km of main roads in \nthe  new  high  street  development  area  and  the  road  leading  to  the  National  Housing \nDevelopment Corporation colony, as well as associated roadside drainage.  \n \n\nc. \n\nSanitation \n\n \nThe  subcomponent  will  include  (i)  installing  a  collection  network  for  overflow  from \n24. \nhousehold  septic  tanks  in  the  densely  populated  high  street  development  area,  as  well  as \nconstructing a simple sewage-stabilization pond on 1 hectare of land, and (ii) providing a septic \ndesludging machine. \n\n \n4.  \n\nComponent D: Technical Support \n\n \n25. \nThe subcomponent will include technical support by providing (i) consulting services and \nprocuring equipment required for the following: (a) capacity building of DUDES, TCC, PCC and \nDagana Dzongkhag; (b) public awareness support in Thimphu to improve community health and \nsanitation  and  promote  civic  responsibility; 10  and  (ii)  training  courses  for  professional, \noperational,  and  technical  staff  of  DUDES,  TCC,  PCC,  and  Dagana  Dzongkhag  through \nmedium- and long-term training courses. This will assist staff members of DUDES, PCC, TCC, \nand  Dagana  Dzongkhag  enhance  their  managerial  and  operational  capacity  for  the  proper \nplanning, operation, and maintenance of urban services.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9 The Project will provide connection to the meter point.  \n10 This will include public awareness support to educate waste generator, and health impacts on waste handlers.  \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n                         \n\n5.  \n\nComponent E: Project Implementation Support  \n\nSpecial Features \n\ntendering,  evaluation,  execution,  and  management; \n\n \n26. \nThe  subcomponent  will  include  consulting  services  for  the  PMU  and  to  support  PIU \ndesign,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  It  will  help  the  PMU  and  PIUs  design,  implement  and \nsupervise the various interventions under the Project. Consulting support will include (i) project \nmanagement and monitoring; (ii) the detailed design of subcomponents; (iii) contract document \npreparation  and  structuring, \n(iv) \nconstruction supervision; and (v) the preparation and execution of capacity-building programs. \n \nC.  \n \n27. \nPublic  Awareness  Support.  The  Project  will  improve  community  awareness  and \npromote civic responsibility. For example, the solid waste management subcomponent will, with \neffective  awareness-raising  activities,  contribute  to  solving  the  problem  through  better  waste \nsegregation  at  source  and  a  reduction  of  non-biodegradable  items,  such  as  plastic  bottles,  to \nenable  management  measures  such  as  recycling  and  composting  of  biodegradable  items  to \nbecome cost effective. It will also support raising public awareness of the need for cost recovery \nin  urban  services,  i.e.  the  need  for  tariff  collection  as  well  as  promote  general  hygiene, \nsanitation, water conservation, and traffic management. Experts will be engaged to review the \ncurrent household- and city-level practices and recommend changes to improve services. \n \n28. \nLand  Pooling  (LP)  Process.  In  Thimphu\u2019s  local  areas,  almost  every  plot  is  irregularly \nshaped and is landlocked without any infrastructure facilities, which leaves very limited options \nfor  urban  development.  One  option  is  to  develop  only  those  land  parcels  where  services  and \namenities  can  be  easily  fitted  through  guided  land  development,  but  this  would  incur  uneven \ndevelopment skewed by the original agricultural layout and further fragment urban land. Where \nfield  boundaries  are  irregular,  road  alignments  tend  to  remain  irregular  and  lack  proper \ngeometry or allotment. Infrastructure servicing can be inefficient and expensive, as agricultural \nneeds  have  very  little  in  common  with  those  of  modern  services  (e.g.,  drinking  water),  and \naccommodating proper drainage in narrow lanes is difficult. The other option is site-and-services \nprovision through land acquisition, to be developed by public authorities or through private real \nestate  agencies.  TCC  or  private  developers  would  acquire  the  whole  local  area  for  planned \ndevelopment, but this would not necessarily benefit many original landowners; as in many other \ncountries, real estate companies usually buy land cheaply from owners and later sell at a much \nhigher  price  to  well-off  households.  In  addition,  there  is  no  private  real  estate  developer  in \nBhutan to take all the financial risks of such a large investment or commit to providing sufficient \nurban services, nor does TCC have the required resources. LP has been appraised as the most \nappropriate tool for local area planning in Thimphu in the 10 newly incorporated areas. LP is a \ntechnique used to redefine ownership of land in a way that creates a new configuration of plots \nmore appropriate for urban structures and uses. Urban land development is realized through the \ncontribution of  a  certain portion  of  land  from  each  owner,  proportionate to  his  or  her  holdings, \nwhich  produces  sufficient  land  for  the  provision  of  public  roads,  public  infrastructure,  social \nfacilities,  and  open  space.  The  LP  plan  will  include  safeguards  and,  to  further  ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB  safeguards  policies,  the  following  needs  are  addressed:  (i)  ensuring \nconsultation  with  non-titled  affected  persons  (APs),  (ii)  identifying  impacts  on  all  affected \npersons  (APs)  and  ensuring  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  vulnerable  and  non-titled \nAPs, (iii) agreement from 100% of landowners verified by the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) as a \nthird  party, 11 and  (iv)  improving  mechanisms  for  grievance  redress.  In  these  areas,  further \n\n                                                 \n11  Another  third  party  will  be  identified  and  included  as  witness  on  the  side  of  the  landowner  in  line  with  a  legal \n\nopinion from OLA (19 July 2006). \n\n\fconsultations  were  conducted,  particularly  with  non-titled  APs;  the  summary  resettlement \nframework  was  disclosed  and  explained  to  APs  particularly  regarding  entitlements  and  the \nstrengthened grievance redress mechanism.12  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30.75  million  equivalent,  including  taxes, \nduties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with interest charged at the rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will cover 80% of the total project cost. \nInterest during the project implementation period will be capitalized. The remaining $6.15 million \nequivalent (20% of the total project cost) will be provided by the Government to finance taxes \nand duties, resettlement cost, land acquisition, and part of the civil works. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n\n                                                 \n12  Attached  as  Appendix  11  is  the  Draft  Summary  Resettlement  Framework  for  LP  related  works  of  Component  A, \n\nwhich sets out the basis, structure, and detailed process proposed for LP in this case. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n                         \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \nTotal \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nTotal Cost \n\n24.60 \n6.15 \n30.75 \n\nPercent \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\nF. \n \n\n                  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n31. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be DUDES. The EA will establish a PMU \nlocated  at  DUDES  premises  and  headed  by  the  project  manager.  The  PMU,  supported  by  a \nteam  of  project  management  consultants  (PMC),  will  be  the  key  organization  for  ensuring  the \noverall execution and implementation of the Project. The PMU will be responsible for planning, \nmonitoring, and reporting on the Project, as well as for cost and quality control. It will  (i) serve \nas the secretariat for the project steering committee (PSC); (ii) undertake project management, \nadministration, and interagency coordination at the executive level; (iii) supervise and guide the \nPIUs; (iv) maintain project accounts; (v) oversee procurement procedures to ensure compliance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures;  (vi)  liaise  with  ADB  for  quarterly \nproject progress updates and other reporting and communication matters; and (vii) prepare the \nproject completion report to the Government and ADB. The EA will ensure that, throughout the \nproject  implementation  period,  adequate  allocations  of  counterpart  funds  are  made,  approved, \nand released in a timely manner to ensure proper project implementation. The EA will provide \nadequate  office  space  for  the  Project  and  ensure  that  the  facilities  provided  under  the  Project \nare operated and maintained appropriately.  \n \n32. \nTCC  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  for  Component  A,  PCC  for  Component  B, \nDagana Dzongkhag for Component C, and DUDES for Components D and E. Three PIUs will \nbe established within TCC, PCC and Dagana dzongkhag administration, supported by sufficient \nprofessional  staff  dedicated  to  the  Project  and  by  design,  monitoring,  and  supervision  (DMS) \nconsultants.  \n \n33. \nA  central  PSC  will  be  set  up  under  the  chairmanship  of  MoWHS  Secretary  to  facilitate \nand  ensure  adequate  coordination  among  various  ministries, 13  the  EA,  IAs,  and  relevant \nstakeholders, and provide guidance to the PMU and PIUs. In particular, the PSC will (i) meet at \nleast  quarterly  or  more  frequently  if  required,  (ii)  provide  guidance  for  and  ensure  the \nimplementation  of  Government  and  ADB  policies  for  the  Project,  (iii)  assist  in  resolving  any \ninteragency implementation problems, (iv) review relevant reports and audit statements from the \nPMU and PIUs as and when required, and (v) ensure that conditions of the Project agreements \nwith  ADB  are  met.

The \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n36. \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). All contracts for works estimated \nto  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $1  million  will  be  awarded  by  international  competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1  million  will  be  carried  out \nusing  national  competitive  bidding  or  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  under  its \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  procurement  of  goods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages \nlarger than $500,000 to be suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods that \ncannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 will follow \nADB\u2019s  limited  international  bidding  procedures,  and  miscellaneous  minor  goods  expected  to \ncost  under  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.  The  proposed \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8.  \n \n37.  While  procurement  will generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  under the  guidance  of  the \nPMU, equipment and vehicle rentals common to all project areas will be procured by the PMU.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n38. \nAll consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers  (April  2006). \nWhile the PMC and DMS consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection, \nfor  smaller  packages  and  specialized  consulting  services  under  Component  D  of  the  Project, \nconsultants  may  be  selected  and  engaged  using  methods  such  as  consultants\u2019  qualifications \nselection, quality-based selection, single source selection, or individual consultants selection as \nreflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  An  international  consulting  firm  (51  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 179 person-months of national) will be engaged as PMC to \nassist  the  PMU  in  overall  project  management  and  implementation.  Similarly,  an  international \nconsulting firm (49 person-months of international consulting services and 68 person-months of \nnational) will be engaged as DMS consultant to assist the PIUs in the design, monitoring, and \nsupervision of contracts under the Project.14  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 Outline terms of reference for consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n                         \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n \n39. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  DUDES.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA,  IAs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project.15 \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  (i)  submission  of  general  procurement  notice  to  ADB  for \n40. \npublication  in  accordance  with  the  Procurement  Guidelines  and  (ii),  upon  receiving  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno \nobjection\u201d  to  the  recommendation  of  the  contract  award,  shall  publish  in  daily  newspapers \ncirculated nationally, both in English and the local language, the results identifying the bid and \nlot numbers, and also (a) the name of each bidder, (b) bid prices as read out at bid opening, (c) \nname  and  evaluated  prices  of  each  bid  that  was  evaluated,  (d)  names  of  bidders  whose  bids \nwere rejected and the reasons for their rejection, and (e) the name of the winning bidder and the \nprice it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded. In addition \nto  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  the \nGovernment will create a webpage in the existing DUDES website, and public disclosure board \noutside  the  project  office,  disclosing  information  on  various  matters  regarding  the  Project, \nincluding procurements related to it.   \n \n41. \nchecks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the Project. \n\nThe Government will allow and assist ADB's representatives\u2019 carrying out random spot \n\n \n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n42.  Withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001), as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between \nADB and the Government. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and efficient project \nimplementation,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  of \nBhutan  for  the  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt  Management  (DADM)  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  DADM  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  imprest \naccount and ensuring the timely release of funds. Statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures \nmay  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  to  the  imprest \naccount for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. The advance to \nthe imprest account will be limited to expected projected disbursement for the next 6 months or \n10%  of  the  loan,  whichever  is  lower.  Auditors  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the \nimprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount and SOE procedures will be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n43. \nThe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made on the Project, including all goods, works, \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB is discussing with the Government an anticorruption act. ADB is requested to provide an informal review on \n\nthe draft act, particularly the penal and criminal sections.  \n\n\fand services financed by the loan proceeds and Government funds. The project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  submit annual  audited  reports \nand  related  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year. 16 \nDUDES  was  made  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  delayed  submission  and  also  of  the  importance \nthat the quality of audited reports be acceptable.  \n \n44. \nThe PMU will prepare brief monthly progress reports in a format acceptable to ADB with \ninformation on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-identified monitoring \nindicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  them;  (iii)  work \ncarried out by consultants; (iv) updated results of water-quality monitoring and action taken on \nproblems encountered; (v) changes in project staff; (vi) compliance with loan covenants; (vii) a \nproposed program of activities for the next month; and (viii) progress expected during the next 3 \nmonths. The monthly report will be submitted to ADB by the end of first week of the following \nmonth. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMU will prepare and submit \nto  ADB  a  project  completion  report  on  the  execution  of  the  Project,  including  costs  and \ncompliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  list  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMC  in  accordance \n45. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS).  The  system  will  establish  a \ncause-and-effect relationship between the Project and its impact. The PPMS will comprise (i) a \ncomprehensive list of implementation-related performance indicators duly collected, monitored, \nand  recorded  by  the  PMU  and  PIUs  and  semiannually  assessed  by  MoWHS  and  (ii)  post-\ncompletion performance and impact data collected by the PMU. Baseline and impact data will \nbe  disaggregated  by  city,  town,  and  local  area  and  by  other  dimensions  to  be  discussed  at \nproject  inception.  Implementation  of  performance  monitoring  will  integrate  financial  and  other \naspects. The PMC, through the PMU, will establish the PPMS satisfactory to ADB within 1 year \nof the loan effective date.   \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  jointly  by  the  EA,  IAs,  and  ADB  semiannually  to  assess \nimplementation  progress.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  by  the  EA,  IAs \nand  ADB  3  years  after  commencement  of  the  Project.  Taking  into  account  the  PPMS  results, \nthe  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  and  evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity  of  the  IAs;  (iii)  identify  changes  needed  in  any  of  the  areas  mentioned  above;  (iv) \nassess  the  implementation  performance  against  agreed  project  indicators  and  targets;  (v) \nreview  and  establish  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify  critical  issues, \nproblems, and constraints, if any, and, if necessary, recommend adjustments in project design \nor implementation arrangements. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  The  Royal  Audit  Authority  is  being  supported  by  ADB  technical  assistance  on  introducing  financial  and \n\nperformance audits. \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n                         \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n47. \nTA of $250,000 for Capacity Building in Urban Infrastructure Planning and Management \n(Appendix 9) will be provided17 to enhance the capacity of staff at TCC, PCC, and Dagana, as \nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  performance  evaluation  found  in  May  2005  that  the  successful \nimplementation  of  civil  works  should  be  supported  by  long-term  sector  involvement  combined \nwith  capacity-building  programs  and  investment  support.  To  this  end,  TA  will  consist  of  the \nfollowing four components: (i) a solid waste management strategy and action plan for Thimphu, \n(ii) a Dagana geotechnical and slope stability study, (iii) unaccounted-for water (UFW) reduction \nand water calibration for Thimphu and Phuentsholing, and (iv) assistance on LP and managing \nurban  facilities.  The  first  component  will  develop  a  comprehensive  plan,  identifying  concrete \nshort-,  medium-,  and  long-term  measures  to  minimize  and  manage  solid  waste  in  Thimphu. \nWhile the short-term measures may include rehabilitation of the existing landfill site, medium- to \nlong-term  measures  will  include  identifying  a  future  site  for  a  landfill  and  recycling  center  for \nThimphu and improving waste segregation at source and waste collection. This component will \nalso  look  at  the  potential  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  solid  waste  management, \nincluding  composting  operations.  The  second  component,  the  Dagana geotechnical  and slope \nstability  study,  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  the  project  area\u2019s  long-term  geotechnical  stability \nand minimize potential risks to residents and infrastructure, especially assessing the area\u2019s soil \nconditions and landslide risk for its inhabitants. Current financial records of TCC and PCC show \nthat both city corporations\u2019 water supply operations are self-sustaining to the extent that general \nmaintenance costs are recovered but are unable to cover needed repair and expansion of water \ncoverage.  Therefore,  the  third  component  will  include  (i)  developing  an  understanding  and \nprocedures  within  PCC  and  TCC  for  identifying  UFW  and  (ii)  implementing  a  UFW-reduction \nprogram, including documents for a performance-based bid invitation. The fourth component will \nprovide  advisory  review  for  smoother  LP  implementation  and  urban  facility  management.18 TA \nwill be financed as a grant from the ADB TA funding program and be carried out by individual \nconsultants  to  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nInternational  inputs  of  about  5  months  and  national  consultant  inputs  of  about  16  months  are \nrequired.   \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Project Benefits and Impacts \n\nA.  \n \n48. \nThe main benefits of the Project will be (i) improved health and general living standards \nfor  residents  of  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals;  (ii)  sustained  and  reliable  urban  services  through  more  effective  city \ncorporation management; and (iii) improved economic and social conditions in the three towns \narising  from  investments  in  roads,  drainage,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and other community facilities. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  and  associated \nhealth  services  to  about  19,000  people  in  poor  areas  selected  for  low  coverage  and  high \nincidence  of  diarrhea  and  other  sanitation-related  illness.  An  estimated  55,000  people  will \ndirectly  benefit  from  the  urban  infrastructure  subcomponents.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen \n                                                 \n17  The attached TA will also seek an additional $50,000 from the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector for top-up \n\nsupport.   \n\n18  This should not duplicate with other TAs provided under ADB Road Network project or City Development Strategy  \nassistance  under  the  Cities  Alliance  (World  Bank  and  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  as  co-sponsors),  \n2006.  \n\n\fthe capacity and capability of staff in two city corporations, TCC and PCC, such that they will be \nbetter  able  to  upgrade  infrastructure  in  a  more  coherently  strategic  manner,  plan  budgets  for \ncontinued  maintenance  and  repair  needs,  and  so  reduce  the  frequency  of  unwarranted \nbreakdowns. In addition, predominantly local private contractors and their workers and suppliers \nwill benefit from the flow of more than $27 million in contracts for civil works and equipment over \nthe 6 years of the Project.19       \n \nB.  \n \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n50. \nThe  EA  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  following  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  IEE \n(Supplementary Appendix D) shows that the Project will result in substantial net environmental \nand  public  health  benefits.  These  include  (i)  better  public  health  from  improved  water  supply, \ndrainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (ii)  reduced  downstream  pollution  and  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases  from  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment;  (iii)  reduced  air \npollution  from  road  and  junction  improvements;  and  (iv)  improved  quality  of  life  from  urban \namenities.  Consultations  and  meetings  with  stakeholders  were  undertaken  during  IEE \npreparation to provide general and environment-related information and to obtain feedback on \nproject-related  issues  of  public  concern.  The  salient  points  of  the  IEE  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n51.  \nThe  selection  of  project  components  focused  on  considering  the  most  severe \nenvironmental risks, alleviating waste accumulation problems, and using appropriate and readily \nadopted  technology.  The  Project  will  not  generate  any  significant  negative  environmental \nimpacts.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts,  mostly  associated  with  construction,  are \ntemporary  and \nfor \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  (ii)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  identifying \nmonitoring  parameters  and  responsible  agencies  to  ensure  that  mitigation  measures  are \nproperly  undertaken  and  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  are  addressed.  The  IEE \nconcludes that no further assessment on environmental impacts is required beyond issues to be \nreviewed during detailed design. \n \n\nIEE  contains  (i)  environmental  management  plans \n\nlocalized.  The \n\n2. \n\nSocial \n\n \nResettlement. The EA prepared draft resettlement plans for Component A (Thimphu), B \n52. \n(Phuentsholing),  and  C  (Dagana)  following  the  Government\u2019s  Land  Act  of  1979  (amended  in \n1991)  and  Land  Compensation  Rate  (1996)  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995).20 The Project minimizes land acquisition and resettlement. In Thimphu, there will be no \nland  acquisition,  but  required  land  will  be  obtained  through  LP.  An  estimated  497  seasonal \nworkers and 173 leaseholders will be affected. The impacts on these affected persons (APs) are \nnot  anticipated  to  be  substantial  as  the  affected  sources  of  income  are  not  significant.  The \nsocioeconomic survey of APs shows that the average seasonal worker is employed for only 9 or \n10 days a year. An assessment of the Project\u2019s involuntary resettlement impacts will be finalized \nduring  detailed  design,  and  an  updated  resettlement  plan  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by \nADB  prior  to  the  award  of  contracts  for  works.  To  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \n\n                                                 \n19 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 3.    \n20  Supplementary Appendixes F, G, and H.  \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n                         \n\nrequirements  on  voluntary  donation,21 a  resettlement  framework22 to  guide  the  implementation \nof the LP scheme has been formulated by the EA. A summary of the resettlement framework is \nin Appendix 11. \n \nIn  Phuentsholing,  the  selection  criteria  of  project  components  included  resettlement \n53. \nimpacts. To the extent possible, priority was given to components involving rehabilitation on the \npremises of existing urban infrastructure and construction of new facilities on Government land. \nResettlement  impacts  will  be  further  minimized  through  careful  siting  and  alignment  during \ndetailed  design.  There  will  be  no  land  acquisition  in  Phuentsholing,  but  the  Project  will  have \nimpact  on  four  residential  and  one  commercial  structure  owned  by  the  Government,  and  on  a \nGovernment plot leased for use as a scrap yard. New residential quarters will be provided to the \nfour  affected  households,  who  are  employees  of  the  Royal  Bhutan  Army,  and  impacts  on \nleaseholders  and  their  10  employees  are  addressed  in  the  resettlement  plan,  which  is \nsummarized in Appendix 12. \n \n54. \nPermanent  acquisition  of  1.1  hectares  of  land  is  required  in  Dagana  for  water  and \nwastewater  treatment,  which  will  affect  two  households.  Impacts  are  not  anticipated  to  be \nsignificant,  as  land  to  be  acquired  is  vacant  and  not  used  for  productive  purposes.  The \nresettlement plan is summarized in Appendix 13. \n \nIndigenous  People.  The  Project  provides  social  benefits  through  improved  and \n55. \nexpanded water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage, solid waste management, and community \nfacilities  resulting  in  significant  environmental  and  public  health  benefits  in  the  project  areas. \nSocial  assessments  undertaken  during  project  preparation  do  not  indicate  significant  adverse \nimpacts  on  vulnerable  groups  and  did  not  identify  any  indigenous  peoples,  as  the  urban \npopulation  of  the  project  areas  are  fully  mainstreamed.  The  resettlement  plan  provides \nadditional compensation to vulnerable groups including indigenous peoples, if any are found to \nbe affected during detailed design. \n \n56. \nGender.  The  Project  will  have  no  negative  gender  impacts.  Significant  environmental \nand  public  health  benefits  from  the  Project  will  accrue  to  both  women  and  men.  The  social \nanalysis conducted during project preparation shows that there is overall gender equality, with \nwomen  accorded  equal  or  higher  status,  particularly  regarding  property  inheritance,  managing \ndomestic \nfinances,  business,  and  household  decisions  (with  women  often  heads  of \nhouseholds). The Project\u2019s water supply component will specifically benefit women because of \ntheir greater involvement in household and agricultural activities compared with men.  \n \nEconomic and Financial Benefits  \nC. \n \n \n57. \nEconomic  Benefit.  Economic  cost  benefit  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  water \nsupply, sewerage, solid waste management, and roads/drainage/transportation subcomponents \nin  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana. 23  The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  bring  as \neconomic  benefit  (i)  savings  in  resource  costs  spent  obtaining  water  from  a  private  or \n\n                                                 \n21 These safeguards include (i) full consultation with landowners and any non-titled affected people on site selection; \n(ii) ensuring that voluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people, and are linked \ndirectly  to  benefits  for  the  affected  people,  with  community  sanctioned  measures  to  replace  any  losses  that  are \nagreed  to  through  verbal  and  written  record  by  affected  people;  (iii)  any  voluntary  \u201cdonation\u201d  will  be  confirmed \nthrough verbal and written record and verified by an independent third party such as a designated non-government \norganization or legal authority; and (iv) having adequate grievance redress mechanisms in place. \n\n22  Resettlement Framework for Component A (Thimphu) is Supplementary Appendix E.  \n23 Dagana is located in the geographical corridor which includes Thimphu and Phuentsholing. \n\n \n\n\fcommunity  water  scheme  or  standpipe,  (ii)  savings  in  time  spent  treating  water,  and  (iii)  the \nvalue of incremental water supply available from the Project. The sewerage subcomponent will \nbring  (i)  savings  in  resource  costs  spent  constructing  and  maintaining  septic  tanks  and  (ii) \nreduced medical costs and productivity losses. The solid waste management subcomponent will \nbring  savings  in  (i)  time  spent  disposing  of  wastes  and  (ii)  investment  costs  for  a  new  landfill \nsite. The road/drainage/junction subcomponent will bring savings in (i) travel time and (ii) vehicle \noperating  costs.  Except  for  subcomponents  in  Dagana,  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return \n(EIRRs)  are  above  12%.  The  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  21%. 24  Preliminary  economic \nanalysis  for  the  Dagana  water  subcomponent  showed  an  EIRR  of  13.1%.  While  the  Dagana \nsewerage subcomponent showed a negative EIRR, it did not consider the potential savings in \nlandslide damage, which would be likely without wastewater management in the Project. \n \nFinancial Benefits and Financial Sustainability of the Project.  Even  though  two  city \n58. \ncorporations are moving towards financial autonomy for recurrent expenditures, they still receive \nsignificant budgetary support from the Government, while capital expenditures are fully met by \nGovernment  budgetary  allocations  without  any  debt  service  requirement.  This  budgetary \nsupport is expected to continue until the city corporations can implement revenue enhancement \nmeasures.25 Assuming  this  trend  will  continue  for  some  time,  financial  projections  for  two  city \ncorporations  are  made  against  the  sustainability  of  the  urban  services  under  the  Project.  The \nanalysis shows that the financial impact due to the Project in the recurrent budget would not be \na  significant  problem,  since  (i)  water  and  sewerage  services  from  TCC  can  achieve  full  O&M \ncost  recovery  from  2011,  (ii)  incremental  revenues  from  SWM  services  from  TCC  can  cover \ntheir  incremental  costs  fully  from  2008  by  servicing  additional  households,  (iii)  additional \nrevenues from land  and urban house taxes and service charges26 can be raised from areas to \nbe  developed  in  Thimphu,  and  (iv)  parking  revenues  in  Phuentsholing  can  provide  full \nincremental  O&M  costs  from  2012.  On  the  other  hand,  the  financial  internal  rates  of  return \n(FIRRs) for revenue-generating subcomponents in Thimphu and Dagana (i.e, water, sewerage, \nand  SWM)  are  estimated  below  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  in  the  range  of  -29%  to \n-4%, while the FIRR for the revenue-generating subcomponent in Phuentsholing (i.e., parking) \nis estimated at a substantially higher rate of 14%. This is due to the tariff for water, sewerage, \nand  SWM  being  set  on  a  basis  of  full  O&M  cost  recovery,  as  capital  costs  are  provided  as \ngrants to city corporations and the dzongkhag. While full cost recovery for urban services should \nbe  encouraged  in  the  long  term,  setting  tariffs  for  full  cost  recovery  in  the  short  term  would \nrequire  drastic,  politically  unacceptable  increases,  compromising  the  affordability  of  urban \nservices.   \n \nD. \n\n Major Risks \n\n59. \nAs the scale of civil works under the Project in Thimphu will be large, some risks arise \nthat are common to road, water, and wastewater projects. These are (i) poor detailed design of \nsubprojects;  (ii)  a  lack  of  experienced  contractors  available  for  larger  civil  work  contracts;  (iii) \npoor performance by appointed contractors; (iv) poor supervision and quality control of works by \nthe IAs; (v) construction material not being readily available; and (vi) a lack of suitably trained \noperators for completed plants.   \n \n\n                                                 \n24  See Supplementary Appendix B for details.  \n25 PCC has already approved a proposal for revenue enhancement measures and submitted it to the Government for \napproval. A similar proposal may be facilitated under the Project for TCC. However, the rates of major taxes, such \nas  land  tax  and  house  tax,  are  determined  by  the  Government,  not  by  city  corporations,  so  city  corporations  are \nconstrained in revenue enhancement tools.

LP  requires  extensive  consultations \n60. \namong stakeholders that take time to reach agreement. While assessments undertaken during \nproject  preparation  show  that  the  impacts  on  individual  affected  people  or  households  are  not \nexpected to be significant, ensuring compliance with safeguards may take time.27 It was noted \nduring project preparation that time and resources are required to conduct further consultations, \nparticularly with non-titled affected people, and ensure (i) compensation for any losses, (ii) that \nOLA  verifies  100%  of  agreements,  and  (iii)  adequate  provision  for  redressing  grievances. \nDelayed compliance with safeguards, particularly the provision of compensation, is a significant \nproject  risk.  The  Government  has  provided  the  implementation  schedule  of  the  LP  process  in \nthe  project  area,  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  and  impact  on  vulnerable \nhouseholds.28 Moreover, the legal and administrative system relating to urban infrastructure is at \nan  early  stage  of  development  and  does  not  provide  a  statutory  framework  for  LP.  Because \nGovernment-implemented LP schemes in other areas have been the subjects of two litigations, \na legal opinion is being obtained from OLA to ensure the contractual validity of the proposed LP \nscheme. Furthermore, enabling provisions for LP are included in Bhutan\u2019s proposed urban land \ndevelopment/planning law, which will be presented to the National Assembly in late 2006. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\n \nA. \n \n61.  \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  DUDES  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto  reflect \n\nin  consultation  with  ADB \n\nThe  Government  will  immediately  notify  ADB  of  any  proposed  change  to  its \nadministrative  structure  and  will  take  all  steps  necessary  to  ensure  that  project \narrangements  are  revised \nthe  new \nadministrative structure and the viability of the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that (a) all lands and rights-of-way required for the \nProject  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (b)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies  of  Bhutan,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995),  and  the  agreed  resettlement  plans  and  resettlement  framework;  (c) \npayment  of  compensation  and  other  entitlements  to  the  affected  persons  are \nmade prior to their relocation/displacement and commencement of civil works; (d) \nall  civil  works  contractors  engaged  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the \nresettlement  plans;  the applicable  laws,  regulations  and  policies  of  Bhutan;  and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, to the extent applicable to contractors; \n(e) prior to the award of contract for works, updated resettlement plans based on \nfinal  detailed  design,  endorsed  by  DUDES,  are  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval \nand  disclosure on ADB\u2019s website and to the affected persons; and (f) progress \nand  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition,  land  pooling,  and  resettlement  are \nsubmitted to ADB as set out in the resettlement plans. \nThe Government will ensure that the land pooling is implemented after free, prior, \nand  informed  consultation,  and  with  the  consent  of  the  affected  persons,  in \n\n                                                 \n27 Following  the  ADB  Operations  Evaluation  Division  report  (2000)  on  the  Kathmandu  Urban  Development  Project: \nthe post-project evaluation revealed that LP often suffers serious implementation delays but can become efficient \nwhen the preparation of new plots is combined with providing basic infrastructure (road and drainage, water supply, \nsanitation,  and  electricity).  Showing  people  the  value-addition  gained  through  donating  their  plots,  and  the \nincreased value of remaining plot they own, considerably boosts support for LP.  \n\n28 This will be required in the quarterly progress report to be submitted to ADB by the PMU.  \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nand \n\nimplementing \n\nand  management  measures, \n\ncompliance with the Resettlement Framework for Land Pooling Related-Works of \nComponent A and prior approval of ADB. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and \nimplementation of the Project is carried out in compliance with the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and in \naccordance  with  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement  plans  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB;  and  any \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction,  operation,  and \nthe \nthe  Project  will  be  minimized  by \nimplementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation \nother \nrecommendations specified in the initial environmental examination. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project will not adversely affect vulnerable \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe  project  subcomponents,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor,  health,  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  of  Bhutan  and,  in \nparticular,  (a)  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities,  (b)  provide  appropriate  facilities  (latrines,  etc.)  for  workers  and  their \nfamilies at construction campsites, and (c) undertake information and awareness \ncampaigns for construction workers on sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, \nand  human \nto \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  specific  clauses  will  be  included  in  bidding \ndocuments to ensure adherence to these provisions, and that compliance will be \nstrictly monitored during project implementation. \nThe Government will ensure that the annual recurrent budget allocation currently \nprovided  by  the  central  Government  to  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana \nshall be maintained.

Bhutan is still only a few decades old, urban areas are already \n1. \nexperiencing pressure. According to the definition followed by the Planning Commission, there \nare  28  urban  areas  in  the  country,  including  20  dzongkhag  (district)  headquarters,  two \ndangkhags (subdistricts), Phuentsholing, and five satellite towns. The total population of Bhutan, \nbased on the census carried out in 2005, is 672,425, of which the urban population is estimated \nat  around  30.9%.  Though  the  annual  national  population  growth  rate  is  estimated  at  2.5%, \nbased on Bhutan\u2019s National Health Statistics for 2000, other sources estimate it at around 3.1%. \nHowever,  Thimphu\u2019s  annual  population  growth  rate  stands  much  higher  than  the  national \naverage  and  is  currently  estimated  at  around  10%.  With  only  10%  of  its  land  arable  and  the \npopulation  growing  at  such  a  speed,  Bhutan  is  seeing  an  increasing  trend  of  rural-urban \nmigration. It is thus estimated that close to half of Bhutan\u2019s population may reside in its urban \ncenters by the year 2020. The rapid inward migration is already straining the provision of basic \nurban  services  in  the  cities  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing.  To  prepare  for  future  growth  and \nensure  sustainable  urban  development,  Bhutan  must  invest  in  improvements  in  infrastructure, \nmunicipal  planning,  and  management  capacity,  as  well  as  institutionalize  cost-recovery \npractices for its urban services.  \n \n2. \nThimphu and Phuentsholing, the two largest cities in Bhutan, are classified as Class A \ncities,1  and  Dagana  falls  under  Class  C  category.  Thimphu  is  Bhutan\u2019s  capital  and \nadministrative  center,  with  almost  half  of  the  city\u2019s  population  estimated  to  rely  directly  or \nindirectly  on  Government  wages.  Due  to  its  relatively  isolated  geographic  location,  Thimphu\u2019s \nindustrial development has been limited, and its economic activity is based mainly on retailing \ngoods and services to the population. Based on a census carried out in May 2005, Thimphu\u2019s \npopulation  is  estimated  at  around  79,000  and  to  be  growing  at  10%  annually,  while \nPhuentsholing\u2019s population is around 20,000 and growing at 3%. Since Thimphu\u2019s population is \nincreasing at more than double the national growth rate, predominantly because of rural-urban \nmigration, it is projected to reach 150,000 by 2020. Both Thimphu and Phuentsholing face the \nfull force of urban migration and urban sprawl linked to limited job opportunities in rural areas. \n \n3. \nWater  supply  in  the  core  areas  of  both  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing  reportedly  covers \naround 80% of residents. However, if the peri-urban population is taken into consideration, then \nthe Thimphu coverage is much lower, supporting the argument that, as the city attracts people \nfrom other parts of Bhutan, the expansion of the urban infrastructure is not keeping pace with \ndemand.  Similarly,  Dagana  faces  water  shortages  at  times  during  the  year,  mostly  due  to \ninadequate yield from its current water source. Lack of water treatment facilities and intermittent \nflows pose a high public health risk. Solutions to the intermittent supply problem are to ensure \nproperly  designed  headworks  and  to  secure  sources  with  sufficient  yield.  With  regard  to \nsanitation,  centralized  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems  were  built  in  mid-1990s  in \nThimphu and Phuentsholing, and service coverage is around 30\u201340% of the core areas in both \ncities. However, municipal sewerage system coverage needs to be extended in both Thimphu \nand  Phuentsholing,  considering  the  increasing  growth  pressures  in  these  areas  and  the \nresulting  increase  in  urban  densities,  which,  without  management,  will  bring  greater  risks  to \npublic  health  and  the  environment.  Unlike  in  most  urban  areas  in  the  region,  these  systems \n\n                                                 \n1  Cities are categorized according to two broad factors\u2014population  and the  urban facilities available, for  which  26 \ncriteria are applied\u2014and are assigned points based on a measure of these criteria. Category A cities are those that \nsecure 36 points or more. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\n 27 \n\nhave  separate  sewers,  which  eliminate  health  risks  associated  with  combined  storm  and \nwastewater  drainage  systems.  Water  tariffs  are  generally  low,  and  revenue  collected  covers \nmostly chemical, electrical, and some repair costs. Wastewater tariffs have been introduced by \nthe municipal governments of both Thimphu and Phuentsholing and are pegged at 50% of the \nwater rates. Therefore, the foundations for some cost recovery in the water and sanitation sub-\nsector are in place. However, due to an acute shortage of skilled professionals and technicians, \nparticularly  in  this  subsector,  systems  are  starting  to  deteriorate,  and  unaccounted-for-water \n(UFW) in both cities is typically 25% to 30%, despite the systems\u2019 not being very old. \n  \n4. \nSolid  waste  management  in  Phuentsholing  functions  satisfactorily.  Though  solid  waste \ncollection functions satisfactorily in Thimphu, waste separation and disposal management need \nimmediate attention. Municipal waste is dumped in purpose-built landfill sites in the two cities, \nbut the sites are not yet up to current international standards. The present municipal landfill site \nin  Thimphu  is  nearing  its  capacity,  and  the  composting  facility,  constructed  with  support  from \nDanish  International  Development  Aid  (Danida),  is  not  yet  operational.  Collection  of  municipal \nwaste by the two city corporations is undertaken regularly, and streets are comparatively clean \nin the two cities. In Dagana, people deposit their rubbish in communal bins or vats for eventual \nburning. This is a common practice in other rural communities throughout the country.  \n \n5. \nAs new urban settlements develop in centers such as Thimphu, a critical need exists for \nfurther investment in roads. Though existing roads in the urban centers are in a relatively good \ncondition  compared  with  roads  in  other  countries  in  the  region,  there  is  a  prominent  lack  of \nplanning  or  coordination  between  the  roads  and  services  organizations.  This  results  in  road \nconstruction  authorities  continually  receiving  criticism  for  the  need  to  excavate  newly \nconstructed  roads  to  allow  extension  of  services  such  as  water,  power,  and  communications. \nFurthermore, both old and new roads do not have adequate drainage, so that water ponds on \nthem and leaves deposits of mud and silt. \n \nWhile  a  private  housing  industry  has  emerged,  a  severe  shortage  exists  of  housing \n6. \nsuitable  for  low-  and  middle-income  urban  households.  Lack  of  access  to  urban  land  for \ndevelopment  is  a  serious  problem,  prompting  the  Government  to  undertake  land  pooling  to \nfacilitate rational urban planning.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nUrban  development,  including  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  is  the  responsibility  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement  (MoWHS).  Within  MoWHS,  the  Department  of \nUrban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) is the nodal agency with responsibility \nfor this function. DUDES consists of four divisions: (i) Urban Planning and Design Division, (ii) \nEngineering  Services  Division,  (iii)  Urban  Infrastructure  Division;  and  (iv)  Rural  Infrastructure \nDivision.  For  policymaking,  finance  management,  and  administrative  matters,  DUDES  is \ngoverned  by  the  Policy  Planning  Division  and  the  Administrative  and  Finance  Division  of \nMoWHS.   \n \nfor  urban \n8. \ndevelopment  and  services  management  are  the  respective  city  corporations,  which  are \ngoverned under the provisions of the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999. In Dagana, responsibility for \nurban  development  and  management  lies  with  the  Dagana  Dzongkhag.  The  city  corporations \nand  dzongkhag  administrations  both  lack  the  autonomy  necessary  for  them  to  act  in  a  truly \ndecentralized manner.  \n \n\nthe  principal  agencies  responsible \n\nIn  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing, \n\nUrban Sector Institutions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n      Appendix 2    \n\nfunctions.  The \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nThimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC)  was  established  in  1993,  and  its  functions  are \n9. \nreinforced  in  the  Charter  of  Thimphu  Municipal  Corporation  2003.  In  Phuentsholing,  however, \nalthough the Phuentsholing City Corporation (PCC) exists, its incorporation and legal standing \nunder  the  Bhutan  Municipal  Act  remain  pending  as  the  Government  has  not  yet  issued  the \nnecessary  charter.  Both  TCC  and  PCC  are  directed  by  municipal  committees  consisting  of \nelected  and  nominated  members  who  provide  guidance  on  policy  formulation,  establishment \nprocedures,  and  approval \ntwo  city  corporations  have  an  established \norganizational structure, regular staff, and directly employed laborers. However, in practice, the \ntechnical  capacities  of  neither  city  corporation  fully  suffices  for  undertaking  the  required  full \nrange of planning, management, and service-provision functions. \n \n10. \nThe  situation  in  Dagana  is  different.  In  line  with  other  dzongkhags,  the  dzongkhag \nadministration  of  Dagana  is  headed  by  a  dzongda  (district  administrator)  appointed  by  the \nGovernment.  The  local administration  functions  under  the  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  and \nCultural Affairs. For urban and municipal matters, the Dagana Dzongkhag administration has its \nMunicipal  Task  Group,  which  is  essentially  an  advisory  body  for  planning  and  developing \nfacilities  in  the  towns  of  the  dzongkhag.  Significantly,  this  group  does  not  have  authority \ncomparable to that of municipal committees of city corporations.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe Government is responding to the increase in urbanization in all the following policy \ndocuments.  Bhutan\u2019s  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  is  contained  in  three  documents: \nVision  2020,  the  9th  5-Year  Plan,  and  the  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  focus  of  Bhutan\u2019s \ndevelopment policy, as articulated these policy documents, is to pursue the twin goals of growth \nand poverty reduction, traditionally underpinned by a highly inclusive approach to planning. This \napproach  provides  a  sound  framework  for  guiding  internal  development  efforts  as  well  as \nexternal assistance to Bhutan.  \n \n12. \nVarious  Government  poverty  surveys  reveal  that  communities  that  are  closer  to  roads \nare  better  off  in  terms  of  economic  and  social  well-being  than  those  farther  away.  Improving \naccess  through  infrastructure  expansion  is  a  key  strategy  for  reducing  poverty,  enhancing  the \ncoverage and quality of social services and increasing economic opportunities. Starting from a \nvirtual  absence  of  economic  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  early  1960s,  steady \nprogress  has  been  registered  in  delivering  basic  services,  the  result  of  which  is  most  clearly \nreflected in steady progress to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Between 1970 and \n2000, the infant mortality rate halved, primary education enrollment rates increased fivefold, and \nlife expectancy doubled.   \n \nD. \n \n13. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  began  lending  operations  in  Bhutan  in  1983.  As  of \nMarch  2005,  ADB  had  funded  19  projects  with  a  cumulative  value  of  $111.2  million  and  90 \ntechnical assistance activities with a cumulative value of $33.7 million.2 The overarching goal of \nADB\u2019s  development  assistance  to  Bhutan,  as  articulated  in  its  country  strategy  and  program \n(2006\u20132010) for Bhutan, is poverty reduction through economic diversification. Its development \nstrategies to achieve this goal focus mainly on helping the Government reduce poverty through \nrural  electrification,  road  network  expansion,  infrastructure  improvements  in  regional  centers, \nand basic skills development. Infrastructure provision has dominated ADB\u2019s assistance portfolio \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategies \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program: (2006\u20132010): Bhutan. Manila (September).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\n 29 \n\nLessons Learned \n\nto  Bhutan.  In  1998,  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  BHU-1625  (UIIP)  was \napproved, including assistance to provide urban infrastructure for Thimphu.  \n \nE. \n \n14. \nAn evaluation of ADB\u2019s assistance to Bhutan conducted in May 2005 found that success \nis  greatest  and  most  sustained  when  ADB  maintains  long-term  sector  involvement  combined \nwith  capacity-building  programs  and  investment  support.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  as  well  as \nindependent  evaluations  of  its  past  operations,  some  of  the  key  lessons  learned  include  the \nfollowing: \n  \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nFrequent turnover of project managers adversely affects project implementation. \nProblems with land acquisition can result in project delays. \nA  solid  assessment  of  the  existing  policy  framework  is  needed  to  phase  and \nsequence sector reforms. \nInadequate  financial  resources  for  road  operation  and  maintenance  have \nresulted in infrastructure deterioration and deferred maintenance. \nClose  cooperation  among  technical  personnel involved  in  previous  projects  and \ninternational consultants should be secured to impart lessons learned. \nCapacity building of key implementation staff should be provided prior to project \ncommencement  or  in  its  early  phases  to  avoid  unnecessary  implementation \ndelays.  \n\n \n15.  Most recent ADB assistance to the urban sector was through the UIIP approved in 1998. \nLessons  learned  from  this  and  other  urban  sector  projects  show  that  lines  of  communication, \nsupervisory  roles,  and  formal  contract-monitoring  roles  linking  contractors  and  the  city \ncorporations  need  to  be  carefully  designed  and  realigned.  For  example,  contracts  for  physical \nworks under the UIIP and most other past projects were signed with the Government, while the \nproject management unit acted as their representative and the works were supervised by TCC. \nThis arrangement created difficulties in that the contractors communicated with and complained \nto the project management unit, and so did not deal with the supervising staff. Field inspections \nhave  subsequently  also  raised  doubts  about  the  quality  of  works,  with  serious  deterioration  in \nmany  of  project  works  appearing  within  2\u20133  years  of  their  completion.  Poor  workmanship  and \ninferior materials were also evident in the works. Furthermore, it was shown that a large number \nof small contracts is very difficult to manage and control. \n \n16. \ndevelopment partners, such as Danida, include the following:  \n\nKey  lessons  learned  from  other  urban  projects  funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  other \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nKey  personnel  managing  the  projects  need  to  be  located  in  the  same  office  as \nthe project manager. \nCompensation and resettlement issues need to be negotiated and finalized early \nin the project cycle, and sufficient funds need to be budgeted for and set aside in \nadvance for the compensation and resettlement agreements to be completed in \ntime. \nDUDES, the lead agency for planning, is professionally dominated by engineers, \nplanners,  and  architects  and  must  be  supplemented  with  sociologists  and \nsafeguards  experts,  an  institutional  development  specialist,  etc.,  to  be  able  to \ndeal with cross-sectoral aspects of urban development. \nThe  involvement  of  beneficiaries,  especially  during  project  identification,  is \nstrongly correlated with good outcomes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n     Appendix 3        \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\nA. \n \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector to reducing poverty in Bhutan: \n \nIn the 4 decades since the Government initiated a period of modernization, Bhutanese indicators of welfare and quality \nof  life  have  shown  significant  improvement,  especially  in  the  health,  education,  infrastructure,  and  transport  sectors. \nHowever, the rapid growth of the urban areas has significant impacts on the urban population, which in the two largest \ncities in Bhutan, Thimphu and Phuentsholing, is rapidly  growing as  urban migration  increases. Accompanying  urban \nproblems  are  shortages  in  housing,  unplanned  development,  and  improper  infrastructure  and  services.  The  most \ncrucial urban infrastructure and services lacking in Bhutan are roads, drainage, and adequate solid waste and sewage \ndisposal  systems.  The  fast  population  growth  is  also  placing  pressure  on  employment.  While  the  national  rate  of \nunemployment  is  within  2\u20133%,  the  urban  unemployment rate  is  4.1%,  with  urban  unemployment  among  those  aged \n15\u201319 as high as 10.9%. \n \nAgainst  this  background,  while  urban  poverty  is  still  considerably  low  (4.5%  in  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing), \npopulation  pressure  and  rising  unemployment,  coupled  with  a  lack  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  can  be \nexpected to worsen income and non-income poverty. The Project will contribute to improved health and general living \nstandards  for  local  populations  in  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  provide  sustainable  and  reliable  urban  services  through  more  effective  city  corporation \nmanagement,  and  improve  economic  and  social  conditions  in  the  three  towns  thanks  to  investments  in  roads, \ndrainage, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and other community facilities.  \n \nThe Project will provide improved water supply and sanitation facilities and associated health services to about 19,000 \npeople  in  poor  areas  selected  for  their  low  coverage  and  high  incidence  of  diarrhea  and  other  sanitation-related \nillness. An estimated 55,000 people will directly benefit from the urban infrastructure subcomponents. The Project will \nalso  strengthen  the  capacity  and  capability  of  staff  in  two  city  corporations,  making  them  better  able  to  upgrade \ninfrastructure in more coherently strategic manner, plan budgets for continued maintenance and repair needs, and so \nreduce  the  frequency  of  unwarranted  breakdowns.  In  addition,  predominantly  local  private  contractors  and  their \nworkers and suppliers will benefit from the flow of contracts for civil works and equipment over the project period. \n \n \nB. \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nSecondary  sources  show  that  27%  of  Bhutanese  households  live  below  the  upper  lower  poverty  line,  and  18%  live \nbelow the lower poverty line.1 Overall, the incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas, where households continue to \nrely on subsistence agriculture  without adequate access to enough land, transport, or community infrastructure. The \nincidence of poverty is higher among households practicing subsistence agriculture and those headed by agricultural \nlaborers. The urban population has lower levels of poverty, with slightly more poverty in smaller towns.  \n \nIn Thimphu and Phuentsholing 4.5% of households are poor. Food poverty affects 1.7% of households. The poverty \nassessment and analysis conducted in 2000 reveals that Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana are among the least \nvulnerable dzongkhags. Food insecurity is mainly seasonal, with Dagana the most vulnerable among the three due to \nits remoteness, bad roads, and insufficient communication facilities. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The lower poverty line (Nu612.1 per capita per month) represents the income required to satisfy basic nutrition needs \nbased on a minimum daily food energy requirement of 2,124 calories per person per day, with a minimum allowance \nfor basic non-food goods. The upper poverty line, set at Nu748.1 per capita per month, allows greater allowance for \nnon-food goods but maintains food expenditures equal to the food poverty line (Nu458.0 per capita per month). \n\n \n\n\f   \n\n        Appendix 3 \n\n31\n\n \n \nThe service sector is the main source of income in Thimphu (47%) and Phuentsholing (65%), while in Dagana most \n(76%) are engaged in business. Also important in Thimphu are business (33%) and farming (16%). In Phuentsholing, \nbusiness  activities  comprise  the  second  most  important  sector,  engaging  35%.  Businesses  are  mostly  in  trading, \nfollowed by service-related enterprises like barber shops, salons, and restaurants. Dagana\u2019s service sector has 33% \nworking in government jobs with dzongkhag power, roads, postal, police, and other departments. \n     \nIn the three project areas, the socioeconomic survey conducted by consultants during project preparation did not show \nany  head  of  household  who  was  unemployed.  The  socio-economic  survey  was  conducted  under  the  Bhutan  Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA  BHU-4533  approved  in  December  2004). \nPrimary  data  revealed  that,  in  both  the  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing  project  areas,  most  households  are  middle \nincome, earning between Nu5,001 to Nu10,000 per month, and in the service sector. Even though abject poverty was \nnot found in the project areas, 12% in Thimphu and 7% in Phuentsholing earned between Nu2,000 and Nu3,000 per \nmonth. The socioeconomic survey reported average monthly household incomes of Nu2,874 in Thimphu, Nu3,441 in \nPhuentsholing, and Nu4,641 in Dagana. \n \nDeficiencies in access to basic needs, particularly drinking water, was noted in the project areas. The socioeconomic \nsurvey shows that overall consumption of  water is approximately 28\u201333 liters per capita per day in the three project \nareas. Low pressure, insufficient quantity, irregular supply, and murky water are some of the complaints reported by \nrespondents in the project areas. Forty-two percent of households in Thimphu and  64% in Phuentsholing have water \nsupplied for only 1\u20132 hours per day,  while 32% in Thimphu and 33% in Phuentsholing have  water for 2\u20133 hours. In \nDagana,  water  is  supplied  in  the  central  area  continuously,  and  limited  community  stand  posts  exist.  Waterborne \ndiseases,  particularly  diarrhea,  jaundice  and  typhoid,  were  noted  in  all  three  project  areas,  exacerbated  by  poor  or \nnon-existent sewage and solid waste treatment. \n \n \nC.           Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder  consultations  were  undertaken  during  project  preparation.  Stakeholders  consulted  include  project  area \nresidents,  anticipated  project  beneficiaries  and  affected  peoples,  and  community  leaders  such  as  local  area \nrepresentatives and city committee members; the national  Government (the  Department of Urban  Development  and \nEngineering  Services  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement,  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  National \nEnvironment  Commission,  and  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt  Management  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  local \ngovernments (Thimphu City Corporation, Phuentsholing City Corporation, and Dagana District administration); donors \nin the sector (Danish International Development Aid [Danida] and World Bank); and the Office of Legal Affairs. \n \nSocioeconomic surveys and consultations resulted in a ranking of community needs. In the project areas, roads, city \nbeautification,  drainage,  sewerage,  and  water  supply  were  ranked  as  priorities.  All  issues  and  suggestions  raised \nduring stakeholder consultations have been considered during project design.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nParticipation is vital to the Project, particularly where land pooling will be used. The resettlement plan and resettlement \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  A  and  Appendix  11)  detail  arrangements  for  consultation,  information \ndissemination,  disclosure,  and  grievance  redress,  for  which  the  participation  of  anticipated  project  beneficiaries  and \naffected persons is key.  \n \nD. \n \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project  will have no negative gender impacts. The significant environmental and public health benefits from the \nProject will accrue to both women and men. The social analysis conducted during project preparation shows that there \nis  overall  gender  equality,  with  women  accorded  equal  or  higher  status,  particularly  regarding  property  inheritance, \nmanaging  domestic  finances,  business,  and  household  decisions  (with  women  often  heading  households).  The \nProject\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  specifically  benefit  women  because  of  their  higher  involvement  in  household \nand agricultural activities compared with men. \n\nGender Development \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n     Appendix 3        \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \nE. \n \nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nIn  Thimphu, \n\nthere  will  be  no \n\nThe  Project  will  entail  the  permanent  acquisition  of  only \n1.1 hectares of land for  water and  wastewater treatment, \naffecting  two  households  in  Dagana.  While  there  will  be \nno land acquisition in Phuentsholing, one commercial and \nfour residential structures owned by the Government, and \na  Government  plot  leased  for  use  as  a  scrap  yard,  are \nrequired  for  the  Project.  New  residential  quarters  will  be \nprovided to the four affected households, and impacts on \nleaseholders  and  their  10  employees  entitle  them  to \ncompensation. \nland \nacquisition but land requirements will be obtained through \nland pooling, which will affect an estimated 497 seasonal \nImpacts  are  not \nleaseholders. \nworkers  and  173 \nanticipated  to  be  substantial,  as  the  affected  sources  of \nincome  are  not  significant.  The  socioeconomic  survey  of \naffected  people  shows  that  the  average  seasonal  worker \nis employed for only 9 or 10 days per year. \nWater,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  tariff \nincreases  will  not  have  significant  negative  impacts  on \nproject beneficiaries. The increase in all tariffs constitutes \nan  increase  of  only  1.4%  of  beneficiaries\u2019  household \nincome.  To  ensure  affordability,  higher  rates  will  be \ncharged to consumers in higher consumption slabs. \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  in  construction  and \noperations.  \n\nSocial assessments undertaken during project preparation \ndo  not  indicate  significant  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable \ngroups and did not identify any indigenous people, as the \nproject  areas\u2019  urban  populations  are  fully  mainstreamed. \nThe  resettlement  plan  provides  additional  compensation \nto vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, if any \nare found to be affected during detailed design. \nNo other risks or vulnerabilities have been identified. \n\n Full \n\n \n\n Short \nresettlement \nplan and \nresettlement \nframework for \nland pooling \n \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes  \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 4 \n\n33\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR IN BHUTAN \n \n\nProject \n \n. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                         Year          Source       Amount \n         Approved                       ($ million) \n \n\n1983 \n1983 \n1984 \n1986 \n1993 \n1998 \n2000  \n2005 \n1999  \n\n 0.38 \n  ADB \n5.00 \n  ADB \n5.10 \n  ADB \n1.50 \n  ADB \n 5.20 \n  ADB \n5.70 \n  ADB \n12.8 \n  ADB \n  ADB \n34.1 \n  World Bank  10.8  \n\nA.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Project  was  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The salient points from the IEE are summarized below. \n \nB. \n \nThe topographical features of the country are the High Himalayas in the northern region \n2. \nwith  many  peaks  and  plateaus,  ranges  and  deep  valleys  running  north-south  in  the  central \nregion, and foothills in the south of the country. The country is divided into two broad geological \nzones, the Lesser Himalayan belt along the southern and southeastern border and the Tethyan \nbelt in remaining parts. The climate is wet and hot in the south, dry and cold in the north, dry \nand warm in the inner valleys, moist and cool on the north-south ranges, and alpine to arctic in \nthe High Himalayas.   \n \nWater  resources  in  Bhutan,  fed  by  precipitation  over  the  mountain  and  hills,  consist \n3. \nprincipally  of  a  network  of  mountain  streams  and  rivers,  which  form  four  major  river  basins. \nGroundwater  occurs  in  porous  sediments  and  fractured  rock  deposits  around  the  country, \nfeeding  seasonal  or  perennial  springs  that  are  an  important  water  source  in  rural  areas,  as  is \nevident from frequent springs on hillsides around the country.  \n \n4. \nBhutan has a wide variety of plants in three main eco-floristic zones: alpine, temperate, \nand sub-tropical. Bhutan is situated within a biodiversity hotspot, an area that extends in an arc \nfrom Northern Pakistan across Nepal to Bhutan and northeast India. Bhutan has nine protected \nareas, four of which are designated as national parks, four as wildlife sanctuaries, and one as a \nstrict nature reserve. Some areas are identified as biological corridors. There are no protected \nareas and biological corridors in or around project areas. \n \nC. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n5. \nImpacts  due  to  Location  and  Design.  In  Thimphu,  some  stream  water  from  the \nproposed  source  stream  is  currently  used  for  irrigation  and  domestic  drinking  water.  Potential \nusage conflicts will be mitigated by keeping levels of extraction well below the dry season flow \nas required by law, and a facility for monitoring stream level has been established to determine \nthese levels. Sewerage lines are to be laid in all project towns. Potential contamination of water \nin supply pipes from sewage pipes laid in the same trench will be avoided by ensuring that pipes \nare offset, laid at separate levels, and constructed with strong materials. Problems  associated \nwith blockage in the sewerage system will be avoided by adequate design of the system and the \nprovision  of  secure  connections  and  watertight  manhole  covers  to  keep  storm  water  from \nentering the system. The risk of overflow from the treatment plant will be avoided by designing \nthe plant to adequate capacity, including an additional margin to enable it to withstand storms. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n           Appendix 10 \n\n45\n\nImpacts during Construction. Noise and dust are likely to be caused by the excavation \n6. \nof  trenches  and  operation  of  vehicles  and  machinery.  Mitigation  during  construction  will  be  by \nmeans of limiting work times to daylight hours, providing information to the public, covering or \nwetting  stockpiles  during  windy  conditions  and  maintaining  vehicles  and  machinery  in  good \noperable  condition.  Similarly,  fuel  spills  will  be  limited  by  good  vehicle  and  machinery \nmaintenance. \n  \n7. \nRoad traffic is likely to be impeded by excavation works for both service installation and \nroad  improvement  works.  This  will  be  mitigated  by  providing  information  to  the  public  on  the \ntiming  and  duration  of  operations  that  affect  traffic  flows  and  using  traffic  management \nmeasures such as erecting temporary signage and providing diversions.  \n \nThe release of silt from materials or piles of construction waste will be mitigated by using \n8. \nsilt traps or cutoff drains as necessary, promptly and properly disposing of excavated material, \nthe timely delivery of materials to work sites, and, where feasible, limiting excavation work to the \ndry season.  \n \n9. \nChemicals and fuels used in construction pose a risk at construction sites. This risk will \nbe  reduced  by  requiring  the  contractor  to  store  these  items  in  secure  facilities  and  to  collect \nwaste  from  workshops  and  dispose  of  it  at  approved  sites.  Toilet  facilities  will  be  provided  to \nprevent the release of raw sewage from worksites or temporary accommodation.  \n \n10. \nDust,  noise,  and  dangers  from  quarrying  operations  will  be  avoided  by  sourcing  road \nmaterials from only licensed quarries in approved locations. Air pollution from asphalt production \nwill be avoided by using the asphalt plant in Thimphu, which has been installed to international \nstandards,  and,  in  Dagana  and  Phuentsholing,  by  appropriately  siting  the  mobile  plant, \ncontrolling dust and silt release, and using an approved fuel for heating the bitumen.  \n \nSafety  risks  to  workers  are  not  great  but  can  occur  as  a  result  of  traffic  accidents,  the \n11. \nhandling of hazardous materials, and the excavation of trenches. Contractors will be required to \n(i) train and brief workers on safety precautions and their responsibilities, (ii) provide protective \nclothing, (iii) ensure that plant operators and drivers are appropriately trained and licensed, (iv) \nmake  adequate  arrangements  for  emergency  treatment,  and  (v)  provide  warning  signs  for  the \npublic.  \n \n12. \nThe  risk  of  damage  to  utilities  and  private  property  will  be  mitigated  by  detailed  site \ninspections prior to the commencement of works, adequate site supervision, and the provision \nof an emergency supply of repair materials for incidents such as burst water pipes.  \n \n13. \nUpgrading  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Thimphu  and  the  wastewater  pumps  in \nPhuentsholing poses the risk of released raw sewage while the work is in progress. This will be \nmitigated by careful construction planning, providing emergency standby pumps, maintaining a \ncontinual treatment stream, procedures for disinfection and containment of raw or partly treated \nsewage, and delaying new connections until rehabilitation work is complete.  \n \n14. \nImpacts during Operation. Improvements to roadside and storm drains will potentially \nresult  in  the  rapid  passage  of  pollutants  and  contaminants  to  the  river  system,  particularly  if \nhazardous  substances  are  carelessly  discarded  by  the  public  or  drains  are  not  adequately \nmaintained.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  gross  pollutant  traps  are  to  be  installed  at  drain  outflows  in \nThimphu,  and  simple  trapping  devices  will  be  installed  in  Dagana.  To  encourge  public \nparticipation  in  keeping  the  environment  clean,  a  program  to  raise  public  awareness  will  be \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n    Appendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\nincluded  in  the  Project.  Issues  of  maintenance  will  be  addressed  by  means  of  a  project  \ncomponent on operation-and-maintenance capacity building.  \n \n15. \nIn  the  catchment  area  for  the  new  water  supply,  there  is  a  potential  risk  that  future \nsettlement,  intensified  grazing,  or  other  land  uses  that  may  impair  the  watershed.  This  will  be \nprevented  by  designating  the  area  as  a  critical  watershed  under  the  Forest  and  Nature \nConservation Act of 1995. \n \nThe  use  of  chlorine  for  water  treatment,  or  of  any  other  hazardous  chemicals,  may \n16. \npresent  risks  to  plant  operators  and  the  public  if  not  properly  stored,  handled,  and  used.  This \naspect  will  also  be  addressed  through  the  component  on  operation-and-maintenance  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \n17. \nThe augmentation and expansion of the water supply in Thimphu will potentially increase \nsewage  flow  in  the  town.  The  corresponding  expansion  of  the  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment capacity will ensure that this extra volume can be adequately handled.  \n \n18. \nSludge will be produced from both the water and wastewater treatment facilities. In the \ncase  of  water  treatment,  sludge  production  will  be  low  as  the  source  water  has  low  turbidity. \nSludge  from  the  water  treatment  plant  will  however  contain  pollutants  such  as  alum  and  will \nneed  to  be  disposed  of  at  the  city  landfill  or  other  approved  site.  Desludging  the  wastewater \ntreatment plant will be more frequent, but sludge from this plant will be suitable for re-use.  \n \n19. \nPests  and  odors  from  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Thimphu  and  Dagana  will  be \nmitigated by the provision of an adequate buffer distance between the plant and nearby homes, \nas has been provided for by the siting of the existing plant in Thimphu.  \n \nD. \n \n20. \nthe  National \nEnvironment  Commission  (NEC),  which  is  empowered  to  issue  environmental  clearances  and \nnational  standards.  Responsibility  for  day-to-day  environmental  monitoring  in  connection  with \nurban infrastructure rests with the city corporations in the case of Thimphu and Phuentsholing \nand the dzongkhag administration in the case of Dagana.1 \n  \n21. \nDuring project implementation, a project management unit (PMU) will be established in \nthe Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES), which will provide \ntechnical  assistance  as  well  as  project  management  support.  However,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  policy,  the  agencies  with  principal  responsibility  for  supervising \nproject  implementation  will  be  the  Thimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC),  Phuentsholing  City \nCorporation (PCC), and Dagana Dzongkhag administration. During implementation, these three \nagencies will each be supported by a project implementation unit (PIU).  \n \n22. \nFor  environmental  monitoring,  DUDES  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  required \nmitigation  is  taken  into  account  during  the  detailed  design  phase.  During  construction,  the \n                                                 \n1   In Thimphu, management of urban infrastructure and associated environmental monitoring is the responsibility of \nthe  Thimphu  City  Corporation,  which  has  autonomous  status  under  the  Charter  of  the  Thimphu  Municipal \nCorporation,  2003.  In  Phuentsholing,  the  role  is  taken  by  the  Phuentsholing  City  Corporation,  which  is  to  attain \nsimilar autonomous status in the near future but currently comes under the Department of Urban Development and \nEngineering  Services  (DUDES).  The  relevant  authority  in  Dagana  is  the  district  (or  dzongkhag)  administration, \nwhich has an engineering section that receives advisory and technical support from DUDES. \n\nfor  environmental  management \n\nInstitutional Requirements  \n\nresponsibility \n\nrests  with \n\nOverall \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n           Appendix 10 \n\n47\n\nsupervising  role  will  fall  to  the  local  authority  agencies  concerned,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nPIU.  In  Thimphu,  a  full-time  environment  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  assist  with  compliance \nmonitoring  of  project  works.  In  Phuentsholing,  where  the  scale  of  project  works  is  smaller, \nenvironmental compliance monitoring supervision will be carried out by the PCC\u2019s environment \nwing.  In  Dagana,  where  fewer  works  will  be  carried  out,  the  dzongkhag  administration\u2019s \nengineering  section  will  carry  out  compliance  monitoring,  with  advice  and  assistance  from  the \nhead of the PIU.  \n \nDuring the operation phase, primary data gathering will remain the responsibility of the \n23. \nthree  implementing  agencies,  with  the  NEC  taking  the  coordinating  role.  Environmental \nmonitoring\u2014and  collecting  information  for  environmental  management  generally\u2014is  currently \nbeing  developed  according  to  a  strategy  devised  by  NEC  with  the  assistance  of  Danish \nInternational Development Aid (Danida) for an environmental information management system. \nThe  implementation  of  this  strategy  commenced  in  late  2004.  Under  the  Danida-funded \nEnvironment  and  Urban  Sector  Project  Support,  environmental  information  management \nsystems are being established in the towns of Gelephu, Damphu, Gyalphosing, Trashigang, and \nSamtse, with the intention of establishing the system in all towns in the country.  \n \nE. \n \nUnder  the  Project,  environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  compliance \n24. \nwith  specified  mitigation  measures  during  design,  construction,  and  operation,  and  to  assess \nchanges, perceived or measured, in certain environmental parameters before, during, and after \nconstruction.  Changes  in  the  environment,  as  perceived  by  project  beneficiaries,  will  be \ndetermined  through  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Further  changes  will  be \nmeasured by means of water, leachate, and sludge monitoring at selected sites. The monitoring \nprogram will (i) ensure compliance with the environmental monitoring plan (EMP); (ii) check the \nnature and extent of environmental effects, identifying emerging problems at an early stage; (iii) \nprovide a comparison of the situation before and after the Project; and (iv) provide data that will \nbe of value in planning further urban infrastructure improvements and upgrades. The EMP and \ninstitutional arrangements have been developed following an assessment of existing capacities \nfor environmental monitoring in Bhutan.2  \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\n                                                 \n2  Compliance  Monitoring. Compliance  with required mitigation,  as specified  in the EMP,  will be monitored  during \ndesign, construction, and operation of the Project. During detailed design, the agency with responsibility to ensure \nthat  mitigation  measures  are  incorporated  during  detailed  design  is  DUDES.  Besides  the  mitigation  measures \nspecified in the EMP, DUDES will be responsible for ensuring that the EMP is afforded full contractual standing in \nthe bid documents.  \nEnvironmental Monitoring in the Project Performance Monitoring System. Under this system, changes in the \nenvironment  as  perceived  by  project  beneficiaries  will  be  determined.  Beneficiaries  will  be  asked  about  the \nfollowing parameters relevant to the health of their urban environment. These are detailed in the IEE. \nWater, Sludge, and Leachate Monitoring. Water quality monitoring will be carried out to check for changes in key \nparameters, as an indication of the performance project infrastructure such as gross pollutant traps and the landfill \nat  Thimphu,  and  to  detect  any  deterioration  in  quality.  National  standards  for  water  are  published  in  relation  to \nindustrial discharges. Relevant standards for ambient freshwater and drinking water have not yet been developed \nfor Bhutan, but recommendations in The State of the Environment: Bhutan 2001 provide useful interim standards. \nA  list  of  required  parameters  and  appropriate  standards  in  given  in  the  IEE.  The  frequency  of  water  quality \nmonitoring will be quarterly during construction and biannually during operation. Monitoring may be carried out by \nthe  city  corporations,  which  may  undertake  the  required  monitoring  on  behalf  of  the  Dagana  Dzongkhag \nadministration.  \nSludge  will  be  produced  by  the  water  treatment  plant  and  the  wastewater  treatment  plant.  In  the  case  of  sludge \nfrom  the  water  treatment  plant,  its  composition  is  largely  known  from  standard  testing  by  TCC.  In  the  case  of \nsludge  from  the  wastewater  treatment  plant,  which  is  to  be  made  available  for  agricultural  and  horticultural  use, \nmonitoring of persistent toxins is necessary to establish its safety and suitability for these purposes. Monitoring for \nheavy metals is recommended for this purpose.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n    Appendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nF. \n \n25. \nConsultations  took  place  during  IEE  preparation  to  gather  the  views  of  principal \nstakeholders and experience from previous and current projects involved in urban management, \nand  to  determine  the  concerns  and  insights  of  the  public  in  the  project  area  regarding  the \nProject.3 The issues raised by the public and residents of the three towns accord overall with the \nproject components and its commencement is keenly anticipated. There is a strong consensus \non the need for a program to raise public awareness and elicit greater community cooperation \non  issues  such  as  the  management  of  waste.  Issues  relating  to  the  current  water  supply  and \nwaste problems were raised in almost all areas, while other issues of importance included flood \nrisks, drainage problems, road access, slope stabilization, and problems associated with poorly \nmanaged  construction  sites.  The  proposed  component  to  raise  public  awareness  received \nstrong support and a number of suggestions.  \n \n26. \nFurther  consultation  is  required  under  the  Regulation  for  Environmental  Clearance  of \nProjects  of  2002,  which  requires  the  public  disclosure  of  the  findings  of  the  completed \nenvironmental assessment.  \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nG. \n \nThe  selection  of  project  components  focused  on  considering  the  most  severe \n27. \nenvironmental  risks,  alleviation  of  waste-accumulation  problems,  and  use  of  appropriate  and \nreadily adopted technology. The Project will not generate any significant negative environmental \nimpacts.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts,  mostly  associated  with  construction,  are \nfor \ntemporary  and \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  (ii)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  identifying \nmonitoring  parameters  and  responsible  agencies  to  ensure  that  mitigation  measures  are \nproperly  undertaken  and  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  are  addressed.  The  IEE \nconcludes that no further assessment on environmental impacts is required beyond issues to be \nreviewed during detailed design. \n\nIEE  contains  (i)  environmental  management  plans \n\nlocalized.  The \n\n                                                 \n\nIn  the  case  of  leachate,  the  presence  or  not  of  heavy  metals  must  be  determined  to  confirm  that  leachate  can \nsafely  be  treated  in  the  wastewater  treatment  plant.  In  addition,  biological  oxygen  demand  and  chemical  oxygen \ndemand  should  be  monitored  and  results  recorded  to  gauge  the  overall  level  of  pollutants  entering  the  landfill. \nMonitoring the efficacy of containing and controlling leachate flows will be apparent from water quality monitoring.  \n    Heavy metal testing involves the use of sophisticated spectroscopy techniques, which are not currently available in \nBhutan. Sampling can however be arranged in laboratories in the region. On detection of traces of heavy metals, \nrisks and corrective action will be identified on a case-by-case basis. Elements to be tested are mercury, cadmium, \narsenic lead, zinc, and copper. \n\n3  Meetings with members of the public and community representatives took place with groups of individuals following \na basic agenda that presented a summary of the proposed works under the Project and of project objectives and \nlikely  positive  and  negative  environmental  impacts,  including  construction  phase  and  operational  impacts. \nAttendees of the meeting were informed of effects such as nuisance in the form of noise, dust, and possible traffic \nimpedance during construction. Feedback was sought in respect of any areas of concern that the public may have \nand their suggested means of implementation. Finally, attendees and interviewees were asked about their general \nlevel of acceptance, or otherwise, of the Project. \n\n \n \n\n\f         Appendix 11 \n\n49\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nFOR LAND POOLING-RELATED WORKS OF COMPONENT A (THIMPHU) \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe Urban Infrastructure Development Project (the Project) Component A comprises two \nparts: (i) city-level works (water supply, upgrading the existing wastewater treatment plant, and \nsolid  waste  management)  and  (ii)  roads  and  drainage,  and  water  supply  and  sewerage \nconnection  in  four  extended  areas  of  southern  Thimphu.  To  deliver  part  (ii)  the  Thimphu  City \nCorporation  (TCC)  has  studied  various  urban  development  methods.  Based  on  extensive \ndiscussions  and  consultations  with  local  residents,  TCC\u2019s  evaluation  shows  that  land  pooling \n(LP)  is  the  most  suited  option  given  plot  configurations,  topographical  conditions,  and \nenvisioned  local  area  plan  (LAP)  development.  LP  is  a  technique  for  carrying  out  the  unified \nservicing  and  subdivision  of  separate  landholdings  for  planned  urban  development.  It  is  also \nknown as urban land consolidation, land readjustment, land replotting, and land redistribution in \nvarious countries because it involves these processes.1  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nLP  will  be  undertaken  in  Babesa,  Changbangdu,  Lungtenphu,  and  Simtokha.  The  total \narea required for establishing urban infrastructure facilities (roads, drainage, water supply, and \nsewerage  connections),  public  amenities,  and  green  areas  is  99  hectares  (ha).  Consultations \nwere key in developing LAPs and the LP process. The key issues raised during consultations \nwere  addressed  in  the  following  manner:  LP  will  (i)  exclude  traditional  villages2  and  keep \nneighbors together to the extent possible, (ii) ensure no impacts on residential and commercial \nstructures (impacts on other structures such as boundary walls and other assets such as trees \nwill be compensated at replacement cost), (iii) not allocate reserve plots from the local area to \nfinance  LP,  (iv)  include  government  land  to  reduce  the  contribution  required  from  each \nlandowner,  and  (v)  minimize  shifts  in  the  land  plot  owned  but  where  required  due  to  the  plot \nbeing rendered inefficient from the perspective of future structures, new plots will be within the \nsame local area with similar physical characteristics.  \n \n\nLand Pooling Process in Thimphu \n\n1. \n\nPlanning Process \n\n \n3. \nDocumentation  of  all  land  ownership  is  first  collected.  Land  ownership  certificates  are \nthen  assessed  against  the  land  survey.  Any  discrepancies  have  to  be  resolved  by  agreement \nwith the landowners concerned. \n \n4. \nSmall  Plots.  Some  plots  exist  that  are  smaller  than  the  minimum  permitted  size  for \nstructures  (4,000  square  feet,  or  372  square  meters),  and  some  other  plots  will  fall  below  the \nminimum after they have been pooled. These plots will be shifted to allow owners to use them \nfor structures. If the landowner has a larger plot nearby, the small plot will be shifted adjacent to \nthe  large  plot.  Small  plots  belonging  to  landowners  with  no  other  plots  nearby  will  be  situated \nadjacent  to  other  smaller  plots  to  give  landowners  the  opportunity  to  build  structures  by \namalgamating  with  other  small  plots.  Prior  to  LP,  all  plots  are  classified  as  wetlands,  so  that \nlandowners are not allowed to build any structure regardless of plot size. With LP, landowners, \n\n                                                 \n1   It is widely used in Japan; South Korea; and Taipei, China and in some cities in Australia and Canada. A somewhat \nsimilar technique known as plot reconstitution is used in some cities in India. LP has also been applied in an ADB-\nfunded project in Nepal. \n\n2  A  traditional  village  is  an  enclosed  area  with  traditional  structures  (houses,  warehouses,  and  animal  sheds)  that \n\nhas historical value for conservation identified in the LAP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nincluding  small-plot  owners  that  opt  to  amalgamate  their  holdings,  will  be  able  to  build \nresidential  and  commercial  structures  on  their  plots.  The  shifted  small  plots  will  be  within  the \nsame local area have similar physical characteristics. The requirements for shifting to new plots \nare discussed in the resettlement framework\u2019s principles. \n \n5. \nContribution Ratios. The contribution ratio from different landowners will be similar to \nthe  extent  possible.  Based  on  evaluations  by  TCC,  the  contributions  required  to  optimize  LP \naverages 29% and will not exceed 30%. The contribution ratio may vary within the site to reflect \nthe proportion of land that a landowner may have already contributed to create existing access \nroads.  \n \n6. \nMoratoriums.  Official  approval  will  be  sought  for  LP  when  the  project  implementation \nunit (PIU) is adequately established, staffed, and equipped. The PIU should be close to the site \n(or alternatively have a temporary branch located at the site) so that affected persons (AP) can \nvisit  it and consult easily. When LP is formally endorsed, a moratorium on land transfers and \ncultivation  will  be  declared.  Public  notices  will  be  displayed  on  the  site  and  in  mass  media  to \nannounce the start of the LP process. \n\n \n2. \n\nLegal Process \n\n \nA  voluntary  contractual  framework  forms  the  basis  for  LP.  Landowners  volunteer  to \n7. \ncontribute a portion of their land after considering other options for urban land development and \nprovide  their  written  consent/agreement  after  free,  prior,  and  informed  consultations.  The  LP \nprocess is then approved and implemented by TCC. \n \n8. \nWhere there is no land ownership certificate, if local information can substantiate claims, \nland will be registered and a temporary certificate issued, prior to a permanent certificate after \npooling. Only land properly titled and free of encroachment or disputes will be included in LP. LP \nwill  include  clear  building  by-laws  comprising  regulations  on  plot  development  including  plot \ncoverage,  maximum  height,  set  back  and  side  margins,  architectural  appearance,  wastewater \ndisposal,  fire  protection,  etc.  It  will  also  include  planning  by-laws  comprising  regulations \ngoverning  the  land  uses  and  activities  that  may  take  place  on  the  site,  as  determined  by  the \npredominant  land-use  zones.  These  by-laws  will  be  established  and  agreed  with  landowners \nand come into force when layout plans are formally approved and the moratorium lifted. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nExtent of LP Area and Landowners Affected. The total area required for establishing \nurban infrastructure facilities (roads, drainage, water supply, and sewerage connections), public \namenities, and green areas is 99 ha. Of this area, 53.7 ha, or 54.2%, will be from contributions \nof  898  landowners;3  45.3  ha,  or  45.8%,  will  be  the  Government\u2019s  contribution.  The  average \ncontribution is 29% from affected plots. The maximum contribution is 30%.  \n \n10. \nAgreement of Landowners. Agreement from 100% of landowners on a zonal basis is \nrequired for ADB financing. Written consents/agreements have been made for contributing to LP \nbetween  the  TCC  and  landowners  since  12  March  2003.  Consistent  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies, the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) was identified in 2005 as the legal authority to verify \n\nIssues in the Four Thimphu Extended Areas Land Pooling Process \n\n                                                 \n3   A socioeconomic profile of landowners is in the resettlement plan. \n\n \n \n\n\f         Appendix 11 \n\n51\n\nthe consents/agreements.4 The OLA will ensure that there is no coercion and that landowners \nunderstand that they have the right to refuse to participate in LP.5 The OLA will provide quarterly \nreports  to  ADB  on  the  consent/agreements  verified.  Where  100%  consent/agreement  is  not \nobtained, TCC will redefine the zone to exclude the plots of landowners who do not consent. If \nrezoning is not feasible, ADB will not finance urban development through LP in that zone.  \n \n11. \nAt the stage of redistributing resized plots to landowners, another agreement is executed \nthat  identifies  the  extent  of  land  contributed  and  contains  a  post-LP  lot  plan.  The  thram \n(inventory of individual land holdings owned by a single household) is not amended in the entire \nprocess. However, the location of the plot attached to the thram is amended, and TCC issues \nan updated ownership certificate to the landowners.  \n \n12.  Minimizing Impacts on Landowners. Impacts on landowners are minimized through (i) \nlimiting  the  contribution  required  and  (ii)  minimizing  impacts  on  living  standards.  To  limit \ncontributions  required,  (i)  LP  contributions  will  be  kept  to  similar  percentages  to  the  extent \npossible and will not exceed 30% and (ii) the Government, to the extent possible, will include its \nland  to  reduce  LP  contributions.  To  minimize  impacts  on  living  standards,  LP  will  exclude \ntraditional  villages  and  land  with  residential  and  commercial  structures,  and  LP  will  minimize \nshifts in land plot. Inefficient building plots of less than 4,000 square feet will be considered for \nshifting. When shifting the location of plots, the reallocated plot will be within the same zone. \n \n13. \nBenefits to Landowners. Landowners contributing to LP will directly benefit from roads, \ndrainage,  and  water  supply  and  sewerage  connections.  An  economic  analysis  for  the  Project \nestimates that, for a typical landowner who owns 1.9 ha and contributes 29% of his land, the net \neconomic benefit from LP will be Nu478,000 per person, which is 15 times the economic value \nof the land without LP. During consultation, landowners will be informed by the Government of \nthe Project\u2019s implementation schedule and the expected timeframe for delivering benefits. \n \nVulnerable  Affected  People.  During  project  preparation,  three  categories  of  affected \n14. \npeople were identified as requiring compensation and assistance. A sample survey showed that \nLP  will  have  impacts  on  vulnerable  landowning  households  and  such  non-titled  APs \n(leaseholders/tenants  and  agricultural  workers/employees).  While  the  sample  survey  does  not \nindigenous  peoples-headed \nreflect  single  parent \nhouseholds, there are an estimated 54 landowning households with reported incomes below the \npoverty  line.  The  survey  also  indicates  potential  impacts  on  an  estimated  497  seasonal \nagricultural workers  and  173  leaseholders.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  to  address \nresettlement impacts for vulnerable APs (Supplementary Appendix F). The entitlement matrix is \nshown in Table A11.1.  \n \n15.  While the survey shows that the average seasonal worker is employed for 9 or 10 days \nper year, and that impacts on seasonal workers are therefore not anticipated to be significant, a \nsocioeconomic  survey  on  agricultural  workers/employees  and  leaseholders/tenants  will  be \nundertaken  during  the  preparation  of  an  updated  resettlement  plan  for  Component  A  at  the \ndetailed  design  stage.  A  socioeconomic  survey  of  landowners  and  an  assessment  of \nvulnerabilities will also be conducted as part of updating the resettlement plan. The number of \n\nfemale-headed,  disabled-headed,  or \n\n                                                 \n4 The OLA, formed in 1998, is the legal authority that advises various government agencies on legal matters. Under \nOLA\u2019s legal services drafting division, a lawyer has been assigned to witness and verify voluntary donations from \nlandowners. \n\n5    A  further  third  party  will  be  identified  and  included  as  witness  on  the  side  of  the  landowner  based  on  the  legal \n\nopinion by OLA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthe  project  manager.  The  PMU\u2014with \n\naffected people will be confirmed through the socioeconomic surveys. In addition to vulnerable \nhouseholds  identified  in  the  resettlement  plan  because  they  were  headed  by  single-parent \nfemales or indigenous people, special attention will be paid to ensure sensitivity to vulnerability \nfrom (i) loss of land resulting in reduced income or source of subsistence, (ii) being close to the \npoverty threshold and thus at risk of falling below the poverty from loss of land, and (iii) other \nsources  of  vulnerabilities.  Understanding  vulnerabilities  is  required  to  ensure  that  the \nentitlements  and  assistance  provided  are  appropriate.  ADB  must  review  and  approve  the \nrevised resettlement plan prior to the award of civil works contracts, and compensation of APs is \nrequired prior to the commencement of civil works. \n \n16. \nImplementation  of  LP.  The  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Engineering \nServices (DUDES) of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS) will execute the \nADB-financed  Project.  DUDES  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  located  on \nDUDES  premises  and  headed  by \nthree \nprofessional/technical  staff  and  two  support  staff,  and  supported  by  a  team  of  project \nmanagement  consultants\u2014will  be  the  key  organization  ensuring  the  execution  of  the  Project. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  the  Project.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established in  Thimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC)  and  have  15 \nprofessional/technical  staff  and \nfour  support  staff.  The  TCC  currently  has  seven \nprofessional/technical staff for the Project, and the rest of the staff requirement will be recruited. \nThe PIU will manage day-to-day operations and implement the resettlement framework. \n \n17. \nA  social  development  specialist  (SDS)  for  Thimphu  in  the  PMU  will  coordinate  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  through  the  PIU  with  support  from  the  project  management \nconsultant\u2019s  resettlement  specialist.  Resettlement  plan  implementation  (excluding  monitoring, \nwhich will be undertaken throughout the project period) is expected to be completed within 12 \nmonths. Resettlement framework implementation and oversight of framework monitoring will be \ndirectly  undertaken  by  the  SDS  at  the  PMU  in  coordination  with  the  sociologists  at  the  PIU. \nExternal monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the independent monitor engaged for \nthe resettlement plan. Local area representatives6 or city committee members who act as liaison \nbetween  APs  and  TCC  will  first  hear  grievances.  Institutional  roles  and  responsibilities  are \nfurther detailed in the resettlement plan. \n \n18. \nGrievance  Redress.  Any  grievances  of  landowners  or  non-titled  affected  people  can \nfirst be brought to the attention of the local area representative for the LAP or the elected city \ncommittee members. Grievances not redressed within 15 days will be brought to the PIU, and \nthe PIU head will coordinate with the TCC public consultation cell for redress. Grievances not \nredressed by the PIU within 15 days will be brought to the Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nCommittee7  acting  as  a  grievance  redress  committee.  The  committee  will  meet  when  a \ngrievance  is  not  resolved  by  the  PIU.  Members  will  be  given  notice  of  the  meeting,  meet  to \ndetermine the merit of the grievance, and resolve the grievance within a month of receiving the \nnotice for the meeting. Further grievances will be referred by APs to appropriate courts of law. \nThe procedures for redressing grievances are further detailed in the resettlement plan.  \n\n                                                 \n6   LP will be implemented in the four local areas: Babesa, Changbangdu, Lungtenphu, and Simtokha. The number of \nlocal  area  representatives  is  based  on  the  number  of  landowners  in  each  area.  Local  area  representatives  were \nelected by landowners in public meetings conducted during public consultations prior to finalizing local area plans. \n7   The LARC will be composed of a local government representative, the head of the PIU, local area representatives, \n\nand AP representatives (one BPL household, one tenant/leaseholder, and one agricultural worker). \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A11.1: Entitlement Matrix (Impacts from Land Pooling) \n \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nResponsible Agency \n\n \n\n1 \n\nType of \nLoss/ \nApplication \nLoss of \nland/rented \nor leased  \n\nEntitled  \nPerson \n\nTenants  and \nleaseholders \n\n2 \n\nLoss of \nlivelihood \n\nTenant or \nleaseholder \nfarmer, or \nagricultural \nworker/ \nemployees  \n\nAssistance \nto vulnerable \nlandowners \n\nVulnerable \nlandownersa \n\n1.

The  Project  minimizes  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  selection  criteria  for  subcomponents  included  one  for  resettlement  impacts. \nPriority  was  given  to  rehabilitation  on  the  premises  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  and \nconstructing new facilities on Government land. Resettlement impacts will further be minimized \nthrough careful siting and alignment during detailed design. No land acquisition is required for \nComponent  B.  The  Component  will  have  impacts  on  one  commercial  and  four  residential \nstructures owned by the Government, and on a Government plot leased for use as a scrap yard. \nNew residential quarters will be provided to the four affected households, who are employees of \nthe  Royal  Bhutan  Army,  and  affected  leaseholders  and  their  10  employees  are  entitled  to \ncompensation.

Implementation will be closely monitored to \nprovide  the  PMU  with  an  effective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying \npotential difficulties and problems. The PIU will carry out internal monitoring. Job charts will be \nprovided by the social development specialist and indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth.  Monthly  progress  reports  shall  be  prepared  by  the  PIU  and  submitted  to  the  PMU, \nreporting  actual  achievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  their  respective  job  charts  and \nreasons for any shortfalls. The PMU will be responsible for managing the database on affected \npeople and documenting the results of the AP census, information on asset verification, and the \nsocioeconomic  survey  data,  which  will  be  used  as  the  baseline  for  assessing  the  impacts  of \nresettlement  plan  implementation.  The  PMU  will  appoint  an  independent  agency  to  undertake \nexternal  monitoring  of  the  Project  on  a  half-yearly  basis  and  submit  its  reports  directly  to  the \nPMU. The PMU will submit all reports to ADB for review.  \n\n                                                 \n2  The committee will be composed of a local government representative, the head of the PIU, an AP representative, \nand a resident of the community.

The  component  will  entail  the  permanent  acquisition  of \n1.1 hectares of land in Dagana for water and wastewater treatment. Land acquisition will affect \ntwo  households.  Impacts  are  not  anticipated  to  be  significant,  as  the  land  to  be  acquired  is \nvacant  and  not  used  for  productive  purposes.  Resettlement  impacts  will  further  be  minimized \nthrough careful siting and alignment during detailed design.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n2. \nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on (i) the Land Act of \n1979  (amended  in  1991),  (ii)  Land  Compensation  Rate  (1996),1  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). The entitlement matrix for the component, based on the above \npolicies, is given in Table A13.1. \n \nC. \n\nConsultation, Information Dissemination, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\nThe resettlement plan was prepared in consultation with stakeholders. Discussions and \n3. \nmeetings  were  held  involving  stakeholders,  particularly  affected  households  and  beneficiaries, \nand  socioeconomic  information  was  gathered  to  determine  the  potential  impacts  of  land \nacquisition.  Information  has  been,  and  continues  to  be,  disseminated  to  APs  through  various \nmedia. Local-language versions of the summary resettlement plan have been distributed by the \nImplementing Agency and explained to APs. The resettlement plan will also be disclosed on the \nwebsites of the Executing Agency and ADB, and information dissemination and consultation will \ncontinue  throughout  project  implementation.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  based  on \ndetailed design. ADB must review and approve the updated plan prior to the award of civil works \ncontracts, and compensation and/or assistance APs is required prior to the commencement of \ncivil works. The approved updated resettlement plan will be disclosed on the websites of ADB \nand the EA.  \n \n4. \nGrievances of APs will first be brought to the attention of the project implementation unit \n(PIU).  Grievances  not  redressed  by  the  PIU  will  be  brought  to  the  Land  Acquisition  and \nResettlement  Committee,  acting  as  a  grievance  redress  committee.  The  committee  will  be \ncomposed of a local government representative, the head of the PIU, an AP representative, and \na resident of the community. The committee will meet when a grievance is not resolved by the \nPIU. Members will be given notice of the meeting, meet to determine the merit of the grievance, \nand  resolve  the  grievance  within  a  month  of  receiving  the  notice  for  the  meeting.  Further \ngrievances will be referred by APs to appropriate courts of law. \n\n                                                 \n1  Updates of the Land Act provide compensation for urban and rural land, as well as for cash-crop trees when land is \n\nacquired for public purposes. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n     Appendix 13 \n\n \n\nTable 13.1: Entitlement Matrix \n \nCompensation Policy \n\nResponsible Agency \n\nEntitled  \nPerson \n\n \n\nType of \nLoss/ \nApplication \n1  Loss of land \n(vacant plot) \n\nOwner(s) with \nlegal title \n \n \n\n1.

A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established under DUDES to support the Project. A PIU will be \nestablished  in  the  Dagana  Dzongkhag  administration,  manage  day-to-day  operations,  and \nimplement the resettlement plan. A social development specialist for Phuentsoling and Dagana \nat the PMU will coordinate land acquisition and resettlement through the PIU with support from \nthe project management consultant\u2019s resettlement specialist. The estimated resettlement cost is \nNu140,000.2 Resettlement plan implementation (excluding monitoring, which will be undertaken \nthroughout the project period) is expected to be completed within 12 months.  \n \nE. \n \nMonitoring  will  cover  physical  and  financial  components  and  provide  feedback  to  keep \n6. \nresettlement  plan  implementation  on  schedule.  Implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  to \nprovide  the  PMU  with  an  effective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying \npotential difficulties and problems. The PIU will carry out internal monitoring. Job charts will be \nprovided by the social development specialist and indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth.  Monthly  progress  reports  shall  be  prepared  by  the  PIU  and  submitted  to  the  PMU, \nreporting  actual  achievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  their  respective  job  charts  and \nreasons for any shortfalls, if any. The PMU will be responsible for managing the AP database, \ndocumenting results of the AP census, information on asset verification, and the socioeconomic \nsurvey  data,  which  will  be  used  as  the  baseline  for  assessing  impacts  of  resettlement  plan \nimplementation. The PMU will appoint an independent agency to undertake external monitoring \non a half-yearly basis and submit its reports directly to the PMU. The PMU will submit all reports \nto ADB for review. \n\n                                                 \n2 This covers consultation and information dissemination, monitoring and evaluation, and administrative and related \n\ncosts. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 4 September 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "ngultrum (Nu) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Nu1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.02149 \nNu46.52 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nDADM \nDanida \nDMS \nDUDES \nEIRR \nEMP \nEUSPS \nFYP \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nLIB \nLP \nMoCHA \nMoWHS \nNCB \nNEC \nO&M \nOLA \nPCC \nPIU \nPMC \nPMU \nPPMS \nPSC \nSDS \nSOE \nSWM \nTA \nTCC \nUFW \nUIIP \nWSS \nWTP \nWWTP \n", "Asian Development Bank  \nDepartment of Aid and Debt Management \nDanish International Development Aid  \ndesign, monitoring, and supervision \nDepartment of Urban Development and Engineering Services \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental monitoring plan \nenvironment and urban sector program support \n5 year plan \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination  \nlimited international bidding \nland pooling \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Culture and Home Affairs \n\u2013  Ministry of Works and Human Settlement \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national competitive bidding \nNational Environment Commission \noperation and maintenance \nOffice of Legal Affairs \nPhuentsholing City Corporation \nproject implementation unit \nproject management consultant \nproject management unit \nProject Performance Management System \nproject steering committee \nsocial development specialist \nstatement of expenditure \nsolid waste management \ntechnical assistance \nThimphu City Corporation \nunaccounted-for water \nUrban Infrastructure Improvement Project \nwater supply and sanitation \nwater treatment plant \nwastewater treatment plant \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n", "dzongkhag \ndungkhag \ndzongda \ngeog \nthrompon \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "district or province \nsubdistrict \ndistrict administrator \ncounty \nMayor \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June.
