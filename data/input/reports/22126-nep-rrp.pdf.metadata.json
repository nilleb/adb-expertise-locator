I submit to the Board of Directors, for its consideration and\ndecision, the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan from\nthe Special Funds resources of the Bank in an amount in various currencies\nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights Twelve Million One Hundred Fifty-\nTwo Thousand ($16 . 62 million equivalent) applied for by the Kingdom of\nNepal for the Rajapur Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The loan will\nhave a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years and a\nservice charge of 1 per cent per annum. The Government has also requested\na technical assistance grant, in an amount of $650,000 from the Bank's\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund, for institutional strengthening of\nfarmers' associations.\n2. The Government attaches high priority to the Project, which is\nalso supported by all major donors to the irrigation subsector in Nepal.\nIn December 1988 the Bank approved a project preparatory technical\nassistance ]/ to undertake a feasibility study of the proposed Project.\nThe consultants stayed in the Project area for nearly six months and\nconsulted/interacted with the farmers intensively, and incorporated their\nfelt needs and preferences in their report. The study was completed in\nSeptember 1990 and confirmed the viability of the Project. A special task\nforce of the Department of Irrigation visited the Project area in December\n1990 to discuss the recommendations of the consultants with the farmers.\nA Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal in January/February 1991 and had\nfurther consultations with the farmers on the design and scope of the\nProject. Subsequently, an Appraisal Mission visited Nepal during April\n1991 and confirmed that the Project was consistent with the Government's\nsectoral objectives and policies, and also in accordance with the Bank's\noperational strategy for Nepal, and was thus suitable for Bank financing.\nFormal loan negotiations with authorized representatives of the Government\nand Executing Agency were held in Manila on 1 October 1991. If approved,\nthe loan will be the sixty-eighth to the Kingdom of Nepal, and the twelfth\nto the irrigation subsector.\nI. THE ECONOMY\n3. A Board Information Paper entitled \"Nepal: Economic Review and\nBank Operations\" (EBO:NEP 91012) was circulated to the Board on 1 August\n1991.\t (DOG. IN. 152-91)\n1/ TA No. 1O98-NEP(SF), approved on 29 December 1988 in an amount of\n$456,000.", "A. Agriculture Sector\n1. Overview\n4. Nepal's economy is predominantly agricultural. Agriculture\ncontributes about 54 per cent to the gross domestic product; employs about\n91 per cent of the economically active population, most of whom are\nextremely poor; and provides for over 60 per cent of the exports of the\ncountry. Even the country's nascent industrial sector is heavily\ndependent on agriculture for both the supply of raw materials and markets\nfor finished industrial products. With about 93 per cent of the\npopulation living in rural areas and depending largely on agriculture,\nagriculture exercises an all-pervading effect on the socioeconomic life\nof the people in Nepal. Because of the overwhelming weight of agriculture\nin the national economy, substantial improvements in the people's life,\nincluding the satisfaction of their basic needs, will be possible only\nwith a significant improvement in this sector. It is, in short, the\nagriculture sector that sets the pace for growth in the economy.\n5. Nepal is a rugged and mountainous country with very limited\nnatural resources. Of its total land area (14.7 million ha) only about\n18 per cent (2.6 million ha) is under cultivation; of this, just about one\nthird has irrigation facilities. Because of Nepal's extremely difficult\ntopography, significant regional variations exist in agricultural output.\nOf the total cultivated area 49 per cent is in the Terai, with the\nremainder in the Hills. The majority of the country's agricultural\npopulation consist of small- to medium-scale farmers working on farms of\n0.25 ha to 2.0 ha in size. Paddy is the main foodgrain grown on more than\nhalf of the cultivated area. Other major foodgrains are maize, wheat,\nbarley and millet. Major cash crops are sugarcane, potato, pulses,\noilseeds, jute and tobacco. The very modest 2.4 per cent of overall\nannual growth rate of agricultural production, over the period FY1975 to\nFY1990, is a cause of great concern. In fact, considering population grew\nover the same period at the rate of 2.6 per cent per annum, this implies\na declining per capita food availability. Although in some areas yields\nincreased as a result of the provision of new or improved irrigation\nfacilities and improved agricultural support services, average crop yields\noverall either declined or stagnated over this period. Cropping\nintensities remained low, at about 125 per cent. The main reasons for the\nlow yields are that (i) irrigation covers only about 30 per cent of the\ncultivated area; (ii) chemical fertilizer use is low at 14 kg/ha; (iii)\nagricultural support services are generally inadequate; and (iv) soil\nfertility is declining because of erosion, particularly in the Hills. As\nthe cultivable land cannot be expanded, there is an urgent need to\nincrease the productivity of existing land (especially in the Terai)\nthrough improved irrigation facilities and availability of modern\nagricultural inputs (such as pesticides, improved seeds, chemical\nfertilizers, and credit). Within this framework, the intensification of\nagriculture by fuller exploitation of existing irrigation facilities is\nparticularly attractive in view of its cost effectiveness and quick\nreturns.", "'I\n2. Irrigation Subsector\n6. Given the high population growth and modest gains achieved so far\nin agricultural production, the enhancement of irrigation facilities as\na means to raising agriculture productivity represents one of the best\nopportunities and, therefore, a top priority in the Government's strategy\nfor development. Government agencies have been involved from the mid-\nl960s in the construction, management and enhancement of irrigation\nschemes and in assisting farmers to construct and/or rehabilitate private\nfarmer-managed irrigation schemes (FMISs), and gains have been made. The\nmain role has been played by the Department of Irrigation (DOl), which has\nconstructed medium- and large-sized irrigation facilities. The\nAgricultural Development Bank of Nepal, has been involved in promoting and\nfinancing, through its agricultural credit operations, the development of\nshallow tubewells and small (usually less than 50 ha) surface irrigation\nschemes.\n7. At present, about 933,000 ha or 31 per cent of the net cultivated\narea has some kind of irrigation facilities. Of these, only about 28 per\ncent (covering around 265,000 ha) are DOl-managed facilities, while the\nrest (about 668,000 ha) are farmer-managed. Because of the technical\ncomplexity and high cost of irrigation facilities, external assistance to\nthe irrigation subsector in the past two decades (which amounted to over\n$400 million) was mainly directed at the medium- and large-scale schemes\nmanaged by DOl. To date, DOI has constructed 210 irrigation projects (10\nlarge- and 200 medium-scale projects). The performance of these projects,\nhowever, has not been fully satisfactory. Of the total net command area\nof about 265,000 ha, it is estimated that only 60 per cent receives\nreliable supplementary irrigation during the wet season and 21 per cent\nduring the dry season. Major factors contributing to this low performance\nare: (i) poor operation and maintenance (O&M) partly due to insufficiency\nof funds; (ii) inadequate project management and lack of farmer\nparticipation in water management; and (iii) low level of agricultural\nsupport services.\n8. The FMISs have a better performance record, although the\ntechnical problems they are incurring call for some Government\nintervention. Of crucial importance is that farmers mobilize their own\nresources for O&M without expecting any support from Government agencies.\nIn so doing, farmers have developed a proprietary interest in the\nirrigation scheme, which implies two main advantages: (i) continuous\nmaintenance of the facilities by the farmers themselves, and (ii) the\nabsence of any burden on the Government's budget.\n9. Although promising, these schemes face increasing problems, which\nhave undermined their reliability. Since FMISs are a result of joint\nplanning, design, construction and management efforts of farmer\ngroups/communities, technologies and materials used for the construction\nand maintenance are generally simple and cheap, reflecting the limited\ntechnical expertise and resources of the farmers. As a result, the canal", "4\nsystems are rudimentary, lack permanent structures and need constant\nmaintenance and tedious rehabilitation after each major flood.\nMobilization of free labor, which makes up the bulk of the required\nresources, has also become increasingly difficult as many farmers take up\njobs during the agricultural slack period. In addition, timber and\nbrushwood from the forests, used for the construction and repair of the\nirrigation structures, have become increasingly scarce as a result of\ndeforestation of the nearby catchment areas.\n10. In these circumstances, although the main thrust of FMISs remains\nvalid, there is scope for improving them through the provision of\npermanent, properly designed structures, distribution systems and cross\ndrainage. This, in turn, could expand their command areas and reduce 0&M\ncosts to a manageable level. It is important, however, in designing the\nprojects that Government intervention be conceived as a special action\naimed at providing capital and technical assistance to the schemes without\naltering their management and farmer-owned features, which represent in\nfact their main strength.\nB. Government Strategies and Programs for the Irrigation Subsector\n11. In recognition of the potential of FMISs to help increase\nagricultural production, the Government in August 1988 provided guidelines\nin the New Working Policy on Irrigation Develo pment for its assistance to\nsuch schemes. The main features of the new policy are: (i) participation\nof farmer beneficiaries in the identification, design, construction and\n0&M of new irrigation facilities; and (ii) sharing of construction costs\nbetween the Government and the farmer beneficiaries. In support of this\npolicy, the Bank approved an Irrigation Sector Loan j/ for construction\nand rehabilitation of small-and medium-sized FMISs. In view of the\ninstitutional capacity of FMISs to take full responsibility for 0&M, the\nrehabilitation of such FMISs is considered one of the most cost-effective\ninvestments in irrigation development. The provision of permanent\nstructures will lead to a more reliable and equitable water distribution\nsystem and will reduce the need to mobilize large amounts of labor. In\naddition, the replacement of timber and brushwood structures will reduce\ndependency on forest products and the progressive deforestation of the\nwatershed.\nC.\t External Assistance to the Irrigation Subsector\n12. Among the external aid agencies, the Bank and the World Bank have\nbeen the major sources of assistance to the irrigation subsector. The\nWorld Bank has provided 11 loans for a total of $ 252.0 million. Other\nexternal donors in the subsector are European Economic Community, India,\nJapan, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, United Nations Children's Fund and\n1/\t Loan No. 923-NEP(SF) approved 22 November 1988 in the amount of $36.3\nmillion.", "5\nUnited States.\t An illustrative list of external assistance to the\nirrigation sector is provided in the Appendix.\nD. Bank Assistance to the Irrigation Subsector\n13. Since 1971, the Bank has provided 11 loans to finance seven\nirrigation projects in Nepal amounting to a total of $136.3 million. The\nProject Performance Audit Report for the Kankai Irrigation Project was\nprepared in August 1988. The report concluded that the Project had\ngenerally achieved its physical targets though incurring considerable time\nand cost overruns. Project Completion Reports have been circulated to the\nBoard for the Chitwan Valley Development Project, the First Hill\nIrrigation Project and the Command Area Development Project, completed in\n1988, 1989 and 1990 respectively. The Chitwan Valley Development Project\nwas affected by major technical problems during its implementation and was\nunsuccessful. The other two projects were generally successful, although\ndelays were experienced in their implementation.\nII. BANK OPERATIONS IN NEPAL\n14. A Board Information Paper \"Nepal: Economic Review and Bank\nOperations\" (EBO:NEP 91012) was circulated to the Board on 1 August 1991.\n(DOC. IN.152-91)\nOperational Strategy\n15. The Bank's operational strategy for Nepal essentially calls for\nthe Bank to concentrate its efforts in four areas, namely: (i) seeking\ngrowth in agriculture through improvements in agricultural productivity;\n(ii) containment of ecological factors threatening the future productivity\nof agriculture (principally through environmental protection measures,\nincluding reforestation, watershed protection and mitigation of soil\nerosion); (iii) enhancement of industrial development, in particular\nthrough increased private sector involvement; and (iv) development of\nsupporting physical and social infrastructure. In conjunction with\nconcentrating lending activities in these areas, the strategy also calls\nfor the Bank to support efforts at institution building as well as sector\nwork on selected institutions and key policies. In addition, it calls for\nthe Bank to give priority towards alleviating binding constraints and\ncritical bottlenecks to development and meeting basic needs.\n16. Since Nepal is highly dependent on agriculture, support for\nagricultural development is a prominent feature of the Bank's operational\nstrategy in Nepal. The Bank's efforts in the sector have been mainly\ndirected at enhancing food production and diversification in cash crops,\nhorticulture and animal husbandry. This entails intensification of\nagriculture (thereby leading to improvements in productivity) in the Terai\nand selected Hill areas by fuller exploitation of existing irrigation\nfacilities, selective expansion of irrigation, improving the effectiveness", "6\nof support services and ensuring the availability of key inputs including\nresearch, extension, credit and fertilizer. The Bank's operational\nstrategy for Nepal recognizes the need for direct assistance to alleviate\npoverty, especially among the rural poor. The proposed Project, being\ndirected as it is towards the enhancement of irrigation facilities,\nsmallholder agriculture development and poverty alleviation, is therefore\nconsistent with the Bank's country and sectoral strategy. In particular,\nthe proposed Project is essentially a continuation of the Bank's\ninvolvement in FMISs under the ongoing Irrigation Sector Loan for small-\nand medium-sized schemes.\nIII. THE PROJECT\n17. A Report entitled \"Appraisal of the Rajapur Irrigation\nRehabilitation Project\" (Report No. LAP:NEP 22126) is circulated herewith.\nA.\t Objectives. Scope and Description\n18. The main objective of the proposed Project is to bring\nsustainable development to the Project area. This is to be achieved\nthrough (1) increasing agricultural production and farm incomes through\nirrigation improvement, (ii) arresting the loss of irrigated land caused\nby river capture and river bank erosion, (iii) reducing environmental\ndegradation through a reduction of farmers' reliance on forest products\nfor the repair of their irrigation system, and (iv) strengthening the\ninstitutional base and technical capabilities of the existing farmer\nassociations. In view of its location in an economically depressed area\nof Nepal, the Project will also address the issue of poverty alleviation\nfor the farmers.\n19. Under the Project, six existing irrigation systems will be\nrehabilitated, improved and consolidated in one scheme. In particular,\nthe Project comprises: (i) replacement of the temporary intake for the\nBudi Kulo irrigation system by an ungated permanent structure capable of\nrestricting the discharge into the system at high flood levels; the\nremaining five intakes will be closed and their irrigation system will be\nconnected to the Budi Kulo main canal, concentrating future maintenance\non one location only, (ii) replacement of the brushwood and boulder weirs\nwith three concrete weirs to ensure reliable irrigation supplies to the\nbranch canals, (iii) improvement of the branch canal structures to ensure\ndelivery of irrigation supplies to the village canals, (iv) upgrading of\n37.5 km of service roads to improve farmers' access to major market\ncenters and to facilitate O&M of the irrigation facilities, and (v)\nconsultant services for Project implementation to assist in the\npreparation of tender documents and in construction design and\nsupervision. In addition, an advisory technical assistance will be\nprovided to strengthen the existing farmer associations and to facilitate\ntheir active participation in the Project.", "7\nB. Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements\n20. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $20.72 million\nequivalent, of which $10.43 million (50 per cent) represents direct and\nindirect foreign exchange costs. The local currency costs, including\ntaxes and duties, amount to $10.29 million equivalent. The cost estimates\ninclude provision for physical contingencies and price escalation.\n21. It is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of $16.62 million\nfrom its Special Funds resources on standard ADF terms to finance the\nentire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost ($6.19\nmillion equivalent). Overall, the Bank would finance about 80 per cent of\nthe total cost of the Project. The rest of the resources required for the\nProject will be contributed by the Government (11 per cent) and the\nparticipating farmers (9 per cent). In providing financing for local\ncost, it is relevant to note that the country is making significant\nefforts to mobilize domestic resources and to generate savings to support\nits development efforts. However, the financial requirements of its\ndevelopment program are straining available resources as reflected in the\ncountry's continuing saving-investment gap and precarious balance of\npayments position.\nC. Executing Agency\n22. The DOl under the Ministry of Water Resources will be the\nExecuting Agency for the Project. DOl is familiar with the concept of\nfarmer participation in the implementation of irrigation projects and is\napplying this concept in the ongoing Bank-financed Irrigation Sector\nProject (para. 11) and the World Bank-financed Irrigation Line of Credit\nProject for small- and medium-sized projects. On the basis of this\nperformance, DOI is considered capable of and committed to implementing\nthe Project through the concept of farmers' participation.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n23. DOI will appoint a Project Manager and provide a core of key\nstaff who are familiar with the various aspects of farmer participation\nin the construction of irrigation projects. The Project Manager will be\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the Project and will reside\nin the Project office in Rajapur. The Regional Director of the Mid-\nWestern Irrigation Directorate will be designated the Project Director.\nHe will be responsible for liaison and coordination between the Project\nand the DOI head office in Kathniandu and will have decision-making\nauthority on most technical and financial matters on behalf of DOI.\nDuring the construction season, he will visit the Project site/area at\nleast once a month to monitor and discuss with the Project Manager the\nprogress of Project implementation. Moreover, DOI will establish a\nProject Management Committee (PMC) in which it will share responsibility\nfor Project implementation with a majority representation of the farmers.\nThe Project Manager will be the Chairman of the PMC, and his deputy will", "8\nbe the PMC Secretary. The Vice-Chairman of the PMC will be the elected\nhead of the Executive Committee (Central Farmers Committee or CFC) of the\nnew Central Farmers Association (CFA, see para. 24). A district\nirrigation engineer and not more than seven members of the CFC will serve\nas PMC members. The PMC will serve as an active foruw for DOl officials\nand farmers to reach a consensus on selected Project matters, and to\nexchange information on all other Project matters.\n24. Additionally, to ensure the farmers' effective involvement in\nProject implementation, DOl is assisting them to establish a new CFA and\nits executive committee (the CFC). DOl will also assist in registering\nthe CFA under the Association Registration Act 2034 in order to formalize\nfarmers' decisions and agreement with DOl on the following matters: (1)\nacceptability of the general scope of works; (ii) future allocation of the\nirrigation flow in the main canal among the branch canals; (iii)\norganization and resource mobilization (labor and cash) for the O&M; and\n(iv) farmers' commitment regarding their contribution to the construction\ncosts (labor and/or cash).\nE.\t Procurement\n25. Civil works to be financed by the Bank will be undertaken in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Main civil works\n(intake structures, weirs and associated offtake, flood embankment,\nconnecting canals, feeder road) will be undertaken on the basis of\ninternational competitive bidding. The remaining civil works (improvement\nof branch canals and village roads, construction of buildings), which will\nbe simple and dispersed widely over the Project area, will be carried out\nunder either local competitive bidding, force account, petty contracts or\nvolunteer labor.\nF.\t Consultant Services for Project Implementation\n26. About 39 man-months of foreign and 77 man-months of local\nconsultant services will be required in the following fields: (i)\nirrigation design and planning; (ii) construction management; (iii)\nirrigation system design; (iv) road design; (v) river hydraulics; and (vi)\nothers. Foreign consultant services are required to complement the\nservices of the local consultants in those fields for which local\nexpertise is limited (planning, construction management and river\nhydraulics). The consultants will be recruited in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nC. Accounts. Audits and Reports\n27. The DOl will establish and maintain separate Project accounts for\nexpenditures on the goods and services to be financed out of the loan\nproceeds. Accounts will be audited annually by the Auditor General of the\nBorrower, and copies of audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within\n12 months after the end of each fiscal year. DOl will also submit to the\nBank (i) trimester progress reports on the status of Project", "9\nimplementation within two months after the period concerned, (ii) annual\nplanning reports including a brief assessment of the physical and\nfinancial status of Project implementation for the year, and a detailed\nimplementation schedule and summary of the budget allocation to be made\nfor the Project for the subsequent year, (iii) a Project Completion Report\nwithin three months of the completion of the Project, and (iv) annual\ninspection reports after completion of the Project, within three months\nafter the end of the fiscal year, including a detailed assessment of the\nirrigation system performance as well as recommendations and measures\nproposed to improve its 0&M.\nH. Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n28. A socioeconomic benchmark survey was prepared by local\nconsultants during the feasibility study for the Project in March 1990.\nThe survey will be updated by DOl towards completion of the Project. To\nmonitor economic and technical performance after Project completion, the\nCFC will keep records of irrigation and agricultural operations and\nsystems performance. DOl will carry out a detailed annual assessment of\nthe irrigation system's performance. A report on these findings, together\nwith recommendations for possible improvements in O&M and possible\nselective assistance by DOl, will be submitted to and discussed with the\nCFA. A copy of the report will be submitted to the Bank for information.\nI. Operation and Maintenance\n29.\t Upon completion of the works, the Central Farmers Association\n(CFA) will assume the full 0&M responsibility, except for emergency\nrepairs that are beyond its capability to execute.\t In the latter\nsituation, DOl will carry out the repairs under the same cost-sharing\narrangements as applied for the construction of the Project. The\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) will take over the responsibility for the O&M\nof the East-West Feeder road after its completion while the farmers will\nbe responsible for 0&M of the North-South Service Road. After completion\nof the Project, the district DOl staff will remain associated with the\nProject in an advisory function to CFA. The district irrigation engineer\ntogether with representatives of the CFA will carry out quarterly\ninspections of the Project. If during such inspection 0&M deficiencies\nare observed, DOl will direct the CFA to remedy them and will provide\ntechnical expertise if required.\nJ.\t Implementation Schedule\n30. The Project will be implemented over a period of six years,\nexpected to begin in early 1992 and terminating at the end of 1997.\nConstruction works will be carried out over a period of four years.\nK. Environmental Impact\n31.\t The replacement of the existing temporary wooden structures of\nthe irrigation facilities by permanent ones will have a positive", "10\nenvironmental impact as it will save about 20,000 cubic meters of wood\nannually, which is equal to the preservation of 400 ha of mixed forest in\nNepal annually. The economic value of these benefits can be estimated at\n$240,000 per annum.\n32. Closing of the five existing intakes and of selected river\nchannels will reduce the risk of river and canal bank erosion and river\ncapture of farmland by uncontrolled floods. On the basis of historic\ndata, it is estimated that about 20 ha. of farmland will be saved annually\nby the Project. In addition, other non-quantified environmental benefits\nwill arise, as the preservation of forests will result in a reduction of\nsoil erosion, which causes downstream siltation and loss of soil\nfertility.\nL.\t Project Justification and Benefits\n33. The quantifiable agricultural benefits of the Project consists\nmainly of (i) a modest increase in irrigated area of about 1,000 ha, (ii)\nimproved yields arising from enhanced water availability, particularly\nduring the monsoon period, of about 20 per cent on average, and (iii) an\nincrease in cropping intensity arising from the earlier availability of\nwater supply from 180 per cent to 219 per cent. At full development the\nannual incremental production resulting from the Project is estimated at\n$4.7 million at 1991 constant prices. The Project will also reduce the 0&M\nrequirements of the irrigation system through the replacement of\nmaintenance-intensive temporary structures by durable masonry and concrete\nones; and through construction of one common intake structure, thus\nconcentrating future maintenance efforts on one intake and one approach\nchannel instead of the existing six. The economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project has\nbeen estimated at 18.1 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively. If the\nestimated value of environmental benefits is taken into consideration, the\nEIRR goes up to 18.8 per cent.\n34. In addition, the Project is expected to contribute to poverty\nalleviation for the 4,300 farm households and some 3,000 landless farm\nfamilies (Kamaiyas) living in the Project area. Under the Project, the\nannual farm income of a typical farm household will increase from NRs\n14,970 ($350) without the Project to NRs 37,360 ($875). The annual income\nof a typical Kamaia family will increase from NRs 12,970 ($ 304) to NRs\n20,840 ($488). On the basis of the distribution of farm sizes, it is\nestimated that the proportion of people living below the poverty line (NRs\n3,100) in the Project area will decrease from 80 per cent to 20 per cent.\nM.\t Project Risks\n35. The major risk associated with the Project is that farmers may\nnot be willing to continue with O&M as a result of the inability of the\nProject to fulfill their requirements because of lack of their\nparticipation in Project preparation and implementation. To ensure that", "11\nthe proposed Project reflects farmers t felt needs, they were consulted on\nthe required scope of the rehabilitation works during the feasibility\nstudy, during the Government's consultation visit to the Project area and\nduring the Bank's Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions. To maintain farmer\nparticipation and involvement during the further stages of Project\nimplementation, the existing farmer organizations will be incorporated in\nthe Project organization and will have joint responsibility for\nimplementation, together with DOl, through their representation in the\nProject Management Committee. To enhance farmers' institutional and\ntechnical capabilities, advisory technical assistance will be provided in\nparallel with the Project (see para. 40).\nN.\t Policy Aspects\n1. Farmers' Participation\n36. Lack of farmers participation in water management was the main\nreason of the low performance of irrigation projects in Nepal. The\nproposed Project has addressed directly this issue by seeking farmers\nparticipation since the early stage of Project preparation and later\nduring design and implementation. The aim of this strategy is to develop\namong the farmers a sense of ownership of the irrigation facilities. In\nthe feasibility study stage, farmers were already consulted on the\nmagnitude of assistance needed, and the proposed Project fully reflects\ntheir requirements. Participation of the farmers in Project\nimplementation has been institutionalized, and major decision-making\nauthority on crucial design and implementation issues has been assigned\nto them to ensure that the final Project continues to reflect and meet\ntheir requirements.\n37. To enhance the participation of farmers, they are expected to\ncontribute towards the construction costs of the subprojects, partly in\ncash and mostly in the form of labor. The Government has agreed that\ntotal farmers' contribution to the irrigation component of the Project\nshould be in accordance with the cost-sharing arrangements presently\napplied for the rehabilitation of small- and medium-scale FMISs. For a\ntotal Project area of 13,000 ha, the per hectare development cost for\nirrigation amounts to NRs 32,200 ($754). On the basis of these unit\ncosts, the farmers' contribution will be NRs 3,000 per ha (about 9.3 per\ncent of the construction cost), to be paid in cash or in kind or a\ncombination thereof. The Government has emphasized that enhanced farmer\nparticipation will remain an essential policy aim in the irrigation\nsubsector.\n2. Cost Recovery\n38. In the past, Water User Organizations have been able to\neffectively collect contributions from farmers participating in FMISs to\nmeet O&M costs. One of the most important concerns of the Bank has been\nto retain this tradition by reinforcing the institutional capabilities of", "12\nthe farmer associations in charge of collecting fees and managing the\nnecessary repairs to the schemes. The achievement of complete autonomy\nby the farmer associations in implementing and financing 0&M works is one\nof the main aims of the Project. In accordance with the principle of\nleaving the management of the irrigation facilities to the farmers, the\nCFA will be responsible for providing an adequate plan of cost recovery\nfor 0&M works before the start of construction works.\n0.\t Specific Assurances\n39.\t In addition to the standard covenants, the Government has given\nthe following specific assurances to the Bank:\n(i) Project Concept. The Government will ensure that the\nfollowing policies are observed in the construction and\nrehabilitation of Project facilities: (a) participation of\nfarmer beneficiaries in the identification, design,\nconstruction, and O&M of new irrigation facilities; and (b)\nsharing of construction cost between the Government and the\nfarmer beneficiaries;\n(ii) Joint Project Management Committee. The Government will\nensure that a joint PMC will be established in which the\nresponsibility for Project implementation will be shared with\nrepresentatives of concerned farmers in the Project area;\n(iii) Farmers' Contribution to Construction Cost. The Government\nwill ensure that beneficiary farmers contribute to the\nconstruction cost in accordance with the cost-sharing\narrangements applied for the rehabilitation of small- and\nmedium- scale FMISs;\n(iv) Central Farmers Association. The Government will ensure that\nall necessary actions will be taken to assist the existing\nFMISs to establish or constitute themselves into a unified\norganization, the new CFA. Registration of the CFA under the\nAssociation Registration Act, 2034 will be a condition for\nloan effectiveness;\n(v) Agreement Between DOl and CFA. The Government will ensure\nthat, prior to the commencement of Project preparatory\nactivities, a written agreement between the Executing Agency\nand the CFA has been executed covering the following subjects:\n(i) acceptability by the farmers of the broad scope of the\nProject; (ii) future allocation of the irrigation flow in the\nBudi Kulo main canal to the branch canals in the Project area;\n(iii) draft organizational setup and resource mobilization\n(labor and cash) for 0&M of the new irrigation facilities,\nincluding the annual excavation of the approach canal; (iv)\nfarmers' preparedness to participate actively in Project", "13\nimplementation and to contribute their share to the\nconstruction cost in labor and/or cash; and (v) procedures\nfor handing over and subsequent O&M of the completed\nirrigation facilities;\n(vi) Operation and Maintenance. The Government will ensure that,\nupon completion and handing over of the works, the CFA will\nassume full O&M responsibility for the irrigation facilities.\nIn case of emergencies requiring repairs beyond the\ncapabilities of the CFA, the repairs will be carried out by\nthe Executing Agency in accordance with the same cost-sharing\narrangements as applied for the construction of the works.\nAfter completion of the Project, the Executing Agency will\ncarry out quarterly inspections of the irrigation facilities\nand provide the necessary assistance if deemed so as a result\nof the inspections;\n(vii) Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. The Government\nwill ensure that, after completion of the Project, the\nExecuting Agency will carry out annual inspections of the\nirrigation system's performance and that the CFC will keep\nrecords of irrigation and agricultural operations and system\nperformance to monitor the economic and technical performance\nof Project facilities;\n(viii) Environmental Impact. To safeguard against any possible\nadverse effect on the environment, the Government will ensure\nthat, in the implementation of the Project, the Bank's\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Irrigation Projects. Land\nClearance and Watershed Development will be observed; and\n(ix) Agricultural Support Services. The Government will ensure\nthat the farmers in the Project area will have timely access\nto the necessary agricultural support services and credit to\nenable them to take full advantage of the increased potential\nfor crop production as a result of the facilities to be\nimproved under the Project.\nP. Technical Assistance\n40. The Government has requested the Bank to finance an advisory\ntechnical assistance to assist in establishing the institutional base for\nfarmers' effective participation in Project implementation, and to\nstrengthen the institutional base and technical capabilities of the\nfarmers' organizations to continue 06CM after Project completion. It is\nenvisaged that about 12 man-months of the services of international\nconsultants in the field of institutional development/community irrigation\ndevelopment will be needed. In addition, about 100 man-months of domestic\nconsultant\t services\t will\t be\t required\t for\t institutional\ndevelopment/administration and rural sociology/community irrigation", "14\ndevelopment.\t The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The total cost of the\ntechnical assistance is estimated to be $750,000, of which $250,000 is the\nforeign exchange cost. It is proposed that the Bank finance the entire\nforeign exchange cost and a part of the local currency cost, for a total\namount of $650,000, from the Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund.\nThe Government will provide the remaining local currency cost from its own\nfunds.\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n41. The draft Loan Agreement (Special Operations) between the Kingdom\nof Nepal and the Bank is circulated herewith.\n42. The provisions of the Bank's Special Operations Loan Regulations\ndated 7 December 1982 are incorporated in the draft Loan Agreement.\n43. The Kingdom of Nepal is empowered under its laws to borrow from\nthe Bank, and the Department of Irrigation is authorized to implement the\nProject.\n44. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the\nArticles of Agreement of the Bank.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\n45. I recommend that the Board approve the proposed loan to the\nKingdom of Nepal for the Rajapur Irrigation Rehabilitation Project in an\namount in various currencies equivalent to Twelve Million One Hundred\nFifty-Two Thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR 12.152 million) with a\nservice charge at the rate of one per cent (1%) per annum and carrying\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Agreement presented to the Board.\n46. I also recommend that the Board approve the proposed technical\nassistance to the Government of Nepal for institutional support for\nProject implementation in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$650,000 to be financed on a grant basis from the Bank's Technical\nAssistance Special Fund.\nKIMIMASA TARUMIZU\nPresident\n8 October 1991", "15\nAPPENDIX\nMAJOR IRRIGATION PROJECTS FINANCED BY EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE\nFYi 981-FYi 991\nFINANCING\t EOMMAND 'LOAN AMT.\t YEAR\nSOURCE a!\t _____ PROJECT\t PROJECT b!\t jmiIIion)\t APPROVED\nADB\t Hill Irrigation\t SIS\t 3200\t 11.7\t 1981\nADB\t Command Area Development\t CAD\t 19900\t 13.5\t 1981\nADB\t Second Hill Irrigation\t SIS\t 4,000\t 20.0\t 1982\nJapan\t Irrigation Equipment\t Various\t 4.2\t 1983 & 1984\nIDA\t Bhairawa Lumbini II\t TW\t 8,700\t 16.0\t 1983\nIDA/Switzerland Narayani III Irrigation\t SIS\t 37,400 c/\t 24.5\t 1986\nUNDP\t Irrigation Planning & Design\t Institutional\nStrengthening DOl\t Strengthening\t NA d/\t 2.7\t 1986\nUSAID\t Irrigation Management DOI\t Institutional\nStrengthening\t NA d/\t 6.7\t 1986\nSFD\t Bagmati Irrigation\t SIS\t 22,500\t 8.0\t 1987\nIDA\t Sunsari Morang II\t CAD\t 16,700\t 40.0\t 1987\nADB\t East Rapti\t SIS\t 9,500\t 30.4\t 1987\nADB\t Irrigation Sector Project\t CAD\t 25,000\t 36.3\t 1988\nIDA\t Mahakali Stage II\t SIS/TW\t 6,800\t 41.3\t 1988\nIDA\t Bhairawa Lumbini Ill\t SIS/TW\t 11,200\t 47.2,\t 1991\na!
