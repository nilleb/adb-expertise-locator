FSP  II  and  the  International  Development\nAssociation\u2019s  (IDA)  Financial  Sector  Adjustment  Credit  (FSAC)\njointly  support \nthe  Government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform\nProgram (FSRP), the umbrella program.\n\nfor \n\nMongolia\u2019s  impaired  financial  system  is  potentially  the  most\nsignificant  constraint  to  achieving  stable  economic  growth  and\nthe  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  objectives,\nincluding  poverty  reduction.  In  view  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  the\neconomy  to  supply-side  shocks  as  experienced  in  1994,  1996,\nand  1998,  and  the  concomitant  effects  on  the  banking  system,\nthe development of a sound, stable, and resilient financial system\nis imperative to avoid disruptions from protracted banking  crises\nand improve financial intermediation. These disruptions have led\nto  decreasing  confidence  in  the  banking  system,  as  banks\ninsolvent  and  domestic  savings  were  wiped  out.\nbecame \nIncreases \nintermediation  spreads  and  higher  bank\nrestructuring  costs  have  added  to  fiscal  pressures  and  eroded\nmacroeconomic stabilization.\n\nin \n\nSince  1996,  the  Government  has  accelerated  financial  sector\nreforms  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Program  loan  (FSP),\nwhich  was  satisfactorily  implemented  by  June  1999.  Notably,\nfrom  mid-1998  the  pace  of  banking    reforms  accelerated,  and\nbold  measures  were  introduced.  Commercial  banks\u2019  prudential\nregulations  were  strengthened,  eight  insolvent  banks  were\nclosed, bank  licensing  requirements  were  made  more  stringent,\nbank  exit  policies  were  tightened,  and  loan  recovery  became  a\npriority. \na\ncomprehensive financial sector strategy that provides a long-term\nvision  and  medium-term  strategy  for  the  development  of  the\nsector.  This  strategy  was  unanimously  supported  at  a  financial\nsector coordination of external financers meeting in Ulaanbaataar\nin February 2000.\n\nthe  Government \n\nSubsequently, \n\nadopted \n\nthe  objective  of  strengthening \n\nThe  FSRP  will  build  on  these  reforms  to  improve  banking\ngovernance  with \nfinancial\nintermediation. The FSRP also aims to achieve a more balanced\nfinancial\nfinancial \nintermediaries,  capital  markets,  and  contractual  savings\ninstitutions.  The  FSP  II  supports  these  reforms.  In  addition,  the\n\ndeveloping \n\nstructure \n\nnonbank \n\nby \n\n\fiii\n\nFSP  II  will  address  legal  and  regulatory  deficiencies  in  the\nnonbank  financial  sector  and  capital  markets,  including  the\npension and insurance systems. These reforms are expected to\npromote the  medium-term goal  of  enhancing  domestic  resource\nmobilization, including  long-term  sources of  investment  funds to\ncomplement  the  lending  channels  intermediated  through  the\nbanking system and improve efficiency in resource allocation.\n\nThe  FSP  II  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a\nbalanced,  competitive,  and  market-based \nfinancial  system\naccording to its long-term vision for financial sector development\nand its medium-term strategy to achieve this vision. The FSP II is\nclassified as pro-poor growth, as without these reforms domestic\nresource  mobilization  and  thus  investment  will  be  constrained,\nresulting  in  lower  employment  and  income.  It  will  focus  on\nimproving financial sector governance and contribute to reducing\npoverty.\n\nThe objective  of  the  FSP  II  is  to  promote  the  development  of  a\ncompetitive, stable, and broad-based financial system in order to\nintermediation,  enhance  domestic  and\nstrengthen \nexternal \nresource  mobilization,  and  support  sustainable\neconomic growth.\n\nfinancial \n\nfinancial \n\nThe  FSP  II  will  focus  on  (i)  fostering  improved  governance  and\noperations in the banking system, (ii) developing marketable loan\ncollateral,  (iii)  promoting  the  development  of  the  interbank\nmarket, (iv) enhancing the regulatory and supervisory framework\nthe\ninstitutions, \nfor  nonbank \noperational  and  regulatory  capacity  of  the  Mongolian  Securities\nlegal\nExchange  Commission \ninfrastructure \nthe\nsecurities  markets,  (vii) supporting  the  transformation  from  an\nunfunded to a partially funded pension system, (viii) building the\ncapacity  of  Social  Security  Insurance  General  Office  (SSIGO),\nand  (ix) strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\ninsurance sector development.\n\nto  create  a  conducive  environment \n\n(v)  strengthening \n\n(vi) developing \n\n(MSEC), \n\nfor \n\nObjective and\nScope\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory C.

The  loan  will\nhave a maturity of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe loan will carry an annual interest charge of 1 percent during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period.\n\n\fiv\n\nProgram Period\n\n            and Tranching\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement\n\nThe  loan  is  expected  to  be  used  over  36  months  commencing\nfrom  the date of  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  may  be\nused  to  finance  the  cost  of  eligible  imports  incurred  within  180\ndays prior to the date of effectiveness. The loan will be released\nin  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  will  be  $5  million  equivalent,\nand the second tranche $10 million equivalent. The first tranche\nwill be released upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The\nsecond tranche  is expected to  be  released  by  December  2001,\nsubject  to  the  fulfillment  of  all  conditions  for  release  of  the\nsecond  tranche  set  forth  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  FSP  II  also\ncontains  a  set  of  conditions  that  must  be  fulfilled  for  its\nsuccessful completion.\n\nThe  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for\nthe  FSP  II.  It  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementation,\nincluding  the  administration  and  disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of quarterly\nprogress reports on FSP II implementation. A steering committee\nhas been established to oversee the FSP II implementation. The\ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOM,  and\nwill  include  high-level  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of\nFinance  (MOF),  MSEC,  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE),\nSSIGO,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  State  Property  Committee.  The\nsteering committee will meet at least once every three months to\nensure that the proposed reforms are undertaken in accordance\nwith  the  agreed  timetable.  An  adequately  staffed  program\nimplementing unit has been established within BOM.\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign\nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  imports\nprocured  in  and  from  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  those\nspecified in a list of ineligible items and those items financed by\nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  official  sources.  All  procurement\nunder  the  loan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial\npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed\nprocurement  procedures  acceptable \nto  ADB,  with  due\nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Borrower  will\ncertify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of\nthe  projected  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  in  a  given\nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds\nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds\nwill be used to finance the structural adjustment costs for reforms\nto be initiated and implemented under the FSP II.\n\n\fv\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nthrough \n\nreforms \n\nlegal  and \n\nTo help the Government implement the FSP II, ADB will provide\nTA  for  $600,000  equivalent  to  strengthen  financial  sector\ndevelopment.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  strengthening  of  the\nbanking  supervision  system and development of  loan  collateral;\nregulatory\n(ii) capital  market \nstrengthening of the equity markets; and (iii) strengthening of the\nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  developing\ncontractual savings institutions. The TA will be financed by ADB\non  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  It  is\nestimated \ninternational\nthat  about  18  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  and  10  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  All  consultants  will  be\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for  the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants.\n\nThe principal  risk  lies  in  the  timing  of  the  proposed  FSP  II.  The\nFSP II loan will be presented for Board consideration just prior to\na  Parliamentary  election.  It  is  expected  that  the  FSP  II  will  be\nratified  by  the  current  Parliament  (within  July).  However,  if  this\nParliament  does  not  ratify  the  FSP  II,  then  the  new  Parliament\nmay  need  additional  lead  time  before  final  ratification.  This\nconcern  is  considered  manageable  in  view  of  the  nature  of  the\npolicy actions proposed under  FSP  II,  which  have  support  from\nthe various political groups.\n\nA  second  risk  is  that,  because  of  resistance  or  lack  of\ncooperation by vested interests, the Government may be unable\nto  implement  the  policy  measures  required  to  strengthen  legal\nprovisions and privatization of the MSE. In addition, there may be\nrisks  associated  with  weak  capacity  at  the  agency  level  to\nsuccessfully  implement  the  reforms,  as  well  as  risks  stemming\nfrom  weak  coordination  between  institutions.  To  address  these\ndownside  risks  from  weak  capacity,  TA  will  be  provided  to  key\nagencies\u2014BOM,  MOF,  MSEC,  SSIGO\u2014for \ninstitutional\nupgrading. Policy coordination will be supported by the high-level\nsteering committee and  program implementation unit.\n\n\f I. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program (FSP II).  The report also describes\nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Financial Sector Development, and if the\nproposed loan is approved by  the  Board,  I,  acting  under  the authority  delegated  to  me by  the\nBoard, shall approve the TA.\n\n II. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn  1991,  Mongolia  began  a  comprehensive  reform  process.  The goal  was  to  transform\nthe  economy  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based  system.  The  Government\u2019s  reform\nprogram, backed by firm external assistance, sought to achieve a systemic transformation to a\nreduce  poverty.  The  economic\nmarket  economy,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and \ntransformation has been marked  by the  removal of price  controls, privatization of  state-owned\nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  development  of  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector-led\ndevelopment supported by a  relatively  small  and fragile financial  system.  The  impact of  these\nreforms led to an average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.6 percent over\nthe last five years. Inflation has been brought down from over 50 percent in 1996 to single digit\nin  1998  (although  it  increased  to  10  percent  in  1999).  However,  in  several  areas  economic\nprogress has been frequently interrupted by protracted political uncertainties and terms of trade\nshocks  due  to  volatile  commodity  export  prices  because  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  small,\nnarrow-based, open economy. These developments have often strained the fiscal and external\naccounts.\n\n3.\nThe  economic  and  political  vulnerabilities  have  complicated  the  process  of  financial\nsector development in Mongolia. To lay the foundation for a sound and market-oriented financial\nsector,  the  Government  launched  the  first  phase  of  its  financial  sector  reforms  from  1996  to\n1999. This  was  supported  by the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Financial  Sector  Program\n(FSP) loan1, for SDR24.201 million ($35 million equivalent) and two TAs.2 The FSP focused on\n(i)  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  financial  sector  consistent  with\ninternational  standards;  (ii) restructuring  the  banking  system  to  strengthen  viable  banks  and\nclose  insolvent  banks;  (iii)  reducing  the  Government\u2019s  involvement,  while  encouraging  market\norientation and commercializing the banking system; and (iv) developing capacities to  improve\nbank  credit  and  risk  management,  portfolio  and  asset-liability  management  systems,  and\nsupervision systems.\n\nImplementation of the FSP,3 though somewhat slower than expected, helped introduce\n4.\nmarket  orientation  and  commercialization  in  the  banking  system.  Key  reforms  included\nliberalizing banking policies, strengthening regulations, and restoring health of the viable banks,\nwhile closing insolvent banks. Currently with the exception of the Agricultural Bank (AB) under\nreceivership,  and  Savings  Bank  (SB)  with  lending  restrictions  and  pending  restructuring,  all\nbanks  meet  capital  adequacy  requirements.  Furthermore,  comparing  prudential  regulations  in\nthe  banking  system  as  a  whole  between  December  1997  and  December  1999  reveals  that\ncapital adequacy, liquidity, foreign exchange exposure, and loan loss provisioning requirements\n\n                                               \n1 \n2\n\nLoan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program, for  $35 million, approved on 19 December 1996.\nTA  2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of Bank of Mongolia,  for  $1 million,\napproved on 19 December 1996; and TA Loan 1510-MON: Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks,\nfor $3 million, approved on 19 December 1996 to support loan implementation.\n\n3  R107-99:  Loan  1509-MON:  Financial Sector Program  Loan,  Progress  Report:  Release  of  Second  Tranche,\n\n15 July 1999.\n\n\f2\n\nhave all improved. However, the financial sector remains weak, lacks diversification, and plays a\nlimited  role  in  the  economy.  Financial  intermediation  in  Mongolia  would  benefit  from  stronger\nand  better  managed  banks,  together  with  the  development  of  nonbank  financial  institutions\n(NBFIs).  The  structure  of  the  financial  sector  is  unbalanced,  the  stock  market  is  small  and\nilliquid, and market-based insurance and leasing businesses are just beginning to emerge.\n\n5.\nThe  FSP  complemented  and  reinforced  the  enhanced  structural  adjustment  facility\n(ESAF),  for  1997-2000,  approved  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Although  the first\nannual  arrangement  eventually  lapsed  on  30 July  1998  due  to  a  sharp  deterioration  in  the  fiscal\naccounts,  in  July  1999  the  Government  negotiated  a  second  annual  arrangement  of  SDR14.8\nmillion  for  1999-2000.  Under  the  ESAF,  the  Government  adopted  a  strong  macroeconomic\nstabilization  program  based on  (i)  tight fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to  curb  inflationary  pressures\nand (ii) wide-ranging sector reforms to strengthen banking.\n\n6.\n  To  carry  forward  the  first  phase  of  financial  sector  reforms,  the  Government  with  the\nassistance  of  the  International  Development  Association  (IDA),  formulated  a  long-term  vision\nand  medium-term  strategy  for  financial  sector  development.4  These  were  discussed  at  an\nexternal assistance  coordination  meeting  in  Ulaanbaatar  in  February  2000.  To  implement  this\nstrategy, the Government asked ADB and IDA to support the second phase of financial sector\nreforms. In response, ADB and IDA have developed a comprehensive Financial Sector Reform\nProgram  (FSRP)  covering  the  various  subsectors  of  the  financial  sector  for  potential  parallel\nfinancing of the associated costs of structural  adjustments.  This  umbrella program, the  FSRP,\nwill  be    supported  by  (i)  a  financial  sector  adjustment  credit  (FSAC)  of  $32 million  equivalent\napproved by IDA on 20 April 20005 and (ii) the proposed FSP II.\n\n7.\nThe  broad  objectives  and  scope  of  the  FSP  II  were  discussed  with  the  Government\nduring the Reconnaissance Mission fielded in January 2000. Following this, ADB participated in\nthe external assistance coordination meeting in February to finalize the pace and sequence of\noverall  financial  sector  reforms  over  the  medium  term.  An  ADB  mission  subsequently  visited\nWashington in March 2000 to discuss the FSRP with the Government, and develop coordination\njoint  ADB-IDA  mission6  visited\nand  parallel \nUlaanbaatar  in  late  March  2000  and  reached  agreements  on  a  common  development  policy\nletter and policy  matrix  (Appendix 1)  which form  the basis for the  FSRP. At  IDA\u2019s  request,  an\nADB representative attended the World Bank Board presentation of the FSAC.\n\nfinancing  arrangements.  Subsequently,  a \n\n8.\nThe implementation of this common policy framework will be jointly supervised by ADB\nand  IDA.  Under the  agreed  arrangements, the  FSAC  will focus on  banking  reforms,  while  the\nFSP  II  will  focus  on  reforms  of  financial  governance,  nonbank  financial  (NBF)  intermediaries\n(including capital market development), and contractual savings. See policy matrix for FSP II in\nAppendix 2. The FSP II program framework is presented in Appendix 3.\n\n                                               \n4  World Bank. 1999.

Escudero, Sr. Counsel of IDA  participated in the Mission.\n\n\f3\n\n III. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\n9.\nThe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  economic  adjustment  and  reform  strategy  aims  to\nstabilize  the  economy  and  maintain  social  protection  programs  within  a  prudent  medium-term\nexpenditure  framework.  The  reform  strategy  also  seeks  to  accelerate  enabling  structural\nreforms that facilitate private sector-led development as well as public sector restructuring. This\nstabilization and adjustment program is complemented by investments in social  and economic\ninfrastructure  that  aim  to  reduce poverty and  strengthen  Mongolia\u2019s  competitiveness.  The  key\ncomponents  of  the  strategy  include  (i) macroeconomic  stabilization,  (ii)  financial  sector\ndevelopment,  (iii)  private  sector  development,  (iv)  new  approaches \ninfrastructure\ndevelopment,  (v) promotion  of  foreign  direct  investment,  (vi) promotion  of  export-oriented\nindustries, and (vii) human and social sector development.\n\nto \n\n10.\nThe Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy emphasizes sustained economic\ngrowth and development of a strong financial sector. The strategy highlights the importance of\ndeveloping  a  healthy  financial    system  to  improve  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilize  savings,\nand restore credit to cash-strapped sectors of the economy.  For a more detailed presentation of\nthe Government\u2019s long-term vision and medium-term strategy for financial  sector development\nsee paras. 52-53.\n\nB.\n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n\n1.\n\nMacroeconomic Performance\n\n11.\nMongolia  began  the  transition  to  a  market-based  economy  in  1991.  Following  three\nyears of adjustment characterized by negative growth, the economy grew at an average annual\nrate of 3.6 percent during 1994-1999. The source of growth is traced primarily to private sector-\nled  agriculture  sector  development,  following  the  privatization  of  livestock  herding  and\nmanufacturing,  and  expansion  of  service.  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  performance  is  heavily\ndependent  on  the  production  and  export  of  primary  commodities  including  cashmere,  copper,\nand  gold.  These  three  commodities  are,  however  prone  to  volatile  price  fluctuations  in  world\nmarkets, which have exposed Mongolia to significant terms of trade shocks in 1994, 1996, and\nagain in 1998 that have adversely affected macroeconomic stability.7 The severe winter of 1999-\n2000 resulting in a  serious depletion  of  Mongolia\u2019s  livestock have far-reaching  implications for\npoverty reduction in the coming years.\n\n12.\nNotwithstanding terms of trade reversals, the macroeconomic framework has gradually,\nalbeit modestly, improved. Tight monetary policy pursued during 1997-1999 has resulted in the\ninflation  rate  dropping  from  53  percent  in  1996  to  6  percent  in  1998,  even  though  it  rose  to\n10 percent  in  1999.  While  tugrug  depreciation  was  moderate  in  early  1998,  the  Bank  of\nMongolia (BOM) devalued the currency by 16 percent in mid-1998 to accommodate the sudden\nfall in copper prices. Monetary policy will continue to aim at containing inflation at a single-digit\nrate and facilitate exchange rate management in order to build up international reserves.\n\n13.\nFor  the  past  five  years,  the  budget  deficit  averaged  10 percent  of  GDP  (excluding\nprivatization  proceeds).  Despite  a  3 percent  increase  in  the  value-added  tax  (from  10  to  13\npercent in 1998), the introduction of a $7 per ton excise tax on petroleum, and the reinstatement\n\n                                               \n7  Since  late  1997  average  export  prices  of copper fell  by  23  percent,  cashmere  21  percent;  and  gold  5  percent\n\nresulting in a fall of export earnings of 23 percent in 1998.\n\n\f4\n\nof a 5 percent import tax in 1999, difficulties in mobilizing tax revenue continue. Tax revenues,\nwhich represent 18 percent of GDP, could be improved. As a result of weak revenue collection,\nfiscal adjustments have been mostly accommodated by reductions of capital expenditures. This\nhas dampened long-term economic growth prospects. The severe terms of trade shock and the\nspillovers  of  the  Asian  and  Russian  crises  have  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  budget\ndeficit,8  which  rose  to  11.3  percent  in  1998.  The  Government\u2019s  move  to  defer  its  pension\nliabilities and  social  transfers has affected  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population.  In  addition,\ndelays in interest payments on bank restructuring bonds have negatively affected the financial\nposition  of  the  banks.  Prudent  fiscal  management  will  be  critical  to  achieving  and  sustaining\nmacroeconomic stability.\n\n14.\nMongolia\u2019s balance of payment position has been tenuous. In 1998, the external current\naccount  deficit  deteriorated  and  rose  to  11.4  percent  of  GDP.  The  weakness  of  the  external\naccount  stems from the  country\u2019s  narrow export base,  which  is  heavily  dependent  on  primary\ncommodities that are subject to higher price volatility. Foreign direct investment inflows continue\nto  be  moderate;  annual  inflows  rose  to  $2.9 million  in  1999  from  $2.6  million  in  1997.\nInternational  reserves  rose  to  $100  million  in  1999  (11.6  weeks  of  import  coverage),  up  from\n$75 million  (7.1  weeks  of  import  coverage)  in  1998  reflecting  the  tugrug  depreciation  in  1998\nand the effects on net exports (largely due to a decrease in imports). The domestic and external\nresource gaps have been met by external borrowing. By the end of 1999, the external debt grew\nto an estimated 78 percent of GDP (up from 53 percent in 1995).  However, most of this debt\nhas  been  contracted  on  a  long-term,  concessional  basis.  The  Government  continues  to  limit\nforeign borrowing to concessional lending. Despite moderate improvements to macroeconomic\nmanagement,  Mongolia  remains  a  relatively  poor  country  with  income  per  capita  estimated  at\n$430  with  official  development  assistance  contributing  up  to  30  percent  of  the  consolidated\nbudget. This makes Mongolia one of the biggest recipients of multilateral aid in per capita terms.\nA recent sovereign risk rating by an international credit rating agency classified the country as B\nminus. Trends in key macroeconomic indicators for 1994-1999 are presented in Supplementary\nAppendix A.\n\n2.\n\nMacroeconomic Prospects\n\nThe  Government  with  IMF  support  has  embarked  on  a  strong  adjustment  program  to\n15.\nmaintain inflation below 10 percent, promote sustained annual output growth of about 4 percent,\nand strengthen Mongolia\u2019s external position. Central to  the  achievement of  these objectives  is\nthe implementation of a fiscal policy package designed to reduce the overall Government deficit\nto 6.5 percent of GDP by 2001, from 11.3 percent in 1998. This fiscal policy package, presented\nto Parliament in April 1999, includes measures to increase Government revenue by 2 percent of\nGDP  and  reduce  its  spending  by about 1  percent  of GDP on  an  annual  basis.  The  goal  is  to\neliminate  net  bank  credit  to  the  Government  by  2000,  thereby  averting  a  resurgence  of\ninflationary  pressures  and  freeing-up  additional  resources  for  private  sector  development.\nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  public  sector  reform  program  and  acceleration  of  the\nprivatization of the most valuable SOEs are critical for fiscal consolidation. At the same time, the\nadoption of a flexible  exchange  rate  policy  will  facilitate  smooth  adjustment  to  changes  in  the\nterms of trade.\n\n16.\nMongolia\u2019s medium-term economic outlook is predicated on  the  Government\u2019s  success\nin  adhering  to  fiscal  and  monetary  programs  in  support  of  strengthening  macroeconomic\nfundamentals.  In  particular,  the  fiscal  position  needs  to  be  strengthened  by  improving  tax\n\n                                               \n8 \n\nLosses in unrealized budget revenues in 1998 were approximately Tug20 billion reflecting decreased income tax\nand dividend payments from Erdenet Mining Corporation.\n\n\f5\n\nrevenue collection. The effects of the Zud\u2014the severe winter condition that killed 2 million head\nof  livestock  out  of  a  total  stock  of  32  million\u2014will  put  pressure  on  the  fiscal  and  monetary\nprograms.  Preliminary estimates put the livestock losses at up to $30 million. The Government\nexpenditures will likely rise in response to the emergency, thus fueling inflationary expectations.\nEfforts to contain public spending in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for July\n2000  are  also  being  closely  monitored.  The  continued  maintenance  of  a  prudent  monetary\npolicy  will  help  contain  inflationary  pressures  emanating  from  external  shocks  and  domestic\nrelative price adjustments. In the longer term, sustained improvements in Mongolia\u2019s welfare will\nalso crucially hinge on how efficiently it diversifies its economy and reduces dependence on the\nexploitation of primary  commodities,  such  as  copper,  for  income  and  employment  generation.\nTo  reduce  the  destabilizing  effects  of  the  significant  price  volatility  of  key  commodities,  the\nFSAC  will  seek  to  introduce  measures  to  mitigate  risks  and  improve  macroeconomic\nmanagement.\n\n17.\nIn  addition  to  these  macroeconomic  policy  measures,  the  Government  recognizes  that\nits strategy for private sector-led growth must  also  be built  on  the foundation  of  a  solvent  and\nefficient  financial  system.  Moderate  fiscal  deficits  coupled  with  single-digit  inflation  over  the\nmedium term should lead to a lowering of the central bank\u2019s bill rate (short-term monetary policy\ninstrument).  Combined  with  ongoing  bank  restructuring  and  loan  recovery  efforts  to  be\nsupported  under  the  FSRP,  the  lowered  central  bank  bill  rate  is  expected  to  result  in  lower\ninterest spreads and improve financial intermediation. This is likely to improve access to credit\nin the economy. The enhanced banking regulatory framework  will  improve  asset quality  in  the\nbanking system. These measures combined with the continuation of official loan disbursements\nand improvements in foreign direct investment inflows are expected to help improve economic\ngrowth prospects in the medium term.\n\nA.\n\nBackground, Constraints, and Issues\n\n IV. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\n1.\n\nBanking System\n\na.\n\nBackground\n\n18.\nMongolia currently has 12 licensed commercial banks, with a network of over 500 branches,\nsubbranches, and cash counters, while foreign  (minority)  participation  is  limited  to  one  bank.  The\nbanks  have  about  500,000  customers  and  employ  approximately  2,000  people.  As  of  December\n1999, the three largest  banks  in  terms  of  assets\u2014Trade  and  Development  Bank  (TDB),  SB,  and\nGolomt  Bank\u2014held  some  80  percent  of  all  bank  assets.  In  terms  of  deposit  liabilities  (time  and\ndemand  deposits),  SB  alone  had  about  46  percent  of  total  deposits.  Net  lending  in  the  banking\nsystem is Tug53.6 billion backed by total assets of Tug182 billion. Capital adequacy in the banking\nsystem is 20 percent. As of December 1999, the three problem banks\u2014AB, Bank of Investment and\nTechnological Innovation (BITI), and Reconstruction Bank (RB)\u2014accounted for about 10 percent of\ntotal  assets and 56  percent  (BITI  and  RB  account  for  50  percent)  of  nonperforming  loans  in  the\nbanking  system.  Eight  banks  are  fully  or  partially  owned  by  the  Government.  Fully  private\ncommercial banks account for about 10 percent of all assets. Financial intermediation through the\nbanking system is limited. There is a narrow range of financial  instruments  (domestic  and foreign\ncurrency  deposits,  and  treasury  and  central  bank  bills),  with  only  one  bank  offering  a  checking\naccount facility.\n\n19.\nFinancial sector reforms in Mongolia were initiated in 1991. To replace the monobanking\nsystem,  the  Government  established  a  two-tier  banking  system  and  entrusted  Bank  of  Mongolia\n\n\f6\n\n(BOM)  with  responsibility  for  maintaining  monetary  stability  and  supervising  the  operations  of\ncommercial banks. During 1991-1995, measures were taken to phase out directed lending, improve\nbanking  regulations,  and  encourage  commercial  banks  to  adopt  better  credit  management.\nHowever,  the  banking  system  remained  fragile.  Commercial  banks  had  loan-to-deposit  ratios  of\nmore  than  80 percent,  were  unable  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  to  service  the  needs  of  their\nclients, and violated reserve requirements and liquidity norms stipulated by BOM. Four of the five\nlarge commercial banks and three of the smaller, privately owned, banks were technically insolvent.\nIn part, the weaknesses of the banking system reflected (i) carryover costs associated with inherited\nand directed loans, (ii) poor management,  (iii)  a  weak  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework,  and\n(iv) a limited skills base.\n\n20.\nIn July 1996, the incoming Government announced a plan to promote the establishment\nof a sound market-based financial system. Salient features of this plan, supported by ADB, IMF,\nand World  Bank,  include  (i)  closure  of  two  large  insolvent  banks:  Ardyn  Bank  and  Insurance\nBank; (ii) the creation of the Mongolian Asset Restructuring Agency to purchase nonperforming\nassets of banks in exchange for Government bonds; (iii) establishment of two new banks,  RB\nand SB, with the former inheriting the performing loans and commercial deposits, and the latter\ntaking  over  the  household deposits of  the  two  closed  banks;  and  (iv)  restructuring  of  AB  and\nBITI.  These  reforms  restored  some  confidence  in  the  banks  in  1997.  This  led  to  a  rise  in\ndeposits,  bank  profitability,  and  their  capital  adequacy  (to  12.5 percent,  exceeding  the  10\npercent  prescribed  minimum),  as  well  as  to  some  improvement  in  asset  quality  and  banking\nsystem  liquidity.  However,  progress  in  banking  system  reforms  was  overshadowed  in  early\n1998 by the failed merger of RB and Golomt Bank. This diverted resources needed for financial\nsector  reforms  and  delayed  the  progress  of  financial  sector  restructuring.  Imprudent  lending,\nand poor management and internal controls generated heavy losses for RB.\n\n21.\nFrom July 1998 and throughout the six-month hiatus under a caretaker government, reforms\nslowed. In December 1998, the Parliament appointed the current Government. In February 1999, a\nbank restructuring action plan, was agreed to by the Government, ADB, IMF, and the United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID). Under this plan, the management of three insolvent\nbanks,  AB,  BITI,  and  RB,  were  removed  and  replaced  by  conservators  in  February-May  1999.\nReorganization  plans  were  approved  and  implemented,  leading  to  operational  and  financial\nrestructuring. Shareholders in AB and BITI were asked to increase the capital (RB is state-owned),\nand following the negative response, shareholders\u2019 capital was written down to cover the losses. In\nOctober 1999, BOM placed BITI and RB under receivership, revoked their licenses, and proceeded\nwith an orderly liquidation of the two banks. In the case of AB, a receiver was appointed in October,\nand a restructuring plan was approved to rehabilitate the bank.\n\n22.\nDespite a  difficult political  environment  and  the  severe  external  supply  shocks  induced\nby the combined effects of the Asian and Russian Crises in 1997 and 1998, by December 1999,\nthe  Government  had satisfactorily  complied  with  the  reform  program  under  the  FSP  (footnote\n1).9  Notable  achievements  under  the  FSP  include  the  adoption  and  enforcement  of  improved\nprudential regulations and supervision, and steps to facilitate debt recovery and eliminate bank\ninsolvency.  The  FSP  also  supported  strengthening  market  discipline  by  reducing  state\ninvolvement  in  the  management  of  banks10  and  tightening  enforcement  of  banking  laws  to\naddress  the  pervasive  default  culture.  This  was  also  intended  to  improve  the  debt  recovery\nproblems largely responsible for the large share of nonperforming loans and weak asset quality\n\n                                               \n9  The Progress Report (footnote 3) provides a detailed assessment of financial sector reforms implemented under\n\nthe FSP.\n\n10  State involvement in the banking system was exercised directly through state ownership of banks and indirectly\n\nby influencing lending policies through directed credit programs.\n\n\f7\n\nin the banking system. Bank restructuring activities were a central focus of the FSP and after a\nslow start, 8 (of 20) banks were closed from June 1998 to December 1999. In addition, and to\nprevent the entry of weak banks, licensing requirements were strengthened and minimum bank\npaid-in capital was increased (para. 27). Supplementary Appendix B presents data on banking\nsystem indicators.\n\nb.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n23.\nNotwithstanding  these  improvements,  the  banking system  remains  fragile.  The  second\nphase of banking reform is now directed at addressing structural problems with the objective of\nstrengthening  financial  intermediation  in  the  economy.  A  healthy  banking  system  will  support\nefficient intermediation and improve growth prospects of the economy. To lay firm foundations\nfor the development of a sound and stable financial system, the following systemic weaknesses\nneed to be addressed.\n\ni.\n\nHigh Intermediation Cost\n\n24.\nThe fundamental  issue  to  be  addressed by  the  FSRP  is  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  the\nreduction  of  the  high  intermediation  spreads  in  the  banking  system.  The  spreads  are\nsymptomatic  of  general  distress  in  the  banks  reflecting  the  increased  risks  of  default,  high\noperating  costs,  and  large  stock  of  nonperforming  assets  in  the  banks\u2019  portfolios.  Short-term,\ndomestic  currency  loans  are  being  contracted  at  annual  (nominal)  average  interest  rates\nranging  from  24  to  47  percent,  and  banks  pay  annual  (nominal)  average  deposit  rates  on\ndomestic  currency  time  deposits  of  about  10  to  30  percent.  Despite  a  significant  reduction  in\ninflation over the past two years, only recently has there been a fall in the central bank bills rate\n(benchmark monetary policy instrument) which is now at 11 percent compared with 20 percent\nin  April  1999.  In  addition,  limited  availability  of  marketable  collateral  has  constrained  lending\nactivities  throughout  the  banking  system.  Improving  asset  quality  in  the  system  and  ensuring\ntimely  access  to  secured  collateral  will  be  key  to  relaxing  credit  constraints,  reducing  interest\nspreads, and improving financial intermediation.\n\nii.\n\nRegulatory Forbearance\n\n25.\nFaced with what was an undercapitalized banking system, the central bank has focused\non  restoring  the  health  of  problem  banks  by  facilitating  their  recapitalization  through  profit\nretention  and/or  debt  write-offs.  However,  political  pressures  together  with  continued  lax\nlending,  limited  supervision  capabilities,  and  weak  legal  enforcement  for  debt  recovery  have\naggravated  the  problem  of  nonperforming  loans.  Ad  hoc  liquidity  support  to  insolvent  banks\nunder lender of last resort arrangements, reinforced by the absence of explicit safety nets in the\nbanking system, has led to direct Government involvement through bailouts. This has resulted\nin a large fiscal restructuring cost of approximately 5 percent of GDP over the past four years.\n\niii.\n\nWeak  Governance  and  Internal  Controls  in  the  Banking\nSystem\n\n26.\nBanks are poorly managed and have limited commercial orientation. State-owned banks are\noperated by managers who were trained under the old system based on directed lending that was\nsubject  to  political  interference.  Newly  privatized  banks  are  owned  by  individuals  who  view\nownership primarily as a means to finance their business activities over any other priority. In addition\nto insider lending, lending to related parties continues and is often supported by less stringent credit\nevaluation, or other privileges at times exceeding the regulatory limit. In other instances, loans have\ncontinued to flow to companies despite debt-servicing problems. In the absence  of  qualified bank\n\n\f8\n\nmanagers, internal oversight is weak with lack of understanding of rules of responsibility and weak\nenforcement  of  checks  and  balances.  The  limited  disclosure  and  reporting  requirements  together\nwith the absence of effective accountability perpetuates bad management.\n\niv.\n\nLimited Incentives Framework to Support the Development of\nStrong Banks\n\n27.\nThe  development  of  a  core,  sound  banking  system  is  constrained  by  lax  bank  entry\nconditions,  weak  regulatory  oversight,  and  the  absence  of  a  clear  bank  exit  strategy.  In\nSeptember  1999,  the  minimum  bank  paid-in  capital  was  raised  to  Tug1  billion  from  Tug400\nmillion (and is to be raised  to  Tug2  billion for  all banks under  the  FSAC  effective  June 2001).\nBank  licensing  is  not  subject  to  standard  testing  based  on  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d11  conditions;  this\nerodes the development of sound banks with strong management. Despite attempts to use the\npower of  the  law  to  deal  with  negligence  and  malfeasance  on  the  part  of  bank  owners  which\ncaused bankruptcy,  the  weak  legal and  regulatory  framework  and  the  attendant  moral  hazard\nproblem  continue  to  present  major  hurdles  to  developing  a  healthy  banking  system.  On  the\nregulatory side, there is limited scope to take advance and effective prior action in the case of\nearly warnings of bank distress. There is no bank insolvency law in place (although a draft law\nhas  been  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA)  nor  any  prompt  corrective  action  program  linking\nremedial trigger actions to specific capital targets. To strengthen the banking system, it is critical\nthat  the  Government  adopt  a  bank  exit  strategy  that  is  incentive  compatible,  places  ultimate\nresponsibility for bank failure on the owners, and stresses prompt action to resolve failed banks.\n\nv.\n\nLimited Reach of Financial Services\n\n28.\nThe banking system provides a narrow range of financial instruments usually limited to\ndemand, savings, and time deposits on the liabilities side. Government bonds and treasury and\ncentral bank  bills  dominate  assets.  In  the absence of a functioning  interbank  market, financial\nmarket are generally not liquid. Loans are concentrated in few enterprises and often confined to\nbetter-known firms. Difficulties in registering and accessing even the limited types of property as\nloan  collateral  due  to  institutional  and  legal  constraints  further  undermines  lending  activities.\nTerm finance is unavailable; the usual practice to overcome  this  problem  is  to  continue  rolling\nover  short-term  loans.  This  generates  maturity  mismatch  and  increases  overall  risk  in  the\nbanking system. In the rural areas, formal lending is even more constrained  than  in  the urban\nareas.  Prior  to  1999,  the  rural  areas  were  serviced  by  AB,  and  will  be  partly  serviced  by  the\nMongol  Post  Bank  (BOM  has  issued  lending  licenses  to  Mongol  Post  Bank  in  five  aimags\n[provinces])  and  AB  (upon  successful  restructuring  and  recapitalization).  The  newly  formed\nsavings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs)  and  finance  companies  offer  a  new  channel  for\nincreasing the provision of financial services in the rural areas. The pawnshops provide the bulk\nof  informal  lending. Secondary  markets  in  existing  assets  are  thin,  and  raising  equity  through\nthe stock market is not yet a viable option for the corporate sector.\n\n2.\n\nNonbank Financial Sector\n\nMongolia\u2019s  NBF  sector,  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development,  comprises  SCCs,  finance\n29.\ncompanies,  and  leasing  companies.  SCCs  were  reintroduced  in  Mongolia  in 1997  following  what\nwas an extended use of credit cooperatives prior to 1991. In three years, 32 SCCs were licensed.\nSCCs  are  registered  and  affiliated  to  two  competing  and  separate associations, or  federations  of\nSCCs.  These  include  the  National  Confederation  of  Savings  and  Credit  Cooperatives  with  21\n\n                                               \n11  \u201cFit and proper\u201d conditions require the regulator to ensure that bank management has the necessary knowledge,\n\nbackground, and experience to operate a bank.\n\n\f9\n\nmembers and the Association of Savings and Credit Cooperative with 11 members. In addition, all\nSCCs are registered with the tax office.\n\n30.\nSCCs  provide  loans  ranging  between  $500  and  $3,000  according  to  the  needs  of  their\nmembers. Loans tend to be used for trade finance and seed capital for business start-ups. Lending\nrates  generally  reflect  cost  of  capital;  however  they are  lower  than  rates  charged  by  pawnshops.\nThe SCCs, like all forms of cooperatives, are basically operating as self-regulatory organizations as\nallowed for under the Cooperatives Act, and are governed by their members according to the rule:\none member, one vote.\n\n31.\nThe number of SCCs has been rapidly increasing; in 1999 21 new licenses were issued.\nThis expansion largely reflects the difficulties small firms and households face, in gaining access to\ncredit from banking institutions. Given Mongolia\u2019s small capital base and small and widely dispersed\npopulation, SCCs are  well suited to lend especially in rural areas where maintaining an extensive\nbranch banking network may not be a  viable option.  Most  SCCs  have  been established  in  urban\ncenters, and it is expected that these will soon expand into rural areas.\n\nAlthough SCCs by virtue of their small size are not a  potential  source of systemic  risk,\n32.\nthere is practically no regulatory oversight other than informal means of enforcing discipline through\npeer  (member)  pressure.  Some  SCCs  have  already  failed,  and  if  this  subsector  is  to  expand,\nconfidence must be built by bringing  them  under  systematic  supervision  and  regulation.  To  avoid\nany ensuing regulatory fragmentation and coordination failures, and the cost implications of starting\nup a new institution, BOM should provide regulatory oversight of SCCs.\n\n33.\nIn  1999,  following  BOM\u2019s  approval  of  basic  regulations  on  finance  companies  (non-\ndeposit-taking  institutions),  BOM  licensed  operations  of  two  finance  companies.  Licenses  were\nissued to (i) a former bank, Bayanbogd Bank, that was unable to meet the minimum paid-in capital\nrequirement  (Tug1  billion)  and  (ii)  a  former  cooperative,  Golden  Fund,  which  was  supported  by\nMicro Start,  a  program  of  the  United  Nations  Development Programme.  Golden  Fund  has  grown\nquite rapidly over the past six months successfully expanding operations. Golden Fund intends to\ndevelop as a microlending institution. Several nongovernment organizations have been supporting\nGolden  Fund,  including  the  National  Association  of  Mongolia  Agricultural  Cooperatives,  LEOS  (a\nwomen\u2019s  organization),  Mongolia Women\u2019s  Federation,  rotary  clubs  (Ulaanbaatar),  Open  Society\n(Soros), and Local Development Fund. Golden Fund has lending operations in Ulaanbaatar, Khentii,\nand Dornogobi aimags, and provides loans of up to $300 at interest rates of 5-7 percent monthly,\nwith  1-10  months tenure  through five branches.  As  of  December  1999, Golden  Fund  had  a  loan\nportfolio  of  Tug1  billion  covering  some  5,000  loans.  Its  loan  portfolio  consists  of  trading  loans\n(70 percent),  small-scale  manufacturing  loans  (20  percent),  and  loans  in  the  services  sector\n(10 percent). The lending operations to date have registered a repayment rate of 98 percent. The\nchallenge facing Golden Fund is how to expand activities and remain commercially viable as it faces\nnonconcessional sources of financing and will have to operate under market conditions. Two new\nfinance companies were licensed in 2000, namely Gobi Initiative (supported by USAID) and Mongol\nCredit (supported by TACIS).\n\nFinance  companies  are  expected  to  focus  on  small  lending  activities,  primarily  business\n34.\nloans  in  urban  areas.  BOM  regulations  prohibit  finance  companies  from  deposit  taking.  This  is\nexpected  to  limit  their  ability  to  leverage  funds  and  inhibit  their  intermediation  functions.  Finance\ncompanies  are  not  expected  to  compete  with  banks  for  the  same  clientele,  but  instead,  are\nexpected  to  develop  small  lending  niche  markets.  Nevertheless,  they  need  to  operate  within  a\nsound prudential regulatory framework including capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, and other\nstandard  prudential  requirements.  There  are  two  financial  leasing  companies,  Boddi  Leasing\nCompany  and  Orchid  Leasing  Company.  Until  recently,  the  supervision  of  financial  leasing\n\n\f10\n\ncompanies was subject to uncertainty due to the debate between BOM and the Ministry of Finance\n(MOF)  about  which  institution  should  be  vested  with  this  responsibility.  Although  BOM  has  now\nbeen  vested  with  this  responsibility,  there  has  been  little  progress  over  the  past  two  years  in\nintroducing  minimum  prudential  standards  and  improved  reporting  requirements.  The  Supervision\nDepartment of BOM needs to be strengthened; otherwise enforcement capabilities will be severely\ntested.\n\n35.\nFinally,  various  leasing  companies  have  been  operating  for  the  past  few  years.  These\ncompanies  are  mostly  dealing  with  leasing  of  durable  goods,  plant,  and  equipment,  and  are  not\nsubject to any systematic oversight by a designated regulatory agency. Supplementary Appendix C\npresents some key data on nonbank financial companies.\n\n3.\n\nCapital Markets\n\na.\n\nBackground\n\n36.\nRelatively smaller than the  banking  system,  capital  market activity  started  in 1991  with\nthe  establishment  of  the  Government-owned  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE).  A  major\nimpetus to the stock market was provided by the privatization of SOEs during 1991-1994: SOE\ninvestment coupons were allocated to more than 2 million citizens for the purpose of trading on\nthe  MSE.  About  1.2  million  citizens  became  shareholders  of  470  companies.  In  September\n1994,  the  Securities  Law  of  Mongolia  was  enacted,  followed  by  the  establishment  of  the\nMongolian Securities and Exchange Commission (MSEC). The Partnership and Company Law\nwas enacted in May 1995, and amended in August 1999 as the Company Law.\n\nMSEC  was  established  by  the  Government  in  1995  to  regulate  and  monitor  securities\n37.\nmarket  trading.      It  has a Board of five  commissioners  \u2013 the  chairperson  is  nominated  by  the\nPrime Minister; one member is nominated by the minister of finance, another by the governor of\nBOM;  and  two  are  nominated  by  the  Parliament.  All  commissioners  serve  for  a  5-year  term.\nMSEC  is  also  responsible  for  implementing  the  Securities  Law  and  other  legislative  acts  and\nprocedures,  protecting  investor  interests,  enforcing  disclosure  requirements,  and  carrying  out\neducational and public awareness programs.\n\n38.\nThe  MSE  operates  as  a  nonprofit  (i.e.,  profits  revert  to  the  national  budget)  and  self-\nregulatory  organization.  It  has  six  departments  and  employs  over  60  staff.  The  Trading  and\nInformation  Department  is  responsible  for  organizing  the  trading  and  dissemination  of  market\ninformation  to  investors.    The  Listing  and  Supervision  Department  receives  applications  from\ncompanies to be listed on  the  MSE, oversees  disclosure  of financial  and  material  information;\nand  implements  supervision  of  trading,  clearing,  and  settlement  transactions.  The  Clearing,\nSettlement  and  Depository  Department  is  set  up  to  provide  a  book-entry  clearing  system.\nUnder this system, shares deposited by securities companies and other participants are held in\nthe central depository. Clients in turn must have only one account in the central depository, and\nmust  use  member  securities  companies  as  intermediaries.  All  stock  trading  at  the  MSE  is\nsettled the business day following the day of the transaction (T+1).\n\n39.\nActive secondary trading on the MSE started in August 1995. At present, there are 418\ncompanies  listed,  of  which  324  are  privatized  enterprises.  The  market  capitalization,  as  of\nFebruary 2000, was $37 million, close to 4 percent of GDP, down from $53 million in early 1998.\nTrading  activity has declined  sharply  over  the  last  year,  as  evidenced  by  the  drop  in  average\ndaily  trading  from  $25,000  in  September  1998  to  about  $13,000  in  January  2000.  Listed\ncompanies are classified according to one of three categories, A, B, or C, based upon standard\nindicators of asset  quality  such as price/earnings  ratios,  and  liquidity of the  shares.    Currently\n\n\f11\n\nthe majority of the listed companies are classified in C (or lowest) category. These companies\nare  supported  by  41  securities  brokerage  companies,    a  central  depository  agency  and  a\nclearing  agency.  No  foreign  companies  are  listed  on  the  MSE,  although  the  conditions  and\nrequirements for foreign companies are the same as for domestic companies.\n\nTo promote foreign investment, no tax is imposed on the dividend and profit gained from\n40.\nstock trading (however, a new law that will  tax dividends and profit from securities trading will\nbecome  effective  January  2001).  In  addition,  repatriation  of  profits  and  dividends,  as  well  as\nproceeds from the sale of assets and securities is permitted.\n\nb.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n41. While steps have been taken to develop the securities industry, the capital market is still\nat a nascent stage  of  development.  Major  supply-side  issues  include  a  small  corporate  sector\nand  slow  progress  in  privatizing  the  remaining  95  SOEs,  the  largest  of  which  are  likely  to  be\nsold  to  strategic  investors  outside  of  the  MSE.12  So  far  there  have  been  no  initial  public\nofferings.  On the demand side, limited capacity of MSEC to serve as an effective policymaker\nand  regulator  has  dampened  investor  confidence,  and  indicates  the  need  for  considerable\ninstitutional  strengthening.  Of  late,  there  have  been  cases  of  collusion  among  brokers  and\ndealers to influence price movements on the MSE, further undermining investor confidence.\n\nSecurities  companies  are  generally  weak.  Minimum  authorized  capital  of  a  securities\n42.\ncompany  according  to  the  Company  Law  is  Tug1  million  for  a  limited  liability  company  and\nTug10 million for a joint stock company. Admission fee into the MSE is Tug5 million (paid once)\nand  the  annual  membership  fee  Tug1  million.  More  recently  and  following  the  economic\ndownturn, there have been calls to lower the annual membership fee, although administration of\nthe MSE has not yet conceded to these demands.\n\n43.\nFollowing  the  fall  in  market  capitalization  and  because  of  the  difficulty  to  maintain\nprofitability, surviving securities companies have reacted to the market downturn by following a\ngrowth  strategy  based  on  charging  large  trading  commissions.  These  are  currently  set  at  5\npercent of the share price on any buy or sell order. A \u201cround trip\u201d leading to a buy and eventual\nsell  will  imply  an  investor\u2019s  reservation  value  on expected gains of at  least  10  percent.  These\nhigh transactions costs, which are tantamount to a tax on securities trading, represent a serious\nimpediment to fostering a vibrant securities market. The new regulations should clearly focus on\nthe  larger  interests  of  the  securities  industry  as  a  whole  and  not  protect  the  interests  of  a\nparticular group. In addition, securities companies which are financially weak need to strengthen\ntheir balance sheets in parallel with the strengthening of their commercial orientation in order to\ndevelop into professional client-based premier service providers.\n\nOn the supply side, over the short- to medium-term, the development of capital markets\n44.\nis closely linked to the success of the Government\u2019s privatization program. Following a lull in the\n1994-1996  privatization  program,  in  1997  the  Government  launched  a  second  phase  of  the\nprivatization  program  after  passage  of  the  new  Privatization  Law.  The  implementation  of  the\n1997-2000  privatization  program  has  led  to  the  privatization  of  some  900  SOEs  raising  total\nprivatization proceeds of Tug41 billion. A new privatization program is expected to be approved\nfollowing the formation of the new Government. Currently, many of the strategic SOEs are on a\nnegative list established by Parliament, thus preventing the Government from privatizing them.\n\n                                               \n12 Seventeen large, most-valuable SOEs are on a separate list, that will be approved by Parliament on a case-by-\ncase  basis.  These  include  TDB,  Neft  Petroleum  Import  Concern,  Gobi  Company,  Erdenet  Mining  Corporation,\nMongol Daatgal Insurance Company, Mongolian Stock Exchange, and MIAT Mongolian Airlines, (para. 44).\n\n\f12\n\nUnder the arrangement, any proposal to privatize the companies on the negative list will have to\nbe  presented  to  Parliament  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  The  measure  reflects  Parliament\u2019s\ninsistence on having a role in the divestment of  SOEs  in  strategic  sectors,  given the  sensitive\nnature  of  some  of  the  most  valuable  companies  rather  than  opposition  to  privatization.  The\n2000-2003  privatization  program  is  likely  to  be  as  strong  as  the  1997-2000  program.  It  is\nexpected that the sale of a part of these stocks through the MSE will strengthen investor interest\nin the stock exchange.\n\nto \n\ntheir  shareholding  structure.  Such  practices \n\n45. While the legal framework for establishing companies is in place, many enterprises have\nrecently  been  changing  their  legal  status  from  joint-stock  companies  to  limited  liability\ncompanies,  without  changes \nreduce\ntransparency  and  act  against  good  corporate  governance;  in  particular,  they  result  in  further\nneglect of the small  shareholder\u2019s  interests.    The  protection  of  investors\u2019  interests  is  critical  to\nfostering  increased  demand  for  tradable  stocks.    While  the  draft  Securities  Law  does  include\nactions  to  support  protection  of  small  investors\u2019  interests,  implementation  will  take  time.  The\ndraft law also gives greater power to MSEC to  strengthen  monitoring and  enforce  regulations.\nHowever,  the  institutional  capacity  at  MSEC  is  weak.  Unless  there  is  a  commitment  from  the\nGovernment  to  provide  additional  resources  and  improve  supervisory  and  regulatory  skills  at\nMSEC,  enforcement  will  be  compromised.  Public  awareness  of  the  benefits  and  risks  of  the\nequities  and  debt  markets  together  with  efforts  to  restructure  and  improve  MSEC,  including\nimproved accounting standards and timely flow of information, will also need to be strengthened\nto inspire greater investor confidence.\n\n46.\nIn addition, there is currently no legal basis for the development of institutional investors.\nLegislation,  regulations,  and  guidelines  for  their  operations  including  investment  funds  and\ntrusts  will  have  to  be  developed.  The  establishment  of  the  legal  infrastructure  to  support\ninstitutional  investors  will  lead  to  the  eventual  integration  of  contractual  savings  institutions  in\ncapital market development through pension and insurance funds, and enhance the prospects\nof longer-term sources of finance.  Finally, Mongolia is unique in terms of its Government-owned\nstock  exchange;  the  question  of  whether  capital  markets  can  be  made  more  vibrant  by\nprivatizating  the  MSE  must  be  examined.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  presents  statistics  on\ncapital market indicators.\n\n4.\n\nPension System\n\na.\n\nBackground\n\n47.\nThe development of the capital market will benefit from reform of the pension system to\nensure its social  and fiscal  sustainability.  Mongolia\u2019s  pension system  is  modeled on  a pay-as-\nyou-go system under which current generations contribute to meeting the pension obligations of\nretired workers. The Pension Fund, which is one of five social security funds, operates on a 19.0\npercent contribution from the wages of employed workers and 9.5 percent  contribution of  self-\nemployed  earnings.13  For  the  nongovernment  sectors,  employers  contribute  13.5  percent  of\ntheir  wages,  and  employees  5.5  percent;  whereas  government  employees  contribute\n1.1 percent of their wages with government contributing 17.9 percent. Coverage is mandatory,\nwith the exception of the self-employed and herders. Significant transfers from the Government\nbudget supplement these pension contributions, which are not accumulated or invested, in order\n                                               \n13 The other components of social insurance, with the respective employer-employee contributions from the wages,\ninclude  social benefits  insurance  (1.0  percent  each),  work  injury  insurance  (1.0-3.0  percent  contributed  by  the\nemployer),  unemployment  insurance  (0.5  percent  each)  and  health  insurance  (3.0  percent  each).  The  self-\nemployed contributions to these schemes are 1.0 percent,  no unemployment  contributions,  and  a  fixed  sum  of\nTug800 for health coverage.\n\n\f13\n\nto meet the current pension obligations. The collection of contributions and payment of benefits\nare  administered  by  the  State  Social  Insurance  General  Office  (SSIGO).  Like  other  transition\neconomies,  the  pension  system  has  been  affected  by  the  (i)  growing  number  of  unfunded\nliabilities; (ii) contribution arrears, particularly from state-owned bodies; and (iii) narrow base of\npension contributions relative to recipients  (low  replacement  rate).  Supplementary  Appendix  E\npresents data on pension funds.\n\nb. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\nTo  address  these  issues,  the  Government  pension  plan  aims  to  introduce  notionally\n48.\ndefined  individual  pension  accounts.  The  Law  on  Individual  Pension  Accounts,  adopted  by\nParliament  on  11 June  1999,  provides  that  workers  born  after  1  January  1960  will  be  given\nindividual  pension  accounts  indicating  their  past  pension  contributions  with  effect  from\n1 January 2000.14  One of the critical elements in the Government's decision to introduce partial\nfunding was the need  to  ensure  a  proper balance  between  the  long-run fiscal  sustainability  of\nthe pension system vis-\u00e0-vis intergenerational equity. While the new law will result in changes to\nthe benefit structure for many groups in the population, depending on years of service and the\ncurrent privileges they enjoy,  the  truncation  is  based on sound  actuarial  analysis  to  weigh  the\nnet  cash-flow  generation  under  various  reform  options.  The  cost  of  the  program  of  individual\naccounts  under  the  chosen  truncation  date  is  likely  to  grow  more  slowly  over  time  relative  to\nGDP  than  alternate  reform  options,  although  the  projections  are  subject  to  the  assumptions\nbeing  realized.  USAID  has  provided  TA  support  to  help  develop  administrative  systems  to\nintroduce notional individual accounts. The annual returns to the individual contributions will be\ndetermined by SSIGO. While the new system will enable pension payments to be closely linked\nto contributions, the pension fund will be unfunded for the foreseeable future. The Government\nplans  to  invest  a  part  of  the  contributions  of  the  younger  workers  in  the  domestic  capital\nmarkets.  The  Government  also plans  to  introduce  nonstate  voluntary  pensions  to  supplement\nthe current first pillar pension provisions.\n\n49. While  a  credible  reform  plan  has  been  formulated  by  the  Government  with  USAID  TA\nsupport, several critical issues need to be resolved. If the reform program is to be effective, the\ncreation of individual accounts has to be followed by  the  introduction  of partial funding.  In  this\nregard, the actual process and timing of the transition to partial funding and the associated costs\nneed to be carefully worked out. The investment potential in domestic capital markets is not yet\nclear,  and  needs  to  be  examined.  The  Government\u2019s  recent  announcement  to  increase\npensions to equalize the benefits between the pre- and post-1995 retirees has introduced some\ncomplexities  in  the  process  of  benefit  calculations.  At  present  there  is  no  law  governing\nsupplementary  nonstate  pensions;  the  passage  of  such  law  is  crucial  in  light  of  plans  being\nformulated by the NBFIs to offer voluntary retirement savings products.15\n\n                                               \n14 The  individual  contributions  will  be  determined  by  the  individual\u2019s  length  of  service  in  the  work  force,  his/her\nmonthly average wage calculated over the best five years\u2019 of earnings during a consecutive 10-year period prior\nto the establishment of the individual account on 1 January 2000, and an average index of the national average\nwage in the last five years.\n\n15  The  experience  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  (Loan  1589-KAZ:  Pension Reform Program,  for  $100  million,\napproved  on  15  December  1997)  demonstrates  the  need  to  strengthen the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  as\nwell as implement broad-ranging  capital market  reforms prior  to  embarking  on  pension  reforms. In this  regard,\nand  particularly  given the  nascent  state  of  capital  markets  in  Mongolia,  it  is  critical  to  ensure  that  the  gradual\nconversion of the individual accounts from notional to real is undertaken with due care to the investment options.\n\n\f14\n\n5.\n\nInsurance Industry\n\na.\n\nBackground\n\n50.\nThe  insurance  sector  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development.  The  state  insurance\ncompany,  Mongol  Daatgal,  was  established  in  1934,  and  has  been  wielding  significant\nmonopoly  power  in  the  industry.  The  law  governing  insurance  activities  was  enacted  only  in\n1997. At present, there are 11 insurance companies, including Mongol Daatgal, of which 9 are\nprivate.  The  Insurance  Supervision  Unit  (ISU)  of  MOF  is  responsible  for  all  policy,  legal,  and\nregulatory  activities  governing  the  insurance  industry.  ISU  has  a  staff  of  three  officers  at\npresent,  although  there  are  provisions  under  the  law  for  the  establishment  of  aimag-level\ninsurance  supervision  offices.  ISU\u2019s  operational  and  regulatory  capacities  need  to  be\nsignificantly strengthened to help develop contractual savings institutions in Mongolia.\n\nb.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\nMongolia has an underdeveloped insurance sector.  While  there  has been  long  history\n51.\nwith  insurance  products,  the  growth  of  industry  is  affected  by  low  level  of  incomes,  lack  of\nawareness  of  public  to  the  significance  and  benefits  of  insurance  sector,    and    lack  of\noperational  and  regulatory  capacity  in  the  industry.  Besides  considerable  regulatory  support,\npolicy  and  operational  assistance  is  needed.  There  are  no  prudential  requirements  governing\nsolvency  in  the  industry  at  present,  barring  minimum  capital  requirements  of  Tug100  million\n($95,000).  Investment guidelines for  insurance  companies need  to  be  strengthened  as  capital\nmarkets gradually develop in the country.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n52.\nAs the lead coordinator of the financial sector thematic group, IDA has supported BOM\nto  develop  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  and  a  medium-term  strategy  for  the  financial\nsector.  The objective of the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  to  double  the  size  of  the  sector\n(assets as a percentage of GDP) in 10 years by ensuring the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(v)\n\nThe  role  of  the  state  will  be  directed  to  ensuring  macroeconomic  and  financial\nsector stability; the state will intervene only in circumstances when market forces\npatently fail to work.\n\nThere  is  an  effective,  autonomous  central  bank  and  a  legal  framework  that\nrequires good prudential regulation, corporate governance, and  supervision and\nprompt  corrective  action  (i.e.,  the  closure  of  banks  when  the  capital  adequacy\nratio declines below a certain minimum level).\n\nA relatively small number of sound and efficient domestic and foreign banks will\nemerge  and  will  be  capable  of  providing  efficient  banking  services  in  a\ncompetitive environment.\n\n(iv)\n\nOwnership of all commercial banks will be transferred to the private sector.\n\nBasic  payment  and  banking  services  are  available  to  meet  demand  outside  of\nUlaanbaatar  through  a  variety  of  channels  (e.g.,  microfinance  institutions,\nregional cooperatives, private banks).\n\n\f(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\n15\n\nThe financial sector will have a cadre of banking and related personnel trained in\ninternational best practices.\n\nThe  legal  environment  for  conducting  financial  activities  and  accounting\nstandards  will  be  rigorously  enforced,  with  the  aim  of  strengthening  public\nconfidence in financial institutions.\n\nThere  is  a  growing  number  of  NBFIs  (e.g.,  finance  and  leasing  companies,\ncontractual  savings  institutions,  cooperatives,  and  microfinance  companies)  to\nhelp meet the demand for savings and investment.\n\n(ix)\n\nA  healthy  and  well-governed  capital  market  will  be  developed  to  complement\nbanking.\n\nTo implement this long-term vision effectively, the Government has adopted a medium-\n\n53.\nterm strategy for the financial sector to\n\nestablish  the  foundations  of  a  market-based  financial  system,  including  the\ndevelopment of modern banking skills, enhancement of auditing and accounting\nstandards, enforcement of financial contracts, and establishment of an exit policy\nfor troubled banks;\n\nsignal  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  uphold  rights  and  obligations  under\nfinancial  contracts,  beginning  with  the  timely  servicing  of  interest  payments  on\nGovernment bonds held by banks;\n\nreduce the pervasive role of the state in allocating financial resources\u2014until the\nrevocation of the licenses in December 1999 of the deeply insolvent BITI and RB,\nGovernment-controlled banks accounted for about 90 percent of the assets in the\nbanking system;\n\nfacilitate  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  financial  institutions  to  provide\npayment  systems  and  banking  services  appropriate  to  conditions  existing  in  the\nsparsely populated country;\n\nprompt  the  consolidation  of  the  banking  system  by  doubling  the  minimum  capital\nrequirement of banks to Tug2 billion (about $1.9 million);\n\nstrengthen the legal framework for effective supervision and regulation by the central\nbank, including the requirement for prompt corrective action;\n\n(vii)\n\ndevelop a resolution and liquidation framework for failed banks;\n\nprovide the foundations for the development of a market for Government bonds and\nan interbank market;\n\nstrengthen  corporate  governance  in  the  financial  sector  by  encouraging  banks  to\nfollow  international  standards,  such  as  the  guidelines  on  corporate  governance  in\nbanking institutions issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS);\n\n(x)\n\nfoster  a  healthy  capital  market  by  carrying  out  reforms  in  the  MSE  and  MSEC  to\nenhance investor confidence; and\n\n\f16\n\n(xi)\n\ninstitute a regulatory mechanism to guide the development of the NBF sector.\n\nADB\u2019s  FSP  II  and  IDA\u2019s  FSAC  are  critical  components  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\n\n54.\nFSRP, and help implement the Medium-Term Financial Sector Development Strategy.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n55.\nMongolia has received significant support from external financiers to develop its financial\nsector.    In  the  past,  ADB  has  played  a  lead  role  in  the  financial  sector.  It  has  provided  total\nassistance of $35 million for the  FSP; nine TA grants for banking for $3.7 million; a TA loan of\n$3 million for upgrading banking skills, which is still ongoing; and three TAs for capital markets\nfor $300,000.\n\nIMF  has  in  place  a  three-year  arrangement  under  the  poverty  reduction  growth  facility\n56.\n(PRGF) formerly ESAF for SDR33.4 million. The second annual arrangement under the PRGF for\nSDR14.8 million was approved in June 1999. The first review under the second arrangement was\ncompleted  by  the  Board  in  January  2000,  and  performance  was  rated  satisfactory.  First  quarter\n2000, macroeconomic data suggest that macroeconomic performance is good, however, the impact\nof the Zud will place added pressure on the macroeconomic program for the remainder of the year\nand  the  Government  may  need  to  take  corrective  actions  to  meet  the  financing  requirements\nresulting  from  the  Zud.  At  the  time  of  printing  the  review  of  the  second  arrangement  of  PRGF  is\nunder way. The second annual component of the PRGF included financial sector reforms focusing\nin particular on bank restructuring activities that built upon the work undertaken by the FSP. Under\nthe program of reforms, two banks have been closed and are under liquidation, and a third is under\nreceivership  and  being  restructured  for  the  purpose  of  privatization.  The  IMF  program  has  also\nsupported continued fiscal consolidation and strengthening of tax administration, budget control, and\nmanagement.\n\nIDA  is  supporting  the  development  of  Mongolia\u2019s  private  enterprise  and  financial  sectors\n57.\nunder  a  private  sector  development  credit  ($12 million)  approved  in  May  1999.  This  credit  line  is\nchanneled through TDB and Golomt Bank. Through the FSAC,  IDA is sharing the financing of the\nFSRP with ADB (para. 6).\n\n58.\nThe  TA program of USAID has provided bank restructuring experts for AB, BITI, and  RB,\nsupported  the  financial  audits  of  these  banks,  and  helped  with  the  technical  work  for  privatizing\nTDB. USAID has also funded a TA project for pension reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and\nlegal  building  blocks  to  develop  the  pension  system  in  Mongolia;  it  is  to  be  completed  in  2000.\nAssistance has also been provided to support the development of a microcredit institution. Finally,\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  has  supported  the  strengthening  of  AB,  and  Japan\nBank for International Cooperation has provided a number of advisers to support strengthening of\nrural  credit,  payment  systems,  and  commercial  banking.  Details  on  external  assistance  for  the\nfinancial sector is provided in Supplementary Appendix F.\n\n59.\nADB  envisages  involvement  in  three  sector  lending  operations  that  support  the  financial\nsector.  These  include  the  proposed  (i)  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (2000),  (ii) Rural\nFinance Project (2001),16 and (iii) Housing Sector Finance Project (2001). During the processing of\nthe FSP II, activities have been coordinated and efforts made to reinforce possible policy actions to\ncomplement  these  projects.  Another  ADB  project,  the  Social  Safety  Net  Development  Program\n\n                                               \n16  An improved supervisory and regulatory framework for SCCs supported by the FSP II will promote an enabling\nenvironment for the development of SCCs expanding the outreach of financial services throughout the country,\nand which is expected to set the groundwork for the Rural Finance Project.\n\n\f17\n\n(SSNDP) (2000), will address social concerns by supporting the development of a social safety net,\nthrough  unemployment  insurance  and  disability  protection.  Pension  systems  will  not  be  included\nunder the SSNDP. ADB has been in policy discussions with SSIGO and USAID for some time on\nstrengthening financial management of the pension system and improving financial sustainability of\nthe  pension  scheme.    In  view  of  the  increasing  unfunded  liabilities  in  the  pension  system,  these\naspects  will  take  priority  over  extending  additional  benefits  under  the  system  for  the  present.\nAccordingly,  and  in  view  of  ADB\u2019s  increasing  focus  on  building-in  social  concerns  in  pension\noperations, this division of responsibilities between the SSNDP and the FSP II (i.e., pension system\nreforms will be addressed under the FSP II) is considered justified and effective.  Coordination of\nactivities between these two projects will continue in the future.\n\n60.\nIn 1999, to ensure  effective donor  coordination  in  the financial  sector,  the  Government\ninvited funding  bodies  to form  a thematic group  and prepare  the financial  sector  strategy  with\nsupport  of  the  World  Bank.  The  financial  sector  strategy  lays  down  the  long-term  vision  and\nmedium-term strategy for financial sector development. Drawing from this, the Government has\nworked closely with ADB and IDA to develop the FSRP (para. 6). ADB and IDA will launch joint\nperiodic monitoring of the FSRP, and the two institutions will closely consult with each other on\nthe  performance  of  their  respective  FSP  II  and  FSAC  programs  prior  to  tranche  releases  to\nachieve  common  evaluation  of  overall  FSRP  implementation.  This  will  be  reflected  in  the\nmemorandum of understanding to be entered into by both institutions.\n\nD.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nCountry  Operational Strategy\n\n61.\nThe main objective of the country operational strategy is to foster economic growth and\nreduce  poverty  by  (i)  focusing  on  income  and  employment  generation  through  private  sector\ndevelopment, and (ii) promoting good governance as an overarching economywide objective for\nthe  strategy.  The  strategy  identifies  five  core  sectors  including  the  financial  sector,  for  ADB\nsupport. The strengthening of financial sector would help (i) remove the fragility of the banking\nsystem  to  facilitate  growth  of  private  sector  investment  and  savings,  and  (ii)  develop\nmicrofinance  schemes.  Special  emphasis  will  be  on  governance  reforms  within  the  sector  to\nintroduce  greater  transparency  and  accountability  at  all  levels  of  financial  institutions  and\noperations. The financial sector strategy will support  poverty  reduction primarily  by  developing\nmicrofinance services and promoting private sector-led economic growth.\n\n2.\n\nADB\u2019s Program Lending Performance\n\n62.\nSince Mongolia joined ADB in 1991, ADB has provided support for most sectors of the\neconomy.  Despite economic  uncertainty,  fiscal  constraints,  and  institutional  weaknesses  in  all\nsectors, ADB\u2019s portfolio in Mongolia is, in general, performing satisfactorily and implementation\nis proceeding on schedule. A high proportion of ADB lending has been through program loans\n(28.6 percent by number and  32 percent  by amount)  in  view  of  the need  to  support  structural\nadjustment.  Release  of  the  second  tranches  of  program  loans  in  the  finance,  industry,\nagriculture,  and  education  sectors  has  been  generally  on  track  which  demonstrates  the\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  and  capacity  to  implement  complex policy and  sector  reforms  in  a\ndifficult domestic and international environment.\n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy\n\n63.\nADB  has  been  supporting  financial  sector  reforms  in  Mongolia  since  1991.  The\nemphasis  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  has  been  to  help  Mongolia  move  from  a  monobanking\n\n\f18\n\nsystem characteristic of centrally planned economies to a modern two-tier banking system. The\ntechnical support provided has helped establish a conducive legal and  regulatory environment\nto facilitate the development of a market-based and commercially oriented banking system. This\nhas involved strengthening the Banking Law, developing the framework for banking supervision\nand  prudential  regulations,  and  providing  institutional  development  for  BOM  and  selected\ncommercial  banks  through  training  and  skills  development.  Although,  the  supporting  financial\ninfrastructure is evolving, the banking system is under severe stress. External factors, such as\n(i)  political  instability  and  related  difficulties  in  ensuring  consensus  on  the  implementation  of\ndifficult policy decisions, such as bank closures; and  (ii) recurrent  supply-side  shocks  (i.e., the\nAsian  and  Russian  crises)  that  have  induced  losses  in  the  corporate  sector  have  added\npressure on the fragile banking system. Internal problems, including (i) weak governance of the\nfinancial sector; (ii) lack of experienced and well-trained staff to manage banks effectively, from\nsenior  management  to  credit  officers;  and  (iii)  limited  enforcement  capacity  at  BOM  and  its\ninability  to  the  arrest  the  loan  default  culture17  have  led  until  recently  to  increasing\nnonperforming  loans  and  a  decline  in  performance  of  banks.  These  factors  have  adversely\naffected asset quality and contributed to erosion of confidence in the banking system.\n\n64.\nKeeping  these  issues  in  view,  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  strategy  in  Mongolia  aims  to\ndevelop  a  balanced,  competitive,  viable,  and  stable  financial  system  by  broadening  and\ndeepening  financial  reforms  to  improve  efficiency  in  the  intermediation  process.  ADB\u2019s\noperational strategy allows for broad-ranging support for the financial sector by\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nstrengthening financial sector policies and regulations;\nimproving  financial  sector  governance  by  introducing  greater  transparency  and\naccountability  at  all  levels  of  operations,  including  appropriate  checks  and\nbalances  to  effectively  prevent  abuses  by  shareholders  and  directors,  and\nstrengthening market discipline;\nrestructuring and privatizing banks to consolidate and develop reputable and role\nmodel financial institutions;\ndeveloping  equity  and  debt  markets,  reforming  the  pension  system,  and\nsupporting  the  development  of  finance,  financial \ninsurance\ncompanies;\nextending credit by developing onlending operations for small and medium-sized\nenterprises, rural enterprises, households,  microfinance, and  housing  purposes;\nand\nstrengthening  the  efficiency  and  the  outreach  of  financial  intermediation  to\nsupport stable economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\nleasing,  and \n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n V. \n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n65.\nThe deficiencies of the financial system have potentially affected Mongolia\u2019s growth and\nmacroeconomic prospects. The banking crises have raised the cost of financial intermediation,\nwiped  out  public  savings,  and  imposed  a  heavy  burden  on  the  budget  and  the  economy\nbecause of the significant financial costs to restructure commercial banks. The development of\na  sound,  efficient,  and  well-regulated  financial  system  that  is  market  based  is  fundamental  to\n(i) achieve  higher  and  sustainable  growth  and  help  meet  the  country\u2019s  social  and  economic\ndevelopment  objectives,  particularly  reduction  of  poverty,  as  well  as  (ii)  develop  a  robust\n\n                                               \n17  The  default  culture  reflects  the  prevailing  incentives  system  that,  given  weak  prudential  regulations  and\n\nenforcement capabilities and lack of market discipline, perpetuates moral hazard.\n\n\f19\n\nfinancial sector with institutions that can withstand the challenges of exogenous shocks to which\nMongolia  is  vulnerable.  A  consolidated,  resilient,  and  commercially  viable  banking  system  is\ncrucial to inducing efficiency in financial intermediation.  During the first phase of financial sector\nreforms  (1997  to  1999),  the  Government  adopted  bold  policy  measures  to  address  banking\nproblems.  These  included  (i) strengthening  the  prudential  regulations,  including  raising  the\ncapital  adequacy of banks;  (ii) developing the  legal framework  to  allow  for  bank  bankruptcies,\ni.e.,  conservatorship  and  receivership  of  banks;  (iii)  closing  eight  insolvent  banks;  and\n(iv) enhancing the drive for loan recovery.\n\nDespite  these  measures,  the  banking  system  is  small  and  weak18  with  12  licensed\n66.\nbanks accounting for about $180 million of aggregate assets. The banks\u2019 distress19 has posed\nproblems  of  financial  intermediation  with  supply  of  credit20  falling  below  requirements.  Banks\nhave  been  primarily  lending  short-term  at  relatively  large  interest  spreads,21  and  have  rolled\nover these loans that has resulted in maturity mismatch in the system. Past practices of directed\nlending,  reinforced  by  a  pervasive  loan  default  culture,  have  resulted  in  accumulation  of\nnonperforming  assets  (equivalent  to  37  percent  of  the  loan  portfolio).  Delays  in  Government\ninterest  payments  on  bank  restructuring  bonds  to  banks  have,  in  turn,  aggravated  cash-flow\nproblems  and  placed  further  stress  on  bank  balance  sheets  and  solvency.  Furthermore,  the\nbanking  system  has  had  to  absorb  the  adverse  supply-side  shocks  due  to  loan  defaults  that\nresulted from a significant fall in commodity prices and exports, thus worsening asset quality in\nthe banking system.\n\n67. While strengthening banking as the primary institution for deposit and lending activities is\na  priority  for  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  development  strategy,  sole  dependence  on  it\nresulted  in  stress  and  overextension  of  banks.  The  stock  market  is  small  and  illiquid,  and  the\npension  and  insurance  systems  have  played  a  limited  role  in  terms  of  developing  alternative\nsources  of  funds  to  finance  economic  growth.  The  Government  has  given  priority  to  the\ndevelopment  of  the  capital  market  and  contractual  savings  institutions  for  diversifying  the\nfinancial sector.\n\n68.\nThe  equity  markets  remain  at  an  early  stage  of  development,  and  have  received  little\nexternal assistance since ADB first  supported  the  creation of  the  MSE  in 1991.  Strengthening\nthe equities  market  will  enhance domestic  resource  mobilization and  complement  the banking\nsystem  in  developing  long-term  sources  of  funding  for  investment  projects.  Broadening  and\ndeepening  the  MSE  and  improving  its  regulation  would  generate  greater  confidence  in  the\nmarket  and  facilitate  the  supply  of  tradable  securities  primarily  through  the  privatization  of\nSOEs.  This,  in  turn,  would  stimulate  greater  demand  from  investors  seeking  better  quality\nstocks.\n\n69. While  the  contractual  savings  reform  measures  that  were  initiated  in  1995  have\nimproved the financial health of the system to some extent, several of problems still exist, as in\nmany  of  the  other  transition  economies.  These  include  (i)  large  deficits  and  long-run  funding\n\n                                               \n18  The  ratio  of  bank  assets  to  GDP  has  been  falling  over  the  past  three  years  and  stands  at  approximately\n\n20 percent.\n\n19  The three problem banks, namely AB, BITI and RB accounted for 56 percent of nonperforming loans in the banking\nsystem by late 1999. With ADB support, the three banks were placed under receivership in late 1999 and BOM has\ncommenced liquidation procedures at BITI and RB, a significant step in restructuring the banking system.\n\n20  M2 to GDP, an indicator of credit in the economy stands at 19 percent in 1999 down from 24 percent in  1995.\nDuring this period, currency to M2 (or the inverse of the money multiplier) has increased from 24 percent to 30\npercent. Ninety-five percent of total loans have maturities of less than one year.\nInterest spreads on local currency lending deposit range on average between 20 and 25 percent annually.\n\n21 \n\n\f20\n\ndifficulties as a result of the generous benefit structure; (ii) contribution arrears, particularly from\nSOEs,  due  partly  to  enforcement  problems  and  partly  to  poor  SOE  financial  health;\n(iii) inadequate coverage, given the difficulties of collecting pension contributions from  informal\nsector workers and herders;  (iv)  significant underreporting  of  income for pension  contributions\nand the absence of a link between pension contributions and receipts as benefits are based on\nthe last five years\u2019  of  earnings; and  (v)  the  narrow  and  declining  base  of  pension  contributors\nrelative to recipients.\n\n70.\nThe  development  of  the  capital  markets  and  contractual  savings  are  important  to\nenhance domestic resource mobilization, increase the supply of long-term sources of financing,\nand  deepen  financial  markets.  In  recent  years,  the  number  of  credit  cooperatives  and  new\nfinance companies has increased. To lay the foundation for development of the NBF sector, the\nGovernment  plans  to  develop  a  proper  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  supervision\nframework for stable growth of the equity markets, and pension and insurance systems. These\nreforms  will  complement  banking  reforms  with  the  objective  of  supporting  balanced  financial\nsector development as set forth in the Government\u2019s medium-term financial sector development\nstrategy. The Government has developed the FSRP, which consists of the FSAC and the FSP II\nto support the implementation of the strategy.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n71.\nThe primary goal of the FSP II is to promote the  development  of  a  competitive,  stable,\nand  broad-based financial  system  to  support enhanced  resource  mobilization  and  sustainable\neconomic growth. The FSP II will focus on the following activities:\n\n(i) \n\nImprove financial intermediation processes by\n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n(d)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nstrengthening corporate governance of the banks in line with international\nbest practices;\nimproving  the  loan  collateral  system  by  allowing  for  different  types  of\nproperty  over  which  a  security  interest  can  be  created,  and  improving\nprocedures to allow for proper and easy registration and valuation of the\nproperty;\nimplementing a management information system (MIS) for the banks; and\ndeveloping interbank markets.\n\n(ii)\n\nStrengthen  prudential  regulations  and  supervisory  framework  for  the  NBF\nsubsector by\n\nto  comply  with  risk-based  prudential\n\nrequiring  finance  companies \nregulations;\nissuing accounting standards for NBFIs;\nrestructuring  the Supervision  Department  of  BOM  to  improve  monitoring\nand enforcement of regulation of NBFIs; and\nenacting amendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other required\nlegislation  to  vest  BOM  with  oversight  responsibility  over  savings  and\ncredit cooperatives through second- and higher-tier credit associations.\n\n(iii) \n\nDevelop capital market infrastructure by\n\n(a)\n\nseparating  and  privatizing  the  MSE,  Central  Depository  System  (CDS),\nand Securities Clearing System (SCS);\n\n\f(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\n21\n\nstrengthening operational and regulatory capacity at MSE;\nstrengthening the Securities Law; and\npreparing a law on trusts and a law on investment funds.\n\n(iv)\n\nDevelop the pension system by\n\ntransforming the current system to a partially funded system;\nimproving the administrative processes in SSIGO, including developing its\ncapabilities  for  pension  payment  collection,  and  strengthening  financial\nmanagement of the pension system; and\nintroducing legislation to allow for the nonstate voluntary  pension system.\n\n(v)\n\nStrengthen the legal and regulatory reforms of the insurance system by\n\nincreasing minimum capital requirements for the insurance industry;\npromoting liberal investment guidelines; and\nincreasing premium incomes.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nThe policy  matrix for  the  FSRP  (Appendix 1)  provides for  actions  envisaged under  the\n72.\nFSAC and FSP II. In the case of the FSP II, the policy framework (Appendix 2) includes 4 prior\nactions, 13 conditions tied to the release of second tranche, and 21  other  policy  actions  to  be\ncompleted over a three-year period.\n\n1.\n\nReform the Banking System\n\n73.\nThe FSAC will focus on bank restructuring measures at AB and SB, as well as measures\nto  (i)  strengthen  the  bank  regulatory  framework  including  asset  classification,  bank  licensing\nrequirements, bank exit strategy, and bank privatization (with a possible equity stake by ADB\u2019s\nprivate  sector  group);  (ii)  strengthen  banking  institutions,  namely  the  Mongolian  Asset\nRestructuring Agency and the Credit Information Bureau; and (iii) support capacity building and\nskills  upgrading  through  a  TA  credit.  The  banking  reforms  under  the  FSP  II  will  complement\nbanking  reforms  under  the  FSAC.  These  combined  policy  actions  are  expected  to  develop  a\nbroad  framework  for  the  creation  of  a  stable  and  competitive  banking  system.  This  is  an\nimportant  focus  and  agenda  of  the  FSAC  and  builds  on  the  progress  made  under  past  ADB\noperations.22  To  facilitate  coordination,  ADB  and  IDA  will  jointly  monitor  implementation\nprogress within FSRP (para. 57). The salient features of the FSRP and the synopsis of banking\nsystem reform measures envisaged under the FSRP banking-focused actions are presented in\nSupplementary Appendixes G and H.\n\n74.\nTo support sustainability of the bank  restructuring  program,  the  FSP  II  aims  to  support\ndevelopment  of  (i)  sound  governance  policies  and  structure,  (ii)  the  regulatory  framework  for\nloan  collateral,  (iii)  MIS  for  the  banks,  and  (iv)  interbank  markets.  These  policy  measures\nreinforce the FSAC policy framework.\n\n                                               \n22  The  development  of  the  financial  sector  in  Mongolia  as  identified  in  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  and\nmedium-term  strategy,  while  not  focusing  on  the  sequential  aspects  of  reforms,  recognizes  the  importance  of\ndeveloping a core banking system as a first priority to be complemented and succeeded by reforms focusing on\nthe  development  of  (i)  the  NBF  sector  including  capital  markets  and  NBFIs;  and  (ii)  contractual  savings\ninstitutions.\n\n\f22\n\na. \n\nStrengthen Corporate Governance in Banking Institutions\n\n75.\nTraditionally, state-owned banks operating under the old  monobanking  system focused\non providing directed lending mandated by the planning authority. Management of banks had to\nbe  subservient  to  political  goals,  as  decisions  were  subject  to  political  interference.  Private\nsector investments in banks  will  only  be forthcoming  if banks are generally viable entities and\nare able to generate returns on equity. The governance structure in private  banks  is  critical to\nensure that these banks do not serve the personal ends of their owners (i.e., financing owners\u2019\nbusiness activities). The limited liability nature of banking institutions together with the absence\nof effective accountability and internal controls means there is a high risk that bad management\npractices will be perpetuated  to the detriment of the development of sound and efficient private\nbanks.  Unless  sound  corporate  governance  is  in  place,  banking  supervision  cannot  function\neffectively.\n\n76.\nThe  FSP  II  will  support  the  preparation  of  guidelines  on  best  practices  on  corporate\ngovernance  of  commercial  banks.  The  FSP  II  involves  strengthening  the  commercial  banks\nsupervisory boards and internal control mechanisms in line with the report of Basle Committee\non  Banking  Supervision  on  Enhancing  Corporate  Governance  for  Banking  Organizations.\nTransparency  of  banking  system  reporting  mechanisms  will  be  improved  based  on  the  IMF\nCode  of  Good  Practices  on  Transparency  in  Monetary  and  Financial  Policies. The  associated\nTA will help develop a model charter for banks, and guidelines to encourage banks to prepare\nor amend their charters based on this model. Adoption of these policy measures by commercial\nbanks will help strengthen internal controls, and establish appropriate levels of accountability to\nfoster checks and balances.\n\nb.\n\nImprove Loan Collateral\n\n77.\nThe  lack of  collateral and  uncertainty  concerning  the  registered  value  of  the  collateral,\nand  the ability to  recover  the  loan  by  enforcing  the  security  have  posed  serious  problems  for\nfinancial  intermediation  and  added  to  the  cost  of  borrowing.  The  expected  approval  later  this\nyear  of  amendments  in  the  Civil  Code  to  allow  for  movable  property  to  be  offered  as  loan\ncollateral  will  ease  the  constraints  facing  borrowers  and  the  banks.  However,  the  types  of\nproperty  over  which  a  security  interest  can  be  created  must  be  further  expanded,  and\nprocedures  for  registering  property  improved  to  allow  for  proper  and  easier  registration  and\nvaluation of the property. The FSP II will support the preparation of a plan  acceptable  to ADB\nidentifying the types of property that can be used as collateral.\n\nc.\n\nImplement an MIS in Banks\n\n78.\nThe existing MIS of the commercial banks is rudimentary and provides limited scope for\nproper  treasury  management,  foreign  exchange  operations,  and  other  activities.  The  current\nchart  of  accounts  for  banks  separates  loans  and  deposits  by  a  combination  of  counterpart\nobligations  (state,  private,  etc.),  currency,  and  classification  (past  due,  substandard,  doubtful,\nand loss) categories.  This reflects the limitations of a manual statistical system. An automated\nsystem  would  limit  segregation  at  the  general  ledger  level  to  the  generic  nature  of  the\ntransaction  with  all  counterpart  and  condition  segmentation  done  at  the  loan  subsystem  level\nand with reporting on the portfolio coming from the subsystem, not the general ledger level.\n\nSix pilot banks have reached an agreement with BOM to develop and implement a MIS\n79.\nsoftware for these banks on a cost-sharing basis. The adoption of this software is expected to\nbe fully functional at TDB by the end of 2000, and will be installed in the remaining pilot banks in\n2001.  The  MIS  software  is  expected  to  strengthen  the  bank\u2019s  commercial  orientation  by\n\n\f23\n\nimproving  banking  operations,  as  well  as  strengthening  reporting  requirements  to  enhance\nbanking supervision by BOM.\n\nd.\n\nDevelop an Interbank Market\n\nThere is no functioning interbank market in Mongolia.  As financial markets develop, they\n80.\ngain  breadth,  as  a  wider  range  of  instruments  is  available,  and  depth  as  the  market  volume\nincreases, thereby increasing liquidity of the markets. The development of the interbank market\nis a necessary step in the evolution of a well-balanced financial sector. The monetary authorities\nhave  a  role  in  promoting  interbank  market.  An  interbank  market  would  provide  banks  with\nopportunities to invest funds, improve asset liability management, and reduce costs of funding\nthereby improving the profitability of banks.\n\nThe development of a more fluid interbank market, including the formation of a variable\n81.\ninterbank  rate,  would  provide  a  market  signal  on  premiums  associated  with  high  risks.  This\nwould  serve  to  enhance  market  discipline  in  the  banking  system.  Under  the  FSP  II,    BOM  in\nassociation  with  MOF  will  prepare  a  plan  focusing  on  the  prerequisites  for  developing  an\ninterbank  market.  The  plan  will  include  the  formulation  of  a  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional\nframework  to develop an interbank market.\n\n2.\n\nStrengthen Prudential Regulations and Supervision of NBFIs\n\nto  be \n\nintroduced, \n\n82.\nIn view of the limited outreach of the banking system, finance companies are expected\nto assume a greater role in financial intermediation in Mongolia (para. 28). Over the past years,\nBOM  has  licensed  four  non-deposit-taking  finance  companies  and  21  credit  cooperatives.\nAppropriate  mechanisms  need \nlicensing\nrequirements,  risk-based  prudential  standards,  minimum  paid-in  capital  to  ensure  a  healthy\nnonbank  financial  system,  and  accounting  standards  for  the  NBFIs.  The  Supervision\nDepartment of BOM must also be properly organized to ensure effective supervision of NBFIs.\nUnder  the  FSP  II,  BOM  will  (i)  strengthen  NBFI  regulations  requiring  finance  companies  to\ncomply  with  risk-based  prudential  regulations;  (ii) issue  accounting  standards  for  NBFIs;\n(iii) restructure the Supervision Department of BOM to monitor and enforce  NBFIs  regulations;\nand (iv) enact amendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other legislation to vest BOM\nwith oversight responsibility over savings and credit cooperatives through  second- and  higher-\ntier credit associations.\n\nregulations  on \n\nincluding \n\n3.\n\nDevelop Capital Market Infrastructure\n\na.\n\nSeparate and Privatize the MSE, CDS, and SCS\n\nThe  MSE  is  state-owned  and  operates  as  a  self-regulatory  organization  under  the\n83.\ngeneral oversight of MSEC.  In  addition,  the  CDS and  SCS  are  part of the  MSE  with  common\nstaff.  This  affects  the  governance  structure  of  securities  markets,  results  in  diffuse  lines  of\nresponsibility, and limits the possibility of checks and balances within the system. In addition, it\ncan result in a  potential  conflict  of  interest  of  senior  staff  and  management.  To address  these\nconcerns, the FSP II will focus on assessing the feasibility and preparing a plan, acceptable to\nADB, to separate the MSE as a legal entity, and the CDS and SCS as one or two separate legal\nentities,  with  the  objective  of  facilitating  their  eventual  privatization.  Privatization  of  the  MSE,\nCDS, and SCS is a condition for program completion.\n\n\f24\n\nb.\n\nStrengthen Operational and Regulatory Capacity at MSEC\n\n84.\nMSEC  needs  a  major  overhaul,  and  more  and  technically  stronger  staff  if  it  is  to\neffectively carry out its supervisory and regulatory functions. The failing confidence in the equity\nmarkets  partly  reflects  the  institutional  and  resource  constraints  at  MSEC.  The  FSP  II  will\nsupport  the  strengthening  of  MSEC  through  the  TA  (paras.  110-113)  to  develop  operational,\nmanagement, administrative, and other relevant institutional strengthening measures.\n\n85.\nSimilarly,  the  FSP  II  will  foster  improved  governance  in  the  equity  markets.  This  will\nprimarily involve improving regulations to ensure that all trades are undertaken at MSE through\naccredited traders and as such reduce the scope for illicit trading. In addition, under FSP II and\nto  strengthen \nthe  association  of  brokers,  dealers,  and  subbrokers,  minimum  capital\nrequirements  of  security  firms  will  be  doubled  from  Tug10  to  Tug20  million.  This  will  be\ncomplemented by measures to strengthen accountability and transparency through regulations\non  insider  trading  and  development  of  a  code  of  ethics  and  guidelines  for  MSEC  and  MSE\nemployees.\n\nc. \n\nStrengthen the Securities Law\n\n86.\nFor  the  securities  market  to  function  effectively  and  to  complement  the  eventual\nprivatization of the MSE, the Securities Law must be strengthened. FSP II will support efforts to\nstrengthen:  (i)  MSEC\u2019s  capacity  as  the  regulatory  body  in  charge  of  the  securities  markets;\n(ii) transparency of securities trading and disclosure requirements, and enforcement provisions;\nand \nin  particular  strengthening  minority\nshareholders\u2019  rights,  and  having  stricter  auditing  requirements  for  companies  to  be  listed  and\nbroader  representation  among  MSEC  members.  To  improve  confidence  in  the  MSE,\nenforcement of listing requirements will be strengthened and greater penalties will be applied for\nbreach of rules.\n\nimprovement  of  corporate  governance, \n\n(iii) \n\nd.\n\nPrepare Law on Trusts and a Law on Investment Funds\n\n87.\nThe legal framework for the development of the securities market needs strengthening.\nTo  create  a  proper  environment  for  the  development  of  the  securities  market  and  thereby\nenhance  domestic  resource  mobilization  including  through  the  participation  of  institutional\ninvestors,  the  FSP  II  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  law  on  trusts  and  a  law  on  investment\nfunds. The  preparation and  subsequent approval  of  these  two  important  laws  are  expected  to\nstrengthen demand in the equity markets and improve domestic, and in the longer run, external\nresource mobilization as mutual funds and other investment funds develop.\n\n4.\n\n Strengthen the Pension System\n\na.\n\nDevelop a Partially Funded System\n\n88. While the new system will enable pension payments to be closely linked to contributions,\nthe  pension  fund  will  be  unfunded  for  the  near  future.  The  Government  intends  to  introduce\npartial  funding  gradually  from  2005.  However,  this  is  not  mandated  in  the  law  and  no  sound\nactuarial analysis has been undertaken to make an informed decision about the timing. Further,\nthere  is  no  legal  and  regulatory  framework  to  govern  the  introduction  of  partial  funding  or  on\ninvestments of the accumulated pensions in securities. There are concerns that the introduction\nof partial funding may be delayed or may not be successful unless the Government\u2019s efforts are\nsupported  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  areas.  The  FSP  II  aims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\nefforts  in  formulating  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  partial  funding.  TA\n\n\f25\n\nsupport (paras. 110-113) will also be provided to  undertake new actuarial projections  to  guide\nthe timing of phasing-in of the partial funding.\n\nb.\n\nImprove the Administrative Processes in SSIGO\n\nTo facilitate the introduction of partial funding of the pension system, the administrative\n89.\ncapacity of SSIGO needs considerable strengthening. In particular, SSIGO must develop a plan\nspecifying  the  administrative  and  regulatory  aspects  involved  in  managing  a  partially  funded\nsystem. Ad hoc changes to pensions, in the absence of an indexation mechanism, such as the\nrecent  Government  announcement  to  increase  pensions  in  order  to  equalize  the  benefits\nbetween the pre- and post-1995 retirees, result in administrative complexities in the process of\nbenefit  calculations.  Under  the  FSP  II,  the  Government  will  undertake  several  measures  to\nstrengthen  its  administrative  capacity  and  processes  to  facilitate  the  change  to  a  notional\ndefined  contributory  system,  and  to  improve  pension  collections.  As  part  of  the  FSP  II,  TA\nsupport will also be provided for the introduction of pension indexation.\n\nSSIGO has thus far only been a collection agency, without any role in long-term financial\n90.\nmanagement  or  investments.  As  the  Government  moves  toward  partial  funding,  proper\ninvestment  guidelines  and  regulations  need  to  be  drafted.  As  part  of  the  legal  and  regulatory\nframework  supported  under  the  FSP  II,  the  financial  management  and  investment  capacity  in\nthe pension system will be enhanced.\n\nc.\n\nDevelop Non-State Voluntary Pensions\n\nTo  minimize  the  burden  on  the  pay-as-you-go  system,  as  well  as  to  provide  for\n91.\nsupplementary  budgets  to  the  elderly,  the  Government  plans  to  introduce  non-state  voluntary\npensions to supplement the  current  \u201cfirst  pillar\u201d  pension  provisions.  There  is  currently no  legal\nand regulatory framework governing supplementary non-state pensions. Such a law is critical to\nsupport the eventual development of voluntary retirement savings options. Under the FSP II, the\nGovernment  will  prepare  draft  legislation  to  facilitate  the  development  of  a  voluntary  private\npension system.\n\n5.\n\nStrengthen the Insurance System\n\n92. While Mongolia has a long history with insurance products, there is a lack of operational\nand  regulatory  capacity  in  the  industry.  Besides  considerable  regulatory  support,  policy  and\noperational  assistance  is  needed  to  strengthen  the  system.  There  are  no  prudential\nrequirements  governing  solvency  in  the  industry  at  present,  barring  minimum  capital\nrequirements of Tug100 million  ($95,000).  Under  the  FSP  II,  the Government  will  submit draft\namendments  to  the  Law  on  Insurance  to  Parliament  for  approval.  The  amendments  will\n(i) introduce  risk-based  solvency  requirements  in  the  industry,  (ii)  strengthen  the  minimum\ncapital requirements, and (iii) increase the percentage of premium incomes that can be invested\nby the insurance companies. Support will also be provided to the  ISU  to  develop  and adopt  a\nsound regulatory framework with adequate guidelines and  standards,  reporting  and disclosure\nrequirements,  accounting,  auditing  and  prudential  norms,  investment  guidelines,  and  other\nconditions in accordance with international best practices.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n93. \nThe  FSP  II  is  expected  to  have  an  impact on facilitating  resource  mobilization  through\nthe  private banking  system, capital  markets,  and  the public finance  sector.  It  will  increase  the\nefficiency  of  resource  allocation,  thereby  increasing  economic  activity  and  benefiting  all\n\n\f26\n\nelements of society including the poor and near poor. Appendix 4 presents the Poverty Impact\nAssessment for the FSP II. Through the banking system and capital markets, the FSP II is also\nexpected  to  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  growth  and  employment  by  reducing  intermediation\ncosts,  and  in  time,  reducing  the  cost  of  capital  for  businesses.  It  will  also  encourage  direct\nprivate participation in economic activity.\n\n94.\nThe development of an interbank market will facilitate the  use of  monetary  instruments\nand improve liquidity management of banks. The capital markets component of the FSP  II  will\nstrengthen  the  operations  of  the  stock  exchange,  improve  investor  confidence,  and  promote\nmarket  trading.  In  addition,  through  legal  reform,  the  FSP  II  will  facilitate  development  of  an\ninvestor base, which currently is nonexistent. Under the FSP II, development of the contractual\nsavings  institutions  will  foster  mechanisms  to  ensure  a  timely  transition  to  a  partially  funded\nsystem,  reducing  unfunded  liabilities  and  fiscal  pressures  in  the  medium  term.  The  improved\nperformance of the pension and insurance system  will  enhance  savings  and  the availability of\nproductive resources to enhance investments.\n\nThe FSP II is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.\n\n95. \nIts environmental impact is expected to be minimal.\n\n VI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\nA.\n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\n96.\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR11,448,000  ($15  million  equivalent)\nfrom its Special Fund resources for the FSP II. The loan amount for the FSP II was determined\non  the  basis  of  the  strategic  significance  of  the  financial  sector  and  the  costs  of  structural\nreforms under the FSRP. The latter are estimated at $100 million equivalent,23 and will consist\nof the following components:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nbank  restructuring,  including  liquidation,  restructuring,  recapitalization,  and\nsettlement of severance payments ($51 million equivalent);\ntransition to a partially funded pension system ($28 million equivalent);\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  BOM,  Mongolian  Asset  Restructuring  Agency,\nMSEC, SSIGO, and ISU ($13 million equivalent); and\nothers  including  privatization  of  MSE,  MIS  development,  and  liberalizing\nguidelines for pension and insurance funds ($8 million equivalent).\n\nB.\n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n97.\nThe Borrower will be Mongolia, and the loan will have a 24-year maturity, including an 8-\nyear grace period. The loan will carry an annual interest charge of 1  percent during  the  grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent during the amortization period.\n\n98.\nThe  loan  will  be  utilized  within  36  months  commencing  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness.  The  loan proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within  180\ndays prior to the date of effectiveness.\n\n                                               \n23  ADB\u2019s $15 million  loan  will  cover  the  costs of  adjustment  under  the  FSRP,  which is  estimated  at  $100 million.\nThe IDA loan is $32 million equivalent (for three years) to support a balance of payments financing gap of $30\nmillion over the  next  two years.   The  financing  gap for  the  third  year  could be  an  additional  $15 million  (these\nfigures do not reflect the increase in the financing requirements resulting from the Zud).\n\n\f27\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n99.\nBOM will be the Executing Agency for the FSP II, and will have overall responsibility for\nthe  program  implementation,  including  the  administration  and  disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of quarterly progress reports on program\nimplementation.  These  reports  will  include,  progress  made,  problems  encountered,  remedial\nactions  taken  during  the  previous  quarter,  and  proposed  program  activities  and  expected\nprogress during the next quarter.\n\n2.\n\nSteering Committee\n\n100. A steering committee has been established to oversee implementation of the FSP II. The\ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOM  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives  from  MOF,  MSEC,  MSE,  SSIGO,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  State  Property\nCommittee. The steering committee will meet at least once  every  three  months  to  ensure  that\nthe proposed reforms are undertaken in accordance with the agreed timetable, all as set forth in\nthe list  of  actions  to be taken during the  FSP  II.  An adequately  staffed program  implementing\nunit has also been established within BOM to oversee day-to-day program implementation.\n\nD.\n\nProcurement\n\n101.\nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for\nprogram  loans,24  procurement  of  goods  and  services  produced  in  and  originating  in  ADB\nmember countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency in accordance\nwith  standard  public  sector  procedures  in  Mongolia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial\npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  the  case  of  goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international\ncommodity markets, procurement will be undertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate\nto the trade and acceptable to ADB.\n\nE.\n\nDisbursement\n\n102.\nThe proceeds of the FSP II loan will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to\na negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 5). Disbursement of loan proceeds will be permitted\non the  basis of a  certification provided  by  the  Borrower  confirming  that  in  each  year  in  which\nproceeds of the FSP II are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports\nfrom nonmember countries, (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports financed  under  other  official\ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during\nthe year.\n\nF.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n103.\nThe policy framework for the FSP II includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be\nused  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  under  the  FSP  II.  Any  counterpart  funds  not\nrequired will be used first to finance the local currency costs of other projects financed by ADB,\nand second for general development purposes.\n\n                                               \n24  R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.\n\n\fG.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n28\n\n104.\nThe loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche will be $5 million equivalent,\nand  the  second  tranche  will  be  $10  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has  complied  with  a\nnumber  of  up-front  policy  actions  and  the  first  tranche  can  be  released  as  soon  as  the  Loan\nAgreement becomes effective. These actions include (i) understandings on the financial sector\nstrategy;  (ii)  issuance  of  risk-based  prudential  regulations  to  govern  licensing  of  finance\ncompanies, and guidelines for the calculation of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios and foreign\nexchange exposure for finance companies; (iii) restructuring and strengthening the Supervision\nDepartment  of  BOM  to  monitor  and  enforce  prudential  regulations  for  banks,  finance\ncompanies,  and  financial  leasing  companies;  and  (iv) submission,  to  Parliament  for  approval,\ndraft amendments to the Securities Law to enhance transparency for all trades in the securities\nmarket. ADB has been heavily  involved  in  the policy dialogue  supporting  these  actions.  Since\nFSP II is a part of the FSRP, the timely meeting of ADB\u2019s up-front policy actions and IDA\u2019s first\ntranche release conditions is a strong signal of the Government\u2019s commitment to carry forward\nthe  reform  program  of  FSP  II.  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  December\n2001, but this will be dependent upon satisfactory implementation of the FSP II, in particular, the\nfulfillment of all conditions for release of the second tranche set forth  in  the policy  matrix.  The\nrelease of the second tranche has been synchronized with the release of the second tranche of\nFSAC, which is also a two-tranched loan.\n\n105.\n\nFor release of the second tranche, the following 13 actions will have to be satisfied:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nBOM will prepare and issue guidelines on best practices in corporate governance\nin  banking  institutions,  including  measures  to  strengthen  internal  control\nmechanisms, based on international  practices  such as  the guidelines  issued by\nBIS.\n\nMOF  and  BOM  will  prepare  a  plan  acceptable  to  ADB  for  development  of  an\ninterbank  market, \nlegal,  regulatory,  and\ninstitutional framework.\n\nincluding  establishment  of \n\nthe \n\nThe  Government  will  prepare  a  plan  acceptable  to  ADB  on  the  expansion  of\ntypes of property that can be used as loan collateral.\n\nProgress  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  achieved  in  implementing  the  program  to\nintroduce  and  operationalize  integrated  banking  MIS  software  in  the  Mongolian\nbanks participating in such program.\n\nAmendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other necessary legislation will\nbe  enacted  to  provide  for  the  regulation  of  second-  and  higher-tier  credit\nassociations by BOM.\n\n(vi)  MSE  and  MSEC  will  increase  the  minimum  capital  requirements  for  securities\n\nbrokers and dealers to at least Tug20 million.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  submit  a  draft  law  on  trusts  acceptable  to  ADB  to\nParliament for approval.\n\n(viii)  The Government will submit a draft law on investment funds acceptable to ADB\n\nto Parliament for approval.\n\n\f29\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government will prepare a plan acceptable to ADB to establish the MSE as\na  separate  legal  entity,  and  the  CDS  and  SCS  as  a  separate  legal  entity  or\nentities with each entity having separate financial and accounting records and no\nMSE officials on its staff, for their eventual privatization.\n\nMSEC  in  collaboration  with  the  MSE  will  develop  a  marketing  and  public\nawareness campaign to increase public knowledge of equity markets.\n\nThe  Government  will  submit  to  Parliament,  for  approval,  a  draft  amended  and\nrestated Securities Law acceptable  to  ADB,  with  provisions  to  improve financial\ngovernance  (including  protection  of  minority  shareholder  rights,  increased\npenalties  for  Securities  Law  violations,  stricter  auditing  requirements  for\ncompanies  to  be  listed,  and  broader  representation  of  MSEC  members)  in  line\nwith international best practices.\n\n(xii) \n\nSSIGO will prepare a plan, acceptable to ADB, for introducing partial funding of\nthe pension system.\n\n(xiii)  MOF will draft and submit  to  Parliament, for approval,  draft amendments  to  the\nLaw  on  Insurance  to  (i)  introduce  risk-based  solvency  requirements  in  the\nindustry, (ii) strengthen  the  minimum  capital  requirements,  and  (iii)  increase  the\npercentage  of  premium  incomes  that  can  be  invested  by  the  insurance\ncompanies in the securities market.\n\nThe Government must comply with an additional 21 monitorable actions during the FSP\n106.\nII  period.  Government  assurances  have  been  sought  in  the  Loan  Agreement  for  fulfillment  of\nthese policy actions. (A list of these monitorable actions are presented in Appendix 2).\n\n107. ADB will, in cooperation with BOM, carry out semiannual reviews of progress in program\nimplementation,  and  will  assess  its  impact  on  the financial  and other  sectors  of  the  economy.\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with the World\nBank  Group  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  that  have  implications  for\nprogram implementation, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting\npolicy proposals.\n\n108.\nIn addition to the  semiannual progress  reports, BOM  will  submit a  program  completion\nreport to ADB within three months of the end of the program period. This report will evaluate the\nimplementation  of  the policy  reform  measures under  the  FSP  II,  their  impact  on  the  economy\nand  the  financial  sector,  lessons  learned  during  the  program  period,  and  further  reforms  and\nassistance needed for the sector development.\n\nH.\n\nCoordination with IDA\n\n109. Because  the  FSP  II  and  IDA's  FSAC  support  components  under  the  Government's\noverall FSRP, coordination between ADB and IDA in implementing the FSP II and FSAC will be\ncritical to the success of the FSRP.  In this regard, ADB and IDA are finalizing a memorandum\nof  understanding,  that  details  the  coordination  arrangements  between  the  two  institutions.\nAmong other things, ADB and IDA will be required to promptly inform the other of any event that\nmay  interfere  with,  or  hinder  or  impair  the  implementation  of  the  FSRP,  or  that  may  interfere\nwith Mongolia\u2019s performance of its obligations under its loan agreement with ADB or IDA. Joint\nsupervision missions will be undertaken, in particular, prior to release of the FSP II and FSAC\nsecond  tranches.  While  release  of  the  second  tranches  of  the  FSP  II  and  FSAC  have  been\n\n\f30\n\nsynchronized to take place in December 2001, there are no common conditions between ADB\nand IDA for release of the first or second tranches of the FSP II and FSAC; tranche release will\nbe at the sole discretion of the relevant lender under its respective loan agreement. There is no\ncross-default provision in the ADB or IDA loan agreement.\n\n VII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n110.\nThe proposed TA, Strengthening Financial Sector Development, is an integral part of the\nFSP  II  as  it  will  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  more  competitive,  stable,  and  broad-\nbased  financial  system  by  increasing  the  efficiency  of  financial  intermediation  and  supporting\nthe development of financial infrastructure. The TA will strengthen (i) the supervisory framework\nfor  NBFIs  (2  person-months);  (ii)  the  framework  for  secured  collateral  (2  person-month);\n(iii) legal,  regulatory, and  institutional framework for developing  the  capital  markets  (8  person-\nmonths);  and  (iv)  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  developing  contractual\nsavings institutions (6 person-months). Appendix 6 presents the detailed terms of reference.\n\n111.  An  international  consulting firm  with  relevant  experience  in banking and  capital  market\ndevelopment in association  with domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged to provide the  services\nrequired.  The  TA  will  involve  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  10 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  using  the  simplified\ntechnical proposal format in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n112.\nThe TA is estimated to cost $730,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost of\n$580,000 and local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to\nfinance $600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $20,000 equivalent\nof  the  local  currency  cost.    The  TA  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-\nfunded  TA  Program.  The  Government  will  provide  $130,000  equivalent  through  in  kind\ncontributions of counterpart staff, office facilities, and logistical support. Appendix 7 presents the\ncost estimates and financing plan for the TA.\n\n113.  The  TA  will  be  executed by BOM.  BOM  will  form  a  coordinating  committee,  which  will\nhave  representatives  from  MOF,  MSEC,  MSE,  and  SSIGO.  The  TA  is  expected  to  start  in\nSeptember 2000 and be completed by March 2001.\n\n VIII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\n114. Mongolia\u2019s  impaired  financial  system  is  potentially  the  most  significant  constraint  to\nstable  economic  growth  and  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development\nobjectives, particularly, poverty reduction. The beneficial impacts on poverty associated with the\nFSP II can be summarized as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nStrengthening  the  prudential  and  supervisory  framework  for  SCCs  and  finance\ncompanies is expected to strengthen the development of sound and viable SCCs\nand improve access to credit by the more vulnerable and poorer segments of the\npopulation.\n\nStrengthening the banking system will render banks more resilient and will avoid\ndisruptions to the banking system from external shocks, which undermine growth\nprospects, wipe out savings, and lead to significant fiscal restructuring costs.\n\n\f31\n\n(iii)\n\nA  consolidated,  restructured,  and  well-regulated  banking  system  will  (a)  on  the\nexpenditure side, free-up public sector resources to invest in productive activities\nsuch  as  infrastructure  or  social  sectors  (i.e.,  health  and  education),  which  may\notherwise have been reallocated to bank restructuring or recapitalization; and (b)\non the revenue side, relax credit constraints and strengthen credit to the private\nsector,  expanding  GDP  growth  and  with  it,  the  taxable  revenue  base  to  meet\nsocial safety net and other social expenditure needs to minimize vulnerability of\nthe poor segment of the population.\n\n115.\nThe financial sector reforms under the FSP II are necessary to ensure a stable, viable,\nand competitive financial system based on improved asset quality in the banking system, and a\nmore  efficient  banking  intermediation  process\u2014all  key  elements  in  restoring  credit  in  the\ndomestic  economy.  Development  of  the  capital  markets  and  long-term  contractual  savings\ninstitutions  will  entail  the  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  necessary  to  ensure  domestic\nresource  mobilization  including  long-term  sources  of  investment  funds  to  complement  the\nlending channels intermediated through the banking system. The reforms subscribed under FSP\nII are expected to have a positive impact on savings and investment in the economy.\n\n116.\nThe  adjustment  costs  resulting  from  the  liquidation  of  BITI  and  RB,  as  well  as  the\ndownsizing  of  AB,  will  have  some  short-  to  medium-term  adverse  effects  reflecting  loss  of\nemployment (initially estimated at 1,000 staff). However, on the one hand, as employees in the\nbanking  system  are  younger  and  generally  better  trained,  they  are  more  flexible  and  better\nsuited  to  find  new  employment  opportunities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Program  is  expected  to\nlead to the growth of the NBF sector and newly established finance companies and other NBFIs\nwhich will likely absorb retrenched staff from closed down banks. Accordingly, the net impact on\npoverty is likely to be small.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n117.\nThe  principal  risk  lies  in  the  timing  of  the  proposed  FSP  II.  The  FSP  II  loan  will  be\npresented for Board consideration just prior to a Parliamentary election. It is expected that the\nFSP II will be ratified by the  current  Parliament  (within  July).  However,  if  this  Parliament  does\nnot  ratify  the  FSP  II,  then  the  new  Parliament  may  need  additional  lead  time  before  final\nratification. This concern is  considered  manageable  in view of  the  nature of  the  policy  actions\nproposed under the FSP II, which have support from the various political groups.\n\n118. A second risk is that, typical of policy reform programs, the Government may be unable\nto  implement  the  required  policy  measures  because  of  resistance  or  lack  of  cooperation  by\ninvolved parties such as the Parliament with respect to legal amendments, privatization of MSE\nand  other  policy  actions.  In addition,  there  may  be  risks associated  with  weak  capacity  at  the\nagency  level,  the  ability  to  recruit  and  retain  qualified  cadres  especially  at  MSEC,  and  poor\ncoordination between financial sector institutions.\n\nTo the extent that most of the reform measures are standard actions needed to foster an\n119.\nenabling  environment  for  financial  sector  development,  there  should  be  limited  risks  of\nunsatisfactory  compliance  with  the  policy  actions.  To  reduce  the  downside  risks  from  weak\ncapacity,  TA  is being provided  to  key  agencies\u2014BOM,  MOF,  MSEC,  SSIGO\u2014for  institutional\nupgrading.  Policy  coordination  will  be  assisted  by  the  formation  of  a  high-level  steering\ncommittee and a program implementation unit.\n\n\f32\n\n IX. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n120.\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  second  tranche  conditions  set  forth  in  the\npolicy  matrix,  and  the other actions under  the  FSP  II,  the  Government  has  assured  ADB  that\n(i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as described\nin the development policy letter, will continue in effect for the duration of the FSP II period; and\n(ii) the Government will adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the FSP II\nas specified in the development policy letter and/or the Loan Agreement, and ensure that such\npolicies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program period.\n\n X. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n121.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 11,448,000 to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program, with\na term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of\n1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum  thereafter, and  such\nother  terms  and  conditions as are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n\n1 June 2000\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 1\n\nLetter of Development Policy\nLong-Term Vision, Medium-Term Strategy and Policies for the Financial Sector Reform Program\n\nUlaanbatar, May 10, 2000\nMONGOLIA\n\nMr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n0401 Metro Manila\nPhilippines\n\nDear Mr. Chino:\n\nSubject: Proposed the Financial Sector Reform Program\n\n1.\nThe  Government  is  pleased  to  request  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  International\nDevelopment  Association  (IDA)  to  jointly  finance  the  financial  sector  reform  program  for  Mongolia.  We  are\nhappy that both institutions are coordinating their efforts to support the program. This is an excellent example of\ndonor  coordination  and  partnership.  The  comprehensive  approach  to  developing  the  financial  sector  that\nencompasses both banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, involving other donors  such  as  USAID,  JICA,\nGTZ, is an extremely positive development for Mongolia. The fact that we are writing a joint letter attached with\na  joint  policy  matrix  to  the  presidents  of  the  two  international  financial  institutions  bears  testimony  that  we\nwelcome close donor coordination in the financial sector. We have sent the same letter to President Wolfensohn\nof the IDA.\n\nBackground\n\n2.\nA  decade  ago  this  past  December  10,  1999,  Mongolia  embarked  on  a  radical  and  comprehensive\nreform path\u2014indeed, the path we choose entailed nothing less than abrupt systemic change encompassing all\nspheres  of  the  nation\u2019s  political,  economic  and  social life.  If  one  compares  our  situation  today  with  that  at  the\nend of 1989, one finds that while Mongolia still faces many daunting challenges, we have made great strides in\nreshaping our lives and our destiny for the better.\n\n3.\nToday, all citizens of Mongolia have the right and the opportunity to set their own goals, and to choose\nfreely how best to accomplish these goals. Freedom of choice is perhaps the most priceless achievement of this\nremarkable decade in Mongolian history.\n\n4.\nIn 1990, Mongolia held its first free elections. These were an embodiment of the notion of pluralism and\nresulted in the formation of a new Cabinet from three different political parties, through which the  basis  for  the\nensuing  comprehensive  reforms  of  Mongolian  society  was  established.  Subsequently,  under  the  1992\nConstitution,  Mongolia  has  held  two  free  and  democratic  parliamentary  elections,  as  well  as  two  presidential\nelections. New political parties have emerged, and the oldest one has evolved into a new democratic force.\n\nThe  transformation  of  the  economy  has  been  equally  dramatic.  The  reforms  launched  by  the  first\n5.\ndemocratic  government  in  1990-1992,  including  price  liberalization,  establishment  of  a  new  banking  and\nfinancial  system,  and  privatization,  laid  the  foundation  for  the  development  of  a  private,  market  economy  in\nMongolia.  The  sweeping  transformation  of  the  economy  which  has  taken  place  in  this  decade  was  a  direct\noutcome of those first reforms.\n\n6.\nThe majority of the Mongolian people have come to comprehend in a relatively short period of time the\nnecessity of relying on their own visions, abilities and drive to meet the challenges of the new era. At the same\ntime, this decade has seen the emergence of new social problems such as unemployment and poverty. These\nwere  the  inevitable  result  of  the  withdrawal  of  the  large  external  subsidies  which  had  previously  financed  the\noperations of the entire Mongolian economy and social services to the tune of more than 30% of our GDP, and\nof  the  collapse  of  COMECON  trading  block.  No  country  could  endure  or  has  endured  such  a  dramatic  shock\nwithout experiencing a period of hardship. It is precisely for this reason that Mongolia has embarked on a path of\ndrastic institutional and structural reforms in all spheres of the economy, and intends to continue on this path in\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 2\n\nthe future. Our national program of institutional, structural and policy reform is aimed at reducing the hardships\nof the transitional period, overcoming this period in the shortest time possible, and creating a solid foundation for\nthe future development of an efficient economy and the progressive advancement of our society.\n\n7.\nSubstantial  progress  already  has  been  achieved  on  the  economic  front.  Mongolia  has  had  five\nconsecutive years  of  economic  growth,  and  the  economy  expanded  again, by  3.3%, in  1999  despite  a  further\npronounced  deterioration in  our terms  of trade. Inflation  has  been  brought  down  to  single  digits.  The livestock\nsector, the backbone of the Mongolian economy, has been privatized, and dynamic private companies also are\noperating  in  many  other  key  sectors  of  the  economy.  A  thriving  small  business  sector  is  generating  jobs  and\nincomes  for  large  numbers  of  our  people.  The  November  1999  employment  report  shows  that  open\nunemployment has dropped below 6% of the labor force. This is suggestive of the underlying dynamism of our\neconomy\u2014an economy whose structure is on the way to being rebuilt, in the course of a decade.\n\n8.\nAt  the  same  time,  many  serious  challenges  remain  to  be  overcome.  The  external  environment  has\nturned  extremely  unfavorable, leading to  excessive  trade  and  budget  imbalances  and  a  sharp  deterioration  in\nthe  banking  system  which must  and  are  being  addressed  through  painful  adjustment measures.  The  need  for\npolicies  which  will  achieve  more  rapid  economic  growth  and  improvement  in  the  living  standards  of  the\nMongolian people in the face of such a difficult environment is urgent, and that is we why have acted to take the\nmeasures  needed  to  both  minimize  the  costs  of  our  adjustment  to  the  huge  external  shock,  and  to  lay  the\nfoundation for more rapid economic growth in the future. And we have done this despite an unfortunate cycle of\npolitical turmoil during 1998 and 1999. The banking sector is still very weak and unable to play its proper role in\npromoting economic  growth.  Some  important  sectors  of the  economy  are  still  predominantly  state-owned,  and\nothers, although privatized, are still not competitive and generating growth. The Government itself, which must\nlead the national process of transition to a more productive and efficient society and economy, has  undergone\nrelatively less structural change. Mongolia has barely begun to address the question of how to deliver necessary\nsocial services to its population without the large external subsidies which had previously financed them.\n\n9.\nWe  are  very  fortunate  in  that  we  have  many  generous  and  reliable  development  partners,  and  as\ndiscussed  at  the  Seventh  Mongolia  Assistance  chaired  by  the  World  Bank  in  June  1999,  Mongolia  needs  a\ntransitory increase  in  donor  aid  to  enable  us  to  carry  out the  needed  measures  to  adjust  to the  huge  external\nshock\u2014a shock totaling an estimated 17% of GDP during 1998-99\u2014in a phased manner so as to avoid undue\nwelfare losses. To this end, and to support a series of reforms aimed at creating a sound and efficient financial\nsystem  needed  for  faster  economic  growth,  we  are  requesting  a  Financial  Sector  Adjustment  Credit  from  the\nIDA (the Association), in the amount of US$32 million equivalent, and a Financial Sector Reform Program Loan\nfrom the ADB in the amount of US$15 million equivalent to support the projected 2000 to mid-2003 balance of\npayments financing gap.\n\nMacroeconomic Framework\n\nTerms  of  Trade  Shocks.  The  sharp  falls  in  1998-99  in  world  prices  for  copper,  gold  and  cashmere,\n10.\nMongolia\u2019s  leading  exports,  have  caused  great  harm  to  the  Mongolian  economy.  In  1998,  export  earnings\nplunged US$150 million (or by amount equal to about 15% of  GDP),  due  entirely  to these  price  declines.  This\nled  to  a  cumulative  depreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  of  35%,  and  to  a  drop  in  official  reserves.  The  sharp\ncontraction in the value of exports due to the fall in commodity prices reduced Government revenues by almost\n4%  of  GDP  in  both  1998  and  1999,  relative  to  the  level  of  1997.  Corporate  taxes  from  the  copper  sector\ndeclined from 3% of GDP to nil in 1998, and in 1999.\n\n11.\nDue to the steep decline in world prices for copper, the Erdenet Copper Concern also has been unable\nto  settle  its  bills  with  the  Energy  Authority,  the  Oil  Importing  Company,  and  electric  power  stations,  making  it\ndifficult for  the latter  to  pay money  owed  to  the  coal  mining  companies  and  to  the  railways.  All  of  these  firms\nhave  in  turn  been  unable  to  pay  their  expected  taxes  and  dividends  to  the  state  budget.  This  created  a\ncascading of arrears in the economy, causing slowdowns in the activities of these major producers, and a large\nincrease in the Government\u2019s budget deficit\u2014from 8.6 to 11.7% of GDP from 1997 to 1998, and in the creation\nof domestic credit to finance the deficit (to 3% of GDP in  1998).  As  a  result, in  1998, the  Government fell into\narrears on payments of salaries and pensions. This external shock also contributed to a marked deterioration in\nfinancial sector performance, with non-performing loans rising to about 41% of total commercial bank loans.\n\n12.\nThe Government has acted with determination to address the imbalances caused by the terms of trade\nshock. The Value Added Tax Law was adopted and became effective on July 1, 1998. In September 1998, the\nVAT was raised from 10 to 13%, a 10% tax of the export of gold was adopted, and the excise  tax  of imported\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 3\n\npetroleum  and  petroleum  products  was  raised  by  US$7  a  ton.  In  addition,  the  1999  budget  froze  wages  and\nsalaries, and reduced outlays on goods and services.\n\nGovernment\u2019s  Fiscal  Program.  In  May  1999,  Government  adopted  a  comprehensive,  medium-term\n13.\nprogram to adjust to the impact of the terms of trade shock, including a package of measures to augment fiscal\nrevenue  by  a further  2%  of GDP  annually  and  reduce  capital  spending  and  net  lending  by  about  1%  of  GDP,\nwith the support of the second year of the PRGF Arrangement, approved  in  June  1999,  whose  first  review  we\nsuccessfully completed in  January  2000. These fiscal  measures,  coupled  with  the  1998  tax increases,  cut  the\noverall  deficit  of  the  general  Government  to  9.9%  of  GDP  in  1999,  from  11.7%  in  1998.  This  adjustment,\ntogether with higher net external financing with the support of the PRGF, reduced the Government\u2019s use of net\nbanking system credit in 1999 to less than 1% of GDP, compared to 3% of GDP in 1998. The full-year effects of\nthese tax measures, together with public administration reform and further privatization, are projected to narrow\nthe General Government\u2019s overall deficit to 7.3% of GDP in 2000, and to 5.3% by 2002, with zero net domestic\ncredit  to Government  beginning in  2000. Inflation,  which  was  brought  down  to  6%  in  1998  (from  21% in  1997\nand 45% in 1996), rose to 10% by the end of 1999 due to the impact of lagged relative price adjustments to the\nexternal shock and excessive credit extended to the Government in 1998. It is projected to decelerate to 7% in\n2000. At the end of 1999, the total General Government debt reached an estimated 78% of GDP, with external\ndebt  amounting  to  71%  of  GDP.  External  debt  service  amounted  to  less  than  6%  of  exports  of  goods  and\nnonfactor services in 1999, due to the concessional nature of that debt and the high degree of openness of the\neconomy.  During  2000-02,  the  Government\u2019s  total  debt  to  GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  increase  to  79%,  and  its\nexternal debt, to 73% of GDP. At the same time, economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4-5%.\n\nThe Budget for 2000. The Government  budget for  2000  seeks  to  consolidate fiscal  sustainability  and\n14.\nfree-up resources for the private sector. As mentioned above, the overall deficit is projected to decline to 7.3% in\n2000,  and  net  domestic  financing,  to  zero.  The  2000  budget  is  geared  to  reversing  the  recent  decline\nGovernment  revenues  relative  to  GDP,  while  reducing  Government  spending  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  and\nimproving the prioritization of public spending. Total revenue is slated to rise to 28.4% of GDP, reflecting a slight\nincrease  in  income  taxes  and  dividends  from  the  copper  sector,  and  the  full-year  effects  of  the  revenue\nmeasures introduced in 1999. Total spending is targeted to fall to  35.7%  of GDP,  compared  to  36.3% in  1999\n(and  39%  in  1998).  The  budget  makes  provisions  for  the  full  servicing  of  public  debt,  including  Government\nbonds. Outlays on goods and  services  will  be  tightly controlled  and  domestically-financed  capital  expenditures\non lower priority projects will be reduced. The Government also will be undertaking a public expenditure review,\nwith  the  support  of  IDA,  during  2000.  During  2000,  the  proposed  Financial  Sector  Adjustment  Credit  would\nassist to achieve the above macroeconomic targets.\n\nReducing  the  Size  of  the  State.  Steps  will  also  be  taken  to  focus  Government  on  core  functions,\n15.\noutsourcing other activities, and to increase its efficiency, in the context of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nsupported Governance Reform Program. Government also is taking action to improve  the  governance  of  state\nenterprises  and  curtail  their  involvement  in  activities  that  could  be  more  efficiently  carried  out  by  the  private\nsector.  To  improve  pricing  decisions,  and  allow  state  enterprises  to  operate  on  a  commercial  basis,  these\nenterprises  will  be  granted  greater  managerial  autonomy.  Regular  financial  audits  of  state  enterprises  will  be\ninstituted.  State  enterprises  will  continue to face  hard  budget  constraints  (zero  net  domestic  bank  credit),  and\nwill  not  receive  Government  transfers.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  expanded  its  privatization  program,\nwhich yielded revenues of about 1.7% of GDP in 1998, to the largest state enterprises. The National Oil Import\nConcern and  the  Gobi  Cashmere  Company  are to  be  privatized,  as  is  the Trade  and  Development Bank  (see\nalso paragraph 38 below).\n\nExchange  Rate  and  Monetary  Policy.  The  Bank  of  Mongolia  has  continued  to  pursue  the  flexible\n16.\nexchange  rate  policy  adopted  in  1993  and  effectively  implemented  in  the  last  quarter  of  1998  to  facilitate  the\nadjustment to the external shock, and will continue to do so in the future. At the end of 1999 the exchange rate\nwas about 25%  higher  than  at the  end  of the  third  quarter  of  1998, leading  to  a  depreciation  of  the  Togrog  of\nabout  4%  in  real  effective  terms.  International  reserves  also  have  substantially  recovered  from  their  1998\ndecline,  and  official  holdings  of  external  assets  reached  US$151,  or  the  equivalent  of  about  14  weeks  of\nimports, compared to less than 12 in 1998. The primary objective of monetary policy is to keep inflation in single\ndigits. With  the  deceleration  of inflation  during  1998  and  for  most  of  1999,  the  yield  on  central  bank  bills  was\nprogressively lowered, to 10% per annum. As the Government deficit is reduced, banking reforms advance and\ninflation  decelerates  during  2000,  reductions  in  commercial  bank  lending  interest  rates  should  be  feasible.\nGrowth  in  monetary  aggregates  would  reflect  increased  credit  to  the  private  sector  (with  zero  net  lending  to\nGovernment and state enterprises) and the further build-up of net external assets towards an adequate level.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 4\n\nAccelerating Economic  Growth  and  Improving  Living  Standards.  Real  GDP  growth  over  the  past\n17.\nfew years has grown at a modest pace of 3.5%. With an annual population rate of 2%, per capita GDP has also\nincreased. However, the significant deterioration in the terms of trade since the second-half of 1996 had have a\nmajor adverse impact on the purchasing power of exports, which account for about 40% of GDP, and, hence, on\nincome and living standards.\n\nManaging External Shocks. Managing external shocks has become imperative if Mongolia is going to\n18.\naccelerate  economic  growth  and  to  be  able  to  translate  greater  output  into  higher  per  capita  incomes  and\ndeclining poverty. Better management of external shocks  will lead  to  higher living  standards  by  reducing fiscal\nand  monetary  volatility,  reducing  uncertainty,  enhancing  financial  sector  performance,  and  mitigating  drastic\nswings in producer and consumer incomes. To this end, under the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit\n(FSAC),  the  Government  would  adopt  a  time-bound  action  plan,  satisfactory  to  the  Association,  to  improve\nmanagement  of  external  shocks.  It  is  envisaged  that this  action  plan  will  encompass  measures  to  smooth-out\nfiscal revenues, and measures to manage commodity price risk to shield producer incomes from the full impact\nof commodity price fluctuations. On the latter, we hope that Mongolia will qualify as an early test case under the\nWorld Bank\u2019s Commodity Initiative.\n\nCurrent Situation of the Financial Sector\n\n 19.\nThe  financial  sector  in  Mongolia  is  slowly  evolving  to  a  market-based  system,  but  is  still  not  able  to\ncontribute  to  the  development  of  the  economy,  and  has  instead  been  a  drag  on  economic  development.\nConsolidated banking sector indicators have improved in the past several months thanks to the implementation\nof  measures  taken  in  connection  with  the  1996  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL)  funded  by  ADB  and\ncontinued under the Banking Restructuring Action Plan of 1999 and the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment\nCredit  to  be  funded  by  the  Association.  Currently  the  banking  sector  also  meets  the  international  criteria  for\ncapital  adequacy  (10%)  and  liquidity  (18%).  The  financial  sector,  however,  remains  weak  and  financial\nintermediation continues to be severely constrained. Building on ADB\u2019s assistance under the FSPL in support of\nbank restructuring, further restructuring is needed to support the development of viable core private banks.\n\n 20.\nAt end-1999, total bank assets amounted to only 18 percent of GDP, while total credit outstanding to the\nprivate  sector  was  only  about  5  percent  of GDP.  Four  large  banks  out  of  12  currently  licensed  banks  hold  80\npercent  of total  assets  of  the  banking  system. The  Savings  Bank,  one  of  the  largest  banks,  does  not  perform\nany  financial  intermediation  functions.  The  remaining  8  banks  have  only  negligible  market  shares,  have  little\ncapacity  to  compete  with the largest  4  banks,  and  conduct  limited financial intermediation  activities.  The  state\ndirectly  and indirectly  owns  shares  of  6  banks.  These  include  controlling  shareholding  of  3  banks  (Trade  and\nDevelopment Bank, Savings Bank and Agriculture Bank), which together account for 70 percent of total assets\nof the banking system.\n\n 21.\nNon-bank financial institutions are at an incipient stage of development. The stock market is small and\nilliquid;  and  market-based  insurance  and  leasing  businesses  are  only  beginning  to  emerge.  Nevertheless,\nconsiderable potential exists for development of non-bank financial institutions as a competing force, provided a\nsuitable legal environment is created. Currently, long-term credit exists only in the following two forms: through\nproject financing from some commercial banks that serve  as  on-lenders  of  credit  extended  to  the Government\nby donors, or through establishing relationships with foreign banks and markets.\n\n22.\nThe  financial  sector  has  recently  witnessed  the  expansion  of  credit  cooperatives  and  micro  finance\ncompanies. These institutions are expected to play a greater role as effective providers of small credit. Finance\ncompanies  and  financial  leasing  companies  are  also  beginning  to  emerge.  In  line  with  development  of  these\nnon-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the Government is committed to providing  a  suitable  legal  environment\nincluding improving supervisory and regulatory oversight of these institutions by BOM .\n \n\n 23.\nDuring the last 10 years the Government of Mongolia has taken an important series of actions aimed at\nestablishing a market-based banking system, its restructuring and development. Mongolia replaced the one-tier\nbanking  system  by  a  two-tier  one;  put in  place the foundations  of the legal framework  for  banking  operations;\nlicensed  private  banks;  and  liberalized  interest  rates  and  capital  flows,  with  the  assistance  of  the  donor\ncommunity.  Since  1996,  a  series  of  actions  have  been  taken  to  further  modernize  banking  legislation,\nstrengthen prudential norms and bank supervision, and to restructure the banking sector.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 5\n\n 24.\nAlthough  policies  on  banking  sector  reforms,  restructuring  and  liberalization  of  financial  transactions\nhave  been  broadly  moving  in  the  right  direction,  the  banking  sector  has  faced  several  crises  on  its  transition\npath (1994, 1996, 1998-1999).\n\n 25.\nDespite  these  efforts,  the  banking  sector  remains  small,  weak  and  crisis-prone.  It  is  still  necessary  to\nconsiderably  improve  banking  staff  skills  and  capacity,  as  well  as  the  legal  and  operational  environment  for\nconducting banking activities.\n\n 26.\nReal lending interest rates are extremely high. Despite the deceleration of inflation to single digits, and\nsubsequent reduction in Central Bank bill rates and deposit rates, lending interest rates remain high in both real\nand  nominal  terms.  This  has  adversely  impacted  financial  intermediation  and  the  entire  economy.  The  main\nreasons  for  high  lending  interest  rates  are:  the  high  level  of  non-performing  loans;  expectations  of  currency\ndevaluation  resulting from the  terms  of  trade  shock;  little  competition  in  the  financial  sector;  weak  institutional\ncapacity  and  failure  of  the  Government  to  make  timely  payments  on  its  financial  obligations.  High  lending\ninterest rates in turn contribute to deterioration of loan quality.\n\n 27.\nIn 1996, the Government issued bonds in an amount equivalent to 5 percent of GDP to protect deposits\nof customers of two insolvent banks, within the framework of the banking sector restructuring program. Of these\nbonds,  60  percent  is  owned  by  the  Savings  Bank,  and  40  percent  is  owned  by  the  Central  Bank.  The\nGovernment  has failed to make  timely  payments  of  interest  on  these  bonds.  Moreover, these  bonds  have  not\nhad clearly defined terms and maturities. The fact that the Government has failed to meet its obligations on its\nbonds on a timely basis is contributing to deterioration of the financial position and efficient decision-making of\nbond-holders, and is sending an improper message to the general economy by exercising an unhealthy practice\nof not meeting contract obligations.\n\n 28.\nThe  rural  payments  system  has  had  significant,  recurring  problems  due  to  strained  state  and  local\ngovernment budgets and lack of creditworthiness of the Agriculture Bank, virtually the only bank servicing rural\nareas.  This  bank  is  currently  operating  under  the  receivership  of  the  Central  Bank  and  is  undertaking\nrestructuring actions such as renewal of service fees on a contract basis, reduction of operational costs and loan\nrecovery efforts. Currently, operations of the bank are restricted to providing payments of pensions and benefits\nas well as salaries of government employees in rural areas. Micro-lending institutions in rural areas have been\nestablished only recently in three Aimags, and have not started operating at the soum level.\n\n 29.\nThe  capital  markets  and  contractual  savings  institutions  in  Mongolia  are  at  a  nascent  stage  of\ndevelopment.  The  stock  market  is  small  and  illiquid;  and  the  pension  and  insurance  systems  have  played  a\nlimited role in terms of developing alternative sources of funds to finance economic growth. Despite the smaller\nsize  of  the  capital  markets  in  relation  to  the  banking  sector,  the  Government  recognizes  the  increasing\nimportance of capital markets in developing the financial sector in Mongolia.\n\n 30.\nMarket  capitalization  at  the  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  as  of  December  1999  was  $32  million,  or\n3 percent of GDP, down from $53 million at the end of 1997. Trading activity has declined sharply over the last\nyear, as evidenced by the drop in average daily trading from $50,000 in 1998 to about $10,000 in 1999.\n\n 31.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  the  small  corporate  sector  and  slow  progress  with  regard  to  the\nprivatization of the remaining 95 SOEs, the largest of which are likely to be sold to strategic investors outside of\nthe MSE, has constrained the supply of better quality stock. On the demand side, limited capacity of MSEC to\nserve  as  an  effective  policymaker  and  regulator  has  dampened  investor  confidence  and  necessitates\nconsiderable institutional strengthening.\n\n 32.\nThe Government is  aware  that  the  1997  Insolvency  Law  has  seldom  been  applied in the  resolution  of\ncorporate  bankruptcies.  Under  the  IDA-assisted  Beltac  Project  and the  IDA  IDF Grant for  the  Insolvency  Law,\nthe Government is undertaking measures to strengthen the knowledge and application of the Insolvency Law by\ncreditors.  These  measures  will  help  improve  overall  corporate  governance  and  accelerate  resolution  of  non-\nperforming  loans  in  the  banking  sector  and  debt  recovery.  With  respect  to  financial  governance,  Mongolia  is\nunique  in  that  its  stock  exchange  is  owned  by  the  Government,  and  we  are  strongly  committed  to  its\nprivatization.\n\n 33.\nThe capital markets would further benefit from the development of the pension system. The Mongolian\npension  system  is  a  pay-as-you-go  system  where  current  work  force  pay  for  the  retired  workers.  Like  other\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 6\n\ntransition economies,  the  pension  system  has  been  afflicted  by  (i)  growing  unfunded  liabilities;  (ii)  contribution\narrears,  particularly  from  state-owned  bodies;  and  (iii)  a  narrow  base  of  pension  contributions  relative  to\nrecipients.\n\n 34.\nTo  address  these  issues,  Government  pension  plan  aims  to  introduce  notionally  defined  individual\npension accounts. In this regard, the Law on Individual Pension Accounts was adopted by the Parliament on 11\nJune 1999, under which workers born after 1 January 1960 will be given individual pension accounts indicating\ntheir  past  pension  contributions  with  effect  from  1 January  2000.  The  annual  \u201creturns\u201d  to  the  individual\ncontributions  will  be  determined  by  the  Social  Security  Insurance  General  Office.  While  the  new  system  will\nenable  pension  payments  to  be  closely  linked  to  contributions,  the  pension  fund  will  be  unfunded  for  the\nforeseeable  future,  although  the  Government  has  plans  to  invest  a  part  of  the  contributions  of  the  younger\nworkers in the domestic capital markets. The Government also plans to introduce non-state voluntary pensions\nin Mongolia, to supplement the current \u201cfirst pillar\u201d pension provisions.\n\n The  Government  will  be  preparing  draft  legislation  to  allow  the  development  of  a  voluntary  private  pension\nsystem.\n\n 35.\nWhile Mongolia has a long history with insurance products, there is a lack of operational and regulatory\ncapacity in the industry. Besides considerable regulatory support, policy and operational assistance is needed to\nstrengthen  the  sector.  Except  for  minimum  capital  requirements  of  Tug.  100  million  ($95,000),  there  are  no\nprudential  requirements  governing  solvency  in  the  industry  at  present.  Investment  guidelines  for  insurance\ncompanies need to be strengthened as capital markets gradually develop in the country.\n\n 36.\nAlthough  the recent  policy  on  financial  sector  restructuring  and  actions  taken  to  implement  this  policy\nhave generally been moving in the right direction, it is necessary to take decisive actions to make fundamental\nchanges  in  the  current  weak  situation,  to  restore  public  confidence,  and  to  establish  a  strong  financial  sector\ncapable of supporting economic development.\n\nWith  these  objectives  in  mind,  the  Long-term  Vision  and  the  Medium-term  Strategy  necessary  to\n 37.\nimplement this long-term vision for the development of financial sector is formulated below, and Financial Sector\nReform Program Loan. The Government and the Bank of Mongolia and would be implemented with the support\nof  the  proposed  Financial  Sector  Adjustment  Credit  consider  that  the  general  policy  guidelines  and  specific\nactions  to  be  taken  to  implement  the  medium-term  strategy  also  should  be  reflected  in  the  annual  Monetary\nPolicy Guidelines that are approved by Parliament at the end of each year, ensuring ownership and consensus\non the financial sector reforms as we move forward.\n\n Key Lessons Learned from past efforts to Reform the Financial Sector\n\n 38.\nThe following lessons from the experience of last  10  years  of financial  sector  restructuring  were  taken\ninto  consideration  in  determining  the  long-term  vision  and  medium  term  strategy  for  financial  sector\ndevelopment:\n\nIt is necessary to build the infrastructure aimed at supporting a market-based financial system,\n\nFinancial  sector  restructuring  will  not  be  successful  unless  the  sequence  of  reforms  is\n\nThe  financial  sector  will  not  develop  without  a  state  that  supports  contract  enforcement,\n\n\u2022 \nwith strong financial discipline and prudential controls.\n\u2022 \nprotection and securitization of private property.\n\u2022 \ndetermined correctly and a stable political environment exists.\n\u2022 \nfinancial sector.\n\u2022 \nlosses in the future.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \noperational structures aimed at strengthening the repayment culture.\n\nState  intervention  in  allocation  of  financial  resources  hinders  development  of  a  market-based\n\nThe  fact  that  the  state  recapitalizes  insolvent  banks  and  takes  their  risks  increases  potential\n\nLax entry requirements result in an excessive number of weak, poorly managed banks.\n\nA  sound  financial  sector  cannot  be  created  without  an  appropriate  legal  framework  and\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 7\n\nCapital markets and NBFIs should be developed to complement the banking sector and foster a\n\nInvestor  confidence  is  crucially  dependent  on  the  existence  of  sound  corporate  governance\n\n\u2022 \nbalanced financial structure.\n\u2022 \nsystems and practices in the financial sector.\n\n\u2022  The  role  of  the  Government  in  the  ownership  of  financial  institutions  impairs  their  rapid  growth  as  viable\nentities.\n\n Long-Term Vision for Financial Sector Development\n\nBased on the above lessons and exchange of views with key stakeholders, including members of\n\n 39.\nParliament from both sides of the aisle and donors active in the sector, the long-term vision for the financial\nsector in Mongolia for the next 10 years is envisaged as follows:\n\n\u2022  The role of the state will be directed to ensuring macroeconomic and financial sector stability, and\n\nthe state will intervene only in circumstances where market forces patently fail to work.\n\n\u2022  There  is  an  effective,  autonomous  central  bank  and  a  legal  framework  which  requires  good\nprudential regulation, corporate governance, and supervision and prompt corrective action (i.e. the\nclosure of banks when the capital adequacy ratio declines below a certain minimum level);\n\n\u2022  A relatively few number of sound and efficient domestic and foreign banks would emerge and would\n\nbe capable of providing efficient banking services in a competitive environment.\n\u2022  Ownership of all commercial banks will have been transferred to the private sector.\n\u2022  Basic payment and banking services are available to meet demand outside Ulaanbaatar through a\n\nvariety of channels (e.g., micro-finance institutions, regional cooperatives, private banks).\n\nThe  financial  sector  will  have  a  cadre  of  banking  and  related  personnel  trained  in  best\n\nThe legal environment for conducting financial activities as well as accounting standards will be\n\n\u2022 \ninternational practices.\n\u2022 \nrigorously enforced, with the aim of strengthening public confidence in the financial institutions.\n\u2022 \nThere is a growing number of NBFIs (e.g., finance and leasing companies, contractual savings\ninstitutions,  cooperatives,  and  micro-finance  companies)  to  help  meet  the  demand  for  savings  and\ninvestment.\n\u2022 \nsector.\n\nA  healthy  and  well  governed  capital  market  will  be  developed  to  complement  the  banking\n\n \n Medium-term Strategy for Financial Sector Development\n\nThe Government recognizes its Long-Term Vision will take many years to achieve. Consequently, it has\n 40.\ndevised a Medium-Term strategy that will lay the foundations necessary for achieving this vision over the longer\nterm. The key elements of the medium term strategy for financial sector development are as follows:\n\n\u2022 establish  the  foundations  for  a  market-based  financial  system,  including  the  development  of  modern\nbanking  skills,  the  enhancement  of  auditing  and  accounting  standards,  the  enforcement  of  financial\ncontracts and the establishment of an exit policy process for troubled banks;\n\n\u2022 signal  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  uphold  rights  and  obligations  under  financial  contracts,\n\nbeginning with the timely servicing of interest payments on government bonds held by banks;\n\n\u2022 reduce the pervasive role of the state in the allocation of financial resources\u2014until the revocation of the\nlicenses  in  December  2000  of  the  deeply  insolvent  ITI  and  RB  Bank,  government  controlled  banks\naccounted for about 90% of the assets in the banking system;\n\n\u2022 facilitate  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  financial  institutions  to  provide  payment  systems  and\nbanking services appropriate to conditions existing in a sparsely populated country such as Mongolia;\n\u2022 prompt  the  consolidation  of  the  banking  system  by  doubling  the  minimum  capital  requirement  to  T2\n\nbillion (about US$1.9 million);\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 8\n\n\u2022 strengthen the legal framework for effective supervision and regulation by the central bank including the\n\nrequirement for prompt corrective action;\n\n\u2022 develop a resolution and liquidation framework for failed banks;\n\u2022 provide  the  foundations  for  the  development  of  a  market  for  government  bonds  and  an  inter-bank\n\nmarket;\n\n\u2022 strengthen  corporate  governance  in  the  financial  sector  by  encouraging  banks  to  move  towards\ninternational standards such as the guidelines on corporate governance in banking institutions issued\nby the Bank for International Settlements;\n\n\u2022 foster  a  healthy  capital  market  by  carrying  out  reforms  in  MSE  and  MSEC  to  enhance  investor\n\nconfidence; and\n\n\u2022 institute a regulatory mechanism to guide the development of the NBFI sector.\n\nThe proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit and Financial Sector Reform Program would support\n41.\nthe  implementation  of  the  Governments  Medium-Term  Strategy  for  the  Reform  and  Development  of  the\nFinancial System.\n\nBank Restructuring and Privatization\n\n42.\nA largely insolvent state-owned banking system impedes .faster economic growth and improvements in\nliving  standards.    Heavy  banking  system  losses  inflate  the  public  sector  deficit  and  debt,  diverting  funds  from\npoverty reduction, human resource development and infrastructure.\n\nITI  Bank  and  Reconstruction  Bank.  On  December  24,  1999,  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  revoked  the\n43.\nlicenses,  and  initiated  a  resolution  dictating  the  liquidation  of,    ITI  Bank  and  Reconstruction  Bank.    With  this\nunprecedented measure, the size of the state banking sector was reduced by about one-fifth.\n\n44.\nAgricultural  Bank.  AB is  deeply insolvent  and incurring  operating  losses  averaging  nearly  T50  billion\nper month. At present, AB also operates the largest branch network in Mongolia and only one with a presence\ndown to the county (soum) level. The accumulated losses of AB amount to T7 billion (equivalent to about 0.7%\nof  GDP  on  a  yearly  basis).The  Government  plans  to  recapitalize,  restructure  and  eventually  privatize  AB,  in\naccordance  with  a  Restructuring  Plan  that  would  be  supplemented  in  consultation  with  IDA,  to  strengthen  its\nprovisions relating to corporate governance; commercial viability; the actions required to bring it to the point-of-\nsale; and the revocation of its license if a sound bank cannot be established. Over the medium-term, AB either\nwill  have  been  brought  to  the  point-of-sale  (to  owners  who  can  provide  appropriate  governance  and  ensure\nfinancial viability), or, if AB has become insolvent again, BOM will have revoked its license. In the meantime, the\nGovernment will begin to implement  alternative  arrangements for  ensuring  payment  services  to the  population\noutside the capital.\n\nSavings Bank. The Savings Bank was established as a special purpose vehicle to collect and  protect\n45.\nhousehold  deposits  following  the  banking  crisis  of  1996.  Savings  Bank  holds  about  one-third  of  the  banking\nsystem\u2019s  total  deposits.  The  bank  has  more  than  260,000  accounts  with  an  average  size  of  about  US$12\nequivalent  each.  The  bank  functions  essentially  as  a  Government  agency  with  an  implicit  state  deposit\nguarantee  and  lacks  a  banking/lending  culture.  The  Government\u2019s  failure,  until  recently,  to  service  the  bank\nrestructuring  bonds  that make  up virtually  all  of its  assets  resulted  in  a  deficit  cash flow  and  operating losses,\ncausing the Savings Bank to maintain higher deposit rates than otherwise would be needed, further pushing-up\neconomy-wide interest  rates.  Furthermore,  Savings  Bank\u2019s  policy  of  investing  all  its  assets  in  non-marketable\nGovernment  bonds  prevents  one-third  of  all  deposits  (representing  approximately  75%  of  all  household\ndeposits) from being intermediated.\n\n46.\nSavings  Bank  needs  to  be  made  financially  viable  to  limit  systemic  risk,  downsized  to  reduce  state\nexposure  and  foster  financial  intermediation,  and  eventually,  turned  into  a  financial  intermediary.  Therefore,\nGovernment is clearing all interest arrears on its bonds, and will service those bonds in future at an interest rate\nlinked to the BOM bill rate. Clearance of interest arrears has enabled Savings Bank to begin lowering its interest\nrates.  Over  the  medium-term,  Government  will  replace  the  stock  of  bank  restructuring  bonds  with  marketable\nsecurities  that  will  be  regularly  serviced.  In  the  meantime,  Savings  Bank  will  be  downsized,  by,  inter  alia,\nbringing  its  interest  rate  structure  in  line  with  market  rates,  and  increasing  service  fees  to  levels  charged  by\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 9\n\nother  banks.  Over  the  medium-term,  the  Government  will  prepare  an  action  plan  for  the  transformation  of\nSavings Bank into a financial intermediary, including its privatization.\n\nTrade and Development Bank. The  Trade  and  Development  Bank  (TDB) is  Mongolia\u2019s  largest  bank;\n47.\nhowever, during 1998 and the first half of 1999, the bank incurred significant loan losses from weak governance\nand poor lending practices.\n\n48.\nScarcity of modern banking skills is  severely  handicapping  development  of  a  banking  system,  and the\nfastest  way  to  develop these  skills is  through  the  training  that  a  reputable  international  bank  could  provide.  In\naddition, much greater private ownership and market allocation of resources in the financial system is needed to\naccelerate growth.\n\n49.\nAccordingly,  Government  submitted  a  bill  to  Parliament  requesting  its  approval  to  privatize  TDB  on\nJanuary  28,  2000.  Government\u2019s  intention,  once it  obtains  Parliamentary  approval  of  said  bill, is  to  privatize  a\ncontrolling share holding of TDB to a private strategic investor with recognized international banking experience\nvia  international  competitive  bidding.  The  Government  is  exploring  with  ADB  and  IFC  the  possibility  of\nparticipating, together with a private strategic investor, in the equity of the privatized TDB.\n\nCorporate Governance in Banking Institutions\n\nCorporate  governance in  banking institutions  is  generally  weak, further  undermining  market  discipline.\n 50.\nIn  many  instances,  state-owned  banks  are  operated  by  directors,  many  of  whom  were  trained  under  the  old\nsystem  based  on  principles  of  directed  lending.  To  address  some  of  these  issues,  initial  training  has  been\nprovided  under  IDA-assisted  projects  (BELTAC  and  Private  Sector  Development  Project).  On  the  other  hand,\ncertain  private  investors  are,  in  some  instances,  interested  in  establishing  small  banks  not  as  a  sound\ninvestment option but as a means to finance their personal business activities.  The closed limited-liability nature\nof banks together with the absence of effective accountability, in many cases, encourages perpetuation of bad\nmanagement further undermining the development of sound and efficient private banks. In an effort to improve\ncorporate governance and strengthen internal control mechanisms in banks, BOM will, with technical assistance\nto  be  provided  by  ADB,  prepare  and  issues  guidelines  on  best  practices  in  corporate  governance  in  banking\ninstitutions,  based  on  international  best  practices  such  as  the  guidelines  issued  by  the  Bank  for  International\nSettlements.\n\nLoan Collateral\n\n51.\nIt is recognized that the expected approval of provisions in the Civil Code allowing for movable property\nto be offered as loan collateral will be an important step towards enhancing the supply of loanable funds in the\nbanking system. A second significant step  will  involve  expanding the  types  of  immovable  property that  can  be\nused as collateral in secured transactions. A plan will be developed by the Government to analyze the feasibility\nof using  other forms  of immovable  property  as  collateral.  At  another level, the Government  will  address  under\nthe Financial Sector Reform Program issues relating to the Office for Immovable Property Registration relating\nto  the  relatively  high  cost  of  collateral  registering  and  cumbersome  administrative  procedures  that  discourage\nregistration.\n\nBanking Supervision and Prudential Regulation\n\nTightening  selected  prudential  norms,  together  with  a  stronger  failure  resolution  framework,  will  help\n52.\ncreate a sound banking system, reducing resource misallocation and wastage, improving long-run fiscal balance\nand contributing to faster economic growth and improved welfare.\n\nMinimum Capital Requirements. Minimum capital requirements have been low  relative  to the  size  of\n53.\nthe  market  and  the  scarcity  of  banking  skills,  allowing  easy  entry  into  the  market  and  resulting  in  an  excess\nnumber of banks\u2014as many as 18 in August 1998 (currently down to 12), most of which have performed weakly\nor failed. In this way, BOM supervisory resources and Mongolia\u2019s scarce banking skills have been stretched far\ntoo thin. On September 1, 1999 the MCR was raised from T400 million to T1 billion. On January 21, 2000, the\nBank  of  Mongolia  issued  a  resolution  that  raised  the  Minimum  Capital  Requirement  (MCR)  for  commercial\nbanks from T1 billion to T2 billion, effective starting June 30, 2001, except for  new  candidate  banks, for  which\nthe increase to T2 billion is effective immediately.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 10\n\n54.\nWith the new increase to T2 billion, the MCR has been raised by a multiple of 5 over the course of the\npast four months, for new banks, and has been raised by a  factor  of  5  during the  August  1999-June  30,  2001\nperiod, for existing banks.  On  January  21,  2000, the Togrog  (T)  exchange  rate  was  T1080  per  U.S.  dollar,  so\nthat,  as  of  that  date,  the  new  minimum  capital  requirement  was  equivalent  to  about  US$1,850,000.  A\ncomparison  of  the  new  minimum  capital  requirement  in  Mongolia  with  those  in  other  countries  shows  that\nMongolia\u2019s new MCR is relatively stringent.\n\n55.\nThis  new  doubling  in  the  MCR for  banks  will  encourage  a  consolidation  of  existing  commercial  banks\ninto a smaller number of sounder banks that are capable of competing, and help ensure that any new entrants\ninto the market meet much more  stringent capital requirements.   Also, the  Bank  of  Mongolia intends  to  adjust\nthe MCR as needed, over the medium-term, to maintain its value in real terms.\n\nAsset Classification. Current regulations on asset classification deal only with loans. Losses, however,\n56.\nmay arise from other assets (including cash items; old outstanding \u201cwe debit\u201d items due from other banks; poor\nquality  investments,  suspense  items;  unresolved  differences;  accounts  receivable,  foreclosed  or  repossessed\nassets; and contingent liabilities). In addition, loans are currently considered past due only when principal and/or\ninterest is 90 days in arrears. The BOM is preparing a resolution that  will  strengthen  the  definition  of  past  due\ncriteria and require recognition of losses that occur in asset types other than loans.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action. Prompt corrective action has not been implemented in the banking system,\n57.\nwith  the  result  that  banks  with  shaky  financial  conditions  have  deteriorated  progressively.  Only  once  banks\nbecome insolvent, and often then with lengthy delays, have actions been taken to redress the situation, inflicting\nlarge losses on Mongolian society.\n\nOver the medium-term, Government intends to amend banking legislation to adopt a prompt corrective\n58.\naction, with trigger points at 75% and 50% of the Capital Adequacy Ratio, to make corrective action much more\nautomatic, to  depoliticize  bank  failure  resolution,  and  to  encourage  banks  to  maintain  higher  levels  of  capital.\nThe Trigger points at 75% and 50% of the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) would automatically activate\nmandatory  recapitalization  actions  including  the  development  of  a  capital  restoration  program,  prohibitions  on\ndividends and restrictions on asset growth, capital-raising activities and changes in the mix  of  risk  assets.  The\nfinal threshold, at 25% of the minimum CAR, is a recognition that corrective actions have been unsuccessful and\nwould culminate in mandatory closure.\n\nExit  Policy.  The  Government  intends  to  adopt  a  modern  banking  exit  policy  framework  by  amending\n59.\nthe  current  banking  legislation  on  conservatorship  and  receivership,  and  including  a  new  failure  resolution\nscheme. This new framework will better preserve the asset values  of  the  ongoing  concern; increase  the  rights\nand  choices  of  the  depositors  and  other  parties  concerned;  reduce  moral  hazard;  accelerate  resolution  and\nliquidation,  and  reduce  resolution  costs.  In  addition,  at  present,  an  implicit  state  guarantee  of  all  deposits  is\nperceived to exist. The soundness and efficiency of the financial system would be improved with a stronger exit\npolicy  that  reduces  moral  hazard;  limits  the  state\u2019s  exposure;  permits  an  effective  transfer  of  assets  from\ntroubled banks to sound institutions; and prevents contagion and reduces systemic risk.\n\n60.\nOver  the  medium-term,  Government  intends  to  strengthen  the  exit  policy  framework  through\namendments  to  the  banking  legislation.  This  framework  will  require  that  whenever  the  capital  adequacy  ratio\nfalls  below  25%  of  the  required  level,  the  resolution  framework  is  automatically  activated  without  any  further\npossibility  of  action  by  managers  and  shareholders,  in  order  to  protect  depositors.  Only  the  residual  balance\nafter resolution will need to be sent to liquidation.\n\nResidual  Assets.  An  improved  framework  is  needed  for  liquidation  of  residual  assets.  With  the  July\n61.\n1999 modification of the Banking Law, a receiver can be appointed to restructure or liquidate a bank. However,\nthe  authorities  do  not  have  all  the  legal  tools  needed  to  liquidate  banks  in  an  efficient  manner.  Further\namendments  will  be  introduced  to  the  Banking  Law  that  provide  for  the  process  of  liquidation  of  the  residual\nassets of failed bank after the resolution process has taken place.\n\nStrengthening the Regulation of NBFIs\n\n62.\n\nIn  view  of  the  limited  outreach  of  the  banking  system  and  problems  affecting  financial  intermediation,  finance\ncompanies  are  expected  to  quickly  assume  a  greater  role  in  Mongolia.  Prudential  norms  for  the  various  categories  of\nNBFIs  need  to  be  developed  as  the  existing  regulations  are  short  on  details.  There  is  also  a  need  to  ensure  that  the\nSupervision  Department  of  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  is  properly  organized  to  ensure  effective  supervision  of  NBFIs.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 11\n\nAppropriate  mechanisms  need  to  be  introduced  including  regulations  on  licensing  requirements,  risk-based  prudential\nstandards and minimum paid-in capital to ensure a healthy non-bank financial system and avoid the fragility characteristic\nof the banking system.  BOM intends to (i) strengthen NBFI regulations requiring finance companies to comply with risk-\nbased prudential regulations; and (ii) assume oversight responsibility over savings and credit cooperatives through second\nand higher tier credit associations.\n\nAsset Recovery and Nonperforming Loans\n\nMongolian  Asset  Recovery  Agency.  The  Mongolian  Asset  Recovery  Agency\u2019s  (MARA)  ability  to\n63.\nrecover nonperforming assets is hampered by its insufficient authority; lack of funding, low salaries; and lengthy\ncourt  delays. Government  plans  to  strengthen  the legal  status  and  powers  of MARA to  collect  and  dispose  of\nassets by passage of appropriate legislation. This legislation would provide MARA sufficient flexibility to quickly\nrealize assets, while opening-up asset collection to private agencies, in particular, it would enable MARA to sell\nrecovered assets at a discount and at auction, and to operate on a commercial basis.\n\nCredit  Information  Bureau.  In  order  to  improve  loan  repayment  rates,  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  also\n64.\nestablished a Credit Information Bureau. The information base on loan defaulters and mechanisms to share this\ninformation  with  banks  is  still  in  process  of  development.  The  BOM  intends  finalize  arrangements  to  enhance\nthe effectiveness of the Credit Information Bureau by focusing data collection on loan defaulters and developing\na  protocol  for  the  sharing  of  this  information  in  consultation  with  commercial  banks.  In  order  to  strengthen\noperations and upgrade the capacity of banks, integrated banking information management system software for\ntreasury  management,  foreign  exchange  operations  and  other  activities  will  be  introduced  on  a  pilot  basis  in\nTDB and then on a bank-wide basis in Mongolia.\n\nRationalizing the Payments System\n\n65.\nBank restructuring needs to be done in such a way so as to avert a disruption in payments services in\nrural areas. At present, most payment services (government wages and pensions) in rural areas are performed\nby  the  Agricultural  Bank.  Government  attaches  a  high  priority  to  ensuring  that  payment  services  are  not\ndisrupted. Government also intends to ensure that these services are provided through least-cost means.\n\nThe monthly cost of operating an AB bank sub-branch limited to providing payment services at the soum\n66.\nlevel  is  about  T160,000.  If  half  of  AB\u2019s  282 soum  level  sub-branches  were  considered  essential  in  that  these\nlocations  could  not  be  serviced  from  other  soum or aimag  branches  of  AB  or  other  banks,  the  cost  of\nmaintaining  141  sub-branches  to  provide  payments  services  only  would  about T271 million  per  annum  (about\nUS$245,000).  Government  plans  to  keep  open  those  AB  subranches  needed  to  ensure  continuity  of  payment\nservices  in  remote  areas.  Other  potential  service  providers  may  bid  for  supplying  this  service.  To  this  end,\nGovernment will define a strategic network of AB sub-branches that are essential to ensure payment services at\nthe soum level;  on  January  1,  2000  AB  signed  an  agreement  with the  Social  Insurance  Department,  whereby\nthe  latter  will  pay  for  the  transaction  costs  of  distributing  government  wages  and  pensions  throughout  the\ncountry. Government also intends to remove any remaining impediments  to  entrance  of  new  institutions  in  the\ndistribution of these payments.\n\nPublic Debt and Development of Financial Markets\n\n67.\nCreation of a government bond market would provide an alternative source of investment for banks and\nthe public; increase transparency in the management of budget deficits; and aid in the development of a capital\nmarket.  At  present,  there  is  no  legal  framework  on  public  debt.  Government  bonds  are  issued  only  to  meet\nextraordinary  financing  needs.  This  impedes  the  creation  of  a  market  for  government  bonds  and  constrains\nmarket  liquidity.  Government  plans  to  submit  to  Parliament  a  law  on  government  debt  and  government  debt\ninstruments. Given the close link to this issue, the Bank of Mongolia supports the development of an inter-bank\nmarket. An inter-bank market would provide banks in Mongolia a means to improve asset-liability management\nthrough the ability to invest surplus  funds  and  reduce  the  costs  of funding  liquidity  shortfalls.  Legal,  regulatory\nand policy considerations will be analyzed by Bank of Mongolia to help create a conducive environment for the\neventual development of an inter-bank market.\n\n\fAppendix 1, page 12\n\nDevelopment of Human Resources and Financial Infrastructure\n\nDeveloping  the  essential  infrastructure  to  complement  a  market-based  financial  system  including\n68.\nbanking skills, auditing and accounting standards, enforcement of financial contracts, and better enforcement of\nprudential  norms  is  a  top  priority.  There  is  a  dearth  of  banking  skills,  especially  with  respect  to  credit\nassessment  and  loan  management  processes  in  commercial  banks  and  regulatory  processes  in  the  BOM.  In\nsome  cases  laws  are  not  being  enforced  or  are  subject  to  inconsistent  interpretation  by  the  courts.  The  1993\naccounting  law  required  the  adoption  of  international  accounting  standards.  However,  nine  years  into  the\ntransition,  most  financial  statements  are  still  prepared  on  a  cash,  rather  than  an  accrual,  basis.  These\nstatements tend to minimize profits to lessen the tax burden and, since they are prepared on a cash basis,  do\nnot reflect the true financial condition of the enterprise.\n\n69.\nThere have been and are numerous programs to upgrade financial infrastructure, but these have lacked\nthe  strategic  basis  and  overall  coordination  needed  to  systematically  develop  this  infrastructure.  To  that  end,\nGovernment  is  preparing  a  comprehensive  Financial  Sector  Infrastructure  Action  Plan  for  development  of\nhuman  resource  skills  in  all facets  of the financial  sector  and  other  basic  building-blocks  needed  to  support  a\nhealthy  financial  sector  including  banking  and  supervision  skills,  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and\nenforcement  of  financial  contracts.  Government  has  requested  World  Bank  financial  assistance  to  implement\nthis strategy and action plan, in the form of a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit.\n\n Development of the Capital Markets\n\n 70.\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  capital  markets  to  increase  domestic  resource\nmobilization  and  effectively  allocate funds  to  those  most  productive  activities.   The  development  of  the  capital\nmarkets  would  also  increase  the  supply  of long-term funds  available  in  the  economy.  Over  the  short-term  the\nGovernment  will  support  actions  that  strengthen  the  operational  and  regulatory  capacity  of  the  MSEC  and\nimprove investor confidence in the MSE.  In  parallel, to  increase  the  supply  of  quality  stocks, the  Government\nwill  support  the  issuing  of  shares  of  some  of  the  remaining  95  SOEs.  In  addition,  the  Government  has\nincorporated  under  its  Guidelines  of  the  Cabinet  for  Economic  and  Social  Development  the  submission  to\nParliament of a Law on Trusts and a Law on Investment Funds in 2000 as part of efforts to establish the legal\nframework  for  new  investment  products.  Finally,  the  Government  is  committed  to  the  establishment  of  MSE,\nCDS and the securities clearing and settlement system as separate legal entities and subsequent  privatization\nof them; as separate privatized institutions, they will foster the development of a more effective and professional\nsecurities exchange.\n\nConsensus-Building on Financial Sector Reform\n\nGovernment  recognizes  that implementation  of  its  Medium-Term  Strategy for  Financial  Sector  Reform\n71.\nand Development requires a broad consensus in Mongolia, as well as the support of our external development\npartners. To this end, we have created a Financial Sector Development Performance Group (FSDPG as a forum\nto  exchange  ideas  and  reach  broad  consensus  on  the  long-term  vision  and  medium-term  strategy  for  the\nfinancial sector. We expect this forum to monitor progress on a regular basis and determine if there is need to\nchange  direction  as  the  program  evolves.  The  FSDPG  includes  high-level  members  of  Government  policy-\nmaking bodies (including the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Bank of\nMongolia, the Cabinet Secretariat and the State Property Committee); members of  Parliament from  all  parties;\nNGO  and  private  sector  representatives;  and  donors  representatives,  including  the  ADB,  GTZ,  JICA,  IMF,\nUSAID and World Bank.\n\n\fMONGOLIA: FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM *\n\nPOLICY MATRIX\n\nDevelopment\nObjectives/Key\nIssues\n\nDiagnosis\n\nGovernment Strategy/\nActions\n\nIDA Board\nConditions/Status\n\nTranche Policies\n\nMacroeconomic Framework\n\nIDA First Tranche/\nCondition of\neffectiveness; ADB\nBoard Consideration /\nFirst Tranche\n\nIDA/ ADB Second\nTranches\n\nIDA Floating\nTranche\n\n\u2022  Maintain a sound\nmacroeconomic\nframework as\ndetermined on the basis\nof indicators agreed\nbetween the Borrower\nand IDA.\n\n\u2022  Maintain a sound\nmacroeconomic\nframework as\ndetermined on the basis\nof indicators agreed\nbetween the Borrower\nand IDA.\n\n\u2022  Maintain a sound\nmacroeconomic\nframework as\ndetermined on the\nbasis of indicators\nagreed between the\nBorrower and IDA.\n\n\u2022  Mongolia needs high,\nsustained labor-intensive\ngrowth to steadily raise\nliving standards and reduce\nthe incidence of poverty.\nFiscal sustainability is a\nmajor challenge facing\nMongolia in achieving\nmacroeconomic stability.\nThe high level of interest\nrates reflect in part the\nimpact of large fiscal\ndeficits.\n\n\u2022  Mongolia needs to\nmanage external shocks\nefficiently to significantly\nraise its long-term growth\nand welfare gains.  Cyclical\nbanking crises are caused\nin part by term of trade\nshocks.\n\n\u2022  Growth averaged\n3.5% during1994-98,\naccording to official\nstatistics.  Although\nactual growth has been\nhigher (because national\naccounts overestimate\nthe impact of  declining\nsectors and\nunderestimate that of\nexpanding ones), the\nincidence of poverty also\nremains high, at 35.6%\n(36.3% in 1995).\n\u2022  Mongolia has yet to\ntake measures to\nmanage external price\nshocks. Commodity price\nfluctuations have led to\nthe classic boom and\nbust cycle, with low trend\ngrowth. Copper prices\nplunged 42% in 1998,\nand a further 17% in\nJanuary-August  1999.\nCashmere and gold\nprices also are\ndepressed; petroleum\nprices have more than\ndoubled in the past year.\nValue of terms of trade\nshock is estimated at\nabout 9% of GDP in\n1998, and an additional\npossible 4% in 1999.\n\n\u2022  Government\u2019s\nmacro-economic policy\nframework is designed to\nmaintain inflation in\nsingle digits, facilitate\nadjustment to external\nshocks, build-up holdings\nof external assets and\nbring down real interest\nrates to sustainable\nlevels.\n\n\u2022  Government plans\nto form a Working Group\non managing Commodity\nRisk to consider\nmeasures to mitigate\nexternal commodity risk\nand terms of trade\nshocks including the\nadoption of risk\nmanagement systems by\nthe major producers of\ncommodities most\nvulnerable to price\nshocks (copper and\ngold).  Mongolia has\nbeen selected as early\ntest case in World Bank\u2019s\ncommodity initiative and\nwork is  expected to start\nin early 2000.\n\n\u2022  Completion of the said\naction plan, in a

About  1.2  million  are  of  working  age.\n2.\nThe average life expectancy is 64 years for both men and women. The infant mortality rate is 53\nper 100,000 live births. The average literacy rate is 96 percent.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty\n\n3.\nIn  1991,  the  incidence  of  poverty  was  estimated  at  15  percent  of  households.  This\nincreased  during  the  early  1990s  as  trade  was  disrupted  following  the  breakup  of  the  former\nSoviet  Union.  Subsequent  economic  developments  with  worsening  terms  of  trade  and  the\ntransition to a market-oriented economy may have contributed to the rise in poverty.\n\n4.\nThe  World  Bank  undertook  a  living  standard  measurement  survey  in  1995,  and\nintroduced an expenditure-based poverty line to meet a calorie intake of 2,100 comparable with\nother developing countries. This study was replicated in 1998, and showed that the incidence of\npoverty  remained  stable  at  36.3  percent  of  households  in  1995,  and  35.6  in  1998.  The  slow\ndecline follows from population growth.\n\n5.\nPoverty is found mainly in the small towns where workers are laid off from state-owned\nenterprises, and few other employment opportunities exist. Ulaanbaatar, with 25 percent of the\npopulation, is home to 17 percent of the poor; the incidence of poverty is lower here, than in the\ncountryside. Poverty is particularly severe among households headed by women (18.4 percent\nof all households and a poverty incidence of 60 percent), early pensioners (40 percent poverty\nincidence for  men  and 55  percent for  women), unemployed, and herdsmen.  Among  people  in\nwage employment and public servants, 48 percent are estimated to be moderately poor, which\nis higher than in the informal and agriculture sectors.\n\n6.\nIn  1994,  the Government  introduced  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  with  the\nobjectives  of  (i)  reducing  poverty  through  employment  creation,  (ii)  protecting  human  capital\nthrough  social  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  (iii)  addressing  poverty  among  households  headed\nby  women,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  social  safety  net.  The  program  is  financed  by  aid.  The\nmajor  components  are  (i)  income  generation  and  microfinance,  (ii)  public  works,  (iii) targeted\nassistance,  and  (iv)  capacity  and  institution  building.  During  1994-2000,  $15.3 million  was\nallocated for the program. Income-generating activities and microfinance has had little effect on\npoverty reduction as most of the  credit tended to  be  used for  consumption. While  community-\nbased  public  works  programs  have  been  successful  for  income  generation  and  social\ninfrastructure  rehabilitation,  these  do  not  contribute  to  a  sustainable  reduction  of  poverty.\nVarious other program have been initiated to reduce unemployment, but there are no clear data\navailable that measure the impact of these.\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 2\n\nC.\n\nLabor Force Participation and Unemployment\n\n7.\nThe official labor force is relatively small. By the end of 1998, only 809,500 workers were\nregistered,  amounting  to  67  percent  of  working  age  population  and  34  percent  of  the  total\npopulation. Each year, 25,000 people officially enter the labor force. However, there appear to\nbe growing job opportunities in the informal sector.\n\n8.\nAt the end of 1998, 49,837 people were registered as unemployed and by July 1999, this\nhad fallen to 45,300. This can be explained by inaccurate statistics, and/or a reluctance among\nthe  unemployed  to  register.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  the  unemployed  are  absorbed\ninto the informal sector.\n\nD. \n\nThe Financial Sector\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Services Used by the Population\n\n9.\nFinancial  services  in  Mongolia  are  rudimentary,  just  as  they  are  in  other  transition\neconomies.  Banks  engage  in  basic  deposit  taking  and  lending,  and  capital  markets  are\nunderdeveloped. Banking facilities tend to be concentrated in urban areas.\n\nPublic  confidence  in  banks  is  relatively  low,  as  evidenced  by  the  low  deposit  to  gross\n\n10.\ndomestic product.\n\n2. \n\nEmployment in the Financial Sector\n\nThe  employment  potential  in  the  financial  sector  is  limited.  Banking  employed  4,000\n11.\npersons  as  of  May  2000  down  from  close  to  4,000  at  mid-1998.  The  reduction  reflects  the\nrestructuring  and  closure  of  eight  banks.  Three  banks,  Bank  of  Investment  and  Technological\nInnovation  and  Reconstruction  Bank,  currently  under  liquidation  and  Agricultural  Bank,  under\nrestructuring account for  the  share of  retrenched  workers.  The average  number  of  employees\nper  bank  is  170.  In  the  longer  term,  employment  opportunities  should  arise  in  the  financial\nsector as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) develop, and the demand for financial services\ngrows, but during the FSP II period, the employment level is likely to remain stable or possibly\nexpand moderately.\n\nE.\n\nPolicy Actions and their Impact on the Poor\n\n1.\n\nImprove the Soundness and Efficiency of Banking\n\nThe  objectives  are  to  restructure  and  rehabilitate  banks,  strengthen  regulation  and\nthe\n\n12.\nsupervision of banks,  improve  corporate  governance  for  banking  sector,  strengthen \nmanagement information system for banks, and develop an interbank market.\n\n13.\nImplementation  of  this  policy  should  improve  the  soundness  and  reliability  of  banks.\nProperly  regulated  and  supervised  banks  that  supply  adequate  and  timely  information  to\nauthorities and the population should increase public confidence in banks, and thereby increase\ndemand  for  services.  However,  banking  employs  few  people  and  therefore  the  effect  on\nemployment will be limited.\n\n\fTable A3.1: Poverty Impact of\n Improving the Soundness and Efficiency of the Banking System\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nItem\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nLiquidation of banks\nwill lead to job losses\n\nSeverance payments\nshould mitigate the\neffect\n\nLabor\n\nPrices\n\nAccess for the\npoor\n\nTransfers\nAssumptions\n\nA sound and efficient\nbanking system will\nsupport economic\ngrowth\n\nStronger and better\nmanaged banks will\ndecrease the\nincidence and\ndisruptions due to\nbanking crises\n\nNet effect\n\nOverall positive\n\n2.\n\nEnhance the role of NBFIs\n\nof\n\ncost \n\nReduced \ncapital\nGovernment\nresources used to\nsupport banks will be\nfreed for productive\npurposes\n\nImproved  access  to\ncredit\n\n14.\nThe  objective  is  to  strengthen  regulation  and  supervision  of  NBFIs.  At  present,  NBFIs\nplay a minor role in financial intermediation. However, as the economy grows and the demand\nfor financial services increases, their role will expand. It is imperative that NBFIs grow in a well-\nregulated and supervised environment. In the longer term, NBFIs will also provide employment\nopportunities.\n\nTable A3.2: Poverty Impact of\nEnhancing the Role of NBFIs in Financial Intermediation\n\nItem\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nNone\n\nLabor\nPrices\nAccess for\npoor\nTransfers\nAssumptions\n\nWell-regulated and\nsupervised NBFIs will\ncontribute to\nimproved financial\nintermediation and\nefficient allocation of\nresources\nPoor-neutral/positive\n\nTotal net effect\n\nNBFI  =  nonbank financial institution.\n\nImproved  access  to\ncredit\n\n3.\n\nSupport and Facilitate Capital Market Development\n\nThe objectives of this policy are to improve governance in equity markets, and establish\n\n15.\na legal infrastructure for capital market development.\n\n16.\nIn  the  longer  term,  the  development  of  capital  markets  will  contribute  to  improved\nfinancial  intermediation  and  resource  allocation.  The  FSP  II  will  ensure  that  capital  markets\n\n\fdevelop in a sound legal  environment, and  that  proper  reporting and disclosure  arrangements\nare in place to enhance transparency and contribute to good governance. While direct impacts\non the poor are negligible, there should be long-term  indirect  benefits  in terms of employment\ncreation.\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nTable A3.3: Poverty Impact of\nSupporting and Facilitating Capital Market Development\n\nItem\n\nDirect Effect\n\nIndirect Effect\n\nMacro\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nLabor\n\nnone\n\nLonger-term,\nemployment\nopportunities\nshould arise\n\nPrices\n\nAccess for\npoor\nTransfers\nAssumptions\n\nTotal net effect\n\nThe Government\nagencies concerned,\nand capital market\nparticipants will\nproperly implement\nthe required policy\nactions\nPoor to\nneutral/positive\n\nImprove efficient\nallocation of capital\n\nImprove resource\nmobilization\n\n4. \n\nPromote and Strengthen Contractual Savings Institutions\n\n17.\nThe  objectives  are  to  improve  the  administrative  processes  in  the  existing  pension\nsystem,  prepare  for  transition  to  a  reformed  pension  system,  and  improve  regulations  and\nsupervision of the insurance industry.\n\n18.\nImprovement  of  the  administrative  processes  in  the  pension  system  should  benefit\npensioners  directly  through  more  timely  payment  of  pensions  (assuming  that  pensions  are\npaid). Reforms in the pension system will make it more sustainable in the long run, and thereby\nbenefit  future  pensioners.
