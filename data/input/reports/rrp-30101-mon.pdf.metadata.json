FSP II and the International Development\nAssociation\u2019s (IDA) Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC)\njointly  support  the  Government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform\nProgram (FSRP), the umbrella program.\nThe Program\nRationale Mongolia\u2019s  impaired  financial  system  is  potentially  the  most\nsignificant constraint to achieving stable economic growth and\nthe  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  objectives,\nincluding poverty reduction. In view of the vulnerabilities of the\neconomy to supply-side shocks as experienced in 1994, 1996,\nand 1998, and the concomitant effects on the banking system,\nthe development of a sound, stable, and resilient financial system\nis imperative to avoid disruptions from protracted banking crises\nand improve financial intermediation. These disruptions have led\nto  decreasing  confidence  in  the  banking  system,  as  banks\nbecame  insolvent  and  domestic  savings  were  wiped  out.\nIncreases  in  intermediation  spreads  and  higher  bank\nrestructuring costs have added to fiscal pressures and eroded\nmacroeconomic stabilization.\nSince 1996, the  Government  has accelerated financial  sector\nreforms  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Program  loan  (FSP),\nwhich  was  satisfactorily  implemented  by  June  1999.  Notably,\nfrom mid-1998 the pace of banking  reforms accelerated, and\nbold measures were introduced. Commercial banks\u2019 prudential\nregulations  were  strengthened,  eight  insolvent  banks  were\nclosed, bank licensing requirements were made more stringent,\nbank exit policies were tightened, and loan recovery became a\npriority.  Subsequently,  the  Government  adopted  a\ncomprehensive financial sector strategy that provides a long-term\nvision  and  medium-term  strategy  for  the  development  of  the\nsector. This strategy was unanimously supported at a financial\nsector coordination of external financers meeting in Ulaanbaataar\nin February 2000.\nThe  FSRP  will  build  on  these  reforms  to  improve  banking\ngovernance  with  the  objective  of  strengthening  financial\nintermediation. The FSRP also aims to achieve a more balanced\nfinancial  structure  by  developing  nonbank  financial\nintermediaries,  capital  markets,  and  contractual  savings\ninstitutions. The FSP II supports these reforms. In addition, the", "iii\nFSP  II  will  address  legal  and  regulatory  deficiencies  in  the\nnonbank  financial  sector  and  capital  markets,  including  the\npension and insurance systems. These reforms are expected to\npromote the medium-term goal of enhancing domestic resource\nmobilization, including long-term sources of investment funds to\ncomplement  the  lending  channels  intermediated  through  the\nbanking system and improve efficiency in resource allocation.\nThe FSP II will support the Government\u2019s efforts to develop a\nbalanced,  competitive,  and  market-based  financial  system\naccording to its long-term vision for financial sector development\nand its medium-term strategy to achieve this vision. The FSP II is\nclassified as pro-poor growth, as without these reforms domestic\nresource mobilization and thus investment will be constrained,\nresulting  in  lower  employment  and  income.  It  will  focus  on\nimproving financial sector governance and contribute to reducing\npoverty.\nObjective and The objective of the FSP II is to promote the development of a\nScope competitive, stable, and broad-based financial system in order to\nstrengthen  financial  intermediation,  enhance  domestic  and\nexternal  resource  mobilization,  and  support  sustainable\neconomic growth.\nThe FSP II will focus on (i) fostering improved governance and\noperations in the banking system, (ii) developing marketable loan\ncollateral,  (iii)  promoting  the  development  of  the  interbank\nmarket, (iv) enhancing the regulatory and supervisory framework\nfor  nonbank  financial  institutions,  (v)  strengthening  the\noperational and regulatory capacity of the Mongolian Securities\nExchange  Commission  (MSEC),  (vi) developing  legal\ninfrastructure  to  create  a  conducive  environment  for  the\nsecurities  markets,  (vii) supporting  the transformation from an\nunfunded to a partially funded pension system, (viii) building the\ncapacity of Social Security Insurance General Office (SSIGO),\nand  (ix) strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\ninsurance sector development.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category C.  Environmental implications were reviewed, and no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount A  policy  loan  of  SDR11,448,000  ($15  million  equivalent)  is\nand Terms proposed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will\nhave a maturity of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe loan will carry an annual interest charge of 1 percent during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period.", "iv\nProgram Period The loan is expected to be used over 36 months commencing\n            and Tranching from the date of loan effectiveness. The loan proceeds may be\nused to finance the cost of eligible imports incurred within 180\ndays prior to the date of effectiveness. The loan will be released\nin two tranches. The first tranche will be $5 million equivalent,\nand the second tranche $10 million equivalent. The first tranche\nwill be released upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The\nsecond tranche is expected to be released by December 2001,\nsubject  to  the  fulfillment  of  all  conditions  for  release  of  the\nsecond tranche set forth in the policy matrix. The FSP II also\ncontains  a  set  of  conditions  that  must  be  fulfilled  for  its\nsuccessful completion.\nExecuting The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) will be the Executing Agency for\nAgency the FSP II. It will have overall responsibility for implementation,\nincluding  the  administration  and  disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of quarterly\nprogress reports on FSP II implementation. A steering committee\nhas been established to oversee the FSP II implementation. The\ncommittee will be chaired by the deputy governor of BOM, and\nwill  include  high-level  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of\nFinance  (MOF),  MSEC,  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE),\nSSIGO, Ministry of Justice, and State Property Committee. The\nsteering committee will meet at least once every three months to\nensure that the proposed reforms are undertaken in accordance\nwith  the  agreed  timetable.  An  adequately  staffed  program\nimplementing unit has been established within BOM.\nProcurement The  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign\nexchange costs (excluding local duties and  taxes)  of  imports\nprocured in and from ADB member countries, other than those\nspecified in a list of ineligible items and those items financed by\nother multilateral and bilateral official sources. All procurement\nunder the loan will be undertaken through normal commercial\npractices for the private sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed\nprocurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due\nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Borrower  will\ncertify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of\nthe  projected  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  in  a  given\nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds\nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\nCounterpart The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds\nFunds will be used to finance the structural adjustment costs for reforms\nto be initiated and implemented under the FSP II.", "v\nTechnical Assistance\nTo help the Government implement the FSP II, ADB will provide\nTA  for  $600,000  equivalent  to  strengthen  financial  sector\ndevelopment.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  strengthening  of  the\nbanking supervision system and development of loan collateral;\n(ii) capital  market  reforms  through  legal  and  regulatory\nstrengthening of the equity markets; and (iii) strengthening of the\nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  developing\ncontractual savings institutions. The TA will be financed by ADB\non  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  It  is\nestimated  that  about  18  person-months  of  international\nconsulting  services  and  10  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  All  consultants  will  be\nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants.\nRisks and Safeguards The principal risk lies in the timing of the proposed FSP II. The\nFSP II loan will be presented for Board consideration just prior to\na Parliamentary election. It is expected that the FSP II will be\nratified by the current Parliament (within July). However, if this\nParliament does not ratify the FSP II, then the new Parliament\nmay  need  additional  lead  time  before  final  ratification.  This\nconcern is considered manageable in view of the nature of the\npolicy actions proposed under FSP II, which have support from\nthe various political groups.\nA  second  risk  is  that,  because  of  resistance  or  lack  of\ncooperation by vested interests, the Government may be unable\nto implement the policy measures required to strengthen legal\nprovisions and privatization of the MSE. In addition, there may be\nrisks  associated  with  weak  capacity  at  the  agency  level  to\nsuccessfully implement the reforms, as well as risks stemming\nfrom weak coordination between institutions. To address these\ndownside risks from weak capacity, TA will be provided to key\nagencies\u2014BOM,  MOF,  MSEC,  SSIGO\u2014for  institutional\nupgrading. Policy coordination will be supported by the high-level\nsteering committee and  program implementation unit.", "I .  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program (FSP II).  The report also describes\nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Financial Sector Development, and if the\nproposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the\nBoard, shall approve the TA.\nII .  INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1991, Mongolia began a comprehensive reform process. The goal was to transform\nthe economy from a centrally planned to a market-based system. The Government\u2019s reform\nprogram, backed by firm external assistance, sought to achieve a systemic transformation to a\nmarket  economy,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  economic\ntransformation has been marked by the removal of price controls, privatization of state-owned\nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  development  of  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector-led\ndevelopment supported by a relatively small and fragile financial system. The impact of these\nreforms led to an average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.6 percent over\nthe last five years. Inflation has been brought down from over 50 percent in 1996 to single digit\nin 1998 (although it increased to 10 percent in 1999). However, in several areas economic\nprogress has been frequently interrupted by protracted political uncertainties and terms of trade\nshocks due to volatile commodity export prices because of the vulnerabilities of the small,\nnarrow-based, open economy. These developments have often strained the fiscal and external\naccounts.\n3. The economic and political vulnerabilities have complicated the process of financial\nsector development in Mongolia. To lay the foundation for a sound and market-oriented financial\nsector, the Government launched the first phase of its financial sector reforms from 1996 to\n1999. This was supported by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Financial Sector Program\n(FSP) loan1, for SDR24.201 million ($35 million equivalent) and two TAs.2 The FSP focused on\n(i)  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  financial  sector  consistent  with\ninternational standards; (ii) restructuring the banking system to strengthen viable banks and\nclose insolvent banks; (iii) reducing the Government\u2019s involvement, while encouraging market\norientation and commercializing the banking system; and (iv) developing capacities to improve\nbank  credit  and  risk  management,  portfolio  and  asset-liability  management  systems,  and\nsupervision systems.\n4. Implementation of the FSP,3 though somewhat slower than expected, helped introduce\nmarket  orientation  and  commercialization  in  the  banking  system.  Key  reforms  included\nliberalizing banking policies, strengthening regulations, and restoring health of the viable banks,\nwhile closing insolvent banks. Currently with the exception of the Agricultural Bank (AB) under\nreceivership, and Savings Bank (SB) with lending restrictions and pending restructuring, all\nbanks meet capital adequacy requirements. Furthermore, comparing prudential regulations in\nthe banking system as a whole between December 1997 and December 1999 reveals that\ncapital adequacy, liquidity, foreign exchange exposure, and loan loss provisioning requirements\n                                               \n1\n  Loan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program, for  $35 million, approved on 19 December 1996.\n2\nTA 2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of Bank of Mongolia, for $1 million,\napproved on 19 December 1996; and TA Loan 1510-MON: Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks,\nfor $3 million, approved on 19 December 1996 to support loan implementation.\n3\n  R107-99: Loan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program Loan, Progress Report: Release of Second Tranche,\n15 July 1999.", "2\nhave all improved. However, the financial sector remains weak, lacks diversification, and plays a\nlimited role in the economy. Financial intermediation in Mongolia would benefit from stronger\nand better managed banks, together with the development of nonbank financial institutions\n(NBFIs). The structure of the financial sector is unbalanced, the stock market is small and\nilliquid, and market-based insurance and leasing businesses are just beginning to emerge.\n5. The  FSP  complemented  and  reinforced  the  enhanced  structural  adjustment  facility\n(ESAF), for 1997-2000, approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the first\nannual arrangement eventually lapsed on 30 July 1998 due to a sharp deterioration in the fiscal\naccounts, in July 1999 the Government negotiated a second annual arrangement of SDR14.8\nmillion  for  1999-2000.  Under  the  ESAF,  the  Government  adopted  a  strong  macroeconomic\nstabilization program based on (i) tight fiscal and monetary policies to curb inflationary pressures\nand (ii) wide-ranging sector reforms to strengthen banking.\n6.  To carry forward the first phase of financial sector reforms, the Government with the\nassistance of the International Development Association (IDA), formulated a long-term vision\nand  medium-term  strategy for financial  sector  development.4  These  were discussed  at  an\nexternal assistance coordination meeting in Ulaanbaatar in February 2000. To implement this\nstrategy, the Government asked ADB and IDA to support the second phase of financial sector\nreforms. In response, ADB and IDA have developed a comprehensive Financial Sector Reform\nProgram (FSRP) covering the various subsectors of the financial sector for potential parallel\nfinancing of the associated costs of structural adjustments. This umbrella program, the FSRP,\nwill be  supported by (i) a financial sector adjustment credit (FSAC) of $32 million equivalent\napproved by IDA on 20 April 20005 and (ii) the proposed FSP II.\n7. The broad objectives and scope of the FSP II were discussed with the Government\nduring the Reconnaissance Mission fielded in January 2000. Following this, ADB participated in\nthe external assistance coordination meeting in February to finalize the pace and sequence of\noverall financial sector reforms over the medium term. An ADB mission subsequently visited\nWashington in March 2000 to discuss the FSRP with the Government, and develop coordination\nand  parallel  financing  arrangements.  Subsequently,  a  joint  ADB-IDA  mission6  visited\nUlaanbaatar in late March 2000 and reached agreements on a common development policy\nletter and policy matrix (Appendix 1) which form the basis for the FSRP. At IDA\u2019s request, an\nADB representative attended the World Bank Board presentation of the FSAC.\n8. The implementation of this common policy framework will be jointly supervised by ADB\nand IDA. Under the agreed arrangements, the FSAC will focus on banking reforms, while the\nFSP II will focus on reforms of financial governance, nonbank financial (NBF) intermediaries\n(including capital market development), and contractual savings. See policy matrix for FSP II in\nAppendix 2. The FSP II program framework is presented in Appendix 3.\n                                               \n4  World Bank. 1999.

The Government\u2019s  medium-term  economic  adjustment  and  reform  strategy  aims  to\nstabilize the economy and maintain social protection programs within a prudent medium-term\nexpenditure  framework.  The  reform  strategy  also  seeks  to  accelerate  enabling  structural\nreforms that facilitate private sector-led development as well as public sector restructuring. This\nstabilization and adjustment program is complemented by investments in social and economic\ninfrastructure that aim to reduce poverty and strengthen Mongolia\u2019s competitiveness. The key\ncomponents  of  the  strategy  include  (i) macroeconomic  stabilization,  (ii)  financial  sector\ndevelopment,  (iii)  private  sector  development,  (iv)  new  approaches  to  infrastructure\ndevelopment,  (v) promotion  of  foreign  direct  investment,  (vi) promotion  of  export-oriented\nindustries, and (vii) human and social sector development.\n10. The Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy emphasizes sustained economic\ngrowth and development of a strong financial sector. The strategy highlights the importance of\ndeveloping a healthy financial  system to improve macroeconomic stability, mobilize savings,\nand restore credit to cash-strapped sectors of the economy.  For a more detailed presentation of\nthe Government\u2019s long-term vision and medium-term strategy for financial sector development\nsee paras. 52-53.\nB. Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n1. Macroeconomic Performance\n11. Mongolia began the transition to a market-based economy in 1991. Following three\nyears of adjustment characterized by negative growth, the economy grew at an average annual\nrate of 3.6 percent during 1994-1999. The source of growth is traced primarily to private sector-\nled  agriculture  sector  development,  following  the  privatization  of  livestock  herding  and\nmanufacturing,  and  expansion  of  service.  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  performance  is  heavily\ndependent on the production and export of primary commodities including cashmere, copper,\nand gold. These three commodities are, however prone to volatile price fluctuations in world\nmarkets, which have exposed Mongolia to significant terms of trade shocks in 1994, 1996, and\nagain in 1998 that have adversely affected macroeconomic stability.7 The severe winter of 1999-\n2000 resulting in a serious depletion of Mongolia\u2019s livestock have far-reaching implications for\npoverty reduction in the coming years.\n12. Notwithstanding terms of trade reversals, the macroeconomic framework has gradually,\nalbeit modestly, improved. Tight monetary policy pursued during 1997-1999 has resulted in the\ninflation rate dropping from 53 percent in 1996 to 6 percent in 1998, even though it rose to\n10 percent  in  1999.  While  tugrug  depreciation  was  moderate  in  early  1998,  the  Bank  of\nMongolia (BOM) devalued the currency by 16 percent in mid-1998 to accommodate the sudden\nfall in copper prices. Monetary policy will continue to aim at containing inflation at a single-digit\nrate and facilitate exchange rate management in order to build up international reserves.\n13. For the past five  years,  the  budget  deficit averaged  10 percent of  GDP  (excluding\nprivatization proceeds). Despite a 3 percent increase in the value-added tax (from 10 to 13\npercent in 1998), the introduction of a $7 per ton excise tax on petroleum, and the reinstatement\n                                               \n7\n  Since late 1997 average export prices of copper fell by 23 percent, cashmere 21 percent; and gold 5 percent\nresulting in a fall of export earnings of 23 percent in 1998.", "4\nof a 5 percent import tax in 1999, difficulties in mobilizing tax revenue continue. Tax revenues,\nwhich represent 18 percent of GDP, could be improved. As a result of weak revenue collection,\nfiscal adjustments have been mostly accommodated by reductions of capital expenditures. This\nhas dampened long-term economic growth prospects. The severe terms of trade shock and the\nspillovers of the Asian and Russian crises have also had a significant impact on the budget\ndeficit,8 which rose to 11.3 percent in 1998. The Government\u2019s move to defer its pension\nliabilities and social transfers has affected vulnerable segments of the population. In addition,\ndelays in interest payments on bank restructuring bonds have negatively affected the financial\nposition of the banks. Prudent fiscal management will be critical to achieving and sustaining\nmacroeconomic stability.\n14. Mongolia\u2019s balance of payment position has been tenuous. In 1998, the external current\naccount deficit deteriorated and rose to 11.4 percent of GDP. The weakness of the external\naccount stems from the country\u2019s narrow export base, which is heavily dependent on primary\ncommodities that are subject to higher price volatility. Foreign direct investment inflows continue\nto  be  moderate;  annual  inflows  rose  to  $2.9 million  in  1999  from  $2.6  million  in  1997.\nInternational reserves rose to $100 million in 1999 (11.6 weeks of import coverage), up from\n$75 million (7.1 weeks of import coverage) in 1998 reflecting the tugrug depreciation in 1998\nand the effects on net exports (largely due to a decrease in imports). The domestic and external\nresource gaps have been met by external borrowing. By the end of 1999, the external debt grew\nto an estimated 78 percent of GDP (up from 53 percent in 1995).  However, most of this debt\nhas been contracted on a long-term, concessional basis. The Government continues to limit\nforeign borrowing to concessional lending. Despite moderate improvements to macroeconomic\nmanagement, Mongolia remains a relatively poor country with income per capita estimated at\n$430 with official development assistance contributing up to 30 percent of the consolidated\nbudget. This makes Mongolia one of the biggest recipients of multilateral aid in per capita terms.\nA recent sovereign risk rating by an international credit rating agency classified the country as B\nminus. Trends in key macroeconomic indicators for 1994-1999 are presented in Supplementary\nAppendix A.\n2. Macroeconomic Prospects\n15. The Government with IMF support has embarked on a strong adjustment program to\nmaintain inflation below 10 percent, promote sustained annual output growth of about 4 percent,\nand strengthen Mongolia\u2019s external position. Central to the achievement of these objectives is\nthe implementation of a fiscal policy package designed to reduce the overall Government deficit\nto 6.5 percent of GDP by 2001, from 11.3 percent in 1998. This fiscal policy package, presented\nto Parliament in April 1999, includes measures to increase Government revenue by 2 percent of\nGDP and reduce its spending by about 1 percent of GDP on an annual basis. The goal is to\neliminate  net  bank  credit  to  the  Government  by  2000,  thereby  averting  a  resurgence  of\ninflationary  pressures  and  freeing-up  additional  resources  for  private  sector  development.\nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  public  sector  reform  program  and  acceleration  of  the\nprivatization of the most valuable SOEs are critical for fiscal consolidation. At the same time, the\nadoption of a flexible exchange rate policy will facilitate smooth adjustment to changes in the\nterms of trade.\n16. Mongolia\u2019s medium-term economic outlook is predicated on the Government\u2019s success\nin  adhering  to  fiscal  and  monetary  programs  in  support  of  strengthening  macroeconomic\nfundamentals. In particular, the fiscal  position needs  to  be  strengthened  by  improving  tax\n                                               \n8\n  Losses in unrealized budget revenues in 1998 were approximately Tug20 billion reflecting decreased income tax\nand dividend payments from Erdenet Mining Corporation.", "5\nrevenue collection. The effects of the Zud\u2014the severe winter condition that killed 2 million head\nof livestock out of a total stock of 32 million\u2014will put pressure on the fiscal and monetary\nprograms.  Preliminary estimates put the livestock losses at up to $30 million. The Government\nexpenditures will likely rise in response to the emergency, thus fueling inflationary expectations.\nEfforts to contain public spending in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for July\n2000 are also being closely monitored. The continued maintenance of a prudent monetary\npolicy will help contain inflationary pressures emanating from external shocks and domestic\nrelative price adjustments. In the longer term, sustained improvements in Mongolia\u2019s welfare will\nalso crucially hinge on how efficiently it diversifies its economy and reduces dependence on the\nexploitation of primary commodities, such as copper, for income and employment generation.\nTo reduce the destabilizing effects of the significant price volatility of key commodities, the\nFSAC  will  seek  to  introduce  measures  to  mitigate  risks  and  improve  macroeconomic\nmanagement.\n17. In addition to these macroeconomic policy measures, the Government recognizes that\nits strategy for private sector-led growth must also be built on the foundation of a solvent and\nefficient financial system. Moderate fiscal deficits coupled with single-digit inflation over the\nmedium term should lead to a lowering of the central bank\u2019s bill rate (short-term monetary policy\ninstrument).  Combined  with  ongoing  bank  restructuring  and  loan  recovery  efforts  to  be\nsupported under the FSRP, the lowered central bank bill rate is expected to result in lower\ninterest spreads and improve financial intermediation. This is likely to improve access to credit\nin the economy. The enhanced banking regulatory framework will improve asset quality in the\nbanking system. These measures combined with the continuation of official loan disbursements\nand improvements in foreign direct investment inflows are expected to help improve economic\ngrowth prospects in the medium term.\nIV .  THE SECTOR\nA. Background, Constraints, and Issues\n1. Banking System\na. Background\n18. Mongolia currently has 12 licensed commercial banks, with a network of over 500 branches,\nsubbranches, and cash counters, while foreign (minority) participation is limited to one bank. The\nbanks have about 500,000 customers and employ approximately 2,000 people. As of December\n1999, the three largest banks in terms of assets\u2014Trade and Development Bank (TDB), SB, and\nGolomt Bank\u2014held some 80 percent of all bank assets. In terms of deposit liabilities (time and\ndemand deposits), SB alone had about 46 percent of total deposits. Net lending in the banking\nsystem is Tug53.6 billion backed by total assets of Tug182 billion. Capital adequacy in the banking\nsystem is 20 percent. As of December 1999, the three problem banks\u2014AB, Bank of Investment and\nTechnological Innovation (BITI), and Reconstruction Bank (RB)\u2014accounted for about 10 percent of\ntotal assets and 56 percent (BITI and RB account for 50 percent) of nonperforming loans in the\nbanking  system.  Eight  banks  are  fully  or  partially  owned  by  the  Government.  Fully  private\ncommercial banks account for about 10 percent of all assets. Financial intermediation through the\nbanking system is limited. There is a narrow range of financial instruments (domestic and foreign\ncurrency deposits, and treasury and central bank bills), with only one bank offering a checking\naccount facility.\n19. Financial sector reforms in Mongolia were initiated in 1991. To replace the monobanking\nsystem, the Government established a two-tier banking system and entrusted Bank of Mongolia", "6\n(BOM) with responsibility for maintaining  monetary  stability  and  supervising  the operations  of\ncommercial banks. During 1991-1995, measures were taken to phase out directed lending, improve\nbanking  regulations,  and  encourage  commercial  banks  to  adopt  better  credit  management.\nHowever, the banking system remained fragile. Commercial banks had loan-to-deposit ratios of\nmore than 80 percent, were unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to service the needs of their\nclients, and violated reserve requirements and liquidity norms stipulated by BOM. Four of the five\nlarge commercial banks and three of the smaller, privately owned, banks were technically insolvent.\nIn part, the weaknesses of the banking system reflected (i) carryover costs associated with inherited\nand directed loans, (ii) poor management, (iii) a weak regulatory and supervisory framework, and\n(iv) a limited skills base.\n20. In July 1996, the incoming Government announced a plan to promote the establishment\nof a sound market-based financial system. Salient features of this plan, supported by ADB, IMF,\nand World Bank, include (i) closure of two large insolvent banks: Ardyn Bank and Insurance\nBank; (ii) the creation of the Mongolian Asset Restructuring Agency to purchase nonperforming\nassets of banks in exchange for Government bonds; (iii) establishment of two new banks, RB\nand SB, with the former inheriting the performing loans and commercial deposits, and the latter\ntaking over the household deposits of the two closed banks; and (iv) restructuring of AB and\nBITI. These reforms restored some confidence in the banks in 1997. This led to a rise in\ndeposits,  bank  profitability, and  their  capital  adequacy  (to  12.5 percent,  exceeding  the  10\npercent prescribed minimum), as well as to some improvement in asset quality and banking\nsystem liquidity. However, progress in banking system reforms was overshadowed in early\n1998 by the failed merger of RB and Golomt Bank. This diverted resources needed for financial\nsector reforms and delayed the progress of financial sector restructuring. Imprudent lending,\nand poor management and internal controls generated heavy losses for RB.\n21. From July 1998 and throughout the six-month hiatus under a caretaker government, reforms\nslowed. In December 1998, the Parliament appointed the current Government. In February 1999, a\nbank restructuring action plan, was agreed to by the Government, ADB, IMF, and the United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID). Under this plan, the management of three insolvent\nbanks, AB, BITI, and RB, were removed and replaced by conservators in February-May 1999.\nReorganization  plans  were  approved  and  implemented,  leading  to  operational  and  financial\nrestructuring. Shareholders in AB and BITI were asked to increase the capital (RB is state-owned),\nand following the negative response, shareholders\u2019 capital was written down to cover the losses. In\nOctober 1999, BOM placed BITI and RB under receivership, revoked their licenses, and proceeded\nwith an orderly liquidation of the two banks. In the case of AB, a receiver was appointed in October,\nand a restructuring plan was approved to rehabilitate the bank.\n22. Despite a difficult political environment and the severe external supply shocks induced\nby the combined effects of the Asian and Russian Crises in 1997 and 1998, by December 1999,\nthe Government had satisfactorily complied with the reform program under the FSP (footnote\n1).9 Notable achievements under the FSP include the adoption and enforcement of improved\nprudential regulations and supervision, and steps to facilitate debt recovery and eliminate bank\ninsolvency.  The  FSP  also  supported  strengthening  market  discipline  by  reducing  state\ninvolvement in the management of banks10 and tightening enforcement of banking laws to\naddress the pervasive default culture. This was also intended to improve the debt recovery\nproblems largely responsible for the large share of nonperforming loans and weak asset quality\n                                               \n9\n  The Progress Report (footnote 3) provides a detailed assessment of financial sector reforms implemented under\nthe FSP.\n10\n  State involvement in the banking system was exercised directly through state ownership of banks and indirectly\nby influencing lending policies through directed credit programs.", "7\nin the banking system. Bank restructuring activities were a central focus of the FSP and after a\nslow start, 8 (of 20) banks were closed from June 1998 to December 1999. In addition, and to\nprevent the entry of weak banks, licensing requirements were strengthened and minimum bank\npaid-in capital was increased (para. 27). Supplementary Appendix B presents data on banking\nsystem indicators.\nb. Constraints and Issues\n23. Notwithstanding these improvements, the banking system remains fragile. The second\nphase of banking reform is now directed at addressing structural problems with the objective of\nstrengthening financial intermediation in the economy. A healthy banking system will support\nefficient intermediation and improve growth prospects of the economy. To lay firm foundations\nfor the development of a sound and stable financial system, the following systemic weaknesses\nneed to be addressed.\ni. High Intermediation Cost\n24. The fundamental issue to be addressed by the FSRP is to lay the groundwork for the\nreduction  of  the  high  intermediation  spreads  in  the  banking  system.  The  spreads  are\nsymptomatic of general distress in the banks reflecting the increased risks of default, high\noperating costs, and large stock of nonperforming assets in the banks\u2019 portfolios. Short-term,\ndomestic  currency  loans  are  being  contracted  at  annual  (nominal)  average  interest  rates\nranging from 24 to 47 percent, and banks pay annual (nominal) average deposit rates on\ndomestic currency time deposits of about 10 to 30 percent. Despite a significant reduction in\ninflation over the past two years, only recently has there been a fall in the central bank bills rate\n(benchmark monetary policy instrument) which is now at 11 percent compared with 20 percent\nin April 1999. In addition, limited availability of marketable collateral has constrained lending\nactivities throughout the banking system. Improving asset quality in the system and ensuring\ntimely access to secured collateral will be key to relaxing credit constraints, reducing interest\nspreads, and improving financial intermediation.\nii. Regulatory Forbearance\n25. Faced with what was an undercapitalized banking system, the central bank has focused\non restoring the health of problem banks by facilitating their  recapitalization  through  profit\nretention  and/or  debt  write-offs.  However,  political  pressures  together  with  continued  lax\nlending, limited supervision capabilities, and weak legal enforcement for debt recovery have\naggravated the problem of nonperforming loans. Ad hoc liquidity support to insolvent banks\nunder lender of last resort arrangements, reinforced by the absence of explicit safety nets in the\nbanking system, has led to direct Government involvement through bailouts. This has resulted\nin a large fiscal restructuring cost of approximately 5 percent of GDP over the past four years.\niii. Weak  Governance  and  Internal  Controls  in  the  Banking\nSystem\n26. Banks are poorly managed and have limited commercial orientation. State-owned banks are\noperated by managers who were trained under the old system based on directed lending that was\nsubject  to  political  interference.  Newly  privatized  banks  are  owned  by  individuals  who  view\nownership primarily as a means to finance their business activities over any other priority. In addition\nto insider lending, lending to related parties continues and is often supported by less stringent credit\nevaluation, or other privileges at times exceeding the regulatory limit. In other instances, loans have\ncontinued to flow to companies despite debt-servicing problems. In the absence of qualified bank", "8\nmanagers, internal oversight is weak with lack of understanding of rules of responsibility and weak\nenforcement of checks and balances. The limited disclosure and reporting requirements together\nwith the absence of effective accountability perpetuates bad management.\niv. Limited Incentives Framework to Support the Development of\nStrong Banks\n27. The development of a core, sound banking system is constrained by lax bank entry\nconditions,  weak  regulatory  oversight,  and  the  absence  of  a  clear  bank  exit  strategy.  In\nSeptember 1999, the minimum bank paid-in capital was raised to Tug1 billion from Tug400\nmillion (and is to be raised to Tug2 billion for all banks under the FSAC effective June 2001).\nBank licensing is not subject to standard testing based on \u201cfit and proper\u201d11 conditions; this\nerodes the development of sound banks with strong management. Despite attempts to use the\npower of the law to deal with negligence and malfeasance on the part of bank owners which\ncaused bankruptcy, the weak legal and regulatory framework and the attendant moral hazard\nproblem continue to present major hurdles to developing a healthy banking system. On the\nregulatory side, there is limited scope to take advance and effective prior action in the case of\nearly warnings of bank distress. There is no bank insolvency law in place (although a draft law\nhas  been  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA)  nor  any  prompt  corrective  action  program  linking\nremedial trigger actions to specific capital targets. To strengthen the banking system, it is critical\nthat the Government adopt a bank exit strategy that is incentive compatible, places ultimate\nresponsibility for bank failure on the owners, and stresses prompt action to resolve failed banks.\nv. Limited Reach of Financial Services\n28. The banking system provides a narrow range of financial instruments usually limited to\ndemand, savings, and time deposits on the liabilities side. Government bonds and treasury and\ncentral bank bills dominate assets. In the absence of a functioning interbank market, financial\nmarket are generally not liquid. Loans are concentrated in few enterprises and often confined to\nbetter-known firms. Difficulties in registering and accessing even the limited types of property as\nloan collateral due to institutional and legal constraints further undermines lending activities.\nTerm finance is unavailable; the usual practice to overcome this problem is to continue rolling\nover short-term loans. This generates maturity mismatch and  increases overall  risk  in  the\nbanking system. In the rural areas, formal lending is even more constrained than in the urban\nareas. Prior to 1999, the rural areas were serviced by AB, and will be partly serviced by the\nMongol Post Bank (BOM has issued lending licenses to Mongol Post Bank in five aimags\n[provinces]) and AB (upon successful restructuring and recapitalization). The newly formed\nsavings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs)  and  finance  companies  offer  a  new  channel  for\nincreasing the provision of financial services in the rural areas. The pawnshops provide the bulk\nof informal lending. Secondary markets in existing assets are thin, and raising equity through\nthe stock market is not yet a viable option for the corporate sector.\n2. Nonbank Financial Sector\n29. Mongolia\u2019s NBF sector, at a nascent stage of development, comprises SCCs, finance\ncompanies, and leasing companies. SCCs were reintroduced in Mongolia in 1997 following what\nwas an extended use of credit cooperatives prior to 1991. In three years, 32 SCCs were licensed.\nSCCs are registered and affiliated to two competing and separate associations, or federations of\nSCCs. These include the National Confederation of Savings and Credit Cooperatives with 21\n                                               \n11\n  \u201cFit and proper\u201d conditions require the regulator to ensure that bank management has the necessary knowledge,\nbackground, and experience to operate a bank.", "9\nmembers and the Association of Savings and Credit Cooperative with 11 members. In addition, all\nSCCs are registered with the tax office.\n30. SCCs provide loans ranging between $500 and $3,000 according to the needs of their\nmembers. Loans tend to be used for trade finance and seed capital for business start-ups. Lending\nrates generally reflect cost of capital; however they are lower than rates charged by pawnshops.\nThe SCCs, like all forms of cooperatives, are basically operating as self-regulatory organizations as\nallowed for under the Cooperatives Act, and are governed by their members according to the rule:\none member, one vote.\n31. The number of SCCs has been rapidly increasing; in 1999 21 new licenses were issued.\nThis expansion largely reflects the difficulties small firms and households face, in gaining access to\ncredit from banking institutions. Given Mongolia\u2019s small capital base and small and widely dispersed\npopulation, SCCs are  well suited to lend especially in rural areas where maintaining an extensive\nbranch banking network may not be a viable option. Most SCCs have been established in urban\ncenters, and it is expected that these will soon expand into rural areas.\n32. Although SCCs by virtue of their small size are not a potential source of systemic risk,\nthere is practically no regulatory oversight other than informal means of enforcing discipline through\npeer (member) pressure. Some SCCs have already failed, and if this subsector is to expand,\nconfidence must be built by bringing them under systematic supervision and regulation. To avoid\nany ensuing regulatory fragmentation and coordination failures, and the cost implications of starting\nup a new institution, BOM should provide regulatory oversight of SCCs.\n33. In 1999, following BOM\u2019s approval of basic regulations on finance companies (non-\ndeposit-taking institutions), BOM licensed operations of two finance companies. Licenses were\nissued to (i) a former bank, Bayanbogd Bank, that was unable to meet the minimum paid-in capital\nrequirement (Tug1 billion) and (ii) a former cooperative, Golden Fund, which was supported by\nMicro Start, a program of the United Nations Development Programme. Golden Fund has grown\nquite rapidly over the past six months successfully expanding operations. Golden Fund intends to\ndevelop as a microlending institution. Several nongovernment organizations have been supporting\nGolden Fund, including the National Association of Mongolia Agricultural Cooperatives, LEOS (a\nwomen\u2019s organization), Mongolia Women\u2019s Federation, rotary clubs (Ulaanbaatar), Open Society\n(Soros), and Local Development Fund. Golden Fund has lending operations in Ulaanbaatar, Khentii,\nand Dornogobi aimags, and provides loans of up to $300 at interest rates of 5-7 percent monthly,\nwith 1-10 months tenure through five branches. As of December 1999, Golden Fund had a loan\nportfolio of Tug1 billion covering some 5,000 loans. Its loan portfolio consists of trading loans\n(70 percent),  small-scale  manufacturing  loans  (20  percent),  and  loans  in  the  services  sector\n(10 percent). The lending operations to date have registered a repayment rate of 98 percent. The\nchallenge facing Golden Fund is how to expand activities and remain commercially viable as it faces\nnonconcessional sources of financing and will have to operate under market conditions. Two new\nfinance companies were licensed in 2000, namely Gobi Initiative (supported by USAID) and Mongol\nCredit (supported by TACIS).\n34. Finance companies are expected to focus on small lending activities, primarily business\nloans in urban areas. BOM regulations prohibit finance companies from deposit taking. This is\nexpected to limit their ability to leverage funds and inhibit their intermediation functions. Finance\ncompanies are not expected to compete with banks  for  the  same  clientele,  but  instead,  are\nexpected to develop small lending niche markets. Nevertheless, they need to operate within a\nsound prudential regulatory framework including capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, and other\nstandard  prudential  requirements.  There  are  two  financial  leasing  companies,  Boddi  Leasing\nCompany  and  Orchid  Leasing  Company.  Until  recently,  the  supervision  of  financial  leasing", "10\ncompanies was subject to uncertainty due to the debate between BOM and the Ministry of Finance\n(MOF) about which institution should be vested with this responsibility. Although BOM has now\nbeen vested with this responsibility, there has been little progress over the past two years in\nintroducing minimum prudential standards and improved reporting requirements. The Supervision\nDepartment of BOM needs to be strengthened; otherwise enforcement capabilities will be severely\ntested.\n35. Finally, various leasing companies have been operating for the past few years. These\ncompanies are mostly dealing with leasing of durable goods, plant, and equipment, and are not\nsubject to any systematic oversight by a designated regulatory agency. Supplementary Appendix C\npresents some key data on nonbank financial companies.\n3. Capital Markets\na. Background\n36. Relatively smaller than the banking system, capital market activity started in 1991 with\nthe  establishment  of  the  Government-owned  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE).  A  major\nimpetus to the stock market was provided by the privatization of SOEs during 1991-1994: SOE\ninvestment coupons were allocated to more than 2 million citizens for the purpose of trading on\nthe MSE. About 1.2 million citizens became shareholders of 470 companies. In September\n1994,  the Securities Law of  Mongolia  was  enacted, followed  by  the  establishment  of  the\nMongolian Securities and Exchange Commission (MSEC). The Partnership and Company Law\nwas enacted in May 1995, and amended in August 1999 as the Company Law.\n37. MSEC was established by the Government in 1995 to regulate and monitor securities\nmarket trading.   It has a Board of five commissioners \u2013 the chairperson is nominated by the\nPrime Minister; one member is nominated by the minister of finance, another by the governor of\nBOM; and two are nominated by the Parliament. All commissioners serve for a 5-year term.\nMSEC is also responsible for implementing the Securities Law and other legislative acts and\nprocedures, protecting investor interests, enforcing disclosure requirements, and carrying out\neducational and public awareness programs.\n38. The MSE operates as a nonprofit (i.e., profits revert to the national budget) and self-\nregulatory organization. It has six departments and employs over 60 staff. The Trading and\nInformation Department is responsible for organizing the trading and dissemination of market\ninformation to investors.  The Listing and Supervision Department receives applications from\ncompanies to be listed on the MSE, oversees disclosure of financial and material information;\nand implements supervision of trading, clearing, and settlement transactions. The Clearing,\nSettlement and Depository Department is set up to provide  a book-entry  clearing  system.\nUnder this system, shares deposited by securities companies and other participants are held in\nthe central depository. Clients in turn must have only one account in the central depository, and\nmust use member securities companies as intermediaries. All stock trading at the MSE is\nsettled the business day following the day of the transaction (T+1).\n39. Active secondary trading on the MSE started in August 1995. At present, there are 418\ncompanies listed, of which 324 are privatized enterprises. The market capitalization, as of\nFebruary 2000, was $37 million, close to 4 percent of GDP, down from $53 million in early 1998.\nTrading activity has declined sharply over the last year, as evidenced by the drop in average\ndaily  trading from  $25,000  in  September 1998  to  about  $13,000  in  January  2000.  Listed\ncompanies are classified according to one of three categories, A, B, or C, based upon standard\nindicators of asset quality such as price/earnings ratios, and liquidity of the shares.  Currently", "11\nthe majority of the listed companies are classified in C (or lowest) category. These companies\nare supported by 41 securities brokerage companies,  a central depository agency and a\nclearing agency. No foreign companies are listed on the MSE, although the conditions and\nrequirements for foreign companies are the same as for domestic companies.\n40. To promote foreign investment, no tax is imposed on the dividend and profit gained from\nstock trading (however, a new law that will  tax dividends and profit from securities trading will\nbecome effective January 2001). In addition, repatriation of profits and dividends, as well as\nproceeds from the sale of assets and securities is permitted.\nb. Constraints and Issues\n41. While steps have been taken to develop the securities industry, the capital market is still\nat a nascent stage of development. Major supply-side issues include a small corporate sector\nand slow progress in privatizing the remaining 95 SOEs, the largest of which are likely to be\nsold to strategic  investors outside  of  the  MSE.12  So far  there  have  been  no  initial public\nofferings.  On the demand side, limited capacity of MSEC to serve as an effective policymaker\nand regulator has dampened investor confidence, and indicates the need for considerable\ninstitutional strengthening. Of late, there have been cases of collusion among brokers and\ndealers to influence price movements on the MSE, further undermining investor confidence.\n42. Securities companies are generally weak. Minimum authorized capital of a securities\ncompany according to the Company Law is Tug1 million for a limited liability company and\nTug10 million for a joint stock company. Admission fee into the MSE is Tug5 million (paid once)\nand  the  annual  membership  fee  Tug1  million.  More  recently  and  following  the  economic\ndownturn, there have been calls to lower the annual membership fee, although administration of\nthe MSE has not yet conceded to these demands.\n43. Following  the fall  in  market  capitalization and  because  of  the  difficulty  to  maintain\nprofitability, surviving securities companies have reacted to the market downturn by following a\ngrowth strategy based on charging large trading commissions. These are currently set at 5\npercent of the share price on any buy or sell order. A \u201cround trip\u201d leading to a buy and eventual\nsell will imply an investor\u2019s reservation value on expected gains of at least 10 percent. These\nhigh transactions costs, which are tantamount to a tax on securities trading, represent a serious\nimpediment to fostering a vibrant securities market. The new regulations should clearly focus on\nthe larger interests of the securities industry as a whole and not protect the interests of a\nparticular group. In addition, securities companies which are financially weak need to strengthen\ntheir balance sheets in parallel with the strengthening of their commercial orientation in order to\ndevelop into professional client-based premier service providers.\n44. On the supply side, over the short- to medium-term, the development of capital markets\nis closely linked to the success of the Government\u2019s privatization program. Following a lull in the\n1994-1996 privatization program, in 1997 the Government launched a second phase of the\nprivatization program after passage of the new Privatization Law. The implementation of the\n1997-2000 privatization program has led to the privatization of some 900 SOEs raising total\nprivatization proceeds of Tug41 billion. A new privatization program is expected to be approved\nfollowing the formation of the new Government. Currently, many of the strategic SOEs are on a\nnegative list established by Parliament, thus preventing the Government from privatizing them.\n                                               \n12\nSeventeen large, most-valuable SOEs are on a separate list, that will be approved by Parliament on a case-by-\ncase basis. These include TDB, Neft Petroleum Import Concern, Gobi Company, Erdenet Mining Corporation,\nMongol Daatgal Insurance Company, Mongolian Stock Exchange, and MIAT Mongolian Airlines, (para. 44).", "12\nUnder the arrangement, any proposal to privatize the companies on the negative list will have to\nbe presented  to  Parliament on a  case  by  case  basis.  The  measure  reflects  Parliament\u2019s\ninsistence on having a role in the divestment of SOEs in strategic sectors, given the sensitive\nnature of some of the most valuable companies rather than opposition to privatization. The\n2000-2003 privatization program is likely to be as strong as the 1997-2000 program. It is\nexpected that the sale of a part of these stocks through the MSE will strengthen investor interest\nin the stock exchange.\n45. While the legal framework for establishing companies is in place, many enterprises have\nrecently  been  changing  their  legal  status  from  joint-stock  companies  to  limited  liability\ncompanies,  without  changes  to  their  shareholding  structure.  Such  practices  reduce\ntransparency and act against good corporate governance; in particular, they result in further\nneglect of the small shareholder\u2019s interests.  The protection of investors\u2019 interests is critical to\nfostering increased demand for tradable stocks.  While the draft Securities Law does include\nactions to support protection of small investors\u2019 interests, implementation will take time. The\ndraft law also gives greater power to MSEC to strengthen monitoring and enforce regulations.\nHowever, the institutional capacity at MSEC is weak. Unless there is a commitment from the\nGovernment to provide additional resources and improve supervisory and regulatory skills at\nMSEC, enforcement will be compromised. Public awareness of the benefits and risks of the\nequities and debt markets together with efforts to restructure and improve MSEC, including\nimproved accounting standards and timely flow of information, will also need to be strengthened\nto inspire greater investor confidence.\n46. In addition, there is currently no legal basis for the development of institutional investors.\nLegislation, regulations, and guidelines for their operations including  investment funds  and\ntrusts  will  have  to  be developed.  The  establishment  of  the  legal  infrastructure  to  support\ninstitutional investors will lead to the eventual integration of contractual savings institutions in\ncapital market development through pension and insurance funds, and enhance the prospects\nof longer-term sources of finance.  Finally, Mongolia is unique in terms of its Government-owned\nstock  exchange;  the  question  of  whether  capital  markets  can  be  made  more  vibrant  by\nprivatizating the MSE must be examined. Supplementary Appendix D presents statistics on\ncapital market indicators.\n4. Pension System\na. Background\n47. The development of the capital market will benefit from reform of the pension system to\nensure its social and fiscal sustainability. Mongolia\u2019s pension system is modeled on a pay-as-\nyou-go system under which current generations contribute to meeting the pension obligations of\nretired workers. The Pension Fund, which is one of five social security funds, operates on a 19.0\npercent contribution from the wages of employed workers and 9.5 percent contribution of self-\nemployed earnings.13 For the nongovernment sectors, employers contribute 13.5 percent of\ntheir  wages,  and  employees  5.5  percent;  whereas  government  employees  contribute\n1.1 percent of their wages with government contributing 17.9 percent. Coverage is mandatory,\nwith the exception of the self-employed and herders. Significant transfers from the Government\nbudget supplement these pension contributions, which are not accumulated or invested, in order\n                                               \n13\nThe other components of social insurance, with the respective employer-employee contributions from the wages,\ninclude social benefits insurance (1.0 percent each), work injury insurance (1.0-3.0 percent contributed by the\nemployer), unemployment insurance (0.5 percent each) and health insurance (3.0 percent each). The self-\nemployed contributions to these schemes are 1.0 percent, no unemployment contributions, and a fixed sum of\nTug800 for health coverage.", "13\nto meet the current pension obligations. The collection of contributions and payment of benefits\nare administered by the State Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO). Like other transition\neconomies, the pension system has been affected by the (i) growing number of unfunded\nliabilities; (ii) contribution arrears, particularly from state-owned bodies; and (iii) narrow base of\npension contributions relative to recipients (low replacement rate). Supplementary Appendix E\npresents data on pension funds.\nb.  Constraints and Issues\n48. To address these issues, the Government pension plan aims to introduce notionally\ndefined individual pension accounts. The Law on Individual Pension Accounts, adopted by\nParliament on 11 June 1999, provides that workers born after 1 January 1960 will be given\nindividual  pension  accounts  indicating  their  past  pension  contributions  with  effect  from\n1 January 2000.14  One of the critical elements in the Government's decision to introduce partial\nfunding was the need to ensure a proper balance between the long-run fiscal sustainability of\nthe pension system vis-\u00e0-vis intergenerational equity. While the new law will result in changes to\nthe benefit structure for many groups in the population, depending on years of service and the\ncurrent privileges they enjoy, the truncation is based on sound actuarial analysis to weigh the\nnet cash-flow generation under various reform options. The cost of the program of individual\naccounts under the chosen truncation date is likely to grow more slowly over time relative to\nGDP than alternate reform options, although the projections are subject to the assumptions\nbeing realized. USAID has provided TA support to help develop administrative systems to\nintroduce notional individual accounts. The annual returns to the individual contributions will be\ndetermined by SSIGO. While the new system will enable pension payments to be closely linked\nto contributions, the pension fund will be unfunded for the foreseeable future. The Government\nplans to invest a part of the contributions of the younger workers in the domestic  capital\nmarkets. The Government also plans to introduce nonstate voluntary pensions to supplement\nthe current first pillar pension provisions.\n49. While a credible reform plan has been formulated by the Government with USAID TA\nsupport, several critical issues need to be resolved. If the reform program is to be effective, the\ncreation of individual accounts has to be followed by the introduction of partial funding. In this\nregard, the actual process and timing of the transition to partial funding and the associated costs\nneed to be carefully worked out. The investment potential in domestic capital markets is not yet\nclear,  and  needs  to  be  examined.  The  Government\u2019s  recent  announcement  to  increase\npensions to equalize the benefits between the pre- and post-1995 retirees has introduced some\ncomplexities  in  the  process  of  benefit  calculations.  At  present  there  is  no  law  governing\nsupplementary nonstate pensions; the passage of such law is crucial in light of plans being\nformulated by the NBFIs to offer voluntary retirement savings products.15\n                                               \n14\nThe individual contributions will be determined by the individual\u2019s length of service in the work force, his/her\nmonthly average wage calculated over the best five years\u2019 of earnings during a consecutive 10-year period prior\nto the establishment of the individual account on 1 January 2000, and an average index of the national average\nwage in the last five years.\n15  The experience of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Loan 1589-KAZ: Pension Reform Program, for $100 million,\napproved on 15 December 1997) demonstrates the need to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework as\nwell as implement broad-ranging capital market reforms prior to embarking on pension reforms. In this regard,\nand particularly given the nascent state of capital markets in Mongolia, it is critical to ensure that the gradual\nconversion of the individual accounts from notional to real is undertaken with due care to the investment options.", "14\n5. Insurance Industry\na. Background\n50. The  insurance  sector  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development.  The  state  insurance\ncompany,  Mongol  Daatgal,  was  established  in  1934,  and  has  been  wielding  significant\nmonopoly power in the industry. The law governing insurance activities was enacted only in\n1997. At present, there are 11 insurance companies, including Mongol Daatgal, of which 9 are\nprivate. The Insurance Supervision Unit (ISU) of MOF is responsible for all policy, legal, and\nregulatory activities governing  the  insurance  industry.  ISU  has  a  staff  of  three  officers  at\npresent,  although  there  are  provisions  under  the  law for  the establishment  of aimag-level\ninsurance  supervision  offices.  ISU\u2019s  operational  and  regulatory  capacities  need  to  be\nsignificantly strengthened to help develop contractual savings institutions in Mongolia.\nb. Constraints and Issues\n51. Mongolia has an underdeveloped insurance sector.  While there has been long history\nwith insurance products, the growth of industry is affected by low level of incomes, lack of\nawareness  of  public  to  the  significance  and  benefits  of  insurance  sector,    and    lack  of\noperational and regulatory capacity in the industry. Besides considerable regulatory support,\npolicy and operational assistance is needed. There are no prudential requirements governing\nsolvency in the industry at present, barring minimum capital requirements of Tug100 million\n($95,000). Investment guidelines for insurance companies need to be strengthened as capital\nmarkets gradually develop in the country.\nB.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n52. As the lead coordinator of the financial sector thematic group, IDA has supported BOM\nto develop the Government\u2019s long-term vision and a medium-term strategy for the financial\nsector. The objective of the Government\u2019s long-term vision is to double the size of the sector\n(assets as a percentage of GDP) in 10 years by ensuring the following:\n(i) The role of the state will be directed to ensuring macroeconomic and financial\nsector stability; the state will intervene only in circumstances when market forces\npatently fail to work.\n(ii) There  is  an effective,  autonomous  central  bank  and a  legal framework  that\nrequires good prudential regulation, corporate governance, and supervision and\nprompt corrective action (i.e., the closure of banks when the capital adequacy\nratio declines below a certain minimum level).\n(iii) A relatively small number of sound and efficient domestic and foreign banks will\nemerge  and  will  be  capable  of  providing  efficient  banking  services  in  a\ncompetitive environment.\n(iv) Ownership of all commercial banks will be transferred to the private sector.\n(v) Basic payment and banking services are available to meet demand outside of\nUlaanbaatar  through  a  variety  of  channels  (e.g.,  microfinance  institutions,\nregional cooperatives, private banks).", "15\n(vi) The financial sector will have a cadre of banking and related personnel trained in\ninternational best practices.\n(vii) The  legal  environment  for  conducting  financial  activities  and  accounting\nstandards  will  be  rigorously  enforced,  with  the  aim  of  strengthening  public\nconfidence in financial institutions.\n(viii) There is a  growing number of  NBFIs  (e.g., finance and  leasing  companies,\ncontractual savings institutions, cooperatives, and microfinance companies) to\nhelp meet the demand for savings and investment.\n(ix) A healthy and well-governed capital market will be developed to complement\nbanking.\n53. To implement this long-term vision effectively, the Government has adopted a medium-\nterm strategy for the financial sector to\n(i) establish  the  foundations  of  a  market-based  financial  system,  including  the\ndevelopment of modern banking skills, enhancement of auditing and accounting\nstandards, enforcement of financial contracts, and establishment of an exit policy\nfor troubled banks;\n(ii) signal the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  uphold  rights  and  obligations  under\nfinancial contracts, beginning with the timely servicing of interest payments on\nGovernment bonds held by banks;\n(iii) reduce the pervasive role of the state in allocating financial resources\u2014until the\nrevocation of the licenses in December 1999 of the deeply insolvent BITI and RB,\nGovernment-controlled banks accounted for about 90 percent of the assets in the\nbanking system;\n(iv) facilitate  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  financial  institutions  to  provide\npayment systems and banking services appropriate to conditions existing in the\nsparsely populated country;\n(v) prompt the consolidation of the banking system by doubling the minimum capital\nrequirement of banks to Tug2 billion (about $1.9 million);\n(vi) strengthen the legal framework for effective supervision and regulation by the central\nbank, including the requirement for prompt corrective action;\n(vii) develop a resolution and liquidation framework for failed banks;\n(viii) provide the foundations for the development of a market for Government bonds and\nan interbank market;\n(ix) strengthen corporate governance in the financial sector by encouraging banks to\nfollow international standards, such as the guidelines on corporate governance in\nbanking institutions issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS);\n(x) foster a healthy capital market by carrying out reforms in the MSE and MSEC to\nenhance investor confidence; and", "16\n(xi) institute a regulatory mechanism to guide the development of the NBF sector.\n54. ADB\u2019s FSP II and IDA\u2019s FSAC are critical components to support the Government\u2019s\nFSRP, and help implement the Medium-Term Financial Sector Development Strategy.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n55. Mongolia has received significant support from external financiers to develop its financial\nsector.  In the past, ADB has played a lead role in the financial sector. It has provided total\nassistance of $35 million for the  FSP; nine TA grants for banking for $3.7 million; a TA loan of\n$3 million for upgrading banking skills, which is still ongoing; and three TAs for capital markets\nfor $300,000.\n56. IMF has in place a three-year arrangement under the poverty reduction growth facility\n(PRGF) formerly ESAF for SDR33.4 million. The second annual arrangement under the PRGF for\nSDR14.8 million was approved in June 1999. The first review under the second arrangement was\ncompleted by the Board in January 2000, and performance was rated satisfactory. First quarter\n2000, macroeconomic data suggest that macroeconomic performance is good, however, the impact\nof the Zud will place added pressure on the macroeconomic program for the remainder of the year\nand the Government may need to take corrective actions to meet the financing requirements\nresulting from the Zud. At the time of printing the review of the second arrangement of PRGF is\nunder way. The second annual component of the PRGF included financial sector reforms focusing\nin particular on bank restructuring activities that built upon the work undertaken by the FSP. Under\nthe program of reforms, two banks have been closed and are under liquidation, and a third is under\nreceivership and being restructured for the purpose of privatization. The IMF program has also\nsupported continued fiscal consolidation and strengthening of tax administration, budget control, and\nmanagement.\n57. IDA is supporting the development of Mongolia\u2019s private enterprise and financial sectors\nunder a private sector development credit ($12 million) approved in May 1999. This credit line is\nchanneled through TDB and Golomt Bank. Through the FSAC,  IDA is sharing the financing of the\nFSRP with ADB (para. 6).\n58. The TA program of USAID has provided bank restructuring experts for AB, BITI, and RB,\nsupported the financial audits of these banks, and helped with the technical work for privatizing\nTDB. USAID has also funded a TA project for pension reforms to strengthen the institutional and\nlegal building blocks to develop the pension system in Mongolia; it is to be completed in 2000.\nAssistance has also been provided to support the development of a microcredit institution. Finally,\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit has supported the strengthening of AB, and Japan\nBank for International Cooperation has provided a number of advisers to support strengthening of\nrural credit, payment systems, and commercial banking. Details on external assistance for the\nfinancial sector is provided in Supplementary Appendix F.\n59. ADB envisages involvement in three sector lending operations that support the financial\nsector. These include the proposed (i) Agriculture Sector Development Program (2000), (ii) Rural\nFinance Project (2001),16 and (iii) Housing Sector Finance Project (2001). During the processing of\nthe FSP II, activities have been coordinated and efforts made to reinforce possible policy actions to\ncomplement these projects. Another ADB project, the Social Safety Net Development Program\n                                               \n16\n  An improved supervisory and regulatory framework for SCCs supported by the FSP II will promote an enabling\nenvironment for the development of SCCs expanding the outreach of financial services throughout the country,\nand which is expected to set the groundwork for the Rural Finance Project.", "17\n(SSNDP) (2000), will address social concerns by supporting the development of a social safety net,\nthrough unemployment insurance and disability protection. Pension systems will not be included\nunder the SSNDP. ADB has been in policy discussions with SSIGO and USAID for some time on\nstrengthening financial management of the pension system and improving financial sustainability of\nthe pension scheme.  In view of the increasing unfunded liabilities in the pension system, these\naspects will take priority over extending additional benefits under the system for the present.\nAccordingly, and in view of ADB\u2019s increasing focus on building-in social concerns in pension\noperations, this division of responsibilities between the SSNDP and the FSP II (i.e., pension system\nreforms will be addressed under the FSP II) is considered justified and effective.  Coordination of\nactivities between these two projects will continue in the future.\n60. In 1999, to ensure effective donor coordination in the financial sector, the Government\ninvited funding bodies to form a thematic group and prepare the financial sector strategy with\nsupport of the World Bank. The financial sector strategy lays down the long-term vision and\nmedium-term strategy for financial sector development. Drawing from this, the Government has\nworked closely with ADB and IDA to develop the FSRP (para. 6). ADB and IDA will launch joint\nperiodic monitoring of the FSRP, and the two institutions will closely consult with each other on\nthe performance of their respective FSP II and FSAC programs prior to tranche releases to\nachieve  common  evaluation of overall  FSRP  implementation.  This  will  be  reflected  in  the\nmemorandum of understanding to be entered into by both institutions.\nD. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  Country  Operational Strategy\n61. The main objective of the country operational strategy is to foster economic growth and\nreduce poverty by (i) focusing on income and employment generation through private sector\ndevelopment, and (ii) promoting good governance as an overarching economywide objective for\nthe strategy. The strategy identifies five core sectors including the financial sector, for ADB\nsupport. The strengthening of financial sector would help (i) remove the fragility of the banking\nsystem  to  facilitate  growth  of  private  sector  investment  and  savings,  and  (ii)  develop\nmicrofinance schemes. Special emphasis will be on governance reforms within the sector to\nintroduce  greater  transparency  and  accountability  at  all  levels  of  financial  institutions  and\noperations. The financial sector strategy will support poverty reduction primarily by developing\nmicrofinance services and promoting private sector-led economic growth.\n2. ADB\u2019s Program Lending Performance\n62. Since Mongolia joined ADB in 1991, ADB has provided support for most sectors of the\neconomy. Despite economic uncertainty, fiscal constraints, and institutional weaknesses in all\nsectors, ADB\u2019s portfolio in Mongolia is, in general, performing satisfactorily and implementation\nis proceeding on schedule. A high proportion of ADB lending has been through program loans\n(28.6 percent by number and 32 percent by amount) in view of the need to support structural\nadjustment.  Release  of  the  second  tranches  of  program  loans  in  the  finance,  industry,\nagriculture,  and  education  sectors  has  been  generally  on  track  which  demonstrates  the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment and capacity to implement complex policy and sector reforms in a\ndifficult domestic and international environment.\n3.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy\n63. ADB  has  been  supporting  financial  sector  reforms  in  Mongolia  since  1991.  The\nemphasis of ADB\u2019s sector strategy has been to help Mongolia move from a monobanking", "18\nsystem characteristic of centrally planned economies to a modern two-tier banking system. The\ntechnical support provided has helped establish a conducive legal and regulatory environment\nto facilitate the development of a market-based and commercially oriented banking system. This\nhas involved strengthening the Banking Law, developing the framework for banking supervision\nand  prudential  regulations,  and  providing  institutional  development  for  BOM  and  selected\ncommercial banks through training and skills development. Although, the supporting financial\ninfrastructure is evolving, the banking system is under severe stress. External factors, such as\n(i) political instability and related difficulties in ensuring consensus on the implementation of\ndifficult policy decisions, such as bank closures; and (ii) recurrent supply-side shocks (i.e., the\nAsian  and  Russian  crises)  that  have  induced  losses  in  the  corporate  sector  have  added\npressure on the fragile banking system. Internal problems, including (i) weak governance of the\nfinancial sector; (ii) lack of experienced and well-trained staff to manage banks effectively, from\nsenior management to credit officers; and (iii) limited enforcement capacity at BOM and its\ninability  to  the  arrest  the  loan  default  culture17  have  led  until  recently  to  increasing\nnonperforming loans and a decline in performance of banks. These factors have adversely\naffected asset quality and contributed to erosion of confidence in the banking system.\n64. Keeping  these  issues  in  view, ADB\u2019s financial  sector  strategy  in  Mongolia  aims to\ndevelop  a  balanced,  competitive,  viable,  and  stable  financial  system  by  broadening  and\ndeepening  financial  reforms  to  improve  efficiency  in  the  intermediation  process.  ADB\u2019s\noperational strategy allows for broad-ranging support for the financial sector by\n(i)  strengthening financial sector policies and regulations;\n(ii)  improving financial sector governance by introducing greater transparency and\naccountability  at  all  levels  of  operations,  including  appropriate  checks  and\nbalances  to  effectively  prevent  abuses  by  shareholders  and  directors,  and\nstrengthening market discipline;\n(iii)  restructuring and privatizing banks to consolidate and develop reputable and role\nmodel financial institutions;\n(iv)  developing  equity  and  debt  markets,  reforming  the  pension  system,  and\nsupporting  the  development  of  finance,  financial  leasing,  and  insurance\ncompanies;\n(v)  extending credit by developing onlending operations for small and medium-sized\nenterprises, rural enterprises, households, microfinance, and housing purposes;\nand\n(vi)  strengthening  the  efficiency  and  the  outreach  of  financial  intermediation  to\nsupport stable economic growth and poverty reduction.\nV .  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n65. The deficiencies of the financial system have potentially affected Mongolia\u2019s growth and\nmacroeconomic prospects. The banking crises have raised the cost of financial intermediation,\nwiped out public savings,  and  imposed  a heavy burden on the  budget  and  the economy\nbecause of the significant financial costs to restructure commercial banks. The development of\na sound, efficient, and well-regulated financial system that is market based is fundamental to\n(i) achieve higher and sustainable growth and help meet the country\u2019s social and economic\ndevelopment  objectives,  particularly  reduction  of  poverty,  as  well  as  (ii)  develop  a  robust\n                                               \n17\n  The  default  culture reflects  the  prevailing incentives  system that,  given  weak  prudential  regulations  and\nenforcement capabilities and lack of market discipline, perpetuates moral hazard.", "19\nfinancial sector with institutions that can withstand the challenges of exogenous shocks to which\nMongolia is vulnerable. A consolidated, resilient, and commercially viable banking system is\ncrucial to inducing efficiency in financial intermediation.  During the first phase of financial sector\nreforms (1997 to 1999), the Government adopted bold policy measures to address banking\nproblems.  These  included  (i) strengthening  the  prudential  regulations,  including  raising  the\ncapital adequacy of banks; (ii) developing the legal framework to allow for bank bankruptcies,\ni.e.,  conservatorship  and  receivership  of  banks;  (iii)  closing  eight  insolvent  banks;  and\n(iv) enhancing the drive for loan recovery.\n66. Despite these measures, the banking system is small and weak18 with 12 licensed\nbanks accounting for about $180 million of aggregate assets. The banks\u2019 distress19 has posed\nproblems of financial intermediation with supply of credit20 falling below requirements. Banks\nhave been primarily lending short-term at relatively large interest spreads,21 and have rolled\nover these loans that has resulted in maturity mismatch in the system. Past practices of directed\nlending,  reinforced  by  a  pervasive  loan  default  culture,  have  resulted  in  accumulation  of\nnonperforming assets (equivalent to 37 percent of the loan portfolio). Delays in Government\ninterest payments on bank restructuring bonds to banks have, in turn, aggravated cash-flow\nproblems and placed further stress on bank balance sheets and solvency. Furthermore, the\nbanking system has had to absorb the adverse supply-side shocks due to loan defaults that\nresulted from a significant fall in commodity prices and exports, thus worsening asset quality in\nthe banking system.\n67. While strengthening banking as the primary institution for deposit and lending activities is\na priority for the Government\u2019s financial sector development strategy, sole dependence on it\nresulted in stress and overextension of banks. The stock market is small and illiquid, and the\npension and insurance systems have played a limited role in terms of developing alternative\nsources  of  funds  to  finance  economic  growth.  The  Government  has  given  priority  to  the\ndevelopment  of  the  capital  market  and  contractual  savings  institutions  for  diversifying  the\nfinancial sector.\n68. The equity markets remain at an early stage of development, and have received little\nexternal assistance since ADB first supported the creation of the MSE in 1991. Strengthening\nthe equities market will enhance domestic resource mobilization and complement the banking\nsystem in developing long-term sources of funding for investment projects. Broadening and\ndeepening the MSE and improving its regulation would generate greater confidence in the\nmarket and facilitate the supply of tradable securities primarily through the privatization of\nSOEs. This, in turn, would stimulate greater demand from investors seeking better quality\nstocks.\n69. While  the  contractual  savings  reform  measures  that  were  initiated  in  1995  have\nimproved the financial health of the system to some extent, several of problems still exist, as in\nmany of the other transition economies. These include (i) large deficits and long-run funding\n                                               \n18\n  The ratio of bank assets to GDP has been falling over the past three years and stands at approximately\n20 percent.\n19\n  The three problem banks, namely AB, BITI and RB accounted for 56 percent of nonperforming loans in the banking\nsystem by late 1999. With ADB support, the three banks were placed under receivership in late 1999 and BOM has\ncommenced liquidation procedures at BITI and RB, a significant step in restructuring the banking system.\n20\n  M2 to GDP, an indicator of credit in the economy stands at 19 percent in 1999 down from 24 percent in 1995.\nDuring this period, currency to M2 (or the inverse of the money multiplier) has increased from 24 percent to 30\npercent. Ninety-five percent of total loans have maturities of less than one year.\n21\n  Interest spreads on local currency lending deposit range on average between 20 and 25 percent annually.", "20\ndifficulties as a result of the generous benefit structure; (ii) contribution arrears, particularly from\nSOEs,  due  partly  to  enforcement  problems  and  partly  to  poor  SOE  financial  health;\n(iii) inadequate coverage, given the difficulties of collecting pension contributions from informal\nsector workers and herders; (iv) significant underreporting of income for pension contributions\nand the absence of a link between pension contributions and receipts as benefits are based on\nthe last five years\u2019 of earnings; and (v) the narrow and declining base of pension contributors\nrelative to recipients.\n70. The  development  of  the  capital  markets  and  contractual  savings  are  important  to\nenhance domestic resource mobilization, increase the supply of long-term sources of financing,\nand deepen financial markets. In recent years, the number of credit cooperatives and new\nfinance companies has increased. To lay the foundation for development of the NBF sector, the\nGovernment plans  to  develop  a  proper  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  supervision\nframework for stable growth of the equity markets, and pension and insurance systems. These\nreforms will complement banking reforms with the objective of supporting balanced financial\nsector development as set forth in the Government\u2019s medium-term financial sector development\nstrategy. The Government has developed the FSRP, which consists of the FSAC and the FSP II\nto support the implementation of the strategy.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n71. The primary goal of the FSP II is to promote the development of a competitive, stable,\nand broad-based financial system to support enhanced resource mobilization and sustainable\neconomic growth. The FSP II will focus on the following activities:\n(i)  Improve financial intermediation processes by\n(a)  strengthening corporate governance of the banks in line with international\nbest practices;\n(b) improving the loan collateral system by allowing for different types of\nproperty over which a security interest can be created, and improving\nprocedures to allow for proper and easy registration and valuation of the\nproperty;\n(c) implementing a management information system (MIS) for the banks; and\n(d) developing interbank markets.\n(ii) Strengthen  prudential  regulations  and  supervisory  framework  for  the  NBF\nsubsector by\n(a) requiring  finance  companies  to  comply  with  risk-based  prudential\nregulations;\n(b) issuing accounting standards for NBFIs;\n(c) restructuring the Supervision Department of BOM to improve monitoring\nand enforcement of regulation of NBFIs; and\n(d) enacting amendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other required\nlegislation to vest BOM with oversight responsibility over savings and\ncredit cooperatives through second- and higher-tier credit associations.\n(iii)  Develop capital market infrastructure by\n(a) separating and privatizing the MSE, Central Depository System (CDS),\nand Securities Clearing System (SCS);", "21\n(b) strengthening operational and regulatory capacity at MSE;\n(c) strengthening the Securities Law; and\n(d) preparing a law on trusts and a law on investment funds.\n(iv) Develop the pension system by\n(a) transforming the current system to a partially funded system;\n(b) improving the administrative processes in SSIGO, including developing its\ncapabilities for pension payment collection, and strengthening financial\nmanagement of the pension system; and\n(c) introducing legislation to allow for the nonstate voluntary  pension system.\n(v) Strengthen the legal and regulatory reforms of the insurance system by\n(a) increasing minimum capital requirements for the insurance industry;\n(b) promoting liberal investment guidelines; and\n(c) increasing premium incomes.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n72. The policy matrix for the FSRP (Appendix 1) provides for actions envisaged under the\nFSAC and FSP II. In the case of the FSP II, the policy framework (Appendix 2) includes 4 prior\nactions, 13 conditions tied to the release of second tranche, and 21 other policy actions to be\ncompleted over a three-year period.\n1. Reform the Banking System\n73. The FSAC will focus on bank restructuring measures at AB and SB, as well as measures\nto (i) strengthen the bank regulatory framework including asset classification, bank licensing\nrequirements, bank exit strategy, and bank privatization (with a possible equity stake by ADB\u2019s\nprivate  sector  group);  (ii)  strengthen  banking  institutions,  namely  the  Mongolian  Asset\nRestructuring Agency and the Credit Information Bureau; and (iii) support capacity building and\nskills upgrading through a TA credit. The banking reforms under the FSP II will complement\nbanking reforms under the FSAC. These combined policy actions are expected to develop a\nbroad framework for the creation of a  stable  and  competitive banking  system.  This  is an\nimportant focus and agenda of the FSAC and builds on the progress made under past ADB\noperations.22  To  facilitate  coordination,  ADB  and  IDA  will  jointly  monitor  implementation\nprogress within FSRP (para. 57). The salient features of the FSRP and the synopsis of banking\nsystem reform measures envisaged under the FSRP banking-focused actions are presented in\nSupplementary Appendixes G and H.\n74. To support sustainability of the bank restructuring program, the FSP II aims to support\ndevelopment of (i) sound governance policies and structure, (ii) the regulatory framework for\nloan collateral, (iii) MIS for the banks, and (iv) interbank markets. These policy measures\nreinforce the FSAC policy framework.\n                                               \n22\n  The development of the financial sector in Mongolia as identified in the Government\u2019s long-term vision and\nmedium-term strategy, while not focusing on the sequential aspects of reforms, recognizes the importance of\ndeveloping a core banking system as a first priority to be complemented and succeeded by reforms focusing on\nthe development of (i) the NBF sector including capital markets and NBFIs; and (ii) contractual savings\ninstitutions.", "22\na.  Strengthen Corporate Governance in Banking Institutions\n75. Traditionally, state-owned banks operating under the old monobanking system focused\non providing directed lending mandated by the planning authority. Management of banks had to\nbe subservient to political goals, as decisions were subject to political interference. Private\nsector investments in banks will only be forthcoming if banks are generally viable entities and\nare able to generate returns on equity. The governance structure in private banks is critical to\nensure that these banks do not serve the personal ends of their owners (i.e., financing owners\u2019\nbusiness activities). The limited liability nature of banking institutions together with the absence\nof effective accountability and internal controls means there is a high risk that bad management\npractices will be perpetuated  to the detriment of the development of sound and efficient private\nbanks. Unless sound corporate governance is in place, banking supervision cannot function\neffectively.\n76. The FSP II will support the preparation of guidelines on best practices on corporate\ngovernance of commercial banks. The FSP II involves strengthening the commercial banks\nsupervisory boards and internal control mechanisms in line with the report of Basle Committee\non  Banking  Supervision  on  Enhancing  Corporate  Governance  for  Banking  Organizations.\nTransparency of banking system reporting mechanisms will be improved based on the IMF\nCode of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The associated\nTA will help develop a model charter for banks, and guidelines to encourage banks to prepare\nor amend their charters based on this model. Adoption of these policy measures by commercial\nbanks will help strengthen internal controls, and establish appropriate levels of accountability to\nfoster checks and balances.\nb. Improve Loan Collateral\n77. The lack of collateral and uncertainty concerning the registered value of the collateral,\nand the ability to recover the loan by enforcing the security have posed serious problems for\nfinancial intermediation and added to the cost of borrowing. The expected approval later this\nyear of amendments in the Civil Code to allow for movable property to be offered as loan\ncollateral will ease the constraints facing borrowers and the banks. However, the types of\nproperty  over  which  a  security  interest  can  be  created  must  be  further  expanded,  and\nprocedures for registering property improved to allow for proper and easier registration and\nvaluation of the property. The FSP II will support the preparation of a plan acceptable to ADB\nidentifying the types of property that can be used as collateral.\nc. Implement an MIS in Banks\n78. The existing MIS of the commercial banks is rudimentary and provides limited scope for\nproper treasury management, foreign exchange operations, and other activities. The current\nchart of accounts for banks separates loans and deposits by a combination of counterpart\nobligations (state, private, etc.), currency, and classification (past due, substandard, doubtful,\nand loss) categories.  This reflects the limitations of a manual statistical system. An automated\nsystem  would  limit  segregation  at  the  general  ledger  level  to  the  generic  nature  of  the\ntransaction with all counterpart and condition segmentation done at the loan subsystem level\nand with reporting on the portfolio coming from the subsystem, not the general ledger level.\n79. Six pilot banks have reached an agreement with BOM to develop and implement a MIS\nsoftware for these banks on a cost-sharing basis. The adoption of this software is expected to\nbe fully functional at TDB by the end of 2000, and will be installed in the remaining pilot banks in\n2001.  The  MIS  software  is  expected  to  strengthen  the  bank\u2019s  commercial  orientation  by", "23\nimproving banking operations, as well as strengthening reporting requirements to enhance\nbanking supervision by BOM.\nd. Develop an Interbank Market\n80. There is no functioning interbank market in Mongolia.  As financial markets develop, they\ngain breadth, as a wider range of instruments is available, and depth as the market volume\nincreases, thereby increasing liquidity of the markets. The development of the interbank market\nis a necessary step in the evolution of a well-balanced financial sector. The monetary authorities\nhave a role in promoting interbank market. An interbank market would provide banks with\nopportunities to invest funds, improve asset liability management, and reduce costs of funding\nthereby improving the profitability of banks.\n81. The development of a more fluid interbank market, including the formation of a variable\ninterbank rate, would provide a market signal on premiums associated with high risks. This\nwould serve to enhance market discipline in the banking system. Under the FSP II,  BOM in\nassociation with MOF will prepare a  plan focusing  on the prerequisites for  developing an\ninterbank market. The plan will include the formulation of a legal, regulatory, and institutional\nframework  to develop an interbank market.\n2. Strengthen Prudential Regulations and Supervision of NBFIs\n82. In view of the limited outreach of the banking system, finance companies are expected\nto assume a greater role in financial intermediation in Mongolia (para. 28). Over the past years,\nBOM  has  licensed  four  non-deposit-taking  finance  companies  and  21  credit  cooperatives.\nAppropriate  mechanisms  need  to  be  introduced,  including  regulations  on  licensing\nrequirements, risk-based prudential standards, minimum paid-in capital to ensure a healthy\nnonbank  financial  system,  and  accounting  standards  for  the  NBFIs.  The  Supervision\nDepartment of BOM must also be properly organized to ensure effective supervision of NBFIs.\nUnder the FSP II, BOM will (i) strengthen NBFI regulations requiring finance companies to\ncomply  with  risk-based  prudential  regulations;  (ii) issue  accounting  standards  for  NBFIs;\n(iii) restructure the Supervision Department of BOM to monitor and enforce NBFIs regulations;\nand (iv) enact amendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other legislation to vest BOM\nwith oversight responsibility over savings and credit cooperatives through second- and higher-\ntier credit associations.\n3. Develop Capital Market Infrastructure\na. Separate and Privatize the MSE, CDS, and SCS\n83. The  MSE  is state-owned and  operates  as  a  self-regulatory  organization  under  the\ngeneral oversight of MSEC. In addition, the CDS and SCS are part of the MSE with common\nstaff. This affects the governance structure of securities markets, results in diffuse lines of\nresponsibility, and limits the possibility of checks and balances within the system. In addition, it\ncan result in a potential conflict of interest of senior staff and management. To address these\nconcerns, the FSP II will focus on assessing the feasibility and preparing a plan, acceptable to\nADB, to separate the MSE as a legal entity, and the CDS and SCS as one or two separate legal\nentities, with the objective of facilitating their eventual privatization. Privatization of the MSE,\nCDS, and SCS is a condition for program completion.", "24\nb. Strengthen Operational and Regulatory Capacity at MSEC\n84. MSEC  needs a  major  overhaul,  and  more  and  technically  stronger  staff  if  it  is  to\neffectively carry out its supervisory and regulatory functions. The failing confidence in the equity\nmarkets partly reflects the institutional and resource constraints at MSEC. The FSP II will\nsupport the strengthening of MSEC through the TA (paras. 110-113) to develop operational,\nmanagement, administrative, and other relevant institutional strengthening measures.\n85. Similarly, the FSP II will foster improved governance in the equity markets. This will\nprimarily involve improving regulations to ensure that all trades are undertaken at MSE through\naccredited traders and as such reduce the scope for illicit trading. In addition, under FSP II and\nto  strengthen  the  association  of  brokers,  dealers,  and  subbrokers,  minimum  capital\nrequirements  of  security  firms  will  be  doubled  from  Tug10  to  Tug20  million.  This  will  be\ncomplemented by measures to strengthen accountability and transparency through regulations\non insider trading and development of a code of ethics and guidelines for MSEC and MSE\nemployees.\nc.  Strengthen the Securities Law\n86. For  the  securities  market  to  function  effectively  and  to  complement  the  eventual\nprivatization of the MSE, the Securities Law must be strengthened. FSP II will support efforts to\nstrengthen: (i) MSEC\u2019s capacity as the regulatory body in charge of the securities markets;\n(ii) transparency of securities trading and disclosure requirements, and enforcement provisions;\nand  (iii)  improvement  of  corporate  governance,  in  particular  strengthening  minority\nshareholders\u2019 rights, and having stricter auditing requirements for companies to be listed and\nbroader  representation  among  MSEC  members.  To  improve  confidence  in  the  MSE,\nenforcement of listing requirements will be strengthened and greater penalties will be applied for\nbreach of rules.\nd. Prepare Law on Trusts and a Law on Investment Funds\n87. The legal framework for the development of the securities market needs strengthening.\nTo create a proper environment for the development of the securities market and thereby\nenhance  domestic  resource  mobilization  including  through  the  participation  of  institutional\ninvestors, the FSP II will support the preparation of a law on trusts and a law on investment\nfunds. The preparation and subsequent approval of these two important laws are expected to\nstrengthen demand in the equity markets and improve domestic, and in the longer run, external\nresource mobilization as mutual funds and other investment funds develop.\n4.  Strengthen the Pension System\na. Develop a Partially Funded System\n88. While the new system will enable pension payments to be closely linked to contributions,\nthe pension fund will be unfunded for the near future. The Government intends to introduce\npartial funding gradually from 2005. However, this is not mandated in the law and no sound\nactuarial analysis has been undertaken to make an informed decision about the timing. Further,\nthere is no legal and regulatory framework to govern the introduction of partial funding or on\ninvestments of the accumulated pensions in securities. There are concerns that the introduction\nof partial funding may be delayed or may not be successful unless the Government\u2019s efforts are\nsupported in the legal and regulatory areas. The FSP II aims to support the Government\u2019s\nefforts in formulating an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for partial funding. TA", "25\nsupport (paras. 110-113) will also be provided to undertake new actuarial projections to guide\nthe timing of phasing-in of the partial funding.\nb. Improve the Administrative Processes in SSIGO\n89. To facilitate the introduction of partial funding of the pension system, the administrative\ncapacity of SSIGO needs considerable strengthening. In particular, SSIGO must develop a plan\nspecifying the administrative and regulatory aspects involved in managing a partially funded\nsystem. Ad hoc changes to pensions, in the absence of an indexation mechanism, such as the\nrecent  Government  announcement  to  increase  pensions  in  order  to  equalize  the  benefits\nbetween the pre- and post-1995 retirees, result in administrative complexities in the process of\nbenefit calculations. Under the FSP II, the Government will undertake several measures to\nstrengthen its administrative capacity  and  processes  to facilitate the  change  to  a  notional\ndefined contributory system, and to improve pension collections. As part of the FSP II, TA\nsupport will also be provided for the introduction of pension indexation.\n90. SSIGO has thus far only been a collection agency, without any role in long-term financial\nmanagement  or  investments.  As  the  Government  moves  toward  partial  funding,  proper\ninvestment guidelines and regulations need to be drafted. As part of the legal and regulatory\nframework supported under the FSP II, the financial management and investment capacity in\nthe pension system will be enhanced.\nc. Develop Non-State Voluntary Pensions\n91. To  minimize  the  burden  on  the  pay-as-you-go  system,  as  well  as  to  provide  for\nsupplementary budgets to the elderly, the Government plans to introduce non-state voluntary\npensions to supplement the current \u201cfirst pillar\u201d pension provisions. There is currently no legal\nand regulatory framework governing supplementary non-state pensions. Such a law is critical to\nsupport the eventual development of voluntary retirement savings options. Under the FSP II, the\nGovernment will prepare draft legislation to facilitate the development of a voluntary private\npension system.\n5. Strengthen the Insurance System\n92. While Mongolia has a long history with insurance products, there is a lack of operational\nand regulatory capacity in the industry. Besides considerable regulatory support, policy and\noperational  assistance  is  needed  to  strengthen  the  system.  There  are  no  prudential\nrequirements  governing  solvency  in  the  industry  at  present,  barring  minimum  capital\nrequirements of Tug100 million ($95,000). Under the FSP II, the Government will submit draft\namendments  to  the  Law  on  Insurance  to  Parliament  for  approval.  The  amendments  will\n(i) introduce  risk-based  solvency  requirements  in the  industry,  (ii)  strengthen  the  minimum\ncapital requirements, and (iii) increase the percentage of premium incomes that can be invested\nby the insurance companies. Support will also be provided to the ISU to develop and adopt a\nsound regulatory framework with adequate guidelines and standards, reporting and disclosure\nrequirements, accounting,  auditing  and  prudential  norms,  investment  guidelines,  and  other\nconditions in accordance with international best practices.\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues\n93.  The FSP II is expected to have an impact on facilitating resource mobilization through\nthe private banking system, capital markets, and the public finance sector. It will increase the\nefficiency  of  resource  allocation,  thereby  increasing  economic  activity  and  benefiting  all", "26\nelements of society including the poor and near poor. Appendix 4 presents the Poverty Impact\nAssessment for the FSP II. Through the banking system and capital markets, the FSP II is also\nexpected to have a beneficial effect on growth and employment by reducing intermediation\ncosts, and in time, reducing the cost of capital for businesses. It will also encourage direct\nprivate participation in economic activity.\n94. The development of an interbank market will facilitate the use of monetary instruments\nand improve liquidity management of banks. The capital markets component of the FSP II will\nstrengthen the operations of the stock exchange, improve investor confidence, and promote\nmarket trading. In addition, through legal reform, the FSP II will facilitate development of an\ninvestor base, which currently is nonexistent. Under the FSP II, development of the contractual\nsavings institutions will foster mechanisms to ensure a timely transition to a partially funded\nsystem, reducing unfunded liabilities and fiscal pressures in the medium term. The improved\nperformance of the pension and insurance system will enhance savings and the availability of\nproductive resources to enhance investments.\n95.  The FSP II is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.\nIts environmental impact is expected to be minimal.\nV I.  THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA. Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n96. It is proposed that the ADB provide a loan of SDR11,448,000 ($15 million equivalent)\nfrom its Special Fund resources for the FSP II. The loan amount for the FSP II was determined\non the basis of the strategic significance of the financial sector and the costs of structural\nreforms under the FSRP. The latter are estimated at $100 million equivalent,23 and will consist\nof the following components:\n(i) bank  restructuring,  including  liquidation,  restructuring,  recapitalization,  and\nsettlement of severance payments ($51 million equivalent);\n(ii) transition to a partially funded pension system ($28 million equivalent);\n(iii) institutional  strengthening  of  BOM,  Mongolian  Asset  Restructuring  Agency,\nMSEC, SSIGO, and ISU ($13 million equivalent); and\n(iv) others  including  privatization  of  MSE,  MIS  development,  and  liberalizing\nguidelines for pension and insurance funds ($8 million equivalent).\nB. Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n97. The Borrower will be Mongolia, and the loan will have a 24-year maturity, including an 8-\nyear grace period. The loan will carry an annual interest charge of 1 percent during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent during the amortization period.\n98. The  loan  will  be  utilized  within  36  months  commencing  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness. The loan proceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within 180\ndays prior to the date of effectiveness.\n                                               \n23\n  ADB\u2019s $15 million loan will cover the costs of adjustment under the FSRP, which is estimated at $100 million.\nThe IDA loan is $32 million equivalent (for three years) to support a balance of payments financing gap of $30\nmillion over the next two years.  The financing gap for the third year could be an additional $15 million (these\nfigures do not reflect the increase in the financing requirements resulting from the Zud).", "27\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing Agency\n99. BOM will be the Executing Agency for the FSP II, and will have overall responsibility for\nthe  program  implementation,  including  the  administration  and  disbursement  of  the  loan\nproceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of quarterly progress reports on program\nimplementation. These reports will include, progress made, problems encountered, remedial\nactions  taken  during  the  previous  quarter,  and  proposed  program  activities  and  expected\nprogress during the next quarter.\n2. Steering Committee\n100. A steering committee has been established to oversee implementation of the FSP II. The\ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOM  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives  from  MOF,  MSEC,  MSE,  SSIGO,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  State  Property\nCommittee. The steering committee will meet at least once every three months to ensure that\nthe proposed reforms are undertaken in accordance with the agreed timetable, all as set forth in\nthe list of actions to be taken during the FSP II. An adequately staffed program implementing\nunit has also been established within BOM to oversee day-to-day program implementation.\nD. Procurement\n101. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for\nprogram  loans,24  procurement of goods  and  services  produced  in  and  originating  in  ADB\nmember countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency in accordance\nwith standard public  sector  procedures  in  Mongolia  and normal  private  sector  commercial\npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  the case  of goods  commonly  traded on the  international\ncommodity markets, procurement will be undertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate\nto the trade and acceptable to ADB.\nE. Disbursement\n102. The proceeds of the FSP II loan will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to\na negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 5). Disbursement of loan proceeds will be permitted\non the basis of a certification provided by the Borrower confirming that in each year in which\nproceeds of the FSP II are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports\nfrom nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other official\ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during\nthe year.\nF. Counterpart Funds\n103. The policy framework for the FSP II includes specific components that bear distinct costs\nof structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be\nused to finance the structural adjustment costs under the FSP II. Any counterpart funds not\nrequired will be used first to finance the local currency costs of other projects financed by ADB,\nand second for general development purposes.\n                                               \n24  R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.", "28\nG. Monitoring and Tranching\n104. The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche will be $5 million equivalent,\nand the second tranche will be $10 million equivalent. The Government has complied with a\nnumber of up-front policy actions and the first tranche can be released as soon as the Loan\nAgreement becomes effective. These actions include (i) understandings on the financial sector\nstrategy;  (ii)  issuance  of  risk-based  prudential  regulations  to  govern  licensing  of  finance\ncompanies, and guidelines for the calculation of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios and foreign\nexchange exposure for finance companies; (iii) restructuring and strengthening the Supervision\nDepartment  of  BOM  to  monitor  and  enforce  prudential  regulations  for  banks,  finance\ncompanies, and financial leasing companies; and (iv) submission, to Parliament for approval,\ndraft amendments to the Securities Law to enhance transparency for all trades in the securities\nmarket. ADB has been heavily involved in the policy dialogue supporting these actions. Since\nFSP II is a part of the FSRP, the timely meeting of ADB\u2019s up-front policy actions and IDA\u2019s first\ntranche release conditions is a strong signal of the Government\u2019s commitment to carry forward\nthe reform program of FSP II. The second tranche is expected to be released by December\n2001, but this will be dependent upon satisfactory implementation of the FSP II, in particular, the\nfulfillment of all conditions for release of the second tranche set forth in the policy matrix. The\nrelease of the second tranche has been synchronized with the release of the second tranche of\nFSAC, which is also a two-tranched loan.\n105. For release of the second tranche, the following 13 actions will have to be satisfied:\n(i)  BOM will prepare and issue guidelines on best practices in corporate governance\nin  banking  institutions,  including  measures  to  strengthen  internal  control\nmechanisms, based on international practices such as the guidelines issued by\nBIS.\n(ii)  MOF and BOM will prepare a plan acceptable to ADB for development of an\ninterbank  market,  including  establishment  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and\ninstitutional framework.\n(iii)  The Government will prepare a plan acceptable to ADB on the expansion of\ntypes of property that can be used as loan collateral.\n(iv)  Progress acceptable to ADB will be achieved in implementing the program to\nintroduce and operationalize integrated banking MIS software in the Mongolian\nbanks participating in such program.\n(v)  Amendments to the Law on Cooperatives and any other necessary legislation will\nbe  enacted  to  provide  for  the  regulation  of  second-  and  higher-tier  credit\nassociations by BOM.\n(vi)  MSE and MSEC will increase the minimum capital requirements for securities\nbrokers and dealers to at least Tug20 million.\n(vii)  The  Government  will  submit  a  draft  law  on  trusts  acceptable  to  ADB  to\nParliament for approval.\n(viii)  The Government will submit a draft law on investment funds acceptable to ADB\nto Parliament for approval.", "29\n(ix)  The Government will prepare a plan acceptable to ADB to establish the MSE as\na separate legal entity, and the CDS and SCS as a separate legal entity or\nentities with each entity having separate financial and accounting records and no\nMSE officials on its staff, for their eventual privatization.\n(x)  MSEC  in  collaboration  with  the  MSE  will  develop  a  marketing  and  public\nawareness campaign to increase public knowledge of equity markets.\n(xi)  The Government will submit to Parliament, for approval, a draft amended and\nrestated Securities Law acceptable to ADB, with provisions to improve financial\ngovernance  (including  protection  of  minority  shareholder  rights,  increased\npenalties  for  Securities  Law  violations,  stricter  auditing  requirements  for\ncompanies to be listed, and broader representation of MSEC members) in line\nwith international best practices.\n(xii)  SSIGO will prepare a plan, acceptable to ADB, for introducing partial funding of\nthe pension system.\n(xiii)  MOF will draft and submit to Parliament, for approval, draft amendments to the\nLaw  on  Insurance  to  (i)  introduce  risk-based  solvency  requirements  in  the\nindustry, (ii) strengthen the minimum capital requirements, and (iii) increase the\npercentage  of  premium  incomes  that  can  be  invested  by  the  insurance\ncompanies in the securities market.\n106. The Government must comply with an additional 21 monitorable actions during the FSP\nII period. Government assurances have been sought in the Loan Agreement for fulfillment of\nthese policy actions. (A list of these monitorable actions are presented in Appendix 2).\n107. ADB will, in cooperation with BOM, carry out semiannual reviews of progress in program\nimplementation, and will assess its impact on the financial and other sectors of the economy.\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with the World\nBank Group and other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies that have implications for\nprogram implementation, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting\npolicy proposals.\n108. In addition to the semiannual progress reports, BOM will submit a program completion\nreport to ADB within three months of the end of the program period. This report will evaluate the\nimplementation of the policy reform measures under the FSP II, their impact on the economy\nand the financial sector, lessons learned during the program period, and further reforms and\nassistance needed for the sector development.\nH. Coordination with IDA\n109. Because the FSP II and IDA's FSAC support components under the Government's\noverall FSRP, coordination between ADB and IDA in implementing the FSP II and FSAC will be\ncritical to the success of the FSRP.  In this regard, ADB and IDA are finalizing a memorandum\nof understanding,  that  details  the  coordination  arrangements  between  the  two  institutions.\nAmong other things, ADB and IDA will be required to promptly inform the other of any event that\nmay interfere with, or hinder or impair the implementation of the FSRP, or that may interfere\nwith Mongolia\u2019s performance of its obligations under its loan agreement with ADB or IDA. Joint\nsupervision missions will be undertaken, in particular, prior to release of the FSP II and FSAC\nsecond tranches. While release of the second tranches of the FSP II and FSAC have been", "30\nsynchronized to take place in December 2001, there are no common conditions between ADB\nand IDA for release of the first or second tranches of the FSP II and FSAC; tranche release will\nbe at the sole discretion of the relevant lender under its respective loan agreement. There is no\ncross-default provision in the ADB or IDA loan agreement.\nVI I.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n110. The proposed TA, Strengthening Financial Sector Development, is an integral part of the\nFSP II as it will assist the Government in developing a more competitive, stable, and broad-\nbased financial system by increasing the efficiency of financial intermediation and supporting\nthe development of financial infrastructure. The TA will strengthen (i) the supervisory framework\nfor  NBFIs  (2  person-months);  (ii)  the  framework  for  secured  collateral  (2  person-month);\n(iii) legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for developing the capital markets (8 person-\nmonths); and (iv) the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for developing contractual\nsavings institutions (6 person-months). Appendix 6 presents the detailed terms of reference.\n111.  An international consulting firm with relevant experience in banking and capital market\ndevelopment in association with domestic consultants will be engaged to provide the services\nrequired. The TA will involve  18  person-months  of  international  consulting and  10 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting. The consultants will be recruited by ADB using the simplified\ntechnical proposal format in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n112. The TA is estimated to cost $730,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost of\n$580,000 and local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to\nfinance $600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $20,000 equivalent\nof the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded  TA  Program.  The  Government  will  provide  $130,000  equivalent  through  in  kind\ncontributions of counterpart staff, office facilities, and logistical support. Appendix 7 presents the\ncost estimates and financing plan for the TA.\n113.  The TA will be executed by BOM. BOM will form a coordinating committee, which will\nhave representatives from MOF, MSEC, MSE, and SSIGO. The TA is expected to start in\nSeptember 2000 and be completed by March 2001.\nVI II.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Benefits\n114. Mongolia\u2019s impaired financial system is potentially the most significant constraint  to\nstable  economic  growth  and  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development\nobjectives, particularly, poverty reduction. The beneficial impacts on poverty associated with the\nFSP II can be summarized as follows:\n(i) Strengthening the prudential and supervisory framework for SCCs and finance\ncompanies is expected to strengthen the development of sound and viable SCCs\nand improve access to credit by the more vulnerable and poorer segments of the\npopulation.\n(ii) Strengthening the banking system will render banks more resilient and will avoid\ndisruptions to the banking system from external shocks, which undermine growth\nprospects, wipe out savings, and lead to significant fiscal restructuring costs.", "31\n(iii) A consolidated, restructured, and well-regulated banking system will (a) on the\nexpenditure side, free-up public sector resources to invest in productive activities\nsuch as infrastructure or social sectors (i.e., health and education), which may\notherwise have been reallocated to bank restructuring or recapitalization; and (b)\non the revenue side, relax credit constraints and strengthen credit to the private\nsector, expanding GDP growth and with it, the taxable revenue base to meet\nsocial safety net and other social expenditure needs to minimize vulnerability of\nthe poor segment of the population.\n115. The financial sector reforms under the FSP II are necessary to ensure a stable, viable,\nand competitive financial system based on improved asset quality in the banking system, and a\nmore  efficient  banking  intermediation  process\u2014all  key  elements  in  restoring  credit  in  the\ndomestic economy. Development of the capital markets and  long-term  contractual  savings\ninstitutions will entail the creation of an enabling environment necessary to ensure domestic\nresource  mobilization  including  long-term  sources  of  investment  funds  to  complement  the\nlending channels intermediated through the banking system. The reforms subscribed under FSP\nII are expected to have a positive impact on savings and investment in the economy.\n116. The adjustment costs resulting from the liquidation of BITI and RB, as well as the\ndownsizing of AB, will have some short- to medium-term adverse effects reflecting loss of\nemployment (initially estimated at 1,000 staff). However, on the one hand, as employees in the\nbanking system are younger and generally better trained, they are more flexible and better\nsuited to find new employment opportunities. On the other hand, the Program is expected to\nlead to the growth of the NBF sector and newly established finance companies and other NBFIs\nwhich will likely absorb retrenched staff from closed down banks. Accordingly, the net impact on\npoverty is likely to be small.\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n117. The principal risk lies in the timing of the proposed FSP II. The FSP II loan will be\npresented for Board consideration just prior to a Parliamentary election. It is expected that the\nFSP II will be ratified by the current Parliament (within July). However, if this Parliament does\nnot ratify the FSP II, then the new Parliament may need additional lead time before final\nratification. This concern is considered manageable in view of the nature of the policy actions\nproposed under the FSP II, which have support from the various political groups.\n118. A second risk is that, typical of policy reform programs, the Government may be unable\nto implement the required policy measures because of resistance or lack of cooperation by\ninvolved parties such as the Parliament with respect to legal amendments, privatization of MSE\nand other policy actions. In addition, there may be risks associated with weak capacity at the\nagency level, the ability to recruit and retain qualified cadres especially at MSEC, and poor\ncoordination between financial sector institutions.\n119. To the extent that most of the reform measures are standard actions needed to foster an\nenabling  environment  for  financial  sector  development,  there  should  be  limited  risks  of\nunsatisfactory compliance with the policy actions. To reduce the downside risks from weak\ncapacity, TA is being provided to key agencies\u2014BOM, MOF, MSEC, SSIGO\u2014for institutional\nupgrading.  Policy  coordination  will  be  assisted  by  the  formation  of  a  high-level  steering\ncommittee and a program implementation unit.", "32\nIX .  ASSURANCES\n120. In addition to the standard assurances, the second tranche conditions set forth in the\npolicy matrix, and the other actions under the FSP II, the Government has assured ADB that\n(i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as described\nin the development policy letter, will continue in effect for the duration of the FSP II period; and\n(ii) the Government will adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the FSP II\nas specified in the development policy letter and/or the Loan Agreement, and ensure that such\npolicies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the program period.\nX .  RECOMMENDATION\n121. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 11,448,000 to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program, with\na term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of\n1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n1 June 2000", "Appendix 1, page 1\nUlaanbatar, May 10, 2000\nMONGOLIA\nLetter of Development Policy\nLong-Term Vision, Medium-Term Strategy and Policies for the Financial Sector Reform Program\nMr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n0401 Metro Manila\nPhilippines\nDear Mr. Chino:\nSubject: Proposed the Financial Sector Reform Program\n1. The Government is pleased to request the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International\nDevelopment Association (IDA) to jointly finance the financial sector reform program for Mongolia. We are\nhappy that both institutions are coordinating their efforts to support the program. This is an excellent example of\ndonor coordination and partnership. The comprehensive approach  to  developing  the  financial  sector  that\nencompasses both banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, involving other donors such as USAID, JICA,\nGTZ, is an extremely positive development for Mongolia. The fact that we are writing a joint letter attached with\na joint policy matrix to the presidents of the two international financial institutions bears testimony that we\nwelcome close donor coordination in the financial sector. We have sent the same letter to President Wolfensohn\nof the IDA.\nBackground\n2. A decade ago this past December 10, 1999, Mongolia embarked on a radical and comprehensive\nreform path\u2014indeed, the path we choose entailed nothing less than abrupt systemic change encompassing all\nspheres of the nation\u2019s political, economic and social life. If one compares our situation today with that at the\nend of 1989, one finds that while Mongolia still faces many daunting challenges, we have made great strides in\nreshaping our lives and our destiny for the better.\n3. Today, all citizens of Mongolia have the right and the opportunity to set their own goals, and to choose\nfreely how best to accomplish these goals. Freedom of choice is perhaps the most priceless achievement of this\nremarkable decade in Mongolian history.\n4. In 1990, Mongolia held its first free elections. These were an embodiment of the notion of pluralism and\nresulted in the formation of a new Cabinet from three different political parties, through which the basis for the\nensuing  comprehensive  reforms  of  Mongolian  society  was  established.  Subsequently,  under  the  1992\nConstitution, Mongolia has held two free and democratic parliamentary elections, as well as two presidential\nelections. New political parties have emerged, and the oldest one has evolved into a new democratic force.\n5. The transformation of the economy has been equally dramatic. The reforms launched by the first\ndemocratic  government in  1990-1992,  including  price liberalization,  establishment  of  a  new  banking  and\nfinancial system, and privatization, laid the foundation for the development of a private, market economy in\nMongolia. The sweeping transformation of the economy which has taken place in this decade was a direct\noutcome of those first reforms.\n6. The majority of the Mongolian people have come to comprehend in a relatively short period of time the\nnecessity of relying on their own visions, abilities and drive to meet the challenges of the new era. At the same\ntime, this decade has seen the emergence of new social problems such as unemployment and poverty. These\nwere the inevitable result of the withdrawal of the large external subsidies which had previously financed the\noperations of the entire Mongolian economy and social services to the tune of more than 30% of our GDP, and\nof the collapse of COMECON trading block. No country could endure or has endured such a dramatic shock\nwithout experiencing a period of hardship. It is precisely for this reason that Mongolia has embarked on a path of\ndrastic institutional and structural reforms in all spheres of the economy, and intends to continue on this path in", "Appendix 1, page 2\nthe future. Our national program of institutional, structural and policy reform is aimed at reducing the hardships\nof the transitional period, overcoming this period in the shortest time possible, and creating a solid foundation for\nthe future development of an efficient economy and the progressive advancement of our society.\n7. Substantial  progress  already  has  been  achieved  on  the  economic  front.  Mongolia  has  had  five\nconsecutive years of economic growth, and the economy expanded again, by 3.3%, in 1999 despite a further\npronounced deterioration in our terms of trade. Inflation has been brought down to single digits. The livestock\nsector, the backbone of the Mongolian economy, has been privatized, and dynamic private companies also are\noperating in many other key sectors of the economy. A thriving small business sector is generating jobs and\nincomes  for  large  numbers  of  our  people.  The  November  1999  employment  report  shows  that  open\nunemployment has dropped below 6% of the labor force. This is suggestive of the underlying dynamism of our\neconomy\u2014an economy whose structure is on the way to being rebuilt, in the course of a decade.\n8. At the same time, many serious challenges remain to be overcome. The external environment has\nturned extremely unfavorable, leading to excessive trade and budget imbalances and a sharp deterioration in\nthe banking system which must and are being addressed through painful adjustment measures. The need for\npolicies which will achieve more rapid economic growth and  improvement in the  living  standards  of the\nMongolian people in the face of such a difficult environment is urgent, and that is we why have acted to take the\nmeasures needed to both minimize the costs of our adjustment to the huge external shock, and to lay the\nfoundation for more rapid economic growth in the future. And we have done this despite an unfortunate cycle of\npolitical turmoil during 1998 and 1999. The banking sector is still very weak and unable to play its proper role in\npromoting economic growth. Some important sectors of the economy are still predominantly state-owned, and\nothers, although privatized, are still not competitive and generating growth. The Government itself, which must\nlead the national process of transition to a more productive and efficient society and economy, has undergone\nrelatively less structural change. Mongolia has barely begun to address the question of how to deliver necessary\nsocial services to its population without the large external subsidies which had previously financed them.\n9. We are very fortunate in that we have many generous and reliable development partners, and as\ndiscussed at the Seventh Mongolia Assistance chaired by the World Bank in June 1999, Mongolia needs a\ntransitory increase in donor aid to enable us to carry out the needed measures to adjust to the huge external\nshock\u2014a shock totaling an estimated 17% of GDP during 1998-99\u2014in a phased manner so as to avoid undue\nwelfare losses. To this end, and to support a series of reforms aimed at creating a sound and efficient financial\nsystem needed for faster economic growth, we are requesting a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit from the\nIDA (the Association), in the amount of US$32 million equivalent, and a Financial Sector Reform Program Loan\nfrom the ADB in the amount of US$15 million equivalent to support the projected 2000 to mid-2003 balance of\npayments financing gap.\nMacroeconomic Framework\n10. Terms of Trade Shocks. The sharp falls in 1998-99 in world prices for copper, gold and cashmere,\nMongolia\u2019s leading exports, have caused great harm to the Mongolian economy. In 1998, export earnings\nplunged US$150 million (or by amount equal to about 15% of GDP), due entirely to these price declines. This\nled to a cumulative depreciation of the exchange rate of 35%, and to a drop in official reserves. The sharp\ncontraction in the value of exports due to the fall in commodity prices reduced Government revenues by almost\n4% of GDP in both 1998 and 1999, relative to the level of 1997. Corporate taxes from the copper sector\ndeclined from 3% of GDP to nil in 1998, and in 1999.\n11. Due to the steep decline in world prices for copper, the Erdenet Copper Concern also has been unable\nto settle its bills with the Energy Authority, the Oil Importing Company, and electric power stations, making it\ndifficult for the latter to pay money owed to the coal mining companies and to the railways. All of these firms\nhave in turn been unable to pay their expected taxes and dividends to the state budget. This created a\ncascading of arrears in the economy, causing slowdowns in the activities of these major producers, and a large\nincrease in the Government\u2019s budget deficit\u2014from 8.6 to 11.7% of GDP from 1997 to 1998, and in the creation\nof domestic credit to finance the deficit (to 3% of GDP in 1998). As a result, in 1998, the Government fell into\narrears on payments of salaries and pensions. This external shock also contributed to a marked deterioration in\nfinancial sector performance, with non-performing loans rising to about 41% of total commercial bank loans.\n12. The Government has acted with determination to address the imbalances caused by the terms of trade\nshock. The Value Added Tax Law was adopted and became effective on July 1, 1998. In September 1998, the\nVAT was raised from 10 to 13%, a 10% tax of the export of gold was adopted, and the excise tax of imported", "Appendix 1, page 3\npetroleum and petroleum products was raised by US$7 a ton. In addition, the 1999 budget froze wages and\nsalaries, and reduced outlays on goods and services.\n13. Government\u2019s Fiscal Program. In May 1999, Government adopted a comprehensive, medium-term\nprogram to adjust to the impact of the terms of trade shock, including a package of measures to augment fiscal\nrevenue by a further 2% of GDP annually and reduce capital spending and net lending by about 1% of GDP,\nwith the support of the second year of the PRGF Arrangement, approved in June 1999, whose first review we\nsuccessfully completed in January 2000. These fiscal measures, coupled with the 1998 tax increases, cut the\noverall deficit of the general Government to 9.9% of GDP in 1999, from 11.7% in 1998. This adjustment,\ntogether with higher net external financing with the support of the PRGF, reduced the Government\u2019s use of net\nbanking system credit in 1999 to less than 1% of GDP, compared to 3% of GDP in 1998. The full-year effects of\nthese tax measures, together with public administration reform and further privatization, are projected to narrow\nthe General Government\u2019s overall deficit to 7.3% of GDP in 2000, and to 5.3% by 2002, with zero net domestic\ncredit to Government beginning in 2000. Inflation, which was brought down to 6% in 1998 (from 21% in 1997\nand 45% in 1996), rose to 10% by the end of 1999 due to the impact of lagged relative price adjustments to the\nexternal shock and excessive credit extended to the Government in 1998. It is projected to decelerate to 7% in\n2000. At the end of 1999, the total General Government debt reached an estimated 78% of GDP, with external\ndebt amounting to 71% of GDP. External debt service amounted to less than 6% of exports of goods and\nnonfactor services in 1999, due to the concessional nature of that debt and the high degree of openness of the\neconomy. During 2000-02, the Government\u2019s total debt to GDP ratio is projected to increase to 79%, and its\nexternal debt, to 73% of GDP. At the same time, economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4-5%.\n14. The Budget for 2000. The Government budget for 2000 seeks to consolidate fiscal sustainability and\nfree-up resources for the private sector. As mentioned above, the overall deficit is projected to decline to 7.3% in\n2000,  and  net  domestic financing, to  zero.  The  2000  budget  is  geared  to  reversing  the  recent  decline\nGovernment revenues relative to GDP, while reducing Government spending as a percentage of GDP and\nimproving the prioritization of public spending. Total revenue is slated to rise to 28.4% of GDP, reflecting a slight\nincrease in income taxes and dividends from the copper sector, and the full-year effects of the revenue\nmeasures introduced in 1999. Total spending is targeted to fall to 35.7% of GDP, compared to 36.3% in 1999\n(and 39% in 1998). The budget makes provisions for the full servicing of public debt, including Government\nbonds. Outlays on goods and services will be tightly controlled and domestically-financed capital expenditures\non lower priority projects will be reduced. The Government also will be undertaking a public expenditure review,\nwith the support of IDA, during 2000. During 2000, the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit would\nassist to achieve the above macroeconomic targets.\n15. Reducing the Size of the State. Steps will also be taken to focus Government on core functions,\noutsourcing other activities, and to increase its efficiency, in the context of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nsupported Governance Reform Program. Government also is taking action to improve the governance of state\nenterprises and curtail their involvement in activities that could be more efficiently carried out by the private\nsector. To improve pricing decisions, and allow state enterprises to operate on a commercial basis, these\nenterprises will be granted greater managerial autonomy. Regular financial audits of state enterprises will be\ninstituted. State enterprises will continue to face hard budget constraints (zero net domestic bank credit), and\nwill not receive Government transfers. In addition, the Government has expanded its privatization program,\nwhich yielded revenues of about 1.7% of GDP in 1998, to the largest state enterprises. The National Oil Import\nConcern and the Gobi Cashmere Company are to be privatized, as is the Trade and Development Bank (see\nalso paragraph 38 below).\n16. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy. The Bank of Mongolia has continued to pursue the flexible\nexchange rate policy adopted in 1993 and effectively implemented in the last quarter of 1998 to facilitate the\nadjustment to the external shock, and will continue to do so in the future. At the end of 1999 the exchange rate\nwas about 25% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 1998, leading to a depreciation of the Togrog of\nabout 4% in real effective terms. International reserves also have substantially recovered from their 1998\ndecline, and official holdings of external assets reached US$151, or the equivalent of about 14 weeks of\nimports, compared to less than 12 in 1998. The primary objective of monetary policy is to keep inflation in single\ndigits. With the deceleration of inflation during 1998 and for most of 1999, the yield on central bank bills was\nprogressively lowered, to 10% per annum. As the Government deficit is reduced, banking reforms advance and\ninflation decelerates during 2000, reductions in commercial bank lending interest rates should be feasible.\nGrowth in monetary aggregates would reflect increased credit to the private sector (with zero net lending to\nGovernment and state enterprises) and the further build-up of net external assets towards an adequate level.", "Appendix 1, page 4\n17. Accelerating Economic Growth and Improving Living Standards. Real GDP growth over the past\nfew years has grown at a modest pace of 3.5%. With an annual population rate of 2%, per capita GDP has also\nincreased. However, the significant deterioration in the terms of trade since the second-half of 1996 had have a\nmajor adverse impact on the purchasing power of exports, which account for about 40% of GDP, and, hence, on\nincome and living standards.\n18. Managing External Shocks. Managing external shocks has become imperative if Mongolia is going to\naccelerate economic growth and to be able to translate greater output into higher per capita incomes and\ndeclining poverty. Better management of external shocks will lead to higher living standards by reducing fiscal\nand monetary volatility, reducing uncertainty, enhancing financial sector performance, and mitigating drastic\nswings in producer and consumer incomes. To this end, under the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit\n(FSAC), the Government would adopt a time-bound action plan, satisfactory to the Association, to improve\nmanagement of external shocks. It is envisaged that this action plan will encompass measures to smooth-out\nfiscal revenues, and measures to manage commodity price risk to shield producer incomes from the full impact\nof commodity price fluctuations. On the latter, we hope that Mongolia will qualify as an early test case under the\nWorld Bank\u2019s Commodity Initiative.\nCurrent Situation of the Financial Sector\n 19. The financial sector in Mongolia is slowly evolving to a market-based system, but is still not able to\ncontribute to the development of the economy, and has instead been a drag on economic development.\nConsolidated banking sector indicators have improved in the past several months thanks to the implementation\nof measures taken in connection with the 1996 Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) funded by ADB and\ncontinued under the Banking Restructuring Action Plan of 1999 and the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment\nCredit to be funded by the Association. Currently the banking sector also meets the international criteria for\ncapital  adequacy  (10%)  and  liquidity  (18%).  The  financial  sector,  however,  remains  weak  and  financial\nintermediation continues to be severely constrained. Building on ADB\u2019s assistance under the FSPL in support of\nbank restructuring, further restructuring is needed to support the development of viable core private banks.\n 20. At end-1999, total bank assets amounted to only 18 percent of GDP, while total credit outstanding to the\nprivate sector was only about 5 percent of GDP. Four large banks out of 12 currently licensed banks hold 80\npercent of total assets of the banking system. The Savings Bank, one of the largest banks, does not perform\nany financial intermediation functions. The remaining 8 banks have only negligible market shares, have little\ncapacity to compete with the largest 4 banks, and conduct limited financial intermediation activities. The state\ndirectly and indirectly owns shares of 6 banks. These include controlling shareholding of 3 banks (Trade and\nDevelopment Bank, Savings Bank and Agriculture Bank), which together account for 70 percent of total assets\nof the banking system.\n 21. Non-bank financial institutions are at an incipient stage of development. The stock market is small and\nilliquid; and market-based insurance and leasing businesses are only beginning to emerge. Nevertheless,\nconsiderable potential exists for development of non-bank financial institutions as a competing force, provided a\nsuitable legal environment is created. Currently, long-term credit exists only in the following two forms: through\nproject financing from some commercial banks that serve as on-lenders of credit extended to the Government\nby donors, or through establishing relationships with foreign banks and markets.\n22. The financial sector has recently witnessed the expansion of credit cooperatives and micro finance\ncompanies. These institutions are expected to play a greater role as effective providers of small credit. Finance\ncompanies and financial leasing companies are also beginning to emerge. In line with development of these\nnon-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the Government is committed to providing a suitable legal environment\nincluding improving supervisory and regulatory oversight of these institutions by BOM .\n \n 23. During the last 10 years the Government of Mongolia has taken an important series of actions aimed at\nestablishing a market-based banking system, its restructuring and development. Mongolia replaced the one-tier\nbanking system by a two-tier one; put in place the foundations of the legal framework for banking operations;\nlicensed private banks; and liberalized interest rates and capital flows, with  the  assistance  of  the  donor\ncommunity.  Since  1996,  a  series  of  actions  have  been  taken  to  further  modernize  banking  legislation,\nstrengthen prudential norms and bank supervision, and to restructure the banking sector.", "Appendix 1, page 5\n 24. Although policies on banking sector reforms, restructuring and liberalization of financial transactions\nhave been broadly moving in the right direction, the banking sector has faced several crises on its transition\npath (1994, 1996, 1998-1999).\n 25. Despite these efforts, the banking sector remains small, weak and crisis-prone. It is still necessary to\nconsiderably improve banking staff skills and capacity, as well as the legal and operational environment for\nconducting banking activities.\n 26. Real lending interest rates are extremely high. Despite the deceleration of inflation to single digits, and\nsubsequent reduction in Central Bank bill rates and deposit rates, lending interest rates remain high in both real\nand nominal terms. This has adversely impacted financial intermediation and the entire economy. The main\nreasons for high lending interest rates are: the high level of non-performing loans; expectations of currency\ndevaluation resulting from the terms of trade shock; little competition in the financial sector; weak institutional\ncapacity and failure of the Government to make timely payments on its financial obligations. High lending\ninterest rates in turn contribute to deterioration of loan quality.\n 27. In 1996, the Government issued bonds in an amount equivalent to 5 percent of GDP to protect deposits\nof customers of two insolvent banks, within the framework of the banking sector restructuring program. Of these\nbonds, 60 percent is owned by the Savings Bank, and 40 percent is owned by the  Central Bank. The\nGovernment has failed to make timely payments of interest on these bonds. Moreover, these bonds have not\nhad clearly defined terms and maturities. The fact that the Government has failed to meet its obligations on its\nbonds on a timely basis is contributing to deterioration of the financial position and efficient decision-making of\nbond-holders, and is sending an improper message to the general economy by exercising an unhealthy practice\nof not meeting contract obligations.\n 28. The rural payments system has had significant, recurring problems due to strained state and local\ngovernment budgets and lack of creditworthiness of the Agriculture Bank, virtually the only bank servicing rural\nareas.  This  bank  is  currently  operating  under  the  receivership  of  the  Central  Bank  and  is  undertaking\nrestructuring actions such as renewal of service fees on a contract basis, reduction of operational costs and loan\nrecovery efforts. Currently, operations of the bank are restricted to providing payments of pensions and benefits\nas well as salaries of government employees in rural areas. Micro-lending institutions in rural areas have been\nestablished only recently in three Aimags, and have not started operating at the soum level.\n 29. The  capital  markets  and  contractual  savings  institutions  in  Mongolia  are  at  a  nascent  stage  of\ndevelopment. The stock market is small and illiquid; and the pension and insurance systems have played a\nlimited role in terms of developing alternative sources of funds to finance economic growth. Despite the smaller\nsize of the capital markets in  relation  to the  banking  sector,  the Government recognizes  the increasing\nimportance of capital markets in developing the financial sector in Mongolia.\n 30. Market capitalization at the Mongolian Stock Exchange as of December 1999 was $32 million, or\n3 percent of GDP, down from $53 million at the end of 1997. Trading activity has declined sharply over the last\nyear, as evidenced by the drop in average daily trading from $50,000 in 1998 to about $10,000 in 1999.\n 31. The Government recognizes that the small corporate sector and slow progress with regard to the\nprivatization of the remaining 95 SOEs, the largest of which are likely to be sold to strategic investors outside of\nthe MSE, has constrained the supply of better quality stock. On the demand side, limited capacity of MSEC to\nserve  as  an  effective  policymaker  and  regulator  has  dampened  investor  confidence  and  necessitates\nconsiderable institutional strengthening.\n 32. The Government is aware that the 1997 Insolvency Law has seldom been applied in the resolution of\ncorporate bankruptcies. Under the IDA-assisted Beltac Project and the IDA IDF Grant for the Insolvency Law,\nthe Government is undertaking measures to strengthen the knowledge and application of the Insolvency Law by\ncreditors. These measures will help improve overall corporate governance and accelerate resolution of non-\nperforming loans in the banking sector and debt recovery. With respect to financial governance, Mongolia is\nunique  in that its  stock  exchange  is  owned  by  the  Government,  and  we  are  strongly  committed  to  its\nprivatization.\n 33. The capital markets would further benefit from the development of the pension system. The Mongolian\npension system is a pay-as-you-go system where current work force pay for the retired workers. Like other", "Appendix 1, page 6\ntransition economies, the pension system has been afflicted by (i) growing unfunded liabilities; (ii) contribution\narrears, particularly from state-owned bodies; and (iii) a narrow base of pension contributions relative to\nrecipients.\n 34. To address these issues, Government pension plan aims to introduce notionally defined individual\npension accounts. In this regard, the Law on Individual Pension Accounts was adopted by the Parliament on 11\nJune 1999, under which workers born after 1 January 1960 will be given individual pension accounts indicating\ntheir  past  pension  contributions  with  effect  from  1 January  2000.  The  annual  \u201creturns\u201d  to  the  individual\ncontributions will be determined by the Social Security Insurance General Office. While the new system will\nenable pension payments to be closely linked to contributions, the pension fund will be unfunded for the\nforeseeable future, although the Government has plans to invest a part of the contributions of the younger\nworkers in the domestic capital markets. The Government also plans to introduce non-state voluntary pensions\nin Mongolia, to supplement the current \u201cfirst pillar\u201d pension provisions.\n The Government will be preparing draft legislation to allow the development of a voluntary private pension\nsystem.\n 35. While Mongolia has a long history with insurance products, there is a lack of operational and regulatory\ncapacity in the industry. Besides considerable regulatory support, policy and operational assistance is needed to\nstrengthen the sector. Except for minimum capital requirements of Tug. 100 million ($95,000), there are no\nprudential requirements governing solvency in the industry at present. Investment guidelines for insurance\ncompanies need to be strengthened as capital markets gradually develop in the country.\n 36. Although the recent policy on financial sector restructuring and actions taken to implement this policy\nhave generally been moving in the right direction, it is necessary to take decisive actions to make fundamental\nchanges in the current weak situation, to restore public confidence, and to establish a strong financial sector\ncapable of supporting economic development.\n 37. With these objectives in mind, the Long-term Vision and the Medium-term Strategy necessary to\nimplement this long-term vision for the development of financial sector is formulated below, and Financial Sector\nReform Program Loan. The Government and the Bank of Mongolia and would be implemented with the support\nof the proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit consider that the general policy guidelines and specific\nactions to be taken to implement the medium-term strategy also should be reflected in the annual Monetary\nPolicy Guidelines that are approved by Parliament at the end of each year, ensuring ownership and consensus\non the financial sector reforms as we move forward.\n Key Lessons Learned from past efforts to Reform the Financial Sector\n 38. The following lessons from the experience of last 10 years of financial sector restructuring were taken\ninto  consideration  in  determining  the  long-term  vision  and  medium  term  strategy  for  financial  sector\ndevelopment:\n\u2022  It is necessary to build the infrastructure aimed at supporting a market-based financial system,\nwith strong financial discipline and prudential controls.\n\u2022  The financial  sector  will  not  develop  without  a  state  that  supports  contract  enforcement,\nprotection and securitization of private property.\n\u2022  Financial  sector  restructuring  will  not  be  successful  unless  the  sequence  of  reforms  is\ndetermined correctly and a stable political environment exists.\n\u2022  State intervention in allocation of financial resources hinders development of a market-based\nfinancial sector.\n\u2022  The fact that the state recapitalizes insolvent banks and takes their risks increases potential\nlosses in the future.\n\u2022  Lax entry requirements result in an excessive number of weak, poorly managed banks.\n\u2022  A  sound  financial  sector  cannot  be  created  without  an  appropriate  legal  framework  and\noperational structures aimed at strengthening the repayment culture.", "Appendix 1, page 7\n\u2022  Capital markets and NBFIs should be developed to complement the banking sector and foster a\nbalanced financial structure.\n\u2022  Investor confidence is crucially dependent on the existence of sound corporate governance\nsystems and practices in the financial sector.\n\u2022  The role of the Government in the ownership of financial institutions impairs their rapid growth as viable\nentities.\n Long-Term Vision for Financial Sector Development\n 39. Based on the above lessons and exchange of views with key stakeholders, including members of\nParliament from both sides of the aisle and donors active in the sector, the long-term vision for the financial\nsector in Mongolia for the next 10 years is envisaged as follows:\n\u2022  The role of the state will be directed to ensuring macroeconomic and financial sector stability, and\nthe state will intervene only in circumstances where market forces patently fail to work.\n\u2022  There is an effective, autonomous central bank and a legal framework which requires good\nprudential regulation, corporate governance, and supervision and prompt corrective action (i.e. the\nclosure of banks when the capital adequacy ratio declines below a certain minimum level);\n\u2022 A relatively few number of sound and efficient domestic and foreign banks would emerge and would\nbe capable of providing efficient banking services in a competitive environment.\n\u2022 Ownership of all commercial banks will have been transferred to the private sector.\n\u2022  Basic payment and banking services are available to meet demand outside Ulaanbaatar through a\nvariety of channels (e.g., micro-finance institutions, regional cooperatives, private banks).\n\u2022  The financial  sector  will  have  a  cadre  of  banking  and  related  personnel  trained  in  best\ninternational practices.\n\u2022  The legal environment for conducting financial activities as well as accounting standards will be\nrigorously enforced, with the aim of strengthening public confidence in the financial institutions.\n\u2022  There is a growing number of NBFIs (e.g., finance and leasing companies, contractual savings\ninstitutions, cooperatives, and micro-finance companies) to help meet the demand for savings and\ninvestment.\n\u2022  A healthy and well governed capital market will be developed to complement the banking\nsector.\n \n Medium-term Strategy for Financial Sector Development\n 40. The Government recognizes its Long-Term Vision will take many years to achieve. Consequently, it has\ndevised a Medium-Term strategy that will lay the foundations necessary for achieving this vision over the longer\nterm. The key elements of the medium term strategy for financial sector development are as follows:\n\u2022 establish the foundations for a market-based financial system, including the development of modern\nbanking skills, the enhancement of auditing and accounting standards, the enforcement of financial\ncontracts and the establishment of an exit policy process for troubled banks;\n\u2022 signal  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  uphold  rights  and  obligations  under  financial  contracts,\nbeginning with the timely servicing of interest payments on government bonds held by banks;\n\u2022 reduce the pervasive role of the state in the allocation of financial resources\u2014until the revocation of the\nlicenses in December 2000 of the deeply insolvent ITI and RB Bank, government controlled banks\naccounted for about 90% of the assets in the banking system;\n\u2022 facilitate the development of sustainable rural financial institutions to provide payment systems and\nbanking services appropriate to conditions existing in a sparsely populated country such as Mongolia;\n\u2022 prompt the consolidation of the banking system by doubling the minimum capital requirement to T2\nbillion (about US$1.9 million);", "Appendix 1, page 8\n\u2022 strengthen the legal framework for effective supervision and regulation by the central bank including the\nrequirement for prompt corrective action;\n\u2022 develop a resolution and liquidation framework for failed banks;\n\u2022 provide the foundations for the development of a market for government bonds and an inter-bank\nmarket;\n\u2022 strengthen  corporate  governance  in  the  financial  sector  by  encouraging  banks  to  move  towards\ninternational standards such as the guidelines on corporate governance in banking institutions issued\nby the Bank for International Settlements;\n\u2022 foster a healthy capital market  by  carrying  out  reforms in  MSE  and  MSEC to  enhance  investor\nconfidence; and\n\u2022 institute a regulatory mechanism to guide the development of the NBFI sector.\n41. The proposed Financial Sector Adjustment Credit and Financial Sector Reform Program would support\nthe  implementation  of the  Governments  Medium-Term  Strategy for the  Reform  and  Development  of  the\nFinancial System.\nBank Restructuring and Privatization\n42. A largely insolvent state-owned banking system impedes .faster economic growth and improvements in\nliving standards.  Heavy banking system losses inflate the public sector deficit and debt, diverting funds from\npoverty reduction, human resource development and infrastructure.\n43. ITI Bank and Reconstruction Bank. On December 24, 1999, the Bank of Mongolia revoked the\nlicenses, and initiated a resolution dictating the liquidation of,  ITI Bank and Reconstruction Bank.  With this\nunprecedented measure, the size of the state banking sector was reduced by about one-fifth.\n44. Agricultural Bank. AB is deeply insolvent and incurring operating losses averaging nearly T50 billion\nper month. At present, AB also operates the largest branch network in Mongolia and only one with a presence\ndown to the county (soum) level. The accumulated losses of AB amount to T7 billion (equivalent to about 0.7%\nof GDP on a yearly basis).The Government plans to recapitalize, restructure and eventually privatize AB, in\naccordance with a Restructuring Plan that would be supplemented in consultation with IDA, to strengthen its\nprovisions relating to corporate governance; commercial viability; the actions required to bring it to the point-of-\nsale; and the revocation of its license if a sound bank cannot be established. Over the medium-term, AB either\nwill have been brought to the point-of-sale (to owners who can provide appropriate governance and ensure\nfinancial viability), or, if AB has become insolvent again, BOM will have revoked its license. In the meantime, the\nGovernment will begin to implement alternative arrangements for ensuring payment services to the population\noutside the capital.\n45. Savings Bank. The Savings Bank was established as a special purpose vehicle to collect and protect\nhousehold deposits following the banking crisis of 1996. Savings Bank holds about one-third of the banking\nsystem\u2019s total deposits. The bank has more than 260,000 accounts with an average size of about US$12\nequivalent  each. The  bank functions  essentially  as  a  Government  agency  with  an  implicit  state  deposit\nguarantee and lacks a banking/lending culture. The Government\u2019s failure, until recently, to service the bank\nrestructuring bonds that make up virtually all of its assets resulted in a deficit cash flow and operating losses,\ncausing the Savings Bank to maintain higher deposit rates than otherwise would be needed, further pushing-up\neconomy-wide interest rates. Furthermore, Savings Bank\u2019s policy of investing all its assets in non-marketable\nGovernment  bonds  prevents  one-third  of  all  deposits  (representing  approximately  75%  of  all  household\ndeposits) from being intermediated.\n46. Savings Bank needs to be made financially viable to limit systemic risk, downsized to reduce state\nexposure and foster financial intermediation, and eventually, turned into a financial intermediary. Therefore,\nGovernment is clearing all interest arrears on its bonds, and will service those bonds in future at an interest rate\nlinked to the BOM bill rate. Clearance of interest arrears has enabled Savings Bank to begin lowering its interest\nrates. Over the medium-term, Government will replace the stock of bank restructuring bonds with marketable\nsecurities that will be regularly serviced. In the meantime, Savings Bank will be downsized, by, inter alia,\nbringing its interest rate structure in line with market rates, and increasing service fees to levels charged by", "Appendix 1, page 9\nother banks. Over the medium-term, the Government will prepare an action plan for the transformation of\nSavings Bank into a financial intermediary, including its privatization.\n47. Trade and Development Bank. The Trade and Development Bank (TDB) is Mongolia\u2019s largest bank;\nhowever, during 1998 and the first half of 1999, the bank incurred significant loan losses from weak governance\nand poor lending practices.\n48. Scarcity of modern banking skills is severely handicapping development of a banking system, and the\nfastest way to develop these skills is through the training that a reputable international bank could provide. In\naddition, much greater private ownership and market allocation of resources in the financial system is needed to\naccelerate growth.\n49. Accordingly, Government submitted a bill to Parliament requesting its approval to privatize TDB on\nJanuary 28, 2000. Government\u2019s intention, once it obtains Parliamentary approval of said bill, is to privatize a\ncontrolling share holding of TDB to a private strategic investor with recognized international banking experience\nvia  international  competitive  bidding.  The  Government  is  exploring  with  ADB  and  IFC  the  possibility  of\nparticipating, together with a private strategic investor, in the equity of the privatized TDB.\nCorporate Governance in Banking Institutions\n 50. Corporate governance in banking institutions is generally weak, further undermining market discipline.\nIn many instances, state-owned banks are operated by directors, many of whom were trained under the old\nsystem based on principles of directed lending. To address some of these issues, initial training has been\nprovided under IDA-assisted projects (BELTAC and Private Sector Development Project). On the other hand,\ncertain  private investors  are, in  some  instances,  interested  in  establishing  small  banks  not  as  a  sound\ninvestment option but as a means to finance their personal business activities.  The closed limited-liability nature\nof banks together with the absence of effective accountability, in many cases, encourages perpetuation of bad\nmanagement further undermining the development of sound and efficient private banks. In an effort to improve\ncorporate governance and strengthen internal control mechanisms in banks, BOM will, with technical assistance\nto be provided by ADB, prepare and issues guidelines on best practices in corporate governance in banking\ninstitutions, based on international best practices such as the guidelines issued by the Bank for International\nSettlements.\nLoan Collateral\n51. It is recognized that the expected approval of provisions in the Civil Code allowing for movable property\nto be offered as loan collateral will be an important step towards enhancing the supply of loanable funds in the\nbanking system. A second significant step will involve expanding the types of immovable property that can be\nused as collateral in secured transactions. A plan will be developed by the Government to analyze the feasibility\nof using other forms of immovable property as collateral. At another level, the Government will address under\nthe Financial Sector Reform Program issues relating to the Office for Immovable Property Registration relating\nto the relatively high cost of collateral registering and cumbersome administrative procedures that discourage\nregistration.\nBanking Supervision and Prudential Regulation\n52. Tightening selected prudential norms, together with a stronger failure resolution framework, will help\ncreate a sound banking system, reducing resource misallocation and wastage, improving long-run fiscal balance\nand contributing to faster economic growth and improved welfare.\n53. Minimum Capital Requirements. Minimum capital requirements have been low relative to the size of\nthe market and the scarcity of banking skills, allowing easy entry into the market and resulting in an excess\nnumber of banks\u2014as many as 18 in August 1998 (currently down to 12), most of which have performed weakly\nor failed. In this way, BOM supervisory resources and Mongolia\u2019s scarce banking skills have been stretched far\ntoo thin. On September 1, 1999 the MCR was raised from T400 million to T1 billion. On January 21, 2000, the\nBank of Mongolia issued a resolution that raised the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) for commercial\nbanks from T1 billion to T2 billion, effective starting June 30, 2001, except for new candidate banks, for which\nthe increase to T2 billion is effective immediately.", "Appendix 1, page 10\n54. With the new increase to T2 billion, the MCR has been raised by a multiple of 5 over the course of the\npast four months, for new banks, and has been raised by a factor of 5 during the August 1999-June 30, 2001\nperiod, for existing banks. On January 21, 2000, the Togrog (T) exchange rate was T1080 per U.S. dollar, so\nthat,  as  of  that  date,  the  new  minimum  capital  requirement  was  equivalent  to  about  US$1,850,000.  A\ncomparison of the new minimum capital requirement in Mongolia with those in other countries shows that\nMongolia\u2019s new MCR is relatively stringent.\n55. This new doubling in the MCR for banks will encourage a consolidation of existing commercial banks\ninto a smaller number of sounder banks that are capable of competing, and help ensure that any new entrants\ninto the market meet much more stringent capital requirements.  Also, the Bank of Mongolia intends to adjust\nthe MCR as needed, over the medium-term, to maintain its value in real terms.\n56. Asset Classification. Current regulations on asset classification deal only with loans. Losses, however,\nmay arise from other assets (including cash items; old outstanding \u201cwe debit\u201d items due from other banks; poor\nquality investments, suspense items; unresolved differences; accounts receivable, foreclosed or repossessed\nassets; and contingent liabilities). In addition, loans are currently considered past due only when principal and/or\ninterest is 90 days in arrears. The BOM is preparing a resolution that will strengthen the definition of past due\ncriteria and require recognition of losses that occur in asset types other than loans.\n57. Prompt Corrective Action. Prompt corrective action has not been implemented in the banking system,\nwith the result that banks with shaky financial conditions have deteriorated progressively. Only once banks\nbecome insolvent, and often then with lengthy delays, have actions been taken to redress the situation, inflicting\nlarge losses on Mongolian society.\n58. Over the medium-term, Government intends to amend banking legislation to adopt a prompt corrective\naction, with trigger points at 75% and 50% of the Capital Adequacy Ratio, to make corrective action much more\nautomatic, to depoliticize bank failure resolution, and to encourage banks to maintain higher levels of capital.\nThe Trigger points at 75% and 50% of the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) would automatically activate\nmandatory recapitalization actions including the development of a capital restoration program, prohibitions on\ndividends and restrictions on asset growth, capital-raising activities and changes in the mix of risk assets. The\nfinal threshold, at 25% of the minimum CAR, is a recognition that corrective actions have been unsuccessful and\nwould culminate in mandatory closure.\n59. Exit Policy. The Government intends to adopt a modern banking exit policy framework by amending\nthe current banking legislation on conservatorship and receivership, and including a new failure resolution\nscheme. This new framework will better preserve the asset values of the ongoing concern; increase the rights\nand choices of the depositors and other parties concerned; reduce moral hazard; accelerate resolution and\nliquidation, and reduce resolution costs. In addition, at present, an implicit state guarantee of all deposits is\nperceived to exist. The soundness and efficiency of the financial system would be improved with a stronger exit\npolicy that reduces moral hazard; limits the state\u2019s exposure; permits an effective transfer of assets from\ntroubled banks to sound institutions; and prevents contagion and reduces systemic risk.\n60. Over  the  medium-term,  Government  intends  to  strengthen  the  exit  policy  framework  through\namendments to the banking legislation. This framework will require that whenever the capital adequacy ratio\nfalls below 25% of the required level, the resolution framework is automatically activated without any further\npossibility of action by managers and shareholders, in order to protect depositors. Only the residual balance\nafter resolution will need to be sent to liquidation.\n61. Residual Assets. An improved framework is needed for liquidation of residual assets. With the July\n1999 modification of the Banking Law, a receiver can be appointed to restructure or liquidate a bank. However,\nthe authorities do not have all the legal tools needed to liquidate banks in an efficient manner. Further\namendments will be introduced to the Banking Law that provide for the process of liquidation of the residual\nassets of failed bank after the resolution process has taken place.\nStrengthening the Regulation of NBFIs\n62. In view of the limited outreach of the banking system and problems affecting financial intermediation, finance\ncompanies are expected to quickly assume a greater role in Mongolia. Prudential norms for the various categories of\nNBFIs need to be developed as the existing regulations are short on details. There is also a need to ensure that the\nSupervision Department of Bank of Mongolia (BOM) is properly organized to ensure effective supervision of NBFIs.", "Appendix 1, page 11\nAppropriate mechanisms need to be introduced including regulations on licensing requirements, risk-based prudential\nstandards and minimum paid-in capital to ensure a healthy non-bank financial system and avoid the fragility characteristic\nof the banking system.  BOM intends to (i) strengthen NBFI regulations requiring finance companies to comply with risk-\nbased prudential regulations; and (ii) assume oversight responsibility over savings and credit cooperatives through second\nand higher tier credit associations.\nAsset Recovery and Nonperforming Loans\n63. Mongolian Asset Recovery Agency. The Mongolian Asset Recovery Agency\u2019s (MARA) ability to\nrecover nonperforming assets is hampered by its insufficient authority; lack of funding, low salaries; and lengthy\ncourt delays. Government plans to strengthen the legal status and powers of MARA to collect and dispose of\nassets by passage of appropriate legislation. This legislation would provide MARA sufficient flexibility to quickly\nrealize assets, while opening-up asset collection to private agencies, in particular, it would enable MARA to sell\nrecovered assets at a discount and at auction, and to operate on a commercial basis.\n64. Credit Information Bureau. In order to improve loan repayment rates, the Bank of Mongolia also\nestablished a Credit Information Bureau. The information base on loan defaulters and mechanisms to share this\ninformation with banks is still in process of development. The BOM intends finalize arrangements to enhance\nthe effectiveness of the Credit Information Bureau by focusing data collection on loan defaulters and developing\na protocol for the sharing of this information in consultation with commercial banks. In order to strengthen\noperations and upgrade the capacity of banks, integrated banking information management system software for\ntreasury management, foreign exchange operations and other activities will be introduced on a pilot basis in\nTDB and then on a bank-wide basis in Mongolia.\nRationalizing the Payments System\n65. Bank restructuring needs to be done in such a way so as to avert a disruption in payments services in\nrural areas. At present, most payment services (government wages and pensions) in rural areas are performed\nby the Agricultural Bank. Government attaches a high priority to ensuring that payment services are not\ndisrupted. Government also intends to ensure that these services are provided through least-cost means.\n66. The monthly cost of operating an AB bank sub-branch limited to providing payment services at the soum\nlevel is about T160,000. If half of AB\u2019s 282 soum level sub-branches were considered essential in that these\nlocations could not be serviced from other soum or aimag branches of AB  or  other  banks,  the  cost  of\nmaintaining 141 sub-branches to provide payments services only would about T271 million per annum (about\nUS$245,000). Government plans to keep open those AB subranches needed to ensure continuity of payment\nservices in remote areas. Other potential service providers may bid for supplying this service. To this end,\nGovernment will define a strategic network of AB sub-branches that are essential to ensure payment services at\nthe soum level; on January 1, 2000 AB signed an agreement with the Social Insurance Department, whereby\nthe latter will pay for the transaction costs of distributing government wages and pensions throughout the\ncountry. Government also intends to remove any remaining impediments to entrance of new institutions in the\ndistribution of these payments.\nPublic Debt and Development of Financial Markets\n67. Creation of a government bond market would provide an alternative source of investment for banks and\nthe public; increase transparency in the management of budget deficits; and aid in the development of a capital\nmarket. At present, there is no legal framework on public debt. Government bonds are issued only to meet\nextraordinary financing needs. This impedes the creation of a market for government bonds and constrains\nmarket liquidity. Government plans to submit to Parliament a law on government debt and government debt\ninstruments. Given the close link to this issue, the Bank of Mongolia supports the development of an inter-bank\nmarket. An inter-bank market would provide banks in Mongolia a means to improve asset-liability management\nthrough the ability to invest surplus funds and reduce the costs of funding liquidity shortfalls. Legal, regulatory\nand policy considerations will be analyzed by Bank of Mongolia to help create a conducive environment for the\neventual development of an inter-bank market.", "Appendix 1, page 12\nDevelopment of Human Resources and Financial Infrastructure\n68. Developing  the  essential  infrastructure  to  complement  a  market-based  financial  system  including\nbanking skills, auditing and accounting standards, enforcement of financial contracts, and better enforcement of\nprudential  norms is  a  top  priority.  There  is  a  dearth  of  banking  skills,  especially  with  respect  to  credit\nassessment and loan management processes in commercial banks and regulatory processes in the BOM. In\nsome cases laws are not being enforced or are subject to inconsistent interpretation by the courts. The 1993\naccounting law required the adoption of international accounting standards. However, nine years into the\ntransition, most financial  statements  are  still  prepared  on  a  cash,  rather  than  an  accrual,  basis.  These\nstatements tend to minimize profits to lessen the tax burden and, since they are prepared on a cash basis, do\nnot reflect the true financial condition of the enterprise.\n69. There have been and are numerous programs to upgrade financial infrastructure, but these have lacked\nthe strategic basis and overall coordination needed to systematically develop this infrastructure. To that end,\nGovernment is preparing a comprehensive Financial Sector Infrastructure Action Plan for development of\nhuman resource skills in all facets of the financial sector and other basic building-blocks needed to support a\nhealthy financial  sector  including  banking  and  supervision  skills,  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and\nenforcement of financial contracts. Government has requested World Bank financial assistance to implement\nthis strategy and action plan, in the form of a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit.\n Development of the Capital Markets\n 70. The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  capital  markets  to  increase  domestic  resource\nmobilization and effectively allocate funds to those most productive activities.  The development of the capital\nmarkets would also increase the supply of long-term funds available in the economy. Over the short-term the\nGovernment will support actions that strengthen the operational and regulatory capacity of the MSEC and\nimprove investor confidence in the MSE.  In parallel, to increase the supply of quality stocks, the Government\nwill support the issuing of shares of some of the remaining 95 SOEs. In addition, the Government has\nincorporated under its Guidelines of the Cabinet for Economic and Social Development the submission to\nParliament of a Law on Trusts and a Law on Investment Funds in 2000 as part of efforts to establish the legal\nframework for new investment products. Finally, the Government is committed to the establishment of MSE,\nCDS and the securities clearing and settlement system as separate legal entities and subsequent privatization\nof them; as separate privatized institutions, they will foster the development of a more effective and professional\nsecurities exchange.\nConsensus-Building on Financial Sector Reform\n71. Government recognizes that implementation of its Medium-Term Strategy for Financial Sector Reform\nand Development requires a broad consensus in Mongolia, as well as the support of our external development\npartners. To this end, we have created a Financial Sector Development Performance Group (FSDPG as a forum\nto exchange ideas and reach broad consensus on the long-term vision and medium-term strategy for the\nfinancial sector. We expect this forum to monitor progress on a regular basis and determine if there is need to\nchange direction as the program evolves. The FSDPG includes high-level members of Government policy-\nmaking bodies (including the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Bank of\nMongolia, the Cabinet Secretariat and the State Property Committee); members of Parliament from all parties;\nNGO and private sector representatives; and donors representatives, including the ADB, GTZ, JICA, IMF,\nUSAID and World Bank.", "MONGOLIA: FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM *\nPOLICY MATRIX\nDevelopment Diagnosis Government Strategy/ IDA Board Tranche Policies\nObjectives/Key Actions Conditions/Status\nIssues\nIDA First Tranche/ IDA/ ADB Second IDA Floating\nCondition of Tranches Tranche\neffectiveness; ADB\nBoard Consideration /\nFirst Tranche\nMacroeconomic Framework\n\u2022  Mongolia needs high, \u2022  Growth averaged \u2022  Government\u2019s \u2022  Maintain a sound \u2022  Maintain a sound \u2022  Maintain a sound\nsustained labor-intensive 3.5% during1994-98, macro-economic policy macroeconomic macroeconomic macroeconomic\ngrowth to steadily raise according to official framework is designed to framework as framework as framework as\nliving standards and reduce statistics.

Introduction\n1. This appendix provides an assessment of the poverty impact of the Second Financial\nSector Program (FSP II).\nA.  Demographic Information and Human Development Indicators\n2. Mongolia has a population of 2.4 million people. About 1.2 million are of working age.\nThe average life expectancy is 64 years for both men and women. The infant mortality rate is 53\nper 100,000 live births. The average literacy rate is 96 percent.\nB. Poverty\n3. In 1991, the incidence of poverty was estimated at 15 percent of households. This\nincreased during the early 1990s as trade was disrupted following the breakup of the former\nSoviet Union. Subsequent economic developments with worsening terms of trade and  the\ntransition to a market-oriented economy may have contributed to the rise in poverty.\n4. The  World  Bank  undertook  a  living  standard  measurement  survey  in  1995,  and\nintroduced an expenditure-based poverty line to meet a calorie intake of 2,100 comparable with\nother developing countries. This study was replicated in 1998, and showed that the incidence of\npoverty remained stable at 36.3 percent of households in 1995, and 35.6 in 1998. The slow\ndecline follows from population growth.\n5. Poverty is found mainly in the small towns where workers are laid off from state-owned\nenterprises, and few other employment opportunities exist. Ulaanbaatar, with 25 percent of the\npopulation, is home to 17 percent of the poor; the incidence of poverty is lower here, than in the\ncountryside. Poverty is particularly severe among households headed by women (18.4 percent\nof all households and a poverty incidence of 60 percent), early pensioners (40 percent poverty\nincidence for men and 55 percent for women), unemployed, and herdsmen. Among people in\nwage employment and public servants, 48 percent are estimated to be moderately poor, which\nis higher than in the informal and agriculture sectors.\n6. In 1994, the Government introduced the National Poverty Alleviation Program with the\nobjectives of (i) reducing poverty through employment creation, (ii) protecting human capital\nthrough social infrastructure rehabilitation, (iii) addressing poverty among households headed\nby women, and (iv) strengthening the social safety net. The program is financed by aid. The\nmajor components are (i) income generation and microfinance, (ii) public works, (iii) targeted\nassistance, and  (iv)  capacity  and  institution  building.  During  1994-2000,  $15.3 million  was\nallocated for the program. Income-generating activities and microfinance has had little effect on\npoverty reduction as most of the credit tended to be used for consumption. While community-\nbased  public  works  programs  have  been  successful  for  income  generation  and  social\ninfrastructure  rehabilitation,  these  do  not  contribute  to  a  sustainable  reduction  of  poverty.\nVarious other program have been initiated to reduce unemployment, but there are no clear data\navailable that measure the impact of these.", "Appendix 4, page 2\nC. Labor Force Participation and Unemployment\n7. The official labor force is relatively small. By the end of 1998, only 809,500 workers were\nregistered, amounting to 67 percent of working age population and 34 percent of the total\npopulation. Each year, 25,000 people officially enter the labor force. However, there appear to\nbe growing job opportunities in the informal sector.\n8. At the end of 1998, 49,837 people were registered as unemployed and by July 1999, this\nhad fallen to 45,300. This can be explained by inaccurate statistics, and/or a reluctance among\nthe unemployed to register. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the unemployed are absorbed\ninto the informal sector.\nD.  The Financial Sector\n1. Financial Services Used by the Population\n9. Financial services in  Mongolia  are  rudimentary,  just  as they are  in  other  transition\neconomies.  Banks  engage  in  basic  deposit  taking  and  lending,  and  capital  markets  are\nunderdeveloped. Banking facilities tend to be concentrated in urban areas.\n10. Public confidence in banks is relatively low, as evidenced by the low deposit to gross\ndomestic product.\n2.  Employment in the Financial Sector\n11. The employment potential in the financial sector is limited. Banking employed 4,000\npersons as of May 2000 down from close to 4,000 at mid-1998. The reduction reflects the\nrestructuring and closure of eight banks. Three banks, Bank of Investment and Technological\nInnovation and Reconstruction Bank, currently under liquidation and Agricultural Bank, under\nrestructuring account for the share of retrenched workers. The average number of employees\nper bank is 170. In the longer term, employment opportunities should arise in the financial\nsector as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) develop, and the demand for financial services\ngrows, but during the FSP II period, the employment level is likely to remain stable or possibly\nexpand moderately.\nE. Policy Actions and their Impact on the Poor\n1. Improve the Soundness and Efficiency of Banking\n12. The objectives  are  to  restructure  and  rehabilitate  banks,  strengthen  regulation  and\nsupervision of banks, improve  corporate  governance  for  banking  sector,  strengthen  the\nmanagement information system for banks, and develop an interbank market.\n13. Implementation of this policy should improve the soundness and reliability of banks.\nProperly  regulated  and  supervised  banks  that  supply  adequate  and  timely  information  to\nauthorities and the population should increase public confidence in banks, and thereby increase\ndemand  for  services.  However,  banking  employs  few  people  and  therefore  the  effect  on\nemployment will be limited.", "Appendix 4, page 3\nTable A3.1: Poverty Impact of\n Improving the Soundness and Efficiency of the Banking System\nItem Direct Effect Indirect Effect Macro Mitigation Measures\nLabor Liquidation of banks Severance payments\nwill lead to job losses should mitigate the\neffect\nPrices Reduced  cost  of\ncapital\nAccess for the Government\npoor resources used to\nsupport banks will be\nfreed for productive\npurposes\nTransfers\nAssumptions A sound and efficient Stronger and better Improved  access  to\nbanking system will managed banks will credit\nsupport economic decrease the\ngrowth incidence and\ndisruptions due to\nbanking crises\nNet effect Overall positive\n2. Enhance the role of NBFIs\n14. The objective is to strengthen regulation and supervision of NBFIs. At present, NBFIs\nplay a minor role in financial intermediation. However, as the economy grows and the demand\nfor financial services increases, their role will expand. It is imperative that NBFIs grow in a well-\nregulated and supervised environment. In the longer term, NBFIs will also provide employment\nopportunities.\nTable A3.2: Poverty Impact of\nEnhancing the Role of NBFIs in Financial Intermediation\nItem Direct Effect Indirect Effect Macro Mitigation Measures\nLabor None\nPrices\nAccess for\npoor\nTransfers\nAssumptions Well-regulated and Improved  access  to\nsupervised NBFIs will credit\ncontribute to\nimproved financial\nintermediation and\nefficient allocation of\nresources\nTotal net effect Poor-neutral/positive\nNBFI  =  nonbank financial institution.\n3. Support and Facilitate Capital Market Development\n15. The objectives of this policy are to improve governance in equity markets, and establish\na legal infrastructure for capital market development.\n16. In  the  longer term, the  development  of  capital  markets  will  contribute  to  improved\nfinancial intermediation and resource allocation. The FSP II will ensure that capital markets", "Appendix 4, page 4\ndevelop in a sound legal environment, and that proper reporting and disclosure arrangements\nare in place to enhance transparency and contribute to good governance. While direct impacts\non the poor are negligible, there should be long-term indirect benefits in terms of employment\ncreation.\nTable A3.3: Poverty Impact of\nSupporting and Facilitating Capital Market Development\nItem Direct Effect Indirect Effect Macro Mitigation Measures\nLabor none Longer-term,\nemployment\nopportunities\nshould arise\nPrices Improve efficient\nallocation of capital\nAccess for\npoor\nTransfers\nAssumptions The Government Improve resource\nagencies concerned, mobilization\nand capital market\nparticipants will\nproperly implement\nthe required policy\nactions\nTotal net effect Poor to\nneutral/positive\n4.  Promote and Strengthen Contractual Savings Institutions\n17. The objectives are to improve the  administrative processes  in the  existing  pension\nsystem, prepare for transition to a reformed pension system, and improve regulations and\nsupervision of the insurance industry.\n18. Improvement  of  the administrative processes  in  the  pension  system  should  benefit\npensioners directly through more timely payment of pensions (assuming that pensions are\npaid). Reforms in the pension system will make it more sustainable in the long run, and thereby\nbenefit future pensioners. Improved regulation and supervision of the insurance industry will\nallow it to develop in an orderly manner that will indirectly benefit the population at large.\nTable A3.4: Poverty Impact of\nPromoting and Strengthening Contractual Savings Institutions\nItem Direct Effect Indirect Effect Macro Mitigation Measures\nLabor None\nPrices\nAccess for Timely payment of Longer term\npoor pensions viability of pension\nsystem\nTransfers\nAssumptions Timely\nimplementation of\npolicy actions by\nconcerned agencies\nTotal net effect Poor to\nneutral/positive", "Appendix 4, page 5\nE. Conclusion\n19. The benefits of this program can be summarized as follows:\n(i) A  consolidated,  restructured,  and  well-regulated  banking  system  should\ncontribute  to  increased  confidence  in  banking.  Furthermore,  Government\nresources will be freed to invest in infrastructure and social sector spending that\nwhich could otherwise be tied up in banking rehabilitation and which will benefit\nthe population as a whole.\n(ii) A well-functioning and resilient financial sector, including banks and a capital\nmarket,  will  provide  resources  for  real  economic  activity  that  will  create\nemployment opportunities for the population at large.\n(iii) In the longer term, efficient financial intermediation and allocation of resources\nwill support growth, a necessary condition for sustainable poverty reduction.", "Appendix 5\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS\n1.
