The  report  also  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity \nStrengthening for Sustainable Road Transport, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  proposed  project  will  improve  connectivity  in  Nepal  and  between  Nepal  and  its \n2. \nneighbors. The main investment is an alternate route in Sunsari and Saptari districts. This will \ncreate year-round passable conditions along the East\u2013West Highway (EWH), especially across \nthe  Koshi  River.  The  repair  of  three  feeder  roads  in  the  hill  areas  will  improve  connectivity \nbetween villages along this road system and better access to basic services. The project comes \nwith gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) plan, and the government staff will be trained \non road maintenance, planning and project management.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n Nepal is a landlocked country.  More than 70% of the area is mountainous terrain. Road \n3. \ntransport  is  central  to  economic  and  social  development,  accounting  for  almost  90%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  passenger  and  freight  movement.  Poor  road  connectivity  is  a  major  constraint  for \nNepal. Its road density is low\u201414 km per 100 km2 or 0.9 km per 1,000 people. The so-called \nstrategic  road  network  (SRN),  with  a  total  length  of  about  14,490  km  of  national  and  feeder \nroads,  is  the  core  of  Nepal\u2019s  roads  system.  It  carries  most  of  the  country\u2019s  road  traffic  and \nprovides linkages to major economic centers and neighboring countries. This network consists \nof  three  main  east\u2013west  corridors  and  several  north\u2013south  corridors.  The  east\u2013west  corridors \nincludes  the  EWH  (1,024  km).  This  is  the  main  artery  in  the  country  and  the  one  with  the \nheaviest  traffic  into  the  Terai  region.  The  East\u2013West  corridors  also  comprise  (i)  postal  roads \nrunning in parallel with the EWH along the Indian border to the south; and (ii) the Mid-Hill East\u2013\nWest Corridor (MHC), a series of feeder roads (1,700 km) that link mid-hill districts and the main \ncenters in the hills, including Kathmandu and Pokhara. \n\n4. \n Approximately 32% of the SRN is paved, while 23% is gravel, and 45% is earth. As the \nbackbone  of  Nepal\u2019s  national  highway  system,  the  EWH  must  meet  minimum  technical \nstandards and be passable all year round. While the EWH is in a reasonable condition, parts of \nthe highway, in particular the main Koshi Barrage in Sunsari District, are prone to damage from \nheavy floods and require alternate routes in case of closure. Nepal actively participates in the \nSASEC program. EWH is critical for domestic connectivity, but also key to link it to India.  \n\n5. \n Only 6% of the MHC is paved. The government wants to improve the entire 1,700 km \nstretch  into  all-weather  maintainable  standard.  This  will  connect  communities  and  provide \naccess to basic services. There is also a need to improve north\u2013south linkages between EWH \nand MHC.  \n\n6. \nNepal\u2019s transport strategy is set out in the Three Year Plan (2010\u20132013). This is based \non  a  Sector  Wide  Road  Program  and  Priority  Investment  Plan  (2007\u20132017).2   Key  priorities \n\n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The World Bank. 2007. Sector Wide Road Program and Priority Investment Plan. Kathmandu. \n\n\f \n\ninclude  (i)  connecting  the  regional  centers  and  all  75  district  headquarters,  (ii)  completing  the \nMHC, and (iii) strengthening the road maintenance. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport (MPIT) is responsible for road network planning and road sector policies. Under MPIT, \nthree  agencies  have  responsibilities  related  to  road  network  management.  The  Department  of \nRoads (DOR) is responsible for network planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the \nSRN. The Department of Transport Management (DOTM) is responsible for vehicle registration \nand  renewal,  vehicle  inspection,  overloading  control,  route  permits,  and  driving  licenses.  The \nRoads Board Nepal (RBN) is mandated to create a road fund through the collection of road user \ncharges. The RBN approves the DOR's annual road maintenance plan and monitors the use of \nfunds allocated to it. \n\n7. \nMaintenance work is funded from fuel levies and registration fees. For 2012, $30 million \nwere allocated for regular, periodic and recurrent maintenance. This level of funding will need to \nincrease in line with the expansion of the road network. While a road asset management system \nis in place, and tolling and performance-based maintenance contracts are in use, improvement \nof both schemes is necessary. An integrated road maintenance scheme needs to be developed. \nThere  is  also  a  need  to  improve  the  collaboration  and  coordination  work  by  DOR,  DOTM  and \nRBN.  \n\nThe alternate EWH route, connecting to the new bridge over the Koshi River at Chatara,3 \n8. \nwill  ensure  that  the  EWH  is  passable  year  round.  The  upgraded  feeder  roads  in  the  mid-hill \nregion will facilitate regionally balanced economic growth. The feeder road in the Indian border \narea  is  one  of  the  key  sections  of  the  SASEC  corridor  (Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Phulbari\u2013\nBanglabandha),  which  connects  to  NH31  in  India  and  NH5  in  Bangladesh.  Work  in  these \nsections  will  complement  work  under  a  SASEC  Trade  Facilitation  Program. 4 The  project  is \nincluded  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2012\u20132014,5 and  the  South  Asia  Regional \nCooperation Operations Business Plan, 2013\u20132015.6 \n\n The  project  will  improve  local  and  regional  connectivity.  The  outcome  will  be  an \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nimproved road transport system in eastern Nepal.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  roads  upgraded  to  all-weather  standard  with  community \nparticipation  and  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  MPIT  (DOR,  DOTM  and  RBN)  in  road  asset \nmanagement and road maintenance, and enhanced capacity of DOR to deliver gender equality \nand  social  inclusion  following  completion  of  GESI  guidelines  for  the  road  subsector.  These \noutputs will be achieved through the Project and the TA.  \n\n11. \nThe project will upgrade about 73 km of bypass road and border road along EWH to two-\nlane standard and about 114 km of MHC7 to intermediate-lane standard.

The \nDOR  has  previously  carried  out  e-procurement  up  to  the  stage  of  e-submission  of  bids  for \nprojects funded domestically and by development partners. This work was efficient and effective \nin enhancing transparency and fair competition. \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nA TA will be provided for strengthening sustainable road maintenance. The objective is \nto improve the capacity of three agencies: the DOR, DOTM, and RBN. The TA has three major \noutputs:  (i)  an  integrated  road  maintenance  scheme,  (ii)  a  road  user  charge  scheme,  and  (iii) \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nupgraded software for a highway management information system. The TA costs $570,000, of \nwhich $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government will provide the balance. An international consulting firm \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants to help with this \nwork. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n19. \nBased  on  the  feasibility  study  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  in  2010, \ndetailed design of the five project roads has been prepared.9 The design of road embankment \nand  drainage  structures  has  taken  into  consideration  the  likely  effects  of  climate  change. \nBioengineering  techniques  have  been  adopted  as  a  slope  protection  measure  for  the  mid-hill \nroads.10 These have been successfully applied in several road projects in Nepal, and the DOR\u2019s \nexpertise in this area is recognized. A road safety audit was performed as part of the detailed \ndesign  and  the  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the  final  product.  With  bidding \ndocuments  ready,  advance  actions  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  construction  can \ncommence early.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nEconomic viability. The benefits of the project will be savings in vehicle operating costs \nand travel time.11 The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 21.7% to \n30.6% for individual project roads. The overall estimated EIRR is 26.4%. The sensitivity analysis \nfurther confirms the robustness of economic viability. When the construction costs increase by \n10% or the traffic volume decreases by 10%, the EIRR is still above 12%. \n \nIn  addition,  the  project  will  bring  significant  benefits  to  overall  regional  development. \n21. \nEven with the closure of Koshi Bridge during heavy flooding and/or landslides, transport along \nthe EWH would not be disrupted. Local communities will benefit from construction employment. \nAfter  project  completion,  they  will  have  access  to  markets  which  will  result  in  increased \nhousehold income. The benefits accrued from savings in vehicle operating costs will be passed \non to the poor through lower freight rates, lower passenger fares, and time savings. Households \nin remote areas will benefit from an increase in the availability of goods and a decrease in prices.  \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  Recurrent  costs  on  project  roads  will  decrease  after  the \n22.  \nconstruction is completed. In the long term, incremental recurrent costs are estimated at 7% of \nthe  current  DOR  maintenance  budget,  and  less  than  1%  of  the  overall  annual  DOR  budget. \nMaintenance will be required after 2018. By then, the government is committed to doing this. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nInstitutional. The DOR has a good track record of implementing ADB-financed projects. \nIt  has  sufficient  capacity.  This  capacity  is  further  increased  by  a  World  Bank  project  and  an \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2010.

A  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out.  The \nDOR  has  developed  capacity  in  financial  accounting  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  The \nDOR  project  directorate  will  have  a  qualified  chief  project  accountant  and  two  assistant \naccountants. The DOR will also establish and maintain separate project records and accounts \nto identify the financing resources received and expenditures made under the project, ensuring \nan adequate audit trail. The government's Office of the Auditor General will annually audit the \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing \nstandards.  To  further  minimize  risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for \nsubstantial disbursements for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n25. \n Procurement  and  anticorruption.  The  government  has  promulgated  the  Public \nProcurement  Act  (2007)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations  (2007),  both  of  which  are \ngenerally  acceptable  to  ADB  and  encompass  best  international  procurement  practices.  The \nPublic Procurement Monitoring Office has been assigned as the national procurement oversight \nbody  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers.  The  government  will \npublish  information  on  the  project  on  DOR\u2019s  website,  including  business  opportunities \nassociated  with  the  project,  and  information  on  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting \nservices.  E-submission of  bids  which  has  substantially  increased  transparency  and  fairness in \nbidding competition of in the previous ADB road project will be adopted.14 \n \n26. \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty reduction and social impact. The Nepal Living Standard Survey conducted by \n27. \nthe  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  during  1995\u20132011  revealed  a  substantial  decrease  in  poverty \nover  recent  years.  However,  the  overall  poverty  situation  in  Nepal  still  remains  serious.  More \nthan 25% of the population lives below the government poverty line of NRs19,261 (about $246) \nper year. Rural poverty is almost twice as high as urban poverty. Poverty incidence is 34%\u201357% \nin  project-affected  rural  districts,  compared  with  25%  nationally.  In  the  project  districts  of \nRamechhap,  Khotang,  Sunsari,  Udayapur,  Bhojpur,  Saptari,  and  Jhapa,  a  large  proportion  of \nthe  population  is  indigenous.  Most  of  these  districts  are  also  food  insecure.  Difficulties  with \ntransport  limit  people\u2019s  ability  to  take  their  agricultural  products  to  markets.  The  results  of \nhousehold  surveys  and  focus  group  discussions  conducted  as  part  of  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment indicate that the project will increase economic and employment opportunities, as \nwell as, access to markets, production centers, and public and social services.  \n \n28. \nGender.  A  gender  analysis  highlights  the  type  of  benefits  accruing  from  road  projects. \nFocus  group  discussions  with  women  in  the  project  areas  indicate  that  improved  access  to \n\n                                                 \n12 The  World  Bank\u2019s  support  focuses  on  management  information  systems,  road  safety,  safeguard  implementation, \n\nquality control, and human resources management. \n\n13 ADB. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant and Loan to Nepal for the Subregional Transport Enhancement Project. Manila (Grant 0225-NEP for \n$24.5 million and Loan 2685-NEP for 24.5 million). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nmarkets  and  basic  services  will  improve  significantly  health  and  education  outcomes, \nparticularly  among  women  and  children.  Most  local  women,  who  currently  travel  by  foot  on \nearthen  tracks  that  are  impassable  during  the  rainy  season,  will  have  safer,  faster,  and  more \ncomfortable  access  once  the  investments  are  completed.  Cash-strapped  subsistence  farmers, \nincluding  women,  will  benefit  from  other  activities  such  as  short-term  employment  in  road \nconstruction and maintenance. \n \n29. \n\nA GESI plan incorporates the following gender mainstreaming features:  \n(i)  At  least  50%  of  those trained  and engaged  in bioengineering  for  slope  protection \nworks  will  be  women  from  local  communities. 15  This  will  be  facilitated  by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n\n(ii)  At least 50% of those engaged in compensatory afforestation will be women. This \nwill  be  conducted  in  a  partnership  between  community  forest  users  and  NGOs \n(footnote 15). \n\n(iii)  At  least  40%  of  those  trained  and  engaged  as  eco-guardians  will  be  women \n\n(footnote 15).  \n\n(iv)  At least 40% of those participating in road safety awareness sessions carried out \n\nfor affected communities in local languages will be women.  \n\n(v)  At  least  50%  of  those  participating  in  sexually  transmitted  infection  (STI)  and \n\nhuman trafficking awareness campaigns will be women. \n\n \n30. \nThe bidding documents have clauses to ensure that all civil work contractors comply with \nlabor  laws  by  not  employing  child  labor;  encouraging  employment  of  the  poor  (particularly \nwomen);  and  paying  the  same  wage  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Special \nprovisions for vulnerable households\u2014including those headed by women\u2014are provided in the \ncombined indigenous people and resettlement plans. A full time national GESI consultant will be \nplaced  in  DOR.  An  international  GESI  consultant  will  assist  DOR  finalize  guidelines  for \nmainstreaming  GESI  in  the  road  sector.  An  NGO  will  carry  out  livelihood  enhancement  and \nawareness programs on road safety, STIs, and human trafficking.  \n  \n31. \nHIV  and  human  trafficking.  The  National  Center  for  AIDS  and  Sexually  Transmitted \nDisease  Control  under  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Population  coordinates  activities  by \nstakeholders  committed  under  the  National  AIDS  Strategy,  2006\u20132011. 16  This  emphasizes \nprevention  as  the  most  effective  response.  Anti-human  trafficking  activities  are  coordinated  by \nthe  Ministry  of  Women,  Children,  and  Social  Welfare.  A  large  amount  of  information  and  print \nmaterial on human trafficking has been developed with the support of the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development,  which  now  be  reproduced  for  use  in  project  areas.  The  project \nincorporates measures to mitigate HIV risks by having NGOs undertake awareness programs in \nthe corridors of influence. The contractors will carry out STI and human trafficking awareness for \ntheir laborers at work sites, which will be monitored by the construction supervision consultant \n(CSC). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n Social  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  assessed  (and  will  be  mitigated)  in \n32. \naccordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  regulations  and \npolicies. All safeguard aspects (environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) \nare  classified  as  category  A.  The  combined  indigenous  peoples  and  resettlement  plans, \n\n                                                 \n15 Subject to availability of women volunteers in the project areas. \n16 National Center of AIDS and STD Control. 2011. National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  reports,  and  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nreports  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  have  been  reviewed, \nupdated  and  disclosed.  The  DOR  has  sufficient  capacity  in  implementing  environment  and \nsocial safeguard plans. This has been demonstrated in the previous ADB projects. \n \n 33. \n Environment.  The  alternate  route  for  EWH  falls  under  category  A.  It  traverses  an \nelephant corridor and also passes through the buffer zone of the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, \nwhich  is  a  Ramsar  site.17 The  potential  adverse  impacts  identified  are  disturbance  of  elephant \nmovement mainly due to increased traffic from the improved road and worsening of the existing \nhuman\u2013wildlife  conflicts  and  wildlife  disturbance  in  the  project  area.  The  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  which  is  a  key  part  of  the  contractor\u2019s  bidding  documents,  includes \nmeasures  to  address  adverse  impacts  during  all  stages  of  project.  Another  component  of  the \nEMP is focused on a combination of biodiversity enhancement and gender-inclusive activities. \nThis  will  be  implemented  by  a  local  NGO  in  collaboration  with  existing  conservation  and \nlivelihood projects in the project area. Consultations have been carried out at various stages of \nproject  development  and  advice  was  sought  from  local  communities,  the  wildlife  reserve\u2019s \nmanagement,  government  agencies,  and  local  and  international  NGOs.  The  EIA  report  was \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 23 November 2012.   \n \n34. \nThe four feeder roads to be upgraded, (Leguwaghat\u2013Bhojpur, Halesi\u2013Diktel, Mechipul\u2013\nBirtamod, and Manthali\u2013Ramechhap) are classified under category B. They do not fall inside or \nnear  protected  areas  or  critical  habitats.  Most  impacts  from  these  roads  are  likely  to  occur \nduring  construction,  and  are  associated  with  earth  movement,  ground  shaping,  heavy \nequipment operation, and possible landslide and erosion. Appropriate mitigation measures are \nincluded in the respective EMPs, which will also feature in contract bidding documents. Public \nconsultations  have  been  conducted  with  local  communities  and  government  agencies  during \npreparation of the IEE reports. The reports have been disclosed on the ADB website as required \nby the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n35. \nThe DOR project directorate will have an environmental focal person to coordinate and \noversee  proper  implementation  of  all  environment  safeguards.  Technical  support  will  be \nprovided  by  the  Geo-Environment  and  Social  Unit  (GESU),  which  is  responsible  for \nimplementing  and  monitoring  social  and  environment  safeguards  for  all  DOR  projects.  The \nGESU has received capacity building assistance from various international agencies, including \nADB.  Its  team  is  capable  and  experienced.  The  CSC  team  includes  an  environmental  expert \nthat  will  supervise  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs  by  the  contractor.  Biodiversity \nenhancement activities for the EWH road components will be implemented by a local NGO (in \nclose  collaboration  with  the  local  Forestry  Department,  and  the  Department  of  National  Parks \nand  Wildlife  Conservation).  A  training  and  coordination  workshop  will  be  conducted  before \nproject implementation to clarify the roles and responsibilities of all project stakeholders. Semi-\nannual environmental monitoring reports for all the project roads will be prepared for disclosure \non the ADB website in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36. \nThe upgrading of the alternate EWH route is a climate change adaptation measure. The \nexisting  EWH  becomes  inaccessible  due  to  breaching  of  the  Koshi  Barrage  by  excess  water \nand  silt  being  brought  down  to  the  Terai  from  the  mountains.  With  climate  change  and  an \nincrease  in  glacial  melting  at  the  headwaters  of  the  Koshi  River,  this  problem  is  expected  to \nbecome worse. Improvement of the existing EWH would be very expensive. The alternate road \n\n                                                 \n17  The  Ramsar  Convention  (The  Convention  on  Wetlands  of  International  Importance,  especially  as  Waterfowl \n\nHabitat) is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nis  located  north  of  the  existing  EWH  and  the  Koshi  Barrage.  The  terrain  in  the  project  area  is \nhilly and the deep gorge and steep slope allows the excess water to flow southward, hence the \nlikelihood of floods and damage to the road and Chatara Bridge is less. The alternate route is \nless  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  The  engineering  design  of  the  project  roads  has  been \nprepared  taking  into  account  climate  change  considerations  (temperature  and  rainfall). \nMeasures  taken  include  raising  road  embankments  and  bridge  heights,  strengthening  road \nsurfaces,  improving  drainage  structures,  and  bioengineering  on  unstable  slopes  and  erosion-\nprone areas. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project design minimizes land \nacquisition and  involuntary  resettlement  while  adopting  the  most  feasible  technical  features. A \nfull census of the areas was conducted. Combined indigenous peoples and resettlement plans \nhave been prepared for three of the project roads and resettlement due diligence reports have \nbeen prepared for two others in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the Land \nAcquisition Act 1977, and other national laws and regulations. \n \nThe  project  will  result  in  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  A  total  of  76.49 \n38. \nhectares of private land will be acquired. Major impacts will be on 1,982 households, 1,383 of \nwhich will be physically displaced. Thus, 11,181 people will be affected. The total resettlement \nbudget for the project is $11.8 million. Compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, \nrelocation assistance, income restoration assistance, and additional support for vulnerable and \nindigenous  groups  are  provided  in  the  entitlement  matrix.  The  combined  plans  outline  the \ncompensation entitlements. These have been endorsed by the MPIT and an adequate budget \nhas been allocated. Consultation and information disclosure were undertaken with (i) people to \nbe displaced, (ii) indigenous peoples\u2019 households in the project areas and their leaders, and (iii) \nthe public through the ADB website. If any changes, additional land requirements, or involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  identified,  a  new  or  updated  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  or \nmodified  according  to  the  laws  referred  to  in  the  resettlement  plan.  ADB\u2019s  approval  will  be \nobtained  before  further  implementation  of  the  relevant  section  of  the  project  roads  can  take \nplace.  The  DOR  project  directorate  will  have  a  resettlement  and  safeguards  focal  person  to \ncoordinate and oversee proper implementation of the combined plans. Technical support will be \nprovided  by  GESU.  The  CSC  team  will  include  a  resettlement  expert  that  will  guide  and \nsupervise implementation of the combined plans. The DOR will submit the monitoring reports to \nADB on a semiannual basis. \n \n39. \nThe government has declared 59 groups as indigenous peoples, or \u201cJanjatis\u201d as they are \ncommonly known, comprising about 37.2% of Nepal\u2019s population. Indigenous peoples make up \nabout 39% of the project district populations and 28% of the total household populations in the \nroad  influence  areas.  Consultations  with  indigenous  groups  and  their  leaders  were  conducted \nas  part  of  the  social  impact  assessment,  and  the  census  survey.  This  was  done  in  an \natmosphere  free  of  coercion  and  in  a  culturally  sensitive  manner.  This  was  to  ensure  a \ncomprehensive  perspective  on  the  project  and  its  impacts,  to  ascertain  community  responses \nand their needs and demands from the project, to estimate the losses they would suffer, and to \ntake steps to mitigate those losses. This process is to make sure that indigenous peoples will \nnot be affected more than the rest of the population and will have culturally appropriate benefits \nfrom the socioeconomic opportunities created by the project. The project will not have adverse \nimpacts on the identity, culture, and customary livelihoods of the indigenous people. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\n40. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.
