A water supply development subproject will be implemented in \nDharan municipality. The project will also undertake community development programs (CDPs), \nfocusing primarily on poverty pockets in the municipalities and communities that may not benefit \ndirectly from major infrastructure improvement subprojects. Gender equality and social inclusion \n(GESI) will be mainstreamed in all subprojects in the municipalities, and the capacity to address \nGESI  in  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  will  be  strengthened  by \nestablishing an appropriate institutional structure and mechanisms for GESI mainstreaming. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  pace  of  urbanization  in  Nepal  has  increased  markedly  during  2001\u20132011  with  an \nurban population growth rate of 3.4% per annum, compared with national population growth of \n1.4% per annum. In 2011, 17% of the population was estimated to live in urban areas, up from \n9.2%  in  1991  and  13.9%  in  2001.  While  global  experience  clearly  demonstrates  that \nurbanization  is  an  important  driver  of  economic  development,  the  potential  has  not  been \nadequately  tapped  in  Nepal.  In  the  absence  of  a  stringent  policy  regulating  and  managing \ngrowth,  uncontrolled  and  haphazard  urban  development  has  created  numerous  problems, \nincluding  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  services;  environmental  degradation;  encroachment  on \npublic land, forests, and river banks; and sprawling settlement development. Most municipalities \nin  Nepal  lack  properly  engineered  and  operated  sanitary  landfills,  and  have  limited  and \nintermittent  water  supply  services,  poorly  maintained  road  infrastructure,  and  inadequate \ndrainage systems that cause recurrent waterlogging problems, mainly in the Terai.3  The Local \nSelf Governance Act mandates a wide range of functions and responsibilities to municipalities, \nbut the lack of financial and qualified human resources and a low level of institutional capacity \nmake  providing  infrastructure  facilities  commensurate  with  the  growing  demand  for  services  a \nmajor challenge. Poor health, caused by the poor urban environment, saps economic growth by \nreducing  labor  productivity  and  educational  attainment.  Disease,  associated  economic  burden, \nand premature death disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n4. \nThe  National  Urban  Policy  (NUP)  adopted  by  the  Government  of  Nepal  in  2007  gives \npriority  to  (i)  achieving  a  balanced  national  urban  structure  by  directing  infrastructure \ndevelopment and investment;4 (ii) improving the quality of urban life through creation of a clean, \nsafe, and well-developed urban environment; and (iii) setting up effective urban management by \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA), financed on a grant \n\nbasis from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n\n3  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n4  A \"balanced national urban structure\" consists of urban development that is  equally managed  in all development \n\nregions. \n\n \n\n\fempowering  capable  local  institutions.  Both  the  NUP  and  the  government\u2019s  Three-Year  Plan \nApproach  Paper  (FY2011\u2013FY2013)  place  municipalities  at  the  core  of  the  urban  development \nagenda,  and  support  strengthening  local  bodies,  so  they  can  effectively  implement  urban \ndevelopment  plans  and  mobilize  local  resources.  Although  the  policy  intent  is  clear,  effective \nimplementation  of  the  policy  framework  is  hindered  by  numerous  problems,  including  the \nabsence  of  people\u2019s  representatives  in  local  bodies,  lack  of  technical  and  skilled  local-level \nmanpower, failure to execute important aspects of decentralization and devolution, and lack of \nclarity  in  the  roles  of  and  collaboration  among  government  ministries,  local  bodies,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \n5. \nUrban services are scarce outside Kathmandu Valley. Physical limitations restrict further \ndevelopment in the valley, and there is an urgent need to improve the environment in potential \nurban  centers  to  promote  social  and  economic  development  in  other  regions  of  Nepal.  The \ngovernment, represented by the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction \n(DUDBC), developed the criteria for selecting strategically important towns. Dharan, Janakpur, \nNepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar were chosen for the project on the basis of (i) economic growth \npotential,  (ii)  demand  for  urban  services,  and  (iii)  urban  management  capacity.5 The  project \ndirectly addresses and conforms to the development policy of Nepal, as expressed in the NUP \nand Three-Year Plan Approach Paper, by improving the environment of urban centers that work \nas  catalysts  for  economic  development,  which  will  help  contribute  to  the  \u2015employment-centric, \nequitable, and inclusive economic growth\u2016 emphasized by the approach paper. \n \n6. \nUrban infrastructure and facilities have tended not to fully recognize social differences in \nthe needs of women, the poor, and excluded groups. People living in municipal poverty pockets \nexperience  discrimination  based  on  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity,  and  multiple  exclusions \nconstrain  their  progress  and  access  to  services.  Their  participation  in  community  activities  is \nlimited  due to  lack  of  access to information  and resources,  although  progress  has been made \nthrough support for their empowerment and mobilization from various NGOs and development \npartners. To be effective, urban development must integrate GESI. \n \n7. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  the  Nepal  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),6 which  rests  on  four  pillars:  broad-based  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth,  inclusive  social  development,  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  climate  change \nadaptation  and  environmental  sustainability.  Reflecting  lessons  from  similar  projects, 7  the \nproject  (i)  focuses  on  a  small  number  of  physically  integrated  components,  to  simplify  project \nadministration  and  optimize  inter-sector  linkages;  (ii)  is  confined  to  larger  municipalities  with \nrelatively higher technical and financial capacity to implement the project and create discernable \ndevelopment  impacts;  (iii)  fully  involves  stakeholders,  including  communities,  in  project \nidentification and design from an early stage; (iv) provides capacity development support before \n                                                \n5  This  process  was  supported  by  ADB.  2008.

Dharan is the second largest municipality in the eastern region after \nBiratnagar,  and  rapidly  growing  as  a  major  trading  center  and  educational  and  health  services  hub  with  a \npopulation of 119,000 in 2011. Janakpur is considered a key regional hub in the central region, with a population of \n100,000 in 2011. Nepalgunj is referred to in the NUP as the potential regional economic center in the mid-western \nregion with a population of 76,000 in 2011 (the largest in the region). Siddharthanagar is a rapidly growing regional \ntrading hub (along with Butwal) in the western region, with a population of 65,000 in 2011.  \n\n6  ADB. 2009.

The outcome will be to provide population in these \nmunicipalities with better access to municipal infrastructure and services in a socially inclusive \nmanner. \n \nC. \n \n9. \n \n10. \ninfrastructure  developed.  Subprojects  will  be \nimplemented to develop reliable municipal infrastructure in accordance with the priorities set by \nthe municipalities in their periodic plans.9 \n \n11. \nDrainage  and  roads.  Three  project  municipalities  on  the  flat  land  of  the  Terai  are \nchronically  waterlogged\u2014particularly  Nepalgunj  and  Siddhrthanagar,  and  to  a  lesser  extent \ninadequate,  poorly  built,  and  poorly  maintained  drainage  and \nJanakpur\u2014because  of \nobstructions  from  solid  waste  dumping.10 There  is  no  overall  planning,  leading  to  haphazard \nconstruction on a piecemeal basis, and drainage capacity is reduced in some natural drains due \nto encroachment. Pipes carrying untreated sewage effluent are often connected to the drainage \nsystem,  causing  bad  odors  and  public  health  risks.  These  systems  will  be  improved  under  a \ncomprehensive  drainage  development  plan  to  alleviate  waterlogging  and  reduce  the  resulting \ndamage to assets, economic activities, and human health. Future increases in rainfall intensity \nwill be addressed during the drainage system detailed design to strengthen urban resilience to \nclimate change. Urban roads are dilapidated, especially in Janakpur, and they will be restored \nor upgraded in areas where drainage network improvements are undertaken. \n \n12. \nSolid waste management. Waste collection coverage in Janakpur is estimated at 40%, \nin Nepalgunj at 70%, and in Siddharthanagar at 56%. Without a sanitary landfill, collected waste \nis  dumped  haphazardly  along  riverbanks  and  into  open  spaces,  causing  pollution  and  public \nhealth hazards. Littering of waste in drains is common, segregation at source is rarely practiced, \nand waste recycling is far below the optimum level. The project will take an integrated approach \nto SWM by reviewing and improving the entire system, including (i) segregation and collection; \n(ii)  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and  recycling;  and  (iii)  transportation  and  final  disposal  at  the \nsanitary  landfill  site,  including  resource  recovery  facilities  in  Janakpur,  Nepalgunj,  and \n\n                                                \n8  Capacity  development  TA  was  provided  to  the  project  municipalities  to  (i)  prepare  a  comprehensive  financial \nmanagement  improvement  plan  for  each  municipality  that  includes  measures  for  revenue  enhancement  and \nimproving  accounting  and  auditing  practices;  and  (ii)  strengthen  technical  capacity  of  municipal  staff  through \ntraining  programs  on  solid  waste  management,  water  supply  and  sanitation  (including  drainage),  geographic \ninformation  systems,  and  infrastructure  planning.  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of Municipalities. Manila. As the TA was mainly intended for the municipalities supported under the \nSecondary  Towns  Integrated  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  another  capacity  development  TA  was \napproved to  assist  the  project  municipalities in implementing  comprehensive  financial management  improvement \nplans, including revenue enhancement, and improving urban planning.  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Nepal \nfor Strengthening Municipalities for Urban Service Delivery. Manila. \n\n9  Periodic  plans  are  medium-term  development  plans  prepared  by  each  municipality  through  a  participatory \napproach, as required by the Local Self Governance Act (1999). A periodic plan was prepared in Dharan in 2010 \nand in the other three municipalities in 2011. \n\n10 Dharan has reasonable natural slopes and very porous soil, and drainage problems are not observed.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fSiddharthanagar.11 Strengthening waste reduction, reuse, and recycling will lead to a reduction \nin greenhouse gas emissions, and extend the service life of and reduce pollution risks at landfill \nsites. The possibility of private sector participation in SWM services (including landfill operation) \nwill  be  explored  by  incorporating  management  services  in  the  civil  works  contract  to  ensure \neffective and efficient operation of the system.12 \n \n13.  Water  supply.  As  there  is  no  known  accessible  groundwater  in  the  town  and  very \nlimited other reliable sources, there is complete dependence on the piped water supply system \nin Dharan.  Dharan  suffers  low  service levels  provided by  the  Nepal Water  Supply  Corporation \nwith only 4 hours per day of supply in the dry season.13 Water supply subproject in Dharan will \ninclude (i) development of new deep tubewells for water supply augmentation, (ii) rehabilitation \nand  replacement  of  existing  system  to  enhance  efficiency  including  non-revenue  water \nreduction, and (iii) expansion of the distribution network to increase the coverage to 95% from \ncurrent 83%.  The project will support the establishment of Dharan Water Supply Management \nBoard14 (DWSMB),  which  will  take  charge  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  including  (i) \nasset  valuation  and  transfer,  (ii)  institutional  development  including  the  drafting  of  regulations \nand a business plan, and (iii) system integration. \n \n14. \nConsulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  support  for  the  initial \noperation of facilities created under the project will be provided. The services will also include (i) \nsupport in setting and collecting adequate tariffs, taxes, and other charges to ensure sustainable \nO&M; and (ii) assessment of the appropriate O&M arrangement, particularly for integrated SWM \nfacilities. \n \nOutput 2: Community development programs undertaken and gender equality and \n15. \nsocial \nthe \ninclusion  capacity  strengthened.  This  output  will  be  achieved \nimplementation of (i) CDPs in the project municipalities; and (ii) capacity development activities \nfor  gender  and  social  inclusion  mainstreaming  in  the  MPPW,  its  three  departments, 15  and \nproject municipalities. The CDPs will mainly focus on poverty pockets in the municipalities and \ncommunities  that  may  not  benefit  directly  from  major  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects \nand will consist of (i) investment in small-scale community infrastructure chosen in accordance \nwith the subproject selection criteria,16 such as public and community toilets, lane and drainage \nimprovements,  community  composting  facilities,  and  community  water  taps;  (ii)  social \nmobilization  and  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  with  a  particular \nemphasis on health and hygiene education and waste reduction, reuse, and recycling activities; \nand (iii) skill and entrepreneurship development targeting women, the poor, and the excluded. A \nportion  of  the  community  infrastructure  work  may  be  used  to  support  access  by  the  poor  to \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  at  the  individual  household  level,  such  as  private  latrines  and \nprivate connections to water supply services through performance-based grants such as output-\nbased aid. Activities pertaining to GESI will include (i) formation of structures and mechanisms \nfor GESI mainstreaming in the MPPW and its departments; (ii) preparation of GESI operational \nmanuals, toolkits, and checklists for road, water supply and sanitation, and urban development \noperations;  (iii)  technical  training  programs  for  MPPW  staff  and  departments,  and  project \n                                                \n11 A regional SWM project is being implemented in Dharan. \n12 The assessment during project preparation suggests a 3\u20135 year management contract be incorporated in the civil \n\nthrough \n\nwork contract, while further work will be made before finalizing the arrangement.  \n\n13 This is in contrast with other three municipalities, where shallow and private tubewells are widely available despite \n\nthe lower coverage of piped water supply. \n\n14 This will follow the Water Supply Management Board Act (2006).  \n15 Department of Roads, DUDBC, and Department of Water Supply and Sewerage. Their regional directorates and \n\ndivisional offices will also be covered. \n\n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fmunicipalities; and (iv) review and revision of policies and regulations relevant to sectors under \nthe jurisdiction of MPPW for GESI integration. \n \n16. \nNGOs  will  be  engaged  by  the  municipalities  to  assist  in  CDP  implementation,  and \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  MPPW  for  capacity  development  of  the  MPPW  and  its \ndepartments.  Design  and  supervision  consultants  will  assist  in  institutional  strengthening  of \nproject municipalities on GESI issues. \n \nOutput  3:  Project  management  and  administration  supported.  Support  will  be \n17. \nprovided  for  smooth  and  effective  project  implementation  and  operation  by  the  central \ngovernment and project municipalities. The project coordination office (PCO) in the DUDBC will \nmanage overall project implementation, assisted by the project management support consultant. \nThe project implementation units (PIUs) in each project municipality will implement infrastructure \nimprovement and CDP. The GESI unit will be established in the MPPW to mainstream GESI in \nits operations and those of its three departments, with support from the consultants. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $83.9  million.

In  Janakpur,  Nepalgunj,  and \nSiddharthanagar, priority areas for drainage improvement were carefully selected to save costs \nwhile maintaining most benefits. Road improvements will be limited to areas where drainage is \nimproved to ensure inter-sector complementarity. Although onsite sanitation systems with septic \ntanks  are  available  in  all  project  municipalities,  poorly  working  septic  tanks  that  discharge \nuntreated wastewater into the drains are causing health risks, particularly by contaminating the \nshallow  groundwater  in  the  Terai.  Therefore,  the  project  municipalities  will  strengthen  the \nmonitoring  of  regular  septic  tank  cleaning,  and  a  sludge  drying  bed  will  be  constructed  at  the \nlandfill  site.  In  Dharan,  an  analysis  concluded  that  the  groundwater  scheme  for  water  supply \naugmentation is technically and financially more advantageous than the surface water scheme. \nA centralized wastewater management system is currently considered unnecessary because (i) \nthe existing onsite systems are generally functioning well in Dharan, with improved monitoring of \nseptic  tank  cleaning  supported  by  the  project;  and  (ii)  there  is  no  concern  about  groundwater \ncontamination due to the depth of groundwater (about 200 meters). \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe public investment to be made under the project, including community infrastructure \nand  programs  to  increase  community  awareness  on  public  health  and  hygiene,  will  have  a \nsubstantial impact on the urban environment and public health improvement. Economic benefits \nconsidered  in  the  economic  analysis  were  (i)  savings  in  business  losses,  road  maintenance \ncosts, and property maintenance costs for the drainage system improvement; (ii) revenue from \nproduction of compost and recyclable materials and reduced health risks and medical expenses \nfor the SWM improvement; (iii) savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time costs for the \nroad  system  improvement;  and  (iv)  non-incremental  water  sales  in  the  form  of  resource  cost \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nsavings,  incremental  water  sales,  and  reduced  medical  expenses  for  the  water  supply  system \nimprovement.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  show  that  all  proposed  subprojects  were \neconomically robust, with economic internal rates of return ranging from 14.6% to 39.5%, higher \nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \n24. \nFinancial  analysis  was  conducted  only  for  the  water  supply  system  improvement  in \nDharan, as other subprojects will not be intended for direct cost recovery. The financial internal \nrate  of  return  was  estimated  at  0.26%,  which  is  nearly  equal  to  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital,  estimated  at  0.30%.The  low  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  the  result  of  a  balance \nbetween financial sustainability and affordability.  However, even under the adverse conditions, \nthe projected cash flow of Dharan municipality will be sufficient to cover O&M expenditure and \ndebt service. For nonrevenue-generating subprojects, the analysis focused on financial capacity \nof  project  municipalities  to  meet  the  recurrent  costs  required  to  operate  and  maintain  the \ndeveloped physical assets in a sustainable manner. An assessment of the financial position of \nthe  municipalities  has  found  these  public  investments  to  be  financially  sustainable  with \nimplementation  of  revenue-enhancement  measures  set  out  in  the  comprehensive  financial \nmanagement improvement plan that each municipality is committed to implement (footnote 8). \n \nC. \n \nAn  assessment  of  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  undertaken  during \n25. \nproject  preparation  indicates  that  DUDBC  and  TDF  have  a  satisfactory  record  from  previous \nprojects and can effectively manage loan and grant proceeds for project implementation. While \nthe  project  municipalities  lack  experience  on  large-scale  projects  financed  by  development \npartners, the financial management risks are mitigated through capacity development technical \nassistance projects (footnote 8). Other risk-mitigation measures include (i) adequate training in \nADB procedures for the municipal staff, and (ii) engagement of a procurement specialist and a \nfinancial  management  specialist  as  consultants  to  assist  the  municipalities.  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners are supporting capacity building of relevant central government agencies \nto  strengthen  supervisory  functions  on  public  procurement.  Transparency  in  procurement, \nfinancing,  and  other matters  will  be  maximized  through  measures  that  include  (i)  development \nby  DUDBC  of  a  project  website,  and  (ii)  local-level  stakeholder  consultations  and  information \ndisclosure. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  municipalities.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  support  provided  for \n27. \nGESI institutional capacity building is expected to enable MPPW to address poverty and social \ninequality issues. The improvements to be made by the project in water supply, drainage, and \nSWM  systems  will  produce  significant  public  health  benefits  to  the  community  in  general, \nincluding the poor. The CDP focuses on municipal poverty pockets, and women, the poor, and \nother  vulnerable  groups  will  benefit  from  small-scale  community  infrastructure,  a  social \nmobilization  program,  and  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development  support.  These  programs \nwill be implemented in a consultative and participatory manner with appropriate representation \nof  women  in  the  poor  settlements.  A  GESI  action  plan  with  specific  targets  for  all  project \nactivities will be implemented to ensure gender equality and social inclusiveness by addressing \nthe different needs of women and vulnerable groups. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\ffrom \n\nSafeguards \n\n(ii)  environmental  pollution \n\nE. \n \n28. \nEnvironmental safeguards. The project is classified as environmental category B. Four \ninitial environmental examinations including environmental management plans were prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws,  and \ndisclosed.  Subprojects  are  not  located  in  or  near  sensitive  or  protected  areas,  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  conclude  that  no  significant  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated  from \nproposed locations, designs, and construction activities. The environmental management plans \nprovide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts are limited and of short duration. The \nnet environmental benefits will be positive and large, including reduced (i) urban flooding from \nimproved  drainage  systems,  and \nimproved  SWM. \nImplementation  arrangements  in  the  PCO  build  on  experience  gained  through  ADB  urban \nprojects,  and  consultant  support  will  enable  the  PIUs  to  manage  environmental  impacts.  The \nPCO  will  provide  environmental  reports  to  ADB  semiannually.  An  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework  was  prepared  to  address  small  components,  which  will  be  defined \nthrough detailed design, following approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n29. \nSocial  safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Three  draft  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  affected  persons  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nand  disclosed.  The  project  requires  minor  land  acquisition  for  construction  of  sanitary  landfills \nand temporary impacts on vendors during construction, with no significant resettlement impacts \nanticipated.  Special  assistance  measures  will  be  made  available  to  vulnerable  groups.  The \nresettlement plans will be implemented by the PIUs and monitored by the PCO, and adequate \nconsultant  inputs  will  be  made  available  to  support  implementation  and  build  capacity  to \nmanaging  resettlement  impacts  and  social  risks.  Considering  the  urban  locations  of  these \nsubprojects, no impacts to indigenous peoples are expected. The draft resettlement framework \nwas  prepared  to  address  small  components,  which  will  be  defined  through  detailed  design, \nfollowing approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF. \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe continued absence of elected \nmayors and frequent transfer of \nexecutive officers in municipalities \ndeputed from the Ministry of Local \nDevelopment may undermine top-\nlevel commitment and delay \ndecision making. \nTax rates, water tariffs, and \nother charges are inadequate \nto sustain operations. \n\nPoor institutional, technical and \nfinancial capacity of municipalities \naffects timely implementation and \n\nStrong stakeholders support, including by local representatives of all major \npolitical parties, was confirmed during project preparation. ADB experience \nshows that active community participation in all aspects of projects can \nensure effective service delivery by insulating development work from the \ncountry\u2019s wider challenges. Political parties are united for local development \nand committed to resolving constraints to project implementation. \n\nTax and tariff campaigns will be implemented by the municipalities to \nincrease the understanding of beneficiaries. Tariff setting will be further \nassessed during detailed design and reviewed by the Town Development \nFund and project coordination office. The municipalities will covenant to \ncollect adequate tariffs or other charges to cover O&M cost. \nADB technical assistance projects help strengthen the institutional capacity \nof municipalities and improve financial management systems, including \nrevenue enhancement. The technical design has taken into account \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nsustainable operation of the \nfacilities. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nmunicipality capacity.
