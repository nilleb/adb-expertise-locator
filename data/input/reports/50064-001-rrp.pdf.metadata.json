THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Georgia  for  the  Batumi  Bypass  Road  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for \nthe Batumi Bypass Road Project and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.1 \n2.  The proposed project will (i) construct a new two-lane bypass road of 14.3 kilometers \n(km) skirting Batumi; and (ii) contract out routine and periodic maintenance work for about 200 \nkm  of  international  and  connecting  secondary  roads,  through  a  performance-based \nmaintenance (PBM) contract. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Country\u2019s strategic location. The Caucasus region forms a land bridge between the \nBlack Sea and the Caspian Sea, and is the shortest transit link from Central Asia to Europe and \nTurkey. The region once served caravans along the historic Silk Road, and today is a major \nconduit for transport of crude oil from Central Asia and the Caucasus to Europe. The East\u2013West \nHighway (EWH) between Azerbaijan and Georgia is already a major route for oil exports from \nAzerbaijan and Central Asian countries, which are exported through the Black Sea ports of Poti \nand Batumi. \n4.  Road network and government sector strategy. Since the mid-2000s, Georgia has \nradically  transformed  its  transport  system  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  through  the \nconstruction of roads, railways, port terminals, and airports. The road network in Georgia totals \nabout 22,000 km, with 6,835 km of international and secondary roads managed by the Roads \nDepartment  of  Georgia  under  the  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  of \nGeorgia (MRDI), and about 15,000 km of local roads managed by district administrations. \nTwo international roads, E60 and E70 of the European network, form Georgia\u2019s EWH portion of \nthe Europe\u2013Asia corridor that transits the Caucasus. It runs north from Sarpi at the border with \nTurkey, serving the Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti; then east to Tbilisi; and then southeast \nto the border with Azerbaijan, a total distance of 412 km. It constitutes a portion of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation program road corridors (Georgia joined the program in \n2016). The EWH carries over 60% of the country\u2019s foreign trade, and is a central element in the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy of developing Georgia as a regional transport and logistics hub. \n5.  Regional transport and logistics hub. The government aims to leverage Georgia\u2019s \ntransit  and  trade  potential  to  boost  private  sector  competitiveness  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.  The  government\u2019s  national  development  strategy  emphasizes  environmental \nsustainability and the integration of Georgia within regional and international transport systems.2 \nThe broad strategic goals are to improve the transport system to link all parts of the country, and \nconnect Georgia\u2019s ports and airports to neighboring countries and beyond; the aim is to make \nGeorgia a regional and logistical hub and business platform, upgrade multimodal infrastructure, \nand ultimately transform Georgia into the preferred gateway between Asia and Europe. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Georgia, Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure.

Since  2004,  development  partners\u2014the  World  Bank, \nEuropean  Investment  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2014have jointly extended their assistance to support rehabilitation and \nupgrading of the EWH, which is essential to regional connectivity. As of 2015, development \npartner assistance and government efforts had upgraded  155 km of the EWH, with some \n113 km under rehabilitation. Development partners have committed to financing 94 km of the \nremaining 144 km. The government aims to complete rehabilitation and upgrading of the EWH \nby 2020. \n7.  ADB assistance. In 2009, ADB approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility \n(MFF) for the Road Corridor Investment Program to assist the government in upgrading two key \nsections of E70 of the EWH.3 The tranche 1 project ($118.8 million, approved in 2009) was to \nconstruct a new 28 km two-lane bypass road skirting Kobuleti. The tranche 2 project ($150 \nmillion, approved in 2010) was to construct a new 14 km two-lane bypass road skirting Batumi. \nAn updated cost estimate prepared in 2011, following completion of the detailed design, far \nexceeded the original cost estimate based on the preliminary design.4 Significant cost overruns \nwere anticipated for both the tranche 1 and 2 projects. In November 2011, the government \nrequested additional financing of $140 million through a tranche 3 project to make up for the \nshortage of financing for the tranche 1 project. However, the government decided to cancel \nconstruction of the Batumi bypass road because of an excessive cost increase and a less-than-\nrobust economic justification; it subsequently canceled the tranche 2 project in November 2011. \n8.  Necessity of bypass road. In 2015, aspiring to upgrade the entire EWH to international \nstandards, the government decided to reassess the Batumi bypass road, and requested that \nADB revive the Batumi bypass road project. Congestion in Batumi city has become intolerable, \nand is aggravated by transit traffic that passes through heavily built up tourist and residential \nareas, and mixes with dense urban traffic. In addition to congestion, the heavy transit traffic also \nposes serious social, environmental, and safety problems for the local population and tourists in \nresort areas. The economic justification for the Batumi bypass road is now much more robust, \nas a result of (i) growing transit traffic from Turkey, (ii) the high cost of urban congestion, \n(iii) serious social and safety costs to the local population, and (iv) a globally stabilized price for \nconstruction materials. The financial viability is not so strong as to attract private sector for \nfinancing and operation of the road. \n9.  Preservation of road assets and sustainability of road networks. Since 2004, the \ngovernment has increased public expenditures for road construction and rehabilitation by about \n13% per year to meet its aspiration to complete the EWH. However, the government\u2019s budget \nallocations for road maintenance have increased by just 6% per year, with routine annual \nmaintenance expenditures for international and secondary roads of about $2,500\u2013$3,000 per \nkm. Development partners have conducted a joint policy dialogue to improve road maintenance \nand  enhance  road  network  sustainability,  with  a  focus  on  (i)  increasing  the  fiscal  budget \nallocation  for  road  maintenance;  (ii)  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  international  and \nsecondary roads in poor condition and thereby reducing the demand for road maintenance \nfunding; and (iii) increasing the efficiency of road maintenance spending. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Georgia for the Road Corridor Investment Program. Manila. \n4  The  updated cost  estimate  increased  substantially due to  (i) alignment changes made  to  avoid  significant \nresettlement impacts, which resulted in additional tunnels and bridges; and (ii) increased global commodity prices, \nwhich led to considerable increases in the cost of construction materials. \n ", "3 \n10.  Unbalanced road network improvement. While international roads have been rapidly \nimproved, secondary and local roads have been relatively neglected. In consequence, while the \nproportion  of  international  roads  that  are  in  good  condition  reached  77%  in  2013,  many \nsecondary and local roads remained in poor (38%) or very poor condition (54%), rendering them \nunmaintainable.  For  this  category  of  roads,  engaging  in  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \nmakes little economic sense; these roads first need to be reconstructed or rehabilitated to a \nmaintainable level. The World Bank concentrated on improving the EWH during 2006\u20132009; \nsince 2012 it has allocated significant resources to rehabilitation of unmaintainable secondary \nroads.  ADB  has  supported  this  effort,  with  a  secondary  road  rehabilitation  project  to  be \nprocessed in 2017.5 These initiatives will reduce overall requirements for road maintenance \nfunding and contribute to more efficient use of maintenance funds. 6 \n11.  Performance-based maintenance. Development partners have guided the government \nto use the resources allocated for road maintenance as efficiently as possible. One of the \nrecommended approaches, the PBM contract, was pilot-tested by the World Bank\u2019s project in \n20127 and was well accepted by the Roads Department as a solution for long-term savings from \nregular and adequate routine maintenance up to the expected levels of service.8 Encouraged by \nthe success of pilot tests and positive feedback from local contractors, the Roads Department \nintends to expand the PBM approach and make the local construction industry familiar with the \nconcept. The proposed project will assist the Roads Department to increase the use of PBM for \nroad maintenance. \n12.  Road safety. The National Traffic Safety Strategy and Action Plan 2009\u20132013 adopted \nby the government in 2009 has mainstreamed road safety audits of new designs and regular \nroad  safety  inspections  of  existing  road  assets,  and  improved  the  Roads  Department's \nimplementation practices and enforcement of traffic laws. The Roads Department road safety \nunit, in conjunction with the patrol police, has carried out road safety audits and inspections of \nplanned  road  rehabilitation  and  construction  activities;  in  combination  with  a  road  safety \ncampaign by nongovernmental organizations, and stricter enforcement of some traffic rules (e.g., \nfront seatbelt use) by the patrol police, this has helped reduce the road accident fatality rate.9 \nThe government adopted the 2nd Road Safety Strategy in 2016 and prepares a yearly action \nplan, financed by the World Bank, which defines road safety as a permanent national priority \nand establish and implement a modern and efficient model for improving road safety in Georgia. \nADB assistance is helping Georgia harmonize road technical regulations with European Union \nstandards and promote road safety, in line with development partners\u2019 efforts. \n13.  Lessons. The implementation of the Kobuleti bypass road showed that a slow, complex \nland acquisition and resettlement process poses a fundamental challenge to timely project \ncompletion. In 2009, expropriation of lands for public purposes and involuntary resettlement \nwere unknown concepts in Georgia, particularly in the Adjara region, because of incomplete \n                                                \n5  The Secondary Road Improvement Project ($80 million). \n6  The Roads Department developed a five-year rolling program for 2016\u20132020 for improvement and preservation of \nsecondary road assets. The key objective is to reduce the existing maintenance backlog and increase the share of \nsecondary roads in good and fair condition. \n7  World Bank. 2012. Project Appraisal Document for a Proposed Credit and a Proposed Loan to Georgia for the \nSecond Secondary and Local Roads Project. Washington D.C.  \n8  PBM contracting for the management and maintenance of road networks is designed to increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness  of  road  maintenance  operations.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Technical  Report  for  Implementation  of \nPerformance Based Contracting (2013) reports that substantial cost savings (up to 50%) can be realized by \nintroducing  performance-based  road  maintenance  contracts  instead  of  traditional  method-based  contracts. \nThe World Bank also found that pilot PBM contracts have started to build local industry capacity in implementation \nand management of contracts, with greater transfer of risks to contractors. \n9  The fatality rate dropped from 16 people per 100,000 in 2006 to 11 people per 100,000 in 2013. \n ", "4 \npost-Soviet Union land reforms. Many land plots remained unregistered; cadastral data were \nincomplete and erroneous; and government agencies (and the courts) had limited experience \nand capacity in handling land expropriation. Grievance and dispute cases were rampant as a \nresult. Experience since 2009 indicates land acquisition and resettlement for the project can be \nexpedited by (i) making contact with important stakeholders early, and briefing them on possible \nscenarios; (ii) tackling difficult, challenging, and unprecedented cases early in the project period; \n(iii)  seeking  high-level  support  through  appropriate  protocols  as  needed;  and  (iv)  allowing \nsufficient time for land acquisition, resettlement, and related consultative processes. \n14.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  has  financed  the  Kobuleti  bypass  road, \ncontiguous to the Batumi bypass road, located in similar hilly terrains, and designed with similar \nengineering features. ADB has also accumulated knowledge and experiences about legal and \ninstitutional mechanisms for land expropriation and relocation of affected people in the project \narea and acquired know-how to expedite due processes. Land acquisition and resettlement \nplans  (LARPs)  under  the  project  were  prepared,  building  on  such  local  knowledge  and \nexperiences, in such a way as to avoid unresolvable grievances and disputes that may block \nproject implementation. ADB\u2019s assistance will be instrumental to completing the project within a \nnormal road construction period without being stalemated in the middle of construction.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact:  improvement of regional connectivity in \nGeorgia  so  that  it  can  play  the  role  of  regional  transport  and  logistics  hub  (footnote  2). \nThe project will have the following outcome: efficiency of road transport along the EWH in \nGeorgia improved. \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: New bypass road skirting Batumi constructed. A new two-lane bypass \nroad of 14.3 km skirting Batumi will start from the Senaki\u2013Poti\u2013Sarpi road; passes through \nmountainous terrain and densely populated villages and ends at the juncture of the existing \nBatumi\u2013Akhaltsikhe road (E691), on an entirely new alignment.  \n17.  Output 2: Routine and periodic maintenance carried out using performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts.  PBM  contracts,  which  will  be  implemented  about  200  km  of \ninternational  and  connecting  secondary  roads,  have  both  output-  and  performance-based \ncomponents and consist of (i) initial repairs, (ii) routine maintenance comprising lump-sum \nmonthly payments per km related to meeting defined operation and maintenance service levels, \n(iii) periodic maintenance (resurfacing), and (iv) emergency maintenance works. \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $315.2 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na regular loan of \u20ac108,190,000 ($114.0 million)10 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 13 years; \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity of \nthe loan is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. ADB will \n                                                \n10 \u20ac0.949037 = $1.00 as of 24 February 2017. \n ", "5 \nfinance expenditures related to the construction of the Batumi bypass road, performance-based \nmaintenance of international and connecting secondary roads, and project management and \ninstitutional support. \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \nItems  Amounta \nA.

The government also requested a loan of $114.0 million from AIIB. It is expected that the \nAIIB loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with AIIB\u2019s sovereign-backed loan pricing; a commitment charge of \n0.25% per year; a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% charged on the loan principal,11 and such \nother terms and conditions to be set forth in the loan agreement between the government and \nAIIB. It is expected that ADB will administer the AIIB loan. AIIB will finance expenditures related \nto  the  construction  of  the  Batumi  bypass  road  (both  civil  works  and  consulting  services). \nThe government will contribute $87.2 million to finance expenditures related to land acquisition \nand resettlement, and also taxes and duties.

MRDI will be the executing agency and the Roads Department, assisted by the Eurasian \nTransport  Corridor Investment  Center  of  MRDI  (ETCIC),  will  be  the  implementing  agency. \nThe International Procurement and Donor Reporting Division of the Roads Department will \nhandle all the project implementation activities under the supervision and guidance of the chair \nor vice-chair of the Roads Department. The International Procurement and Donor Reporting \nDivision comprises technical staff from the Roads Department and, as necessary, external \n                                                \n11 All of these terms are subject to the negotiation and conclusion of the loan agreement between the government \nand AIIB. \n ", "6 \nexperts  (national  and  international).  Financial  management  activities  will  be  outsourced  to \nETCIC. \n22.  Procurement of civil works and related services financed under the project, including the \nADB-administered loan, will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). Consulting services will be required for supervising construction \nand  designing  PBM  contracts.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As the AIIB will \ncofinance the project and ADB will administer the cofinancing, universal procurement will apply, \nincluding for both civil works and consulting services.12 \n23.  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  pursued  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines to facilitate project implementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The project road is a single carriageway two-lane international road with a total road \nwidth of 14 meters (m), including the lanes (7 m), paved shoulder (5 m), and unpaved shoulder \n(2 m). The right of way extends to 64 m (32 m on each side of the centerline), including a buffer \nzone allowance of 50 m (25 m on each side, measured from the edge of carriageway to the \nadjoining  property  boundary  as  required  by  government  regulation).  The  road  design  was \ncarried out in accordance with the Standard on Geometric and Structural Requirements for \nHighways in Georgia, with reference to relevant clauses of the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials standards for the design speed of 100 km per hour, which \nis applicable for the project road\u2019s rugged terrain. The rugged and mountainous terrain requires \nconstruction of five tunnels and 14 bridges, including two major river and two long valley \ncrossings. The total length of the five tunnels is 3.8 km, and their design is consistent with the \nminimum requirements of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.14 \n25.  The project will select contiguous international road links and connecting secondary \nroads of about 200 km in fair to good condition for areawide PBM  contracts. The Roads \nDepartment will define routine maintenance service levels and condition-responsive standards \nfor the application of resurfacing alternatives (including slurry seals, surface treatments, micro-\nsurfacing, functional asphalt concrete overlays, and other appropriate treatments) based on \n(i)  current  maintenance  standards  and  practices;  (ii)  information  collected  from  condition \nsurveys of each road; (iii) analysis of traffic and vehicle overloading data; (iv) analyses of typical \nroad uses and road user needs for each road, including consultations and informal discussions \nwith road users and roadside communities; and (v) affordability, based on analysis of past and \nexpected maintenance expenditures.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic.  An  economic  analysis  for  the  Batumi  bypass  road  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.15 The analysis was based on a comparison of the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios, and covered a period of 25 years, with opening of the facility by 2022. \nTraffic forecast projections included (i) normal traffic in the without-project case, (ii) diverted \ntraffic from the existing road to the bypass section, and (iii) generated traffic. The project\u2019s major \nbenefit will be a reduction in travel time of more than 60% for almost all vehicle types. Savings \nin vehicle operating cost per km (8.5% for cars, 17.3% for light goods vehicles, and 23.8% for \nheavy goods vehicles) and a nearly 50% reduction in traffic accidents are also expected. \nThe highway design and maintenance model 4 was used in projecting benefits.16 \n27.  The economic analysis showed the project to be economically viable, with an estimated \neconomic internal rate of return of 16.1% and an estimated net present value of $62.3 million \nusing a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the economic viability of the project. \nA 20% decrease in benefits would lead to an economic internal rate of return of 12.9%, which \nstill exceeds the threshold of 12%. \n                                                \n14 EUR-Lex Access to European Law.

The project road will be maintained under the government\u2019s normal routine \nmaintenance  program.  The  yearly  allocation  for  routine  maintenance  for  international  and \nsecondary roads of $2,500\u2013$3,000 per km per year will be adequate to maintain project road \nfunction without undue damage. The financial management assessment was conducted as part \nof project preparation. The capacity of the ETCIC was assessed for funds-flow arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements. ETCIC has six professional staff members recruited from \nthe  market  and  professionally  trained  in  financial  management  and  accounting,  and  five \nsupporting specialists. ETCIC's technical capacity is assessed to be satisfactory, ETCIC meets \nADB requirements for financial management, and the financial management risk is moderate. \nC.  Governance \n29.  Since 2003, wide-ranging reforms have been implemented to strengthen public financial \nmanagement and reduce corruption; these have been complemented by measures to improve \npublic service efficiency, including a 50% reduction in the number of civil service employees, \nand higher salaries for retained staff. Georgia\u2019s national procurement system is regulated by the \n1999 Law on State Procurement (and subsequent amendments). Georgia\u2019s public procurement \nframework  is  strong,  based  on  the  country  corruption  profile  prepared  by  ADB.  Public \nprocurement for domestically funded projects is required to use an e-procurement system, \nwhich is closely monitored by the State Procurement Agency.  \n30.  Georgia\u2019s anticorruption regulatory framework is outlined in the 2009 Law of Georgia on \nthe Conflict of Interests and Corruption in Public Service. The Investigative Division of the \nProsecution Service is the key anticorruption body. The Anti-Corruption Interagency Council \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Justice  of  Georgia  is  tasked  with  coordinating  anticorruption  efforts. \nThe council comprises high-level officials along with nongovernment organizations and private \nsector representatives. Georgia adopted its inaugural National Anti-Corruption Strategy and \nAction Plan in 2005. \n31.  ADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines  (2015)17 and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) were explained to and discussed with the government, MRDI, and \nthe Roads Department. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 13). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n32.  The project is expected to help reduce poverty by improving the transport of goods and \npeople and access to services, thereby stimulating economic activities. The project will benefit \nlocal residents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and reducing transport costs \nand travel times. The project is classified as a general intervention, with no direct poverty \nreduction component. It will benefit poor people in the project area by improving transport \nconditions and enabling better access to social services. The civil works contract will require \ncontractors to (i) comply with Georgia\u2019s applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations, and not use child labor; (ii) provide safe working conditions and separate sanitation \nfacilities for male and female workers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and female workers for \nwork  of  equal  value;  (iv)  provide  employment  opportunities  for  women;  and  (v)  carry  out \nHIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 \ncampsites. \n                                                \n17 ADB, Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. 2015.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.18 \n34.  Environment (category A). It is a new alignment that will pass through hilly terrain \ninvolving extensive civil works, including tunnels and bridges, and resulting in a large-scale \noperation. In 2009, during the project preparatory technical assistance stage, the government \nprepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the entire Adjara bypass and \nADB approved it, as required by the ADB Environment Policy 2002. The EIA report was updated \nin 2011 during the detailed design phase, and subsequently revised in 2016, to incorporate \nenvironmental  impacts,  new  legislation,  environmental  management  costs,  new  public \nconsultations, climate change risks, and an assessment of cumulative impacts. The project is \nrated  as  being  at  medium  risk  from  climate  change  impacts  due  to  possible  floods  and \nlandslides at the project location. Where roadways traverse steep slopes, the project design \nmitigates climate risk by incorporating multiple tunnels and high-pillared bridges, rather than \ncutting rock. The updated EIA was disclosed on the ADB website on 2 November 2016. \n35.  The anticipated environmental impacts will occur primarily during construction and result \nfrom the project\u2019s large scale. The road passes through hilly terrain, and in the vicinity of \nsettlements and water courses; soil erosion, noise, dust, vibration, and air quality impacts are \ntherefore likely to be significant. Air quality, noise, and vibration impacts are also expected \nduring road operation. The environmental management plan will include measures to minimize \nanticipated impacts during construction and operation. Prior to construction, the contractors will \ndevelop a site-specific environmental management plan; this will be prepared employing a risk \nassessment approach to select impacts and site-appropriate mitigation measures. \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The total length of the Batumi bypass is 14.3 \nkm. Civil works associated with road construction will entail significant land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR), and some effect on livelihoods.  No LAR impact was identified for the \nstarting 0.6 km of the Batumi bypass road as it constitutes the existing Chakvi\u2013Makhinjauri \ntunnel, for which no structural work is designed other than pavement rehabilitation. For the \nremaining 13.7 km, a total of 963 privately owned land plots will need to be acquired. There are \n769 affected households, totaling 4,051 affected people. Of these, 562 households with 3,024 \npeople are deemed severely affected; 369 households with 2,023 people will require physical \nrelocation; and 276 households are deemed vulnerable. For LAR purposes, the 13.7 km portion \nof the bypass has been split into two sections (7 km and 6.7 km in length). LARPs have (i) been \nproduced for both sections; (ii) approved by ADB, and disclosed on the ADB website; and \n(iii)  are  being  implemented.  The  inclusion  and  entitlements  defined  in  the  LARPs  are  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the project \narea, as defined by the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n38.
