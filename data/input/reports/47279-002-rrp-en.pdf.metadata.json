The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  (i)  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  each  of  the  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and Green \nClimate Fund (GCF), and (ii) a grant to be provided by GCF, all for the Karachi Bus Rapid Transit \nRed  Line  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loans and the grant. \n \n2. \nThe proposed project will help increase the use of quality public transport in Karachi by \ndelivering  the  26.6-kilometer  (km)  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT)  Red  Line  corridor  and  associated \nfacilities, directly benefiting 1.5 million people.1 The project is economically justified by major time \nsavings for BRT passengers; vehicle operating cost savings; and better air quality and reduced \ncarbon  emissions  through  an  innovative  waste-to-fuel  scheme,  which  will  improve  the  public \nhealth and mitigate climate change. It will also make Karachi safer, greener, and more inclusive \nand competitive. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBackground  and  issues.  Karachi  is  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  city  and  its  main  seaport  and \neconomic and financial center. The population of this fast-expanding megacity was estimated at \n15 million in the 2017 census, and 23 million for the metropolitan area. Karachi is one of the most \ndensely  populated  cities  in  the  world  and  is  consistently  ranked  as  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most \nunlivable cities, largely because of traffic congestion and induced air and noise pollution.2 Car and \nmotorcycle ownership is still low but fast-increasing because of a growing middle class. With other \nfactors  such  as  weak  traffic  management  and  inefficient  public  transport,  rapid  motorization \nworsens congestion and pollution.3 Karachi is one of the largest cities in the world without a formal \npublic transport and mass transit system, and until 2015, large investments in flyovers reflected \nthe prioritization of private road transport over public transport.4 \n \n4. \nKarachi\u2019s transport system does not deliver mobility for all and is marked by long commute \ntimes,  the  rise  of  private  and  paratransit  modes,  and  the  decline  of  public  transport  (Table  1). \nServices  are  provided  by  paratransit  vehicles  and  about  4,000  privately  owned  buses,  which \ntogether serve 2.8 million passengers daily. These weakly regulated services are irregular and \nlack  designated  stops  and  customer  standards.  Drivers  compete  and  pull  over  to  pick  up \npassengers  at  will,  or  wait  idling  on the  side  of the  road  until  their  vehicles  are full,  worsening \ncongestion and impairing safety. During peak commute times, it is common for passengers to sit \non the roof or hang from the side of moving vehicles. Vehicles in this informal network tend to be \nold and poorly maintained, leading to increased emissions and higher operating costs. Services \ntend to be costly for the urban poor, as customers must pay for each transfer between modes. \n\n                                                 \n1  About 1.5 million people (10% of Karachi\u2019s population) live within 1 km of a bus rapid transit (BRT) station, including \n\noff-corridor services, and would potentially benefit from the proposed system. \n\n2  The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2018. Global Liveability Report 2018. London. Karachi ranks 137th out of 140 cities. \n3  The project environmental impact assessment measured a 24-hour average concentration of particulate matter of \nfewer than 10 micrometers at 109\u2013141 micrograms per cubic meter in six locations along the BRT corridor. The level \nrecommended by the World Health Organization is 50 micrograms per cubic meter for a 24-hour measuring sample. \n4  In  2015,  the  Government  of  Sindh  province,  supported  by  the  federal  government,  started  reinvesting  in  public \n\ntransport with the BRT Green Line and Orange Line Projects, which are currently still under implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTherefore, 40% of all city trips are still being made on foot. Karachi\u2019s poorest, women, children, \nelderly,  and  people  with  disabilities  would  benefit  from  a  safe,  efficient  and  accessible  public \ntransport system. \n \n\nTable 1: Karachi\u2019s Modal Share for Motorized Trips \n\nCars \n\nPrivate Modes \n\n2018 \n31% \n21% \n\n2018 \n3% \n34% \n\n2008 \n6.3% \n53.5% \n\n2008 \n36.5% \n24.5% \n\nPublic Transport \n(Buses and Minibuses) \n\nMotorcycles \n2018 \n2008 \n53% \n47.3% \n33% \n16.0% \n\nParatransit (Taxis \nand Rickshaws) \n2018 \n2008 \n13% \n9.9% \n12% \n6.0% \n\n \n \nItem \nTotal vehicles in Karachi \nTotal passengers transported \nSources: Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2012.

During 2008\u20132012, the Government of Sindh province, with support \nfrom the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), developed and approved the Karachi \nTransportation Improvement Project, which comprises a transport master plan that proposed a \nmass transit network composed of the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway, two metro rail lines, \nand six BRT lines; the Red, Green, and Yellow lines were prioritized for implementation.5 Building \non  this  initiative,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nprepare this project.6 ADB also approved a $9.7 million project design advance (PDA) loan from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in September 2016.7 \n \n6. \nAlignment  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Government  of \nPakistan\u2019s Vision 2030, Framework for Economic Growth, and National Climate Change Policy. \nIt supports priorities set out in the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020 and in the manifesto \nof  the  newly  elected  federal  government,  which  pledges  to  transform  Karachi  into  a  vibrant \ncompetitive megacity, including the provision of mass transit.8 It aligns with ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nTransport Initiative; country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019; and Strategy 2030 as \nit  contributes  to  the  strategy\u2019s  principles  and  operational  priorities  such  as  promoting  \u201clivable \ncities\u201d,9  \u201caccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality\u201d,  \u201ctackling  climate  change  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability\u201d, and supporting the \u201cuse of innovative technologies\u201d.10 Coordination \nwith development partners such as AFD, AIIB, GCF, JICA, the World Bank and the Aga Khan \nTrust for Culture has been ensured. \n                                                 \n5  JICA. 2012.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe project design incorporates lessons learned from past assistance, notably the need \n7. \nfor  (i)  strong  political  support  and  consensus;  (ii)  a  robust  governance  structure;  (iii)  thorough \nproject preparation and readiness prior to proceeding with project approval; (iv) realistic project \nimplementation  timeline;  and  (v)  sound  construction  supervision  and  contract  management.11 \nPrivate  sector  participation  is  being  supported  for  BRT  operations  (para.  23)  but  not  for \nconstruction under a public\u2013private partnership arrangement; globally, few mass transit systems \nrecover capital costs through revenue alone, as fares must be affordable.12 \n \n8. \n\nValue added by ADB assistance (para. 5): \n(i) \n\nInstitutional  development.  ADB  supported  the  establishment  and  assists  in \nbuilding  the  capacity  of  a  special  purpose  vehicle  called  TransKarachi, \nincorporated  in  October  2018.13  The  Sindh  Mass  Transit  Authority  (SMTA)  is \nresponsible  for  regulating,  planning,  and  funding  urban  mobility  for  all  cities  in \nSindh  province.  TransKarachi  will  implement  the  project  and  manage  service \ncontracts for BRT operations in Karachi. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(ii)  Waste-to-fuel  innovation.  ADB  promotes  environmental  sustainability  through \nthe production and use of biomethane from cattle waste to fuel the BRT fleet of \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) hybrid buses. \nUniversal  accessibility  and  nonmotorized  transport.  ADB  ensures  that  the \nproject design includes (a) a bicycle-sharing system, bicycle lanes, and other non-\nmotorized transport vehicles for first and last mile connectivity; and (b) universal \naccessibility and other gender-friendly features in BRT stations and buses. \nOperations plan and financial sustainability. ADB promotes a third-generation \nBRT system using a direct service operational model, which allows BRT vehicles \nto travel along the BRT corridor in the busiest parts of the city and off-corridor in \nless congested areas. A modern fare system using smart cards to enable distance-\nbased  fares  will  facilitate  this  approach,  expanding  the  system\u2019s  reach  and \ncapacity,  reducing  passenger  transfers,  and  increasing  ridership  and  financial \nsustainability. The project is designed primarily to limit operational subsidies. \nBus  industry  transition.  ADB  emphasizes  engagement  with  the  existing  bus \nindustry and establishes a negotiation process that enables existing operators to \nparticipate in the new BRT system. The project design includes a fleet scrapping \nprogram and compensation mechanism for nonparticipating operators. \nClimate  change.  ADB  assessed  the  project\u2019s  vulnerability  to  climate  change \nimpacts and addresses climate risks in the project\u2019s design. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: quality of life in Karachi improved. The \n\n \nB. \n \n9. \nproject will have the following outcome: use of quality public transport in Karachi increased.14 \n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2005.

From 2004 to 2008, ADB prepared this investment program for Karachi, which included \nBRT  corridors.  The  Program  was  finally  dropped  in  2009  because  of  disagreement  between  the  provincial \ngovernment and the municipality.

The Red \nLine  corridor  will  be  restructured  over  its  entire  width  (facade-to-facade),  including  (i)  the  BRT \ninfrastructure comprising 29 stations and dedicated lanes built mainly at grade in the median; (ii) \nthe mixed-traffic roadway with up to six lanes in each direction; (iii) the nonmotorized transport \ninfrastructure  along  the  corridor  comprising  bicycle  lanes,  improved  sidewalks,  and  energy-\nefficient  street  lights;  (iv)  on-street  parking  and  landscaped  green  areas  added  in  various \nlocations; and (v) improved drainage to climate-proof the corridor. The BRT infrastructure will be \ncompleted  with  two  depots,  one  underground  staging  facility,  an  extension  of  the  BRT  control \ncenter,  and  off-corridor  bus  stops.  The  common  corridor  section  will  be  remodeled  to  create \nnotably a 1-km mall reserved only for pedestrians and BRT buses. Facades of selected historical \nbuildings  along  the  common  corridor  will  be  restored,  and  utilities  buried,  providing  a  new \nlandmark and quality public space for the city. \n \n11. \nOutput 2: BRT operations established. This will be done through (i) capacity building of \nthe  SMTA  and  TransKarachi;  (ii)  the  design  of  the  BRT  business  model  and  subsidy-free \noperations;  (iii) a  bus  industry  transition  program,  comprising  a  fleet  scrapping  program  and \ncompensation mechanism; (iv) effective project communication; and (v) the delivery of the BRT \nfleet, feeder e-vehicles, intelligent transport systems (including a distance-based fare system, a \nbicycle sharing system and others), and a biogas plant.16 \n \nD. \n \n12. \nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).17 \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $572  million  (Table  2).

The  GCF  grant  will  finance  climate  change \nadaptation measures (innovative drainage features such as bioswales), post-project emissions\u2019 \nmonitoring activities and feeder e-vehicles. The GCF loan will finance the biogas plant and the \nincremental  cost  for  the  transition  from  basic  diesel  bus  technology  to  biomethane-hybrid  bus \ntechnology. ADB, AIIB, and AFD will jointly finance civil works and equipment costs (excluding \ncomponents financed exclusively by GCF) on a cost-sharing basis, and related contingencies and \nfinancial  charges  during  implementation.  ADB  will  solely  finance  consulting  services,  the  bus \nindustry  transition  program,  and  TransKarachi\u2019s  3-year  operating  costs.  The  government  will \nfinance  expenditures  related  to taxes  and  duties,  relocation  of  utilities,  and  environmental  and \nsocial impact (resettlement) mitigation measures.

The BRT is at grade for 88% of its length, allowing 80 km of off-corridor service \nroutes to enter the dedicated infrastructure. Only six underpasses with a total length of 2.43 km, \nand one elevated rotary of 0.85 km in length are planned for BRT to allow full segregation and \nmaximum commercial speed at critical junctions. The mixed-traffic roadway has (i) up to 6 lanes, \nincluding service roads, in each direction in wider sections, and (ii) 16 grade-separated structures, \nincluding 3 underpasses of a total length of 1 km, 8 elevated U-turns of a total length of 3.89 km, \nand 5 flyovers of a total length of 2.09 km, to allow for all traffic movement while accommodating \nBRT at grade. Overall, the project comprises road works of a total length of 31.8 km, including 23 \ngrade-separated structures of a total length of 10.3 km. A climate risk vulnerability assessment \nhas also led to innovative drainage measures to climate-proof the BRT corridor from floods.27 \n \nThe BRT system was planned using a detailed methodology, including the inventory and \n23. \nanalysis of existing services to determine current service capacity and existing demand, and a \npurpose-built  demand  model.  Based  on  the  results  of  this  analysis,  an  optimized  routing  and \nnetwork  plan  was  developed  to  ensure  maximum  ridership  and  financial  sustainability  of  the \nsystem without the need for operational subsidies. The institutional structure has been improved \nby the establishment of the SMTA and TransKarachi, which will manage and control the overall \nquality of the BRT system\u2019s operations. System quality will be enhanced by maximizing the use \nof  private  sector  contracts  for  system  operations.  TransKarachi  will  oversee  private  sector \n\n                                                 \n26 The engineering, procurement, and construction management consultant team has conducted various surveys on \nthe corridor\u2019s topography, hydrology, geology, and utilities. Based on the results of these surveys, the operational \ndesign and business model consultant team revisited the preliminary engineering design. ADB and the Sindh Mass \nTransit  Authority  have  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  such  design  and  instructed  the  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction  management  consultant  team  to  proceeded  with  the  detailed  engineering  design,  which  has  been \ncompleted in May 2019. \n\n27 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\ncontracts of companies for (i) bus operations; (ii) system control, encompassing the fare system, \nstation services, and bicycle-sharing system; (iii) the financial clearinghouse; and (iv) commercial \nservices such as property management and advertising. \n \nA cost\u2013benefit analysis of different vehicle and fuel technologies led to the choice of CNG \n24. \nhybrid buses for the BRT fleet, with an estimated reduction of 77,979 metric tons of carbon dioxide \nemissions per year.28 This result will be further improved by the introduction of a waste-to-fuel \nscheme,  which  will  also  significantly  improve  the  system\u2019s  operational  and  financial  results  by \nlowering the cost at entry for CNG fuel. Locally produced biomethane from cattle waste is indeed \nexpected  to  be  five  to  eight  times  cheaper  than  market-price  imported  CNG,  which  led  to  the \ninclusion of the biogas plant as a capital subsidy under the GCF loan. \n \nThe waste-to-fuel scheme will also have a significant environmental benefit, as more than \n25. \n7,000 tons of cattle waste is currently produced daily at farms in Karachi\u2019s Cattle Colony, and this \nwaste is then discarded into Karachi Bay, with highly negative impact both to the local ecology \nand the global environment. The project will eliminate current methane emissions, as the waste \nwill be converted into biomethane, which will be the fuel source for the BRT vehicles.   \n \nB. \n \nThe project aims to provide a high-frequency transit service, replacing informal modes of \n26. \ntransport traveling in mixed traffic, with fuel-efficient BRT vehicles traveling in segregated lanes \nat  high  speeds.  In  the  first  year  of  BRT  operations,  demand  is  expected  to  reach  320,000 \npassengers per day. By 2021, vehicle operating cost savings are expected to reach $23 million \nper year, while time savings for BRT passengers and the remaining mixed traffic will reach $54 \nmillion  per  year.  Additional  benefits from  reduced fatalities  and greenhouse gas  emissions  will \nreach $16.4 million per year. The economic analysis yielded an economic internal rate of return \nof  20%,  demonstrating  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.29  To  ensure  a  robust  result,  three \nsensitivity tests were conducted for the following scenarios: (i) 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) 20% \nreduction in passenger ridership, and (iii) 2-year delay in system opening. All scenarios meet the \n9% minimum economic internal rate of return required for an ADB-financed project. \n \nThe BRT operational plan was designed to make sure that revenue generated from the \n27. \nsystem will cover operation and maintenance costs. The BRT system generates revenue from (i) \ndistance-based fares ranging from PRs15 to PRs55, and averaging PRs35; (ii) advertising; and \n(iii) rent on concession shops in stations and depots. In the absence of a cost recovery tariff, a \nconventional  financial  evaluation  based  on  cash  flow  analysis  leading  to  the  computation  of  a \nfinancial internal rate of return was not considered appropriate.30 Instead, a financial model was \ndeveloped, and an analysis of the net operating cash flow was conducted to confirm that revenues \nwill cover operating costs in various scenarios. The results showed that using locally produced \nbiofuel significantly improves the system\u2019s financial performance. In most scenarios, the future \nfinancial position of TransKarachi confirms solid net cash flows and its financial capacity to cover \nrecurrent costs to sustain the facilities developed under the project. \n \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2018.

Accordingly, TransKarachi will not need to \nrepay the loan from the BRT system\u2019s operational revenue. Therefore, the terms and conditions of the ADB, AFD, \nAIIB, and GCF loans will not impact this financial analysis. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nC. \n \n28. \nThe project financial management and procurement risk assessments found substantial \npre-mitigation  risks  from  the  newly  established  implementing  agency.31  The  SMTA  and  the \nGovernment of Sindh\u2019s Transport and Mass Transit Department agreed on an action plan to build \na  robust  financial  management  system  and  procurement  capacity  within  TransKarachi  by \nengaging  consultants  to  provide  support  during  project  implementation.  The  assessed  risk  is \nbased  on  TransKarachi\u2019s  (i)  internal  control  environment,  (ii)  experience  in  implementing \ndevelopment projects, (iii) supervisory procedures, and (iv) financial capability. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Sindh, the SMTA, and TransKarachi. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17).  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  benefit  Karachi\u2019s  estimated  population  of  15  million  (75%  of  whom  are \n30. \npoor or low income) through increased access to safe, reliable, and affordable public transport. \nAbout 320,000 passengers are expected to use BRT daily, with the share of female passengers \nreaching 15% in 2022 (first year of operation) and increasing to 20% by the end of 2023 (last year \nof  project  implementation).  The  low  share  of  female  passengers  in  public  transport  is  mainly \nbecause of the risk of harassment that women face in overcrowded public buses. Consequently, \nmost women prefer to walk 2 km per day on average or are forced to use more expensive private \ntransportation, affecting their disposable income. The project will establish universal access and \nsafety features for women, children, and people with disabilities in (i) all 29 BRT stations, including \nproper lighting and monitoring through closed-circuit television cameras; and (ii) buses, including \nsegregated areas for women and staff trained to deal with harassment incidents. The project is \nclassified effective gender mainstreaming and will encourage women\u2019s participation by ensuring \nthat 15% of BRT operations employees and TransKarachi staff are women. Overall, the project \nis  expected  to  generate  2,130  jobs  directly  through  BRT  operations,  including  1,424  jobs  for \nstation  services  such  as  ticketing,  security,  and  cleaning;  615  jobs  in  bus  operations  such  as \ndriving, conducting, and mechanics; and 81 staff jobs in TransKarachi.32 \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category A). The SMTA prepared (i) an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for the 24.2-km main corridor; (ii) a supplementary environmental impact assessment for \nthe 2.4 km common corridor section; and (iii) environmental management plans; all in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  will  be \ncompleted  at  a  later  stage,  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, for the biogas plant whose site has yet to be finalized. During the construction phase, \nanticipated  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  are  related  to  traffic  disruptions  and \naccess to properties, relocation of utilities, tree cutting, air quality, community health and safety, \n                                                 \n31 Financial Management Assessment Report; and Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n32 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy;  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB.

Adequate mitigation measures have been \nincorporated  into  the  project  design  and  will  be  implemented  through  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  which  include  a  capacity  building  program  for  TransKarachi  staff  and \ncontractors  during  the  procurement  and  construction  stages.  During  the  operation  phase,  the \nproject  is  expected  to  have  mostly  positive  impacts,  specifically  on  the  acoustic  environment, \nbecause of the modal shift. A computer noise model notably shows that traffic noise levels would \nbe  substantially  reduced  (by  almost  20  A-weighted  decibels)  along  the  1-km  mall  reserved for \npedestrians  and  BRT  buses,  and  would  remain  the  same  along  other  sections  of  the  corridor \nwhere  BRT  buses  will  run  in  parallel  with  mixed  vehicular  traffic.34  In  addition,  and  beside  its \noverall positive carbon footprint (para. 24 and 25), the project is expected to have a positive impact \non the air quality along the corridor since BRT buses will be operating primarily on biomethane. \nThe  project  complies  with  public  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  Consultations  with \nstakeholders were conducted for the main and common corridors from December 2017 to March \n2019. Public hearings, attended by more than 100 stakeholders, were conducted in mid-October \n2018 for the main corridor. A draft consolidated EIA report was disclosed on the ADB website on \n28 February 2019. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Civil  works  for  the  project\u2019s  24.2  km  main \ncorridor  and  2.4  km  common  corridor  section  will  not  involve  acquisition  of  any  private  land. \nHowever, it will displace 774 persons and entities from the main corridor, including (i) 223 owners \nof small shops that will lose structure extensions; (ii) 77 public and private organizations that need \nto shift their minor structures and equipment within their premises; and (iii) 275 owners and 199 \nworkers from micro businesses occupying the existing right-of-way. Temporary and permanent \nalternative locations for vending near the BRT corridor are being explored by the project to assist \nthe affected micro businesses. Permanent formal vending spaces included in the project design \nwill  also  be  open  to  interested  business  owners  including  those  affected  by  the  project.  The \napproved draft resettlement plan for the main corridor has been updated following the detailed \ndesign. An additional 139 vendors will be displaced from the common corridor section for which \na draft resettlement plan has been prepared in consultation with the affected persons and relevant \nagencies. The proposed underground staging facility will affect the sports ground near Numaish \nthat is leased by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation to Karachi Goan Association. Impact from the \nbiogas plant is still to be confirmed once the site has been finalized. TransKarachi will update and \nimplement the resettlement plans on behalf of the SMTA. \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  in  Karachi  where  no  indigenous \npeoples, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, reside. The project will not affect \nany indigenous communities, and no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                 \n34  A-weighted decibels, abbreviated dBA, are an expression of the relative loudness of sounds in the air as perceived \nby the human ear. In the A-weighted system, the decibel values of sounds at low frequencies are reduced, compared \nwith unweighted decibels, in which no correction is made for audio frequency. This correction is made because the \nhuman ear is less sensitive at low audio frequencies, especially below 1000 Hertz, than at high audio frequencies. \n\n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPublic transport users do not \nuse BRT at projected levels. \n\nVested interests of existing \npublic transport operators, \nshopkeepers, and others along \nthe BRT corridor try to \nundermine the project during \nimplementation. \n\nDelayed operationalization of \nthe SMTA and TransKarachi \nCompany fails to provide the \nnecessary critical mass to \nimplement the project and \ncapacity building. \n\nTransKarachi lacks staff with \nexperience in procurement \nusing ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines, to efficiently carry \nout procurement activities. \nIncomplete and inaccurate \nfinancial reporting creates \nimplementation delays. \n\nThe security situation \ndeteriorates and impairs \nproject implementation and \nBRT operations. \n\nMitigation Measures \nProject design advance consultants estimated demand using detailed surveys and \na sophisticated model, factoring in the use of an innovative operations plan and \ncommunication strategy that will likely boost ridership. \nExisting operators. Consultations with existing bus operators\u2019 federations were \nheld by operations design and business model consultants to inform operators about \nthe project, and skilled negotiators were recruited to further discuss and develop a \nbusiness plan to include existing operators as much as possible in BRT operations. \nDedicated cost and consultancy support are built into the project design to facilitate \nthe bus industry transition through negotiations, fleet renovation, and capacity \nbuilding to operate the BRT. The project design also includes a fleet scrapping plan \nand compensation mechanism for nonparticipating existing operators. \n \nShopkeepers\u2019 and traders\u2019 associations. The Government of Sindh province, \nsupported by the PMCCB communication team and ADB project team, engaged \nwith traders\u2019 associations and other organizations affected by the BRT corridor to \npresent the project design, consider their concerns, and promote buy-in and \nownership, so that these groups do not oppose the project or ask to change the \nproject design during implementation. \nThe SMTA was established in September 2016 and has been in operation since \nthen, while TransKarachi was incorporated as a Section 42 (nonprofit) public \ncompany in October 2018. The Government of Sindh, as part of its commitment, \nhas approved an annual allocation for SMTA operations. ADB will finance \nTransKarachi\u2019s operational expenditure for 3 years. Organizational charts and job \ndescriptions for key staff for both organizations were developed by the PMCCB \nconsultant, who will also provide support for staff recruitment and capacity building. \nADB\u2019s prior review will be required for procurement of all contracts. ADB will provide \nformal training in ADB procurement and consulting service procedures and \npractices. PMCCB consultants will also provide training on this aspect and will \ndevelop a procurement manual and a contract management manual for \nTransKarachi procurement staff. ADB will closely monitor compliance. \nTransKarachi will adopt the financial management manual developed by ADB and \nthe cost control accounting software developed by the PMCCB consultant in \nestablishing a proper financial management system. Training by ADB will further \nenhance TransKarachi\u2019s staff capacity. \nThe Government of Sindh province has committed to provide security to the project \nsite through its Home Affairs Department and local law enforcement agencies. \nBidders will be instructed to include provisions for staff security. The project design \nincludes measures such as metal detectors installed in all BRT stations and the \npresence of security agents in all BRT vehicles. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; BRT = bus rapid transit; PMCCB = project management, coordination, and capacity \nbuilding; SMTA = Sindh Mass Transit Authority. \nSource: ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan,  the  Government  of  Sindh,  the  SMTA,  and  TransKarachi \n36. \nhave assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, \nincluding \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n37. \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan,  the  Government  of  Sindh,  the  SMTA,  and  TransKarachi \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan \nagreement and draft project agreement. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$235,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Karachi  Bus  Rapid  Transit  Red  Line \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  22  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n11 June 2019\n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n \nUnexpected \ndeterioration of \nthe security \nsituation delays \nproject \nimplementation. \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na\u2013c.

Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020. Karachi. \nb  Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. 2016. The BRT Standard. New York. The BRT Standard is an \nevaluation tool for BRT corridors based on international best practices. It is also the centerpiece of a global effort by \nleaders in BRT design to establish a common definition of BRT and to ensure that BRT corridors more uniformly \ndeliver world-class passenger experiences, significant economic benefits, and positive environmental impacts. The \nstandard functions as a planning tool, scoring system, and means of achieving a common definition of BRT. \n\nc  Examples of gender-inclusive design features include (i) separate queuing spaces for men and women; (ii) marked \npriority seating in waiting areas for the elderly, pregnant women, and PWDs; (iii) separate restrooms for men and \nwomen; and (iv) well-lit and unobstructed floor design with visible and operational CCTVs to discourage any form of \nharassment.  Specific  gender-inclusive  design  features  and  operational  safety  features  in  stations  and  buses  are \nprovided in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and \nrecommendation of the President). \n\nd  The 2018 baseline for the main corridor: (i) deteriorated and encroached sidewalks; (ii) various number of mixed-\ntraffic lanes, from three to six lanes per direction, encroached by illegally parked vehicles that limit capacity to two or \nthree  effective  lanes  per  direction;  and  (iii)  wide  unused  roadway  median.  Because  of  the  retrofitting of  the  BRT \ninfrastructure in the median and full remodeling of the corridor over its entire width, mixed-traffic lanes will be shifted \nto  the  sides  and  their  number  reduced,  while  keeping  the  same  effective  capacity  by  removing  illegally  parked \nvehicles and encroachments. Bicycle lanes will be added on both sides, sidewalks will be rebuilt and improved, green \nareas, on-street parking and small markets for displaced informal vendors will be added in various locations wherever \nspace permits, and streetlights will be improved through the introduction of energy-efficient LED lighting. \n\ne  Any CNG quantity required to fuel the BRT fleet that could not be provided through the proposed biogas plant will be \n\npurchased by TransKarachi on the market, where it is in widespread use. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=47279-002-3 \n\nLoan Agreement: ADB \n\nLoan Agreement: Green Climate Fund \n\nGrant Agreement: Green Climate Fund \n\nProject Agreement \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Transport \n\nProject Administration Manual \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\nCountry Economic Indicators \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nClimate Change Assessment \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: Supplementary Report  \n\nResettlement Plan \n\nResettlement Plan: Supplementary Report  \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nFinancial Management Assessment Report \n\nProcurement Risk Assessment Report \n\n \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 May 2019) \n", "Currency unit \nPRe1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n$0.0071 \n", "$1.00  =  PRs141.777 \n", "ADB \nAFD \nAIIB \nBRT \nCNG \nGCF \nJICA \nkm \nPAM \nPDA \nSMTA \nTA \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n\u2013  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \n\u2013  bus rapid transit \n\u2013  compressed natural gas \n\u2013  Green Climate Fund \n\u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013  kilometer \n\u2013  project administration manual \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "project design advance \nSindh Mass Transit Authority  \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTE \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Shixin Chen, Operations 1 \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General  Werner Liepach, Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \n", "Yong Ye, Urban Development and Water Division, CWRD \n \nDavid Margonsztern, Principal Urban Development Specialist (Transport), \n", "Team members  Nicolas Dei Castelli, Urban Development Specialist (Transport), CWRD \n \n \n \n", "Nurlan Djenchuraev, Senior Environment Specialist, CWRD \nLiza Jane Domingo, Project Analyst, CWRD \nMinhong Fan, Senior Procurement Specialist, Procurement, Portfolio and \n", "Financial Management Department \n", "Leah Jean Luna, Senior Operations Assistant, CWRD \nJose Tiburcio Nicolas, Senior Social Development Specialist (Safeguards), \n", "CWRD \n", "CWRD \n", "Patricia Rhee, Principal Counsel, Office of the General Counsel \nNathan Rive, Climate Change Specialist, CWRD \nMary Alice Rosero, Social Development Specialist (Gender and \n", "Mian Shaukat Shafi, Senior Project Officer, Pakistan Resident Mission \n", "Development), CWRD \n", "(PRM), CWRD \n", "Peer reviewer \n", "Syed Umar Ali Shah, Senior Project Officer, PRM, CWRD \nLloyd Wright, Senior Urban Development Specialist (Transport), CWRD \nSteven Lewis-Workman, Senior Transport Specialist, Sustainable \n", "Development and Climate Change Department \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn preparing any country program or strategy, financing any project, or by making any designation \nof  or  reference  to  a  particular  territory  or  geographic  area  in  this  document,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank does not intend to make any judgments as to the legal or other status of any \nterritory or area. \n", " \n"]}
