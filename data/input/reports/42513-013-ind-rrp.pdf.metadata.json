The  report  also  describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Karnataka State Road Sector, and \nif  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  Karnataka  State  Highway  Improvement  Project  will  upgrade  about  615  kilometers \n2. \n(km)  of  state  highways  in  the  state  of  Karnataka  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Public \nWorks  Department  (PWD)  of  the  Government  of  Karnataka  (GOK)  to  develop,  operate,  and \nmaintain  the  state  road  network.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  supervise  the \nimplementation of civil works and support the establishment and operation of the Planning and \nRoad  Asset  Management  Centre  (PRAMC)  of  the  PWD.  Associated  TA  will  be  provided  to \nsupport  and  strengthen  the  PWD\u2019s  capacity  in  asset  management,  road  safety,  and  private \nsector participation. Road improvement works will include the upgrading of existing roads to two \nlanes;  green-field  construction  of  bypasses;  strengthening  of  culverts  and  bridges;  and \nconstructing new bridges, rail overbridges, and cross-draining structures. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nUnder  the  India  country  partnership  strategy  (2009\u20132012), 2   the  Asian  Development \n3. \nBank (ADB) supports all levels of the road sector development as a core infrastructure operation \nto facilitate sustainable economic growth. The project is consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy\u2019s  strategic  objectives  and  was  included  in  the  India  country  operations  business  plan \n(2011). Given the high level of project readiness, the processing of the project has been brought \nforward from 2011 to 2010.  \n \n4. \nIn  India,  road  transport  accounts  for  68%  of  freight  movement  and  87%  of  passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the secondary system are unable to cope with the rapid traffic \ngrowth;  freight  traffic  on  roads  has  increased by  about  12%  per  year and  passenger  traffic  by \nabout 8% per year over the past decade. These trends have led to congestion, deterioration of \nroads,  and  increases  in  transport  costs.  State  highways  (the  secondary  road  system  in  India) \nlink  national  highways  with  district  headquarters  and  important  towns.  The  secondary  system \ncomprises about 13% of the road network and carries about 40% of traffic.  \n \n5. \nThe road network in Karnataka comprises 3,987 km of national highways, 22,078 km of \nstate highways, 50,037 km of major district roads, and 147,212 km of village roads. There is an \nincreasing  demand  for  road  transport  leading  to  capacity  constraints  on  the  existing  road \nnetwork.  Specifically,  only  27%  of  state  highways  and  21%  of  major  district  roads  are \nconsidered to be in good condition, while 14% of state highways and 20% of major district roads \nare  in  poor  condition.  More  than  13,000  km  of  state  highways  are  already  experiencing \ncongestion of various degree, with more than 7,800 km operating at the capacity limit. \n \n6. \nApart  from  the  need  to  improve  road  infrastructure,  the  PWD,  which  is  in  charge  of \noverall road sector development and management, needs to build sustainable capacity in road \n\n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n\n\f 2 \n\nplanning  and  asset  management.  Specifically,  it  needs  to  (i)  establish  objective,  data-driven \nprocesses to plan the road network and road maintenance; (ii) systematically incorporate road \nsafety  measures  into  the  life  cycle  of  state  roads;  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  to  procure  and \nimplement  road  projects  with  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  strengthen  capacity  for  the \neffective  operation,  maintenance,  and  protection  of  existing  road  assets;  and  (v)  integrate \nenvironmental and social safeguards into road design, project implementation, and operation of \nthe road network. \n \nIn  2009,  responding  to  the  urgent  need  to  improve  infrastructure  and  strengthen \n7. \ninstitutions, the GOK adopted a road sector policy that identified several priority areas, including \nimproving  the  state\u2019s  core  road  network  along  with  restructuring,  capacity  building,  and \ninstitutional  strengthening. \nInstitutional  Development  and \nStrengthening  Action  Plan  (IDSAP).  The  project  and  its  associated  TA  will  assist  GOK  to \nimprove state core road network and implement the IDSAP.  \n\nIn  2010,  GOK  adopted  an \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe long-term impact of the project will be accelerated economic growth in the state of \nKarnataka.  The  immediate  project  outcome  will  be  more  efficient  and  sustainable  transport \noperations on the state highway network. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nSpecific  outputs  will  include:  (i)  upgrading  of  about  615  km  of  priority  state  highways;  \n(ii)  the  transformation  of  road  sector  planning,  programming,  and  policy  formulation  into  an \nobjective,  data-driven,  and  sustainable  process;  (iii)  safer  roads;  and  (iv)  stronger  capacity  at \nthe PWD for the operation, maintenance, and protection of road assets.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Roads \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nRoad or Corridor Name \nMagadi\u2013NH 48\u2013Dobbespet (NH-4)\u2013Koratagere \nPavagada\u2013 Andhra Pradesh Border \nGubbi\u2013Pura\u2013Beeragonahalli (NH-48)\u2013Kowdley\u2013Mandya \nJagalur\u2013NH\u201313\u2013Molkalmur\u2013SH 19 \nPadubidri\u2013Belmane\u2013Karkala \nDavanagere\u2013Santhebennur\u2013Channagiri\u2013Ajjampura\u2013Birur \nShelavadi\u2013Gadag\u2013Mundaragi \nMudgal\u2013Tavaragere\u2013Kanakagiri\u2013Gangawathi \nSoundatti\u2013Ramdurg\u2013Badami\u2013Pattadakal\u2013Kamatagi \n\nTotal Length \n(kilometer) \n68.20 \n23.21 \n108.62 \n14.38 \n27.80 \n105.63 \n63.44 \n74.20 \n130.13 \n615.61 \n\nTotal\n\nNH=national highway; SH=state highway \nSource: Project implementation unit, Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project. \n\n \nThe project will add value to the current efforts of GOK to secure sustainable financing \n10. \nfor  the  road  sector  through  the  establishment  of  the  State  Road  Fund.  It  will  establish  robust \nmechanisms  to  ensure  the  most  effective  use  of  funds  in  the  road  sector.  Specifically,  the \nproject  will  provide  (i)  consulting  services,  tools    and  equipment  to  support  establishment  and \noperation of PRAMC and mainstream objective, data driven practices in the areas of strategic \nroad policy and planning, programming, and road safety; (ii) equipment to improve the efficiency \nand quality of asset management; and (iii) equipment to implement traffic incident management \nsystems on two pilot corridors, and to support the implementation of a pilot accident black spot \n\n\fprogram.3  To  ensure  the  sustainability  and  quality  of  PRAMC  operations,  consulting  services \nwill  be  provided  in  three  phases:  (i)  preparatory  (6  months),  including  developing  business \nprocesses,  operations  manuals,  and  supply  and  installation  of  systems  and  tools  required  for \nPRAMC  operations;  (ii)  operational  (2  years),  working  with  PRAMC  staff  on  day-to-day \noperations  and  conducting  training  in  apprenticeship  mode;  and  (iii)  standby  (6  months), \nincluding  supporting  PRAMC  on  as-needed  basis,  once  operations  are  fully  taken  over  by  its \nstaff.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n11. \nThe overall project cost is estimated to be about $462.75 million.

The \nproject implementation unit (PIU) will be a part of the PWD and will be the implementing agency \nfor the project. The chief project officer assisted by the project director (chief engineer level) will \nbe  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of  the  project.  The  PIU  will  report  on  high-level \nmatters to the secretary and principal secretary, PWD. The project director has been appointed \nas the highway authority by the GOK under the Karnataka State Highway Act and has adequate \ndecision-making power to implement all preconstruction activities. The PIU has four field offices \nnear  the  project  roads,  to  manage  the  contracts  for  civil  work  and  construction  supervision. \nEach field office is headed by an executive engineer managing three or four subdivision offices. \nCivil works will be supervised by a firm of construction supervision consultants to be recruited \nthrough international competitive bidding with quality- and cost-based selection (using a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 75:25). The PIU will use the services of the project coordination consultant financed \nby the GOK resources to prepare designs, bidding documents, and support other project-related \nactivities.  \n \n15. \nthe project administration manual (PAM).4  \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nCapacity  development  TA  in  the  amount  of  $1,500,000  for  Capacity  Building  for \n16. \nKarnataka State Road Sector will support the implementation of GOK\u2019s IDSAP. The major focus \nof the TA will be on strengthening the asset management and road safety management capacity \nof  the  PWD,  including  advisory  support  to  enable  the  PWD  to  (i)  carry  out  the  effective \noperation, maintenance, and protection of existing roads; (ii) incorporate road safety measures \ninto the lifecycle of state roads in a sustainable manner; (iii) develop its capacity to procure and \nimplement  road  projects  through  private  sector  participation  schemes;  and  (iv)  integrate \nenvironmental and social safeguards into road design, project implementation, and operation of \nthe road network. \n \n17. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). It will be carried out by an international consulting firm with expertise in \ntransport  planning,  asset  management,  road  safety  and  traffic  management,  institutional \nstrengthening  of  transport  sector  agencies,  and  private  sector  participation.

All road designs have \nbeen completed, the economic evaluation has been updated, applications for obtaining statutory \nenvironmental  clearances  from  state  and  central  authorities  have  been  submitted  (clearances \nfor  some  roads  have  already  been  received),  and  preconstruction  activities  have  started. \nDetailed  designs  have  incorporated  the  recommendations  of  a  road  safety  expert  and  will  be \nsubjected to road safety audits by the construction supervision consultant, with substantial input \n\n  5\n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic \n\nfrom an international road safety expert. Road safety audits will also be conducted during and \nafter construction. The PIU\u2019s experience in implementing a World Bank-financed project,5 along \nwith its demonstrated capacity to carry out project preparation and implementation, will help to \nensure improved project readiness and mitigate the risk of delay. \n\n19. \nSelection  of  the  project  roads  combined  weighted  scores  for  economic  viability  with \nscores  derived  from  the  environmental  and  social  screening  exercises.  The  economic \nevaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life cycle road agency and \nuser costs with and without the project, using net present value with a 12% discount rate and \nthe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The Highway Development and \nManagement  (HDM-4)  system,  which  focuses  on  transport  cost  savings,  was  used  in  the \nanalysis. The EIRR for the project is about 34.8% and ranges from 13.7% to 61.7% for each of \nthe  project  corridors.  Overall,  the  project  has  a  high  EIRR,  satisfying  the  economic  efficiency \ncriteria.  \n \n20. \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  capital \ncosts increase by 15%, (ii) benefits (vehicle operating costs and travel time savings) decrease  \nby  15%,  (iii)  capital  costs  increase  by  15%  and  benefits  decrease  by  15%,  (iv)  time-related \nbenefits are excluded, and (v) benefits to nonmotorized traffic are excluded. The results show \nthat the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. EIRRs for the project \nrange from 24.6% in the worst case scenario to 34.8% in the base case scenario. All selected \ncorridors have an EIRR above 12% in most sensitivity tests.6  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nInstitutional  capacity.  The  PIU  was  established  in  2001  to  manage  a  World-Bank-\n21. \nfinanced  project  over  2001\u20132007  (footnote  5)  and  has  developed  adequate  experience, \nqualifications,  and  capacity  to  manage  externally  funded  projects.  It  has  been  managing  the \npreparation  of  new  projects  for  external  financing  and  is  using  the  services  of  the  project \ncoordination  consultant  to  prepare  designs,  bidding  documents,  and  support  other  project-\nrelated activities. Civil works will be supervised by a firm of construction supervision consultants.  \n \n22. \nFinancial  management.  The  PIU  has  demonstrated  adequate  capacity  to  handle \nfinancial  management  of  externally  funded  projects.  In  June  2010,  it  underwent  a  financial \nmanagement assessment in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.7 The overall inherent risk was \nestimated as negligible and the overall control risk was estimated as moderate. A set of actions \nto mitigate the risks was identified. GOK has committed to implement all actions identified. By \nApril 2011, before the start of the project, GOK  will start a three-tier audit system, including (i) a \npre-audit  within  the  PIU,  (ii)  a  quarterly  internal  audit  by  chartered  accountant,  and  (iii)  a \nstatutory audit by the comptroller and auditor general of India.8  \n \nProcurement.

Households  engaged  in  agricultural  labor  account  for  40%  of  the  total \npopulation in rural Karnataka, while self-employed agricultural workers constitute 38%. In urban \nKarnataka, the regular wage or salary earning class constitutes the largest occupational group.  \n \n27. \nAt  focus  group  discussions  during  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  communities \nlooked  forward  to  the  better  access  and  enhanced  mobility  the  project  will  bring.  Better \nconnections  will \nlocal  government  and \ndevelopment agency offices, health centers, schools, colleges, and market places. Better roads \nwill  also  improve  social  networking.  In  addition  to  the  longer  term  positive  impact  on  poverty \nreduction,  the  project  will  also  have  a  short-term  impact,  as  the  rural  poor  will  be  hired  for \nconstruction, tree planting, and routine maintenance work. These opportunities will increase the \nearnings of the poor, who now depend largely on occasional and uncertain employment. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  offer  new  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by  providing  better \nlinks  to  markets,  production  centers,  and  other  areas  with  economic  opportunities.  The  rural \npopulation will be able to transport produce more quickly and to increase profit margins as they \nwill no longer depend solely on local markets and middlemen. \n \nGender. The gender development index  10 in Karnataka (0.637) is much higher than the \n29. \nnational figure (0.609). Karnataka ranks 6 among the 15 major states in gender development. \nWomen  are  mainly  involved  in  household  work,  cultivation,  and  other  agricultural  activities, \nincluding  some  employment  in  government  and  the  private  sector.  Their  use  of  roads  ranges \nfrom  day-to-day  household  activities  to  economic  activities  such  as  those  connected  with \nagriculture and marketing. Improvements to roads and better connections to the main network \nwill  improve  access  for  women  and  children  to  social  services,  markets,  work  place,  higher \nlevels of schooling, health facilities, and employment opportunities. Travel time savings due to \nimproved road conditions will result in more time spent on productive activities, health care, and \nself development. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Data in this section are derived from the 2001 national census. \n10 Gender development index measures how human development indices are differentiated by gender in the following \n\nareas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a standard of living. \n\n  7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nHIV  and  AIDS.  Karnataka  is  one  of  four  large  southern  India  states  with  a  relatively \n30. \nadvanced HIV epidemic. The adult HIV prevalence in several districts has exceeded 1% for the \npast  9  years.  As  a  part  of  the  National  AIDS  Control  Program  of  the  National  AIDS  Control \nOrganization, Karnataka has been conducting HIV sentinel surveillance since 1998. According \nto national family health survey, 0.69% of women (age 15-49 years) and men (age 15-54 years) \nin Karnataka are HIV positive. HIV prevalence among men is 0.85% and HIV prevalence among \nwomen is 0.54%. \n \nThe detailed poverty and social assessment study done during project preparation does \n31. \nnot  anticipate  a  rise  in  the  incidence  of  HIV  and  AIDS  as  a  result  of  the  project.  The  Health \nDepartment  and  the  Karnataka  State  AIDS  Control  Society  are  already  carrying  out  state, \ndistrict,  and  block  level  campaigns  to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease.  In  addition,  the  PIU \nand  NGOs  implementing  resettlement  plans  will  involve  the  Karnataka  State  AIDS  Control \nSociety  and  other  local  health  agencies  in  social  awareness  programs  (on  various  subjects, \nincluding HIV and AIDS) in the project areas. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nEnvironmental  impact.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Initial environmental examinations were therefore prepared \nfor  all  project  roads,  including  the  rail  overbridges.  The  main  environmental  concerns  with \nrespect  to  this  project  are  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety,  traversed  notified \nforestlands, and the substantial number of old trees to be cleared along the right of way. \n \nOccupational  and  community  health  and  safety  will  be  addressed  through  temporary \n33. \ntraffic management plans for work zones, which will be subject to road safety audits. Workers \nwill receive mandatory safety training and be provided with personal protective gear. Emergency \nhealth care will be available and health information will be disseminated. All notified traversed \nforestlands were established by the government for reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded \nlands;  none  are  natural  or  critical  habitats  for  biodiversity.  A  memorandum  of  agreement  has \nbeen  signed  between  the  PIU  and  the  Forest  Department  on  afforestation  of  degraded \nforestlands  and  community  forestry.  The  number  of  old  trees  (e.g.,  acacia  and  ficus)  to  be \ncleared has been minimized through road alignments, without negatively affecting road safety, \nalthough the species are not on the endangered list and do not have nationally protected status. \nThis approach has enabled about 800 trees with girths exceeding 30 centimeters to be saved. \nThe  mandatory  compensatory  plantation  providing  for  planting  of  two  trees  for  every  one  tree \ncleared  was  observed  in  the  environment  management  plans.  No  tree  cutting  will  be  allowed \nwithout prior clearance from the Forest Department. Compensatory plantation will be carried out \nby  the  Forest  Department  on  behalf  of  the  PIU.  The  PIU  will  coordinate  with  the  Forest \nDepartment  to  ensure  that  roadside  plantations  will  not  interfere  with  vehicle  travel  and  road \nmaintenance, will not cover signals and signs, and will not affect sight distances. PIU will submit \nto ADB progress reports on compensatory plantation twice a year. The PIU will be responsible \nfor implementing the environmental management plan (EMP) and will monitor the compliance of \ncontractors  with  the  EMP.  It  will  ensure  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  implemented \nthrough the dedicated EMP implementation unit. Progress reports on the implementation of the \nEMP will be submitted to ADB twice a year. \n \n34. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  as  category  A  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Separate  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared  for  each  project  road  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nrelevant national and state laws and regulations. \n\n\f \n35. \nComplete details of compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, assisting with \nshifting,  and  other  income  restoration  assistance  are  provided  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the \nresettlement  plans, 11  which  also  include  additional  support  for  affected  people  belonging  to \nvulnerable groups. Consultations with displaced persons, including on issues related to the land \nacquisition and compensation process, were undertaken during preparation of the resettlement \nplans.  Resettlement  plans  are  disclosed  to  the  public  through  the  ADB  website.  If  during \ndetailed design and implementation any modification is required, or if there is an additional land \nrequirement, or if involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, a related resettlement plan will \nbe prepared or an original plan will be modified in accordance with the applicable laws referred \nto  in  the  original  resettlement  plan.  Prior  approval  by  ADB  will  be  obtained  before  further \nimplementation of the relevant section of the project road takes place. \n \n36. \nImpact  on  indigenous  peoples. The project is classified under category C for impact \non  indigenous  people.  The  project  area  has  no  demarcated  area  for  indigenous  people.  The \npoverty  and  social  assessment  revealed  no  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  groups  within  the \narea of influence of the subprojects. However, if any adverse impacts on indigenous people are \nidentified  during  design  or  implementation,  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. This will be approved by ADB before \nthe  award  of  any  related  civil  works  contract, and  implemented  before  commencement  of  civil \nworks  on  the  relevant  section  of  the  project  road.  Any  subsequent  updating  of  the  indigenous \npeoples plan will require prior ADB approval before any further implementation of the relevant \nsection of the project road.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nproject \nimplementation \n\nSustainability of \nPRAMC \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nAn experienced and fully staffed PIU with field offices near the project roads is already \nin  place.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works  and  construction  supervision \nhas started. The PIU is supported by the project coordination consultant. It is targeting \nat least 50% of the land acquisition to have been carried out by 31 March 2011, and \n100%  by  31  May  2011,  i.e.,  by  the  start  of  civil  works.  General  clearance  by  the \nKarnataka State Pollution Control Board and environmental clearance for all packages \nhave already been secured. Administrative approval for shifting of utilities has already \nbeen  given  and  preparatory  works  for  the  shifting  of  utilities  have  started.  To  ensure \ntimely \ninstitutional  development  component,  GOK  has \ncommitted to fill 50% of all PRAMC positions with permanent staff by June 2011 and \n100% by January 2012. PWD will provide adequate office space for PRAMC by June \n2011. \nTo  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  PRAMC,  a  consultant  will  prepare  business \nprocedures  (6  months),  carry  out  day-to-day  operations  with  PRAMC  staff  (2  years), \nand monitor and support PRAMC operations on an as-needed basis (6 months). GOK \nhas committed itself to establishing a PRAMC office and not to transfer PRAMC staff \nfor at least 5 years. \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n11 Resettlement Plans (Accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n  9\n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nRisks \nInsufficient \nmaintenance \nfinancing  \n\nMitigating Measures \nGOK\u2019s  initiative  to  establish  PRAMC  to  improve  planning  and  budgeting  will  be \nsupported  by  the  project.  GOK  will  establish  data-driven  allocation  of  annual  road \nmaintenance budget for the core road network. The target is for the entire allocation to \nbe  based  on  the  PRAMS.  The  associated  capacity  development  TA  will  provide \nadvisory  services  for  private  sector  participation.  GOK  has  given  assurances  that \nadequate and timely funding is provided for maintenance of the roads upgraded under \nthe project and that the PWD will take up the maintenance of the roads either by itself \nor  through  private  contractors.  GOK  is  in  the  process  of  establishing  the  State  Road \nFund as an additional and sustainable source for the development and maintenance of \nthe state road network. \n\nGOK=  Government  of  Karnataka,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PRAMC  =  Planning  and  Road  Asset \nManagement Centre, PRAMS = Planning and Road Asset Management System, PWD = Public Works Department, \nTA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n38. \nThe  government  and  the  GOK  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n39. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  and  the  GOK  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$315,000,000  to  India  for  the  Karnataka  State  Highway  Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n4 November 2010\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Appendix 1 \n\n       11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms\n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nAccelerated \neconomic growth in \nthe state of \nKarnataka \n\nOutcome \nMore efficient and \nsustainable transport \noperations on the \nstate highway \nnetwork \n\nOutputs \n1.
