The  new  road  section  between \nPhuentsholing and Chamkuna will (i) complete the last missing 3.3-kilometer (km) link along the \nPhuentsholing\u2013Samtse national highway, (ii) activate the full value of the entire 58 km Southern \nEast\u2013West  Highway  (SEWH)  section for  road  users,  and (iii)  link  Samtse  district to the rest of \nthe  country.  The  trade  facilitation  and  logistics  component  is  aimed  at  improving  the \ninfrastructure  and  services  at  the  border  crossing  points  by  adding  additional  equipment  to \nfacilitate  cross-border  traffic  and  transit  of  goods  and  services,  trade,  and  commerce \nnationwide.2 These  interventions  are  targeted  at  improving  the  working  conditions  and  service \ndelivery at the checkpoints so that goods and services can be exported and imported safely and \nefficiently. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nLandlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \ncountry\u2019s  small  population  of  about  745,000  is  dispersed  throughout  its  mostly  mountainous \nterrain.3 Formidable  weather  conditions  make  it  difficult  and  expensive  to  deliver  services  and \nbuild  and  maintain  vital  infrastructure,  particularly  roads.  Almost  two-thirds  of  Bhutan\u2019s \npopulation still lives in rural areas and  depends on an improved and available road network to \nensure its daily basic needs. Bordered by India in the east, west, and south, Bhutan is heavily \nreliant on its much larger neighbor for international trade. India accounts for 84% of its exports, \nincluding  electricity,  and  73%  of  its  imports.4 However,  Bhutan\u2019s  inadequate  cross-border  road \nnetwork and customs infrastructure are hampering its international trade and logistics capacity. \nIt  is  important  to  lower  high  transport  costs  and  improve  accessibility  and  customs  clearance \nservices to spur the country\u2019s economic and social development. \n \n4. \nRoad transport is the dominant mode of transport for passengers and freight  within the \ncountry and with neighboring states in India, and national highways are the main arteries in the \nroad  network.  However,  road  construction  in  Bhutan  remains  a  challenge  due  to  the  difficult \nenvironment  and  extreme  weather  conditions,  especially  during  the  monsoon  season,  when \nlandslides make roads along the hillsides unpassable. \n \nThe main border crossing point between Bhutan and India is in the city of Phuentsholing \n5. \nand connects Bhutan\u2019s north\u2013south highway to India\u2019s national highway network. Phuentsholing \nis the most important gateway for cross-border traffic and accounts for 74% of the total value of \nimport and export trade in the country. The inadequacy of the border facilities in dealing with this \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the project; \nBHU TA 8708 Kingdom of Bhutan: South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Transport, Trade Facilitation \nand Logistics Project. \n\n3  ADB. 2015. Basic Statistics 2015. Manila. \n4  Bhutan\u2019s  international sea  trade currently  moves through  Kolkata  Port in  India.  Chittagong  Port  in  Bangladesh is \n\nexpected to become an alternative port in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftraffic  causes  long  idle  times,  particularly  when  clearing  goods  for  transport,  which  leads  to \nheavy congestion and constrains trade in the city. \n \n6. \nBhutan  is  a  member  of  the  SASEC  Trade  Facilitation  Program  and  receives  support \nthrough  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  multilateral  donors  in  complying  with \ninternational  standards  and  facilitate  the  safe  and  efficient  trade  of  goods.  However,  cross-\nborder  trade,  logistics  procedures,  and  infrastructure  require  more  extensive  assistance. \nCurrently there are no cross-border facilities for trade on either side of the border. Through ADB \nassistance,  construction  of  a  new  mini  dry  port  (MDP)  in  Phuentsholing  and  a  land  custom \nstation  (LCS)  in  Allay  will  be  completed  by  early  2019. 5 The  trade  facilitation  and  logistics \ncomponent  under  this  project  will  finance  identified  additional  equipment  for  trade  facilitation, \nwhich will supplement the ADB-financed infrastructure and improve the customs processes for \nhandling  goods  in  the  two  cross-border  facilities  to  support  efficient  and  secure  cross-border \ntrade in the  subregion. The main beneficiaries of  improved  handling  of goods  are the  industry \nand trade, and agriculture sectors. Key imports are construction materials, food, and household \ngoods;  key  exports  are  timber,  cardamom,  apples,  potatoes,  oranges,  steel,  and  ferro-alloys. \nThe project will expedite customs modernization and reform processes and help Bhutan comply \nwith the revised Kyoto Convention standards to simplify and harmonize customs procedures.6 \n \n7. \nThe government\u2019s strategic thrusts under the country\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2013\u2013\n2018,  are  inclusive  social  development,  accelerated  green  economic  development,  and \nstrategic infrastructure development.7 In the transport sector, this involves the construction and \nimprovement  of  national  highways.  Improving  efficiency  in  the  sector  will  boost  domestic  and \ncross-border trade and allow for better delivery and wider coverage of basic social services. \n \n8. \nThe  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  has  aimed  to  improve  road  conditions  through \nsustainable  road  development  and  maintenance.  It  provides  its  staff  with  on-the-job  training \nabout  international  best  practices  from  international  consultants,  mainly  during  the  course  of \nimplementing  projects  financed  by  ADB  or  other  bilateral  development  partners.  This  has \nresulted  in  a  growing  number  of  dedicated  and  technically  capable  staff,  and  has  helped \novercome deficiencies in road maintenance capacity, road asset management, and road safety \nissues.  The  budget  allocation  for  appropriate  road  maintenance  has  steadily  increased  since \n2011,  and  the  DOR  is  increasing  the  number  of  maintenance  centers  to  provide  sufficient \npreventive  maintenance  and  respond  faster  to  damage  caused  by  landslides  or  other  natural \ndisasters.  ADB  has  helped  Bhutan  develop  its  road  sector  strategy,  road  asset  management, \nand  road  safety  program  through  more  than  10  technical  assistance  projects,  which  have \nfacilitated the establishment and enhancement of the DOR\u2019s internal capacity. \n \n9. \nThe government has requested ADB financial assistance for the prioritized construction \nof  the  missing  3.3 km  Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna  link.  The  completed  SEWH  section  between \nPhuentsholing and Samtse will provide a direct inland connection, which is important to develop \nthe  southwestern  part  of  Bhutan.  Currently,  connecting  to  Samtse  district  involves  indirect \nroutes,  either  south  via  India  or  through  a  long  indirect  journey  using  the  northern  east\u2013west \nhighway.  The  completed  section  also  runs  parallel  to  the  Indian  border  and  connects  several \ntowns  in  the  country\u2019s  southwestern  part,  which  had  previously  not  been  connected  by  a \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

It  will  also  indirectly  connect  with  Ha  district,  which  is  now  only \nconnected  to  the  north  and  requires  long  detours  to  reach  the  commercial  hub  and  border \ncrossing  point  in  Phuentsholing.  The  provision  of  a  domestic  road  connection  will  reduce  the \ntravel distance between Samtse and Chhukha districts and decongest the main border crossing \nin  Phuentsholing.  As  a  result,  the  Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna  road  will  foster  inclusiveness  by \ngiving  larger  segments  of  Samtse  and  Ha  districts\u2019  populations  better  access  to  markets  and \nbasic services in Phuentsholing. \n \nThe  3.3  km  Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna  link  will  complete  the  last  part  of  the  58  km \n10. \nSEWH section and allow travelers to reap the full benefit of this national highway between the \ntwo districts. The 3.3 km road section is constructed partly on the bed of the Amochu River and \nadjoins  to  a  steep  and  unstable  slope  on  the  eastern  side.  Due  to  these  characteristics  and \ntechnical  challenges,  the  road  could  not  be  developed  solely  with  government  funding, \nespecially since the road is also the first of this type to be built in the country. In the west, the \nroad  will  connect  to  the  existing  road  formation  leading  to  the  Amochu  Bridge.  At  the  eastern \nstart point, it will connect to the northern bypass road (footnote 5) and to the Omchu Bridge in \nPhuentsholing,  and  will  supplement  infrastructure  projects  in  the  region  funded  with  ADB \nassistance.8 Through traffic from the west, bound for the north and east, will therefore be able to \nbypass Phuentsholing. \n \n11. \nThe  project  and  its  outcome  are  consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for  Bhutan,  which  is  to  assist  the  government  in  (i) \nachieving  inclusive  economic  growth  by  developing  key  infrastructure  for  transport  and \nenhancing  trade facilitation,  and  (ii)  broadening  access  to  economic  opportunities  and making \ngrowth more inclusive by providing support to enhance national and cross-border connectivity.9 \nThe  project  also  supports  government  plans  for  the  construction  and  improvement  of  national \nhighways  to  boost  international  and  regional  trade.  The  project  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Bhutan and in the regional operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018 for South Asia.10 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  improved  mobility  and  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and \n12. \npassengers,  aligned  with  Bhutan\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan  (footnote  7).  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved road connectivity and service delivery at the border crossings in Samtse and Chhukha \ndistricts. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThere  will  be  two  outputs:  (i)  3.3  km  of  national  highway  constructed  between \nPhuentsholing  and  Chamkuna;  and  (ii)  equipment  for  trade facilitation  and  logistics  at  MDP  in \nPhuentsholing  and  the  LCS  in  Allay  procured  and  installed.  Output  1  consists  of  a  two-lane \nnational highway section with pedestrian walkways on a 6-meter high embankment to take into \naccount  the  special  environmental  conditions  along  a riverbed  (para.  10).  Output  2  includes  a \ntruck  X-ray  scanner,  handheld  scanners,  heavy  machinery  for  transshipment  and  off-loading \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2011.

The engineering design for the road is based on \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n \n\n\fsite conditions and field investigations, and includes protective measures for the embankment. \nThree actions to avoid erosion and deployment of flood control systems were integrated in the \npreliminary  design:  (i)  positioning  diverging  spurs  with  bank  reinforcement  and  anchoring  the \nembankment, (ii) training the river to maintain a safe distance between the main Amochu river \nchannel  and  the  embankment  during the construction,  and  (iii)  controlling surface runoff  laden \nwith  sediment  and  boulders  from  the  hillside  east  of  the  embankment  road  by  providing \nadequate channeling structures that will allow water to pass under the road toward the Amochu \nRiver.  The  design  will  optimize  the  construction  works  for  cost-effectiveness  and  use  proven \ntechnology  and  standard  materials  compatible  with  local  conditions  for  a  durable  road  with \noptimized  maintenance  costs.  The  chosen  road  alignment  has  the  least  impact  on  the \nenvironment  and social  safeguards  and  is closely  coordinated  with future projects  in the  area. \nMeasures  to  support  road  safety  and  climate  resilience  features  have  been  included  in  the \npreliminary design and will be confirmed during detailed road design. \n \n20. \nThe project will provide trade facilitation equipment at the MDP in Phuentsholing and the \nLCS in Allay in the form of (i) a truck gantry X-ray scanner; (ii) a container lifter; and (iii) several \nsmaller types of equipment, such as customs rummage kits, drug testing kits, safety protective \nwear, and closed-circuit television systems. The technical specifications for the trade facilitation \nequipment have been assessed by the design consultant under the ongoing project (footnote 5) \nand  are  included  in  the  design  layout  of  the  Phuentsholing  MDP  and  Allay  LCS.  The  number \nand  type  of  equipment  will  be  further  assessed  and  selected  during  project  implementation  to \nsupport the best possible functions and roles of the two trade facilities. \n \n21. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  Two  agencies  will  be  involved  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the equipment to be procured and infrastructure to be constructed under \nthe project: the DRC for the equipment at the Phuentsholing MDP and the Allay LCS, and the \nDOR for the 3.3 km national highway section. For the O&M of major equipment, a maintenance \ncontract and training for operating the machinery and equipment will be included in the supplier \ncontracts. To  help sustain  the  road component, the  construction  supervision  consultant  (CSC) \nrecruited  under  the  project  will  perform  on-the-job  training  to  develop  the  skills  and  ability  of \nDOR  staff  to  manage  the  road  assets  and  oversee  the  road  safety  and  climate  resilience \naspects of the project throughout construction. The CSC, together with the DOR, will assess the \nrequired and preventive road maintenance measures for the road. On this basis, the DOR will \nprepare  and  maintain  a  road  asset  management  system  during  project  implementation  to \nensure that sufficient annual funding is set aside for O&M after road completion. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.13 The \n22. \nproject  is  expected  to  (i)  increase  connectivity  by  completing  a  missing  link  of  the \nPhuentsholing\u2013Samtse  highway  between  Phuentsholing  and  Chamkuna,  which  will  provide \ntravel  time  and  vehicle operating  cost  savings  for  road  users;  and  (ii)  strengthen  cross-border \ntrade and economic development by providing trade facilitation equipment at border crossings, \nwhich will enhance operational efficiency and improve fraud prevention, control, and detection. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  17.0%  for  the  road \ncomponent and 15.5% for the trade facilitation and logistics component, with an overall EIRR of \n16.7%.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  both  project  components  would  remain  economically \nviable in the event of a 10% increase in cost, a 10% reduction in benefits, or a combined 10% \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nincrease in cost and 10% reduction in benefits. In this last scenario, the EIRR would be 15.1% \nfor the road component and 11.8% for the trade facilitation and logistics component. \n \n23. \nThe financial  sustainability  of recurrent  O&M  costs  was assessed for  each component. \nIncremental  annual  costs  for  the  Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna  road  are  estimated  to  account  for \n0.24%  of  the  DOR\u2019s  annual  road  maintenance  budget  of  Nu3.5  billion  in  FY2016.  Given  the \nactual  budget  and  the  commitment  of  the  government  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  road \nmaintenance  under  the  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  funds  will  be \navailable  to  meet  the  O&M  costs.  While  the  DOR\u2019s  budget  for  routine  maintenance  has \nsignificantly increased from Nu126.8 million in FY2012 to Nu281.1 million in FY2016, the budget \nfor periodic maintenance has varied by a factor of 1 to 7 in the same period. The risk associated \nwith  the  sustainability  of  the  road  section  has  therefore  been  rated  medium,  and  further \ndiscussions  are  proposed  with  the  DOR  and  the  government  to  help  secure  sufficient  budget \nallocations  for  road  O&M.  The  trade  facilitation  equipment  is  non-revenue  earning,  as  cost \nrecovery will not be directly sought from users. Instead, the equipment is expected to generate \nindirect revenues through additional taxes and fines by use of a truck gantry scanner, which will \nallow systematic inspections of trucks and increase fraud prevention, control, and detection. The \ntotal  annual  costs  required  for  the  O&M  of  the  trade  facilitation  equipment  are  estimated  to \namount to Nu21.8 million in 2019, or 41.1% of the expected additional customs revenues, which \nare tax revenues accruing to the general revenues of the government. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nInstitutional  capacity. The DOR will be the executing agency for the road component, \nand Phuentsholing Thromde, on behalf of the DRC, will be the executing agency for the trade \nfacilitation  and  logistics  component.  Both  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  have \nexperience  in  ADB-financed  projects  as  an  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  and \nhave appropriate staff at their disposal. \n \n25. \nFinancial management. An assessment of the accounting systems, financial reporting, \nand  external  audit  procedures  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  concluded  that  their \nfinancial  management  systems  are  satisfactory.  The  accounting  and  reporting  process  in  the \nfinance  and  accounting  manuals  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  followed.  The \nDOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  use  the  government\u2019s  standardized  budget  and  accounting \nsystem, which has been computerized since 2003, produces satisfactory financial reports, and \nensures  data  availability.  Each  project  implementation  unit  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing \nThromde will include a suitably qualified accountant. Each will maintain separate project records \nand  accounts  to  identify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project \nand  ensure  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The  Royal  Audit  Authority  of  Bhutan,  an  independent  and \nnonpartisan  institution  authorized  to  perform  audits  on  government  agencies,  will  audit  project \nfinancial statements annually in accordance with international auditing standards. \n \n26. \nProcurement.  The  overall  risk  related  to  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  DOR  and \nPhuentsholing  Thromde  has  been  assessed  as  low.  Both  have  implemented  ADB-funded \nprojects  in  the  past,  are  presently  implementing  the  SASEC  Road  Connectivity  Project,  and \nhave  procured  works  and  consulting  services  under  ADB  guidelines.  The  Public  Procurement \nPolicy  Division  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  oversees  public  procurement  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  (2009).  The  division  is  mandated  to \nrecommend  reforms  of  the  procurement  policy  or  laws  to  the  government,  prepare  standard \nbidding  documents,  issue  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement,  and  liaise  with \ngovernment  organizations  to  develop  human  resources  and  professionalism  in  procurement. \n\n \n\n\fThe regulations recognize that the procurement rules and procedures of development partners \nmay prevail in projects funded by development partners. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the  DOR,  and Phuentsholing Thromde. The  specific  policy  requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  Key  project  beneficiaries  are  the  estimated \n65,387  Samtse  district  residents,  25,000  Phuentsholing  residents,  and  traders  and  business \nowners from India and Bhutan. Chhukha district, where Phuentsholing is located, has a poverty \nrate of 11.2% compared with 22.2% in Samtse district. The road component will facilitate safer \nand  more  reliable  access  between  Samtse  and  Phuentsholing,  providing  an  alternative  to \ntraveling  via  India,  which  is  currently  the  main  link  between  these  two  towns.  It  will  provide \nSamtse district residents with better access to markets and services in Phuentsholing. The trade \nfacilitation  and  logistics  component  will  improve  import  and  export  processes  in  the  most \nimportant  gateway  for  cross-border  traffic  in  the  country,  facilitating  household  access  to \ncompetitively  priced  goods  and  contributing  to  the  country\u2019s  development  and  integration  with \nregional and international markets. \n \n29. \nGender.  The  gender  assessment  conducted  during  preparation  (footnote  2)  indicates \nthat  women  will  benefit  equally  from  the  road,  with  90%  of  them  feeling  comfortable  traveling \nalone  in  taxis  and  buses  or  using  their  private  vehicles.  Most  of  the  women  consulted  (92%) \nwere  not  interested  in  participating  in  construction  activities,  as  most  of  them  work  in  the  civil \nservice or in the private sector, or manage their own businesses. Women are, however, likely to \nparticipate in maintenance activities, as females represent currently already more than 50% of \nthe  road  maintenance  national  workforce.  The  project  is  to  be  categorized  as  having  some \ngender  elements  with  the  implementation  of  the  following  gender  mainstreaming  activities:  (i) \nincluding  pedestrian-  and  women-friendly  design  features,  such  as  pedestrian  walkways, \nbenches,  and  signage;  (ii)  conducting  (a)  training  sessions  for  DOR  officials  on  how  to  better \nintegrate gender design features into future projects, and (b) on-the-job training for DOR staff on \nimproving  the  integration  of  social  and  gender  mainstreaming  features  into  future  project \ndesigns; and (iii) targeting 50% participation of women in community awareness campaigns on \nsexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \nHIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and labor. The prevalence of HIV and human trafficking \n30. \nin  the  project  area  is  low,  and  public  information  on  human  trafficking  is  not  available.  The \nmajority of people (92%) surveyed  during project preparation  were aware of HIV transmission, \nprotection practices, and detection programs in Phuentsholing. However, given that the project \nis  located  in  a  border  area,  community  awareness  campaigns  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  project,  and  the  contractor  will  conduct  HIV/AIDS \nawareness sessions for its  labor force.  Moreover,  the  labor force  will  benefit from  government \nprograms under the National AIDS Control Program. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as C for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Due  diligence  of \nsocial impacts of the road works concluded that the project will neither affect private assets nor \ncause physical or economic displacement. The road alignment is located on government land, \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nand  field  verification  and  consultations  confirmed  the  absence  of  private  assets  within  the \ncorridor of impact. The trade facilitation and logistics component does not have any resettlement \nimpacts. There are no indigenous people in the project area. The civil works under this project \nwill not affect any persons and the project is categorized as C for indigenous peoples. \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  impact.  In  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  the  road  project  component  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  B. \nTherefore,  an  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP), has been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. The main environmental impacts \nof the project are related to the construction of the 3.3 km embankment road that is 4\u20136 meters \nabove the existing ground level, of which about 1.0 km directly abuts the Amochu River bank. \nThe  construction  will  require  dredging,  erosion  protection  works,  and  river  training.  Significant \nslope  stabilization  in  the  form  of  gabions,  spur  dikes,  and  river  channels  were  incorporated  in \nthe  design  to  provide  adequate  toe  and  flank  protection  of  the  embankment  road  against  the \nerosive  force  of  the  Amochu  River.  Although  less  severe,  other  impacts  are  related  to  the \nborrow  area  and  the  transport  of  material  and  should  also  be  addressed.  The  environmental \nimpacts  include deterioration of  air quality from dust  and  vehicular  emissions,  increased  noise \nlevel,  vibration,  deterioration  of  surface  water  quality,  and  occupational  and  community  health \nand  safety.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  EMP  to  address  these  impacts \nand  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  The  key  long-term  impacts  of  vehicular \nemissions  will  be  managed  through  mandatory  annual  vehicular  emission  testing.  Meaningful \nconsultations were conducted during the project preparation stage, and concerns of the affected \npersons  and  stakeholders  were  considered  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nEMP.  The  consultations  were  attended  by  representatives  from  key  environmental  agencies, \nintegrated  social  and \nroadside  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  An \nenvironmental grievance redress mechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedbacks \nand complaints, if any, from affected parties, and to address them during the construction and \noperation  stages. The project management  unit for  the  Phuentsholing\u2013Chamkuna  road  will  be \ncreated under the DOR, which will include an environmental specialist to supervise the effective \nimplementation of the EMP and the preparation of semiannual environmental monitoring reports \nfor  public  disclosure.  The  project  management  unit  will  be  supported  by  the  CSC  who  will \ninclude an environmental specialist in their team. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.14 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate coordination \namong relevant ministries and \nproject executing agencies \nProject implementation delay  Detailed design and bidding for the road component and the trade \n\nA steering committee representing all the project-related government \ninstitutions will be formed for project implementation, and regular \nmeetings will be held twice a year, or as may be necessary. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nfacilitation and logistics component will be conducted by existing CSCs \nunder the SASEC Road Connectivity Project (footnote 5).
