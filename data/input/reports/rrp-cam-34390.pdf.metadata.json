An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \n\n \nCooperation  in  the  electric  power  sector  has  been  an  important \nfeature of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program initiated \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1992. The extension of \ntrade  in  power  between  the  GMS  countries  has  been  a  primary \nobjective  of  the  Electric  Power  Forum  and  the  Experts  Group  on \nPower  Interconnection  and  Trade.  Through  these  bodies,  a \nmaster  plan  for  interconnection  between the GMS countries was \ndevised  that  will  lead  to  cost  savings,  security  of  supply,  and \nenvironmental  benefits.  The  Project,  which  consists  of  the \ninstallation of a 200-megawatt capacity transmission line from the \nVietnamese border to Phnom Penh, will be the first component of \nthe  master  plan  to  be  implemented.  Benefits  will  accrue  to  both \ncountries: Cambodia will be assured of a more reliable, lower-cost \nsupply  of  electricity  than  from  any  feasible  alternative,  and  Viet \nNam  will  accelerate  the  electrification of a remote region. During \nthe initial years of the Project, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) will \nbe able to meet up to 60% of the demand for electricity in greater \nPhnom Penh via the transmission line with a significant reduction \nin its cost structure.  In the medium term, the Project will improve \nEDC\u2019s  financial  viability,  reduce  pressure  on  tariffs,  and  help \nCambodian industry to become competitive.  \n \nA  bulk  supply  distribution  component  will  provide  reliable  \nmedium-voltage  supplies  to  villages  along  the  transmission  line \nroute  and  encourage  small  private  operators  to  invest  in,  and \noperate,  connections \nto  rural  end-consumers.  Private  rural \nelectricity enterprises have proved to be key to rural electrification. \nAssistance  under  this  component  will  help  them  operate  in  the \nnew, regulated environment.  \n \nThe high cost of electricity is one of the key obstacles to economic \ngrowth in Cambodia. EDC therefore needs an additional source of \npower  at  lower  cost,  such  as  imports  from  Viet  Nam  via  a \ntransmission  line.  This  will  initiate  a  virtuous  cycle  of  lower  costs \nthat  will  allow  EDC  to  become  financially  viable  and  to  invest  so \nas to meet growing demand. The transmission line, which will be \nfunded  under  the  loan,  will  reduce  pressure  to  increase  tariffs to \nachieve  a \nthereby  encouraging \ncompanies that currently operate their own generators to switch to  \n\nreliable  electricity  supply, \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nlong-term  growth \n\nEDC\u2019s  system.  As  demand  grows,  EDC  will  be  able  to  generate \npower  (or  purchase  power  from  independent  power  producers) \nusing larger, more efficient generating units, and will eventually be \nable  to  reduce  tariffs  to  levels  that  are  competitive  in  the  region. \nfor \nThe  Project  will  promote  sustainable \nCambodia and will build on the results of policy dialogue between \nthe  Government,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank  on  reducing  barriers \nthat are preventing the poor from connecting to a modern energy \nsupply.  EDC  will  introduce  a  lower-cost  connection  suitable  for \nlow-consumption  customers,  prepare  user-friendly  bills,  and \nimprove customer services.  \n \nThe  bulk  supply  distribution  component  will  connect  rural  poor \ncommunities  along  the  transmission  line  that  may  be  affected  by \nthe  construction.  This  component  will  substantially  lower  energy \ncosts for rural households and bring direct benefits to the poor. \n \nTo  stimulate  trade  and  economic  growth  in  the  subregion  by \npromoting  the  provision  of  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  at \naffordable prices to consumers in Cambodia. \n \nTo promote socioeconomic development and  poverty reduction in \nCambodia  by  enhancing  accessibility  to  electricity  on  the  part  of \nthe  poor  by  continuing  to  reduce  the  high  up-front  connection \ncosts. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $95.0  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $58.5  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $36.5 \nmillion equivalent in domestic currency costs. \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  of  up  to  $44.3  million  equivalent  will \nfinance  46%  of  the  total  project  cost,  including  $8.8  million \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The World Bank will provide \nparallel cofinancing of $16.0 million as part of its proposed Rural \nElectrification  and  Transmission  Project  and \nthe  Nordic \nDevelopment Fund (NDF) will provide \u20ac10 million. \n \n\nForeign Currency \n($ million) \n\nLocal Currency \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n\nSource of Funds \n\nAsian Development Bank \nWorld Bank \nNordic Development Fund \nGovernment Counterpart Funds \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\nTotal \n\n35.5 \n12.5 \n10.5 \n0.0 \n58.5 \n\n8.8 \n3.5 \n0.5 \n23.7 \n36.5 \n\n44.3 \n16.0 \n11.0 \n23.7 \n95.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  up  to  SDR30.94  million  (equivalent  to \n$44.3  million)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources,  on  standard \nterms. \n \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  borrower  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  (except  for \n$300,000,  which  will  be  provided  to  EDC  and  the  Electricity \nAuthority  of  Cambodia  as  a  grant)  to  the  executing  agency  for  a \n20-year  term,  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  at  an  interest  rate \nof 4.2%.

Procurement \nfor  project \ncomponents  financed  by  the  World  Bank  and  NDF  will  be  made \nunder their respective procurement guidelines. \n \nEDC  will  recruit  and  supervise \nimplementation \nconsultants  (PICs)  and  all  other  consultants  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.

Key  beneficiaries  in  Cambodia \ninclude  EDC,  EDC\u2019s  consumers  in  greater  Phnom  Penh,  and \nindirectly  the  population  at  large  through  economic  growth.  In \naddition,  the  bulk  supply  component  will  provide  electricity  to \nabout 14,200 households in Takeo Province. About 5,700 of these \nhouseholds  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Overall,  the  Project  will \nprovide a net economic benefit of about $31.2 million to the poor \nin Cambodia.  \n \nEvaluation  of  key  risks  to  the  transmission  line  related  to \nconstruction  delays  and  increased  costs,  lower  than  expected \ndemand  for  or  availability  of  supply,  or  increased  import  price  of \nelectricity,  demonstrated  that  the  Project  is  economically  and \nfinancially  robust.  The  Vietnamese  authorities  have  given  an \nassurance  that  the  linking  transmission  project  in  Viet  Nam, \nfunded by World Bank, will be completed ahead of this Project.  \n \nThe  viability  of  the  bulk  supply  component  depends  on  the \nassumed  connection  rate  being  attained,  which  in  turn  depends \non  sufficient  numbers  of  private  operators  investing  in  the \nconnection \nindividual  households.  The  Project  has  a \ncomponent  to  help  potential  small  operators  avail themselves of \nfinancial support and secure licenses, but if this does not succeed, \nthis  component  can  be  scaled  back  with \nimplementation \ncommencing  with  the  potentially  most  profitable  areas  close  to \nPhnom Penh and Takeo. \n \n\nto \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Transmission  Project. \nThe project proposal is included in the country strategy and program update (2003\u20132005). The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  played  a  leading  role  in  GMS  cooperation  in \nthe electric power sector as part of its program for economic cooperation in the GMS that ADB \ninitiated in 1992. ADB assisted with the formation of the Electric Power Forum and the Experts \nGroup  on  Power  Interconnection  and  Trade  and  continues  to  support  their  activities.  ADB  is \ncurrently providing technical assistance to develop a regional power trade operating agreement. \nThis  agreement  will  contain  rules  and  guidelines  for  technical  coordination  among  GMS \nmembers,  cross-border  transmission  pricing  schemes,  and  specify  the  required  institutional \nframework  for  advancing  trade  in  power  in  the  subregion  under  the  Intergovernmental \nAgreement on Regional Power Trade in the GMS.1  \n \n3. \nSubregional  electricity  trade  based  on  interconnected  electric  power  networks  will \nprovide  significant  economic  and  environmental  benefits  for  individual  countries  and  for  the \nentire  subregion.  Such  trade  will  enable  GMS  members  to  (i)  reduce  national  investments  in \npower  reserves  maintained  to  meet  peak  demand,  (ii)  provide  a  more  reliable  supply  of \nelectricity,  (iii)  reduce  operating  costs,  (iv)  lower  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  other \npollutants,  and  (v)  increase  consumers\u2019  access  to  the  cheapest  sources  of  electricity  in  the \nsubregion (Appendix 2). \n \n4. \nIn anticipation of the development of a policy framework for promoting trade in power in \nthe  region,  starting  in  October  2000  and  with  ADB  assistance,  the  regional  indicative  master \nplan  on  power  interconnection  in  the  GMS  was  developed  to  identify  the  physical  power \ninterconnections  needed  in  the  subregion  up  to  2020.2  Of  the  identified  power  transmission \ninterconnections  needed, \ninterconnection  between  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  was \nprogrammed for 2003. \n \nThe electricity supply in Cambodia is currently fragmented and varies significantly across \n5. \nthe  country.  Cambodia  does  not  have  a  transmission  grid,  so  systems,  where  they  exist,  are \noperated independently. Three main types of electricity supply are in operation:  (i)  the greater \nPhnom Penh system, (ii) the systems for provincial capitals and some other major towns, and \n(iii)  the  provisions  for  the  rest  of  the  country.  Phnom  Penh  has  a  fully  developed,  reticulated \nsystem supplied by Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), which  was established by royal decree in \nMarch 1996 as a result of dialogue with ADB and other development agencies. EDC is a limited \nliability  company  owned  jointly  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy  (MIME)  and  the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF).  It  has  its  own  board  of  directors  and  operates  with \nconsiderable  independence  except  in  the  field  of  tariff  setting.  Its  charter  empowers  EDC  to \n                                                 \n1 All six members of the GMS signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade in the GMS at the \nFirst GMS Summit meeting on 3 November 2002. \n2 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Regional Indicative Master Plan on Power Interconnection in the \nGMS. Manila (TA No. 5920-REG, for $630,000, approved on 10 July 2000). \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2\n\nprovide a nonexclusive, full electricity service for the whole country. EDC supplies Phnom Penh \nfrom its own generators and from purchases from independent power producers (IPPs) located \nin  the  city  suburbs.  A  115-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  main  distributes  power  between  three \nsubstations, from where medium-voltage networks and low-voltage connections supply power to \nconsumers  throughout  most  of  the  city.  Over  the  last  decade  the  system  has  been  gradually \nrefurbished and expanded, and now provides a reasonably reliable service to its customers but \nat an average tariff of KR589/kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.15/kWh). \n \nEDC\u2019s  high  tariff  results  from  the  small  size  of  the  system  and  the  rapid  growth  (in \n6. \npercentage  terms)  in  demand  in  recent  years.  EDC  owns  and  operates  small,  less  than  \n5 megawatt (MW), generating units fueled by expensive light diesel or, more recently, by heavy \nfuel oil, which carries less tax and results in a 40% overall cost saving. The small demand and \nthe small additional units required to meet incremental demand prevent EDC from realizing the \neconomies of scale that larger generating units might obtain. EDC purchases more than 50% of \nits  energy  requirements  from  IPPs  at  a  cost  of  $0.11  to  $0.13/kWh,  and  also  buys  a  small \namount  of  energy  from  the  private  Kirirom  hydroelectric  plant  at  $0.07/kWh.  In  addition,  EDC \nincurs the costs associated with operating a utility, including technical and nontechnical losses \nof about 14%.  \n \n7. \nUntil  recently,  the  electricity  systems  in  all  provincial  towns  were  operated  by  MIME\u2019s \ndepartment  offices.  In  most  towns,  the  department  offices  owned  the  low-voltage  distribution \nsystems (they do not have any medium-voltage systems), and originally also owned the diesel-\nfueled generating sets. In some locations, IPPs have expanded low-voltage coverage and even \noperate  the  entire  system;  however,  these  systems  are  generally  inadequate,  unsafe,  and \nexpensive with an average tariff of KR2,100/kWh ($0.53/kWh). The exceptions are where EDC \nhas  taken  control  of  the  systems  and  rehabilitated  them  using  grants  and  concessional  loans. \nUntil recently, EDC only operated the systems in Phnom Penh and the urban areas of Kandal, \nKompong  Cham,  Siem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville.  During  2000,  it  took  over  the  operations  in \nTakeo and Battambang. In these EDC operated areas, the systems are safe, are more reliable, \nand provide 24-hour per day service, but the tariffs are higher than in Phnom Penh and range \nfrom KR800/kWh to KR1,200/kWh ($0.20/kWh to $0.30/kWh). \n \nThe  availability  of  electricity  away  from  the  central  areas  of  the  provincial  towns  is \n8. \nerratic.  Rural  electricity  enterprises  (REEs)  serve  small  towns  and  some  villages.3 These are \nprivate  entrepreneurs  who  have  set  up  small,  usually  second-hand,  petrol-  or  diesel-fueled \ngenerating  sets,  which  supply  up  to  a  few  hundred  local  residents  and  small  commercial \nestablishments. Estimates indicate that Cambodia has 600 REEs, although comprehensive data \nare  not  available.  Many  REEs  provide  a  service  to  re-charge  automotive  batteries,  which \nresidents  beyond  the  reach  of  wired  systems  use  to  supply  domestic  electricity.  The  cost of \nenergy  from  batteries  is  generally  more  than  $1/kWh.  Where  no  REE  service  is  provided,  the \nmore prosperous residents and entrepreneurs have their own small petrol generators. Statistics \non connection rates are unreliable, but officially the national electricity ratio (i.e., the proportion \nof  households  connected  to  a  wired  supply)  is  estimated  to  be  about  15%.  Currently  REEs \noperate  under  difficult  business  conditions,  with  limited  access  to  capital  and  an  uncertain \nregulatory  environment  that  results  in  tariffs  that  are  higher  than  EDC\u2019s  provincial  tariffs.  This \nmeans  that  many  poor  consumers  find  the  costs  of  electricity  to  be  beyond  their  reach.  This \nconstrains demand, with consequent implications for rural development and poverty reduction. \nDetails of external assistance to the electricity sector are in Appendix 3. \n\n                                                 \n3 REEs include small private providers in urban areas. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\nMIME\u2019s  Energy  General  Directorate  is  responsible  for  coordinating  electricity  sector \n9. \npolicy  and  planning.  To  implement  policy  as  it  relates  to  the  power  sector,  in  January  1999 \nMIME published its power sector strategy for the period up to 2016 and updated the strategy in \n2000.  In  2001,  the  Government  promulgated  the  new  Electricity  Law  of  Cambodia,  which \ndefines the management and regulation of activities in relation to the supply and consumption of \nelectricity.  One  of  the  main  purposes  of  the  law  was  to  establish  the  Electricity  Authority  of \nCambodia (EAC) as an autonomous public agency to regulate electricity service and to govern \nthe relationship between the delivery, receipt, and use of electricity. The law stipulates that it is \nEAC\u2019s responsibility to set tariffs to ensure that consumers will benefit from the proposed lower \ncosts of supply and will be protected from monopolistic pricing.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nEconomic  growth  will  only  be  sustained  if  Cambodia\u2019s  industry  becomes  more \ncompetitive.  The  high  cost  of  electricity  has  been  identified  by  the  Government  as  a  barrier  to \nincreased  competitiveness.  From  a  national  perspective,  the  electricity  sector  suffers  from \nseveral  basic  deficiencies,  namely:  (i)  the  high  tariffs  for  all  consumers  regardless  of  supplier;   \n(ii)  the  limited  extent  of  wired  system  coverage;  and  (iii)  the  high  up-front  costs  for  new \nconsumers, which particularly affect the poor.  \n \nInspite of its high tariffs, EDC\u2019s financial performance has been weak, mostly because of \n11. \nthe persistent nonpayment of electricity bills by the Government and the Government\u2019s inaction \non adjusting tariffs to a level that would permit EDC to meet its annual revenue requirements. \nEDC has not recorded a net profit in the past nine years and has accumulated losses of KR113 \nbillion ($28.3 million equivalent) during this period.  \n \n12. \nEDC\u2019s growing accounts receivable are a source of concern, as they reduce EDC\u2019s cash \nflow and its ability to cover its operational expenses, notably, fuel and power purchases. As of \nthe  end  of  July  2003,  total  accounts  receivable,  including  current  bills,  amounted  to \napproximately  KR98  billion  ($24.5  million),  of  which  Government  and  municipal  accounts \nreceivable  accounted  for  70%,  equivalent  to  4.9  months  of  average  sales,  well  above  ADB\u2019s \nloan  covenant  of  3  months  of  average  sales.  For  the  past  2  years,  EDC  has  been  forced  to \nborrow from commercial banks to finance its fuel and power purchase expenses. This process \nof  using  high-cost  commercial  debt  to  finance  operational  expenses  is  not  financially \nsustainable.  \n \nA similar accumulation of arrears occurred in 1999\u20132000. At that time, the Government \n13. \ncommitted in the Loan Agreement to (i) require ministries to establish individual contracts with \nEDC,  (ii)  have  MEF  make  direct  payments  to  EDC  for  the  ministries\u2019  electricity  bills,  and  (iii) \nhave EDC cut off defaulting ministries to prevent the accumulation of large arrears by ministries \nand ensure timely and regular payments to EDC. However, these measures were insufficient to \nensure  payment,  as  (i)  the  budget  allocation  to  ministries  has  been  insufficient  to  cover  their \ncosts,  (ii)  the  ministries  used  their  electricity  allocations  for  other  expenditures,  and  (iii)  the \nTreasury did not disburse funds in a timely manner even when bills were approved and funds \nwere  available.  Nevertheless,  the  measures  have  reduced  the  number  of  ministries  and \nmunicipalities that are in arrears and the total level of Government arrears. \n \n14. \nAs ADB requested, the Government has submitted a time-bound action plan to address \nthese issues. The action plan outlines steps to be taken by various Government agencies (MEF, \nMIME,  EAC,  and  EDC)  to  improve  EDC\u2019s  financial  position.  The  plan  includes  the  following \nremedies:  (i)  offsetting  KR48.6  billion  of  Government  and  municipal  arrears  against  EDC \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n4\n\nliabilities,  and  as  of  2004,  increasing  line  ministries\u2019  budget  allocations (which cannot be used \nfor other expenditures) to enable them to pay for their electricity consumption; (ii) having MEF \nrefund  EDC  KR40.3  billion  of  VAT  paid  for  inputs,  and  subsidizing  EDC  for  future  VAT \nassessments until the VAT law can be changed; (iii) having EAC agree to examine the structure \nand  levels  of  EDC\u2019s  tariffs  and  to  consider  an  automatic  adjustment  mechanism  to  reflect \nchanges in the costs of fuel and foreign exchange; and (iv) reducing operating costs by having \nEDC  procure  its  fuel  supply  competitively,  improve  the  merit  dispatch  order  of  generation \nstations, convert an existing generation unit to heavy fuel oil, rationalize its 5-year staffing plan, \nand attempt to renegotiate PPAs with existing IPPs once new supply is commissioned in  early \n2005. These combined measures should improve EDC\u2019s overall financial position and reduce its \naccounts  receivable  to  below  the  covenanted  level  of  3  months.  EDC  has  agreed  to  submit \nquarterly  progress  reports  on  its  collections,  and  should  receivables  begin  to  increase,  ADB, \nEDC, and MEF will review the payment mechanism.  \n \n15. \nAnother factor contributing to high tariffs is that the cost of electricity from existing IPPs \nis higher than EDC\u2019s own generating costs. The 2001 Electricity Law requires that private sector \nparticipation should result from transparent, competitive processes; however as a private power \npolicy is still in a draft stage, competition is not mandatory at this time so the IPP contracts were \nnot awarded as a result of competitive bidding. Whether the contracts entered into are the most \nadvantageous arrangement for EDC is therefore not clear. Some concerns have arisen that the \nGovernment may enter into contracts for new supplies that would conflict with the optimum use \nof the project transmission line. Therefore, as a result of policy dialogue, the Government has \ngiven  an  assurance  that  it  will  not  enter  into  any  new  IPP  contracts  for  supplies  that  are  not \nincluded in the current least-cost plan for generation expansion without discussion with ADB.  \n \n16. \nEDC\u2019s contract with a new IPP that will take effect in 2005 will help reduce its average \ncost of generation in the short term and overcome some supply constraints.4 Therefore EDC will \nbe  able  to  continue  to  increase  electricity  sales  in  2004\u20132006.  This  will  reduce  some  of  the \nfinancial  pressure  on  tariffs  and  help  EDC  meet  its  operating  expenses  in  the  short  term. \nFinancial  analysis  has  determined  that  EDC\u2019s  existing  tariffs  are  sufficient  to  ensure  that  its \nconsolidated  revenues  meet  its  operating  expenses  during  this  period.  Its  revenues  are  also \nsufficient to meet minimum debt-service coverage ratios. However, EDC will continue to sustain \nnet  losses  because  of  interest  expenses  and  taxes  until  the  transmission  line  has  been \ncommissioned  and  supply  is  sufficient  to  facilitate  sales  growth.  Appendix  4  provides  details \nabout EDC\u2019s financial performance and projections.  \n \nEDC  needs  additional  sources  of  supply  at  lower  cost,  such  as  imports  from  Viet  Nam \n17. \nvia  a  transmission  line.  This  will  initiate  a  virtuous  cycle  of  lower  costs  that  will  allow  EDC  to \nbecome financially viable and enable it to invest to meet growing demand, thereby reducing the \npressure to increase tariffs to achieve a reliable electricity supply and encouraging companies \nthat currently operate their own generators to switch to EDC\u2019s system. Thus as demand grows, \nEDC  will  be  able  to  generate  power  from  larger,  more  efficient  generating  units  or  purchase \npower from IPPs, and will eventually be able to reduce tariffs to a level that is competitive in the \nregion.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4 EDC has signed an 18-year PPA with Khmer Electric Power Corp. for a supply of 32 MW capacity at an average \ncost of 8.1 cents/kWh. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n5\n\nThe limited coverage of a wired supply is being addressed by ADB\u2019s on-going loan5 to \n18. \nrehabilitate  the  electricity  systems  in  eight  provincial  towns  and  a  follow-up  project  in  the \npipeline for 20056 to rehabilitate and expand the systems in the remaining provincial towns. The \nWorld Bank is taking the lead in rural electrification under a component of this project credit that \nwill  set  up  a  rural  electrification  fund  to  subsidize  construction  costs  for  REEs.  ADB  will \ncontribute to rural electrification through the bulk supply distribution component of this Project, \nwhich  focuses  on  villages  along  the  transmission  line  route.  The  Project  includes  capacity \nbuilding  to  encourage  REEs  to  invest  in  connections  to  end-consumers  using  the  rural \nelectrification fund. The Government has acknowledged that REEs are essential for widespread \nrural electrification. \n \n19. \nThe level of up-front costs is at least as important a factor as tariff levels in preventing \nthe poor from accessing electricity supply even when it is available, therefore the Government \nhas  reached  agreement  with  EDC  to  reduce  connection  costs.  As  a  result  of  policy  dialogue, \nEDC  has  agreed  to  introduce  a  lower  capacity,  cheaper  meter  for  new,  low-consumption \ncustomers.  Further  assessment  of  up-front  costs  will  be  conducted  under  the  Project. \nAssistance will also be provided to EDC to make its bills more consumer-friendly.  \n \n20. \nAs  early  as  1999,  MIME  was  aware  that  a  low-cost,  indigenous  source  of  generation \ncould not be economically developed in the short term. Therefore the Government  entered into \na  power  trade  agreement  with  Viet  Nam,  under  which  EDC  and  Electricity  of  Vietnam  (EVN) \nwould construct a new high-voltage transmission line linking the two countries, and EDC would \npurchase a maximum of 80 MW of power commencing in 2003, increasing to 200 MW in 2008. \nThe terms and conditions were incorporated into a power purchase agreement (PPA) signed in \n2000. The agreement will provide EDC with access to electricity at well below the cost of EDC\u2019s \nown generation or purchase from existing IPPs. Implementation of the agreement was delayed \npending Cambodia\u2019s ability to secure financing. At the request of the Government of Cambodia, \nADB  approved  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Project.7 The transmission line \nwill also benefit Viet Nam, because the assured exports to Cambodia will justify construction of \nthe  90-kilometer  (km)  line  on  the  Vietnamese  side  of  the  border  and  help  accelerate  the \nelectrification of the remote southwest area of the country. \n \nPeople  living  close  to  transmission  lines  are  often  adversely  affected,  yet  receive  no \n21. \nbenefits.  Impacts  occur  during  construction  because  of  an  influx  of  traffic  and  construction \nworkers,  and  long-lasting  impacts  are  visual  and  a  change  in  the  physical  environment \ncompared with the before project situation. These impacts may lead, if not to outright opposition \nto  the  line,  at  least  to  resentment  that  no  benefits  flow  to  those  affected.  The  Project  is \naddressing this concern by means of the bulk supply distribution component. Since the on-going \nloan  (footnote  5)  was  processed,  in  2000,  the  number  of  REEs  providing  a  simple  electricity \nsupply has increased in both rural and urban areas. Under the Project, positive action is being \ntaken  to  encourage  participation  by  REEs  along  the  transmission  line  route  by  EDC  providing \nthem with a reasonably priced, reliable supply to sell to end-consumers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2000.

This \nthe  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  \n(2003\u20132005).  The  country  strategy  and  program  update  identifies  three  priority  areas  for  ADB \nsupport,  namely  rural  economic  development,  human  resources  development,  and  private \nsector development. The proposed project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s \nstrategy for the sector and with ADB\u2019s subregional strategy.  \n \nPrevious projects in the power sector  in Cambodia have required minimal resettlement. \n23. \nHowever,  on  a  number  of  road  projects,  poorly  implemented  resettlement  plans  have  led  to \nsignificant  delays  and  hardships  for  the  very  people  who  should  have  benefited  from  the \ndevelopment  interventions.  Furthermore,  the  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  has \nbeen inadequate to address these deficiencies, thus the Project has been designed to ensure \nthat  the  significant  resettlement  required  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan.  The  project  implementation  consultants  (PICs)  will  include  international  and \ndomestic  specialists  who  will  coordinate  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  will  hire \nand supervise the independent monitoring organization. A separate technical assistance project \nis  in  the  pipeline  for  2004  to  develop  a  national  resettlement  policy,  a  decree,  and  technical \nguidelines as well as to provide capacity building.8 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  first  of  the  Project\u2019s  two  objectives  is  to  promote  the  provision  of  sustainable  and \n24. \nreliable electricity at affordable prices to consumers in Phnom Penh and along the transmission \ncorridor.  This  will  be  achieved  by  facilitating  the  importation  of  up  to  1,490  gigawatt-hours \n(GWh) of electricity per year by constructing a 200 MW capacity high-voltage transmission line \nfrom  the  Vietnamese  border  to  Phnom  Penh.  The  border  price  will  average  $0.06/kWh (or a \ndelivered  price  to  the  medium-voltage  system  in  Phnom  Penh  of  $0.078/kWh,  which  includes \nlosses, operation and maintenance, and all taxes). This will provide urgently needed additional \nreliable capacity. This facility will provide a sustainable and reliable electricity supply at a lower \ncost  than  any  alternative,  will  improve  EDC\u2019s  financial  position,  and  will  eventually  ease \npressure  for  tariff  increases.  Electricity  will  also  be  supplied  to  Takeo  township  and  to  rural \nvillages and communities close to the proposed transmission line that are currently not serviced.  \n \nThe  second  purpose  is  to  enhance  accessibility  to  power  by  the  poor  by  promoting  a \n25. \npro-poor  policy  environment  in  the  sector.  This  will  be  achieved  through  a  number  of capacity \nbuilding components. Currently the lowest capacity connection and meter in Phnom Penh is 10 \namperes, which is well in excess of the requirements of poor households. EDC has committed \nto  making  a  lower-cost,  5-ampere  connection  available  to  low-use customers in Phnom Penh, \nand EDC is willing to allow customers to amortize the connection costs over a 10-month period \nas it has in the provinces.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and Capacity Building for $400,000. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n7\n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure Component \n\nThe  project  area  consists  of  the  provinces  of  Takeo  and  Kampong  Speu  and  the \n26. \nmunicipality  of  Phnom  Penh.  The  Project  will  link  to  a  similar  project  in  Viet  Nam  to  allow  the \nimportation  of  power  from  Viet  Nam.  The  proposed  route  for  the  transmission  line  is  on  the \nBassac River floodplain, which forms part of the Mekong lowlands. The entire route is flat, and \nseasonal flooding occurs over an estimated 60% of the route, with flood levels up to 3.5 meters \nat  the  southern  end.  The  project  area  has  a  monsoon-dominant climate, with one distinct wet \nand  dry  season  each  year.  The  route  traverses  a  total of 15 districts, 37 communes, and 120 \nvillages.  Settlements  are  characterized  by  villages  of  50  to  250  households  located  on  land \nmarginally  higher  than  surrounding  paddy  fields,  either  on  an  isolated  feature  or  along \nroadsides. Takeo, with a (population of 39,000, is the only large township within the vicinity of \nthe  route,  excluding  Phnom  Penh.  Approximately  95%  (365  hectares)  of  the  right-of-way  is \nprivately  owned  land,  but  few  landholders  actually  hold  any  form  of  land  title  because  of \nCambodia\u2019s recent history. The average rural landholding size is 0.4 hectare, with most holdings \nconsisting of a house block and paddy area. \n  \n27. \nThe  infrastructure  component  of  the  Project  will  consist  of  a  high-voltage transmission \nsystem comprising a 220 kV double-circuit transmission line connecting to 115 kV lines that will \nprovide  the  final  connection  into  Phnom  Penh.  The  109  km  of  220  kV  transmission  line  will \ngenerally run in a southerly direction from Phnom Penh to the border, within 250 meters of the \nPhnom Penh-Kampot railway line to Takeo for 59 km and within 2 km of national road number 2 \nfrom  Takeo  to  the  border  for  50  km.  Substations  will  be  constructed  at  west  Phnom  Penh \n(connection of the 220 kV line to  the 115 kV line) and at Takeo. The substations will provide a \n22 kV supply to the surround areas and to villages along the transmission line route. \n \nThe  double-circuit  220  kV  transmission  line  will  comprise  conductors  hung  from  \n28. \nself-supporting steel lattice towers designed to allow for the periodic flooding prevalent along the \nproposed  route.  The  towers  are  likely  to  be  between  34  and  40  meters  high  with  an  average \nspan  of  around  350  meters.  The  conductors  will  be  selected  to  provide  each  circuit  with  a \ncapacity of 200 MW between the Vietnamese border and Takeo and of 400 MW between Takeo \nand Phnom Penh to allow for the eventual connection to Kampot. The two double-circuit 115 kV \nlines will comprise conductors of the same type used on the existing transmission line between \nsubstations GS1 and GS2. Poles will be around 21 meters high and spaced 220 meters apart, \non average. Connection to the grid will include stringing a second circuit onto the existing 115 \nkV towers around Phnom Penh. \n \n29. \nThe  project  transmission  line  will  link  to  a  new  substation  at  Chau  Doc  on  the \nVietnamese side of the border and then, via a 90 km, 220 kV transmission line, to the existing \nsubstation  at  Thot  Not.  The  World  Bank  will  finance  the  line  and  the  Chau  Doc  substation \nthrough funds reallocated from an existing International Development Association credit.9 These \nVietnamese facilities are scheduled for completion by the end of 2005 and will be used to meet \ndomestic  demand  until  the  interconnection  with  the  Project  transmission  line  is  complete  in \n2007. \n \n\n                                                 \n9 International Development Association. Transport, Distribution, and Disaster Reconstruction Credit No. 3034.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8\n\n2. \n\nBulk Supply Distribution Component  \n\n30. \nThe  project  preparation  technical  assistance  included  a  study  to  evaluate  whether \nelectrification of the villages close to the transmission line route could be included as a project \ncomponent.  A  range  of  options  was  considered  comprising  both  geographical  and  technical \nalternatives. Including the cost of possible interruptions to operation of the transmission line, the \nleast-cost option is to include villages located  within 1 km on both sides of the right-of-way and \nto  supply  each  village  with  a  22  kV  supply  using  a  single-wire,  earth-return system, which is \nsuitable for low-density loads and can be economically expanded with increasing demand. The \n22  kV  system  will  run  north  and  south  from  the  Takeo  substation  and  south  from  the  West \nPhnom Penh substation, and will thus serve the entire transmission line route. Each line will be \nwithin the economically maximum length of about 40 km. The 22 kV system will be operated by \nEDC, which will supply bulk power to a convenient point in each village. Points of distribution to \nend-users  will  be  constructed  and  operated  by  REEs,  which  will  be  selected  and  licensed  in \naccordance with EAC\u2019s procedures.10 \n \n\n3. \n\nResettlement \n\n31. \nImplementing  and  monitoring  of  the  Resettlement  Plan  is  included  in  the  project  cost. \nLand acquisition is required for the two substations and access roads, and for towers along the \ntransmission lines, affecting approximately 634 households. One hundred sixty-four of these will \nbe  severely  affected  including  15  farmers  on  sub-station  land,  and  148  houses  and  one \ncommercial enterprise that will need to be relocated. In addition approximately 7,000 productive \ntrees  will  be  cleared  from  the  ROW.  Except  for  land  required  for  towers,  the  land  within  the \nROW will continue to be used for agricultural purposes. Compensation for all lost assets will be \npaid in cash at replacement cost, and socio-economic rehabilitation measures will be provided \nto improve the resettlers\u2019 livelihoods or restore them to pre-project conditions. \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building \n\na. \n\nResident Financial Management Adviser \n\nEDC  will  retain  a  resident  financial  management  adviser  to  improve  its  financial  and \n32. \naccounting  functions  and  performance  reporting  ability.  An  additional  10  person-months  of \nconsulting services will be required during 2004 and 2005. Other major activities of the adviser \nwill  include  further  implementing  EDC\u2019s  financial  recovery  plan,  establishing  information \nsystems  in  provincial  units,  and  strengthening  EDC\u2019s  internal  audit  capability  by  providing \ntraining.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDemand Management and Consumer Services \n\n33. \nThe objective of the demand management program is to promote the efficient use and \nconservation  of  energy.  Placed  within  EDC\u2019s  public  relations  unit,  the  program  will  include \ntargeted  information  designed  to  help  consumers  with  energy  savings  options.  The  consumer \nservices  program  will  include  (i)  training  staff  in  customer  relations;  (ii)  developing  quality  and \nefficiency  standards  in  relation  to  customer  service;  (iii)  improving  coordination  with  the  repair \ndepartment  to  remedy  faults  more  quickly;  (iv)  instigating  an  information  program  to  inform \n\n                                                 \n10  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia.  2002.

The  proposed \ncapacity building will support EDC in mobilizing private providers in the Project area, help them \napply for licenses and access the capital funds necessary for investments in low-voltage supply.  \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening of Environmental Management and Social Safeguards \n\n35. \nEDC has established a social and environmental unit within the Corporate Planning and \nProjects Department. The Project will help build the capacity of this unit by financing higher-level \neducation for one social and one environmental specialist from EDC staff. \n \n\ne. \n\nImplementation Support for the Electricity Authority of Cambodia \n\n36. \nThe Project will fund an individual resident adviser to provide implementation support as \nEAC  begins  to  monitor  licensees  and  review  tariff  applications.  The  consultant\u2019s  scope  will \ninclude  designing  an  information  campaign  for  stakeholder  groups,  providing  operational and \nlogistical  support  to  EAC,  and  reviewing  initial  operational  guidelines  to  determine  their \neffectiveness. \n \n\nf. \n\nTariff Review Study of Phnom Penh Operations \n\nfinance \n\nADB  will \n\ntwo  consultants \n\nthe  services  of \n\n37. \nto  help  EDC  undertake  a \ncomprehensive review of its long-term tariff structure and rates for Phnom Penh and for those \nareas  to  be  connected  to  the  transmission  grid.  The  objective  is  to  help  EDC  determine \nappropriate tariff levels for its Phnom Penh operations to meet its financial objectives, taking into \naccount the long-run marginal cost of supply, and to address any financial cross-subsidies from \nprovincial operations. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n38. \nThe Project has several features that derive from its subregional nature. It will form the \nbasis  for  future  international  transmission  links  between  Cambodia  and  its  neighbors,  as \nenvisaged  in  the  GMS  master  plan  on  power  interconnections  (footnote  2).  In  addition  to \nproviding  Cambodia  with  its  lowest-cost  source  of  power,  the  Project  will  benefit  Viet  Nam  by \nincreasing the economic viability of the linking transmission line on the Vietnamese side of the \nborder. With the reasonably assured load of 200 MW supplied by the project transmission line to \nCambodia, it will be economic to install new generating plant and transmission systems to serve \nthe remote part of southwest Viet Nam, which would otherwise remain underserved. The Project \nalso requires the main construction contractor to help EDC operate the transmission line for the \nfirst  year  and  to  provide  structured  training  in  high-voltage operation and maintenance both in \nCambodia  and  abroad.  Power  supplied  from  Viet  Nam  will  be  sourced  from  hydroelectric  and \nconventional steam generation and from increasing use of indigenous natural gas in combined-\ncycle  thermal  plants.  This  will  defer  the  commissioning  of  additional  diesel-fired generation in \nCambodia.  Thus  the  region  will  save  on  foreign  exchange  requirements  and  reduce \nenvironmental pollution.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10\n\n \n\nThis  Project  has  two  other  interesting  features.  First,  it  combines  the  promotion  of \n39. \nsubregional  economic  growth  with  poverty  targeting  to  provide  direct  benefits  to  the  poor  by \nreducing the often prohibitively high initial connection costs. Second, the design of the Project \ncreates opportunities for private sector participation in rural electrification by providing a reliable \nsupply  of  reasonably  priced  electricity  from  EDC-owned  sources  in  each  village  along  the \ntransmission line route and investing in the distribution system for sales to end consumers. This \nwill promote the business environment at the local community level. \n \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  harmonized  the  financial  covenants  for  EDC.  The \n40. \nemphasis is on improving EDC\u2019s cash flow. This requires that covenants under the existing loan \n(ref footnote 5) be repealed to reflect the financial covenants for the Project. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n41. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $95.0  million  equivalent,  comprising  $58.5 \nmillion  equivalent  (62%)  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $36.5  million  equivalent  (38%)  in \ndomestic currency costs. The cost estimates are based on 2003 price levels for base costs and \ninclude  physical  contingencies,  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges \nduring  construction.  Physical  contingencies  have  been  estimated  at  10%  of  base  costs  and \nprice contingencies were calculated using ADB\u2019s current rates of inflation for foreign goods and \nservices. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  finance  $35.5  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the \nProject, including interest on the loan during construction, and $8.8 million of domestic currency \ncosts.  For  the  115  kV  system  grid  substations  in  Phnom  Penh,  the  World  Bank  will  provide \n$16.0 million (17% of total project costs) of  parallel cofinancing. The Nordic Development Fund \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n11\n\n(NDF) will provide \u20ac10 million (about $11 million equivalent) in cofinancing for a portion of the \nsubstation equipment, representing 12% of total project costs.

The  World  Bank  will \nprovide  cofinancing  as  part  of  its  Rural  Electrification  and  Transmission  Project.  The \nInternational  Development  Association  World  Bank  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  40  years, \nincluding a 10-year grace period, with 1% interest. The NDF loan will be denominated in euros \nand  will  have  a  maturity  of  40  years,  including  a  10-year grace period, 0.75% service charge, \nand 0.50% commitment fee on undisbursed amounts.  \n \nThe borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the proceeds of the loan will be re-\n44. \nlent  to  EDC  pursuant  to  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to \nADB. MEF will re-lend the ADB loan, excluding $300,000 plus contingencies, to EDC for a loan \nof 20 years maturity, including a 5-year grace period, at an interest rate of 4.2%. MEF will re-\nlend the World Bank and NDF loans together with its own contribution on the same terms. MEF \nwill  provide  a  grant  to  EDC  for  capacity  building  for  REEs  ($100,000  plus  appropriate \ncontingencies).  MEF  will  also  provide  a  grant  of  $200,000  plus  appropriate  contingencies  to \nEAC for capacity building. EDC agrees to bear the Government\u2019s foreign exchange risk of the \nproposed loans. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n45. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  as  well  as  the  owner  and  operator  of  the  facilities  and  the \nbeneficiary  of  most  of  the  institutional  capacity  building,  EDC  will  be  responsible  for  project \nimplementation and coordination. Two ADB-funded projects have been completed in the power \nsector,11  and  a  third  is  on-going  (ref  footnote  5).  For  both  completed  loans,  the  project \nimplementing agency was Electricit\u00e9 du Phnom Penh, EDC\u2019s predecessor, which demonstrates \nthat EDC has the capability to successfully implement similar power generation and distribution \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1992.

EDC  will  set  up  two  project  management  units    to  separately  implement  the  work \nfunded under ADB and NDF procurement guidelines and World Bank procurement guidelines. \nThe  director  of  the  Corporate  Planning  and  Projects  Department  will  head  both  project \nmanagement  units,  and  both  will  have  similar  staffing  arrangements,  including  a  project \nmanager, substation managers, and a manager for resettlement and the environment. Units will \nbe based at EDC\u2019s head office in Phnom Penh, with a site office in Takeo.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n46. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, beginning in the second quarter of 2004. \nCompletion  of  physical  works  is  expected  by  the  third  quarter  of  2007,  to  be  followed  by  a   \n9-month  period  of  training  of  EDC  staff  by  the  contractor  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \nthe  transmission  line.  Loan  closing  will  be  on  31  December  2008.  Resettlement  work  will \ncommence  shortly  after  the  appointment  of  the  PICs,  with  fieldwork  to  confirm  affected \nhouseholds  and  compensation  rates.  Resettlement  activities  associated  with  the  substations \ncan be completed relatively quickly, because the size and location of the substations is already \nknown. However, under the turnkey contract for the transmission line, the contractor will identify \nthe exact locations for the supporting steel towers only after the completion of detailed design. \nTherefore resettlement associated with tower locations cannot be completed until about month \n24. Works funded by ADB  and NDF will be coordinated with those funded by the World Bank. \nReinforcement  of  the  115  kV  ring  around  Phnom  Penh  and  the  upgrading  of  grid  substations \nand grid extensions around Phnom Penh will be completed by 2006 and will be used to expand \nand strengthen EDC\u2019s existing system. \n  \n47. \ncontinue until mid 2006. The implementation schedule is given in Appendix 6. \n \n\nCapacity  building  activities  will  commence  shortly  after  loan  effectiveness  and  will \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48. \nThe  220  kV  portion  of  the  works  will  be  undertaken  under  one  turnkey  contract  for \nconstruction  of  the  line  and  a  second  turnkey  contract  for  the  Takeo  and  West  Phnom  Penh \nsubstations. Both contracts will be awarded using international competitive bidding. Contractors \nwill  be  prequalified  using  ADB  procedures  and  the  contracts  will  be  awarded  using  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement Under ADB Loans. Preference will be given to domestic contractors \nand  domestically  manufactured  goods  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding. \nAppendix 7 provides details of procurement packages. \n \n49. \nSeveral standard pieces of electrical equipment and materials, such as the transformers \nand  capacitor  banks,  will  be  purchased  under  a  supply  of  goods  contract  in  accordance  with \nNDF procedures and will be installed by the substation turnkey contractor. The 115 kV lines and \nworks funded by the World Bank will be procured under World Bank guidelines and will interface \nwith the ADB-funded works at the boundary of the 115 kV West Phnom Penh substation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nThe services of the PICs will cover (i) preliminary design of the works, (ii) preparation of \nprequalification  and  bidding  documents,  (iii)  assistance  with  prequalification  and  tender \nevaluation,  (iv)  approval  of  contractors\u2019  detailed  designs,  (v)  supervision  of  construction  and   \n(vi)  to  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance.  The  PICs  will  include  an  international  and  a \ndomestic  resettlement  specialist  to  coordinate  all  resettlement  activities,  provide  capacity \nbuilding  for  all  agencies  involved  in  resettlement,  and  recruit  and  supervise  the  independent \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n13\n\nmonitoring organization. These activities will be included in a consulting services package with a \ntotal  of  120 person-months  (60 person-months  of  international  consultants  and  60  person-\nmonths of domestic consultants). The PICs will be engaged using ADB\u2019s advance procurement \nprocedures  so  that  survey  and  design  work  can  commence  soon  after  loan  effectiveness. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.   \nA  quality-  and  cost-based  procedure  will  be  used  for  engaging  firms  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB will be used to engage domestic consultants. Individual consultants (totaling \n35  person-months)  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  the  capacity  building  components  of  the \nProject. All consultants for the ADB-funded portion of the works will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  ADB-funded  consultants  will  handle  works \nfunded by NDF. Consultants for the World Bank-funded component will be engaged using World \nBank procedures. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nDisbursements of ADB funds under the Project will be mainly for turnkey contracts and \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. An imprest account will \nbe  used  to  purchase  small  items,  such  as  those  associated  with  the  capacity  building \ncomponents. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n52.  Within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year, EDC will submit to ADB audited project \naccounts  containing  detailed  descriptions  of  the  sources  of  receipts  and  expenditures  and \nimprest  account  statements.  Also  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  EDC  will \nsubmit  unaudited  copies  of  EDC\u2019s  consolidated  financial  statements  which  will  consist  of  an \nincome statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows and statement of changes in equity. \nEDC will submit audited copies of EDC\u2019s consolidated financial statements within 9 months of \nthe end of each fiscal year.  \n \n53. \nEDC  will  continue  its  current  practice  of  hiring  external  auditors  to  audit  its  annual \nfinancial  statements  and  project  accounts  and  to  provide  a  memorandum  on  issues  identified \nduring the audit process. These will be attached to the respective reports. For future contracts \nand  revisions,  the  auditors\u2019  terms  of  reference  will  be  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  work.  The  accounts  will  be  prepared  using  international  accounting \nstandards and the audit will be carried out using international auditing standards. The auditors \nwill be required to provide an opinion on EDC\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants and \nindicate  the  details  of  the  actual  calculations  for  all  ratios  in  conformity  with  the  definitions \ncontained in the Loan and Project agreements. \n \nProject  progress  reports  will  be  submitted  by  EDC  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The \n54. \nreports  will  include  a  description  of  (i)  the  physical  progress  of  the  Project;  (ii)  any  problems \nencountered and anticipated along with suggested corrective actions; (iii) an updated bar chart \nin  an  acceptable  format  to  show  progress,  including  progress  on  implementation  of  the \nimplementation  and \nresettlement  plan;  (iv) \nrecommendations for corrective action; and (v) a summary of financial accounts for the Project, \nincluding  project  expenditures  during  the  period  and  year-to-date and total expenditures. EDC \nwill submit a project completion report to ADB and NDF within 3 months of Project completion. \nAside from an assessment of the execution and operation of the Project, this report will indicate \ncompliance  with  the  loan  covenants  and  include  the  results  of  the  project  performance  and \nevaluation program. \n\nfor  any  delays \n\nthe  reasons \n\nin  project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14\n\n \n\n7. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nA  number  of  measurable  performance  targets  have  been  selected  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  number  of  electricity \ncustomers  and  demand  in  various  categories  will  be  monitored  using  EDC's  consumer \ndatabase, with a separate  category for poor consumers. Efficiencies in utility operations will be \nmeasured  by  data  on  electrical  losses,  sales  lost  through  breakdowns,  employee-customer \nratios,  and  average  cost  of  service.  The  degree  of  compliance  with  financial  covenants  will \nprovide  an  indication  of  EDC\u2019s  performance  throughout  the  implementation  period.  In Phnom \nPenh,  monitoring  will  include  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  demand  management \nand  consumer  services  component  of  the  Project,  particularly  with  respect  to  (i)  increasing \nconnections  to  the  poor,  (ii)  improving  responses  to  customer  complaints,  and  (iii)  repairing \nsupply breakdowns more rapidly.  \n \n56. \nPerformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  also  be  carried  out  for  the  bulk  supply \ndistribution component along the transmission line route. Within the first year of connections, a \nbaseline  survey  will  be  carried  out  to  monitor  (i)  connection  rates  among  the  poor  and  the   \nnonpoor,  (ii)  electricity  expenditures,  (iii)  up-front  charges,  (iv)  affordability  of  tariffs,  and   \n(v)  ability  of  households  to  sustain  monthly  payments.  Two  years  after  the  baseline  survey  an \nimpact  survey  will  be  carried  out  to  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  and  development \nimpacts. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nA  midterm  review,  to  be  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  will  focus  on  the \n57. \ncapacity  building,  environmental,  resettlement,  and  training  aspects  of  the  Project,  partly  to \nensure that EDC has adequate human and other resources necessary to manage the facilities \nwhen they are completed. Particular attention will be paid to progress made in selecting REEs \nfor  the  22  kV  bulk  supply  component  of  the  Project,  awarding  operating  licenses,  and  setting \nconsumer tariffs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n58. \nThe forecast demand for the transmission line analysis suggests that demand will grow \nat about 10% to 12% per year in the first five years of the Project. In the longer term, the growth \nin electricity demand will level out and remain at around 5% per year, i.e., about 1% above the \npredicted  growth  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  forecast  suggests  that  demand  will  exceed \ndistribution  capacity  in  the  period  before  the  transmission  line  has  been  commissioned.  Thus \nthere will be significant unmet electricity demand when the transmission line is operational. By \nthis time, EDC will be in a better position to connect new consumers using funds from the World \nBank credit and from savings arising from the lower-cost Khmer Electric Power IPP project due \nto  be  commissioned  in  2005.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  capacity  of  the  transmission  line \nwould be fully utilized by 2017, although the system will require new peaking capacity by 2014.  \n \nA  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  transmission  line  component  and  the  bulk \n59. \nsupply  distribution  component  (Appendix  8).  The  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  (WACCs) \nhave been estimated for both EDC and a typical private REE because of the mix of investment \nrequired  in  the  bulk  supply  distribution  component.  The  WACC  for  EDC is approximately 6%, \nbased  on  its  debt  leverage  and  access  to  multilateral  concessional  loans.  The  WACC  for  a \ntypical REE is approximately 13%, because of its more restricted access to debt and then only \nat commercial rates. The evaluation period for both components was 2004\u20132035. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\nFor  the  transmission  component,  the  analysis  assumes  that  tariffs  remain  at  the  same \n60. \naverage rate (approximately $0.15/kWh) over the life of the transmission line. After accounting \nfor the full costs of meeting additional demand via the transmission line, the Project generates a \nsignificant  net  return,  suggesting  that  it  is  viable  from  a  financial  perspective.  The  net  present \nvalue  (NPV)  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  about  KR2,506  billion  ($626.5  million),  which  is \nequivalent  to  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return    of  approximately  35%.  This  provides  a \ncomfortable financial margin above the WACC of 6%. \n \nFor  the  distribution  component,  the  assumption  is  that  electricity  will  be  supplied  to  a \n61. \ncorridor  about  1  km  wide  on  both  sides  of  the  transmission  line.  All  project  benefits  and  costs \nwere discounted at a rate equivalent to the composite WACC for EDC and a typical REE. The \ndistribution lines are assumed to be commissioned in 2007 and in service until 2035, when the \nlines  are  assumed  to  have  reached  the  end  of  their  economic  lives.  For  this  new  prospective \nservice area, to be operated by an REE, a tariff has been derived based on cost recovery that \nassumes  a  bulk  supply  tariff  from  EDC  of  $0.19/kWh  and  a  distribution  tariff  of  approximately \n$0.09/kWh.  This  bulk  rate  incorporates  the  lower  average  energy  cost  of  EDC  supply  and  the \nrecovery  of  capital  costs  of  new  22  kV  lines.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the  distribution  of \nelectricity is viable, with an NPV of KR1 million and a financial internal rate of return of 12.6% \ncompared to the composite WACC of 9.5%. \n\n  \nThe economic analysis was undertaken on the basis that the next lowest-cost alternative \n62. \nwould meet the demand that would otherwise be met by the supply from the transmission line. \nIncremental and nonincremental benefits were evaluated together with the benefits associated \nwith the increased reliability of supply that the transmission line would provide. These benefits \nwere  evaluated  against  the  costs  of  the  transmission  line,  taking  into  account  costs  related  to \ndistribution  to  end-consumers.  The  analysis  suggests  that  the  transmission  line  is  the  most \neconomically viable option and yields an NPV of $201.3 million and an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 32%.  \n \n63. \n  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  were  undertaken  with  respect  to  identified  project  risks. \nThe  results  suggest  that  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  remains  robust  with  respect  to  these \nrisks.  Analysis  of  the  institutional  risk  that  may  affect  the  utilization  of  the  transmission  line \nindicates that the load would need to fall to 135 GWh per year compared to a typical value of \n1,400 GWh/year, to reach the economic internal rate of return threshold of 12%. While this level \nis well below the import needs from 2008 onward, the PPA between Cambodia and Viet Nam \nwill  include  a  minimum  load  requirement  of  300  GWh  per  year.  This  level  of  utilization  will \nensure a comfortable margin in meeting the transmission line\u2019s economic and financial viability.  \n \n64. \nThe bulk supply distribution component will significantly reduce the current high cost of \nelectricity  and  improve  the  quality  of  supply  to  poor  communities  along  the  transmission  line \nroute. Four supply options for providing reliable electricity services to these communities were \nassessed.  The  economic  analysis  suggests  that  the  single-wire  earth-return  lines  for  the \nelectrification  of  communities  within  1  km  on  each  side  of  the  transmission  line  would  be  the \nmost  economically  viable  option.  The  component  will  electrify  14,200  households  over  the \nlifetime  of  the  Project,  of  which  5,700  are  poor,  and  yield  an  NPV  of  $5.3  million  and  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 25%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that economic viability \nis sensitive to the number of connections made by REEs.12 \n\n                                                 \n12 Takeo  Province  currently  has  14  REEs,  but  the  field  survey  found  only  two  private  providers  in  the  100  villages \n\nsurveyed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16\n\n \n\nThe distributional analysis suggests that most transmission line benefits accruing to the \n65. \npoor  will  occur  as  a  result  of  economic  growth  and  employment.  In  contrast,  most  benefits \nresulting  from  the  bulk  supply  distribution  component  will  come  from  connecting  the  poor.  A \nnecessary condition for the poor to receive these benefits will be that they can afford to connect \nand to sustain their connections. Overall, the Project yields an economic NPV of $224.4 million. \nCambodia will receive 92% of these benefits i.e. $206.6 million, comprising $201.3 million from \nthe  transmission  component  and  $5.3  million  from  the  bulk  supply  component.  The  poor  in \nCambodia will receive 15% of the Cambodian benefits, amounting to $ 31.2 million. The details \nof the economic analysis are given in Appendix 9. \n \n66. \nExisting  official  poverty  data  suggest  that  15%  of  the  population  in  Phnom  Penh  lives \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  The  number  of  poor  consumers  with EDC connections was estimated \nusing a threshold of 30 kWh/month per household. This is in line with international comparisons \nand  the  poor\u2019s  ownership  of  appliances.  Data  show  that  about  15%  of  EDC\u2019s  residential \nconsumers are poor, which implies that EDC is connecting a proportionate share of the poor in \nPhnom  Penh.  However,  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Phnom  Penh  is  likely  to  be  higher  than \nofficial statistics indicate, because many of the poor reside in squatter areas with no formal land \ntenure  and  are  not  registered  with  local  authorities.  As  a  consequence,  EDC  is  unable  to \nconnect these consumers directly. Instead, these poor are connected through wholesalers and \npay tariffs well above the lifeline tariff.  \n \n67. \nPoor  households  may  face  difficulties  in  meeting  the  up-front  costs  associated  with \nconnection. To address this barrier for the poor, EDC will offer lower-capacity connections at 5 \namperes instead of 10 amperes to better accommodate the low consumption levels of the poor. \nThis would reduce up-front charges, including connection fees and consumption deposits, from \nabout  $29  to  $  14.  In  addition,  EDC  will  carry  out  an  in-depth  assessment  on  the  need  for \nallowing up-front charges to be paid in installments.  \n \nThe  transmission  line  will  allow  EDC  to  expand  the  electricity  distribution  network  in \n68. \nPhnom  Penh  to  surrounding  areas  and  to  offer  a  more  reliable  supply.  This  is  likely  to \nsignificantly  increase  the  number  of  industrial,  manufacturing,  and  commercial  consumers \nconnected to  EDC\u2019s  grid.  A  cheaper  and  more  reliable  source  of  electricity  would  allow  these \nsectors  to  compete  better  in  international  markets  and  to  expand  production.  These  sectors\u2019 \nincreased  ability  to  compete  is  particularly  important  given  Cambodia\u2019s  entry  into  the World \nTrade  Organization,  which  requires  a  phasing  out  of  preferential  trading  arrangements.  The \nmanufacturing sector is an important source of wage income for the poor in Phnom Penh and \nfor remittances to rural areas. Continued expansion of this sector would probably be important \nfor absorbing a growing labor force, especially those with lower education levels. The expansion \nof other industrial activities based on agriculture would also be important for poverty reduction, \nas it directly links to demand for agricultural produce and the incomes of the rural poor.  \n \n69. \nA detailed rural socioeconomic survey of possible project beneficiaries of the bulk supply \ndistribution  component  indicates  that  poverty  in  the  area  is  widespread,  ranging  from  25%  to \n75%.  Providing  rural  poor  households  with  electricity  from  the  transmission  line  will  result  in  a \nroughly  25%  decrease  in  expenditure  on  electricity.  This  is  despite  a  substantial  increase  in \nconsumption,  which  would  result  from  increased  reliability,  quality,  and  a  24-hour  supply.  A \nreliable  supply  of  electricity  is  expected  to  increase  economic  activity  and  have  a  generally \npositive welfare impact. Appendix 10 provides details of the social and poverty analysis.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\nThe Project will cause significant involuntary resettlement. It will use paddy land for two \n70. \nsubstations  and  take  over  land  occupied  by  productive  trees.  The  impact  has  been  minimized \nby routing the transmission line away from built-up areas. Transmission line right-of-way will be \npermanently cleared of structures and trees, but only the small areas under each tower and pole \nwill be permanently acquired. The rest of the right-of-way will remain the property of the current \nlandowner,  who  will  be  able  to  maintain  its  current  use.  Transmission  line  alignments \ndetermined  during  the  feasibility  study  will  be  fine-tuned  during  detailed  design  and  finalized \nduring  project  implementation.  Adequate  compensation,  relocation  assistance,  and  income \nrestoration  measures  have  been  designed  to  restore  lost  incomes  and  living  standards.  A \nsummary  resettlement  plan  is  given  in  Appendix  11  and  the  full  resettlement  plan  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  assessed  as  falling  into  environment  category  B.  A  summary  of \n71. \nthe  initial  environmental  examination  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  Project  are  unlikely  to  have  any  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. A low-impact route has been selected for the transmission line, with an \nemphasis on avoiding settlements, minimizing line length, and providing easy access to the line \nfor construction and maintenance. By generally following the Phnom Penh-Kampot railway from \nWest  Phnom  Penh  to  Takeo  then  national  road  2  to  the  Viet  Nam  border,  the  route  avoids \nsignificant biophysical and socioeconomic impacts. The bulk distribution component will have a \nminimal impact because the 22 kV lines will be mounted on wooden poles located on the public \neasement  for  existing  roads.  Small  (5  meter  x  5  meter)  areas  of  land  will  be  required  for \nsubstation  construction,  and  any  impacts  will  be  fully  compensated  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement  plan.  The  initial  environmental  examination  provides  specific  mitigation  measures \nand  environmental  monitoring  requirements  and  an  environmental  management  plan.  It  also \nincludes  a  requirement  for  the  executing  agency  to  prepare  a  detailed  environmental \nmanagement plan prior to construction and outlines the institutional arrangements necessary for \nconducting and monitoring the implementation of the environmental management plan. \n \n72. \nkey risks and mitigation measures include the following:  \n \n\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  minimize  economic,  social,  and  financial  risks.  The \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAdditional  generating  or  transmission  capacity  could  be  constructed  within \nCambodia  and/or  EVN  may  not  make  the  necessary  capacity  and  energy \navailable to Cambodia as and when required. As a result of policy dialogue, EDC \nhas  agreed  to  strengthen  the  PPA  with  EVN  to  ensure  that  the  necessary \ncapacity  and  energy  will  be  available,  has  committed  to  importing  at  least  300 \nGWh  of  energy  annually,  has  provided  its  current  generation  expansion  plan  to \nADB, and has agreed to discuss any deviations from the plan with ADB prior to \ncommitting to any new projects. \nConstruction  delays  could  occur  on  the  Vietnamese  and/or  Cambodian  parts  of \nthe transmission line. EVN has committed to finalize construction by 2006, well in \nadvance  of  the  commissioning  date  for  the  project  transmission  line,  and  the \nimplementation schedule for the Cambodian component is realistic. \n\n(iii)  Problems  may  arise  because  of  the  lack  of  private  sector  providers  for  the \ndistribution  component.  Moreover,  private  providers  may  not  be  able  to  finance \nthe necessary capital requirements. Mitigation factors include support to potential \nprivate  providers  throughout  the  process  of  applying  for  licenses  with  EAC  and \napplying  for  subsidized  funds  from  the  rural  electrification  fund.  Should  these \nthis  component  can  be  scaled  back  with \nmeasures  be  unsuccessful, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation  commencing  with  the  potentially  most  profitable  areas  close  to \nPhnom Penh and Takeo. \nTariffs  and  connection  charges  may  not  provide  sufficient  incentives  for  large-\nscale  consumers  to  switch  from  their  own  power  sources  to  EDC\u2019s  supply. \nHowever,  the  Project  will  allow  EDC  to  maintain  lower  tariffs  than  would  have \nbeen  the  case  without  the  Project.  In  addition,  consultants  will  carry  out  a  tariff \nreview  that  will  help  EDC  to  price  tariffs  and  connection  charges  properly  to \nensure connections. \nCompensation,  resettlement,  and  income  restoration  measures  may  not  be \ndelivered  as  agreed,  thereby  impoverishing  affected  people  and  delaying  the \ncommencement of civil works. The PICs will include specialists that will help EDC \nimplement  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  PICs  will  engage  the  independent \nmonitoring organization. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n73. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\nFinancial matters: \n(a) \n\nAll  financial  calculations  and  ratios  shall  be  applied  in  respect  of  EDC\u2019s \noperations  on  a  consolidated  basis.

The  costs  of \nincreased  high-voltage  transmission  lines  would  be  outweighed  by  reduced  new  generating \ncapacity  due  to  noncoincidence  of  peak  loads  and  shared  reserve  margins.  Operating  costs \nwould  be  reduced  least-cost  dispatch  on  a  regional  (rather  than  a  national)  basis,1  reliability \nwould be increased, and greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced. \n \nB. \n\nCambodia\u2019s Energy Sector \n\n3. \nCambodia has two indigenous sources of energy, i.e., biomass, which provides 85% of \ncurrent energy consumption, and hydropower, which is still largely undeveloped. A 1-megawatt \n(MW)  hydropower  plant  serves  Banlung,  the  capital  of  Rattanakiri  Province  and  the  12  MW \nKirirom hydropower plant, which was rehabilitated in 2001, is located about 120 kilometers west \nof  Phnom  Penh.  Imported  petroleum  products  supply  the  balance  of  energy  demand.2  The \nconsumption  of  primary  energy  for  domestic  and  light  industry,  transport,  and  electricity \nproduction is 87%, 9%, and 4%, respectively.  \n \n4. \nThe major energy source nationwide is fuelwood, which most people, especially in rural \nareas,  use  for  cooking.  Nonelectrified  households  use  kerosene  for  lighting,  mainly  in  the \ncountryside,  and  for  cooking  in  urban  areas.  The  number  of  liquefied  petroleum  gas  stoves  is \n                                                 \n1   Indigenous natural gas is used for power generation in Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Hydropower has been \ndeveloped, and significant potential exists in Myanmar, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Yunan Province. All these sources  \ndo, or can, provide energy at low cost than can be produced in Cambodia.  \n\n2   Despite  concerted  exploration  efforts,  no  oil  reserves  have  been  found  in  Cambodia.  One  company  has  a \nconcession to drill at greater depths areas already unsuccessfully explored, and gas has recently been discovered \nin undetermined quantities. \n\n \n\n1. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbelieved  to  be  increasing in Phnom Penh, but the cost of gas cylinders and new stoves is an \nimpediment  to  widespread  proliferation  of  this  relatively  clean  fuel.  Liquefied  petroleum  gas \nrepresents only about 0.2 % of national energy requirements. \n \nC. \n\nElectricity Subsector \n\n5. \nThe Asian Development Bank recommenced lending to Cambodia in 1992, and initially \nfocused on providing emergency generating and distribution facilities in Phnom Penh.3 This was \nfollowed  by  the  rehabilitation  of  electricity  systems  in  parts  of  Phnom  Penh  and  the  two \nimportant  provincial  towns  of  Sihanoukville  and  Siem  Reap.4  An  on-going  loan,  approved  in \n2000, will expand and replace the inadequate electricity generation and distribution systems in \neight other provincial capitals.  \n \nD. \n\nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n\n6. \nElectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC)  is  a  state-owned  corporation  jointly  owned  by  the \nMinistry of Industry, Mines, and Energy and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Its board of \ndirectors, which meets  each  month,  is  made  up  of  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry, \nMines, and Energy; the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and the Ministry of Justice along with \nthe  managing  director  of  EDC,  two  private  sector  representatives,  and  one  representative of \nEDC\u2019s  employees.  The  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy  representative  acts  as  the \nboard\u2019s chair. EDC prepares annual corporate plans and budgets. \n \n7. \nEDC  is  increasing  its  responsibility  for  power  supply  in  the  provinces.  It  assumed \nresponsibility for the power systems in Sihanoukville, Siem Reap, and Kompong Cham in 1999. \nIn  2000,  it  assumed  control  of  existing  systems  in  Takeo  and  Battambang  and  will  own  and \noperate  the  systems  in  eight  other  provincial  capitals  that  are  being  rehabilitated  under  Asian \nDevelopment Bank financing. \n \n8. \nPhnom  Penh,  which  has  a  population  of  about  1  million,  has  the  only  relatively  large \npower  system  in  the  country  and  accounts  for  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity consumption. \nEDC\u2019s power system in Phnom Penh serves about 150,000 consumers with a peak demand of \naround 100 MW. It has about 52 MW of diesel plants and purchases up to 57 MW of power from \ntwo  independent  power  producers.  In  September  2003,  EDC  signed  a  power  purchase \nagreement  with  a  third  independent  power  producer,  the  Khmer  Electric  Power  Company,  for \nsupply from a 32 MW heavy fuel oil fired plant. \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1992.

It \n1. \nhas not made a profit in the past 9 years and during that time has accumulated losses of KR113 \nbillion. This is primarily because tariffs have been insufficient to cover the variable cost of supply \nand  other  operating  inputs.  The  situation  improved  with  tariff  increases in 1999 and 2000, but \nsince  then  EDC  has  not  earned  sufficient  revenue  to  record  a  return  on  invested  capital  or  a \nprofit.  Financial  performance  has  been  further  adversely  affected  by  the  slow  collection  of \naccounts receivable from Government departments and from municipalities.  \n \nSince  1994,  EDC\u2019s  sales  have  grown  from  82  gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 418 GWh, yet  \n2. \ndespite  this  fivefold  growth  in  sales  volume,  EDC  did  not  recorded  a  profit.  This  is  because \ntariffs  have  been  insufficient  to  cover  revenue  requirements.  Returns  on  average  net  fixed \nassets are low (0.7% in 2002), but have improved from the negative returns experienced prior to \nthe tariff increases allowed in 1999 and 2000, which also promoted some improvement in gross \nmargins. This enabled EDC to record an operating profit of around KR7 billion for the first time \nin 2002; however, this was reduced to a net loss by interest expenses of KR13 billion. In 2001 \nand  2002,  tariffs  were  sufficient  to  allow  EDC  to  barely  recover  the  cost  of  supply,  but  still \nprovided no return on capital. \n \n3. \nSales  to  Government  ministries  and  departments  account  for  around  13%  of  revenue. \nSome ministries currently take longer than 7 months to pay their bills.  The collection cycle has \ndeteriorated  significantly  in  the  last  18  months,  despite  an  action  plan  to  address  the  problem \ndevised  in  2000.  Table  A4.1  shows  the  ageing  of  accounts  receivable  balances  as  of  \n31 December 2002. \n \n\nTable A4.1: Aged Accounts Receiv able as of 31 December 2002  \n(KR billion) \n \n\nCustomer Category \nGovernment, \nMunicipal \nCommercial, Hotel \nResidential \nForeign Nationals  \nIndustry, MV \nOther \n     Total \nMV = medium voltage. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \n\n> 90 Days \n47 \n2 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n7 \n59 \n\n60\u201390 Days \n3 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n4 \n\n30\u201360 Days \n3 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n5 \n\n< 30 Days \n5 \n2 \n5 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n18 \n\nTotal \n58 \n4 \n6 \n1 \n4 \n13 \n86 \n\n \n4. \nCash shortfalls arising from the poor collection rate are requiring EDC to resort to short-\nterm  borrowing  from  local  commercial  banks  at  high  interest  rates  (approximately  13%  per \nyear).  These  short-term  borrowing  arrangements  contravene  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  negative  pledge  requirement  that  no  other  lender  shall  have  a \npriority  claim  over  EDC\u2019s  assets.  EDC\u2019s  total  accounts  receivable  balance  grew  from  \nKR54 billion in 2000 to KR111 billion in 2003.   \n \nDebt-service  coverage  ratios  were  acceptable  in  1999  and  2000  (1.8  and  3.0, \n5. \nrespectively),  but  have  declined  since  then.  EDC  had  no  effective  debt-service  coverage  in \n2002,  as  its  net  income  before  interest  expense  was  negative.  From  a  historical  perspective, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n27\n\nthis  is  not  a  serious  problem,  because  EDC  has  not  accumulated  much  long-term debt and is \nstill  evolving  into  a  mature  utility  with  a  consistent  and  stable  revenue  base.  While  cash  flow \nissues may constrain EDC\u2019s ability to service its debt somewhat, it is not overextended from a \nbalance  sheet  perspective.  The  long-term  debt-equity  ratio  was  only  0.5  at  the  end  of  2002 \ndespite the continued erosion of equity from accumulating losses. While this balance erodes as \nadditional debt is incurred, this trend is not an immediate concern in relation to EDC\u2019s solvency. \n \n6. \nEDC\u2019s  revenue  requirements consist of the cost of supply (fuel and power purchases), \noperating  costs,  and  an  allowance  for  return  of  capital  invested  in  plant  and  equipment \n(depreciation). A return on capital is added to provide a rate of return on the equity invested in \nthe business by the Government and to meet interest payments. In this instance, a rate of return \nof  6.5%  to  net  fixed  assets  has  been  applied.  Tariffs  have  historically  never  been  sufficient to \nallow EDC to earn any return on capital. Table A4.2 shows that EDC\u2019s tariffs have consistently \nfallen short of revenue requirements, which include a 6.5% return on capital. \n \n\nTable A4.2: Electricit\u00e9 Du Cambodge\u2019s (Phnom Penh System)  \nRevenue Requirements and Tariffs, 1998\u20132002 \n(KR billion) \n\nItem \nFuel Cost \nPower Purchase Costs  \nOther Operating Costs  \nDepreciation \nReturn on Capital (6.5%) \nTotal Revenue Requirement \nAverage Retail Tariffs (KR/kWh) \nTariff Surplus (Shortfall) \n\nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \n \n\n1998 \n  177 \n  218 \n  116 \n  53 \n  49 \n  613 \n  371 \n-65% \n\n1999 \n  124 \n  269 \n  85 \n  55 \n  59 \n  591 \n  493 \n-20% \n\n2000 \n  163 \n  311 \n  95 \n  61 \n  76 \n  706 \n  570 \n-24% \n\n2001 \n  76 \n  378 \n  73 \n  65 \n  61 \n  653 \n  588 \n-11% \n\n2002 \n  89 \n  361 \n  82 \n  66 \n  63 \n  661 \n  589 \n-12% \n\nTable  A4.2  also  shows  EDC\u2019s  increasing  reliance  on  power  purchased  from  three \n7. \nindependent power producers (IPPs) since 1998. Note that EDC purchases the fuel for the IPPs \n(which merely convert the fuel into power), so that EDC bears all increases in fuel prices.  \n \n8. \nUntil EDC can regularly adjust tariffs to reflect fuel price changes, it is unlikely to earn a \nconsistent return on its invested capital. However, EDC\u2019s provincial operations initially set tariffs \nat cost-recovery levels, which does strengthen its consolidated revenue base. In addition, EDC \nhas signed an agreement for 32 megawatts (MW) of new supply priced at 8.1 cents/kWh, which \nis  well  below  current  IPP  prices.  This  will  lower  the  average  cost  of  generation  beginning  in \n2005. As indicated in table A4.3, until 2010, EDC\u2019s consolidated revenues will cover its essential \noperational expenses (excluding any return on capital).  \n \n\nTable A4.3: Forecast Revenue Requirements and Tariffs, 2003\u20132013 (Consolidated) \n(KR billion) \n \n2006 \n164 \n301 \n68 \n74 \n607 \n641 \n\n2011 \n89 \n408 \n56 \n53 \n605 \n660 \n\n2007 \n71 \n407 \n53 \n71 \n602 \n645 \n\n2005 \n72 \n423 \n55 \n69 \n619 \n633 \n\n2003 \n113 \n386 \n60 \n71 \n631 \n579 \n\n2004 \n163 \n334 \n58 \n61 \n615 \n624 \n\n2009 \n81 \n405 \n54 \n60 \n599 \n653 \n\n2010 \n87 \n405 \n55 \n56 \n602 \n658 \n\n2008 \n74 \n405 \n53 \n64 \n597 \n648 \n\n2012 \n88 \n412 \n56 \n50 \n606 \n661 \n\nItem \nFuel Cost \nPower Purchase Costs  \nOther Operating Costs  \nDepreciation \nTotal Revenue Requirement \nForecast Average Tariffs (KR/kWh) \nKWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff.  \n\n2013 \n85 \n418 \n57 \n48 \n607 \n660 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nProjected Performance \n\nfinancial  performance  (detailed \n\nTable  A4.4  presents  EDC\u2019s  projected \n\nIn the medium term, the transmission line will substantially reduce EDC\u2019s average cost \n9. \nof supply to the extent that revenue requirements from 2008 onward are well below tariff levels. \nAt this point, EDC will be able to consider reducing its retail tariffs, while still earning a profit and \nexpanding its system in provincial areas as well as in Phnom Penh.  \n \n10.  While  retail  tariffs  in  Phnom  Penh  are  high  relative  to  those  in  other  developed  urban \nsystems in Asia, tariffs in the provinces are much higher because of the systems\u2019 small size and \nisolated  nature.  The  regulator,  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC)  has  indicated  that \ntariffs  for  Phnom  Penh  (and  those  areas  eventually  to  be  connected  to  the  Phnom  Penh \ntransmission grid, such as Kampong Speu and Takeo) will be evaluated separately from EDC\u2019s \nprovincial  units,  with  the  objective  that  tariffs  should  be  set  at  a  level  that  makes  each \nindependent  operation  self-sustaining.  EDC\u2019s  consolidated  revenue  indicates  that  it  covers  its \noperational expenses, but this masks the tariff disparities. The disparity between tariffs in EDC\u2019s \ndifferent  service  areas  will  need  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  equitable  rates  based  on  EAC\u2019s \nguidelines. This process will be enhanced through ADB\u2019s separate technical assistance to EAC \nto establish a clear and transparent tariff-setting methodology. \n \nB. \n \nfinancial \n11. \nstatements are provided in Supplementary Appendix E). The base case financial forecasts show \nEDC  making  moderate  losses  over  the  next  five  years.  This  is  because  tariffs  barely  cover \noperational  expenses  and  operating  profits  are  insufficient  to  cover  interest  expenses,  foreign \nexchange  losses,  and  taxes  or  to  earn  any  return  on  capital.  Once  the  transmission  line  has \nbeen  commissioned in 2007, performance will improve dramatically. EDC\u2019s cost of supply will \nbe  reduced  by  the  lower  cost  of  imported  power  and  it  will  be  able  to  meet  demand  that  will \nremain unsatisfied until 2008 because of supply constraints. \n \n12. \nBase  case  financial  forecasts  have  been  developed  for  EDC  using  assumptions  that \nADB  believes  represent  the  most  likely  outcome  given  EDC\u2019s  current  circumstances  and \noutlook.  Demand  forecasts  for  Phnom  Penh  are  according  to  those  discussed  in  Appendix  9 \n(based  on  historical  growth  trends  and  forecasts  prepared by EDC); however, demand will be \nsomewhat  constrained  during  2004\u20132007  because  of  EDC\u2019s  supply  limitations.  Once  the \ntransmission line is commissioned, supply should be sufficient to meet all demand. Phnom Penh \ntariffs are assumed to remain unchanged, although the average tariff changes to reflect different \ngrowth rates in various customer categories. Further increases occur in provincial unit tariffs as \nprovided  for  in  the  EDC  branch  expansion  plan.  While  projections  after  2008  indicate  the \npotential for tariff reductions, no changes have been assumed at this time. \n \nIn  Phnom  Penh,  an  additional  32  MW  of  capacity  is  expected  in  2005,  but  a  shortfall \n13. \noccurs  in  relation  to  anticipated  demand  in  2004\u20132006,  before  the  Viet  Nam  line  is \ncommissioned.  The  transmission  line  is  assumed  to  be  operational  from  the  start  of  2007. \nBased  on  the  power  purchase  agreement,  the  average  purchase  price  from  Viet  Nam  will  be \n7.82 cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh). For the forecast period up to 2016 new capacity will be provided \nby Kam Chai Hydroelectric Project from 2014 at an estimated cost of supply of $0.06/kWh. The \ninternational  price  of  crude  oil  affects  both  EDC\u2019s  fuel  cost  and  the  cost  of  power  purchases. \nThe  base  case  assumes  a  price  of  $25  per  barrel  for  the  forecast  period  ($30  in  2003).  It \nincorporates  the  fuel  price  reductions  (8.70  cents/KWh  to  5.52  cents/KWh)  achieved  by \nconverting EDC\u2019s C6 unit (18 MW) to heavy fuel and future plans to convert EDC\u2019s C5 unit (10 \nMW)  to  heavy  fuel  in  late  2005.  Sales volume  will  continue  to  grow  rapidly  over  the  next  10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n29\n\nRisks and Sensitivities \n\nyears, particularly following completion of the  transmission line in 2007. Sales will reach 1,876 \nGWh  in  2013  compared  with  532  GWh  in  2003.  EDC  will  face  a  number  of  challenges  to \nachieve this growth.  \n \nADB  will  apply  a  revenue  break-even  covenant  and  debt-service  coverage  ratio,  debt-\n14. \nequity  ratio,  and  accounts  receivable  covenants  beginning  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2004.  The  debt-\nservice coverage ratio is at 1.5 (the lowest point) in 2004, and then remains at or above 1.8 for \nthe  remainder  of  the  forecast  period.  However,  the  sufficiency  of  internal  funds  generated  to \nservice  debt,  particularly  between  2003  and  2006,  is  heavily  dependent  on  improving  and \nmaintaining  the  collection  of  Government  and  municipal  accounts  receivable.  Minimum \ncovenants have been set for the short term (FY 2004 until FY 2008) until the transmission line is \nfully operational and EDC should have 10 to 12 months of operating data to evaluate. Once the \ntransmission line is fully operational, EDC and ADB will review the covenants to determine more \nappropriate performance measures based on profitability, self-financing a higher percentage of \ninvestments,  and  issuing  some  dividends  to  the  Government.  These  covenants  have  required \nthat certain financial covenants be included in Loan 1794-CAM(SF): Provincial Power Supplies \nbe repealed. \n \nC. \n \n15.  With the commissioning of a new IPP in 2005, EDC assumes it can connect several key \nindustrial and commercial customers, resulting in sales growth of 12% in 2005 and 16% in 2006. \nShould this IPP not materialize, EDC\u2019s growth will be constrained to 10% in 2005, and operation \nof  the  Jupiter  IPP  would  have  to  be  extended  to  avoid  serious  load  shedding.  Once  the \ntransmission  line  becomes  operational  in  2007,  sales  growth  would  be  constrained  to  the \nnumber of new connections that could be made each year. EDC will experience sustained net \nlosses through 2008, but it would only miss its revenue requirements in 2006 (by 1%), and debt-\nservice coverage would still be within covenanted levels.   \n \n16. \nThe costs of both EDC\u2019s own generation and of its power purchases vary with changes \nin the fuel price. If the fuel price is $30/barrel instead of $25 over the forecast period, EDC will \nnot meet its revenue requirements in 2004 and 2005 (shortfalls of 2% and 1%, respectively), but \nwould  still  meet  the  minimum  debt-service  coverage  ratio.  If  EAC  permits  a  fuel  pass-through \nmechanism in the tariff-setting guidelines, this would mitigate the risks of fuel price shocks. \n \n17. \nIf  the  construction  of  the  line  is  delayed  by  1  year,  EDC  would  still  meet  its  financial \ncovenants,  but  sales  growth  would  be  constrained  in  FY  2007.  Even  to  achieve  10%  sales \ngrowth, EDC would need to run all its diesel- and heavy fuel oil-fired generating plants to meet \nthe shortfall.  \n18. \nThe projections assume that the action plan in relation to the collection of Government \naccounts  receivable  is  fully  implemented  in  2003.  However,  if  Government  and  municipal \naccounts receivable accumulate again to the equivalent of 5 months of average sales, EDC will \nstill meet its revenue-based covenants despite shortfalls in net operating cash from FY 2004 to \nFY 2009. This would precipitate increases in payables to IPPs and fuel suppliers and a vicious \ncycle of arrears. \n \n19. \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n\nfinancial  management  practices \n\nA  risk  assessment  of  EDC\u2019s \n\nis  attached  as \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTableA4.4 Summary of Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge Consolidated Financial Statements and Projections, 2000\u20132013 \n \n\n \n3\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n31\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \nTable A5.1: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\nInfrastructure \n220 kV Transmission Line \nTakeo Substation \nWest Phnom Penh Substation \nNational Control Center \nSpares and Equipment \nHigh-Voltage Line O&M (12 months) \nReinforcement of 115 kV system  \nModifications to GS1, GS2, and GS3 \n \n\nItem \n Base Costs \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.

financial  analysis  of  both  project  components\u2014the  transmission  line  and  the  bulk \n1. \nsupply  distribution\u2014has  been  carried  out.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  has \nbeen  estimated  for  both  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC)  and  a  private  rural  electric  enterprise \n(REE) because of the mix of investment required in the distribution component. Based on this \nanalysis, both the transmission component and the distribution component are financially viable. \n \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nB. \n \nTwo different WACCs have been calculated: one for EDC and one for an REE. The cost \n2. \nof debt is assumed to be the same for all three cofinanciers (the Asian Development Bank, the \nNordic Development Fund, and the World Bank), as the same re-lending terms from the Ministry \nof Economy and Finance to EDC will be applied. While the nominal re-lending rate is 4.2%, the \ntax-adjusted cost is 3.8% (the corporate tax rate is 9%). \n \n3. \nIn terms of estimating the cost of equity, the lack of functioning debt and equity markets \nin  Cambodia  hampers  the  ability  to  derive  the  true  cost  of  equity.  The  lack  of  a  Government \nbond  rate  means  that  the  risk  free  rate  has  been  benchmarked  from  rates  in  Thailand,  where \nthe  yield  on  10-year  bonds  is  currently  around  3.5%.  Given  the  less  developed  nature  of \nCambodia\u2019s economic and financial infrastructure, adopting an increment on the risk free rate in \nThailand  to  reflect  this  country  risk  is  appropriate.  Using  reference  rates  from  neighboring \ncountries, a country risk premium of 6.8% has been calculated, which results in a risk free rate \nof  10.3%.  A  market  risk  premium  of  11%  has  been  calculated  to  reflect  the  additional  market, \ntax,  and  country  risk  of  Cambodia  above  a  market  risk  premium  reference  rate.  Therefore  the \nnominal  cost  of  equity  for  Cambodia  is  approximately  21.3%.  Adjusting  for  local  inflation,  the \nreal cost of equity is 14.4%. \n \n4. \nThrough  the  Government,  EDC  has  access  to  the  low-cost  multilateral  debt  and  the \nability to maintain a higher leverage for its projects (80% levered). Therefore the WACC for EDC \ncan be calculated as shown in Table A8.1. \n \n\nTable A8.1:  Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n\nSource of Funds \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan  \n\nWorld Bank Loan \n\nNordic Development Fund Loan \n \nGovernment Counterpart Funds \n\nMinimum \nRate Test \n(%) \n\nComposite \nCapital Cost \n(%) \n\nFinancing \n($ million) \n\nWeighting \n(%) \n\n44.3 \n\n16.0 \n\n11.0 \n\n23.7 \n\n46.6 \n\n16.8 \n\n11.6 \n\n25.0 \n\nReal \nCost \n(%) \n\n3.8 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.5% \n\n3.5% \n\n3.5% \n\n1.9 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.4 \n\n3.0 \n\n14.4 \n\n          \u2013\u2013 \n\n      Total  \n\u2013\u2013 = not available.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n5. \nLocal private sector operators in rural areas, such as REEs, have no direct access to the \nconcessional  lending.

Leverage  of  50% \nhas  been  assumed.  Limited  credit  is  available  from  a  handful  of  commercial  banks,  but  at  a \nmuch  higher  cost  (a  real  rate  of  approximately  11.6%).  The  WACC  for  REEs  can  be \napproximated as shown in Table A8.2. \n \n\nTable A8.2: Weighted Average Cost of Funds for Rural Electricity Enterprises \n \nReal Cost \n(%) \n11.6 \n14.4 \n\nComposite Capital Cost \n(%) \n5.8 \n7.2 \n13.0 \n\nItem \nDebt  \nEquity \n     Weighted Average \nSource: Asian Development Bank data. \n\nWeighting \n(%) \n50.0 \n50.0 \n \n\n \n\nDemand Forecasts and Sales Revenues for Phnom Penh \n\n \n6. \nThe distribution component of the Project must incorporate the costs of capital. EDC is \ninvesting in 22 kilovolt (kV) feeders from the high-voltage substations in West Phnom Penh and \nTakeo to the 22 kV bulk supply transformers. From that point, the REEs are assumed to invest \nin the low-voltage distribution lines, purchase electricity from the 22 kV network, and distribute \nthe  electricity  to  consumers.  For  the  distribution  component  the  calculations  have  assumed  a \n50/50 split in investment costs, and hence, the resulting cost of capital is the average of 6% for \nEDC and 13% for the REEs, i.e. 9.5%. \n \nC. \n \nA model was developed to forecast the trend in electricity consumption for five sectors of \n7. \nthe Cambodian economy between 2003 and 2019.  Analysis  of  the  forecasts  revealed  that \ndemand would exceed generating capacity (specifically, peak supply) until the transmission line \nwas constructed. Supply currently consists of the 52-megawatt (MW) capacity of EDC\u2019s diesel \nor  heavy-fuel  reciprocating  engines  and  57  MW  of  contracted  independent  power  producer \ncapacity in Phnom Penh. When a new 30 MW independent power producer is commissioned in \n2005, EDC will reduce the use of its own generation plant except for meeting peak demand. In \naddition,    the  implied  growth  in  demand  will  likely  strain  EDC\u2019s  ability  to  connect sufficient \ncustomers to achieve the modeled increase in demand. Consequently, the load forecasts were \nrevised downward to accord with expected generation in 2004\u20132007 and to better reflect EDC\u2019s \nresource constraints. This suggests that Cambodia will have some unmet electricity demand by \nthe time the transmission line is commissioned. Thus the strong forecast growth in demand on \nthe line implied by the forecasts is reasonable, given that the unmet demand is quite significant. \n \nD. \n \nA  financial  analysis  of  the  transmission  component  was  undertaken  by  valuing  the \n8. \nenergy supplied by the transmission line at the prevailing average tariff of KR589 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) in Phnom Penh. In line with the assumptions in EDC\u2019s financial model, the average \nreal  tariff  was  assumed  to  remain  constant  throughout  the  forecast  period  while  incorporating \nchanges in the composition of total demand served. The cost of meeting this demand was taken \nto be (i) the capital cost of the transmission line, including physical contingencies and taxes and \nduties,  but  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction  (approximately  $75 \nmillion);  (ii)  the  quantity  of  energy  imported  from  Viet  Nam,  valued  at  the  average purchase \nprice  of  $0.07/kWh,  including  import  duties  and  value-added  tax  (VAT);  (iii)  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the transmission line, valued at 2% of the capital cost of the transmission \nline;  (iv)  the  O&M  distribution  cost  of  $0.005/kWh;  and  (v)  the  return  on  and  of  distribution \n\nTransmission Component \n\n \n\n\f \n\n36\n\nAppendix 8 \n\ncapital,  estimated  at  $0.017/kWh.  An  estimated  2%  in  transmission  losses  and  13.5%  in \ndistribution  losses  were  subtracted  from  the  amount  of  energy  imported  to  determine  net \nrevenues from energy sales. All project benefits and costs were discounted at a rate of 6%, the \ncalculated WACC for EDC. \n \n9. \nAfter accounting for the full costs of meeting the additional demand via the transmission \nline,  the  Project  generates  a  significant  net  return,  suggesting  that  it  is  viable  from  a  financial \nperspective  (Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  more  details).  The  net  present  value  of  the \nProject is estimated to be about KR2,506 billion, which is equivalent to a financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) of approximately 35.3%. \n \n10. \nThe  financial  results  for  the  transmission  component  have  been  tested  for  the  key \nvariables for the project. The analysis of the impact of risks faced by the Project indicates that \neven if extreme events occur, such as stagnant growth for five years or a construction delay of \nfour years, the Project remains financially viable by a comfortable margin. A significant increase \nin the cost of imported energy from Viet Nam would also not undermine the Project\u2019s viability.  \nTable A8.3 presents the sensitivity results. \n \n\nTableA8.3: Sensitivity Results on Transmission Component \n \n\nVariable \nBase Case \n\nAssumption \n \n\nDemand  Growth \n\nNo growth in demand for 5 years \n\nConstruction Delays \n\nIndustrial Consumers \n\nTransmission Line \n\nConstruction Costs \n\nImports from the transmission line do \nnot begin until 2011 \nGrowth in demand is only 50%  \nof the rate predicted \n15% increase in capital costs \n\nImport Price from Viet Nam \n\nIncreased by 15% in 2012 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n\nFinancial Internal  \nRate of Return \n(%) \n35.3 \n\n30.7 \n\n24.3 \n\n31.0 \n\n32.5% \n\n33.5 \n\nfor \n\nDistribution Component  \n\nA  bulk  supply  distribution  system  was  considered \n\nE. \n \nthree  alternative  areas  \n11. \ni.e. 1 kilometer, 2 kilometer and 5 kilometer wide areas on both sides of the transmission line. \nThe 1 kilometer wide zone was shown to the economically most beneficial. A financial analysis \nof  was  undertaken  of  a  bulk  supply  arrangement  financed  under  the  loan  coupled  with  private \nsector  reticulation.  Demand  was  estimated  for  consumers  located  within  1  kilometer  on  both \nsides of the transmission line. Poor households were calculated to consume approximately 90 \nkWh per year and nonpoor households about 330 kWh per year. The benefits from this network \nwere  estimated  by  valuing  the  energy  demand  supplied  through  the  distribution  line  at  the \nestimated  cost  to  supply.  This  cost  consisted  of  two  components:  EDC\u2019s  estimated  cost  of \nsupplying bulk energy to a private service provider and the REE\u2019s estim ated cost of reticulating \nelectricity. Based on discussions with the regulator in Cambodia, the tariff was derived so as to \nincorporate (i) a bulk energy supply cost for electricity supplied at 22 kV by EDC; (ii) a return on \nEDC\u2019s investment in the distribution line up to the transformer; (iii) the recovery of O&M costs on \nthe distribution line set at 2% of the line cost; (iv) a return on the REE\u2019s investment in the low-\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n37\n\nvoltage component; and (v) the recovery of the REE\u2019s O&M costs on the line, estimated at 2% \nof the construction costs. \n \n12. \nThe bulk energy supply cost was calculated to include both EDC\u2019s supply of energy from \nthe  imports  from  Viet  Nam  and  diesel-fired  generation  in  Phnom  Penh.  A  unit  border  cost  of \nenergy imported from Viet Nam of $0.06/kWh was assumed. EDC\u2019s generation was estimated \nto  average  $0.11/kWh  based  on  the  operation  of  existing  units  and  of  supply  by  independent \npower producers. The calculations assumed that VAT and import duties are charged on these \ninputs. The supply price also includes a return on EDC\u2019s investment in the transmission line and \ncovers  the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  transmission  line,  estimated  at  2%  of  the \ncapital cost of the transmission line. \n \nIn calculating the cost of capital items involved in the supply of energy, the return of and \n13. \non, capital was calculated using an annuity approach. The annuity was calculated such that the \ndiscounted  present  value  of  the  annuity  over  the  life  of  the  asset  equals  the  cost  of  the \ninvestment. These annuities were calculated using a weighted average cost of capital of 6% for \nEDC and 13% for the REE. O&M costs on the distribution network were set at 2% of the capital \ncost of the distribution line. Losses of 8.5% were assumed.  \n \n14. \nThe  cost  of  meeting  the  demand  on  the  distribution  line  was  taken  to  be  (i)  the  capital \ncost  of  $5.1  million  for  construction  of  the  distribution  line  to  the  low-voltage  level;  (ii)  the \nquantity  of  energy  imported  from  Viet  Nam,  valued  at  the  average  bulk  supply  price  of \napproximately  $.084/kWh;  (iii)  the  O&M  on  the  distribution  network,  valued  at  $0.055/kWh;  \n(iv) the line loss of 2% of energy dispatched from Viet Nam for use in the respective zones; and \n(v) the connection cost, valued at $7.50 per connected customer. Energy imports include 10% \nVAT and 7% import duties, and an average level of taxes and duties of 15% was assumed to \napply to the construction cost of the distribution line. \n \nAll  project  benefits  and  costs  were  discounted  at  a  rate  equivalent  to  the  composite \n15. \nWACC for EDC and an REE. The analysis was run from 2006, when the distribution lines are \nassumed  to  be  constructed,  until  2035,  when  the  lines  are  assumed  to  be  at  the  end  of  their \neconomic lives. The analysis indicates that the distribution of electricity is marginally viable, with \nthe distribution of electricity estimated to achieve an FIRR of 12.6% (above a composite WACC \nof  9.5%).  Select  sensitivity  cases  were  modeled  on  the  financial  returns  of  the  distribution \ncomponent. Any overruns in capital costs in the low-voltage systems would result in adjustment \nto  the  consumer  tariffs,  therefore  those  risks  would  be  mitigated  once  construction  had  been \ncompleted. However, a sensitivity case was run in which connections to the system were half of \nthose  expected  (which  could  be  due  to  such  barriers  as  connection  costs  or  high  tariffs).  This \nwould  result  in  an  FIRR  that  would  make  the  project  unviable.  As ian  Development  Bank \nassistance with consumer services and REE support should help mitigate these risks. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n38\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nAn  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  two  components  of  the  Project  within \n1. \nCambodia plus the connecting transmission line in Viet Nam to allow a distributional analysis of \nnet benefits between the two countries. The analysis for Cambodia is based on the assumption \nthat the next lowest-cost alternative would meet the demand that would otherwise be met by the \ntransmission  line.  The  bulk  supply  distribution  component  that  will  electrify  communities  along \nthe  transmission  line  route  in  Cambodia  was  analyzed  as  an  incremental  component  to  the \ntransmission line. Four alternatives for supply were analyzed to ensure that electricity demand \nin  rural  areas  would  be  met  by  a  least-cost  alternative.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) for the least-cost option was calculated on the basis that demand would not be met by \nan alternative source of supply (i.e., the without project case). \n \nB. \n \n\nTransmission Line \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n1. \n \n2. \nA  model  was  developed  to  forecast  electricity  demand  for  five  sectors  in  Phnom  Penh \nbetween  2004  and  March  2038.  These  sectors  include  residential,  Government,  industrial, \nhotels and commercial entities, and other. The demands for each sector were forecast based on \nhistorical  monthly  data  on  consumption  for  Phnom  Penh.  Demands  were  hypothesized  to  be \ninfluenced by the real price of electricity and by population and economic growth. The growth in \ndemand from the commercial and hotel sector and the industrial sector was also assumed to be \ninfluenced  by  growth  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  the  world\u2019s  seven  leading \neconomies (the Group of Seven). The data, specification of the model, and tests are described \nin Supplementary Appendixes H and I.  \n \n3. \nThe  results  suggest  that  the  main  drivers  of  electricity  demand  are  population  and \ndomestic  economic  growth.  Global  economic  growth,  as  measured  by  growth  in  the  Group  of \nSeven  countries,  is  found  to  be  the  main  driver  for  growth  in  consumption  in  the  hotel  and \ncommercial  sectors.  The  price  elasticities  have  the  expected  signs  and  were  found  to  be \ngenerally low or not statistically significant. The consumer category most sensitive to price was \nindustry. \n \nThe  estimated  coefficients  from  the  regression  model  were  used  to  forecast  demand. \n4. \nThe  demand  forecasts  suggest  a  significant  growth  in  demand  of  between  10.%  and12.5% \nduring  the  first  5  years  of  the  Project.  In  the  longer  run,  growth  in  demand  will  slow  down  to \nabout  5%.  The  increase  in  demand  in  the  first  years  of  the  Project  is  due  to  a  significant \nincrease in the  number  of  large-scale  consumers.  This  will  result  in  a  change  in  the  sectoral \ncomposition of demand. The share of demand from the hotel and commercial and the industrial \nsectors is expected to grow from 30% of total demand in 2004 to about 50% in 2017.  \n \nThe forecast revealed that demand would exceed generating capacity in the time before \n5. \nthe transmission line is constructed. Consequently, demand forecasts were revised downward \nfor  2004\u20132007  to  better  reflect  EDC\u2019s  ability  to  connect  new  consumers.  This  suggests  that \nPhnom Penh will have unmet electricity demand by the time the transmission line is operational. \nBy this time,  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  connect  new  consumers. \nThe  analysis  shows  that  the  capacity  of  the  transmission  would  be  fully  utilized  by  2017, \nalthough the system would require new peaking capacity in 2014. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n39\n\n2. \n\nLeast-Cost Alternatives \n\n6. \nA  least-cost  alternative  was  developed  to  meet  the  demand  that  would  otherwise  be \nsupplied  through  the  transmission  line.  The  feasible  least-cost  alternative  is  a  conventional \nheavy fuel oil engine plant followed by single-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbines fueled by \nheavy fuel oil. These were phased in such a way that they would meet the growing demand that \nwould otherwise be met by supply from the transmission line. Thus in the following analysis, the \nwithout  project  scenario  is  assumed  to  be  the  next  lowest-cost alternative to the transmission \nline. \n \n7. \nThe  long-run  marginal  costs  for  the  least-cost  alternative  and  for  the  transmission  line \nwere  calculated  for  each  consumer  category.  The  results  suggest  that  the  long-run marginal \ncost for the transmission line would result in a lower cost of supply for all consumer categories, \nranging  from  4.9%  lower  costs  for  the  Government  sector  to  3.3%  for  residential  consumers, \ncompared with the alternative.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n8. \nThe  benefits  taken  into  account  for  assessing  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project \nincluded (i) the additional demand created through lower tariffs than would be the case without \nthe transmission line, (ii) the lower cost of production associated with nonincremental demands, \nand (iii) the value of increased reliability and quality of supply associated with the transmission \nline.  \n \nIncremental  demands  were  evaluated  by  comparing  demand  with  the  transmission  line \n9. \nand with the next lowest-cost alternative. The incremental benefits were valued at the average \ndemand  price  with  and  without  the  Project  for  each  consumer  category.  If  the  higher  cost  of \nsupply  associated  with  the  least-cost  alternative  to  the  transmission  line  was  passed  on  to \nconsumers, tariffs would need to rise by 9% for poor residential consumers and about 5% to 6% \nfor  other  consumer  categories.  However,  the  low  price  elasticities  combined  with  rather  small \ntariff changes result in extremely small incremental benefits. \n  \nNonincremental demands arising from the lower cost of production with the transmission \n10. \nline  were  calculated  by  deducting  the  incremental  demand  from  the  total  demand  supplied  by \nthe  transmission  line.  Benefits  associated  with  nonincremental  demand  were  evaluated  at  the \nlong-run  marginal  cost  with  and  without  the  Project.  These  benefits  account  for  92%  of  total \ngross benefits from the Project. \n \n11. \nThe reduction in lost load was estimated by comparing the reliability of the transmission \nline with the expected reliability of the least-cost alternative. The forced outage rate for the least-\ncost alternative was assessed to be about 3.7% of expected demand in 2007 and assumed to \nremain  at  this  rate  throughout  the  study  period.  In  contrast,  the  forced  outage  rate  of  the \ntransmission line was assessed to be 0.04%.  \n \nAn  unexpected  interruption  to  supply  can  impose  large  costs  on  consumers  and  on \n12. \nsociety  at  large.  The  value  of  the  lost  load  is  also likely to vary across consumer categories. \nLost load for residential and Government consumers was evaluated at the average tariff, while \nthe value of the lost load to commercial and industrial customers was evaluated at the cost of \nself-generation. Benefits associated with lost load account for 7% of total gross benefits.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n40\n\nAppendix 9 \n\n4. \n\nProject Costs \n\n13. \nProject costs were converted to economic prices by removing taxes on imported energy \nand value-added tax and duties on imported capital equipment. Traded goods were brought to \ndomestic  prices  using  the  calculated  shadow  exchange  rate  factor.  The  costs  of  the  Project \ninclude (i) the capital cost of the transmission line, including costs for resettlement; (ii) the cost \nof energy imported from Viet Nam; (iii) the transmission line loss of 2%; and (iv) operation and \nmaintenance of $0.0014 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), including labor costs, on the transmission line. \nIn addition, distribution losses of 13.5% and operation and maintenance costs of $0.0038/kWh \non the distribution network were accounted for. \n \n\n5. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n14. \nTaking  into  account  the  economic  costs  and  benefits,  the  Project  yields  a  net  present \nvalue (NPV) of $201.26 million to the Cambodian economy and an EIRR of 32%. All net benefits \nare  discounted  by  the  12%  economic  discount  rate.  The  NPV  reflects  the  difference  in  net \nbenefits between the transmission line and the next lowest-cost alternative.  \n \n\n6. \n\nViet Nam \n\nFor the works in Cambodia to bring benefits to Cambodia, the Project also needs to be \n15. \nlinked  to  the  transmission  line  in  Viet  Nam.  The  economic  analysis  conducted  for  the \nVietnamese  part  gives  an  NPV  of  $17.85  million  and  an  EIRR  of  20%.  This  analysis  is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n\n7. \n\nBulk Supply Distribution Component \n\n16. \nThe  bulk  supply  distribution  component  was  identified  to  provide  benefits  to  rural \ncommunities  in  Takeo  Province  that  could  be  adversely  affected by the transmission line and \nwould otherwise not benefit from it. The incidence of poverty in these communities ranges from \n25%  to  75%,  and  the  population  density  in  the  area  is  low.  Households  currently  face  high \nenergy costs for a poor quality of supply from batteries and kerosene.  \n \n17. \nAn analysis of four different supply options suggested that the conventional single\u2013wire, \nearth-return  line  would  be  the  least-cost option.  Three  areas  adjacent  to  the  transmission  line \nwere  assessed  for  electrification.  The  most  economically  viable  option  gave  an  NPV  of  $5.33 \nmillion and an EIRR of 25%. This would include electrifying an estimated 14,200 households, of \nwhich 5,700 would be poor, over the lifetime of the Project. The detailed economic analysis of \nthe bulk supply distribution component is provided in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n8. \n\nRisk and Sensitivity Analyses \n\na. \n\nTransmission Line Risks \n\nA sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine how sensitive the economic viability \n18. \nof  the  transmission  line  is  with  respect  to  key  parameters  used  in  the  economic  analysis.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  conclusion  of  economic  viability  is  robust  with  respect  to \nsignificant changes in all tested  parameters. The results of the sensitivity analysis are given in \nTable A9.1. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n41\n\n \n\nVariable \n\nImport Price  \n\nTable A9.1: Sensitivity Results \n \n\nPopulation, Real GDP, GDP in the Group of Seven \n\nConstruction Cost \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\nSwitching Value  \n\nChange (%) \n\n0.393 \n\n1.665 \n\n4.860 \n\n(60.7) \n\n66.5 \n\n386.0 \n\n \n19. \nSensitivity analysis was also undertaken with respect to key project risks to examine the \nprobability of the Project becoming economically unviable (Table A9.2).

The results indicate that utilization would need to fall to 135 \ngigawatt-hours  per  year  to  reach  the  EIRR  threshold  of  12%.  While  this  level  is  well  below \nCambodia\u2019s  import  needs,  the  power  purchase  agreement  between  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam \nwill include a minimum load requirement of 300 gigawatt-hours per year. This level of utilization \nwill ensure a comfortable margin in maintaining the economic viability of the transmission line.  \n \nA  risk  analysis  was  undertaken  with  respect  to  the  risk  factors  used  in  the  sensitivity \n21. \nanalysis. \nin  Supplementary  \nAppendix H. The results of the risk analysis show that the expected EIRR would fall from 32% to \nabout 27%. The probability of the EIRR falling below the discount rate of 12% is less than 5%.  \n \n\nImposed  distributions  on  selected  variables  are  reported \n\nb. \n\nBulk Supply Distribution Component Risks \n\n22. \nThe sensitivity analysis undertaken for the bulk supply distribution component revealed \nthat  the  number  of  connections  would  be  the  key  project  risk.  This  finding  and  the \nsocioeconomic conditions in the project area suggest that the affordability of  connection costs \nmay  need  to  be  addressed  through  payment  in  installments.  The  results  of  the  risk  analysis \nshow that the expected EIRR falls to 14% as a result of imposing distributions on the key risk \nvariables. The probability that the EIRR will fall below the 12% discount rate is 8.4%. Thus this \n\n \n\n\f \n\n42\n\nAppendix 9 \n\ncomponent  is  more  sensitive  to  risks  than  the  transmission  line.  Further  details  of  risk  and \nsensitivity analysis are given in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n\nc. \n\nDistributional Analysis \n\n23. \nA distributional analysis was carried out for the transmission line and for the bulk supply \ndistribution component. Reduction in lost load was identified as the key benefit for consumers in \nPhnom  Penh.  As  a  consequence  of  assuming  no  change  in  the  existing  tariff  structure,  \nnonincremental benefits, which account for the majority of total benefits, accrue to  Electricit\u00e9 du \nCambodge.  While  the  poor  will  experience  direct  benefits  from  improved  reliability,  most \nbenefits to the poor are indirect. These benefits are likely to be realized through the employment \nopportunities  resulting  from  the  expansion  of  the  industrial  sector  and  through  other  economic \ngrowth effects.  \n \n24. \nThe  majority  of  benefits  to  the  poor  from  the  bulk  supply  distribution  component  are \ndirect.  Nonincremental  benefits  of  the  bulk  supply  distribution  component  will  accrue  to  end-\nconsumers. End-consumers will also experience a significant reduction in the price they pay for \nelectricity and in the time associated with traveling to recharge batteries.  \n  \n25. \nOverall,  the  Project  will  yield  an  NPV  of  net  benefits  of  $224.44  million.  Cambodia  will \nreceive  92%  of  these  benefits.  The  poor  in  Cambodia  will  receive  15.1%  of  these  benefits, \namounting to $31.2 million. This share is in excess of the poor\u2019s share of GDP in Phnom Penh, \nbut less than the poor\u2019s share of GDP for the country as a whole. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n43\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? Yes \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis? Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \n1.  The poor in Cambodia are heavily  burdened  by  their  lack  of  access  to  modern  energy  sources.  Living  in  fuel \npoverty means that households spend a large proportion of their scarce cash income on alternative sources of \nenergy, with lower efficiency are exposed to inadequate and smoky lighting, have less access to information, are \nconstrained in terms of village social activity, and spend long hours producing manual energy. It also means that \nvaccines, medications, and animal vaccines cannot be stored nearby; that children have less time for studying; \nand that people feel unsafe at night. Fuel poverty particularly affects the poor, because their cash incomes are \nscarce, their workloads are heavy, and their opportunity cost of time is high. Inadequate and expensive sources \nof  energy  affect  the  economic  viability  of  activities  pursued  by  the  poor.  It  reduces  their  ability  to  diversify \nlivelihoods  and  income  activities.  Access  to  modern  energy  will  significantly  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  poor \nhouseholds,  reduce  their  expenditure  on  energy,  increase  their  quality  of  life,  provide  increased  access  to \ninformation, and help reduce their workloads.  \n\n \n2.  Electricity  is  a  key  input  into  food  processing,  small-scale  enterprises.  and  other  industrial  and  commercial \nactivities important for economic growth and employment. A reliable electricity supply will reduce the barriers to \nexpansion  and  will  lead  to  productivity  enhancements.  Increased  commercial  activity  in  rural  areas  is  key  to \nreducing  poverty.  An  improved  electricity  supply  will  remove  a  significant constraint to economic growth in the \ntarget provinces. This will better enable the poor to capture the benefits of economic growth.  \n\n \n3.  Access to a reliable source of electricity supply is scarce among both the urban and rural poor in Cambodia. \nExisting data suggest that only 15% of the population has access to a reliable source of electricity. To support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty the electricity demand of the poor must be addressed as an integral \npart  of  the  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Vice  versa,  any  strategy  for  power  development  must  address  how  to \nprovide electricity services to the rural and urban poor.    \n\nPoverty Analysis         \n\nPoverty Classification:  \u201cOther\u201d \nThematic Classification: Economic Growth/Regional Cooperation \n\nData and Information Sources: \n \n4.  The  poverty  assessment  and  socioeconomic  profile  are  based  on  a  rural  electrification  survey  in  the  targeted \nproject area for the bulk supply distribution component. This was complemented by data from a nationwide rural \nelectrification survey, by statistics derived for Phnom Penh from the Cambodian socioeconomic survey in 1999, \nand by secondary data sources and studies of urban poverty in Phnom Penh. In addition, visits were conducted \nto consult with the urban and rural poor.  \n\n \nPoverty Profile and Issues:  \nPhnom Penh \n \n5.  The  Cambodian  socioeconomic  survey  indicates  that  about  15%  of  the  population  in  Phnom  Penh  lives  below \nthe  poverty  of  line  of  $0.63/capita/day.  However,  many  low-income  residents  are  not  registered  with  local \nauthorities, and as such are not part of the official statistics. As a consequence, the poverty incidence in Phnom \nPenh is likely to be higher. The poor often reside in squatter areas with insecure land tenure, and therefore may \nface a higher cost of and/or more difficulties in accessing services, including electricity, garbage collection, and \nwater.  Some  poor  are  unable  to  meet  up-front  charges  to  access  electricity  services  in  one  installment.  These \ncosts include connection fees, consumption deposits, and costs associated with wiring, Findings from field visits \nto poor areas in Phnom Penh indicate that the poor living in squatter areas both in the central districts and in the \noutskirts of Phnom Penh access services through a wholesaler at far higher costs than with a direct Electricit\u00e9 du \nCambodge (EDC) connection. The tariff for electricity supplied by a wholesaler ranges from $0.30/kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)  to  $0.45,kWh,  compared  with  a  lifeline  tariff  of  $0.09/kWh  offered  by  EDC.  This  means  a  monthly \nexpenditure of $7.5 to $13.5 for 30 kWh rather than the $2.6 that they would have paid with direct EDC access. \nThe  figure  of  30  kWh  is  an  approximate  upper  estimate  of  a  poor\u2019s  household  consumption  based  on  the \naffordability of appliances. \n\nIn  other  cases,  the  poor  who  cannot  overcome  barriers  to  connect  will  access  electricity  services  by  sharing \n\n \n \nB. \n\n   \n6. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n44\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nconnections. This also depletes the ability of lifeline tariffs to target the poor, because their consumption would \nbe measured by one meter shared by at least one other household. With a single meter, a household consuming \n50  kWh/month  would  have  an  electricity  bill  of  $4.4;  however,  if  the  household  shares  this  connection  with \nanother household, the monthly bill for the 50 kWh consumed by each household would increase to $5.6, 27% \nhigher than with a single connection.  \n\n \n7.  Thus institutional constraints and up-front costs may lead to Inefficient targeting of subsidies. Existing evidence \nsuggest that this may be the case for the electricity sector in Cambodia, which means that the nonpoor may be \nbenefiting  more  from  the  subsidies  than  the  poor.  The  economic  cost  of  the  subsidies  in  terms  of  distortions \nand/or forgone expenditure alternatives more effective in reaching the poor is costly and is borne by both poor \nand nonpoor.    \n\n \nBulk Supply Distribution Project Area  \n \n8.  Communities along the transmission line route are vulnerable to such external shocks as flooding and drought. \nPoverty  levels  are  consequently  high.  The  district-level  incidence  of  poverty  ranges  from  27.6%  to  44.3%. The \nincidence  of  poverty  in  the  project  targeted  communities  along  the  transmission  line  ranges  from  25%  to  75%. \nThe average incidence is about 40%.  \n\n \n9.  Table  A10.1  shows  the  socioeconomic  profile  by  poverty  classification  of  a  random  sample  of  the  expected \nproject beneficiaries.  Poor  households  are  more  likely  to  be  headed  by  a  woman  or  a  member  of  an  ethnic \nminority, to be dependent on growing rice as a source of income, and to have lost more work days to illness than \nthe nonpoor. Education levels for both poor and nonpoor are low as reflected in the average years of schooling.  \n\nTable A10.1: Household Profiles \n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTotal \n\nFemale Household Head \n\nNon-Khmer (ethnic minority) \n\nAverage Number of Years Schooling of \n\nHousehold Adult Members  \n\nAverage no. of days lost to illness in the last \n\n3 months  \n\nPoor Households \n\nNonpoor Households \n\nNumber \n\nShare (%) \n\nNumber \n\nShare (%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n192 \n\n34 \n\n3 \n\n133 \n\n3.76 \n\n0.75 \n\n17.7  \n\n1.6  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n319 \n\n44 \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  3.64 \n\n  0.66 \n\n13.8 \n\n0.3  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMain Occupation Is Growing Rice \n\n69.3  \n\n214 \n\n67.1  \n\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance field survey along the transmission line route. \n\n \nConnecting the Poor:  \n \n10.  To  ensure  that  the  poor  can  fully  benefit  from  investments  in  the  electricity  sector  they  need  to  have  direct \naccess  to  electricity  services.  Institutional  issues  such  as  land  tenure  tend  not  to  be  a  barrier  to  accessing \nelectricity  services  in  rural  Cambodia;  however,  the  up-front  costs  associated  with  connection,  including \nconnection  charges,  consumption  deposits,  and  wiring  may  add  up  to  an  unaffordable  amount.  The  survey \nincluded an assessment of possible barriers to connection, including the affordability of up-front charges. Of the \nhouseholds  along  the  transmission  route,  12.5%  indicated  that  they  would  not  be  able  to  afford  up-front \nconnection costs. Most households would be able to use their own savings to connect, while others would need \nto  borrow  money  or  sell  livestock  (Table  A10.2).  Rural  electricity  Entrepreneurs  (REEs)  will  be  responsible  for \nsupplying to end-consumers. Allowing consumers to pay the connection fee in installments could be an important \nmeasure to increase connections. In rural Cambodia, this business practice is often implemented to increase the \nnumber of consumers. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n45\n\nTable A10.2: Means to Pay for Up-Front Charges \n \n\nPrimary \nSources \n\n361 \n\nSecondary \nSource \n\nPayment Mode \n\nUse of own savings  \n\nBorrow from friends and relatives \n\nBorrow from moneylender or others  \n\nSell livestock \n\nSell other assets \n\nPay after good crop \n\nOther \n\n19 \n\n2 \n\n45 \n\n12 \n\n2 \n\n9 \n\n141 \n\n30 \n\n41 \n\n6 \n\n30 \n\n50 \n\n25 \n\nSimply cannot afford KR140,000  \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance field survey along the transmission line route. \n \n\n27 \n\n67 \n\n11.  To promote connections for the poor in Phnom Penh, EDC has agreed to offer a 5-ampere capacity connection \nrather  than  a  10-ampere  connection  to  better  accommodate  the  low  consumption  levels  by  the  poor.  This  will \nreduce the connection fee from $15.5 to $7.8 and reduce the consumption deposit from $13 to $6.5. Overall, this \nwill reduce the up-front outlay by more than $14. This is a significant reduction for a poor household. Under the \nloan, EDC will assess whether installment payments will still need to be introduced to connect the poor in Phnom \nPenh.  EDC  has,  in  principle,  approved  installment  payment  of  connection  fees,  but  implementation  will take \nplace in accordance with the findings of a more in-depth analysis of the affordability of up-front costs.  \n\n \nImpacts in Rural Areas: \n\n \n12.  The  most  immediate  and  direct  impact  of  providing  reliable  electricity  services  to  the  poor  is  the  effect  on \nexpenditure savings in relation to energy (Table A10.3).  In general, the poor\u2019s consumption is determined by the \naffordability  of  appliances.  However,  the  improved  reliability  and  cash  savings  will  induce  households  to \nconsume  more  electricity.  Most  households,  including  the  poor,  indicated  that  they  would  purchase  a  color \ntelevision  if  they  had  access  to  reliable  electricity.  Even  with  the  expected  increase  in  consumption  levels \nresulting from providing poor households with access to grid electricity, cash savings will be significant. Monthly \nelectricity expenditure is expected to drop by more than 25% and income shares spent on electricity will fall from \naround 30% to less than 20%.  \n\n \nTable A10.3: Immediate Impact on Poor Rural Households - Cash Savings (Average $/month) \nShare of HH cash \nElectricity \nincome  \nexpenditure \n(%) \n($) \n\nElectricity \nconsumption \n\n \n\nShare of \ntotal HH \nexpenditure \n(%) \n6 \n1\u20132 \n\n30 \n19 \n\nWithout Project \nWith Project \n\n4 kWh \n7.2\u201313.2 kWh \n\n4.44 \n2.06\u20133.78 \n\nKWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: PPTA field survey along the transmission line route \n\n \n13.  Other  impacts  of  electrification  on  the  poor  in  Cambodia  include  benefits  of  increased  social  activity  in  the \nvillages, increased access to information and the enjoyment that television brings, ability for children to study at \nnight  and  the  ability  to  better  store  vaccines  and  other  medications.  While  many  of  these  social  benefits  are \ndifficult  to  quantify  and  are  perceived  welfare  impacts  stated  by  the  poor  themselves,  they  do  reflect \nimprovements in the quality of life and are equally important to expenditure savings. Given the history of violence \nin Cambodia, proper lighting in the evening also gives a sense of safety. Many of the social benefits occur at the \ncommunity level and have \u201cpublic good\u201d characteristics and as such they do not exclude households in electrified \nvillages that are not connected.   \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n46\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nParticipation Process \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \n\n \nParticipation strategy  \n\nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  undertaken  during  the  social  assessment  and  has \ncontributed to the resettlement planning process. \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  includes  a  detailed  public  participation  and  consultation \nstrategy  for  further  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks  \n\n \n \nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \n\nSignificant, \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \n\nSignificant \n\n \n \nPlan  Prepared \n\nResettlement plan. \n\nGender \n\nNot significant \n\nProvision is made in the \nresettlement plan. \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nThe Project will significantly affect more than \n200 people through relocation and loss of \nproductive income.

An income restoration \nprogram for households losing sugar palm \ntrees will include assistance for women to \ndevelop alternative livelihoods. \n \nThe increased reliability of street lighting in \nPhnom Penh and street lighting for the first \ntime in villages along the transmission route, \nwill increase the sense of security, \nparticularly of women, and reduce \nrestrictions on social and livelihood activities.  \n \n \n\nInstalled capacity will be \nbetter matched to the low \nconsumption levels of the \npoor.

The main components of the Project \nwould  require  land  acquisition  of  8.94  hectares  (ha)  severely  affecting  15  paddy  rice  farmers, \nand  148  houses  and  1  commercial  enterprise,  which  would  need  to  be  relocated  (see  \nTable A11.1). Sixteen percent of structures can be moved out of the right of way (ROW) onto \nthe remaining land of their owners behind the ROW. The remaining 84% must move to another \nlocation  within  the  same  village.  There  are  also  approximately  7,000  economically  valuable \ntrees to be cleared from the ROWs. A total of 634 affected households have been identified as \nlosing land and/or structures. Except for land required for towers, the property owners can retain \nownership of the land within the ROW and can continue to use it for agricultural purposes. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement for Transmission Project \n \n\nComponents \n\nTotal \nland \nacquired \n(ha) \n\nOf \nwhich \npaddy \nland \n\nAffected \nhouseholds \n\nAffected \npopulation \n\nRelocated \nhouseholds \n\nRelocated \npersons \n\nDemolished \nfloor \nspaces \n(m2) \n\n220kV Line \n\n3.70 \n\n3.37 \n\n2,100 \n\n4682 \n\n1403 \n\n115kV Line \n\n0.04 \n\n0.04 \n\n500 \n\n305 \n\nSubtotal \n\n3.74 \n\n3.41 \n\n2,600 \n\n4987 \n\n149 \n\nWPP \n\nSubstation \n\nTakeo \n\nSubstation \n\n3.35 \n\n3.35 \n\n1.85 \n\n1.85 \n\nSubtotal \n\n5.20 \n\n5,20 \n\n15 \n\n45 \n\n35 \n\n80 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n370 \n\n100 \n\n470 \n\n8 \n\n7 \n\n800 \n\n45 \n\n845 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n9 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n      Total \n\n8.94 \n\n8.61 \n\n485 \n\n2,680 \n\n4987 \n\n149 \n\n845 \n\nNotes: 1.

This  summary  resettlement  plan  covers  all project \ncomponents  that  involve  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement:  the  220-  and  115-\nkilovolt transmission lines and the West Phnom Penh and Takeo substations and related access \nroads.  A  census  and  inventory  of  lost  assets  was  conducted  in  2001,  together  with  a \nsocioeconomic survey of 25% of affected households. The census was updated in 2003, as was \nthe  inventory  of  assets  for  the  severely  affected  relocating  households  and  severely  affected \nhouseholds  losing  agricultural  land  within  the  30-meter  right-of-way  of  the  transmission  lines \nand the substation sites. An resettlement plan (Supplementary Appendix C) has been prepared \nfor the Project in compliance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s)  Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice and the World \nBank\u2019s OP 4.12. The resettlement plan will be updated following detailed design during project \nimplementation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n48\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements. The policy framework and entitlements have built \n3. \nupon  the  laws  of  Cambodia,  principally  the  country\u2019s  1993  Constitution,  2001  Land  Law,  and \n2001 Electricity Law 2001; the draft national resettlement policy that was prepared with ADB\u2019s \nassistance;1  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995);  the  World  Bank\u2019s  operating \nprocedure  4.12;  and  Government-approved resettlement plans for other ADB and World Bank \nprojects.  Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  resettlement  plan  will  supersede  the \nprovisions of any relevant decrees wherever a gap exists. In the case of discrepancies between \nthe Government\u2019s procedures and the ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s requirements will apply. \n \n4. \n \n\nProject Principles. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  acquisition  of  land  and  other  assets  and  the  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized as much as possible by identifying possible alternative project designs \nand  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and  engineering  solutions  that \nhave the least impact on populations in the project area. \nThe populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may stand to \nlose,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  their  physical  and \nnonphysical assets, including homes,  homesteads, productive lands, commercial \nproperties,  tenancy,  income-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities \nand relationships, and other losses that may be identified during the process of \nresettlement planning. \nAll  those  affected  will  be  entitled  to  be  compensated  for  their  lost  assets, \nincomes,  and  businesses  at  full  replacement  cost  and  will  be  provided  with \nrehabilitation measures sufficient to help them improve, or at least maintain, their \npreproject living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels. \nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible \nfor  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding, and any other factors. \n\nEntitlement  Matrix.  The  entitlement  matrix  for  the  Project  (Table  A11.2)  summarizes \n\n \n5. \nthe main types of losses and the support entitlement for each type of loss. \n \n\nTypes of Losses \n\nLand \nAgricultural land \n\nTable A11.2: Summary Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nEntitlements \n\n \nCash compensation at replacement cost at current market value.

The social analysis shows that all those affected are Khmer. One-\nquarter of all households surveyed during the socioeconomic survey and one-third of severely \naffected  households  were  found  to  belong  to  a  vulnerable  group  (female-headed,  extremely \npoor, returnees, elderly, disabled, and children without means of support). Special attention will \nbe given to identifying and addressing the needs of vulnerable households.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nParticipatory  Process  of  Resettlement  Planning  and \n\nIncome Restoration. Agricultural households that are severely affected through a loss \n7. \nof  20%  or  more  of  their  productive  land  should  be  entitled  to  replacement  land  of  equal \nproductivity.  However,  all  farmers  losing  land  for  substations  have  indicated  a  preference  for \ncash  compensation  rather  than  land.  They  will  also  be  entitled  to  agricultural  extension \nassistance  for  increasing  productivity  or  diversifying  the  use  of  their  remaining  land.  Severely \naffected  owners  of  productive  trees  will  be  assisted  with  microcredit  and  alternative  livelihood \ndevelopment  through  existing  non-government  organizations  in  the  Project  area.  Loss  of \nbusiness and wages will be compensated during the transition period. \n \n8. \nImplementation  and \nGrievance  Mechanism.  Extensive  consultation  has  taken  place  since  the  first  surveys  were \nundertaken in 2000. Further resettlement planning and implementation will follow a participatory \napproach  of  consultation  to  finalize  replacement  costs,  relocation  and  income  restoration \noptions,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  impacts  and  benefits,  and  design  and  participation  in  a \ngrievance mechanism.  \n \nDisclosure.  Key  information  in  the  resettlement  plan,  including  compensation  and \n9. \nrehabilitation options, have been disclosed to the affected households and communities in the \nform  of  a  resettlement  information  brochure.  The  final  resettlement  plan,  or  its  summary,  will \nalso be displayed in a form and language that they can understand in an accessible place. The \nresettlement plan or this summary will be posted on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n10. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  Resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring \nwill be done under the guidance of consultants. The Project will assist Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n(EDC)  to  establish  and  build  the  capacity  of  a  social  and  environmental  unit.  EDC  will  put \ninstitutional arrangements in place to ensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation, \nand  implementation  in  relation  to  the  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation program. \n \n11.  Monitoring  the  Resettlement  Plan  Implementation  and  Impacts.  EDC  and    the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for monitoring internal resettlement. Before \nany  resettlement  activities  commence,  the  project  implementation  consultants  will  contract  a \nsuitably qualified nongovernment organization, social science institute, or domestic consultant to \ncarry out independent monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement process and its impacts .  \n \n12. \nCost  Estimates.  Replacement  costs  and  rates  have  been  established  in  consultation \nwith village administrations in the project areas. Final rates acceptable to those affected will be \ndetermined through further consultation during the detailed measurement survey. The estimated \ncost  for  resettlement  planning,  resettlement  plan  updating,  implementation,  and  income \nrestoration is $2.5 million.  \n \n13. \nImplementation  Schedule.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil \nworks schedule. The Government and ADB will not approve the commencement of civil works \nfor  any  component  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  until  the  Government  has \nsatisfactorily completed compensation payments and relocation to new sites in accordance with \nthe  approved  resettlement  plan  for  that  component  and  has  ensured  that  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2003) \n \nriel (KR) \n$0.00025 \nKR4,000 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", " Currency Unit \nKR1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nElectricity Authority of Cambodia \nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge  \neconomic internal rate of return \nElectricity of Viet Nam \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfiscal year \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nindependent power producer \nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nMinistry of Industry, Mines, and Energy \nmedium-voltage \nNordic Development Fund \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation consultant \npower purchase agreement \nrural electricity enterprise  \nspecial drawing rights \nvalue-added tax \nweighted average cost of capital  \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ADB \nEAC \nEDC \nEIRR \nEVN \nFIRR \nFY \nGDP \nGMS \nIPP \nMEF \nMIME \nMV \nNDF \nNPV \nO&M \nPIC \nPPA \nREE \nSDR \nVAT \nWACC \n", "GWh \nkm \nkV \nkWh \n", "MW \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "gigawatt-hour \nKilometer \nkilovolt (1,000 volts) \nkilowatt-hour  (the  energy  of  1  kW  of  capacity  operating  \nfor 1 hour) \nmegawatt (1,000,000 watts) \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(i) \n \n(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  M.
