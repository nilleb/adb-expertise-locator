The  Smallholder  Development  Project  (current \nproject)  has  therefore  been  promoting  sustainable  commercial  smallholder  agriculture  and \nassociated  agribusiness  through  strengthening  extension  services,  enhancing  access  to \ninformation  and  markets,  capacity  building,  and  increasing  investments  in  agribusiness.  The \nproposed  additional  financing,  which  will  consolidate  and  expand  well-performing  investments \ninitiated under the current project, covers eight new districts in the existing four provinces. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nAgriculture  is  the  dominant  sector  in  Lao  PDR,  accounting  for  about  40%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and more than 70% of employment. More than 85% of the population \nlives in rural areas, making a living largely by subsistence cultivation of rice. At the end of 2010, \nmore than 30% of the rural population was living in poverty. The incidence of poverty, which is \nclosely  linked  to  agricultural  performance,  can  be  reduced  by  moving  farmers  beyond \nsubsistence  farming  to  more  diversified  and  commercial  agricultural  production  of  cash  crops \nwith  ready  markets  in  neighboring  countries.  The  irrigated  floodplain  of  the  Mekong  River \nproduces  most  of  the  country\u2019s  marketable  surplus  of  rice  and  other  crops,  and  offers  the \nstrongest  potential  for  commercialization  of  agriculture.  However,  even  in  these  areas,  rice \nproductivity is below that of its neighbors. The productivity and quality of crops other than rice \nalso remain low because of limited information on markets, poor technical expertise, restricted \naccess to markets for inputs and products, lack of credit, low domestic demand, and a dearth of \nvalue-adding  enterprises.  The  extension  system  has  been  largely  dysfunctional  because  of \nsevere  budget  constraints,  poor  organization  and  staffing,  and  a  policy  environment  not \nconducive to the efficient functioning of input and product markets. By providing simple inputs, a \nlarge  impact  can  be  achieved,  mainly  through  training,  awareness  raising,  and  application  of \nappropriate policies.   \n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Smallholder \n4. \nDevelopment Project for $12 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources in November \n2002.2 The completion date was 30  June 2011 and the closing date 31 December 2011.3 The \npurpose  of  the  current  project  was  to  establish  sustainable  smallholder  agribusiness.  The \ncurrent  project  focused  on  (i) effective  agricultural  extension  and  training  mechanisms,  (ii) \nimproved physical infrastructure and marketing  of agricultural goods, and (iii) effective primary \nmarket networks. The current project has (i) established 162 farmer production and marketing \ngroups (FPMGs) and organized training on agricultural production techniques and post-harvest \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Smallholder Development Project. Manila (Loan \n1949-LAO and TA 4005-LAO). \n\n3  The original loan closing date of 31 October 2009 was extended to 31 December 2011 due to (i) startup delays in \nearlier years of implementation, and (ii) severe floods in July and August 2011 hindering the delivery of procured \npost harvest equipment and rice seeds to the project beneficiaries. \n\n\f2 \n\npractices;  (ii)  developed  agricultural  extension  services  to  assist  farmers\u2019  groups,  processors, \nand traders with the establishment of contract farming; (iii) upgraded 89.5 kilometers of access \nroads and built 70.8 kilometers of new feeder roads; (iv) delivered an agriculture and marketing \ninformation system; (v) constructed six markets; and (vi) provided post-harvest technology and \nassociated equipment. These investments created a favorable environment for the development \nof  commercial  agribusiness  and  contributed  to  the  improvement  of  farmers\u2019  incomes.  As  a \nresult,  the  outcomes  of  the  Project  have  largely  been  achieved.  An  average  beneficiary \nsmallholder household income in Khammouan  province, poorest among the project provinces, \nincreased to $675 in 2010 from $280 in 2002.4 The same trend has been observed in the other \nproject provinces.5 \n\n5. \nAs of 30 June 2011, overall physical progress was estimated at 99% against an elapsed \nloan  period  of  98%.  Total  cumulative  contract  awards  were  $12.8  million  (92%)  and \ndisbursements  were  $13.1  million  (94%).  The  rate  of  disbursements  and  contract  awards \nimproved significantly after the midterm review. No major issues were identified and applicable \nsafeguard policies have been observed. Since the midterm review, the Project has been rated \n\u2018satisfactory\u2019 in the project performance rating. Therefore, the current project is considered to be \nperforming well as stipulated in the Operations Manual Section H5/OP.6 \n\n6. \nThe current project has been successful in achieving the overall development objectives \nand  demonstrated  that  (i)  capacity  building  of  farmers\u2019  groups  is  vital  to  produce  surplus  for \nagricultural commercialization; (ii) knowledge transfer and exchange visits stimulate new ideas \namong FPMGs and encourages adoption of new agricultural techniques, and (iii) strengthening \nlinkages amongst all members along the marketing chain promotes greater appreciation of their \nrespective issues. Further, a number of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) were initiated. These \ninclude (i) collaboration between rice miller groups in the rice value chain and FPMGs, (ii) the \ninvolvement  of  trading  groups  in  contract  farming  arrangements  and  in  providing  extension \nservices and agriculture inputs to FPMGs, and (iii) cooperation with the Lao PDR\u2013India training \ncenter to train farmer groups and officials on entrepreneurship and marketing. \n\n7. \nDuring  the  loan  review  mission  conducted  by  ADB  Lao  PDR  Resident  Mission  in \nFebruary  2011,  the  government  requested  ADB  for  additional  financing  to  strengthen \nsustainable  smallholder  commercial  agriculture  by  consolidating  and  expanding  the  activities \nunder \nimplementation \narrangements,  the  additional  financing  will  replicate  well-performing  activities,  improve  the \nsustainability  of  existing  interventions,  and  add  eight  new  districts8 while  rationalizing  activities \nundertaken in the existing 16 districts of the current project. \n\nthe  current  project. 7  Building  on \n\nthe  established  capacity  and \n\n8. \nThe Project meets the four eligibility criteria for additional financing as stipulated in the \nOperations  Manual  H5/BP 9  -  (i)  the  overall  performance  of  the  current  project  is  rated \nsatisfactory and no significant changes in approaches and methodologies are envisioned. This \n\n                                                 \n4  Government of the Lao PDR. 2011. Project Monitoring and Evaluation Survey, 2011. Vientiane. \n5  The initial assessment of outcome and output achievements of the current project is in Initial Outcome and Output \n\nAchievements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. H5/OP. Manila (para. 3). \n7  The new districts have been selected based on the following criteria: (i) demonstrated farmer initiatives in farmer \norganizations  or  farmer  groups,  (ii)  sense  of  ownership  and  participation  shown,  (iii)  existence  of  basic \ninfrastructure such as access roads, and (iv) potential for the selected crops and rice. \n\n8  New  districts  include  Khong  and  Sanasomboun  in  Champassak,  Mahaxai  and  Xebanfai  in  Khammouan, \n\nAtsaphangthong and Phalanxay in Savannakhet and Kasi and Xanakham in Vientiane provinces. \n\n9  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. H5/BP. Manila (para. 4). \n \n\n\f3 \n\nwill  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially \nsound;  (ii)  the  government  accords  the  Project  high  priority  through  its  request  for  additional \nfinancing; (iii) while project outputs will be expanded to reach more beneficiaries, the Project will \nretain the same overall objectives; and (iv) the outcome is consistent with the current  country \npartnership strategy (CPS)10 which promotes agriculture and rural development in the context of \nsustainable economic growth and improved livelihoods of vulnerable groups. \n\n9. \nThe  Project  has  a  substantial  degree  of  readiness.  The  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  (the  Executing  Agency)  and  the  National  Agriculture  Forestry \nExtension  Service  (NAFES)  (the  Implementing  Agency)  has  improved  over  the  course  of  the \ncurrent project implementation. Additional financing is considered to be a suitable instrument to \npromptly  respond  to  the  government\u2019s  needs  and  sustain  the  development  momentum  of  the \ncurrent  project.  Therefore,  the  overall  project  will  enhance  the  positive  impacts  of  sustainable \nsmallholder commercial agriculture and improve livelihoods through PPPs for agribusiness. The \nestablishment  of  PPPs  will  enhance  and  sustain  agriculture  production  techniques  and \nmarketing in the project areas. \n\n10. \nSustainable agricultural practices promoted by the Project will generate climate change \nbenefits  by  building  more  climate  resilient  agrisystems  and  reducing  agricultural  greenhouse \ngas emissions. Management practices and approaches to organic farming will optimize use of \n(i)  bio-pesticides  and  minimum  tillage  systems;  (ii)  natural,  locally  available  nutrients,  mostly \nfrom  manure,  crop  residues,  and  weed  biomass;  and  (iii)  nitrogen-fixing  legumes  grown  in \nrotation.  The  interventions  will  promote  carbon  sequestration  and  soil  stabilization  through \nincreased storage of carbon in soil and plant biomass. \n\n11.  While the current project was classified in the some gender benefit category, the active \nparticipation  of  women  was  evident  during  its  implementation.  It  involved  women  in  various \ncapacity  development  activities  such  as  entrepreneurial  and  group  management  training, \nagribusiness  workshops,  and  strategic  community  dialogue.  Women  took  the  lead  in  organic \nvegetable farming, corn production, food processing, and rice miller groups. The participation of \nwomen  in  study  tours  and  farmer  exchanges  has  demonstrated  that  entrepreneurship  and \nmarketing  skills  of  women  have  improved.  Women  took  the  initiative  in  preparing  strategic \nproduction and marketing plans in farmer groups. This momentum needs to be continued and \nstrengthened.  The  overall  project  will  give  priority  to  women  beneficiaries  in  implementing  the \nplanned activities, and encourage more women to participate in project implementation, benefit \nmonitoring, dissemination of project achievements, and evaluation of project performance. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  agricultural  productivity.  The \n12. \noutcome  will  be \nin \nChampassak,  Khammouan,  Savannakhet,  and  Vientiane  provinces.  The  outcome  and  impact \nstatements  of  the  Project  have  been  updated  to  better  reflect  the  focus  on  smallholder \nagriculture productivity and sustainability. \n\nimproved  sustainability  of  smallholder  commercial  agriculture \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n10 The  CPS  focuses  on  five  core  areas:  (i)  education;  (ii)  agriculture,  natural  resources  management,  environment, \nand climate change; (iii) urban development including water supply and sanitation; (iv) public sector management; \nand (v) energy.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe project design considered lessons learned from the current project, particularly with \nregard  to  the  replication  of  integrated  agribusiness  models,  expansion  of  organic  farming  and \npost-harvesting  practices,  and  strengthening  of  the  capacity  of  farmer  groups  in  production \ntechniques. The Project will have five outputs. \n\n14. \nOutput  1:  Strengthened  farmer  production  and  marketing  groups.

As of July 2011, the cost of the \ncurrent  project  was  $15.23  million  equivalent,  financed  by  an  ADF  loan  of  $12.00  million \nequivalent (denominated in SDR). The overall project is estimated to cost $20.73 million. \n\n21. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,155,000 \n($5.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan will be used for civil works, vehicles \nand  equipment,  training  and  workshops,  consulting  services,  incremental  operating  costs, \ninterest  during  implementation,  contingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  government  has \nrequested ADB to (i) consider approval of advance contracting for civil works13 and goods; and \n(ii)  retroactive  financing  of  about  $500,000  for  consulting  services,  civil  works,  and  goods \ncontract packages. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nOriginal \nProject \n\nAmount Additional \nFinancinga \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The existing implementation arrangements for the current project will be \nretained  with  minor  changes  to  reduce  implementation  costs  and  improve  implementation \nefficiency.  The  Office  of  the  National  Project  Director  (ONPD)  will  continue  to  provide  overall \ncoordination. Additional staff will be recruited for eight district coordination offices. The ongoing \nnational  project  steering  committee  chaired  by  MAF  will  provide  overall  guidance  on  project \nimplementation.  Other  existing  organizations  will  be  retained  and  include  staff  of  NAFES,  the \nprovincial agriculture and forestry offices, ATEC, and the district agriculture and forestry offices. \nThe project implementation period will be from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n24. \nProject impact can be expected to be similar to that of the current project. Selection of \nthe  targeted  villages  was  carried  out  through  various  consultation  meetings  and  government \nprocedures  in  the  field  and  follows  provincial  and  district  development  strategies.  Economic \nbenefits, financial viability, and project sustainability were analyzed based on the demonstrated \nperformance of the current project. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n25. \nA  national  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  MAF,  has \nfunctioned well to provide oversight on implementation and coordination. ONPD has effectively \ncoordinated with relevant agencies involved in the project implementation. The implementation \narrangements  at  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels,  established  under  the  current  project, \nhave  proved  to  be  effective.  These  existing  structures  will  provide  a  platform  for  the  smooth \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  provide  the  opportunity  for  active  participation  by  farmers. \nPost-harvest techniques, extension services, and new agricultural initiatives of organic farming \nprovided by the current project have demonstrated their relevance with farmers benefiting from \nhigher  incomes  and  improved  livelihoods.  The  agribusiness  models  established  under  the \ncurrent  project  have  been  effective  and  were  important  in  supporting  commercialization  of \nagriculture under the framework of the Lao PDR agriculture sector strategy and master plan. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB  and  the  government  agreed  on  counterpart  funding  in-kind  during  the  CPS  consultations  since  the \n\ngovernment faces challenges in providing cash contributions. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  include  (i)  improved  agricultural  productivity \namongst  direct  farmer  group  beneficiaries  and  those  who  can  benefit  indirectly  from  project \nactivities, (ii) improved household incomes amongst participating farmers, (iii) an expanded area \nof  influence  for  project  interventions,  (vi)  more  diversified  farming  household  income  sources \nthrough  the introduction of  higher  valued  commodities,  (v)  improved  input  supply  mechanisms \nthrough group initiatives for credit, equipment, animal health products, fertilizer, and agricultural \nmachinery,  (vi)  enhanced  technical  and  communication  capacities  amongst  extension  staff \nwithin  MAF,  (vii)  strengthened  PPPs  for  agribusiness,  and  (viii)  improved  technical  and \nmanagement  capacities  amongst  target  rural  communities.  The  economic  analysis  of  the \nadditional  financing  indicates  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  22.4%  based  on \nquantified  incremental  benefits  from  increased  productivity  in  wet  and  dry  season  rice,  maize, \nvegetables and from livestock production. While the reassessment of the current project shows \nan  EIRR  of  16.3%,15 the  combined  impact  is  to  elevate  the  EIRR  to  an  estimated  16.9%.  The \ninvestment  is  sensitive  to  price  decreases  in  rice  but  this  risk  is  considered  minimal  as \nconservative  estimates  were  used  in  the  analysis.  Overall  the  Project  is  considered  a  sound \ninvestment contributing to economic growth of the area, to farmer household incomes that will \nfurther reduce poverty as benefits are broadly distributed.16 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  in  relation  to  project  activities.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). The \nProject  will  assist  provincial  and  district  administrations  in  addressing  governance  issues.  The \ninvolvement  of  communities  and  extension  workers  in  project  implementation  is  expected  to \nincrease the transparency of project-related decision-making and accountability. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe  Project  is  located  in  provinces  and  districts  primarily  contiguous  to  the  Mekong \nRiver. Thus, most of these districts are not among the poorest in the Lao PDR. However, of the \n16 districts where the project has been implemented since 2002, two in Champassak are rated \namong the 45 poorest districts nationally. Of the eight new districts, Phalanxay in Savannakhet \nis  rated  as  among  the  poorest  with  over  11%  poor  households.  Of  the  64,400  households  in \nnew districts, 1,830 are considered poor. Of the total, 3,930 households belong to various ethnic \ngroups, and 270 are households headed by women. The overall project will enable households \nto  benefit  from  increased  trade  and  economic  growth  through  effective  agricultural  extension \nand marketing efforts. The eight new districts have villages with the same ethnic heterogeneity \nas in the current project. Villages are not remote and have a long history of cross-cultural and \neconomic  interaction  with  other  groups.  They  are  all  involved,  at  different  levels,  in  some \ncommercial  activities.  The  Project  has  been  screened  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). As project processes are highly participatory, involvement in activities \nis based on the household\u2019s willingness to participate. \n\n29. \nThe main gender issues in smallholder development are low productivity among women \nproducers;  limited  knowledge,  credit,  and  skills  to  engage  in  alternative  income-generating \n                                                 \n15 At appraisal, the EIRR estimate  was 19.9%. Due to startup delays, benefit streams  were slow to materialize and \n\nthe reassessed EIRR at project completion was 16.3%. \n\n16 Details are in the economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n\f8 \n\nactivities such as agribusinesses, resulting in risk adverse attitudes; limited access to extension \nservices;  limited  knowledge  of  marketing;  and  limited  participation  in  FPMGs.  An  important \nlesson learned from the current project is the need for explicit attention to gender equality such \nas  setting  targets  for  women\u2019s  participation.  The  overall  project  will  address  this  issue  by \nintroducing  gender-inclusive  design  features  and  targets,  which  are  reflected  in  the  gender \naction  plan. 17  The  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  by  ONPD, \nassisted by a national gender and development specialist. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironmental  safeguards  (category  B).  None  of  the  proposed  activities  directly \nimpinges upon the environment. The Project will have limited environmental impact and, in all \nsuch  cases,  effective  mitigation  measures  can  be  designed.  Promotion  of  sustainable  farming \nand  associated  marketing  activities  will  have  beneficial  environmental  impacts.  Village  post-\nharvest  operations  are  small-scale  and  will  therefore  have  no  negative  environmental  impact. \nAwareness-raising  activities  will  increase  community  consciousness  of  the  need  to  follow \nsustainable  practices.  In  addition,  no  new  construction  of  major  facilities  or  physical \ninfrastructure  is  planned.  Following  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework,  a  screening  process  will  be  established  to  categorize  subproject \nactivities  according \ninitial \nenvironmental examinations and environmental management plans will be updated to address \nsite-specific  issues  consistent  with  government  requirements  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  An  environmental  safeguard  specialist  will  assist  project  staff  in  complying \nwith the requirements and monitor these procedures. \n\ntheir  environmental  sensitivity.  Where  needed,  existing \n\nto \n\n31. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The Project has been screened for involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  against  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  Project  activities  will  not  involve  any  involuntary  acquisition  of  land  or  assets,  and  no \ncompensation will be required. None of the project components, activities, or community works \n(e.g.,  construction  of  community  rice  drying  facilities,  training  rooms,  and  rice  storage)  is \nexpected to entail any land acquisition, conversion, donation, or restrictions of access that will \ntrigger ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). \n\n32. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The purpose of the Project remains the promotion of \ncommercial  smallholder  agriculture  and  associated  agribusiness  in  the  Lao  PDR,  with  the \noverall objectives of achieving sustained increases in rural incomes and long-term reductions in \nrural poverty through growth of the commercial agriculture sector. Guiding principles of village \nselection  to  achieve  this  aim  remain  the  same,  namely  in  areas  with  high  potential  for \nagribusiness and where farmers are already linked to external markets. The Project is not being \ncarried  out  in  remote  upland  areas  characterized  by  higher  numbers  of  poorer  ethnic  groups. \nHouseholds from different ethnic groups in the overall project area have largely assimilated into \na  settled  agricultural  production  economy,  and  there  continues  to  be  no  significant  difference \nbetween ethnic groups, their needs, demands, social functioning, and development objectives. \nHousehold participation in the Project is based on individual willingness or interest determined \nthrough  a  community  consultation  process.  Safeguards  screening  against  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  indicates  that  no  adverse  effects  on  different  ethnic  groups  are \nanticipated  and  no  commercial  development  of  cultural  or  natural  resources  is  involved. \n\n                                                 \n17 The Project is categorized as \u201cEffective Gender Mainstreaming\u201d. The Gender Action Plan is accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nOpportunities  under  the  overall  project  for  developing  commercial  agriculture  are  directed \ntowards households from all different ethnic groups that seek to take advantage of smallholder \nengagement in commercial agricultural production. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe  overall  project  is  categorized  as  \u201clow  risk\u201d  as  (i)  the  loan  amount  is  $5  million; \n(ii) post-harvest  technologies  have  been  tested  and  proven  to  be  technically  viable;  (iii)  MAF \nand NAFES have gained the necessary experience and skills to implement the overall project; \nand (iv) the safeguard categorization is other than A. A risk assessment and risk management \nplan  was  prepared. 18 Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited capacity of new district staff \n\nLimited coordination among key stakeholders \ninvolved in agribusiness \n\nMitigating Measure \n\nThe Project will build the capacity of the staff \nthrough training in project administration, finance, \nand procurement. \nThe Project will address this through consultation \nmeetings and training of local officials, and facilitate \npolicy dialogue between officials and agribusiness \ngroups.\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n34. \nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  overall  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan agreement. \n\nThe government and MAF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the Project, \n\n35. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR  3,155,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the \nadditional  financing  of  the  Smallholder  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32-years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n27 October 2011 \n                                                 \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fDesign Summary \n(Current Project) \n\nDesign Summary \n(Overall Project) \n\nImpact \nEconomic growth, \nemployment creation, \nand income growth \n\n \nImproved agricultural \nproductivity in four \nprovinces \n \n(Updated and clarified) \n\nOutcome \nEstablishment of \nsustainable smallholder-\ncommercial agriculture \nand associated \nagribusiness in the \nprovinces of \nChampassak, \nKhammouan, \nSavannakhet, and  \nVientiane \n\n \nImproved sustainability \nof smallholder \ncommercial agriculture \nin the provinces of \nChampassak, \nKhammouan, \nSavannakhet, and \nVientiane \n \n(Updated and clarified) \n \n\n1\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n \n\ni\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n(Current Project) \n\n \nCommercial crop \nproduction increases by \n30,000 tons per year by \n2010 \n \n \nPercentage of \nhouseholds in rice \ndeficit in project area \ndeclines from 22% to \n11% by 2010 \n\n \n54,000 households have \nimproved incomes by \nthe end of the project \n \nWet season rice yields \nincrease from 2.5 to 3.0 \ntons per ha in project \ndistricts. \n \nDry season rice yields \nincrease from 2.8 to 3.2 \ntons per ha in project \ndistricts \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n(Overall Project) \n\n \nCommercial crop \nproduction increases to \n50,000 tons by 2014 \nfrom 30,000 tons in \n2010 \n \nPercentage of \nbeneficiary households  \nunable to produce or \nbuy rice requirements \ndeclines from 5% in \n2010 to 0% by 2014 \n \n64,400 households have \nimproved incomes by \n2014 \n \nWet season rice yields \nincrease from 2.5 to 3.0 \ntons per ha in old and \nnew project districts by \n2014 \nDry season rice yields \nincrease from 2.8 to 3.2 \ntons per ha in old and \nnew project districts by \n2014 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n(Overall Project) \n\n \nProvincial annual \nagricultural production \nstatistics \n \n \n \nProject survey on rice \ndeficits amongst project \nhouseholds \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n(Overall Project) \n\nAssumptions\nNational policies and \neconomic management \nsupport a stable \ninvestment climate \n \n \nRegional and sub-\nregional demand for the \nLao PDR agricultural \nproducts is sustained \n\n \nLECS (compared with \npre-project baseline) \n \n \nProvincial annual \nagricultural production \nstatistics \n \n \nProvincial annual \nagricultural production \nstatistics \n\nAssumptions \nNo extreme climatic \nevents experienced \n \nThe government \ncontinues to support \nagribusiness \ndevelopment \n \nProject households \ncontinue to have access \nto financial services \n\nOutputs \n1.
