Consulting  services  will  be \nprovided  to  prepare  detailed  design  and  support  implementation \nof  the  civil  works.  These  proposed  road  sections  provide  access \nto the border crossings and have significant regional implications. \nRoad  improvement  and  construction  works  under  the  Project \ninclude  construction  of  roadways,  including  longitudinal  drainage \nstructures, installation of culverts and bridges, construction of new \nbridges  and  cross-drainage  structures,  and  structures \nfor \nresettlement and rehabilitation. \n \nThe Project will also enhance overall sector management capacity \nby providing (i) equipment necessary for the Royal Government of \nBhutan  to  enhance  sector  capacity  in  areas  such  as  (a)  quality \nsurvey,  design,  and  construction,  (b)  road  safety,  and  (c)  control \nof  overloading  and  vehicle  emissions;  (ii)  on-the-job  training  for \nsocial  and  environmental  requirements  through  detailed  design \nand  construction  supervision  consultants;  and  (iii)  technical \nassistance (TA) to support the capacity building of the Department \nof  Roads  (DoR),  including  (a)  enhancing  knowledge  of  and  skills \nin  modern  road  technologies,  especially  with  environmental \nconsiderations;  and  (b)  enhancing  and  optimizing  the  road  asset \nmanagement systems. \n \nAccessibility  is  Bhutan\u2019s  key  development  issue\u2014the  trunk  road \nnetwork  is  dependent  on  a  single  east\u2013west  national  highway \nrunning through the northern part of the country. The absence of a \nsimilar  east\u2013west  highway  running \nthe  south  has \nconstrained  travel  in  the  southern  part  and  hence  development \nIndia.

The proposed Project will construct critical sections of \nthe  southern  east\u2013west  highway,  which  will  facilitate  industrial \ndevelopment  in  the  southern  areas  and  integrate  them  more \neffectively with their primary markets in India. \n \nin  charge  of  road  development  and \nThe  DoR,  which \nmanagement,  is  limited  by  traditional  road-building  technologies, \nwhich often lead to cost and time overruns in project delivery. For \nefficient  and  effective road  asset  development  and management, \nthe  DoR  needs  to  be  equipped  with  knowledge,  skills,  and  tools \nfor  the  use  of  modern  technologies  in  planning,  survey,  design, \nand  construction,  especially  with \nto  environmental \nconsiderations.  Improved  road  safety  and  control  of  overloading \nand vehicle emissions  are also required for the safe and efficient \nuse of road assets with minimal adverse environmental impacts. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  passenger  and  freight  transport  within \nthe  country and with India, facilitate industrial development in the \nsouth of the country, a remote area with a high poverty incidence \nbut  high  agricultural  and  industrial  development  potential.  It  will \nalso integrate the  south more  effectively  with  its primary  markets \nin India. The Project will expand the road transport network in the \nsouthern  region,  providing  a  major  internal  transit  route  for \nBhutanese  passengers  and  goods  (i.e.,  an  alternative  to  the \nexisting east\u2013west national highway running through the northern \npart of the country), connecting to border crossings with India. \n \nThe investment cost  of the project is estimated at $54.32 million, \nincluding taxes and duties.  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  grant  of  $38.76  million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, inclusive of a $10.00 \nmillion grant from the subregional pool of the Asian Development \nFund.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  local  cost  of \n$15.56  million  equivalent,  or  28.6%  of  the  total  cost,  including \ntaxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition,  remuneration  of  counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, and other miscellaneous costs. \n \n30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n \nDepartment of Roads (DoR) \n \nThe  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  headed  by  a  full-\ntime project coordinator at the executive engineer level, supported \nby adequate technical and administrative personnel. The PMO will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  overall  coordination,  management  and \nmonitoring  of  the  Project,  (ii)  supervision  of  detailed  engineering \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii \n\ndesign,  and  (iii)  procurement.  In  addition  to  the  PMO,  two  site \noffices  shall  be  established  to  be responsible for monitoring  day-\nto-day  implementation  of  the  Project  and  preparation  of  project \nprogress reports, each to be headed by a project manager at the \nassistant engineer level. \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive  bidding  with  domestic  margin  of  preference.  ADB  is \ncurrently  updating  the  list  of  countries  eligible  for  domestic \npreference,  which  will  be  issued  shortly.  If  Bhutan  is  not  on  the \nupdated  list  of  eligible  countries  at  the  time  of  bidding,  the \ndomestic preference referred to elsewhere in this report will not be \napplicable to this Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  $1  million  for  equipment  to  be  procured \nand  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  the \nestimated  contract  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000,  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures if the estimated contract is valued \nbetween  $100,000  and  $500,000,  and  shopping  if  the  estimated \ncontract amount is less than $100,000. \n \nTwo  international  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited:  one  for \ndetailed  design  and  procurement  assistance,  and  another  for \nconstruction supervision of civil works under the Project. The DoR \nwill  select  and  engage the  consultants  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n \nFor  detailed  design  and  procurement  assistance,  about  34 \nperson-months of international consultants and 32 person-months \nof  national  consultants  will  be  required.  For  construction \nsupervision,  an  estimated  28  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 604 person-months of national consultants will be \nprovided. \n \nImproving management of the country's road network through the \ncapacity  building  component  and  the TA,  and  the  construction  of \ncritical  sections  of  the  country's  trunk  road  network  under  the \nProject,  will  enhance  rural  accessibility  in  the  southern  area  as \nwell  as  expand  the  country's  trunk  road  network  by  providing  an \nalternate  east\u2013west  link.  This  will  reduce  poverty  incidence  and \nimprove the quality of life in the remote southern areas. It will also \nintegrate \nthe  national  and  subregional \neconomies  through  reduced  travel  time,  accidents,  overloading, \nand  vehicle  emissions.  The  Project  will  increase  the  DoR's \ncapacity  for  road  asset  development  and  management.  This  will \nensure the delivery of more efficient road asset development and \nmanagement,  and  higher-quality  construction  and  maintenance, \n\nthese  areas  with \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nresulting  in  decreased  recurrent  costs  in  the  medium  and  long \nterm. These will increase the overall level of social and economic \ndevelopment in Bhutan.  \n \nRemoteness  and  isolation  are  the  major  causes  of  poverty  in \nBhutan.  The  Project  will  improve  access  to  socioeconomic \nincome-\nincrease  employment  opportunities  and \nservices, \ngeneration activities, and improve transport services. These major \npositive impacts of the Project will significantly reduce poverty and \nimprove the quality of life in the project-influenced areas covering \nfive  dzongkhags  (districts):  Chhukha,  Dagana,  Pemagatshel, \nSamdrupjongkhar, and Zhemgang. \n \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation  will  be  mitigated  through  (i) \nreview  of \nthe  DoR\u2019s  advance  actions  and  ADB's  prior \nprocurement,  (ii)  more  hands-on  advice  during  procurement \nprocesses, and (iii) on-the-job training on safeguard requirements \nto the DoR and dzongkhag officials. The DoR will provide required \nsupport to dzongkhag offices to facilitate land acquisition. \n \nThe  risk  of  ad  hoc  design  changes,  which  could  result  in \nrealignment leading to implementation delay, has been minimized \nthrough  full  consultation  with  local  communities  and  dzongkhag \nofficials. Technical advice will be provided by the consultant under \nthe  attached  TA  and  design  and  supervision  consultants  on \nappropriate \ntechnologies  with  environmental  considerations, \nwhich  will  ensure  projects  are  implemented  in  a  timely  manner \nand are of high quality. \n \nThe  risk  of  inadequate  maintenance  financing  is  mitigated  with \ncontinued  support  to  asset  management  planning  through  the \nattached  TA.  Sufficient  budget  was  allocated  to  the  targeted \nlength  under  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan,  and  the  target  length  and \nbudget were increased under the 10th Five-Year Plan. \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  TA  will  be  provided  for  capacity \nbuilding  of  the  DoR.  The  DoR  will  be  equipped  with  skills  in  and \nknowledge  of  modern  road  technologies  in  planning,  survey, \ndesign,  and  construction,  with  environmental  considerations.  The \nestimated  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $500,000,  of  which  ADB  will \nfinance  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA  funding \nprogram \n(Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV).  The  TA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n1. \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Network Project II. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Capacity Building of the Department of Roads, and if the Board \napproves  the  proposed  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIn  a  landlocked  country  such  as  Bhutan,  socioeconomic  development  depends  largely \non  an  efficient  and  reliable  road  network.  Since  the  construction  of  the  179-kilometer  (km) \nPhuentsholing\u2013Thimphu  Highway  in  1959,  the  national  road  network  has  expanded  to  about \n4,947 km of motorable roads, including 1,632 km of national highways, 489 km of district roads, \n813  km  of  feeder  roads,  150  km  of  urban  roads,  717  km  of  farm  roads,  and  560  km  of  forest \nroads. This  gives  a  road  density  of  0.13 km  per square km  and  7.5 km per  1,000  inhabitants. \nThe km per inhabitants figure is relatively high in comparison with countries of similar size and \nincome  level;  this  is  due  to Bhutan\u2019s low  population  density.  Despite  the extent  of the  present \nroad  network,  many  rural  communities  remain  unconnected.  The  census  survey  of  2005 \nindicates that 9.7% of the population lives more than 6 hours away from the nearest road, and \nthat rural households in six districts comprise 73% of such population. Travel between east and \nwest regions relies on a single east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of \nthe country, or it requires going through India, especially in southern areas of the country. Only \none airport provides limited air access to the rest of the world. \n \n3. \nAlmost all national highways (95%), more than 90% of the district and urban roads, and \nabout 20% of feeder  roads are paved. However, road conditions are poor. Narrow roads have \nbeen  built  along  steep  hillsides  prone  to  landslides.  Roads  become  difficult  to  use  during  the \nwinter  months  and  rainy  season.  Improvement,  maintenance,  and  expansion  of  the  existing \nroad network are urgently needed. Because of the mountainous terrain, the area of land suitable \nfor  agriculture  is  limited  and  the  population  of  less  than  700,000  is  distributed  in  remote \nsettlements.  This  makes  construction  and  maintenance  of  roads  extremely  difficult  and  costly. \nThe wide use of manual resurfacing has provided low-quality pavement. \n \n4. \nThe  Department  of  Roads  (DoR)  under  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement \nhas  direct  responsibility  for  2,449  km  of  road  network,  comprising  1,125  km  of  national \nhighways,  419  km  of  district  roads,  805  km  of  feeder  roads,  and  100  km  of  urban  roads. \nDANTAK,  an  organization  under  the  Army  Engineering  Corp  of  the  Indian  Border  Force,  has \nconstructed  and  maintained  the  country's  main  road  network  since  1959  and  continues  to \nmaintain 12% of Bhutan's main road network under a grant from the Government of India. Farm \nroads,  forest  roads,  and  some  feeder  roads  are  managed  by  the  Departments  of  Agriculture, \nForestry  and  Education,  and  local  roads  and  mule  tracks  are  the  responsibility  of  local \ngovernment authorities. The DoR is also responsible for managing the national workforce, which \nhas been primarily employed for force-account road construction and maintenance works. \n \n5. \nBudgetary  expenditure  of  the  DoR  under  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP,  2002\u20132007, \nextended  to  2008)  was  Nu7,418  million  ($161  million)  against  an  original  budget  of  Nu6,566 \nmillion  ($143 million). The  substantial increase in  expenditure  was  due  to  extension  of the  9th \nFYP to 2008. The average annual expenditure was Nu1,236 million against the original average \n\n\fannual  expenditure  of  Nu1,313  million,  which  is  6%  underspending.  This  demonstrates \nremarkable  improvement  in  the  DoR's  capacity  and  commitment.  Under  the  10th  FYP  (2008\u2013\n2013), the budget is 1.8  times (2.2 times on the annual basis) as large as the 9th FYP due to \nthe newly elected government\u2019s priority for road rehabilitation and development.  \n \n6. \nSpecific charges for road use are taxes on motor vehicles levied by the Road Safety and \nTransport Authority (RSTA), including annual registration, renewal, and ownership transfer fees, \nand  these  were  Nu97  million  in  2008,  increasing  from  Nu60  million  in  2005.  In  addition,  road \nusers  pay  sales  tax  on  fuel,  and  custom  duties  and  sales  tax  on  vehicles,  which  were  Nu121 \nmillion in 2005 and Nu152 million in 2008. Revenue relating to road use was Nu249 million in \n2008,  increasing  from  Nu181  million  in  2005,  which  is  absorbed  into  the  general  government \nrevenue. The average annual increase was very high at 15.6%. \n \n7. \nThe RSTA of the Ministry of Information and Communications is responsible for all motor \nvehicle-related  activities  including  registration  and  licensing  and  roadworthiness  and  emission \ntests.  The  number  of  motor  vehicle  registrations  increased  from  29,914  in  2005  to  35,703  in \n2007, which is an average annual increase of 9.2%. The highest increase was in light vehicles \nat  13%,  and  there  was  not  much  increase  in  two-wheelers.  Out  of  35,703  motor  vehicles \nregistered,  over  60%  were  light  vehicles  and  taxis,  20%  were  two-wheelers,  and  13%  were \nheavy vehicles.  \n \n8. \nThe  RSTA  regulates  the  transport  industry  and  sets  tariffs.  The  tariffs  are  binding  for \npassenger  traffic  but  considered  indicative  for  freight.  Large  transport  contracts  are  generally \ncontracted out by industries in open tender to both transport companies and truck owners. The \nfreight transport market is fully competitive. The size of the truck fleet has risen significantly in \nrecent  years  and  increased  competition  is  reported.  For  passenger  transport,  all  bus  services \nwere privatized by October 1999. As of June 2009, the RSTA had 124 bus routes covering 18 \ndzongkhags  (except  Gasa  and  Pemagatshel),  currently  operated  by  35  private  operators, \nexcluding  city  buses,  which  is  above  the  RSTA  public  transport  target  in  the  10th  FYP  of  170 \nbuses  in  operation.  New  routes  proposed  by  either  private  operators  or  the  RSTA  will  be \ncontracted out through open competition with passenger fares regulated by the RSTA with the \ndirect  cost  plus  operational  overhead.  Public  demand  for  transport  services  has  been \nincreasing,  and  the  frequency  of  service  has  increased  and  operation  hours  have  expanded. \nDemands for more routes will further grow with the construction of many new roads. The RSTA \nintroduced measures to encourage private operators to offer better services: waiving of import \nduty for purchasing new buses, and extending operation contracts to 10 years. \n \n9. \nThe Road Safety and Transport Act of 1999 defines the roles of the RSTA and the traffic \npolice  in  implementing  the  road  traffic  safety  rules.  The  act  reflects  modern  practice  and  the \ntraffic  safety  rules  are  in  line  with  international  standards.  Despite  rapid  traffic  growth,  the \nnumber of reported accidents decreased from 1,039 accidents with 22 fatalities in 2005 to 858 \naccidents  with  18  fatalities  in  2007.  This  translates  to  5  annual  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles, \nwhich is low in comparison with lower and middle-income countries, where the range is 5\u2013100 \nannual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  1.  Appendix  2 \n\n10. \nprovides more details of the road sector in Bhutan.   \n\n 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nMain Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n\n \n11. \nDespite the expansion of the road network, the coverage and condition of the country's \nroad  network  needs  improving,  and  the  demands  of  road  transport  are  increasing.  One  of  the \nmajor  concerns  with  Bhutan's  trunk  road  network  is  that  the  country  is  dependent  on  a  single \neast\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the country. The absence of a \nsimilar east\u2013west highway running through the south has constrained travel in the south. \n \nUnder  the  10th  FYP,  the  construction  of  the  Southern  East\u2013West  Highway  is  a  major \n12. \nroad  infrastructure  development  priority,  in  addition  to  road  construction  connecting  to \nhydropower  projects.  The  country\u2019s  southern  regions  hold  the  greatest  promise  for  industrial \ngrowth,  as  evidenced  by  industrial  developments  in  selected  areas  that  already  benefit  from \nconnectivity. Additionally, the Southern East\u2013West Highway will also provide an internal transit \nroute  for  Bhutanese  passengers  and  goods,  i.e.,  an  alternative  to  the  existing  east\u2013west \nnational  highway  running  through  the  northern  part  of  the  country.  The  Southern  East\u2013West \nHighway  will  facilitate  industrial  development  in  the  southern  economic  hubs  and  special \neconomic zones, and integrate them more effectively with their primary markets in India. Being \na landlocked country, road access plays a vital part in the trade and commerce of Bhutan. India \nis the largest trading partner accounting for 90% of the country's imports and 70% of its exports. \nBhutan's  trade  and  economic  communications  with  other  South  Asian  countries  depends  on \nroute through India. Currently, there  is only  one  road corridor that  connects Bhutan with India, \nlocated  in  western  Bhutan.  To  increase  trade  flows,  reduce  transaction  costs,  and  provide \ngreater regional integration of the national road network and better trade facilities, the Southern \nEast\u2013West  Highway  will  connect  to  border  access  points,  thus  improving  regional  road \nconnections between Bhutan and India, and through India to Bangladesh and Nepal. The 10th \nFYP  also  gives  priority  to  continued  maintenance  and  management  of  road  assets,  quality \nassurance and standardization, and strengthening of the road construction industry. \n \n\na. \n\nDepartment of Roads Capacity Building \n\n \n13. \nUntil  the  early  1990s,  there  was  only  a  very  limited  role  for  Government  staff,  local \nengineers,  and  contractors  in  road  planning,  construction,  and  management  until  the  early \n1990s.  Since  the  8th  FYP  (1997\u20132002),  the  Government  and  domestic  private  sector \ncontractors have gained experience in road sector development and management, and the total \nDoR budget under the 10th FYP is Nu13.7 billion. To manage the large investment in roads, the \nDoR has initiated capacity strengthening  and the streamlining of its business procedures. One \nof the major initiatives includes corporatization of the mechanical division with the establishment \nof the Construction Development Corporation (CDC) in July 2007. Utilization of equipment and \nwork efficiency of the CDC has been increased. \n \nThe DoR will continue to further strengthen its capacity in both the policy and planning \n14. \nand engineering and technical aspects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has \nprovided engineers on a long-term basis to the DoR to strengthen its engineering capacity. SNV \nBhutan has provided experts to provide training for design and construction with environmental \nconsiderations.  Under  the  proposed  attached  TA,  assistance  will  be  provided  in  asset \nmanagement  and  road  technologies  of  survey,  design,  and  construction,  and  especially  on \nenvironmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) methods. \n \n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nb. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing \n\n \n\n \n\n15. \nDuring the extended 9th FYP (2002\u20132008), the expenditure on resurfacing was Nu1,215 \nmillion for 1,285 km and for routine maintenance was Nu623 million for 2,307 km. The average \ncost per km of Nu945,000 for resurfacing and Nu45,000 for routine maintenance is considered \nappropriate.  The  average  annual  length  scheduled  for  resurfacing  was  214  km,  which  is \nconsidered to be about a 7-year resurfacing period. \n \n16. \nUnder  the  10th FYP,  the  budget for  resurfacing  is Nu1,389 million for  a  planned  1,415 \nkm, and for routine maintenance Nu784 million. The budget per km is considered adequate and \nthe average annual length for resurfacing is about 280 km, which is about a 30% increase from \nthe 9th FYP. All roads are now in a periodic maintenance cycle. The average cost per km both \nfor  resurfacing  and  routine  maintenance  has  been  increased  to  ensure  better  quality  through \nincreased mechanization. \n \n17. \nThe efficiency of the use of the maintenance budget has also improved. The productivity \nof the large national workforce for routine maintenance has been improved during the 9th FYP \nfrom  1  km  per  person  to  1.5  km  per  person  through  scheduled  retirements,  a  freeze  on  new \nrecruitment,  and increasing mechanization.  A recent  DoR initiative includes  the introduction  of \nperformance-based contracts in routine maintenance for a batch of road sections to a group of \nroad workers. The DoR continues to improve the road asset management systems for optimal \nallocation of the  budget.  The construction industry\u2019s experience with mechanized roadworks is \nincreasing  as  the  volume  of  works  increases.  These  actions  demonstrate  the  Government\u2019s \nincreased commitment to maintenance and the increased efficiency of road maintenance works. \n \n18. \nTaking  into  account  the  past  budgetary  provision  and  the  trend,  the  Government  is \nassessed as being able to adequately provide maintenance financing in a sustainable manner. \nIncreased  maintenance  quality  and  productivity  due  to  increased  mechanization,  quality \nassurance  systems,  the  recent  introduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  routine \nmaintenance,  and  more  adoption  of  EFRC  techniques  and  appropriate  road  technologies,  will \nalso  increase  the  efficiency  of  maintenance  works  and  hence  reduce  maintenance  costs.  The \nGovernment  has  given  assurances  that  it  will  provide  adequate  financing  to  maintain  roads \ndeveloped under Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \n\nc. \n\nConstruction Quality \n\n \n19. \nConstruction quality is a critical element for sustainable operation and management, and \nachieving it requires strengthening the capacity of both the Government and the private sector \nin  quality  assurance  and  control.  The  Government  mandates  the  DoR  to  review  design  for  all \nroads, including farm roads, which will enhance the quality of roads at all levels. Considerations \nwould  also  require  the  use  of  appropriate  design  and  technology  for  building  roads  in  the \ncontext of Bhutan, including traffic, weather, and soil conditions. Simple, low-cost methods are \noften more appropriate and effective in terms of construction speed, quality, and environmental \nconsideration,  e.g.,  use  of  natural  gravel,  etc.  The  proposed  Project  will  consider  design  and \ntechnology for simple, low-cost methods as appropriate. \n \nThe  Standards  and  Quality  Control  Authority  (SQCA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Works  and \n20. \nHuman Settlement is responsible for improving quality assurance. A technical specification was \nrenewed  and  published  in  February  2005,  incorporating  environmental  considerations.  All \nconstruction materials require certification by SQCA for use. The proposed attached TA project \n\n\fwill  provide  training  in  road  technologies,  which  will  help  improve  quality  during  the  survey, \ndesign, and construction phases. \n \n\nd. \n\nConstruction Industry \n\n \n21.  With  limited  works  in  the  past,  the  local  construction  industry  has  little  capacity. \nHowever,  local  contractors  have  gained  experience  since  the  8th  FYP,  and  there  has  been \nfurther  promotion  of  private  sector  participation under  the  9th FYP. The  amount  of  contracting \nout  to  the  private  sector  has  increased  from  Nu70  million  under  the  7th  FYP  (1992\u20131997)  to \nNu1,027  million  under  the  8th  FYP  (1997\u20132002)  and  Nu3,806  million  under  the  9th  FYP.  The \ncontract  awards  under  ADB's  Road  Improvement  Project1 (Nu500  million)  and  Road  Network \nProject2 (Nu1,232 million) greatly contributed to this increase. \n \n22. \nThe Construction Development Board (CDB) has a computerized registration system for \ncontractors and an interim mechanism for dispute resolution. The CDB will continue with these \nconstruction  development  services,  research  and  technology  development,  and  awareness  of \nbest  practices.  Training  provided  under  the  attached  TA  project  could  be  open  to  private \ncontractors. \n \n23. \nUnder the 10th FYP, the DoR will coordinate all roadwork contracts to be outsourced to \nthe  private  sector.  Regional  and  internationally  accredited  engineering  and  construction  firms \nwill  also  be  encouraged  to  participate,  in  joint  ventures  with  national  construction  firms  where \nnecessary,  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  project  delivery.  Under  the  Project, \ninternational competitive bidding will be adopted. \n \n\ne. \n\nVehicle Pollution Control \n\n \n24. \nTo minimize pollution, the Government made a pollution control certificate for all vehicles \ncompulsory,  and  so  all  vehicles  are  required  to  have  pollution  checks.  The  RSTA  encourages \nthe establishment of private  sector pollution check centers, and there are two  such centers  so \nfar\u2014in  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing.  The  Government  has  continued  to  establish  permanent \npollution  check  centers,  but  needs  to  establish  more  in  major  cities  that  are  equipped  with \nemission test machines.  \n \n\nf. \n\nOverloading \n\n \n25. \nOverloading  is  an  emerging  problem  in  Bhutan  as  the  size  of  vehicles  increases.  It  is \nalso  expected  that  overloaded  trucks  will  operate  on  the  major  national  highways  as  the \neconomy  grows.  An  overloading  control  program  is  being  set  up  with  initial  installation  of \nweighbridges at major border points such as Gelephu, Jongkhar, Phuentsholing, Samdrup and \nSamtse. Mobile weighbridges are available and more weighbridges will be installed in industrial \ntowns. An overloading penalty of Nu500 per ton is strictly enforced.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\ng. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n26. \nBhutan  has  a  lower  accident  rate  compared  with  other  lower  and  middle-income \ncountries.  However,  the  extent  of  underreporting  of  accidents,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  not \nknown.  Considering  the  high  growth  of  the  vehicle  fleet,  these  positive  statistics  may  not  be \nsustained. \n \n27. \nThe Road Safety and Transport Regulation of 1999 provides regulations for registration \nand  licensing,  commercial  passenger  vehicles,  traffic  control,  and  enforcement  mechanisms. \nMeasures have been taken to educate all drivers on basic safety precautions and many driving \nrefresher  courses  have  been  organized.  Vehicle  inspections  have  been  conducted,  including \npredeparture inspection for buses and inspection of all vehicles every year, except commercial \nvehicles for  which inspection  is  conducted  every  half  year.  Awareness  of  the  need to improve \nroad  safety  is  increasing.  High-risk  accident  areas  are  identified  and  reported  to  the  DoR  for \nfuture improvement. Road safety audits are undertaken under the Project. \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance and ADB Strategy \n\n \n\n \nThe  development  of  the  road  network  has  depended  upon  external  assistance \n28. \n(Appendix  3). The main development  agencies  and  governments  active in  the road sector  are \nADB and the governments of Austria, India, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. \n \nThe  World  Bank  has  the  ongoing  Rural  Access  Project  II,  which  has  included \n29. \nconsiderable institutional support to the DoR. Some support is also provided for the farm road \nprogram through agricultural development projects from various sources such as the European \nUnion, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, the Government of India, International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development, JICA, and Swiss Development Cooperation. \n \n30. \nADB  continues  to  have  dialogue  with  major  financing  agencies  in  the  sector.  ADB \nassistance has focused on resurfacing the East\u2013West Highway in the north and, since the First \nRoad  Network  Project  (RNP-I),  on  network  expansion.  JICA  focuses  on  bridges  and \nconstruction equipment and is now also considering support to roads; the World Bank focuses \non  rural  roads.  For  TA  in  the  sector,  bilateral  funding  agencies  provide  capacity  building  for \nengineering  aspects,  while  ADB  focuses  on  planning  and  policy  aspects,  and  on-the-job \ntechnical support. \n \n31. \nADB involvement in transport and communications has so far been exclusively in roads. \nSince  1983,  within  the  sector  ADB  has  provided  four  loans  totaling  about  $52  million,  seven \nadvisory  TA  projects  totaling  $3.66  million,  and  six  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) projects totaling $2.28 million. ADB  assistance in the sector focuses on improving and \nexpanding  the  road  network  to  provide  better  access  to  regional  and  domestic  markets  with \nsupport to capacity development. The  assistance will continue to provide a number of benefits \nthrough the following strategic sector objectives as per the country strategy and program (2006\u2013\n2010):3 (i) continue to enhance the main road network, (ii) ensure adequate maintenance of the \nexisting  road  network  is  carried  out,  (iii)  improve  rural  accessibility,  (iv)  support  institutional \nstrengthening,  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation,  (vi)  improve  road  technology  and \nproductivity,  and  (vii)  support  subregional  links.

With  the  ongoing  RNP-I,  delay  in \nimplementation  was  caused  mainly  by  a  delay  in  recruitment  of  consultants  and  in  the  land \nacquisition process. The progress of construction is generally acceptable. \n \n33. \nThe  main  weaknesses  in  project  execution  relate  to  design  finalization,  procurement, \nand land acquisition. The DoR has increased the number of engineers, especially in survey and \ndesign areas, and there is a need for further increases in terms of the number of engineers and \nlevels  of  skills  and  knowledge.  For  safeguard  implementation,  the  DoR  has  strengthened  its \ncapacity to satisfy interministerial procedures, such as environmental clearance, and increased \nits familiarity with ADB procurement procedures. During the regional workshop, representatives \nfrom  dzongkhags  with  project  roads  were  invited  for  discussions  to  expedite  land  acquisition \nprocesses.  For  procurement,  the  DoR  has  been  exposed  to  ADB  procurement  procedures \nthrough several ADB projects. Private  sector contractors have also gained experience through \nmore works of a larger size. The DoR has taken initiatives to improve the speed and quality of \ncompletion of construction works, including regular monitoring of project progress. \n \n34. \nUnder  the  Project,  the  DoR  will  outsource  design  works  to  international  engineering \nconsultants,  who  will  provide  procurement  support  including  finalizing  bidding  documents.  On \nsafeguard  aspects,  while  dzongkhags  are  competent  authorities  for  land  acquisition,  the  DoR \nhas offered support such as surveys. The social and resettlement specialist, who will be part of \nthe  team  of  the  design  and  supervision  consultants,  will  also  provide  training  to  the  DoR  and \ndzongkhag officers to familiarize them with ADB policies and requirements, thus improving the \nGovernment's capacity in safeguard implementation. The attached TA project will enhance the \nDoR's capacity in the planning and engineering of roads using modern technologies.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  promote  industrial  development  in  the  southern  areas  of  the  country, \nwhich is remote and has high poverty incidence but high agricultural and industrial development \npotential.  The  Project  will  integrate  the  southern  areas  more  effectively  with  their  primary \nmarkets, increasing regional trade, through increased passenger and freight transport within the \ncountry and with India. The Project will open up high-potential  areas  of Bhutan to the regional \ntransport and distribution system, promoting mutual economic growth and poverty reduction to \nBhutan  and  other  South  Asian  countries  through  more  economic  opportunities  with  India  and \naccess  to  job  opportunities  and  markets.  It  will  also  expand  the  road  transport  network  in  the \nsouthern region, providing a major internal transit route for Bhutanese passengers and goods, \ni.e., an alternative to the existing east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part \nof the country. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nOutputs \n\nB. \n \n36. \nInvestment  Component.  The  Project  will  upgrade  or  construct  five  critical  sections \n(about 180 km) of the southern east\u2013west highway: (i) Manitar\u2013Raidak (37 km, upgrading to a \nnational  highway),  providing  access  to  the  border  crossing  at  Lhamoizingkha;  (ii)  Raidak\u2013\nLhamoizingkha  (25  km,  constructing  a  national  highway);  (iii)  Panbang\u2013Nganglam  (36  km, \nconstructing  a  national  highway),  providing  access  to  the  border  crossing  at  Nganglam;  (iv) \nTsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Durung  Ri  (62  km,  constructing  a  feeder  road);  and  (v)  Samdrupcholing\u2013\nSamrang  (23 km,  constructing  a  national  highway),  providing  access to the  border  crossing  at \nSamdrup Jongkhar. Consulting services will be provided to prepare detailed design and support \nimplementation of the civil works. Road improvement and construction works under the Project \ninclude constructing roadways including longitudinal drainage structures, installing culverts and \nbridges, constructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures, and structures for resettlement \nand rehabilitation of project affected people (Appendix 4). \n \n37. \nCapacity  Building  Component. The Project will also provide equipment necessary for \nthe  Government  to  enhance  sector  capacity  such  as  quality  control,  survey  and  design,  and \ncontrol  of  overloading  and  vehicle  emissions. Major  equipment includes laboratory  equipment, \nsurvey and design equipment and software, vehicle emission and fitness testing equipment, and \nweighbridges.  TA  will  be  attached  to  the  grant  to  support  DoR  capacity  building,  including \nincreased  knowledge  of  and  skills  in  road  technologies  for  survey,  design,  and  construction, \nespecially on EFRC methods. Support to road asset management will be continued for systems \nupdate  and  enhancement.  The  consultants  will  identify  the  specifications  and  timing  of \nequipment  required  during  the  TA  implementation.  Consulting  services  under  detailed  design \nand  construction  supervision  will  provide  on-the-job  technical  inputs  and  training  during \nimplementation, especially on EFRC. \n \nC. \n \n38. \nEnvironmental  Considerations  and  Appropriate  Technologies  in  Design  and \nConstruction. The DoR has adopted EFRC techniques in its design standard and construction. \nThe methodology adopted for environmental consideration will minimize damage to the natural \nenvironment  by  use  of  controlled  blasting,  limited  use  of  bulldozers  (excavator-tipper \ncombinations are used instead), use of log and boulder barriers to control slipping of blasted or \nexcavated  materials,  and  incorporation  of  bioengineering  techniques  for  slope  protection.  The \nlatest  road  technical  specifications  for  roads  and  bridges  published  in  February  2005  adopt \nthese  methods.  Also,  simple,  low-cost  methods  are  appropriately  adopted  for  improving \nconstruction speed, quality, and environmental consideration, e.g., the use of natural gravel, etc. \nThe Project will adopt these methods for all road sections. \n \n39. \nCommunity  Participation  in  Alignment  Selection.  During  project  preparation,  field \nstudies  were  conducted  by  using  household  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  village  profile \nsurveys,  consultations  with  other  stakeholders  both  on-site  and  at  headquarters  in  Thimphu, \nand  workshops  at  which  findings  were  discussed  and  roads  and  preliminary  alignments  were \ndetermined. The proposed alignment was decided through public consultation with communities \nand  consideration  of  the  assessment  of  economics  and  technical,  social,  and  environmental \naspects.  Any  changes  to  the  alignment  will  be  minimal  at  the  time  of  detailed  engineering \nstudies due to full consultation with communities. \n \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n\fProject Investment Plan \n\nD. \n \n40. \n(Table 1).

Provision of an alternative east\u2013\nwest  road  in  the  south  will  substantially  increase  traffic  and  hence  business  opportunities, \nespecially  traffic  between  northeastern  states  of  India  and  Thimphu  and  north  of  Thimphu, \nunder  the  Project.  The  additional  ADF  liquidity  of  $8.76  million  was  provided  to  Bhutan  under \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nthe crisis response of ADF, all of which has been allocated for the Project by the Government. \nThis  will  support  the  Government's  continued  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction \nefforts and prevent any adverse impact on the economy, especially the tourism industry, in the \nwake of the global financial and economic slowdown. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n43. \nThe  organization  chart  for  project  implementation  is  provided  in  Appendix  6.  The  DoR \nwill  be  the  executing  agency.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  established  and \nheaded  by  a  full  time  project  coordinator  at  the  executive  engineer  level.  The  PMO  will  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  the  overall  coordination,  management  and  monitoring  of  the  Project,  (ii) \nsupervision of the detailed engineering design and (iii) procurement. The DoR may, as required, \norganize  meetings  of  related  agencies  of  the  Government  to  facilitate  swift  resolution  of  any \nimplementation-related issues requiring coordination amongst various departments.  \n  \n44. \nIn  addition  to  the  PMO,  two  site  offices  will  be  established  to  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring day-to-day implementation of the Project and preparation of project progress reports, \neach to be headed by a project manager at the assistant engineer level. \n \n45. \nProcurement  and  contract  awards  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  PMO.  Each  regional \noffice  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  monitoring  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project  implementation, \nand (ii) preparing project progress reports. The project coordinator will consolidate these reports \nand  submit  them  to  the  DoR  and  ADB,  and  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  withdrawal \napplications. The project coordinator and all project managers will meet on a quarterly basis or \nas required. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years inclusive of preconstruction activities, and \n46. \ntaking  into  account  the  time  required  for  preparing  detailed  design,  bidding  documents,  and \nprocurement. Civil works are expected to commence around January 2011 and be completed in \nDecember 2014. The implementation schedule is included in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n47. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts \nwill  be  undertaken  in  10  contract  packages  (Appendix  8).  All  these  contracts  are  estimated  at \nmore than $1 million and will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures \nwith  domestic  margin  of  preference.  ADB  is  currently  updating  the  list  of  countries  eligible  for \ndomestic preference, which will be issued shortly. If Bhutan is not on the updated list of eligible \ncountries at the time of bidding, the domestic preference referred to elsewhere in this report will \nnot  be  applicable  to  this  Project.  The  civil  works  contracts  have  been  packaged  to  encourage \nboth  international  and  national  bidders  to  participate  for  development  of  the  domestic \nconstruction  industry.  The  indicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  8.  Bidders  will  be \npostqualified  by  applying  a  single-stage,  two-envelope  bidding  procedure.  Award  of  contracts \nwill require prior review and approval by ADB. \n \n\n\f48. \nEquipment financed under the Project will be worth $1 million under the capacity building \ncomponent,  and  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  the \nestimated contract is more than $500,000, using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nif  the  estimated  contract  is  between  $100,000  and  $500,000,  and  shopping  if  the  estimated \ncontract  amount  is  less  than  $100,000.  Contract  packaging  for  equipment  will  be  based  on \nrequired technical features and timing  of procurement. The TA consultants engaged  under the \nattached  TA  will  identify  the  packages  during  TA  implementation.  The  procurement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n49. \nThe  NCB  annex  summarizes  necessary  modifications  to  or  clarification  of  Bhutan\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  carry  out  NCB  for  ADB-financed  projects.  NCB  will  be  used  for \ncontracts with an estimated value of less than $1 million and in cases where it is deemed more \nexpeditious than international competitive bidding. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n50. \nTwo  international  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  for  (i)  detailed  design  and \nprocurement  assistance,  and  (ii)  construction  supervision  of civil  works under  the Project. The \nDoR will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n51. \nFor  preparing  detailed  design  and  bidding  documents  and  helping  the  DoR  with \nprocurement, an international consulting firm, in association with a national firm and/or individual \nconsultants,  will  be  recruited.  The  consulting  inputs  of  the  consultants  will  be  34  international \nperson-months  and  32  national  person-months.  The  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  have  been \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix C). The DoR has proposed to select the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultant  as  the  detailed  design  and  procurement  assistance \nconsultant  through  single  source  selection,  which  is  a  justifiable  request  because  the  PPTA \nconsultants  (i)  have  a  clear  advantage  due  to  the  highly  unique  topographic  and  geotechnical \nconditions  of  project  roads,  thereby  limiting  competition;  (ii)  do  not  require  preparatory  work, \nthereby  saving  costs;  (iii)  have  demonstrated  qualifications  and  experience  through  strong \nperformance  during  the  PPTA;  and  (iv)  did  not  prepare  the  TOR  for  the  subsequent  project \npackage  on  design  and  procurement  assistance,  thereby  confirming  absence  of  conflict  of \ninterest  (refer  to  Attachment  1  of  Appendix  9).  If  selected,  key  personnel  of  the  PPTA  team, \nincluding  the  team  leader,  the  deputy  team  leader,  and  the  current  national  specialists  on \nenvironment  and  resettlement/social  issues,  will  be  retained  for  design  and  procurement \nassistance. \n \nFor construction supervision, an international consulting firm in association with national \n52. \nconsultants  and/or  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited.  The  TOR  have  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix D). An estimated 28 person-months of international and 604 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  inputs  will  be  provided.  The  international  consultants  will  also \nprovide  on-the-job  training  to  counterpart  staff  and  national  consultants,  especially  on  EFRC \nimplementation.  The  consultant  will  be  recruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod (with full technical proposal). \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n53. \nADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  and  provided  in-principle  agreement \nfor  retroactive  financing  in  July  2009.  Up  to  20%  of  the  grant  proceeds  will  be  eligible  for \nretroactive  financing,  provided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nconsulting  services  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures  and  during  the  12 \nmonths  before  the  signing  of  the  grant  agreement.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  in-principle  approval  of  retroactive  financing  does  not  in \nany way commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n54. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  DoR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions  of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy  are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  DoR  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n55. \nThe  contracting  regime  is  transparent,  and  open  tendering  is  conducted in  accordance \nwith  the  Financial  Manual  (1988) 6 ,  which  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance.  This  was \nenhanced  through  a  series  of  modifications  as  the  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  20097 \nalong with standardization of bidding documents of works and goods, and request for proposal \nfor  recruiting  consulting  services.  The  Royal  Audit  Authority  undertakes  a  periodic  audit  of \naccounts  and  statements  as  part  of  its  mandate  on  performance  audits  of  government \nministries. The Public Finance Act was enacted in 2007 to regulate the financial management of \nthe  Government  in  order  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  public  resources, \nstrengthen accountability, and provide statutory authority and control for sound and sustainable \nfiscal  policy.  In  respect  of  anticorruption  measures,  the  Royal  Audit  Authority  undertakes  a \nprogram  of  workshops  to  (i)  increase  awareness  of  public  officials  and  the  general  public  of \nissues surrounding corruption, and (ii) promote discussions on current policies and guidelines. \n \nThe  Project  is  the  second  project  of  a  similar  nature.  The  financial  management \n56. \narrangements for the project will remain the same as they were for the RNP-I. The Government \nis  familiar  with  managing  external  funds,  as  well  as  utilizing,  accounting,  and  reporting  for  the \nsame. \n \n57. \nThe DoR will disclose information on the progress of the project to the public by making \ntimely  updates  on  its  website.  The  DoR  has  separated  its  mechanical  division  into  a  separate \ncorporate  entity  (CDC),  which  will  help  increase  competition  among  contractors,  and  hence \nincrease  quality  and  reduce  cost.  To  enhance  overall  road  sector  management,  part  of  the \nattached TA project will provide capacity strengthening of the DoR in asset management, which \nwill  improve  governance  of  road  administration  and  accountability.  For  the  Project,  ADB \nprocurement procedures using international competitive bidding will enhance transparency and \nfair  competition,  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  FIDIC8-based  contract  management \nwill mitigate corruption problems during implementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Royal Government of Bhutan. 1998.

Thimphu. \n8 Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n \n\n\f7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n58. \nGrant  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment,  reimbursement,  and  imprest  account \nprocedures will be used for civil works, consulting services, and equipment. An imprest account \nfor  RNP-II  will  be  established  at  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority,  and  the  initial  and  maximum \namount to be deposited in the imprest account shall not exceed 10% of the grant amount or the \nequivalent  of  6  months  estimated  expenditure  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account, \nwhichever is lower. The DoR will be responsible for monitoring this account, including monthly \nreconciliation  of \nfor \nliquidation/replenishment  of  the  account.  To  expedite  disbursement  during  implementation, \nstatement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  will  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish  the  imprest \naccount  for  any  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000,  which  may  be \nreviewed  and  increased  to  $100,000  based  on  experience  of  the  new  project  team  and  its \ncapacity  to  manage  SOE.  The  project  coordinator  will  ensure  timely  processing  of  payment \nrequests  from  the  contractors  and  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  processes  and  forwards  each \npayment request within 5 days of receipt of such requests to the Ministry of Finance for release \nof funds.  \n \n\nthe  accounts  and  preparation  of \n\nthe  withdrawal  applications \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n59. \nThe  DOR  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods \nand  services financed from  the  grant  proceeds, the  expenditure incurred,  and the  use  of local \nfunds  under  the  Project.  The  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples.  These  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in \naccordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit \nreport will include the audit of the SOE procedures, and will specifically include a separate audit \nopinion  on  the  use  of  grant  proceeds  and  compliance  with  SOE  procedures.  The  imprest \naccount and SOE will be audited as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the \nexamination of the imprest account and SOE will be separate in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n60. \nThe  audited  reports  and  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  9 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  taking  into  account  the  geographical  and  logistical \ndifficulties in completing the auditing within 6 months. The request from the Government for a 9-\nmonth period for completing and submitting reports of audits carried out on the project activities \ncan  be  considered  justified  considering  that  Project  roads  are  scattered  from  the  west  to  the \neast with difficult access, and contracts will be managed by the PMO and two site offices which \nare also scattered to facilitate close management of project roads. This will mean that the PMO \nwill require more time for checking submissions by site offices. Under the ongoing project (RNP-\nI), the time allowed for submission of audited project accounts to ADB is 9 months following the \nend  of  the  fiscal  year  based  on  weak  capacity  of  the  country's  auditing  systems.  Of  the  two \nactual submissions so far, one was delayed by 2.6 months beyond the 9 months and the other \nwas submitted 1.5 months in advance, which is still 7.5 months from the end of the fiscal year. \n \n61. \nThe  DoR  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  Project  quarterly  progress  reports  on \nprogress  made  during  the  period  of  review,  changes  if  any  to  the  implementation  schedule, \nproblems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  remedial  actions taken,  anticipated  problems  and the \nproposed remedial measures, and work to be undertaken in the following period. The DoR will \nsubmit  the  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  within  45  days  from  the  close  of  each  quarter. \nThese reports will also include a summary financial account for each subproject, expenditure to \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\ndate,  report  on  performance  monitoring,  and  the  results  of  monitoring  of  the  social  and \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n62. \nThe DoR will prepare and provide ADB with a road completion report within 3 months of \nphysical completion of each individual road, and a Project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion  of  transactions  under  the  Project.  These  reports  will  cover  a  detailed  evaluation  of \neach  road  project  and  the  overall  project  covering  the  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and \nconsultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  economic  rate  of  return,  and  other \ndetails relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n63. \nThe  DoR  will,  within  3  months  of  the  grant  signing,  develop  a  systematic  project \nperformance monitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, for use throughout \nthe life of the Project. \n \n64. \nThe DoR will establish, within 3 months of the effective date of the grant, a baseline for \nperformance  indicators  to  be  used  for  monitoring  implementation  of  each  road  project.  It  will \nthereafter conduct evaluation surveys annually under each road project, in accordance with the \nproject  performance  monitoring  system,  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nprogress, and achievements of objectives of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n65. \nADB and DoR will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures required to be undertaken \ntowards  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  subprojects  and  the  Project.  A  midterm  review  of  the \nProject will be  undertaken by ADB and DoR in 2012. The midterm  review  will focus  on issues \nrelated  to  implementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the \nobjective of the Project. \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n66. \nThe TA of $400,000 for Capacity Building of the Department of Roads will cover part of \nthe  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to  strengthen  DoR  capacity  in  road  technologies  and  road  asset \nmanagement  to  ensure  the  quality  of  road  construction.  The  focus  of  the  TA  will  be  to  equip \nDoR  officials  with  knowledge  of  and  skills  in  the  road  technologies  of  survey,  design,  and \nconstruction, especially with environmental considerations. Support to road asset management \nwill  be  continued  with  focus  on  guiding  DoR  officials  in  the  optimal  use  of  the  road  asset \nmanagement systems and application of computerized systems in applicable roads. \n \n67. \nThe  consultants  will  undertake  the  services  in  close  consultation  with  the  director \ngeneral of the DoR. Other agencies such as SQCA, CDC, CDB, and Construction Association \nof  Bhutan  will  also  participate  in  training  and  workshops.  The  consultants  will  also  conduct \ntraining and workshops in the field and nationally as required. \n \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB's  TA  funding  program  (Technical \n68. \nAssistance  Special  Fund-IV),  and  be  carried  out  by  an  international  consulting  firm,  to  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The TA will be implemented for 6 months from December 2009 to May 2010. \n\n\fInternational inputs of about 13 person-months are required. Terms of reference for the TA are \nin Appendix 10. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\nInstitutional and Operational Improvements \n\n \nA. \n \n69. \nVarious  measures  suitable  to  Bhutanese  conditions  are  incorporated  in  the  design, \nespecially  environmental  considerations  in  design  and  construction,  e.g.,  bioengineering  in \nslope  protection,  controlled  blasting,  and  appropriate  technologies.  Overall,  the  Project  will \ndevelop  quality  roads  (thereby  substantially  improving  transport  efficiency),  speed  up  traffic, \nimprove travel conditions, and reduce journey time and vehicle operating costs (VOCs). \n \nB. \n \n70. \nImproving  management  of  the  Bhutan  road  network  through  the  capacity  building \ncomponent and the TA, and the expansion of the road network under the Project, will enhance \noverall road conditions and usability, thus increasing the travel speeds and reducing travel time, \naccidents, overloading, and hence subregional traffic. The enhancement of the DoR\u2019s capacity \nin  construction  quality  and  road  asset  management  will  improve  sustainability  of  roads  and \nefficiency  of  road  maintenance,  leading  to  better  governance  in  road  administration  and \naccountability  creating  an  environment  encouraging  efficiency  within  the  DoR  and  the \nconstruction  industry.  This  will  ensure  that  road  asset  development  and  management  is  more \nefficient, and construction and maintenance is of higher quality, resulting in decreased recurrent \ncosts over the medium and long term. This will add to the overall level of social and economic \ndevelopment in Bhutan. \n \nC. \n \nThe economic assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \n71. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 9 The  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  was  used  to \ncalculate VOCs and time costs with modification for conditions in Bhutan. The principal benefits \nare  VOCs  savings  and  travel  time  savings.  Additional  benefits  to  the  population  in  project-\naffected areas have been added: (i) savings in VOCs and time due to improved passenger and \nfreight transport, (ii) benefits of traffic generated by increased consumption and production due \nto better access, (ii) reduced loss of perishable goods are also added as part of the exogenous \nbenefits  of  the  model,  and  (iv)  VOC  savings  for  the  traffic  diverted  from  other  routes  due  to \nshortened project roads. \n \n72. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the roads evaluated varied between 16% \nand 24%. The Project as a whole and by the individual road is robust. This is mainly due to the \nleast-cost  approach,  such  as  reducing  the  formation  width  and  use  of  gravel  for  those  roads \nhaving limited traffic. \n \n73. \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increase by 20%, (ii) benefits decrease by 20%, (iii) a combination of the first \ntwo  cases,  (iv)  a  construction  delay  of  1  year,  and  (v)  a  50%  reduction  to  the  highest  benefit \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nSocial Impacts \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\ncategory. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity \ntests.  Only  one  road  has  an  EIRR  slightly  below  12%  in  the  worst-case  scenario.  The  roads \nserve  one  of  the  most  undeveloped  areas  of  the  country,  and  their  improvement  will  have  a \npositive  impact  on  the  development  of  these  areas.  Considering  their  positive  development \nimpact and the fact that even in the worst-case scenario, they have an EIRR of more than 10%, \nthe  roads  are  recommended  for  implementation  under  the  Project  along  with  all  other  roads \nincluded in the analysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nD. \n \nIncremental recurrent costs associated with the project are estimated to be 14% of the \n74. \ncurrent  DoR  maintenance  budget  and  2%  of  the  overall  DoR  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  The \nmaintenance  will  be  required  after  project  completion  in  2014  and  the  appropriate  budget \nincrease is expected, considering the trend in past years. It is reasonable to expect that funds \nwill be available to meet these costs. \n \nE. \n \nLivelihood and Poverty Reduction. Remoteness and isolation are the major causes of \n75. \npoverty in Bhutan. The construction of national highways and feeder roads covering 183.0 km \n(Manitar\u2013Raidak,  37.0  km;  Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha,  25.0  km;  Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong,  36.0 \nkm;  Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang,  23.0 km;  and Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Shingchungri,  62.0 km)  will  have \ndirect benefits for the local population (poor and vulnerable groups and households headed by \nwomen).  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  bring  new  economic \nopportunities  to  the  remote  areas  of  the  country.  It  is  also  expected  to  increase  economic \nactivity  (particularly  in  small  retail)  at  the  roadsides  and  increased  accessibility  due  to \nconstruction of access roads connected to the main roads.  \n \n76. \nThe  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  positive  in  terms  of  access  to  health \ncare  facilities  and  education,  improved  communication  facilities,  easy  transportation  of  cash \ncrops,  and  vibrant  growth  of  economic  activities  in  rural  villages.  Rural  electrification  is  also \nexpected to improve once road connectivity is established. This will permit students to study for \nlonger  hours  in the  evening,  and  contribute to  a cleaner living  environment through the  use  of \nelectricity and gas for cooking, thus saving the forests from further degradation. \n \n77. \nThe  income-generation  activities  of  the  population  of  the  immediate  and  wider  project \ninfluence areas are expected to increase through sales of local produce at the road sites almost \non a daily basis. As a result, the Project will significantly reduce the poverty level and improve \nfive  beneficiary  dzongkhags  (districts)\u2014Chhukha,  Dagana, \nthe  quality  of \nPemagatshel,  Samdrupjongkhar  and  Zhemgang\u2014through  connectivity  of  these  remote  rural \nareas. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \nGender.  Gender  participation  was  ensured  during  the  course  of  the  social  study  by \n78. \nundertaking  a  process  of  gender  analysis  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project.  Sixteen  focus \ngroup  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  belonging  to  different  socioeconomic  groups \nsuch  as  high  income,  poor  people,  and  women  belonging  to  different  ethnicities.  These \ndiscussions revealed that the majority of the women felt that the roads will benefit them as they \nwill be able to transport their yield to market and this will help increase their income. The study \nrevealed  no  significant  discrimination  against  women  in  Bhutan.  The  socioeconomic  survey \nshowed  that,  although  some  activities  may  be  predominantly  undertaken  by  either  women  or \nmen,  women  and  men  traditionally  have  equal  status  for  most  socioeconomic  activities.  The \n\nthe \n\nlife \n\nin \n\n\fstudies also revealed that rural women are becoming more visible in both household and other \nactivities, and women are frequently taking on additional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle \nfor their families. Along with men in the project areas, women will benefit from (i) easier access \nto  external markets,  (ii) increased local  retailing  opportunities,  and (iii) easier  access  to  health \ncare  centers  and  education  facilities.  Women  may  also  benefit  more  than  men  from  the \nincreased access to schools. Traditionally, enrolment rates in schools have been lower for girls \nthan for boys. \n\n79. \nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous People. To assess the Project resettlement \nimpacts, a census survey based on preliminary road designs was undertaken from February to \nApril 2009. For the five roads proposed for construction (national  and feeder), 125.89 acres of \nprivate land (107.59 acres of dry land and 18.3 acres of wet land) are going to be affected. All \nthe land to be acquired is privately owned. There are 279 affected households in total for all the \nroads.  Eighty  six  affected  structures  are  mainly  permanent  houses,  temporary  sheds, \ncowsheds, toilets, water tanks, and water taps. There are also mud irrigation channels that are \ncommunity-owned and will require restoration. \n \n80. \nFive separate short resettlement plans have been prepared to mitigate and address all \nthese  and  associated  losses.  These  resettlement  plans  were  developed  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Government  Land  Act  1979  (amended  in  2007). \nComplete details of compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, shifting assistance, \nand  other  income  restoration  assistance  are  provided  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the \nresettlement  plans.  Additional  support  provisions  for  affected  people  belonging  to  vulnerable \ngroups  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plans.  No  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  envisaged. \nThe total cost for resettlement is estimated at $1.23 million (Nu63,965,384). A summary of the \nresettlement plans is in Supplementary Appendix A.   \n\n81. \nAIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The  Government  has  the  15-year  National  Sexually \nTransmitted Disease/AIDS Control Program. This is a multisector initiative involving all sections \nof  society  in  Bhutan  since  1988,  assisted  by  bilateral  development  agencies,  United  Nations \nagencies,  and  a  World  Bank  grant. 10  The  Government  has  been  successfully  carrying  out \nawareness campaigns and free health care to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS in various parts \nof  the  country.  The  social  assessments  undertaken  have  not  revealed  any  significant  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  However,  the  DoR  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors \ndisseminate information at work sites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS for \nthose employed during construction. Contracts for all subprojects will include specific clauses on \nthese  undertakings,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  by  the  DoR,  with  the  support  of \nsupervision consultants during project implementation. \n \nF. \n \n82. \nThe Project has  been classified as category  A under ADB\u2019s Environment  Policy (2002) \nas  some  of  the  road  segments  fall  inside  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Of  the  five  road \nsegments,  the  Panbang\u2013Nganglam  road  falls  inside  the  buffer  zone  of  the  Royal  Manas \nNational  Park  for  most  of  its  36  km  length,  and  approximately  7  km  of  the  Samdrupcholing\u2013\nSamrang  road  falls  inside  the  Khaling  Wildlife  Sanctuary.  In  addition  to  these  two,  road \nsegments  along  the  Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha  road  fall  inside  habitat  of  important  wildlife \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n                                                 \n10  World Bank. 2004.

Washington \nD.C.   \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nspecies\u2014elephant (Elephus maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus). Both these species are listed as \nendangered  and  vulnerable  under  the  IUCN 11  list  and  under  Schedule  I  (totally  protected \nspecies) of the Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995. In addition, the Forest and \nNature  Conservation  Act  requires  the  preparation  of  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  for  projects  that  fall  inside  or  in  the  buffer  zone  of  protected  areas.  An  EIA \nhas  been  prepared  for  this  project  and  the  summary  EIA  (Supplementary  Appendix  B)  was \ncirculated to the Board. \n \n83. \nAnticipated environmental impacts under the Project include impacts on (i) the physical \nenvironment such as air, soil, and water; (ii) the biological environment, such as vegetation and \nwildlife;  and  (iii)  the  socioeconomic  environment,  such  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nlabor  conditions,  and  damage  to  local  infrastructure.  Most  of  the  impacts  are  short  term, \nreversible,  and  confined  to  the  construction  stage  of  the  Project.  Most  of  the  impacts  can  be \nminimized  and  addressed  through  mitigation  measures  that  have  been  included  in  the \nengineering design and the environmental management plan (EMP), which follow the principles \nof environmentally friendly road construction advocated by the Department of Roads. Hence, all \nnecessary mitigation costs have already been included in the engineering works.  \n \nRemoval of approximately 100 hectares (ha) of vegetation including 21,000 trees with a \n84. \ndiameter  breast  height  (dbh)  that  is  greater  than  0.9  meter  are  potential  permanent  and \nirreversible  impacts.  However,  necessary  measures  will  be  implemented  to  revegetate  the \nnewly cut slopes and areas and a compensatory tree plantation program along with a lump-sum \nbudget amount have been included in the EMP to recover the lost trees. Disturbance to wildlife \nhabitat  and  obstruction of  the  wildlife movement  paths,  particularly  of  elephant  and  gaur, from \nthe  Indian  plains  in  the  south  into  the  foothills  of  Bhutan  in  the  north  are  the  most  significant \nimpacts  anticipated  from  the  Project.  Discussions  have  been  carried  out  with  the  Nature \nConservation Division of the Department of Forests, and the department has agreed to provide \ntechnical support for ensuring the development of road design and structures that will allow the \ncontinuation of the wildlife movement. \n \nBoth  the  EMP  and  engineering  costs  will  be  further  updated  after  the  detailed  design \n85. \nstudies  have  been  carried  out.  An  environment  specialist  will  be  engaged  to  ensure  that  all \nproposed measures are taken to minimize or mitigate negative impacts during the preparation of \nthe detailed design. Significant changes in the EIA and EMP due to significant changes in the \nProject will warrant resubmission of the EIA report to government agencies of Bhutan and ADB \nfor approval. \n \nG. \n \n86. \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation  will  be  mitigated  through  (i)  the  DoR\u2019s  advance \nactions  and ADB's  prior review  of  procurement, (ii) more  hands-on  advice  during  procurement \nprocesses,  and  (iii)  more  awareness  of  ADB  safeguard  requirements  by  the  DoR  and \ndzongkhag  officials.  ADB  prior  review  will  facilitate  the  approval  process  of  bid  evaluation. \nHands-on  support  will  be  provided  by  the  consultant  under  the  Project.  Training  in  safeguard \nrequirements  will  be  provided  to  the  DoR  and  dzongkhag  officials  by  environment  and \nresettlement  specialists  under  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  to  mitigate \ndelays  due  to  procedural  clearance.  The  DoR  will  provide  required  support  to  dzongkhag \noffices, such as survey teams to facilitate land acquisition.  \n \n\nProject Risks \n\n                                                 \n11  International Union for Conservation of Nature \n\n\fThe country assistance program evaluation for Bhutan12 indicated a risk of ad hoc design \n87. \nchanges, which could result in realignment, leading to implementation delay. This risk has been \nminimized  with  full  consultation  with  local  communities  and  dzongkhag  officials.  Technical \nadvice  will  be  provided  by  the  consultant  under  the  attached  TA  and  design  and  supervision \nconsultants  on  appropriate  technologies  with  environment  considerations,  which  will  ensure \ntimely implementation of high-quality projects. \n \n88. \nThe  risk  of  inadequate  maintenance  financing  is  mitigated  through  TA  for  continued \nsupport  to  asset management  planning. Sufficient  budget  was  allocated  to  the  targeted  length \nunder the 9th FYP and the Government has provided for increased cost per km and increased \ntarget length under the 10th FYP. \n \n89. \nAs the country program evaluation and project performance audit report suggest, the TA \nis designed to reflect local conditions, develop simpler practical systems, and make consultants \ninput  more  DoR-oriented,  by  providing  DoR  staff  with  specific  tasks  to  be  completed  with \nminimal inputs given by international consultants for overall guidance. \n \n90. \nFiduciary  risks  are  addressed  by  adopting  international  best  practices  in  procurement \nwith ADB prior review. This is a repeat project. The Ministry of Finance and the DoR have been \nexposed  to  ADB  requirements  and  are  fully  aware  of  procedures.  A  discrepancy  was  recently \nidentified in  the computation method under the  ongoing RNP-I. The issue has been discussed \nand resolved, and hence no more issues are envisaged. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nCounterpart  Funds. The Government will ensure the timely and adequate provision of \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  DoR  have  given  the \n\n \nA. \n \n91. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nRoad  Maintenance  Financing.  The  Government  will  provide  sufficient  and  timely \n92. \nbudget  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the  entire  road  network  every  year  throughout \nproject implementation. \n  \n93. \nall counterpart funds for the Project. \n \n94. \nRoad Safety. The Government will ensure that road safety measures are implemented, \ntaking  into  account  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  PPTA  and  design  and  supervision \nconsultants. \n \n95. \nOverloading. The Government will ensure that all prevailing regulations on overloading \ncontrol,  including  penalties,  will  be  effectively  implemented,  including  by  further  installing \noverweigh bridges. \n \n96. \nHealth.  The  Government  and  the  DoR  will  ensure  that  contractors  provide  adequately \nfor health and safety. Bidding documents will include measures on how contractors will address \nthis,  including  an  information  and  awareness  raising  campaign  for  construction  workers  on \nsexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005.

The Government and the DoR will ensure that civil works contractors comply with \nall  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and \nmaintenance activities, and provide appropriate facilities for women and children in construction \ncampsites.  People  directly  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  given  priority  to  be  employed  by  the \nProject.  Contractors  will  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal \nvalue.  A  specific  clause  ensuring  this  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents.  The  DoR  will \ncooperate with the Department of Labor to monitor the implementation of this clause. \n \n98. \nEnvironmental Consideration. The Government will implement all mitigation measures \nincluded in the EIA reports in accordance with the Royal Bhutan Environmental Policy as well as \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy. The DoR will consult on a continuing basis with the park managers \nof the nearby national parks on the locations for construction campsites, hot mix and crushing \nplants, and disposal and handling of spoiled materials. The DoR will incorporate the EIA reports \nincluding  the  EMP  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts,  and  are  updated,  if \nnecessary,  in  the  course  of  Project  implementation  with  prior  approval  of  ADB  ensure  that \ncontractors  will  implement  the  required  mitigation  measures  and  EMP  as  described  in  these \nreports.  The  DoR  shall  ensure  that  all  conditions  attached  to  these  clearances  will  be \nimplemented and monitored. The DoR will promptly mitigate and minimize any adverse impact \non the environment that may arise from the Project implementation in accordance with the EMP. \nThe  DoR  will  undertake  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  and  submit  semiannual  reports  to \nADB and agencies on the implementation of the EMP as part of the progress report on Project \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  report  to  ADB  any  change  in  alignment  or  to  project \ncomponents since the environmental assessment report was approved to allow a consideration \non whether additional environmental assessment study is required. \n \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The Government will (i) implement the Project in \n99. \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plans  prepared,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples (2006) and applicable national laws and regulations; (ii) in \ncase of any design changes in project roads, ensure that the resettlement plans are updated on \nthe basis of the final alignment and submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to awarding \nof civil works contracts; and (iii) provide semiannual progress reports on the implementation of \nthe resettlement plans. \n\n \n \nConditions for Award of Contracts \n\nB. \n \n100.  The  Government  will  not  award  civil  works  contract  unless  the  following  requirements \nhave been met:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDuring  the  detailed  design  phase  of  the  Project,  the  DoR  will  update  the \nresettlement  plans  and  the  EMP  as  required.  If  the  scope  of  the  Project  is \nsubstantially  changed,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  revised  accordingly  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  award  of  any  civil  works  contract.  Any \nchanges  to  the  EMP  will  be  reviewed,  recorded,  and  submitted  to  the  National \nEnvironment  Commission  as  well  as  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence  as \nrequired prior to awarding of civil works contracts.  \nThe  DoR  will  have  obtained  the  environmental  clearance  from  the  National \nEnvironment Commission for the purposes of the contract. \n\n \n\n\fConditions for Commencement of Civil Works \n\nC. \n \n101.  The DoR  will  not  commence  civil  works  unless it  has  acquired,  paid compensation  for, \nand made  available  the land  and  rights in  land free from  any  encumbrances,  and  cleared  any \nobstruction  from  the  related  section  required  to  be  handed  over  to  the  contractor  for \ncommencement  of  construction  in  accordance  with  the  work  schedule  under  the  related  civil \nworks contract. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n102. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  grant  not  exceeding  $38,760,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources for the Road Network Project II, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nC.

Road transport is the only internal transport mode in Bhutan, other than a few ropeways. \nThe country has no domestic flights, no railways, and no navigable rivers. However, many areas \nare  not accessible by road and are served only  by an  extensive network of mule tracks which \nexists throughout the country. The census survey in 2005 indicates that 9.7% of the population \nlives more than 6 hours away from the nearest road and that the rural households in six districts \ncomprise 73% of this percentage. Only one airport provides limited air access to the rest of the \nworld. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement in transport and communications so far \nhas been only in the road sector. \n \nThe  Government's  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP,  2008\u20132013)  objectives  for  roads  and \n2. \nbridges are (i) providing road access to all gewog (town) centers; (ii) reducing poverty incidence \nand improving the quality of life of the rural population through enhanced rural accessibility; (iii) \nenhancing  national  security  and  solidarity  through  an  improved/expanded  road  network;  (iv) \nenhancing road connectivity to facilitate accelerated hydropower development; (v) consolidating \nenvironmentally  friendly  construction  practices  to  minimize  impacts  on  the  environment;  (vi) \nenhancing reliability, economy, safety, ease, and comfort of road travel through reducing travel \ntime,  road  user  costs,  transportation  costs  of  goods  and  services,  and  traffic  accidents;  (vii) \nin  delivery  of  construction  and \npromoting  and  enhancing  private  sector  participation \nmaintenance  of  road  and  bridge  infrastructure;  and  (viii)  building  professionalism  and \nengineering  capacity  in  the  areas  of  planning,  design,  monitoring,  quality  control,  and  cost-\neffective  construction  of  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  works.  The  overall  budget  of  the \nDepartment  of  Roads  (DoR)  under  the  10th  FYP  is  Nu13,708  million  for  (i)  road  construction, \nincluding feeder roads (Nu6,438 million); (ii) road improvement, including realignment (Nu4,569 \nmillion);  (iii)  road  resurfacing  (Nu1,389  million);  (iv)  routine  maintenance  (Nu784  million);  (v) \nmonsoon restoration (Nu200 million); and (vi) bridges and other activities. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  a  landlocked  country  such  as  Bhutan,  socioeconomic  development  depends  largely \non  an  efficient  and  reliable  road  network.  Since  the  construction  of  the  179  kilometer  (km) \nPhuentsholing\u2013Thimphu  Highway  in  1959,  the  national  road  network  has  expanded  to  about \n4,947 km of motorable roads, including 1,632 km of national highways, 489 km of district roads, \n813  km  of  feeder  roads,  150  km  of  urban  roads,  717  km  of  farm  roads,  and  560  km  of  forest \nroads. This  gives  a  road  density  of  0.13 km  per square km  and  7.5 km per  1,000  inhabitants. \nThe km per inhabitants figure is relatively high in comparison with countries of similar size and \nincome  level;  this  is  due  to  Bhutan\u2019s  low  population  density.  Travel  between  east  and  west \nregions relies on the single east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the \ncountry, or it requires going through in India, especially in southern areas of the country. Other \nthan  the  traditional  surface  border  crossings  with  India,  only  one  airport  provides  limited  air \naccess to the rest of the world. \n \nAlmost all national highways (95%), more than 90% of the district and urban roads, and \n4. \nabout 20% of feeder roads are paved. Narrow roads have been built along steep hillsides prone \nto  landslides.  Roads  become  difficult  to  use  during  the  winter  months  and  rainy  season. \nImprovement,  maintenance,  and  expansion  of  the  existing  road  network  is  urgently  required. \nBecause of the mountainous terrain, the area of land suitable for agriculture is limited, and the \n\nRoad Network and Traffic \n\n\fAppendix 2       25 \n\nBhutan Road Asset Management \n\npopulation  of  less  than  700,000  is  distributed  in  remote  settlements.  This  situation  makes \nconstruction  and  maintenance  of  roads  extremely  difficult  and  costly.  The  widespread  use  of \nmanual resurfacing can only provide low-quality pavement. \n \n5. \nThe  number  of  motor  vehicle  registrations  increased  from  29,914  in  2005  to  35,703  in \n2007, which is an average annual increase of 9.2%. The highest increase was in light vehicles \nat  13%,  and  there  was  not  much  increase  in  two-wheelers.  Out  of  35,703  motor  vehicles \nregistered,  over  60%  were  light  vehicles  and  taxis,  20%  were  two-wheelers,  and  13%  were \nheavy vehicles.  \n \nDespite rapid traffic growth, the number of reported accidents has decreased from 1,039 \n6. \naccidents with 22 fatalities in 2005 to 858 accidents with 18 fatalities in 2007. This translates to \n5 annual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, which is low in comparison with other lower and middle-\nincome countries where the range is 5\u2013100 annual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. However, the \nextent  of  underreporting  of  accidents,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  not  known.  Considering  the \nhigh rate of vehicle increase, these positive statistics may not be sustained. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  DoR  under  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human  Settlement  (MoWHS)  has  direct \nresponsibility  for  2,449  km  of  roads,  comprising  1,125  km  of  national  highways,  419  km  of \ndistrict roads, 805 km of feeder roads, and 100 km of urban roads. The road network under the \nDoR has increased by almost 16%, from 2,120 km in 2005. DANTAK, an organization under the \nArmy Engineering Corp of the India Border Force, has constructed and maintained the country's \nmain road network since 1959, and continues to maintain  12% of Bhutan's main road  network \nunder a grant from the Government of India. Farm roads, forest roads, and some feeder roads \nare  managed  by  the  Departments  of Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Education,  and local roads  and \nmule tracks are the responsibility of local government authorities. The DoR is also responsible \nfor  the  management  of  the  national  workforce,  which  has  been  primarily  employed  for  force-\naccount road construction and maintenance works. \n \n8. \nThe  DoR  is  responsible  for  the  planning,  construction,  and  management  of  roads.  The \ndirector general is the technical and administrative head of the DoR, reporting to the secretary \nof  the  MoWHS.  The  headquarters  is  organized  with  four  divisions  which  are  responsible  for \nconstruction and maintenance of roads: the Survey and Design Division, the Investigation and \nDevelopment Division, the Roads Division, and the Bridge Division. The divisions are headed by \nchief engineers who are responsible for implementation of policy and overall supervision of DoR \nadministration. In addition to the four divisions, project management units are set up for special \nprojects such as those funded by ADB and the World Bank. \n \n9. \nThe DoR has eight field divisions, headed by executive engineers who are responsible \nfor the maintenance of about 300 km of roads. A field division has at least three subdivisions, \neach headed by an engineer acting as deputy executive engineer. Deputy executive engineers \nmanage  and  supervise  works  within  their  subdivisions,  involving  design  and  contract \nmanagement, including quality control and testing. Each subdivision has two further sections or \nunits,  headed  by  a  junior  engineer  who  is  the  basic  field  functionary  and  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  actual  construction  activity  in  the  field  and  taking  measurements.  Some  divisions \nhave laboratories for the mandatory testing of material. \n \n10. \nThe  existing  DoR  organization  is  fairly  well  in  line  with  the  requirement  of  road \ndevelopment  and  management.  However,  the  capacity  of  the  DoR  in  the  core  processes \n\n \n\n\f26         Appendix 2 \n\nrequires  strengthening  and  reorganization.  The  Construction  Development  Board  (CDB)  can \narrange  training  for  contractors  and  DoR  personnel  to  improve  their  skills  in  construction \nmanagement, but capacity and resources are limited. \n \nD. \n \n\nImplementation Capacity \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Implementation \n\n \n11.  Work  procurement  is  governed  by  the  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulation  2009  (PRR \n2009) with the Standard Bidding Document for procurement of works. The rules are applicable \nto all government agencies. The procurement procedures are well defined and cover all aspects \nof  procurement  such  as  registration  of  bidders,  organization  of  procurement,  procurement \nmethods,  bidding  process,  and  award  of  contract.  The  PRR  2009  also  defines  institutional \narrangements  for  addressing  grievances  in  the  procurement  process  and  establishing  a \nprocurement  policy  division.  The  Public  Procurement  Policy  Division  has  already  been \nestablished  and  is  mandated  to  monitor  implementation  of  rules  and  regulations,  and  develop \nand  administer  the  grievances  review  mechanism  and  deal  with  all  procurement-related \nfunctions  such  as  improvements  to  procedures,  research,  training,  and  capacity  development. \nPRR grants exemption to the application of rules for externally funded projects if required. \n \n12. \nThere  is  a  need  for  more  training  for  procurement  professionals  and  contractors  in \nprocurement  process,  contracts,  and  contract  implementation.  In  addition  to  the  Public \nProcurement Policy Division, the CDB is organizing training courses for contractors. Under the \nproposed Project, a consultant will be engaged for procurement assistance. \n \n13. \nThe procurement of works for the ongoing ADB-funded Road Network Project (RNP-1) is \nundertaken  by  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  which  has  successfully  completed \nprocurement  for  12  projects  so  far.  The  time  taken  from  the  date  of  bid  invitation  to  contract \neffectiveness ranged from 4 months to 7 months, except in cases where no technically qualified \nbid was obtained in the first instance which has added 2\u20133 months time for rebidding. The DoR \nis now very familiar with ADB requirements. \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  main  weaknesses  in  project  execution  are  design  finalization,  procurement,  and \nland acquisition. The DoR has increased the number of engineers, especially in the survey and \ndesign areas, and further capacity enhancement in terms of the number of engineers and skills \nand  knowledge  is  required.  For  safeguard  implementation,  the  DoR  has  strengthened  its \ncapacity to satisfy interministerial procedures, such as environmental clearance, and enhanced \nits familiarity with ADB procurement procedures. During the regional workshop, representatives \nfrom  dzongkhags  (districts)  with  project  roads  were  invited  for  discussions  to  expedite  land \nacquisition  processes.  For  procurement,  the  DoR  has  been  exposed  to  ADB  procurement \nprocedures after several ADB projects. Private sector contractors have also gained experience \nthrough a number of larger works. The DoR takes initiatives to ensure the timely completion of \nhigh-quality construction works, and these include the regular monitoring of project progress. \n \n15. \nUnder  the  Project,  the  DoR  will  outsource  design  works  to  international  engineering \nconsultants,  who  will  provide  procurement  assistance  support  including  finalizing  bidding \ndocuments.  On  safeguard  aspects,  while  dzongkhags  are  competent  authorities  for  land \nacquisition, the DoR has offered support such as surveys. The social and resettlement specialist \nunder  the  design  and  supervision  consultant  will  also  provide  training  to  the  DoR  and \ndzongkhag officers to familiarize them with ADB policies and requirements, thus improving the \n\n\fAppendix 2       27 \n\nGovernment's  capacity  in  safeguard  implementation.  The  attached  technical  assistance  will \nenhance DoR capacity in the planning and engineering of roads using modern technologies.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n16. \nThe MoWHS Accounts Division looks after the entire ministry  accounts, which includes \nthe Department of Roads. It administers both the fiscal and project accounts. MoWHS financial \nmanagement  is  guided  by  the  Financial  Rules  and  Regulations  2007  as  provided  in  the \nFinancial  Manual  2001  of  the  Government.  The  MoWHS  Accounts  Division  is  staffed  by \nexperienced  staff  deputed  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  accounting  system  is  fully \ncomputerized  (known  as  the  Budget  and  Accounting  System  [BAS]),  a  computerized  double-\nentry cash accounting system which  is used across all government agencies. The accounting \ndivision staff are well trained in the BAS. The Fixed Asset Register (FAR) is maintained for all \ngoods  purchases  and  inventoried.1 Monthly  reports  of  receipt  and  appropriation  are  generated \nby  the  BAS  and  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Public  Accounts  (DPA)  through  the  parent \nministry.  The  DPA  consolidates  the  monthly  reports  and  submits  the  annual  report  for  all  the \nagencies.  While  the  Internal  Audit  Division  carries  out  auditing  of  the  ministry\u2019s  accounts,  the \nRoyal  Audit  Authority  is  the  designated  agency  of  the  Government  for  annual  auditing  of \ngovernment and project accounts as per statutory requirement. \n \n17. \nThe  ongoing  ADB  project  has  a  full-time  accounts  officer,  assisted  by  an  accounting \nassistant,  posted  to  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  The  transactions  are  recorded \nthrough  the  BAS  and  monthly  financial  reports  are  generated  from  the  BAS.  No  particular \ndifficulty was reported by the PIU in project accounting and reporting for the Project. A separate \nproject  account  is  maintained  for  receiving  funds  from  ADB  and  the  Government.  There  has \nbeen  difficulty  and  delay  in  obtaining  required  documentation  in  a  timely  manner  from  the \ncontractors to process the payments and submit documentation for replenishment of funds from \nADB. This process is being improved and the PIU expects that the processing of both payments \nand replenishments can be done in a timely manner. \n \nADB  funds  for  the  Government  are  received  through  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority, \n18. \nwhich in turn informs the DPA. The DPA then releases the funds, as per the budget provisions \n(which  includes  the  Government\u2019s  contribution)  for  all  planned  programs  and  projects,  to  the \nexecuting agency. For projects, the PMO has a joint signatory imprest account with the Bank of \nBhutan for all appropriations, with the project manager and the accountant as the signatories. \n \n19. \nOverall,  the  financial  management  and  accounting  system  is  well  established.  The \nProject is a repeated operation and the financial management arrangements for the Project will \nremain  the  same  as  they  were  for  the  RNP-I.  The  Government  is  familiar  with  managing \nexternal funds, as well as utilizing, accounting, and reporting for the same. However, there were \nsome errors in claims submitted for the RNP-I. This was partly attributed to weak capacity of the \nPMO  and its misunderstanding of claim processing procedures. Recently, ADB has conducted \ntraining on ADB loan disbursement procedures, which was attended by project accountants and \nproject coordinators of ongoing ADB projects in Bhutan. To ensure continuity and the transfer of \ninstitutional  knowledge  from  RNP-I  for  the  Project,  DoR  officers  experienced  in  RNP-I  will \nprovide support to the new PMO on the requirement basis.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The  goods/consumables  are  not  reported  in  the  FAR,  although  a  stock  register  is  required  to  be  maintained  for \n\nshowing receipt and issue to maintain accountability. \n\n \n\n\f28         Appendix 2 \n\nRoad Transport Regulation and Industry \n\nE. \n \n20. \nThe  Road  Safety  and  Transport  Authority  (RSTA)  of  the  Ministry  of  Information  and \nCommunications is responsible for all motor vehicle-related activities including registration and \nlicensing  and  roadworthiness  and  emission  tests.  The  RSTA  regulates  the  transport  industry \nand  sets  tariffs.  The  tariffs  are  binding  for  passenger  traffic  but  are  considered  indicative  for \nfreight  as  it  only  applies  to  hiring  by  the  Government.  Large  transport  contracts  are  generally \ncontracted out by industries in open tender to both transport companies and truck owners. The \nfreight transport market is fully competitive. The size of the truck fleet has risen significantly in \nrecent years and increased competition is reported. \n \n21. \nPrivatization  of  bus  operations  was  initiated  in  1985  and  all  routes  were  privatized  by \nOctober 1999. As of June 2009, the RSTA had 124 bus routes covering 18 dzongkhags (except \nGasa  and  Pemagatshel)  operated  by  35  private  operators.  There  are  180  buses  in  operation \n(excluding  city  buses),  which  is  above  the  RSTA  public  transport  target  in  the  10th  FYP  (170 \nbuses). Private operators may propose new routes for operation for RSTA permission, which is \nprovided  based  on  assessment  of  potential  demand.  New  routes  proposed  by  RSTA  will  be \ncontracted out based on open competition, with passenger fares regulated by the RSTA on the \nbasis  of  direct  cost  plus  operational  overhead. Public  demand  for transport services  has  been \nincreasing,  and  the  frequency  of  service  has  increased  and  operation  hours  expanded.  There \ncontinues to be strong demand for more routes, and this will grow with the construction of many \nnew  roads.  To  encourage  private  operators  to  purchase  new  buses  for  better  services,  the \nRSTA  has  waived  import  duty  for  buses  as  a  subsidy  measure,  and  operation  contracts  have \nbeen extended to 10 years. \n \n22. \nThe  Road  Safety  and  Transport  Act  of  1999  defines  the  roles  of  RSTA  and  the  traffic \npolice  in  implementing  the  road  traffic  safety  rules.  The  act  reflects  modern  practice  and  the \ntraffic safety rules are in line with international standards.  \n \nF. \n \n23. \nBudgetary  expenditure  of  the  DoR  under  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP,  2002\u20132007, \nextended  to  2008)  was  Nu7,418  million  ($161  million)  against  an  original  budget  of  Nu6,566 \nmillion ($143 million). The substantial increase in expenditure is due to extension of the 9th FYP \nto 2008. The average annual expenditure is Nu1,236 million against the original average annual \nexpenditure  of  Nu1,313  million,  which  is  6%  underspending.  This  demonstrates  remarkable \nimprovement  in  DoR  capacity  and  commitment.  Under  the  10th  FYP  (2008\u20132013),  the  overall \nbudget is Nu13,708 million, which is 1.8 times (2.2 times on the annual basis) the amount in the \n9th FYP due to the new Government\u2019s priority for road rehabilitation and development.  \n \n24. \nSpecific charges for road use are taxes on motor vehicles levied by the RSTA, including \nannual registration, renewal, and ownership transfer fees, were Nu97 million in 2008, increasing \nfrom Nu60 million in 2005. In addition, road users pay sales tax on fuel and custom duties and \nsales  tax  on  vehicles,  which  was  Nu121  million  in  2005  and  Nu152  million  in  2008.  Revenue \nrelating to road  use  was  Nu249 million  in  2008, increasing from Nu181 million in  2005;  this is \nabsorbed into general government revenue. The average annual increase is very high at 15.6%. \n \nG. \n \n25. \nDespite the expansion of the road network, it requires improvement in terms of coverage \nand  condition.  Demands  of  road  transport  are  increasing.  One  of  the  major  concerns  with \n\nMain Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n\nRoad Expenditure and Revenue \n\n\fAppendix 2       29 \n\nBhutan's trunk  road  network  is that  the  country  is  dependent  on  the single  east\u2013west  national \nhighway  running through  the  northern  part  of the  country.  The  absence  of  a  similar  east\u2013west \nhighway running through the south constrains travel in the southern part. \n \n26. \nUnder  the  10th  FYP,  the  construction  of  the  Southern  East\u2013West  Highway  is  a  major \nroad  infrastructure  development  priority,  in  addition  to  road  construction  connecting  to \nhydropower projects. The Southern East\u2013West Highway will facilitate industrial development in \nthe  southern  economic  hubs  and  special  economic  zones  and  integrate  them  more  effectively \nwith  their  primary  markets in  India. Additionally,  the Southern East\u2013West  Highway  will  provide \nan internal transit route for Bhutanese passengers and goods, i.e., an alternative to the existing \neast\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the country. The 10th FYP also \nput priority on continued maintenance and management of road assets, quality assurance and \nstandardization, and strengthening of the road construction industry. \n \n\n1. \n\nDepartment of Roads Capacity Building \n\n \n27. \nThere was only a very limited role for Government staff, local engineers, and contractors \nin  road  planning,  construction,  and  management  until  the  early  1990s.  Since  the  8th  FYP \n(1997\u20132002), the Government and domestic private sector contractors have gained experience \nin road sector development and management, and the total DoR budget under the 10th FYP is \nNu13.7  billion.  To  manage  the  massive  investment  in  roads,  the  DoR  has  initiated  capacity \nstrengthening  and  the  streamlining  of  its  business  procedures.  One  of  the  major  initiatives \nincludes  corporatization  of  the  mechanical  division  with  the  establishment  of  the  Construction \nDevelopment  Corporation  (CDC)  in  July  2007.  Utilization  of  equipment  and  work  efficiency  of \nthe CDC has been increased. \n \nThe DoR will continue to further strengthen its capacity in both the policy and planning \n28. \nand engineering and technical aspects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has \nprovided engineers on a long-term basis to the DoR to strengthen its engineering capacity. SNV \nBhutan has provided experts to provide training for design and construction with environmental \nconsiderations.  Under  the  proposed  attached  TA,  assistance  will  be  provided  in  asset \nmanagement  and  road  technologies  of  survey,  design,  and  construction,  and  especially  on \nenvironmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) methods. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing \n\n29. \nDuring the extended 9th FYP (2002\u20132008), the expenditure on resurfacing was Nu1,215 \nmillion for 1,285 km and for routine maintenance was Nu623 million for 2,307 km. The average \ncost per km of Nu945,000 for resurfacing and Nu45,000 for routine maintenance is considered \nappropriate.  The  average  annual  length  scheduled  for  resurfacing  was  214  km,  which  is \nconsidered to be about a 7-year resurfacing period. \n \nUnder  the  10th FYP,  the  budget for  resurfacing  is Nu1,389 million for  a  planned  1,415 \n30. \nkm, and for routine maintenance Nu784 million. The budget per km is considered adequate and \nthe average annual length for resurfacing is about 280 km, which is about a 30% increase from \nthe 9th FYP. All roads are now in a periodic maintenance cycle. The average cost per km both \nfor  resurfacing  and  routine  maintenance  has  been  increased  to  ensure  better  quality  through \nmore mechanization. \n \n31. \nEfficiency of the use of the maintenance  budget has also improved. The productivity of \nthe  large  national  workforce  for  routine  maintenance  has  been  improved  during  the  9th  FYP \n\n \n\n\f30         Appendix 2 \n\n3. \n\nfrom  1  km  per  person  to  1.5  km  per  person  through  scheduled  retirements,  a  freeze  on  new \nrecruitment,  and increasing mechanization.  A recent  DoR initiative includes  the introduction  of \nperformance-based contracts in routine maintenance for a batch of road sections to a group of \nroad workers. The DoR continues to improve the road asset management systems for optimal \nallocation of the  budget.  The construction industry\u2019s experience with mechanized roadworks is \nincreasing  as  the  volume  of  works  increases.  These  actions  demonstrate  the  Government\u2019s \nincreased commitment to maintenance and the increased efficiency of road maintenance works. \n \n32. \nTaking  into  account  the  past  budgetary  provision  and  the  trend,  the  Government  is \nassessed as being able to adequately provide maintenance financing in a sustainable manner. \nIncreased  maintenance  quality  and  productivity  due  to  increased  mechanization,  quality \nassurance  systems,  the  recent  introduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  routine \nmaintenance,  and  more  adoption  of  EFRC  techniques  and  appropriate  road  technologies,  will \nalso  increase  the  efficiency  of  maintenance  works  and  hence  reduce  maintenance  costs.  The \nGovernment  has  given  assurances  that  it  will  provide  adequate  financing  to  maintain  roads \ndeveloped under Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \n \n \n \n33. \nConstruction quality is a critical element for sustainable operation and management, and \nachieving it requires strengthening the capacity of both the Government and the private sector \nin  quality  assurance  and  control.  The  Government  mandates  the  DoR  to  review  design  for  all \nroads, including farm roads, which will enhance the quality of roads at all levels. Considerations \nwould  also  require  the  use  of  appropriate  design  and  technology  for  building  roads  in  the \ncontext of Bhutan, including traffic, weather, and soil conditions. Simple, low-cost methods are \noften more appropriate and effective in terms of construction speed, quality, and environmental \nconsideration,  e.g.,  use  of  natural  gravel,  etc.  The  proposed  Project  will  consider  design  and \ntechnology for simple, low-cost methods as appropriate. \n \n34. \nThe  Standards  and  Quality  Control  Authority  (SQCA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Works  and \nHuman Settlement is responsible for improving quality assurance. A technical specification was \nrenewed  and  published  in  February  2005,  incorporating  environmental  considerations.  All \nconstruction materials require certification by SQCA for use. The proposed attached TA project \nwill  provide  training  in  road  technologies,  which  will  help  improve  quality  during  the  survey, \ndesign, and construction phases. \n \n\nConstruction Quality \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Industry \n\n \n35.  With  limited  works  in  the  past,  the  local  construction  industry  has  little  capacity. \nHowever,  local  contractors  have  gained  experience  since  the  8th  FYP,  and  there  has  been \nfurther  promotion  of  private  sector  participation under  the  9th FYP. The  amount  of  contracting \nout  to  the  private  sector  has  increased  from  Nu70  million  under  the  7th  FYP  (1992\u20131997)  to \nNu1,027  million  under  the  8th  FYP  (1997\u20132002)  and  Nu3,806  million  under  the  9th  FYP.  The \ncontract  awards  under  ADB's  Road  Improvement  Project2 (Nu500  million)  and  Road  Network \nProject3 (Nu1,232 million) greatly contributed to this increase. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Bhutan for the Road Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n3   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \n\nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Network Project. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 2       31 \n\n36. \nThe Construction Development Board (CDB) has a computerized registration system for \ncontractors and an interim mechanism for dispute resolution. The CDB will continue with these \nconstruction  development  services,  research  and  technology  development,  and  awareness  of \nbest  practices.  Training  provided  under  the  attached  TA  project  could  be  open  to  private \ncontractors. \n \nUnder the 10th FYP, the DoR will coordinate all roadwork contracts to be outsourced to \n37. \nthe  private  sector.  Regional  and  internationally  accredited  engineering  and  construction  firms \nwill  also  be  encouraged  to  participate,  in  joint  ventures  with  national  construction  firms  where \nnecessary,  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  project  delivery.  Under  the  Project, \ninternational competitive bidding will be adopted. \n \n\n5. \n\nVehicle Pollution Control \n\n \nTo minimize pollution, the Government made a pollution control certificate for all vehicles \n38. \ncompulsory,  and  so  all  vehicles  are  required  to  have  pollution  checks.  The  RSTA  encourages \nthe establishment of private  sector pollution check centers, and there are two  such centers  so \nfar\u2014in  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing.  The  Government  has  continued  to  establish  permanent \npollution check centers, but needs to establish more centers in major cities, with emission test \nmachines to be installed in each center.  \n \n\n6. \n\nOverloading \n\n \n39. \nOverloading  is  an  emerging  problem  in  Bhutan  as  the  size  of  vehicles  increases.  It  is \nalso  expected  that  overloaded  trucks  will  operate  on  the  major  national  highways  as  the \neconomy  grows.  An  overloading  control  program  is  being  set  up  with  initial  installation  of \nweighbridges at major border points such as Gelephu, Jongkhar, Phuentsholing, Samdrup and \nSamtse. Mobile weighbridges are available and more weighbridges will be installed in industrial \ntowns. An overloading penalty of Nu500 per ton is strictly enforced.  \n \n\n7. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n40. \nBhutan  has  a  lower  accident  rate  compared  with  other  lower  and  middle-income \ncountries.  However,  the  extent  of  underreporting  of  accidents,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  not \nknown.  Considering  the  high  growth  of  the  vehicle  fleet,  these  positive  statistics  may  not  be \nsustained. \n \n41. \nThe Road Safety and Transport Regulation of 1999 provides regulations for registration \nand  licensing,  commercial  passenger  vehicles,  traffic  control,  and  enforcement  mechanisms. \nMeasures have been taken to educate all drivers on basic safety precautions and many driving \nrefresher  courses  have  been  organized.  Vehicle  inspections  have  been  conducted,  including \npredeparture inspection for buses and inspection of all vehicles every year, except commercial \nvehicles for  which inspection  is  conducted  every  half  year.

Suitable modifications \nand  additions  have  been  incorporated  to  suit  local  conditions  and  study  requirements.  The \nproject roads covered under this study are characterized by steep mountains and deep gorges. \nFactors  such  as  weak  geology,  varying  topography  and  climate conditions,  and  environmental \nrequirements dictate the choice of road alignment. Short sections of the road however do pass \nthrough rolling to hilly terrain. \n  \n3. \nThe general principle adopted was to follow the existing alignment as much as possible \nto  limit  the  extent  of  land  acquisition  and  earthworks  and  to  maximize  the  use  of  the  existing \nroad formation. Where the existing alignment proved unsafe for suggested traffic speeds, minor \nhorizontal  realignments  are  proposed  for  some  of  the  sections  to  improve  safety  and  general \ndrivability.  The  major  geometric  design  elements  constituting  the  cross-section  are  the \ncarriageway, the shoulders, and the side drain. The carriageways include the traveled way and \npassing bays. \n \n4. \n\nA detailed description of the design approach is as follows: \n\nCross-section. For national highways: two lanes, single carriageway, 5.5 meters \n(m)  wide  with  earth  shoulders  1.5  m  wide.  For  feeder  roads:  single  lane,  single \ncarriageway, 3.50 m wide, with 0.5 m earth shoulders and passing bays. \n\n \n\nRights-of-way. A 30 m wide right of way has been recommended for all project \nroads  to  accommodate  future  road  connections  or  changes  in  alignment,  road \nwidth,  or  junction  layout  of  existing  roads,  and  to  improve  the  safety,  safety \noperation, and appearance of the roads. \n\n(iii) \n\nDesign  speed.  As  per  the  Bhutanese  standards,  60  km  per  hour  will  be  the \ndesign  speed.  This  is,  however,  only  economically  justifiable  in  flat  or  rolling \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34      Appendix 4 \n\nterrain.  As all roads are in steep mountains and deep gorges, design speeds of \n40 km per hour were justifiable and therefore applied.  \n\n(iv) \n\nDesign life. Twenty years after opening to traffic (2032). \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nPavement.  The  pavements  are  designed  for  10  years  and  take  into  account \nprojected traffic loading, existing pavement structure, subgrade California bearing \nratio (a test of subgrade mechanical strength), and quality of materials available. \nFor  national  highways,  double  bituminous  surface  treatment  surfacing,  wet  mix \nmacadam base course, and profile correction is recommended. For feeder roads, \nunsealed gravel surface course is recommended. \n\n(vi) \n\nBridges.  The  highway  has  several  bridges.  The  bridge  types  recommended  is \nreinforced cement concrete (RCC) for up to 20 m spans. \n\n(vii)  Drainage.  The  drainage  system  recommended  includes  culverts,  bridges,  and \nside  drains,  cut-off  drains,  and  catch  water  drains.  RCC  slab  culverts  are \nrecommended.  \n\nIn addition, the following safety and roadside features will be incorporated: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRoad safety structures (breast walls, retaining walls, toe walls, and check walls), \nwill be reconstructed. Their heights range from 1.0 m to 8.0 m, with an average of \n2.7 m. \n\nBus  stops  with  passenger  shelters  and  truck  turnoffs  will  be  constructed  at \nappropriate locations. \n\nGuard  rails  and  crash  barriers  will  be  constructed  at  identified  high-risk  points \n(although this is limited to what is economically justifiable); however, the following \nengineering measures will increase safety: \n \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\nall curve radii will correspond to design speeds, \nall required widening at curves will be provided, \nadequate road width will be provided with easy gradients, \nvision berms will be provided at curves, and \nproper road markings and signs will be provided. \n\n \n5. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nProper  road  furniture\u2014including  road  signs,  road  markings,  kilometer  posts, \nright-of-way pillars, and guard posts\u2014will be provided. \n\n \n6. \nConstruction  will  incorporate  environmental  consideration  in  design  and  construction \nnow being applied on selected road projects in Bhutan. This will minimize damage to the natural \nenvironment by \n \n\nusing controlled blasting, \nlimiting the use of bulldozers (excavator-tipper combinations will be used instead), \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  using log and boulder barriers to control slipping of blasted or excavated materials, \n\nand \nincorporating bioengineering techniques. \n\n(iv) \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nLocal \n\n  \n  A. \n \n \n  B. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  C. \n \n \n  D. \n \n \n  E. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  F. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nManitar\u2013Raidak Road \nRaidak\u2013Lhamaozingkha Road \nPanbang\u2013Amshingwoong (Nganglam) \nTsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Durung Ri Road \nSamdrupcholing\u2013Samrang Road \nSubtotal (B) \n \n\n  \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n \nCivil Worksa \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n \n \nDesign Consultant \n \nSupervision Consultant \n \nCapacity Building (Equipment) \n \n \n \nContingencies \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n     ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n     a Cost estimates are based on preliminary design and includes environmental mitigation.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Bhutan  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  identifies  remoteness  and  isolation  as  the  major  causes  of  poverty  in \nBhutan,  and  prioritizes  the  extension  and  improvement  of  physical  infrastructure,  including  communications  and  planned \nurbanization, as strategic interventions to combat poverty. The Government has given the development of road infrastructure \nthe highest priority in the  10th Five-Year  Plan. The Bhutan country  operations  business plan (2008\u20132010)a  prioritizes Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to the transport sector to enhance the connectivity and accessibility of remote and rural \nareas.  \n \nMore  than  half  of  the  population  of  Bhutan  lives  in  rural  areas.  Road  network  connectivity  is  therefore  a  key  factor  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s overall development goals. For this reason, the Government is highly committed to developing and promoting \nthe proposed Project, from which a larger part of the population is expected to benefit. Access to roads in rural areas is a key \nelement  of  human  development  and  economic  growth.  It  is  also  expected  to  improve  health  care  services  and  education. \nMost of all, it means a greater range of opportunities for rural people to improve their quality of life and capacity to generate \nincome. It will also improve the living conditions of women and children. Another immediate tangible benefit is the reduction of \ntime  spent  in  travelling  and  therefore  the  increase  in  productivity  by  more  business  opportunities  and  employment  in  rural \nareas of Bhutan.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n\n \nRemoteness and isolation are the major causes of poverty in Bhutan. The construction of national highways and feeder roads \ncovering 183.0 kilometers (km) (Manitar\u2013Raidak, 37.0 km; Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha, 25.0 km; Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong, 36.0 \nkm;  Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang,  23.0  km;  and  Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Shingchungri,  62.0  km)  will  have  direct  benefits  for  the  local \npopulation  (poor  people,  vulnerable  groups,  and  households  headed  by  women).  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the \nquality of life and bring new economic opportunities to remote areas of the country. It is also expected to increase economic \nactivity (particularly in small retail) at the road sites and increased accessibility due to construction of access roads connected \nto the main roads.  \n \nThe  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  very  positive:  access  to  health  care  facilities  and  education,  improved \ncommunication  facilities,  easy  transportation  of  cash  crops,  and  vibrant  growth  of  economic  activities  in  the  rural  villages. \nRural  electrification  is  also  expected to  improve once  road connectivity  is  established.  This  will  permit  students  to study  for \nlonger hours in the evening, and contribute to a cleaner living environment through the use of electricity and gas for cooking, \nthus also saving the forests from further degradation. \n \nThe  income-generation  activities  of  the  population  of  the  immediate  and  wider  project  influence  areas  are  expected  to \nincrease  through  sales  of  local  produce  at  the  road  sites  almost  on  a  daily  basis.  As  a  result,  the  Project  will  significantly \nreduce  the  poverty  level  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  the  five  beneficiary  dzongkhags  (districts)\u2014Chhukha,  Dagana, \nPemagatshel, Samdrupjongkhar, and Zhemgang\u2014through connectivity of these remote rural areas. \n \n2.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThis  analysis  covers  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  the  proposed  five  roads  under  the  Project.  The  household  survey \ncovered 68 villages: 22 villages on the Manitar\u2013Raidak road, 16 villages on the Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha road, 8 villages on \nthe Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong road, 8 villages on the Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang road, and 14 villages on the Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013\nShingchungri  road.  The  questionnaire  developed  for  this  survey  was  based  on  the  requirements  of  the  Project  terms  of \nreference,  with  reference  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  ADB  Operations  (1993)b  and \nADB\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis (2001)c. \n \nThe survey was based on a random sampling approach using population size. The household survey began meeting with the \nvillage headman or a representative of the geog (block), through which either the existing road passed or through which the \nproposed  national  roads  might  be  aligned.  Twenty  percent  of  the  total  households  of  gewogs  (villages)  were  selected  for \ninterview by randomly selecting the visibly poor and rich households. Consultation with the communities (324 male and 162 \nfemale  participants)  and  16  focus  group  discussions  at  different  levels  were  another  component.  These  activities  were \nconducted  simultaneously  with  the  household  survey  and  by  the  same  survey  team  at  different  times  and  locations.  The \ndiscussions were conducted in different part of the villages falling under the same geog and within the project influence area \nregardless  of  the  affected  persons.  All  the  respondent  sample  households  reported  that  most  women  spend  time  on \npurchasing household items, collecting drinking water and fuel wood and supporting cultivation. Women in villages  are also \nactively involved in religious and cultural activities.  \n \nSince most of the villages are located far from motorable roads, the villagers have to walk a considerable distance to reach \nthe road heads. There are community, primary, lower secondary, middle secondary, higher secondary, and private schools in \nall the five dzongkhags. In most of the villages, children walk for 30 minutes to 3 hours to get to school. There are basic health \nunits, outreach clinics, and general  hospitals in  all the five dzongkhags.  Not  all the houses have drinking water due  to poor \nwater sources.  \n\nThe  people  in  the  influence  areas  are  agricultural  farmers,  with  90%  being  engaged  in  agricultural  activities.  Some \nhouseholds reported combining their agricultural activities with shopkeeping and with some wage activities. The main cereals \ngrown are rice, maize, wheat, and millet. The cash crops grown are mainly areca nut, oranges, and cardamom. The villagers \nalso tend to cattle farming and produce milk, cheese, and butter, which are locally consumed, and the surpluses are sold. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. A socioeconomic survey covering 20% of the total households of geogs, and 16 focus group discussions were conducted in \nFebruary\u2013April 2009 to gather feedback from the local communities on the proposed development, perceived socioeconomic \nimpacts, and acceptable alignment of the access road. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, high-income \ngroups, poor people, shopkeepers, and government officials to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the project as well as \nits impacts. \n \n2.    What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThe C&P plan was prepared to inform and collate public views to facilitate informed decisions. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nGender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by undertaking a process of gender analysis so as to \nassess  the  impact  of  the  Project.  Sixteen  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  belonging  to  different \nsocioeconomic  groups  such  as  high-income,  poor,  and  women  of  different  ethnicity.  These  discussions  revealed  that  the \nmajority of the women felt that the roads will benefit them as they will be able to transport their yield for market and this will \nhelp increase income. The study revealed no significant discrimination against women in Bhutan. The socioeconomic survey \nshowed  that,  although  some  activities  may  be  predominantly  undertaken  by  women  or  men,  women  and  men  traditionally \nhave equal status for most socioeconomic activities. The studies also revealed that rural women are becoming more visible in \nboth household and other activities, and women are frequently taking on additional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for \ntheir families. Along with men in the project areas, women will benefit from (i) easier access to external markets, (ii) increased \nlocal  retailing  opportunities, and  (iii)  easier  access  to health  care  centers  and  education  facilities. Women  may  also  benefit \nmore than men from the increased access to schools. Traditionally enrolment rates in schools have been lower for girls than \nfor boys. \n\n \n\n\f 50            Appendix 11 \n \n2.
