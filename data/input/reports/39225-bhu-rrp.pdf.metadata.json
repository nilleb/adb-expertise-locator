The \nsummary  of  the  assessment  is  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors separately. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will upgrade or construct five critical sections (about \n180 kilometers [km]) of the southern east\u2013west highway, including \n(i)  Manitar\u2013Raidak,  (ii)  Raidak\u2013Lhamoizingkha,  (iii)  Panbang\u2013\nAmshingwoong (Nganglam), (iv) Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Durung Ri, and \n(v)  Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang.  Consulting  services  will  be \nprovided to prepare detailed design and support implementation \nof the civil works. These proposed road sections provide access \nto the border crossings and have significant regional implications. \nRoad  improvement  and  construction  works  under  the  Project \ninclude construction of roadways, including longitudinal drainage \nstructures, installation of culverts and bridges, construction of new \nbridges  and  cross-drainage  structures,  and  structures  for \nresettlement and rehabilitation. \n \nThe Project will also enhance overall sector management capacity \nby providing (i) equipment necessary for the Royal Government of \nBhutan to enhance sector capacity in areas such as (a) quality \nsurvey, design, and construction, (b) road safety, and (c) control \nof overloading and vehicle emissions; (ii) on-the-job training for \nsocial and environmental requirements through detailed design \nand  construction  supervision  consultants;  and  (iii)  technical \nassistance (TA) to support the capacity building of the Department \nof Roads (DoR), including (a) enhancing knowledge of and skills \nin  modern  road  technologies,  especially  with  environmental \nconsiderations; and (b) enhancing and optimizing the road asset \nmanagement systems. \n   \nRationale  Accessibility is Bhutan\u2019s key development issue\u2014the trunk road \nnetwork  is  dependent  on  a  single  east\u2013west  national  highway \nrunning through the northern part of the country. The absence of a \nsimilar  east\u2013west  highway  running  through  the  south  has \nconstrained travel in the southern part and hence development \nopportunities,  including  potential  trade  with  India.  Limited ", "ii   \nprovision of feeder roads adds to the isolation of remote southern \nrural areas. The proposed Project will construct critical sections of \nthe  southern  east\u2013west  highway,  which  will  facilitate  industrial \ndevelopment  in  the  southern  areas  and  integrate  them  more \neffectively with their primary markets in India. \n \nThe  DoR,  which  is  in  charge  of  road  development  and \nmanagement, is limited by traditional road-building technologies, \nwhich often lead to cost and time overruns in project delivery. For \nefficient and effective road asset development and management, \nthe DoR needs to be equipped with knowledge, skills, and tools \nfor the use of modern technologies in planning, survey, design, \nand  construction,  especially  with  regard  to  environmental \nconsiderations. Improved road safety and control of overloading \nand vehicle emissions are also required for the safe and efficient \nuse of road assets with minimal adverse environmental impacts. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will increase passenger and freight transport within \nthe country and with India, facilitate industrial development in the \nsouth of the country, a remote area with a high poverty incidence \nbut high agricultural and industrial development potential. It will \nalso integrate the south more effectively with its primary markets \nin India. The Project will expand the road transport network in the \nsouthern  region,  providing  a  major  internal  transit  route  for \nBhutanese  passengers  and  goods  (i.e.,  an  alternative  to  the \nexisting east\u2013west national highway running through the northern \npart of the country), connecting to border crossings with India. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $54.32 million, \nincluding taxes and duties.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  grant  of  $38.76  million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, inclusive of a $10.00 \nmillion grant from the subregional pool of the Asian Development \nFund. The Government will finance the remaining local cost of \n$15.56 million equivalent, or 28.6% of the total cost, including \ntaxes and duties, land acquisition, remuneration of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, and other miscellaneous costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Roads (DoR) \n   \nImplementation  The project management office (PMO) will be headed by a full-\nArrangements  time project coordinator at the executive engineer level, supported \nby adequate technical and administrative personnel. The PMO will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  overall  coordination,  management  and \nmonitoring of the Project, (ii) supervision of detailed engineering ", "  iii \ndesign, and (iii) procurement. In addition to the PMO, two site \noffices shall be established to be responsible for monitoring day-\nto-day implementation of the Project and preparation of project \nprogress reports, each to be headed by a project manager at the \nassistant engineer level. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive bidding with domestic margin of preference. ADB is \ncurrently  updating  the  list  of  countries  eligible  for  domestic \npreference, which will be issued shortly. If Bhutan is not on the \nupdated  list  of  eligible  countries  at  the  time  of  bidding,  the \ndomestic preference referred to elsewhere in this report will not be \napplicable to this Project. \n \nThe Project will provide $1 million for equipment to be procured \nand will follow international competitive bidding procedures if the \nestimated  contract  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000,  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures if the estimated contract is valued \nbetween $100,000 and $500,000, and shopping if the estimated \ncontract amount is less than $100,000. \n   \nConsulting Services  Two  international  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited:  one  for \ndetailed  design  and  procurement  assistance,  and  another  for \nconstruction supervision of civil works under the Project. The DoR \nwill select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nFor  detailed  design  and  procurement  assistance,  about  34 \nperson-months of international consultants and 32 person-months \nof  national  consultants  will  be  required.  For  construction \nsupervision,  an  estimated  28  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 604 person-months of national consultants will be \nprovided. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Improving management of the country's road network through the \nBeneficiaries  capacity building component and the TA, and the construction of \ncritical  sections of  the country's  trunk road  network  under the \nProject, will enhance rural accessibility in the southern area as \nwell as expand the country's trunk road network by providing an \nalternate east\u2013west link. This will reduce poverty incidence and \nimprove the quality of life in the remote southern areas. It will also \nintegrate  these  areas  with  the  national  and  subregional \neconomies through reduced travel time, accidents, overloading, \nand  vehicle  emissions.  The  Project  will  increase  the  DoR's \ncapacity for road asset development and management. This will \nensure the delivery of more efficient road asset development and \nmanagement, and higher-quality construction and maintenance, \n ", "iv   \nresulting in decreased recurrent costs in the medium and long \nterm. These will increase the overall level of social and economic \ndevelopment in Bhutan.  \n \nRemoteness  and isolation  are  the major  causes  of  poverty  in \nBhutan.  The  Project  will  improve  access  to  socioeconomic \nservices,  increase  employment  opportunities  and  income-\ngeneration activities, and improve transport services. These major \npositive impacts of the Project will significantly reduce poverty and \nimprove the quality of life in the project-influenced areas covering \nfive  dzongkhags  (districts):  Chhukha,  Dagana,  Pemagatshel, \nSamdrupjongkhar, and Zhemgang. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk of delayed implementation will be mitigated through (i) \nthe  DoR\u2019s  advance  actions  and  ADB's  prior  review  of \nprocurement,  (ii)  more  hands-on  advice  during  procurement \nprocesses, and (iii) on-the-job training on safeguard requirements \nto the DoR and dzongkhag officials. The DoR will provide required \nsupport to dzongkhag offices to facilitate land acquisition. \n \nThe  risk  of  ad  hoc  design  changes,  which  could  result  in \nrealignment leading to implementation delay, has been minimized \nthrough full consultation with local communities and dzongkhag \nofficials. Technical advice will be provided by the consultant under \nthe  attached  TA  and  design  and  supervision  consultants  on \nappropriate  technologies  with  environmental  considerations, \nwhich will ensure projects are implemented in a timely manner \nand are of high quality. \n \nThe risk of inadequate maintenance financing is mitigated with \ncontinued  support  to  asset  management  planning  through  the \nattached  TA.  Sufficient  budget  was  allocated  to  the  targeted \nlength under the 9th Five-Year Plan, and the target length and \nbudget were increased under the 10th Five-Year Plan. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, TA will be provided for capacity \nbuilding of the DoR. The DoR will be equipped with skills in and \nknowledge  of  modern  road  technologies  in  planning,  survey, \ndesign, and construction, with environmental considerations. The \nestimated total cost of the TA is $500,000, of which ADB will \nfinance  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA  funding \nprogram  (Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV).  The  TA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Road Network Project II. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Capacity Building of the Department of Roads, and if the Board \napproves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  In a landlocked country such as Bhutan, socioeconomic development depends largely \non an efficient and reliable road network. Since the construction of the 179-kilometer (km) \nPhuentsholing\u2013Thimphu Highway in 1959, the national road network has expanded to about \n4,947 km of motorable roads, including 1,632 km of national highways, 489 km of district roads, \n813 km of feeder roads, 150 km of urban roads, 717 km of farm roads, and 560 km of forest \nroads. This gives a road density of 0.13 km per square km and 7.5 km per 1,000 inhabitants. \nThe km per inhabitants figure is relatively high in comparison with countries of similar size and \nincome level; this is due to Bhutan\u2019s low population density. Despite the extent of the present \nroad  network,  many  rural  communities  remain  unconnected.  The  census  survey  of  2005 \nindicates that 9.7% of the population lives more than 6 hours away from the nearest road, and \nthat rural households in six districts comprise 73% of such population. Travel between east and \nwest regions relies on a single east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of \nthe country, or it requires going through India, especially in southern areas of the country. Only \none airport provides limited air access to the rest of the world. \n \n3.  Almost all national highways (95%), more than 90% of the district and urban roads, and \nabout 20% of feeder roads are paved. However, road conditions are poor. Narrow roads have \nbeen built along steep hillsides prone to landslides. Roads become difficult to use during the \nwinter months and rainy season. Improvement, maintenance, and expansion of the existing \nroad network are urgently needed. Because of the mountainous terrain, the area of land suitable \nfor  agriculture  is  limited  and  the  population  of  less  than  700,000  is  distributed  in  remote \nsettlements. This makes construction and maintenance of roads extremely difficult and costly. \nThe wide use of manual resurfacing has provided low-quality pavement. \n \n4.  The Department of Roads (DoR) under the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement \nhas  direct  responsibility  for  2,449  km  of  road  network,  comprising  1,125  km  of  national \nhighways, 419 km of district roads, 805 km of feeder roads, and 100 km of urban roads. \nDANTAK, an organization under the Army Engineering Corp of the Indian Border Force, has \nconstructed and maintained the country's main road network since 1959 and continues to \nmaintain 12% of Bhutan's main road network under a grant from the Government of India. Farm \nroads, forest roads, and some feeder roads are managed by the Departments of Agriculture, \nForestry  and  Education,  and  local  roads  and  mule  tracks  are  the  responsibility  of  local \ngovernment authorities. The DoR is also responsible for managing the national workforce, which \nhas been primarily employed for force-account road construction and maintenance works. \n \n5.  Budgetary expenditure of the DoR under the 9th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2002\u20132007, \nextended to 2008) was Nu7,418 million ($161 million) against an original budget of Nu6,566 \nmillion ($143 million). The substantial increase in expenditure was due to extension of the 9th \nFYP to 2008. The average annual expenditure was Nu1,236 million against the original average ", "2   \nannual  expenditure  of  Nu1,313  million,  which  is  6%  underspending.  This  demonstrates \nremarkable improvement in the DoR's capacity and commitment. Under the 10th FYP (2008\u2013\n2013), the budget is 1.8 times (2.2 times on the annual basis) as large as the 9th FYP due to \nthe newly elected government\u2019s priority for road rehabilitation and development.  \n \n6.  Specific charges for road use are taxes on motor vehicles levied by the Road Safety and \nTransport Authority (RSTA), including annual registration, renewal, and ownership transfer fees, \nand these were Nu97 million in 2008, increasing from Nu60 million in 2005. In addition, road \nusers pay sales tax on fuel, and custom duties and sales tax on vehicles, which were Nu121 \nmillion in 2005 and Nu152 million in 2008. Revenue relating to road use was Nu249 million in \n2008, increasing from Nu181 million in 2005, which is absorbed into the general government \nrevenue. The average annual increase was very high at 15.6%. \n \n7.  The RSTA of the Ministry of Information and Communications is responsible for all motor \nvehicle-related activities including registration and licensing and roadworthiness and emission \ntests. The number of motor vehicle registrations increased from 29,914 in 2005 to 35,703 in \n2007, which is an average annual increase of 9.2%. The highest increase was in light vehicles \nat 13%, and there was not much increase in two-wheelers. Out of 35,703 motor vehicles \nregistered, over 60% were light vehicles and taxis, 20% were two-wheelers, and 13% were \nheavy vehicles.  \n \n8.  The RSTA regulates the transport industry and sets tariffs. The tariffs are binding for \npassenger traffic but considered indicative for freight. Large transport contracts are generally \ncontracted out by industries in open tender to both transport companies and truck owners. The \nfreight transport market is fully competitive. The size of the truck fleet has risen significantly in \nrecent years and increased competition is reported. For passenger transport, all bus services \nwere privatized by October 1999. As of June 2009, the RSTA had 124 bus routes covering 18 \ndzongkhags  (except  Gasa  and  Pemagatshel),  currently  operated  by  35  private  operators, \nexcluding city buses, which is above the RSTA public transport target in the 10th FYP of 170 \nbuses in operation. New routes proposed by either private operators or the RSTA will be \ncontracted out through open competition with passenger fares regulated by the RSTA with the \ndirect  cost  plus  operational  overhead.  Public  demand  for  transport  services  has  been \nincreasing, and the frequency of service has increased and operation hours have expanded. \nDemands for more routes will further grow with the construction of many new roads. The RSTA \nintroduced measures to encourage private operators to offer better services: waiving of import \nduty for purchasing new buses, and extending operation contracts to 10 years. \n \n9.  The Road Safety and Transport Act of 1999 defines the roles of the RSTA and the traffic \npolice in implementing the road traffic safety rules. The act reflects modern practice and the \ntraffic safety rules are in line with international standards. Despite rapid traffic growth, the \nnumber of reported accidents decreased from 1,039 accidents with 22 fatalities in 2005 to 858 \naccidents with 18 fatalities in 2007. This translates to 5 annual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, \nwhich is low in comparison with lower and middle-income countries, where the range is 5\u2013100 \nannual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. \n10.  The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 \nprovides more details of the road sector in Bhutan.   \n \n \n ", "  3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n11.  Despite the expansion of the road network, the coverage and condition of the country's \nroad network needs improving, and the demands of road transport are increasing. One of the \nmajor concerns with Bhutan's trunk road network is that the country is dependent on a single \neast\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the country. The absence of a \nsimilar east\u2013west highway running through the south has constrained travel in the south. \n \n12.  Under the 10th FYP, the construction of the Southern East\u2013West Highway is a major \nroad  infrastructure  development  priority,  in  addition  to  road  construction  connecting  to \nhydropower projects. The country\u2019s southern regions hold the greatest promise for industrial \ngrowth, as evidenced by industrial developments in selected areas that already benefit from \nconnectivity. Additionally, the Southern East\u2013West Highway will also provide an internal transit \nroute  for  Bhutanese  passengers  and  goods,  i.e.,  an  alternative  to  the  existing  east\u2013west \nnational highway running through the northern part of the country. The Southern East\u2013West \nHighway  will  facilitate  industrial  development  in  the  southern  economic  hubs  and  special \neconomic zones, and integrate them more effectively with their primary markets in India. Being \na landlocked country, road access plays a vital part in the trade and commerce of Bhutan. India \nis the largest trading partner accounting for 90% of the country's imports and 70% of its exports. \nBhutan's trade and economic communications with other South Asian countries depends on \nroute through India. Currently, there is only one road corridor that connects Bhutan with India, \nlocated in western Bhutan. To increase trade flows, reduce transaction costs, and provide \ngreater regional integration of the national road network and better trade facilities, the Southern \nEast\u2013West  Highway  will  connect  to  border  access  points,  thus  improving  regional  road \nconnections between Bhutan and India, and through India to Bangladesh and Nepal. The 10th \nFYP also gives priority to continued maintenance and management of road assets, quality \nassurance and standardization, and strengthening of the road construction industry. \n \na.  Department of Roads Capacity Building \n \n13.  Until the early 1990s, there was only a very limited role for Government staff, local \nengineers, and contractors in road planning, construction, and management until the early \n1990s.  Since  the  8th  FYP  (1997\u20132002),  the  Government  and  domestic  private  sector \ncontractors have gained experience in road sector development and management, and the total \nDoR budget under the 10th FYP is Nu13.7 billion. To manage the large investment in roads, the \nDoR has initiated capacity strengthening and the streamlining of its business procedures. One \nof the major initiatives includes corporatization of the mechanical division with the establishment \nof the Construction Development Corporation (CDC) in July 2007. Utilization of equipment and \nwork efficiency of the CDC has been increased. \n \n14.  The DoR will continue to further strengthen its capacity in both the policy and planning \nand engineering and technical aspects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has \nprovided engineers on a long-term basis to the DoR to strengthen its engineering capacity. SNV \nBhutan has provided experts to provide training for design and construction with environmental \nconsiderations.  Under  the  proposed  attached  TA,  assistance  will  be  provided  in  asset \nmanagement and road technologies of survey, design, and construction, and especially on \nenvironmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) methods. \n \n \n ", "4   \nb.

During the extended 9th FYP (2002\u20132008), the expenditure on resurfacing was Nu1,215 \nmillion for 1,285 km and for routine maintenance was Nu623 million for 2,307 km. The average \ncost per km of Nu945,000 for resurfacing and Nu45,000 for routine maintenance is considered \nappropriate.  The  average  annual  length  scheduled  for  resurfacing  was  214  km,  which  is \nconsidered to be about a 7-year resurfacing period. \n \n16.  Under the 10th FYP, the budget for resurfacing is Nu1,389 million for a planned 1,415 \nkm, and for routine maintenance Nu784 million. The budget per km is considered adequate and \nthe average annual length for resurfacing is about 280 km, which is about a 30% increase from \nthe 9th FYP. All roads are now in a periodic maintenance cycle. The average cost per km both \nfor resurfacing and routine maintenance has been increased to ensure better quality through \nincreased mechanization. \n \n17.  The efficiency of the use of the maintenance budget has also improved. The productivity \nof the large national workforce for routine maintenance has been improved during the 9th FYP \nfrom 1 km per person to 1.5 km per person through scheduled retirements, a freeze on new \nrecruitment, and increasing mechanization. A recent DoR initiative includes the introduction of \nperformance-based contracts in routine maintenance for a batch of road sections to a group of \nroad workers. The DoR continues to improve the road asset management systems for optimal \nallocation of the budget. The construction industry\u2019s experience with mechanized roadworks is \nincreasing as the volume of works increases. These actions demonstrate the Government\u2019s \nincreased commitment to maintenance and the increased efficiency of road maintenance works. \n \n18.  Taking into account the past budgetary provision and the trend, the Government is \nassessed as being able to adequately provide maintenance financing in a sustainable manner. \nIncreased  maintenance  quality  and  productivity  due  to  increased  mechanization,  quality \nassurance  systems,  the  recent  introduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  routine \nmaintenance, and more adoption of EFRC techniques and appropriate road technologies, will \nalso increase the efficiency of maintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. The \nGovernment has given assurances that it will provide adequate financing to maintain roads \ndeveloped under Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \n \nc.  Construction Quality \n \n19.  Construction quality is a critical element for sustainable operation and management, and \nachieving it requires strengthening the capacity of both the Government and the private sector \nin quality assurance and control. The Government mandates the DoR to review design for all \nroads, including farm roads, which will enhance the quality of roads at all levels. Considerations \nwould also require the use of appropriate design and technology for building roads in the \ncontext of Bhutan, including traffic, weather, and soil conditions. Simple, low-cost methods are \noften more appropriate and effective in terms of construction speed, quality, and environmental \nconsideration, e.g., use of natural gravel, etc. The proposed Project will consider design and \ntechnology for simple, low-cost methods as appropriate. \n \n20.  The Standards and Quality Control Authority (SQCA) under the Ministry of Works and \nHuman Settlement is responsible for improving quality assurance. A technical specification was \nrenewed  and  published  in  February  2005,  incorporating  environmental  considerations.  All \nconstruction materials require certification by SQCA for use. The proposed attached TA project ", "  5 \nwill provide training in road technologies, which will help improve quality during the survey, \ndesign, and construction phases. \n \nd.  Construction Industry \n \n21.  With  limited  works  in  the  past,  the  local  construction  industry  has  little  capacity. \nHowever, local contractors have gained experience since the 8th FYP, and there has been \nfurther promotion of private sector participation under the 9th FYP. The amount of contracting \nout to the private sector has increased from Nu70 million under the 7th FYP (1992\u20131997) to \nNu1,027 million under the 8th FYP (1997\u20132002) and Nu3,806 million under the 9th FYP. The \ncontract awards under ADB's Road Improvement Project1 (Nu500 million) and Road Network \nProject2 (Nu1,232 million) greatly contributed to this increase. \n \n22.  The Construction Development Board (CDB) has a computerized registration system for \ncontractors and an interim mechanism for dispute resolution. The CDB will continue with these \nconstruction development services, research and technology development, and awareness of \nbest  practices. Training  provided  under  the  attached  TA  project  could  be  open  to  private \ncontractors. \n \n23.  Under the 10th FYP, the DoR will coordinate all roadwork contracts to be outsourced to \nthe private sector. Regional and internationally accredited engineering and construction firms \nwill also be encouraged to participate, in joint ventures with national construction firms where \nnecessary,  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  project  delivery.  Under  the  Project, \ninternational competitive bidding will be adopted. \n \ne.  Vehicle Pollution Control \n \n24.  To minimize pollution, the Government made a pollution control certificate for all vehicles \ncompulsory, and so all vehicles are required to have pollution checks. The RSTA encourages \nthe establishment of private sector pollution check centers, and there are two such centers so \nfar\u2014in Thimphu and Phuentsholing. The Government has continued to establish permanent \npollution check centers, but needs to establish more in major cities that are equipped with \nemission test machines.  \n \nf.  Overloading \n \n25.  Overloading is an emerging problem in Bhutan as the size of vehicles increases. It is \nalso  expected  that  overloaded  trucks  will  operate  on  the  major  national  highways  as  the \neconomy  grows. An  overloading  control program is  being set  up  with  initial  installation  of \nweighbridges at major border points such as Gelephu, Jongkhar, Phuentsholing, Samdrup and \nSamtse. Mobile weighbridges are available and more weighbridges will be installed in industrial \ntowns. An overloading penalty of Nu500 per ton is strictly enforced.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "6   \ng.  Road Safety \n \n26.  Bhutan  has  a  lower  accident  rate  compared  with  other  lower  and  middle-income \ncountries. However, the extent of underreporting of accidents, especially in rural areas, is not \nknown. Considering the high growth of the vehicle fleet, these positive statistics may not be \nsustained. \n \n27.  The Road Safety and Transport Regulation of 1999 provides regulations for registration \nand licensing, commercial passenger vehicles, traffic control, and enforcement mechanisms. \nMeasures have been taken to educate all drivers on basic safety precautions and many driving \nrefresher courses have been organized. Vehicle inspections have been conducted, including \npredeparture inspection for buses and inspection of all vehicles every year, except commercial \nvehicles for which inspection is conducted every half year. Awareness of the need to improve \nroad safety is increasing. High-risk accident areas are identified and reported to the DoR for \nfuture improvement. Road safety audits are undertaken under the Project. \n \n2.  External Assistance and ADB Strategy \n \n28.  The  development  of  the  road  network  has  depended  upon  external  assistance \n(Appendix 3). The main development agencies and governments active in the road sector are \nADB and the governments of Austria, India, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. \n \n29.  The  World  Bank  has  the  ongoing  Rural  Access  Project  II,  which  has  included \nconsiderable institutional support to the DoR. Some support is also provided for the farm road \nprogram through agricultural development projects from various sources such as the European \nUnion, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, the Government of India, International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development, JICA, and Swiss Development Cooperation. \n \n30.  ADB  continues  to have  dialogue with major financing  agencies in the  sector. ADB \nassistance has focused on resurfacing the East\u2013West Highway in the north and, since the First \nRoad  Network  Project  (RNP-I),  on  network  expansion.  JICA  focuses  on  bridges  and \nconstruction equipment and is now also considering support to roads; the World Bank focuses \non rural roads. For TA in the sector, bilateral funding agencies provide capacity building for \nengineering  aspects,  while  ADB  focuses  on  planning  and  policy  aspects,  and  on-the-job \ntechnical support. \n \n31.  ADB involvement in transport and communications has so far been exclusively in roads. \nSince 1983, within the sector ADB has provided four loans totaling about $52 million, seven \nadvisory TA projects totaling $3.66 million, and six project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) projects totaling $2.28 million. ADB assistance in the sector focuses on improving and \nexpanding the road network to provide better access to regional and domestic markets with \nsupport to capacity development. The assistance will continue to provide a number of benefits \nthrough the following strategic sector objectives as per the country strategy and program (2006\u2013\n2010):3 (i) continue to enhance the main road network, (ii) ensure adequate maintenance of the \nexisting road network is carried out, (iii) improve rural accessibility, (iv) support institutional \nstrengthening,  (v)  promote  private  sector  participation,  (vi)  improve  road  technology  and \nproductivity,  and  (vii)  support  subregional  links.  ADB's  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation \nStrategy  and  Program4 for  2006\u20132008  supports  activities  in  improving  regional  transport \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2005.

Lessons  \n \n32.  ADB-assisted  road  projects  in  Bhutan  have  experienced  delays,  which  are  mostly \nattributable to (i) government procedures, especially relating to environmental clearances; (ii) \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures and practices; and (iii) lack of capacity of the private sector in \nroad construction and engineering and related services. With the ongoing RNP-I, delay in \nimplementation was caused mainly by a delay in recruitment of consultants and in the land \nacquisition process. The progress of construction is generally acceptable. \n \n33.  The main weaknesses in project execution relate to design finalization, procurement, \nand land acquisition. The DoR has increased the number of engineers, especially in survey and \ndesign areas, and there is a need for further increases in terms of the number of engineers and \nlevels of skills and knowledge. For safeguard implementation, the DoR has strengthened its \ncapacity to satisfy interministerial procedures, such as environmental clearance, and increased \nits familiarity with ADB procurement procedures. During the regional workshop, representatives \nfrom dzongkhags with project roads were invited for discussions to expedite land acquisition \nprocesses. For procurement, the DoR has been exposed to ADB procurement procedures \nthrough several ADB projects. Private sector contractors have also gained experience through \nmore works of a larger size. The DoR has taken initiatives to improve the speed and quality of \ncompletion of construction works, including regular monitoring of project progress. \n \n34.  Under the Project, the DoR will outsource design works to international engineering \nconsultants, who will provide procurement support including finalizing bidding documents. On \nsafeguard aspects, while dzongkhags are competent authorities for land acquisition, the DoR \nhas offered support such as surveys. The social and resettlement specialist, who will be part of \nthe team of the design and supervision consultants, will also provide training to the DoR and \ndzongkhag officers to familiarize them with ADB policies and requirements, thus improving the \nGovernment's capacity in safeguard implementation. The attached TA project will enhance the \nDoR's capacity in the planning and engineering of roads using modern technologies.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n35.  The Project will promote industrial development in the southern areas of the country, \nwhich is remote and has high poverty incidence but high agricultural and industrial development \npotential.  The  Project  will  integrate  the  southern  areas  more  effectively  with  their  primary \nmarkets, increasing regional trade, through increased passenger and freight transport within the \ncountry and with India. The Project will open up high-potential areas of Bhutan to the regional \ntransport and distribution system, promoting mutual economic growth and poverty reduction to \nBhutan and other South Asian countries through more economic opportunities with India and \naccess to job opportunities and markets. It will also expand the road transport network in the \nsouthern region, providing a major internal transit route for Bhutanese passengers and goods, \ni.e., an alternative to the existing east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part \nof the country. \n \n \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Outputs \n \n36.  Investment  Component. The Project will upgrade or construct five critical sections \n(about 180 km) of the southern east\u2013west highway: (i) Manitar\u2013Raidak (37 km, upgrading to a \nnational  highway),  providing  access  to  the  border crossing  at  Lhamoizingkha;  (ii)  Raidak\u2013\nLhamoizingkha (25 km,  constructing a  national  highway);  (iii) Panbang\u2013Nganglam  (36 km, \nconstructing a national highway), providing access to the border crossing at Nganglam; (iv) \nTsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Durung  Ri  (62  km,  constructing  a  feeder  road);  and  (v)  Samdrupcholing\u2013\nSamrang (23 km, constructing a national highway), providing access to the border crossing at \nSamdrup Jongkhar. Consulting services will be provided to prepare detailed design and support \nimplementation of the civil works. Road improvement and construction works under the Project \ninclude constructing roadways including longitudinal drainage structures, installing culverts and \nbridges, constructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures, and structures for resettlement \nand rehabilitation of project affected people (Appendix 4). \n \n37.  Capacity Building Component. The Project will also provide equipment necessary for \nthe Government to enhance sector capacity such as quality control, survey and design, and \ncontrol of overloading and vehicle emissions. Major equipment includes laboratory equipment, \nsurvey and design equipment and software, vehicle emission and fitness testing equipment, and \nweighbridges. TA will be attached to the grant to support DoR capacity building, including \nincreased knowledge of and skills in road technologies for survey, design, and construction, \nespecially on EFRC methods. Support to road asset management will be continued for systems \nupdate  and  enhancement.  The  consultants  will  identify  the  specifications  and  timing  of \nequipment required during the TA implementation. Consulting services under detailed design \nand  construction  supervision  will  provide  on-the-job  technical  inputs  and  training  during \nimplementation, especially on EFRC. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n38.  Environmental  Considerations  and  Appropriate  Technologies  in  Design  and \nConstruction. The DoR has adopted EFRC techniques in its design standard and construction. \nThe methodology adopted for environmental consideration will minimize damage to the natural \nenvironment  by  use  of  controlled  blasting,  limited  use  of  bulldozers  (excavator-tipper \ncombinations are used instead), use of log and boulder barriers to control slipping of blasted or \nexcavated materials, and incorporation of bioengineering techniques for slope protection. The \nlatest road technical specifications for roads and bridges published in February 2005 adopt \nthese  methods.  Also,  simple,  low-cost  methods  are  appropriately  adopted  for  improving \nconstruction speed, quality, and environmental consideration, e.g., the use of natural gravel, etc. \nThe Project will adopt these methods for all road sections. \n \n39.  Community Participation in Alignment Selection. During project preparation, field \nstudies were conducted by using household surveys, focus group discussions, village profile \nsurveys, consultations with other stakeholders both on-site and at headquarters in Thimphu, \nand workshops at which findings were discussed and roads and preliminary alignments were \ndetermined. The proposed alignment was decided through public consultation with communities \nand consideration of the assessment of economics and technical, social, and environmental \naspects. Any changes to the alignment will be minimal at the time of detailed engineering \nstudies due to full consultation with communities. \n \n ", "  9 \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n40.

It is proposed that ADB provides a grant of $38.76 million equivalent from its Special \nFunds resources, inclusive of a $10.00 million grant from the subregional pool of the ADF and \nan $8.76 million grant from additional ADF liquidity. The Government will finance the remaining \nlocal cost of $15.56 million equivalent, or 28.6% of the total cost, including taxes and duties, \nland  acquisition,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  other \nmiscellaneous costs (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  38.76    71.4 \nGovernment  15.56    28.6 \n  Total    54.32    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n42.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n43.  The organization chart for project implementation is provided in Appendix 6. The DoR \nwill be the executing agency. The project management office (PMO) will be established and \nheaded by a full time project coordinator at the executive engineer level. The PMO will be \nresponsible for (i) the overall coordination, management and monitoring of the Project, (ii) \nsupervision of the detailed engineering design and (iii) procurement. The DoR may, as required, \norganize meetings of related agencies of the Government to facilitate swift resolution of any \nimplementation-related issues requiring coordination amongst various departments.  \n  \n44.  In  addition  to  the  PMO,  two  site  offices  will  be  established  to  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring day-to-day implementation of the Project and preparation of project progress reports, \neach to be headed by a project manager at the assistant engineer level. \n \n45.  Procurement and contract awards will be the responsibility of the PMO. Each regional \noffice will be responsible for (i) monitoring the progress of day-to-day project implementation, \nand (ii) preparing project progress reports. The project coordinator will consolidate these reports \nand  submit  them  to  the  DoR  and  ADB,  and  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  withdrawal \napplications. The project coordinator and all project managers will meet on a quarterly basis or \nas required. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years inclusive of preconstruction activities, and \ntaking into account the time required for preparing detailed design, bidding documents, and \nprocurement. Civil works are expected to commence around January 2011 and be completed in \nDecember 2014. The implementation schedule is included in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n47.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts \nwill be undertaken in 10 contract packages (Appendix 8). All these contracts are estimated at \nmore than $1 million and will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures \nwith domestic margin of preference. ADB is currently updating the list of countries eligible for \ndomestic preference, which will be issued shortly. If Bhutan is not on the updated list of eligible \ncountries at the time of bidding, the domestic preference referred to elsewhere in this report will \nnot be applicable to this Project. The civil works contracts have been packaged to encourage \nboth  international  and  national  bidders  to  participate  for  development  of  the  domestic \nconstruction industry.  The indicative  contract  packages  are in  Appendix 8. Bidders will  be \npostqualified by applying a single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. Award of contracts \nwill require prior review and approval by ADB. \n ", " 11 \n48.  Equipment financed under the Project will be worth $1 million under the capacity building \ncomponent,  and  will  be  procured  using international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  the \nestimated contract is more than $500,000, using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nif the estimated contract is between $100,000 and $500,000, and shopping if the estimated \ncontract amount is less than $100,000. Contract packaging for equipment will be based on \nrequired technical features and timing of procurement. The TA consultants engaged under the \nattached TA will identify the packages during TA implementation. The procurement plan is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n49.  The NCB  annex  summarizes necessary modifications to  or clarification  of Bhutan\u2019s \nprocurement procedures to carry out NCB for ADB-financed projects. NCB will be used for \ncontracts with an estimated value of less than $1 million and in cases where it is deemed more \nexpeditious than international competitive bidding. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  Two  international  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  for  (i)  detailed  design  and \nprocurement assistance, and (ii) construction supervision of civil works under the Project. The \nDoR will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n51.  For  preparing  detailed  design  and  bidding  documents  and  helping  the  DoR  with \nprocurement, an international consulting firm, in association with a national firm and/or individual \nconsultants, will be recruited. The consulting inputs of the consultants will be 34 international \nperson-months  and  32  national  person-months.  The  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  have  been \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix C). The DoR has proposed to select the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) consultant as the detailed design and procurement assistance \nconsultant through single source selection, which is a justifiable request because the PPTA \nconsultants (i) have a clear advantage due to the highly unique topographic and geotechnical \nconditions of project roads, thereby limiting competition; (ii) do not require preparatory work, \nthereby  saving  costs; (iii)  have  demonstrated  qualifications  and  experience  through  strong \nperformance during the PPTA; and (iv) did not prepare the TOR for the subsequent project \npackage on design and procurement assistance, thereby confirming absence of conflict of \ninterest (refer to Attachment 1 of Appendix 9). If selected, key personnel of the PPTA team, \nincluding the team leader, the deputy team leader, and the current national specialists on \nenvironment  and  resettlement/social  issues,  will  be  retained  for  design  and  procurement \nassistance. \n \n52.  For construction supervision, an international consulting firm in association with national \nconsultants  and/or  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited.  The  TOR  have  been  prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix D). An estimated 28 person-months of international and 604 person-\nmonths of national consulting inputs will be provided. The international consultants will also \nprovide on-the-job training to counterpart staff and national consultants, especially on EFRC \nimplementation. The consultant will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (with full technical proposal). \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n53.  ADB approved advance contracting of civil works and provided in-principle agreement \nfor retroactive financing in July 2009. Up to 20% of the grant proceeds will be eligible for \nretroactive  financing,  provided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and \n ", "12  \nconsulting services for the Project in accordance with agreed procedures and during the 12 \nmonths before the signing of the grant agreement. The Government has been informed that \napproval of advance contracting and in-principle approval of retroactive financing does not in \nany way commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n54.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  DoR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the DoR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n55.  The contracting regime is transparent, and open tendering is conducted in accordance \nwith  the  Financial  Manual  (1988)6,  which  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance.  This  was \nenhanced through a series of modifications as the Procurement Rules and Regulations 20097 \nalong with standardization of bidding documents of works and goods, and request for proposal \nfor recruiting consulting services. The Royal Audit Authority undertakes a periodic audit of \naccounts  and  statements  as  part  of  its  mandate  on  performance  audits  of  government \nministries. The Public Finance Act was enacted in 2007 to regulate the financial management of \nthe  Government  in  order  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  public  resources, \nstrengthen accountability, and provide statutory authority and control for sound and sustainable \nfiscal policy. In respect of anticorruption measures, the Royal Audit Authority undertakes a \nprogram of workshops to (i) increase awareness of public officials and the general public of \nissues surrounding corruption, and (ii) promote discussions on current policies and guidelines. \n \n56.  The  Project  is  the  second  project  of  a  similar  nature.  The  financial  management \narrangements for the project will remain the same as they were for the RNP-I. The Government \nis familiar with managing external funds, as well as utilizing, accounting, and reporting for the \nsame. \n \n57.  The DoR will disclose information on the progress of the project to the public by making \ntimely updates on its website. The DoR has separated its mechanical division into a separate \ncorporate entity (CDC), which will help increase competition among contractors, and hence \nincrease quality and reduce cost. To enhance overall road sector management, part of the \nattached TA project will provide capacity strengthening of the DoR in asset management, which \nwill  improve  governance  of  road  administration  and  accountability.  For  the  Project,  ADB \nprocurement procedures using international competitive bidding will enhance transparency and \nfair competition, and ADB disbursement procedures and FIDIC8-based contract management \nwill mitigate corruption problems during implementation. \n \n                                                \n6  Royal Government of Bhutan. 1998.

Disbursement Arrangements \n \n58.  Grant disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment, reimbursement, and imprest account \nprocedures will be used for civil works, consulting services, and equipment. An imprest account \nfor RNP-II will be established at the Royal Monetary Authority, and the initial and maximum \namount to be deposited in the imprest account shall not exceed 10% of the grant amount or the \nequivalent  of  6  months  estimated  expenditure  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account, \nwhichever is lower. The DoR will be responsible for monitoring this account, including monthly \nreconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  preparation  of  the  withdrawal  applications  for \nliquidation/replenishment  of  the  account.  To  expedite  disbursement  during  implementation, \nstatement of expenditure (SOE) will be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish the imprest \naccount for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000, which may be \nreviewed and increased to $100,000 based on experience of the new project team and its \ncapacity to manage SOE. The project coordinator will ensure timely processing of payment \nrequests from the contractors and will ensure that the PMO processes and forwards each \npayment request within 5 days of receipt of such requests to the Ministry of Finance for release \nof funds.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n59.  The DOR will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand services financed from the grant proceeds, the expenditure incurred, and the use of local \nfunds under the Project. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples. These project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit \nreport will include the audit of the SOE procedures, and will specifically include a separate audit \nopinion on the use of grant proceeds and compliance with SOE procedures. The imprest \naccount and SOE will be audited as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the \nexamination of the imprest account and SOE will be separate in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n60.  The audited reports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year, taking into account the geographical and logistical \ndifficulties in completing the auditing within 6 months. The request from the Government for a 9-\nmonth period for completing and submitting reports of audits carried out on the project activities \ncan be considered justified considering that Project roads are scattered from the west to the \neast with difficult access, and contracts will be managed by the PMO and two site offices which \nare also scattered to facilitate close management of project roads. This will mean that the PMO \nwill require more time for checking submissions by site offices. Under the ongoing project (RNP-\nI), the time allowed for submission of audited project accounts to ADB is 9 months following the \nend of the fiscal year based on weak capacity of the country's auditing systems. Of the two \nactual submissions so far, one was delayed by 2.6 months beyond the 9 months and the other \nwas submitted 1.5 months in advance, which is still 7.5 months from the end of the fiscal year. \n \n61.  The  DoR  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  Project  quarterly  progress  reports  on \nprogress made during the period of review, changes if any to the implementation schedule, \nproblems or difficulties encountered and remedial actions taken, anticipated problems and the \nproposed remedial measures, and work to be undertaken in the following period. The DoR will \nsubmit the quarterly progress reports to ADB within 45 days from the close of each quarter. \nThese reports will also include a summary financial account for each subproject, expenditure to \n ", "14  \ndate,  report  on  performance  monitoring,  and  the  results  of  monitoring  of  the  social  and \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n62.  The DoR will prepare and provide ADB with a road completion report within 3 months of \nphysical completion of each individual road, and a Project completion report within 3 months of \ncompletion of transactions under the Project. These reports will cover a detailed evaluation of \neach  road  project  and  the  overall  project  covering  the  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and \nconsultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, and other \ndetails relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n63.  The  DoR  will,  within  3  months  of  the  grant  signing,  develop  a  systematic  project \nperformance monitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, for use throughout \nthe life of the Project. \n \n64.  The DoR will establish, within 3 months of the effective date of the grant, a baseline for \nperformance indicators to be used for monitoring implementation of each road project. It will \nthereafter conduct evaluation surveys annually under each road project, in accordance with the \nproject performance monitoring system, to evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, \nprogress, and achievements of objectives of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n65.  ADB and DoR will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures required to be undertaken \ntowards achieving the objectives of the subprojects and the Project. A midterm review of the \nProject will be undertaken by ADB and DoR in 2012. The midterm review will focus on issues \nrelated to implementation arrangements, and agree on changes, if needed, to achieve the \nobjective of the Project. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n66.  The TA of $400,000 for Capacity Building of the Department of Roads will cover part of \nthe Government\u2019s initiatives to strengthen DoR capacity in road technologies and road asset \nmanagement to ensure the quality of road construction. The focus of the TA will be to equip \nDoR officials with knowledge of and skills in the road technologies of survey, design, and \nconstruction, especially with environmental considerations. Support to road asset management \nwill be continued with focus on guiding DoR officials in the optimal use of the road asset \nmanagement systems and application of computerized systems in applicable roads. \n \n67.  The  consultants  will  undertake  the  services  in  close  consultation  with  the  director \ngeneral of the DoR. Other agencies such as SQCA, CDC, CDB, and Construction Association \nof Bhutan will also participate in training and workshops. The consultants will also conduct \ntraining and workshops in the field and nationally as required. \n \n68.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program (Technical \nAssistance Special Fund-IV), and be carried out by an international consulting firm, to be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The TA will be implemented for 6 months from December 2009 to May 2010. ", " 15 \nInternational inputs of about 13 person-months are required. Terms of reference for the TA are \nin Appendix 10. \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Technical Aspects \n \n69.  Various measures suitable to Bhutanese  conditions  are incorporated in  the  design, \nespecially  environmental  considerations  in  design  and  construction,  e.g.,  bioengineering  in \nslope  protection,  controlled  blasting,  and appropriate  technologies. Overall, the Project will \ndevelop quality roads (thereby substantially improving transport efficiency), speed up traffic, \nimprove travel conditions, and reduce journey time and vehicle operating costs (VOCs). \n \nB.  Institutional and Operational Improvements \n \n70.  Improving  management  of  the  Bhutan  road  network  through  the  capacity  building \ncomponent and the TA, and the expansion of the road network under the Project, will enhance \noverall road conditions and usability, thus increasing the travel speeds and reducing travel time, \naccidents, overloading, and hence subregional traffic. The enhancement of the DoR\u2019s capacity \nin construction quality and road asset management will improve sustainability of roads and \nefficiency  of  road  maintenance,  leading  to  better  governance  in  road  administration  and \naccountability  creating  an  environment  encouraging  efficiency  within  the  DoR  and  the \nconstruction industry. This will ensure that road asset development and management is more \nefficient, and construction and maintenance is of higher quality, resulting in decreased recurrent \ncosts over the medium and long term. This will add to the overall level of social and economic \ndevelopment in Bhutan. \n \nC.  Economic Assessment \n \n71.  The economic assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.9 The highway design and maintenance model was used to \ncalculate VOCs and time costs with modification for conditions in Bhutan. The principal benefits \nare VOCs savings and travel time savings. Additional benefits to the population in project-\naffected areas have been added: (i) savings in VOCs and time due to improved passenger and \nfreight transport, (ii) benefits of traffic generated by increased consumption and production due \nto better access, (ii) reduced loss of perishable goods are also added as part of the exogenous \nbenefits of the model, and (iv) VOC savings for the traffic diverted from other routes due to \nshortened project roads. \n \n72.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the roads evaluated varied between 16% \nand 24%. The Project as a whole and by the individual road is robust. This is mainly due to the \nleast-cost approach, such as reducing the formation width and use of gravel for those roads \nhaving limited traffic. \n \n73.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increase by 20%, (ii) benefits decrease by 20%, (iii) a combination of the first \ntwo cases, (iv) a construction delay of 1 year, and (v) a 50% reduction to the highest benefit \n                                                \n9  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "16  \ncategory. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity \ntests. Only one road has an EIRR slightly below 12% in the worst-case scenario. The roads \nserve one of the most undeveloped areas of the country, and their improvement will have a \npositive impact on the development of these areas. Considering their positive development \nimpact and the fact that even in the worst-case scenario, they have an EIRR of more than 10%, \nthe roads are recommended for implementation under the Project along with all other roads \nincluded in the analysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nD.  Financial Sustainability \n \n74.  Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are estimated to be 14% of the \ncurrent DoR maintenance budget and 2% of the overall DoR budget on an annual basis. The \nmaintenance  will  be  required  after project  completion in 2014 and  the appropriate budget \nincrease is expected, considering the trend in past years. It is reasonable to expect that funds \nwill be available to meet these costs. \n \nE.  Social Impacts \n \n75.  Livelihood and Poverty Reduction. Remoteness and isolation are the major causes of \npoverty in Bhutan. The construction of national highways and feeder roads covering 183.0 km \n(Manitar\u2013Raidak, 37.0 km; Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha, 25.0 km; Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong, 36.0 \nkm; Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang, 23.0 km; and Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Shingchungri, 62.0 km) will have \ndirect benefits for the local population (poor and vulnerable groups and households headed by \nwomen).  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  bring  new  economic \nopportunities to the remote areas of the country. It is also expected to increase economic \nactivity  (particularly  in  small  retail)  at  the  roadsides  and  increased  accessibility  due  to \nconstruction of access roads connected to the main roads.  \n \n76.  The socioeconomic impacts of the Project will be positive in terms of access to health \ncare facilities and education, improved communication facilities, easy transportation of cash \ncrops, and vibrant growth of economic activities in rural villages. Rural electrification is also \nexpected to improve once road connectivity is established. This will permit students to study for \nlonger hours in the evening, and contribute to a cleaner living environment through the use of \nelectricity and gas for cooking, thus saving the forests from further degradation. \n \n77.  The income-generation activities of the population of the immediate and wider project \ninfluence areas are expected to increase through sales of local produce at the road sites almost \non a daily basis. As a result, the Project will significantly reduce the poverty level and improve \nthe  quality  of  life  in  the  five  beneficiary  dzongkhags  (districts)\u2014Chhukha,  Dagana, \nPemagatshel, Samdrupjongkhar and Zhemgang\u2014through connectivity of these remote rural \nareas. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \n78.  Gender. Gender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by \nundertaking a process of gender analysis to assess the impact of the Project. Sixteen focus \ngroup discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups \nsuch  as  high  income,  poor  people,  and  women  belonging  to  different  ethnicities.  These \ndiscussions revealed that the majority of the women felt that the roads will benefit them as they \nwill be able to transport their yield to market and this will help increase their income. The study \nrevealed no significant discrimination against women in Bhutan. The socioeconomic survey \nshowed that, although some activities may be predominantly undertaken by either women or \nmen, women and men traditionally have equal status for most socioeconomic activities. The ", " 17 \nstudies also revealed that rural women are becoming more visible in both household and other \nactivities, and women are frequently taking on additional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle \nfor their families. Along with men in the project areas, women will benefit from (i) easier access \nto external markets, (ii) increased local retailing opportunities, and (iii) easier access to health \ncare  centers  and  education  facilities.  Women  may  also  benefit  more  than  men  from  the \nincreased access to schools. Traditionally, enrolment rates in schools have been lower for girls \nthan for boys. \n79.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People. To assess the Project resettlement \nimpacts, a census survey based on preliminary road designs was undertaken from February to \nApril 2009. For the five roads proposed for construction (national and feeder), 125.89 acres of \nprivate land (107.59 acres of dry land and 18.3 acres of wet land) are going to be affected. All \nthe land to be acquired is privately owned. There are 279 affected households in total for all the \nroads.  Eighty  six  affected  structures  are  mainly  permanent  houses,  temporary  sheds, \ncowsheds, toilets, water tanks, and water taps. There are also mud irrigation channels that are \ncommunity-owned and will require restoration. \n \n80.  Five separate short resettlement plans have been prepared to mitigate and address all \nthese  and  associated  losses.  These  resettlement  plans  were  developed  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and Government Land Act 1979 (amended in 2007). \nComplete details of compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, shifting assistance, \nand  other  income  restoration  assistance  are  provided  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the \nresettlement plans. Additional support provisions for affected people belonging to vulnerable \ngroups are included in the resettlement plans. No impact on indigenous people is envisaged. \nThe total cost for resettlement is estimated at $1.23 million (Nu63,965,384). A summary of the \nresettlement plans is in Supplementary Appendix A.   \n81.  AIDS  and Human  Trafficking. The Government has the 15-year National Sexually \nTransmitted Disease/AIDS Control Program. This is a multisector initiative involving all sections \nof society in Bhutan since 1988, assisted by bilateral development agencies, United Nations \nagencies, and  a World Bank grant.10 The  Government  has  been  successfully carrying out \nawareness campaigns and free health care to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS in various parts \nof the country. The social assessments undertaken have not revealed any significant risks of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. However, the DoR will ensure that all civil works contractors \ndisseminate information at work sites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS for \nthose employed during construction. Contracts for all subprojects will include specific clauses on \nthese undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by the DoR, with the support of \nsupervision consultants during project implementation. \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n \n82.  The Project has been classified as category A under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) \nas some of the road segments fall inside environmentally sensitive areas. Of the five road \nsegments,  the  Panbang\u2013Nganglam  road  falls  inside  the  buffer  zone  of  the  Royal  Manas \nNational Park for most of its 36 km length, and approximately 7 km of the Samdrupcholing\u2013\nSamrang  road  falls  inside  the  Khaling  Wildlife  Sanctuary.  In  addition  to  these  two,  road \nsegments  along  the  Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha  road  fall  inside  habitat  of  important  wildlife \n                                                \n10  World Bank. 2004. Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant in the Amount of SDR 4.0 million (US$5.77 \nmillion equivalent) to the Kingdom of Bhutan for an HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Control Project. Washington \nD.C.   \n ", "18  \nspecies\u2014elephant (Elephus maximus) and gaur (Bos gaurus). Both these species are listed as \nendangered  and  vulnerable  under  the  IUCN11 list  and  under  Schedule  I  (totally  protected \nspecies) of the Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995. In addition, the Forest and \nNature  Conservation  Act  requires  the  preparation  of  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) for projects that fall inside or in the buffer zone of protected areas. An EIA \nhas been prepared for this project and the summary EIA (Supplementary Appendix B) was \ncirculated to the Board. \n \n83.  Anticipated environmental impacts under the Project include impacts on (i) the physical \nenvironment such as air, soil, and water; (ii) the biological environment, such as vegetation and \nwildlife; and (iii) the socioeconomic environment, such as land acquisition and resettlement, \nlabor  conditions,  and  damage  to  local  infrastructure.  Most  of  the  impacts  are  short  term, \nreversible, and confined to the construction stage of the Project. Most of the impacts can be \nminimized  and  addressed  through  mitigation  measures  that  have  been  included  in  the \nengineering design and the environmental management plan (EMP), which follow the principles \nof environmentally friendly road construction advocated by the Department of Roads. Hence, all \nnecessary mitigation costs have already been included in the engineering works.  \n \n84.  Removal of approximately 100 hectares (ha) of vegetation including 21,000 trees with a \ndiameter  breast  height  (dbh)  that  is  greater  than  0.9  meter  are  potential  permanent  and \nirreversible  impacts. However,  necessary  measures  will  be  implemented  to revegetate  the \nnewly cut slopes and areas and a compensatory tree plantation program along with a lump-sum \nbudget amount have been included in the EMP to recover the lost trees. Disturbance to wildlife \nhabitat and obstruction of the wildlife movement paths, particularly of elephant and gaur, from \nthe Indian plains in the south into the foothills of Bhutan in the north are the most significant \nimpacts  anticipated  from  the  Project.  Discussions  have  been  carried  out  with  the  Nature \nConservation Division of the Department of Forests, and the department has agreed to provide \ntechnical support for ensuring the development of road design and structures that will allow the \ncontinuation of the wildlife movement. \n \n85.  Both the EMP and engineering costs will be further updated after the detailed design \nstudies have been carried out. An environment specialist will be engaged to ensure that all \nproposed measures are taken to minimize or mitigate negative impacts during the preparation of \nthe detailed design. Significant changes in the EIA and EMP due to significant changes in the \nProject will warrant resubmission of the EIA report to government agencies of Bhutan and ADB \nfor approval. \n \nG.  Project Risks \n \n86.  The risk of delayed implementation will be mitigated through (i) the DoR\u2019s advance \nactions and ADB's prior review of procurement, (ii) more hands-on advice during procurement \nprocesses,  and  (iii)  more  awareness  of  ADB  safeguard  requirements  by  the  DoR  and \ndzongkhag officials. ADB prior review will facilitate the approval process of bid evaluation. \nHands-on support will be provided by the consultant under the Project. Training in safeguard \nrequirements  will  be  provided  to  the  DoR  and  dzongkhag  officials  by  environment  and \nresettlement specialists under the design and construction supervision consultants to mitigate \ndelays  due  to  procedural  clearance. The  DoR  will  provide  required  support  to  dzongkhag \noffices, such as survey teams to facilitate land acquisition.  \n \n                                                \n11  International Union for Conservation of Nature ", " 19 \n87.  The country assistance program evaluation for Bhutan12 indicated a risk of ad hoc design \nchanges, which could result in realignment, leading to implementation delay. This risk has been \nminimized  with  full  consultation  with  local  communities  and  dzongkhag  officials.  Technical \nadvice will be provided by the consultant under the attached TA and design and supervision \nconsultants on appropriate technologies with environment considerations, which will ensure \ntimely implementation of high-quality projects. \n \n88.  The risk of inadequate maintenance financing is mitigated through TA for continued \nsupport to asset management planning. Sufficient budget was allocated to the targeted length \nunder the 9th FYP and the Government has provided for increased cost per km and increased \ntarget length under the 10th FYP. \n \n89.  As the country program evaluation and project performance audit report suggest, the TA \nis designed to reflect local conditions, develop simpler practical systems, and make consultants \ninput more DoR-oriented, by providing DoR staff with specific tasks to be completed with \nminimal inputs given by international consultants for overall guidance. \n \n90.  Fiduciary risks are addressed by adopting international best practices in procurement \nwith ADB prior review. This is a repeat project. The Ministry of Finance and the DoR have been \nexposed to ADB requirements and are fully aware of procedures. A discrepancy was recently \nidentified in the computation method under the ongoing RNP-I. The issue has been discussed \nand resolved, and hence no more issues are envisaged. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n91.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the DoR have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n92.  Road  Maintenance  Financing.  The  Government  will  provide  sufficient  and  timely \nbudget for routine and periodic maintenance of the entire road network every year throughout \nproject implementation. \n  \n93.  Counterpart Funds. The Government will ensure the timely and adequate provision of \nall counterpart funds for the Project. \n \n94.  Road Safety. The Government will ensure that road safety measures are implemented, \ntaking into account findings and recommendations of the PPTA and design and supervision \nconsultants. \n \n95.  Overloading. The Government will ensure that all prevailing regulations on overloading \ncontrol,  including  penalties,  will  be  effectively  implemented,  including  by  further  installing \noverweigh bridges. \n \n96.  Health. The Government and the DoR will ensure that contractors provide adequately \nfor health and safety. Bidding documents will include measures on how contractors will address \nthis, including an information and awareness raising campaign for construction workers on \nsexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2005. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Bhutan. Manila. \n ", "20  \n \n97.  Labor. The Government and the DoR will ensure that civil works contractors comply with \nall  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and \nmaintenance activities, and provide appropriate facilities for women and children in construction \ncampsites. People directly affected by the Project will be given priority to be employed by the \nProject. Contractors will not differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal \nvalue. A specific clause ensuring this will be included in bidding documents. The DoR will \ncooperate with the Department of Labor to monitor the implementation of this clause. \n \n98.  Environmental Consideration. The Government will implement all mitigation measures \nincluded in the EIA reports in accordance with the Royal Bhutan Environmental Policy as well as \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy. The DoR will consult on a continuing basis with the park managers \nof the nearby national parks on the locations for construction campsites, hot mix and crushing \nplants, and disposal and handling of spoiled materials. The DoR will incorporate the EIA reports \nincluding  the  EMP  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts,  and  are  updated,  if \nnecessary, in the course of Project implementation with prior approval of ADB ensure that \ncontractors will implement the required mitigation measures and EMP as described in these \nreports.  The  DoR  shall  ensure  that  all  conditions  attached  to  these  clearances  will  be \nimplemented and monitored. The DoR will promptly mitigate and minimize any adverse impact \non the environment that may arise from the Project implementation in accordance with the EMP. \nThe DoR will undertake an environmental monitoring plan and submit semiannual reports to \nADB and agencies on the implementation of the EMP as part of the progress report on Project \nimplementation. The Government will report to ADB any change in alignment or to project \ncomponents since the environmental assessment report was approved to allow a consideration \non whether additional environmental assessment study is required. \n \n99.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Government will (i) implement the Project in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plans  prepared,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples (2006) and applicable national laws and regulations; (ii) in \ncase of any design changes in project roads, ensure that the resettlement plans are updated on \nthe basis of the final alignment and submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to awarding \nof civil works contracts; and (iii) provide semiannual progress reports on the implementation of \nthe resettlement plans. \n \n \nB.  Conditions for Award of Contracts \n \n100.  The Government will not award civil works contract unless the following requirements \nhave been met:  \n \n(i)  During  the  detailed  design  phase  of  the  Project,  the  DoR  will  update  the \nresettlement plans  and  the EMP  as required. If the  scope  of the Project  is \nsubstantially changed, the resettlement plans will be revised accordingly and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before award of any civil works contract. Any \nchanges to the EMP will be reviewed, recorded, and submitted to the National \nEnvironment Commission as well as to ADB for review and concurrence as \nrequired prior to awarding of civil works contracts.  \n(ii)  The  DoR  will  have  obtained  the  environmental  clearance  from  the  National \nEnvironment Commission for the purposes of the contract. \n ", " 21 \nC.  Conditions for Commencement of Civil Works \n \n101.  The DoR will not commence civil works unless it has acquired, paid compensation for, \nand made available the land and rights in land free from any encumbrances, and cleared any \nobstruction  from  the  related  section  required  to  be  handed  over  to  the  contractor  for \ncommencement of construction in accordance with the work schedule under the related civil \nworks contract. \n \nVII.

Introduction \n \n1.  Transport and communications contributed 11.3% to overall gross domestic product in \n2007. Road transport is the only internal transport mode in Bhutan, other than a few ropeways. \nThe country has no domestic flights, no railways, and no navigable rivers. However, many areas \nare not accessible by road and are served only by an extensive network of mule tracks which \nexists throughout the country. The census survey in 2005 indicates that 9.7% of the population \nlives more than 6 hours away from the nearest road and that the rural households in six districts \ncomprise 73% of this percentage. Only one airport provides limited air access to the rest of the \nworld. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) involvement in transport and communications so far \nhas been only in the road sector. \n \n2.  The Government's 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2008\u20132013) objectives for roads and \nbridges are (i) providing road access to all gewog (town) centers; (ii) reducing poverty incidence \nand improving the quality of life of the rural population through enhanced rural accessibility; (iii) \nenhancing national security and solidarity through an improved/expanded road network; (iv) \nenhancing road connectivity to facilitate accelerated hydropower development; (v) consolidating \nenvironmentally friendly construction practices to minimize impacts on the environment; (vi) \nenhancing reliability, economy, safety, ease, and comfort of road travel through reducing travel \ntime, road user costs, transportation costs of goods and services, and traffic accidents; (vii) \npromoting  and  enhancing  private  sector  participation  in  delivery  of  construction  and \nmaintenance  of  road  and  bridge  infrastructure;  and  (viii)  building  professionalism  and \nengineering capacity in the areas of planning, design, monitoring, quality control, and cost-\neffective  construction  of  road  and  bridge  infrastructure  works.  The  overall  budget  of  the \nDepartment of Roads (DoR) under the 10th FYP is Nu13,708 million for (i) road construction, \nincluding feeder roads (Nu6,438 million); (ii) road improvement, including realignment (Nu4,569 \nmillion); (iii) road resurfacing (Nu1,389 million); (iv) routine maintenance (Nu784 million); (v) \nmonsoon restoration (Nu200 million); and (vi) bridges and other activities. \n \nB.  Road Network and Traffic \n \n3.  In a landlocked country such as Bhutan, socioeconomic development depends largely \non an efficient and reliable road network. Since the construction of the 179 kilometer (km) \nPhuentsholing\u2013Thimphu Highway in 1959, the national road network has expanded to about \n4,947 km of motorable roads, including 1,632 km of national highways, 489 km of district roads, \n813 km of feeder roads, 150 km of urban roads, 717 km of farm roads, and 560 km of forest \nroads. This gives a road density of 0.13 km per square km and 7.5 km per 1,000 inhabitants. \nThe km per inhabitants figure is relatively high in comparison with countries of similar size and \nincome level; this is due to Bhutan\u2019s low population density. Travel between east and west \nregions relies on the single east\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the \ncountry, or it requires going through in India, especially in southern areas of the country. Other \nthan the traditional surface border crossings with India, only one airport provides limited air \naccess to the rest of the world. \n \n4.  Almost all national highways (95%), more than 90% of the district and urban roads, and \nabout 20% of feeder roads are paved. Narrow roads have been built along steep hillsides prone \nto  landslides.  Roads  become  difficult  to  use  during  the  winter  months  and  rainy  season. \nImprovement, maintenance, and expansion of the existing road network is urgently required. \nBecause of the mountainous terrain, the area of land suitable for agriculture is limited, and the ", "Appendix 2       25 \npopulation of less than 700,000 is  distributed in remote  settlements. This  situation makes \nconstruction and maintenance of roads extremely difficult and costly. The widespread use of \nmanual resurfacing can only provide low-quality pavement. \n \n5.  The number of motor vehicle registrations increased from 29,914 in 2005 to 35,703 in \n2007, which is an average annual increase of 9.2%. The highest increase was in light vehicles \nat 13%, and there was not much increase in two-wheelers. Out of 35,703 motor vehicles \nregistered, over 60% were light vehicles and taxis, 20% were two-wheelers, and 13% were \nheavy vehicles.  \n \n6.  Despite rapid traffic growth, the number of reported accidents has decreased from 1,039 \naccidents with 22 fatalities in 2005 to 858 accidents with 18 fatalities in 2007. This translates to \n5 annual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, which is low in comparison with other lower and middle-\nincome countries where the range is 5\u2013100 annual fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. However, the \nextent of underreporting of accidents, especially in rural areas, is not known. Considering the \nhigh rate of vehicle increase, these positive statistics may not be sustained. \n \nC.  Bhutan Road Asset Management \n \n7.  The DoR under the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS) has direct \nresponsibility for 2,449 km of roads, comprising 1,125 km of national highways, 419 km of \ndistrict roads, 805 km of feeder roads, and 100 km of urban roads. The road network under the \nDoR has increased by almost 16%, from 2,120 km in 2005. DANTAK, an organization under the \nArmy Engineering Corp of the India Border Force, has constructed and maintained the country's \nmain road network since 1959, and continues to maintain 12% of Bhutan's main road network \nunder a grant from the Government of India. Farm roads, forest roads, and some feeder roads \nare managed by the Departments of Agriculture, Forestry and Education, and local roads and \nmule tracks are the responsibility of local government authorities. The DoR is also responsible \nfor the management of the national workforce, which has been primarily employed for force-\naccount road construction and maintenance works. \n \n8.  The DoR is responsible for the planning, construction, and management of roads. The \ndirector general is the technical and administrative head of the DoR, reporting to the secretary \nof the MoWHS. The headquarters is organized with four divisions which are responsible for \nconstruction and maintenance of roads: the Survey and Design Division, the Investigation and \nDevelopment Division, the Roads Division, and the Bridge Division. The divisions are headed by \nchief engineers who are responsible for implementation of policy and overall supervision of DoR \nadministration. In addition to the four divisions, project management units are set up for special \nprojects such as those funded by ADB and the World Bank. \n \n9.  The DoR has eight field divisions, headed by executive engineers who are responsible \nfor the maintenance of about 300 km of roads. A field division has at least three subdivisions, \neach headed by an engineer acting as deputy executive engineer. Deputy executive engineers \nmanage  and  supervise  works  within  their  subdivisions,  involving  design  and  contract \nmanagement, including quality control and testing. Each subdivision has two further sections or \nunits, headed by a junior engineer who is the basic field functionary and is responsible for \nmanaging actual construction activity in the field and taking measurements. Some divisions \nhave laboratories for the mandatory testing of material. \n \n10.  The  existing  DoR  organization  is  fairly  well  in  line  with  the  requirement  of  road \ndevelopment  and  management.  However,  the  capacity  of  the  DoR  in  the  core  processes \n ", "26         Appendix 2 \nrequires strengthening and reorganization. The Construction Development Board (CDB) can \narrange  training  for  contractors  and  DoR  personnel  to  improve  their  skills  in  construction \nmanagement, but capacity and resources are limited. \n \nD.  Implementation Capacity \n \n1.  Procurement and Implementation \n \n11.  Work procurement is governed by the Procurement Rules and Regulation 2009 (PRR \n2009) with the Standard Bidding Document for procurement of works. The rules are applicable \nto all government agencies. The procurement procedures are well defined and cover all aspects \nof  procurement  such  as  registration  of  bidders,  organization  of  procurement,  procurement \nmethods, bidding process, and award of contract. The PRR 2009 also defines institutional \narrangements  for  addressing  grievances  in  the  procurement  process  and  establishing  a \nprocurement  policy  division.  The  Public  Procurement  Policy  Division  has  already  been \nestablished and is mandated to monitor implementation of rules and regulations, and develop \nand  administer  the  grievances  review  mechanism  and  deal  with  all  procurement-related \nfunctions such as improvements to procedures, research, training, and capacity development. \nPRR grants exemption to the application of rules for externally funded projects if required. \n \n12.  There is a need for more training for procurement professionals and contractors in \nprocurement  process,  contracts,  and  contract  implementation.  In  addition  to  the  Public \nProcurement Policy Division, the CDB is organizing training courses for contractors. Under the \nproposed Project, a consultant will be engaged for procurement assistance. \n \n13.  The procurement of works for the ongoing ADB-funded Road Network Project (RNP-1) is \nundertaken  by  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  which  has  successfully  completed \nprocurement for 12 projects so far. The time taken from the date of bid invitation to contract \neffectiveness ranged from 4 months to 7 months, except in cases where no technically qualified \nbid was obtained in the first instance which has added 2\u20133 months time for rebidding. The DoR \nis now very familiar with ADB requirements. \n \n14.  The main weaknesses in project execution are design finalization, procurement, and \nland acquisition. The DoR has increased the number of engineers, especially in the survey and \ndesign areas, and further capacity enhancement in terms of the number of engineers and skills \nand  knowledge  is  required.  For  safeguard  implementation,  the  DoR  has  strengthened  its \ncapacity to satisfy interministerial procedures, such as environmental clearance, and enhanced \nits familiarity with ADB procurement procedures. During the regional workshop, representatives \nfrom dzongkhags (districts) with project roads were invited for discussions to expedite land \nacquisition  processes. For  procurement, the DoR has  been  exposed to ADB  procurement \nprocedures after several ADB projects. Private sector contractors have also gained experience \nthrough a number of larger works. The DoR takes initiatives to ensure the timely completion of \nhigh-quality construction works, and these include the regular monitoring of project progress. \n \n15.  Under the Project, the DoR will outsource design works to international engineering \nconsultants,  who  will  provide  procurement  assistance  support  including  finalizing  bidding \ndocuments.  On  safeguard  aspects,  while  dzongkhags  are  competent  authorities  for  land \nacquisition, the DoR has offered support such as surveys. The social and resettlement specialist \nunder  the  design  and  supervision  consultant  will  also  provide  training  to  the  DoR  and \ndzongkhag officers to familiarize them with ADB policies and requirements, thus improving the ", "Appendix 2       27 \nGovernment's capacity in safeguard implementation. The attached technical assistance will \nenhance DoR capacity in the planning and engineering of roads using modern technologies.  \n \n2.  Financial Management \n \n16.  The MoWHS Accounts Division looks after the entire ministry accounts, which includes \nthe Department of Roads. It administers both the fiscal and project accounts. MoWHS financial \nmanagement  is  guided  by  the  Financial  Rules  and  Regulations  2007  as  provided  in  the \nFinancial  Manual  2001  of  the  Government.  The  MoWHS  Accounts  Division  is  staffed  by \nexperienced  staff  deputed  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  accounting  system  is  fully \ncomputerized (known as the Budget and Accounting System [BAS]), a computerized double-\nentry cash accounting system which  is used across all government agencies. The accounting \ndivision staff are well trained in the BAS. The Fixed Asset Register (FAR) is maintained for all \ngoods purchases and inventoried.1 Monthly reports of receipt and appropriation are generated \nby the BAS and submitted to the Department of Public Accounts (DPA) through the parent \nministry. The DPA consolidates the monthly reports and submits the annual report for all the \nagencies. While the Internal Audit Division carries out auditing of the ministry\u2019s accounts, the \nRoyal  Audit Authority  is  the  designated  agency  of  the  Government  for  annual  auditing  of \ngovernment and project accounts as per statutory requirement. \n \n17.  The ongoing ADB project has a full-time accounts officer, assisted by an accounting \nassistant,  posted  to  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  The  transactions  are  recorded \nthrough the BAS and monthly financial reports are generated from the BAS. No particular \ndifficulty was reported by the PIU in project accounting and reporting for the Project. A separate \nproject account is maintained for receiving funds from ADB and the Government. There has \nbeen difficulty and delay in obtaining required documentation in a timely manner from the \ncontractors to process the payments and submit documentation for replenishment of funds from \nADB. This process is being improved and the PIU expects that the processing of both payments \nand replenishments can be done in a timely manner. \n \n18.  ADB funds for the Government are received through the Royal Monetary Authority, \nwhich in turn informs the DPA. The DPA then releases the funds, as per the budget provisions \n(which includes the Government\u2019s contribution) for all planned programs and projects, to the \nexecuting agency. For projects, the PMO has a joint signatory imprest account with the Bank of \nBhutan for all appropriations, with the project manager and the accountant as the signatories. \n \n19.  Overall,  the  financial  management  and  accounting  system  is  well  established.  The \nProject is a repeated operation and the financial management arrangements for the Project will \nremain the same as they were for the RNP-I. The Government is familiar with managing \nexternal funds, as well as utilizing, accounting, and reporting for the same. However, there were \nsome errors in claims submitted for the RNP-I. This was partly attributed to weak capacity of the \nPMO and its misunderstanding of claim processing procedures. Recently, ADB has conducted \ntraining on ADB loan disbursement procedures, which was attended by project accountants and \nproject coordinators of ongoing ADB projects in Bhutan. To ensure continuity and the transfer of \ninstitutional knowledge from RNP-I for the Project, DoR officers experienced in RNP-I will \nprovide support to the new PMO on the requirement basis.  \n \n \n                                                \n1  The goods/consumables are not reported in the FAR, although a stock register is required to be maintained for \nshowing receipt and issue to maintain accountability. \n ", "28         Appendix 2 \nE.  Road Transport Regulation and Industry \n \n20.  The Road Safety and Transport Authority (RSTA) of the Ministry of Information and \nCommunications is responsible for all motor vehicle-related activities including registration and \nlicensing and roadworthiness and emission tests. The RSTA regulates the transport industry \nand sets tariffs. The tariffs are binding for passenger traffic but are considered indicative for \nfreight as it only applies to hiring by the Government. Large transport contracts are generally \ncontracted out by industries in open tender to both transport companies and truck owners. The \nfreight transport market is fully competitive. The size of the truck fleet has risen significantly in \nrecent years and increased competition is reported. \n \n21.  Privatization of bus operations was initiated in 1985 and all routes were privatized by \nOctober 1999. As of June 2009, the RSTA had 124 bus routes covering 18 dzongkhags (except \nGasa and Pemagatshel) operated by 35 private operators. There are 180 buses in operation \n(excluding city buses), which is above the RSTA public transport target in the 10th FYP (170 \nbuses). Private operators may propose new routes for operation for RSTA permission, which is \nprovided based on assessment of potential demand. New routes proposed by RSTA will be \ncontracted out based on open competition, with passenger fares regulated by the RSTA on the \nbasis of direct cost plus operational overhead. Public demand for transport services has been \nincreasing, and the frequency of service has increased and operation hours expanded. There \ncontinues to be strong demand for more routes, and this will grow with the construction of many \nnew roads. To encourage private operators to purchase new buses for better services, the \nRSTA has waived import duty for buses as a subsidy measure, and operation contracts have \nbeen extended to 10 years. \n \n22.  The Road Safety and Transport Act of 1999 defines the roles of RSTA and the traffic \npolice in implementing the road traffic safety rules. The act reflects modern practice and the \ntraffic safety rules are in line with international standards.  \n \nF.  Road Expenditure and Revenue \n \n23.  Budgetary expenditure of the DoR under the 9th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2002\u20132007, \nextended to 2008) was Nu7,418 million ($161 million) against an original budget of Nu6,566 \nmillion ($143 million). The substantial increase in expenditure is due to extension of the 9th FYP \nto 2008. The average annual expenditure is Nu1,236 million against the original average annual \nexpenditure of Nu1,313 million, which is 6% underspending. This demonstrates remarkable \nimprovement in DoR capacity and commitment. Under the 10th FYP (2008\u20132013), the overall \nbudget is Nu13,708 million, which is 1.8 times (2.2 times on the annual basis) the amount in the \n9th FYP due to the new Government\u2019s priority for road rehabilitation and development.  \n \n24.  Specific charges for road use are taxes on motor vehicles levied by the RSTA, including \nannual registration, renewal, and ownership transfer fees, were Nu97 million in 2008, increasing \nfrom Nu60 million in 2005. In addition, road users pay sales tax on fuel and custom duties and \nsales tax on vehicles, which was Nu121 million in 2005 and Nu152 million in 2008. Revenue \nrelating to road use was Nu249 million in 2008, increasing from Nu181 million in 2005; this is \nabsorbed into general government revenue. The average annual increase is very high at 15.6%. \n \nG.  Main Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n \n25.  Despite the expansion of the road network, it requires improvement in terms of coverage \nand condition. Demands of road transport are increasing. One of the major concerns with ", "Appendix 2       29 \nBhutan's trunk road network is that the country is dependent on the single east\u2013west national \nhighway running through the northern part of the country. The absence of a similar east\u2013west \nhighway running through the south constrains travel in the southern part. \n \n26.  Under the 10th FYP, the construction of the Southern East\u2013West Highway is a major \nroad  infrastructure  development  priority,  in  addition  to  road  construction  connecting  to \nhydropower projects. The Southern East\u2013West Highway will facilitate industrial development in \nthe southern economic hubs and special economic zones and integrate them more effectively \nwith their primary markets in India. Additionally, the Southern East\u2013West Highway will provide \nan internal transit route for Bhutanese passengers and goods, i.e., an alternative to the existing \neast\u2013west national highway running through the northern part of the country. The 10th FYP also \nput priority on continued maintenance and management of road assets, quality assurance and \nstandardization, and strengthening of the road construction industry. \n \n1.  Department of Roads Capacity Building \n \n27.  There was only a very limited role for Government staff, local engineers, and contractors \nin road planning, construction, and management until the early 1990s. Since the 8th FYP \n(1997\u20132002), the Government and domestic private sector contractors have gained experience \nin road sector development and management, and the total DoR budget under the 10th FYP is \nNu13.7 billion. To manage the massive investment in roads, the DoR has initiated capacity \nstrengthening and the streamlining of its business procedures. One of the major initiatives \nincludes corporatization of the mechanical division with the establishment of the Construction \nDevelopment Corporation (CDC) in July 2007. Utilization of equipment and work efficiency of \nthe CDC has been increased. \n \n28.  The DoR will continue to further strengthen its capacity in both the policy and planning \nand engineering and technical aspects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has \nprovided engineers on a long-term basis to the DoR to strengthen its engineering capacity. SNV \nBhutan has provided experts to provide training for design and construction with environmental \nconsiderations.  Under  the  proposed  attached  TA,  assistance  will  be  provided  in  asset \nmanagement and road technologies of survey, design, and construction, and especially on \nenvironmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) methods. \n \n2.  Road Maintenance Financing \n29.  During the extended 9th FYP (2002\u20132008), the expenditure on resurfacing was Nu1,215 \nmillion for 1,285 km and for routine maintenance was Nu623 million for 2,307 km. The average \ncost per km of Nu945,000 for resurfacing and Nu45,000 for routine maintenance is considered \nappropriate.  The  average  annual  length  scheduled  for  resurfacing  was  214  km,  which  is \nconsidered to be about a 7-year resurfacing period. \n \n30.  Under the 10th FYP, the budget for resurfacing is Nu1,389 million for a planned 1,415 \nkm, and for routine maintenance Nu784 million. The budget per km is considered adequate and \nthe average annual length for resurfacing is about 280 km, which is about a 30% increase from \nthe 9th FYP. All roads are now in a periodic maintenance cycle. The average cost per km both \nfor resurfacing and routine maintenance has been increased to ensure better quality through \nmore mechanization. \n \n31.  Efficiency of the use of the maintenance budget has also improved. The productivity of \nthe large national workforce for routine maintenance has been improved during the 9th FYP \n ", "30         Appendix 2 \nfrom 1 km per person to 1.5 km per person through scheduled retirements, a freeze on new \nrecruitment, and increasing mechanization. A recent DoR initiative includes the introduction of \nperformance-based contracts in routine maintenance for a batch of road sections to a group of \nroad workers. The DoR continues to improve the road asset management systems for optimal \nallocation of the budget. The construction industry\u2019s experience with mechanized roadworks is \nincreasing as the volume of works increases. These actions demonstrate the Government\u2019s \nincreased commitment to maintenance and the increased efficiency of road maintenance works. \n \n32.  Taking into account the past budgetary provision and the trend, the Government is \nassessed as being able to adequately provide maintenance financing in a sustainable manner. \nIncreased  maintenance  quality  and  productivity  due  to  increased  mechanization,  quality \nassurance  systems,  the  recent  introduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  routine \nmaintenance, and more adoption of EFRC techniques and appropriate road technologies, will \nalso increase the efficiency of maintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. The \nGovernment has given assurances that it will provide adequate financing to maintain roads \ndeveloped under Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \n \n  3.  Construction Quality \n \n33.  Construction quality is a critical element for sustainable operation and management, and \nachieving it requires strengthening the capacity of both the Government and the private sector \nin quality assurance and control. The Government mandates the DoR to review design for all \nroads, including farm roads, which will enhance the quality of roads at all levels. Considerations \nwould also require the use of appropriate design and technology for building roads in the \ncontext of Bhutan, including traffic, weather, and soil conditions. Simple, low-cost methods are \noften more appropriate and effective in terms of construction speed, quality, and environmental \nconsideration, e.g., use of natural gravel, etc. The proposed Project will consider design and \ntechnology for simple, low-cost methods as appropriate. \n \n34.  The Standards and Quality Control Authority (SQCA) under the Ministry of Works and \nHuman Settlement is responsible for improving quality assurance. A technical specification was \nrenewed  and  published  in  February  2005,  incorporating  environmental  considerations.  All \nconstruction materials require certification by SQCA for use. The proposed attached TA project \nwill provide training in road technologies, which will help improve quality during the survey, \ndesign, and construction phases. \n \n4.  Construction Industry \n \n35.  With  limited  works  in  the  past,  the  local  construction  industry  has  little  capacity. \nHowever, local contractors have gained experience since the 8th FYP, and there has been \nfurther promotion of private sector participation under the 9th FYP. The amount of contracting \nout to the private sector has increased from Nu70 million under the 7th FYP (1992\u20131997) to \nNu1,027 million under the 8th FYP (1997\u20132002) and Nu3,806 million under the 9th FYP. The \ncontract awards under ADB's Road Improvement Project2 (Nu500 million) and Road Network \nProject3 (Nu1,232 million) greatly contributed to this increase. \n \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "Appendix 2       31 \n36.  The Construction Development Board (CDB) has a computerized registration system for \ncontractors and an interim mechanism for dispute resolution. The CDB will continue with these \nconstruction development services, research and technology development, and awareness of \nbest  practices. Training  provided  under  the  attached  TA  project  could  be  open  to  private \ncontractors. \n \n37.  Under the 10th FYP, the DoR will coordinate all roadwork contracts to be outsourced to \nthe private sector. Regional and internationally accredited engineering and construction firms \nwill also be encouraged to participate, in joint ventures with national construction firms where \nnecessary,  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  project  delivery.  Under  the  Project, \ninternational competitive bidding will be adopted. \n \n5.  Vehicle Pollution Control \n \n38.  To minimize pollution, the Government made a pollution control certificate for all vehicles \ncompulsory, and so all vehicles are required to have pollution checks. The RSTA encourages \nthe establishment of private sector pollution check centers, and there are two such centers so \nfar\u2014in Thimphu and Phuentsholing. The Government has continued to establish permanent \npollution check centers, but needs to establish more centers in major cities, with emission test \nmachines to be installed in each center.  \n \n6.  Overloading \n \n39.  Overloading is an emerging problem in Bhutan as the size of vehicles increases. It is \nalso  expected  that  overloaded  trucks  will  operate  on  the  major  national  highways  as  the \neconomy  grows. An  overloading  control program is  being set  up  with  initial  installation  of \nweighbridges at major border points such as Gelephu, Jongkhar, Phuentsholing, Samdrup and \nSamtse. Mobile weighbridges are available and more weighbridges will be installed in industrial \ntowns. An overloading penalty of Nu500 per ton is strictly enforced.  \n \n7.  Road Safety \n \n40.  Bhutan  has  a  lower  accident  rate  compared  with  other  lower  and  middle-income \ncountries. However, the extent of underreporting of accidents, especially in rural areas, is not \nknown. Considering the high growth of the vehicle fleet, these positive statistics may not be \nsustained. \n \n41.  The Road Safety and Transport Regulation of 1999 provides regulations for registration \nand licensing, commercial passenger vehicles, traffic control, and enforcement mechanisms. \nMeasures have been taken to educate all drivers on basic safety precautions and many driving \nrefresher courses have been organized. Vehicle inspections have been conducted, including \npredeparture inspection for buses and inspection of all vehicles every year, except commercial \nvehicles for which inspection is conducted every half year. Awareness of the need to improve \nroad safety is increasing. High-risk accident areas are identified and reported to the DoR for \nfuture improvement. Road safety audits are undertaken under the Project. \n ", "32      Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \n \nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank Loan and Technical Assistance Projects \n \nProject Name  Approval  Amount  Grant/Loan \nDate  ($) \nMultiproject  1983  5,000,000  Loan \nRoadworks Mechanization  1986  4,500,000  Loan \nEast\u2013West Highway Maintenance  1993  5,200,000  Loan \nRoad Improvement  2000  12,800,000  Loan \nMultiproject  22-Sep-83  145,000  Grant \nRoad Construction and Training  24-Jun-85  75,000  Grant \nInstitutional Strengthening of Public Works Department  28-Oct-86  150,000  Grant \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Department of Roads  6-Sep-91  530,000  Grant \nRoad Project  30-Mar-92  250,000  Grant \nDevelopment of Maintenance Management System  18-Nov-93  390,000  Grant \nConstruction Management  18-Nov-93  740,000  Grant \nRoad Transport Network Development  15-Dec-98  650,000  Grant \nCapacity Building of the Construction Development Board  15-Jan-99  400,000  Grant \nRoad Planning and Management Strengthening  4-Aug-00  954,000  Grant \nRoad Network Expansion  10-Jul-03  500,000  Grant \nRoad Network Project  30-Sep-05  27,300,000  Loan \nCapacity  Building  for  Road  Safety  and  Road  Asset  30-Sep-05  300,000  Grant \nManagement \nPreparing Road Network Project II  10-Sep-08  650,000  Grant \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nTable A3.2.

", "Appendix 4        33 \nPROJECT ROADS AND SUMMARY OF DESIGN STANDARDS \n \n1.  The intention of the Road Network Project II is to construct and rehabilitate about 121 \nkilometers (km) of national highway (23 km of which is of feeder roads standard) and about 62 \nkm of feeder roads in Bhutan. \n \nTable A4: Project Roads \nContract Packages  Length (km) \nNational Highway   \n  Manitar\u2013Raidak    37 \n  Raidak\u2013Lhamoizingkha  25 \n  Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong (Ngangalam)  36 \n  Samdrupcholing\u2013Samranga  23 \nFeeder Roads   \n  Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Durung Ri  62 \nkm = kilometer. \na  Feeder road design standard. \nSource: Department of Roads \n \n2.  The general guidelines given in the Road Survey and Design Manual published in June \n2005 by the Department of Roads and the Road Design Manual Part-1 (Geometric Design of \nRural Roads) have been adopted as the design standards for the study. Suitable modifications \nand additions have been incorporated to suit local conditions and study requirements. The \nproject roads covered under this study are characterized by steep mountains and deep gorges. \nFactors such as weak geology, varying topography and climate conditions, and environmental \nrequirements dictate the choice of road alignment. Short sections of the road however do pass \nthrough rolling to hilly terrain. \n  \n3.  The general principle adopted was to follow the existing alignment as much as possible \nto limit the extent of land acquisition and earthworks and to maximize the use of the existing \nroad formation. Where the existing alignment proved unsafe for suggested traffic speeds, minor \nhorizontal realignments are proposed for some of the sections to improve safety and general \ndrivability.  The  major  geometric  design  elements  constituting  the  cross-section  are  the \ncarriageway, the shoulders, and the side drain. The carriageways include the traveled way and \npassing bays. \n \n4.  A detailed description of the design approach is as follows: \n \n(i)  Cross-section. For national highways: two lanes, single carriageway, 5.5 meters \n(m) wide with earth shoulders 1.5 m wide. For feeder roads: single lane, single \ncarriageway, 3.50 m wide, with 0.5 m earth shoulders and passing bays. \n \n(ii)  Rights-of-way. A 30 m wide right of way has been recommended for all project \nroads to accommodate future road connections or changes in alignment, road \nwidth, or junction layout of existing roads, and to improve the safety, safety \noperation, and appearance of the roads. \n \n(iii)  Design speed. As per the Bhutanese standards, 60 km per hour will be the \ndesign speed. This is, however, only economically justifiable in flat or rolling \n ", "34      Appendix 4 \nterrain. As all roads are in steep mountains and deep gorges, design speeds of \n40 km per hour were justifiable and therefore applied.  \n \n(iv)  Design life. Twenty years after opening to traffic (2032). \n \n(v)  Pavement. The pavements are designed for 10 years and take into account \nprojected traffic loading, existing pavement structure, subgrade California bearing \nratio (a test of subgrade mechanical strength), and quality of materials available. \nFor national highways, double bituminous surface treatment surfacing, wet mix \nmacadam base course, and profile correction is recommended. For feeder roads, \nunsealed gravel surface course is recommended. \n \n(vi)  Bridges. The highway has several bridges. The bridge types recommended is \nreinforced cement concrete (RCC) for up to 20 m spans. \n  \n(vii)  Drainage. The drainage system recommended includes culverts, bridges, and \nside  drains,  cut-off  drains,  and  catch  water  drains.  RCC  slab  culverts  are \nrecommended.  \n \n5.  In addition, the following safety and roadside features will be incorporated: \n \n(i)  Road safety structures (breast walls, retaining walls, toe walls, and check walls), \nwill be reconstructed. Their heights range from 1.0 m to 8.0 m, with an average of \n2.7 m. \n \n(ii)  Bus  stops  with  passenger  shelters  and  truck  turnoffs  will  be  constructed  at \nappropriate locations. \n \n(iii)  Guard rails and crash barriers will be constructed at identified high-risk points \n(although this is limited to what is economically justifiable); however, the following \nengineering measures will increase safety: \n \n(a)  all curve radii will correspond to design speeds, \n(b)  all required widening at curves will be provided, \n(c)  adequate road width will be provided with easy gradients, \n(d)  vision berms will be provided at curves, and \n(e)  proper road markings and signs will be provided. \n \n(iv)  Proper  road  furniture\u2014including  road  signs,  road  markings,  kilometer  posts, \nright-of-way pillars, and guard posts\u2014will be provided. \n \n6.  Construction will incorporate environmental consideration in design and construction \nnow being applied on selected road projects in Bhutan. This will minimize damage to the natural \nenvironment by \n \n(i)  using controlled blasting, \n(ii)  limiting the use of bulldozers (excavator-tipper combinations will be used instead), \n(iii)  using log and boulder barriers to control slipping of blasted or excavated materials, \nand \n(iv)  incorporating bioengineering techniques.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Bhutan National Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies remoteness and isolation as the major causes of poverty in \nBhutan, and prioritizes the extension and improvement of physical infrastructure, including communications and planned \nurbanization, as strategic interventions to combat poverty. The Government has given the development of road infrastructure \nthe highest priority in the 10th Five-Year Plan. The Bhutan country operations business plan (2008\u20132010)a prioritizes Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to the transport sector to enhance the connectivity and accessibility of remote and rural \nareas.  \n \nMore than half of the population of Bhutan lives in rural areas. Road network connectivity is therefore a key factor in the \nGovernment\u2019s overall development goals. For this reason, the Government is highly committed to developing and promoting \nthe proposed Project, from which a larger part of the population is expected to benefit. Access to roads in rural areas is a key \nelement of human development and economic growth. It is also expected to improve health care services and education. \nMost of all, it means a greater range of opportunities for rural people to improve their quality of life and capacity to generate \nincome. It will also improve the living conditions of women and children. Another immediate tangible benefit is the reduction of \ntime spent in travelling and therefore the increase in productivity by more business opportunities and employment in rural \nareas of Bhutan.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nRemoteness and isolation are the major causes of poverty in Bhutan. The construction of national highways and feeder roads \ncovering 183.0 kilometers (km) (Manitar\u2013Raidak, 37.0 km; Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha, 25.0 km; Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong, 36.0 \nkm; Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang, 23.0 km; and Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013Shingchungri, 62.0 km) will have direct benefits for the local \npopulation (poor people, vulnerable groups, and households headed by women). The Project is expected to improve the \nquality of life and bring new economic opportunities to remote areas of the country. It is also expected to increase economic \nactivity (particularly in small retail) at the road sites and increased accessibility due to construction of access roads connected \nto the main roads.  \n \nThe socioeconomic impacts of the Project will be very positive: access to health care facilities and education, improved \ncommunication facilities, easy transportation of cash crops, and vibrant growth of economic activities in the rural villages. \nRural electrification is also expected to improve once road connectivity is established. This will permit students to study for \nlonger hours in the evening, and contribute to a cleaner living environment through the use of electricity and gas for cooking, \nthus also saving the forests from further degradation. \n \nThe income-generation activities of the population of the immediate and wider project influence areas are expected to \nincrease through sales of local produce at the road sites almost on a daily basis. As a result, the Project will significantly \nreduce the poverty level and improve the quality of life in the five beneficiary dzongkhags (districts)\u2014Chhukha, Dagana, \nPemagatshel, Samdrupjongkhar, and Zhemgang\u2014through connectivity of these remote rural areas. \n \n2.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThis analysis covers the poverty and social analysis of the proposed five roads under the Project. The household survey \ncovered 68 villages: 22 villages on the Manitar\u2013Raidak road, 16 villages on the Raidak\u2013Lhamoizhingkha road, 8 villages on \nthe Panbang\u2013Amshingwoong road, 8 villages on the Samdrupcholing\u2013Samrang road, and 14 villages on the Tsebar\u2013Mikuri\u2013\nShingchungri road. The questionnaire developed for this survey was based on the requirements of the Project terms of \nreference, with reference to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in ADB Operations (1993)b and \nADB\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis (2001)c. \n \nThe survey was based on a random sampling approach using population size. The household survey began meeting with the \nvillage headman or a representative of the geog (block), through which either the existing road passed or through which the \nproposed national roads might be aligned. Twenty percent of the total households of gewogs (villages) were selected for \ninterview by randomly selecting the visibly poor and rich households. Consultation with the communities (324 male and 162 \nfemale participants) and 16 focus group discussions at different levels were another component. These activities were \nconducted simultaneously with the household survey and by the same survey team at different times and locations. The \ndiscussions were conducted in different part of the villages falling under the same geog and within the project influence area \nregardless of the affected persons. All the respondent sample households reported that most women spend time on \npurchasing household items, collecting drinking water and fuel wood and supporting cultivation. Women in villages are also \nactively involved in religious and cultural activities.  \n \nSince most of the villages are located far from motorable roads, the villagers have to walk a considerable distance to reach \nthe road heads. There are community, primary, lower secondary, middle secondary, higher secondary, and private schools in \nall the five dzongkhags. In most of the villages, children walk for 30 minutes to 3 hours to get to school. There are basic health \nunits, outreach clinics, and general hospitals in all the five dzongkhags. Not all the houses have drinking water due to poor \nwater sources.  \nThe people in the influence areas are agricultural farmers, with 90% being engaged in agricultural activities. Some \nhouseholds reported combining their agricultural activities with shopkeeping and with some wage activities. The main cereals \ngrown are rice, maize, wheat, and millet. The cash crops grown are mainly areca nut, oranges, and cardamom. The villagers \nalso tend to cattle farming and produce milk, cheese, and butter, which are locally consumed, and the surpluses are sold. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. A socioeconomic survey covering 20% of the total households of geogs, and 16 focus group discussions were conducted in \nFebruary\u2013April 2009 to gather feedback from the local communities on the proposed development, perceived socioeconomic \nimpacts, and acceptable alignment of the access road. These discussions were held with men, women, farmers, high-income \ngroups, poor people, shopkeepers, and government officials to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the project as well as \nits impacts. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe C&P plan was prepared to inform and collate public views to facilitate informed decisions. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nGender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by undertaking a process of gender analysis so as to \nassess the impact of the Project. Sixteen focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different \nsocioeconomic groups such as high-income, poor, and women of different ethnicity. These discussions revealed that the \nmajority of the women felt that the roads will benefit them as they will be able to transport their yield for market and this will \nhelp increase income. The study revealed no significant discrimination against women in Bhutan. The socioeconomic survey \nshowed that, although some activities may be predominantly undertaken by women or men, women and men traditionally \nhave equal status for most socioeconomic activities. The studies also revealed that rural women are becoming more visible in \nboth household and other activities, and women are frequently taking on additional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for \ntheir families. Along with men in the project areas, women will benefit from (i) easier access to external markets, (ii) increased \nlocal retailing opportunities, and (iii) easier access to health care centers and education facilities. Women may also benefit \nmore than men from the increased access to schools. Traditionally enrolment rates in schools have been lower for girls than \nfor boys. \n ", " 50            Appendix 11 \n \n2.
