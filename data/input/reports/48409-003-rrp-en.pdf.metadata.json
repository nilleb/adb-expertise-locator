The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGlobal Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) for the project and if the Board approves \nthe  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the grant.1  \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  project  supports  fulfilling  the  government\u2019s  Agriculture  Development \nStrategy  (ADS),  2018\u20132023  and  the  National  Export  Strategy,  2015-2019  by  boosting \ncompetitiveness in value chains for rice, beans, pulses, and oilseeds in the Magway, Mandalay, \nand Sagaing regions in the central dry zone (CDZ).2  The project will increase climate resilience \nfor critical rural infrastructure, promote quality and safety testing capacity, strengthen technical \nand  institutional  capacity  for  climate-smart  agriculture  (CSA),  and  create  an  enabling  policy \nenvironment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. The project will reduce food insecurity and rural \npoverty, increase incomes and access to markets for smallholders and poor landless households, \nand improve resource efficiency and environmental sustainability for agribusinesses.    \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nSector  performance. The  Human  Development  Index  report  ranks  Myanmar  as  145th \nout of 188 countries.3 Myanmar\u2019s gross domestic product grew at 6.8% in 2017 and is projected \nto grow at 6.8% in 2018 and 7.2% in 2019.4 However, 32.1% of the population remains poor,5 and \nthe poverty incidence in the CDZ is high (43%).6  The CDZ has 15.4 million inhabitants, most of \nwhom (76%) live in rural areas; 58% of CDZ households depend on crops for their livelihoods. \nTackling rural poverty is critical to ensure sustainable development in the CDZ. In 2016 agriculture \naccounted for 30% of gross domestic product, 60% of employment, 29% of value addition, and \n23% of exports (including $1.1 billion in pulses alone).7 Crop production accounts for 72% of farm \noutput. As a percentage of national production, the CDZ produces 25% of rice, 48% of pulses, \nand 89% of sesame. The potential for developing the value chains of these crops is significant. \n\n4. \nDevelopment challenges. Despite good resource endowments, agricultural production \nand productivity remain low, primarily due to (i) poor infrastructure, (ii) low-quality inputs, (iii) weak \ninstitutional capacity, (iv) limited access to finance, and (v) high vulnerability to climate risks.8 A \nfarmer in Myanmar earns only about $1.80\u2013$2.50 per day compared to $10\u2013$16.50 in Thailand \nand $7.80 in the Philippines (footnote 5). Most farms are small, subsistence-level holdings with \nlow productivity (average paddy yields in Myanmar are 2.7 tons per hectare versus a potential \nyield of 6.8 tons per hectare). Low usage and quality of certified seed and agro-chemicals, limited \n\n                                                \n1  GAFSP was established by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as trustee. \n2  Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation. 2018.

Tokyo. \n\n7  The European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar. 2017. Myanmar: Agriculture Guide 2018. Yangon. \n8  The average farm size in Myanmar (3 hectares) is more than in other Asian countries. Four river systems supply \nmore than 19,000 cubic meters per capita of water each year, against an average 4,000 cubic meters across Asia.  \n\n \n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nirrigation, and poor quality and safety of farm products also contribute to low sector performance. \nLess than 5% of rice farmers in the CDZ use certified seed, while pulse and oilseed farmers use \nalmost  none.  Private  seed  providers  have  been  unable  to  produce  enough  to  meet  demand \nbecause of the poor business environment. Only 15% of crop area is irrigated, and more than \n50%  of  the  rural  population  lacks  access  to  all-season  roads,  hindering  farm-to-market \nconnectivity. Credit (which is often unavailable) is of short tenure, and given only to land owners. \nIncreased migration to urban areas and neighboring countries is worsening labor shortages. Farm \nmechanization is limited. Inefficient post-harvest operations such as drying are leading to reduced \nquality, and poor returns to farmers and processors. Most exported crops are unprocessed and \nsold to lower-value markets. Private sector investment in agribusiness is limited because of the \npoor enabling policy environment related to land use and administration.9 In Doing Business 2018, \nthe  World  Bank  ranks  Myanmar  171st  out  of  190  economies.10  During  1998\u20132017,  only  23 \nagricultural enterprises attracted foreign direct investment, amounting to $380 million or 0.51% of \ntotal foreign direct investment (footnote 5). \n\nMyanmar has one of the highest rankings in the 2017 global climate risk index.11 While \n5. \ntotal precipitation has changed little from 1990, the rainy season has shortened due to late onset \nand early withdrawal of the southwest monsoon, causing intense rainfall and flooding. Increasing \ntemperatures, shallow soils, a long dry season, the increasing frequency of severe droughts, and \npoor crop husbandry are adding substantial risk to agriculture. Climate change projections to 2050 \nsuggest Myanmar will experience longer dry spells and periods of heavy rains.12  \n\n6. \nOpportunities.  Policy  reforms  undertaken  since  2011  have  enhanced  the  potential  for \ngrowth  in  the  agricultural  sector.13  Investing  in  infrastructure,  capacity  and  the  enabling  policy \nenvironment can unlock agribusiness\u2019s potential. Improved access to certified seeds, water, and \nland and finance, and the use of quality agro-chemicals and climate- resilient varieties can lift crop \nproductivity to regional norms and address climate change. Investments in resilient farm roads \ncan  increase  market  connectivity,  while  quality  and  safety  testing  of  infrastructure  can  boost \nexport  potential.  The  potential  for  exports  can  be  enhanced  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nsmallholders  in  good  agricultural  practices  (GAPs)  and  CSA,  and  of  agribusinesses  in  good \nmanufacturing  practices  and  safety  standards.  Support  for  formulating  climate-  and  investor-\nfriendly agribusiness policies, coupled with enhanced land administration and credit services at \nthe township level, can spur faster, better, and stronger agribusiness growth.   \n\n7. \nGovernment\u2019s strategies. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) \nhas developed the ADS, 2018\u20132023 (footnote 2), the agriculture sector second five-year plan, a \nrice sector development strategy, and a CSA strategy.14 The ADS aims to improve food security \nand  agricultural  competitiveness.  The  five-year  sector  plan  aims  to  improve  irrigation,  crop \nproduction,  agro-industry, markets,  and  research. The  CSA  strategy  aims  to  achieve food  and \nnutrition security and climate resiliency, with a globally competitive agriculture sector by 2030. \n\n8. \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  value  addition.  The  project  includes  innovations \nsuch as (i) improved design standards of rural infrastructure to make it climate-resilient and more \nsustainable, (ii) expanded use of advanced CSA technologies and practices, and (iii) promotion \n\n                                                \n9   Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. 2016.

The \nproject will support three pillars of the ADS (productivity, competitiveness, and governance) by \nenhancing the  climate resilience of  critical  infrastructure,  promoting  CSA, formulating  inclusive \nagribusiness policies, and helping the private sector to achieve efficiency and value addition. The \nproject will deploy climate-resilient varieties, enhance capacity, diversify livelihood options, and \nfoster  public\u2013private  partnerships  by  linking  smallholder  farmers  and  the  private  sector.  By \ntargeting rice, bean, pulse, and oilseed value chains in up to 14 townships in the CDZ, the project \nwill focus on a region in Myanmar with some of the highest food insecurity, natural resource-poor, \nwater-stressed, and climate-vulnerable regions in Myanmar.15 With support from GAFSP grant, \nthe project will target poor landless households or those farming less than 2 hectares to drive an \ninclusive  structural  transformation  of  agriculture that  empowers  the  rural  poor,  and  particularly \nwomen,  through  improved  access  to  water,  land,  finance,  and  the  skills  needed  to  engage  in \nproductive livelihood activities.16  \n\n9. \nDevelopment coordination and lessons. The support of development partners focuses \non four key areas: (i) infrastructure, (ii) production enhancement, (iii) capacity development, and \n(iv) policies and governance.17 The project will contribute to all four areas. It will collaborate with \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation Agency  and  the World Bank  on  irrigation,  the  Livelihoods \nand Food Security Trust Fund on commercialization and financial inclusion, and the Food and \nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations on CSA. The project design incorporates lessons \nfrom projects funded by ADB and other development partners, and complements initiatives such \nas  the  GMS  Core  Agriculture  Support  Program,  and  agricultural  value  chain  support  by  the \nIrrigated  Agriculture  Inclusive Development  Project.18  Lessons  call for  (i) building  infrastructure \nthat  supports  agricultural  value  addition;  (ii)  enhancing  smallholders\u2019  access  to  credit;                     \n(iii)  strengthening  land  management  and  administration  services;  (iv) improving  seed  value \nchains,  product  quality  and  safety  standards;  (iii) creating  a  policy  environment  for  mobilizing \nprivate investments; and (iv) building capacity at every stage of value chains to meet demand in \nhigh-end domestic and international markets.      \n\nStrategic fit. The project is aligned with the ADS, National Export Strategy (footnote 2), \n10. \nand CSA strategy (footnote 14).The project directly supports three of seven operational priorities \nof ADB Strategy 2030, including promoting rural development and food security; tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and \n\n                                                \n15 Townships, selected through a participatory, pro-poor, gender-inclusive approach against specific criteria, include \nPakokku, Magway, Aunglan, Natmauk, and Pwintbyu in Magway region; Mahlaing, Pyawbwe, Natogyi, Sintkaing in \nMandalay region; and Monywa, Shwebo, Sagaing, Yin Mar Bin, and Sarlangyi in Sagaing region.  \n\n16  The project, in cooperation with Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), will invest in five \ncomponents outlined in the GAFSP framework document: (i) raising agricultural productivity; (ii) linking farmers to \nmarket; (iii) reducing risk and vulnerability; (iv) improving non-farm rural livelihoods; and (v) technical assistance, \ninstitution building, and capacity development.

The project is aligned with the following \nimpact:  agricultural  competitiveness  improved.21  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nproductive and resource-efficient agribusiness value chains in project areas developed.22 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nOutput  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure  improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. This output involves improving infrastructure to increase crop productivity and \ndiversification,  and  boost  agricultural  product  quality  and  safety.  Key  activities  include \n(i) upgrading  infrastructure  (irrigation,  farm  roads,  buildings,  farm  machinery,  post-harvest \nequipment,  seed  testing  equipment,  and  agrometeorological  stations)  in  10  Department  of \nAgriculture  (DOA)  seed  farms  for  producing  improved    climate-resilient  seed  of  rice,  beans, \npulses, and oilseeds; (ii) rehabilitating tertiary canals and community reservoirs, and constructing \nshallow  tube  wells  (with  some  linked  to  drip  and  sprinkler  technologies)  to  bring  an  additional \n13,000 hectares under irrigation to benefit up to 35,000 households; (iii) rehabilitating farm roads \nto  climate-resilient  condition  for  improved  connectivity  to  markets  and  for  farm  mechanization; \nand (iv) upgrading the safety and quality testing equipment and instrumentation in MOALI Plant \nProtection Division\u2019s Pesticide Testing Laboratory and Food Safety Testing Laboratory, and the \nMinistry  of  Commerce  Commodity  Testing  and  Quality  Management  Laboratory  to  meet  ISO \n17025 standards, and providing rapid food safety testing kits to DOA and the private sector.  \n\n13. \nThe project includes adaptation measures for designing infrastructure to withstand climate \nchange. It will enable DOA seed farms to link with the private sector, and marketing and business \ndevelopment services.  Further, the project will encourage lead seed growers and seed producer \nassociations to integrate under a public\u2013private partnership for seed multiplication being launched \nby the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund to ensure a guaranteed market for lead seed \ngrowers.  The  project  will  also  support  forming  and  training  water  user  groups  to  operate  and \nmaintain tertiary canals, community reservoirs, and other water management infrastructure. An \nintegrated  approach  to  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  focusing  on  institutions,  capacity \nbuilding, financing, and technology will sustain infrastructure. \n\n14. \nOutput 2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  This  output  will \nenhance  capacity  to  integrate  climate  change  concerns  into  agriculture  and  train  farmers  and \nagribusinesses  in  post-harvest  crop  handling  to  improve  quality  and  market  access,  value \naddition, and contract harvesting.

Farmers will have access to up to $300 in loans annually (secured \nagainst $100 from the project held in a compensating balance account by a competitively selected \nfinancial  service  provider)  to  buy  improved  seed,  agrochemicals,  and  mechanization  services. \nBeneficiaries must participate in training on GAPs and financial literacy to access this credit. \n\n16. \nOutput 3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate-friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  The \nproject will support MOALI and the Ministry of Commerce in crafting policies to promote private \nsector investments and expand access to high-end markets such as Japan. Key activities include \n(i) establishing an agribusiness policy cell within MOALI\u2019s Department of Planning for research \nand advocacy on policies related to land management, contract farming, tenure security, public-\nprivate partnerships, and on harmonization of quality and safety standards; (ii) raising awareness \nand  capacity  of  financial  institutions  to  support  climate-friendly  agribusinesses;  (iii)  enhancing \nweather,  market,  and  credit  information  networks;  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  land \nadministration services in townships by building capacity in participatory land management.  \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n17. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $64.92  million  (Table  1).

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \n\n                                                \n23  Details in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Sector \nlending modality is appropriate for this project as the government has a robust sector development \nplan (footnote 2) and has demonstrated adequate capacity to implement the plan. Overall sector \npolicies are adequate but need improvement to enable the growth of agribusinesses. The modality \nalso  enables  the  government  to  identify  and  finance  additional  subprojects  while  undertaking \nneeded policy reforms associated with sector development plan implementation.24 \n\nThe  summary  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  ADB  will  finance  expenditures  in  relation  to \n19. \nworks, equipment, consulting services, incremental operating costs, and taxes and duties. The \nGAFSP will provide a grant cofinancing of $22 million on a cost-sharing basis, to be administered \nby ADB. The government will finance the equivalent of $1.43 million for salaries of counterpart \nstaff  and  office  space.  The  beneficiaries  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $0.99  million  as  a \ncontribution  to  installation  of  tube  wells.  In  support  of  the  project,  GAFSP  will  provide  parallel \ncollaborative  cofinancing  of  $5  million  on  a  grant  basis,  to  be  administered  by  Food  and \nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations. 25 Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $10.65 \nmillion.

The project \ndesign includes measures to enhance resilience, including changes in infrastructure siting (e.g., \nsediment  traps  to  avoid  excessive  sedimentation,  increasing  the  width  and  depth  of  irrigation \ncanals  for  added  storage,  increasing  embankment  heights  of  farm  roads,  providing  cross \ndrainage, and reducing soil erosion through measures such as restoration of the vegetation in the \nimmediate landscape). The project team conducted technical due diligence for three subprojects: \n(i) Chepa seed farm, (ii) minor canal rehabilitation, and (iii) shallow tubewell-based supplementary \nirrigation. All representative subprojects were evaluated against a set of eligibility criteria, which \nare  detailed  in  the  PAM.  The  project  uses  a  participatory  development  approach,  wherein  the \nvalue chain stakeholders will be engaged in the design and implementation of subprojects.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe economic and financial analysis indicates the representative subprojects are viable, \nwith  the  following  economic  internal  rates  of  return:  Chepa  seed  farm,  16.0%;  minor  canal \nrehabilitation,  14.2%;  and  tubewell  irrigation,  15.3%.  The  benefits  measured  by  the  improved \ninfrastructure are a function of the increased productivity and production of certified seeds, and \nthe increased productivity and cropping intensity. The sensitivity analysis indicated that subproject \nbenefits remain robust (and the subproject economic internal rates of return well above 9%) when \nsubjected  to  varying  adverse  scenarios:  (i)  a  10%  increase  in  capital,  (ii)  a  10%  increase  in \noperating expenses, (iii) a 10% reduction in yield, (iv) a 10% reduction in output price, and (v) a \n10% reduction in benefit. The cash flow analysis indicates that the subprojects generate sufficient \ncash  flow  for  O&M,  affirming  financial  sustainability.  The  project  will  provide  O&M  technical \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nassistance for all stakeholders, including training programs for lead seed growers and farmers, \nand government extension agents. The government will assume primary responsibility for O&M \nof irrigation schemes and rural roads, with an estimated annual O&M requirement of $0.57 million \n(MOALI\u2019s average annual O&M budget is $23.31 million, and this amount is unlikely to constitute \nan excessive fiscal burden). Subprojects will be  selected by the readiness and commitment of \nbeneficiaries to assume O&M responsibility, and all subprojects will develop viable O&M plans. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n23. \nThe pre-mitigation financial management risk for the project is substantial given the low \ncapacity  for  accounting,  budgeting,  financial  reporting  and monitoring,  and  information  system \nuse;  and  low  quality  of  internal  and  external  audit  reports.  MOALI  will  ensure  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  develops  project-specific  accounting  systems  and  maintains financial \nrecords. Consolidated project financial statements prepared by MOALI will be audited annually \nby independent auditors acceptable to ADB. All procurement will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The overall procurement risk is high \ndue to limited experience in procuring civil works and services under ADB projects. International \nand national procurement specialists will assist the PMU and train MOALI staff on procurement. \nThe project will establish a website to disclose implementation progress, bid notifications and their \nresults, and a grievance mechanism. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time \nto  time)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOALI.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.      \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n24. \nThe project is classified general intervention. It will benefit at least 35,000 poor households \n(totaling  156,000  persons,  of  whom  80,000  are  women)  by  increasing  their  net  incomes  by  at \nleast 20%.26 It will promote inclusive economic growth and provide job opportunities and services. \nPoor households will be enabled to increase productivity through enhanced access to improved \nseeds,  water,  and  mechanization  services  through  the  agricultural  digital  finance  service. \nVulnerable households in townships will participate in civil works and post-harvest operations.   \n\nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  team \n25. \nprepared a gender action plan to promote women\u2019s views and their active participation in project \nactivities. Gender measures include (i) consultations with women farmers to identify their priorities \nand  needs,  (ii)  improved  access  to  financial  and  farm  extension  services,  and  (iii)  gender \nsensitization for stakeholders. Gender targets include (i) at least 40% of paid work in infrastructure \nconstruction and rehabilitation is for women; (ii) at least 30% of O&M jobs are for women; and \n(iii) 40% farmers trained in CSA, GAPs, and agribusiness skills are women. Other actions include \na detailed gender analysis of the value chains to inform the development of gender-responsive \nagribusiness policies, and awareness raising of women on land registration processes and land \nuse  rights.  Overall,  the  access  of  women  farmers  to  agricultural  inputs  and  capacity  will  be \nincreased, leading to improved livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and climate resilience. The \nPMU will be responsible for gender action plan implementation, monitoring and reporting. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n26. \ncategories are as follows.27 \n                                                \n26  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironment (category B). The project is expected to achieve significant environmental \n27. \nbenefits, including improved resilience and increased crop diversity. The project team conducted \nenvironmental  due  diligence  for  three  representative  subprojects.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination, including an environmental management plan, was prepared for a representative \nsubproject (minor canal rehabilitation in Pakokku) assessed as category B. These documents will \nserve as a guide for preparing the environmental management and monitoring plans for similar \nsubprojects.28  The  other  two  subprojects  have  been  classified  as  category  C  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nrapid  environmental  assessment  checklist,  and  environmental  codes  of  conduct  have  been \nprepared. An environmental assessment and review framework has been developed to guide the \nenvironmental  screening  and  categorization  of  subprojects  and  to  identify  potential  impacts.  It \nincludes an  environmental  code of conduct for  contractors  and  sets  out the  grievance redress \nmechanism  for  resolving  complaints  about  environmental  performance  as  well  as  public \nconsultation requirements. The framework was disclosed on the ADB website in March 2018 after \ngovernment's concurrence. Subprojects classified as category A will not be financed. Subprojects \nwill  be  screened  for  climate  risks  and  incorporate  risk  reduction  measures.  Semi-annual \nenvironmental safeguards monitoring reports will be submitted by the executing agency to ADB \nfor disclosure on ADB and project websites.  \n\n28. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Subproject screening and selection criteria will \nidentify  and reject  any  category  A  subprojects that  involve significant  involuntary  resettlement, \neconomic  displacement  or  involuntary  land  acquisition.  Due  diligence  conducted  for  three \nrepresentative subprojects showed that one of the subprojects requires acquisition of four square \nmeters  of  land.  None  would  result  in  any  physical  or  economic  displacement.  Therefore,  land \nacquisition and resettlement plans were not prepared for the representative subprojects. During \nproject preparation, some irrigation subprojects were identified that would require acquisition of \nsmall strips of land to accommodate improvement of tertiary canals. These small strips of land \nmay be acquired through (i) voluntary donation, (ii) negotiated settlement, or (iii) involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement. A rigorous due diligence procedure to verify that voluntary donations \nare legitimate has been included in the resettlement framework that will be used to further screen \nand  select  subprojects  during  implementation.29  Due  diligence  reports  for  subprojects  will  be \nupdated,  and  due  diligence  will  be  conducted  for  all  subprojects  identified  after  the  Board \napproval. If negotiated settlement is applied: (i) an external third party will be recruited to validate \nand document the process; (ii) the report with supporting documents will be submitted to ADB for \nconcurrence and no objection before any civil works commence; and (iii) if the owner of the site \nrefuses to sell, another site will be selected, and the same procedure followed. If negotiation fails \nand  expropriation  is  used,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  shall  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  sent  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence and disclosure prior to issuance of the bidding documents. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework  shall  be  used  to  conduct  a  social  safeguards  assessments  of  all \nsubprojects,  and  to  prepare  and  implement  resettlement  plans  where  needed  to  ensure \ncompliance with the Myanmar laws and regulations and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n\n29. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). There were no indigenous peoples or ethnic groups \nin the representative subprojects areas, hence no indigenous peoples plan was prepared. The \nfew ethnic households residing in the areas are assimilated into the mainstream Bamar society, \nuse the Myanmar official language, and pursue the same livelihoods as their Bamar neighbors. \nThe government prepared an ethnic group development framework to guide (i) identification of \ncircumstances that trigger indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguard requirements; and (ii) implementation \n\n                                                \n28 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nof future subprojects to ensure inclusiveness, consultation with, and participation of ethnic groups.  \n\n30.  Within 6 months of the date of project effectiveness and prior to commencement of civil \nworks,  the  project  will  establish  a  safeguards  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Building  on \nexperience  with  past  ADB  projects,  the  government  is  committed  to  and  has  the  capacity  to \nmanage  social  and  environmental  risks,  including  various  safeguard  frameworks  and  plans. \nAdequate  resources  were  allocated  to the  screening,  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring, \nand reporting of social and environmental safeguards, and associated capacity development. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n31. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFailure of the government to \nsustain policy reforms for \nagribusiness promotion \nWeak financial management \nregulatory systems and skills \nWeak procurement regulatory \nsystems and skills \nReduced budget allocations \nfor O&M leading to premature \ninfrastructure deterioration  \nCatastrophic climate change \nevents damage infrastructure \nor interrupt implementation \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MOALI = Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation; O&M = operation and \nmaintenance; PMU = project management unit; TPIU = township project implementation unit. \n\nMitigation Measures \nProject will assist MOALI to establish an agribusiness policy cell to promote \npublic\u2013private partnerships, identify how to access external markets, and \nstrengthen capacity to meet importing country safety and quality requirements.  \nProject will train PMU and TPIU staff on ADB accounting, auditing, and \ndisbursement procedures.
