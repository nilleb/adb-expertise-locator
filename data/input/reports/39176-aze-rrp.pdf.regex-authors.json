As a major mode of \npassenger and freight transport, roads play a pivotal role in the \nnational  economy.  They  also  enhance  regional  cooperation. \nHowever,  the  road  subsector  faces  four  main  development \nchallenges: (i) deteriorating infrastructure; (ii) poor safety record; \n(iii) inefficient crossborder and transit facilities; and (iv) limited \ninstitutional capacity at national, regional, and road agency levels. \n \nThe improvement of road infrastructure is one of the priorities in \ntwo state programs: (i) State Program on Poverty Reduction and \nEconomic Development, and (ii) State Program on Socioeconomic \nDevelopment of Regions. To implement these state programs, the \nMinistry of Transport has drafted a transport policy paper, followed \nby a transport sector development strategy. This work involved \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. The Transport Policy \nPaper and the ensuing Transport Sector Development Strategy \npaved the way for a road subsector road map. This highlights key \nproblems and causes for the execution of investment and non-\ninvestment changes. \n \n  The  Ministry  of  Transport  developed  a  Road  Network \nDevelopment Program for 2006\u20132015 (the Program) in July 2006. \nThe Program, which includes an investment component and a \nnon-investment component, will pave the way for the development \nof an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network. The \ninvestment  component  will  construct,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate \nabout  9,500  kilometers  (km)  of  124  priority  roads,  comprising \n3,570 km of 64 state roads and 5,928 km of 58 secondary roads. \nThe  non-investment  component  will  focus  on  priority  reforms, \nincluding development of regulations and operational procedures; \nencouragement of private sector participation in construction and \nmaintenance;  and  capacity  building  for  planning,  monitoring, \nevaluation, and reporting. The overall investment reaches $3.4 \nbillion over the next 10 years.  Most of this will be financed from \nthe  Government\u2019s  budget.  The  Government  has  also  sought \nexternal financing, with ADB and the World Bank as the main \nsources. ADB\u2019s share of the Program is 15%. \n ", "ii   \n  The first project (Project 1) of the Program has four components: \n(i) construction of about 59 km of a new expressway between \nMasalli and Astara on the southern corridor, (ii) rehabilitation of \nlocal  roads  in  the  project  area,  (iii)  installation  of  a  vehicle \nweighing  station  along  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and \nprocurement  of  road  maintenance  equipment,  and  (iv)  project \nsupport and capacity building for road network management. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government has requested ADB to help finance the Program \nFacility  through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) in the amount up to \nthe  equivalent  of  $500  million.  The  financing  will  be  provided \nprimarily  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR), \nsupplemented  by  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  MFF  will \ncomprise  multiple  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFR)  by  the  Government  and \nexecution of related loan agreements and other warranties and \nrepresentations. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  Framework  Financing \nAgreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  In  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment has submitted the first PFR for tranche 1 to ADB, \nrequesting a blend of two loans in a total amount of $200 million, \ncomprising an OCR loan of $190 million and a loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,535,000 ($10 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  the  Special  Funds  resources,  to  help \nfinance Project 1. The first PFR is presented to the Board together \nwith this report and the FFA. \n   \nRationale  Connectivity, both domestically and internationally, is the key to \nsustainable  development.  However,  about  70%  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nroad network is in poor condition, resulting in high transport costs, \nlong  delivery  times,  and  traffic  accidents.  This  constitutes  an \nimpediment to non-oil sector growth and poverty reduction. The \nroad  network  needs  to  be  developed.  This  requires  new \ninvestments  and  improved  maintenance.  The  subsector  also \nneeds  improved  safety  measures  and  standards,  and  \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments to facilitate crossborder trade and transit traffic. \n \nThe Government\u2019s total investment plan for the road network is \n$350 million a year during 2006\u20132015. The financing plan for such \ninvestments  relies  mainly  on  allocation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nbudget. Nevertheless, the Government has also opted for external \nfinancing. The World Bank and ADB are part of this financing \nplan. The Government is seeking money but also \u201cbest practice\u201d \nideas on project design, quality, standards, and reforms. As roads \nare identified as a strategically important area in ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy  and  program  update  for  Azerbaijan,  the  Program \nwarrants  ADB  support.  The  MFF  modality  will  allow  the \nGovernment (i) a greater degree of certainty on the financing plan, ", "  iii\n  and (ii) to borrow according to progress on project preparation. \nThe  MFF  will  also  contribute  to  establishing  a  long-term \npartnership between ADB and Azerbaijan. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Program  will  contribute  to  sustained  economic  and  social \ndevelopment in Azerbaijan. It will create a better trade logistic \ncorridor  and,  in  this  manner,  enhance  cooperation  with \nneighboring countries. The principal outcome of the Program will \nbe an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network, \nlinking  the  country  domestically  and  internationally.  The \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Program  will  result  in  (i) \nincreased mobility and accessibility to markets, jobs, and social \nservices; (ii) greater opportunities for private sector participation in \nbusiness activities; (iii) lower transport costs; (iv) increased trade \nflows and competitiveness; and (v) improved governance in the \nroad subsector. \n   \nInvestment Plan  The Program is estimated at $3.4 billion equivalent. The cost of \nProject  1,  including  taxes,  duties,  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, interest, and other charges, is estimated at $249 \nmillion equivalent. \n  Investment Program \n \nItem  Cost \n($ million) \nA.

The \nchairman of ARS will be responsible for overall supervision of the \nProgram.  The  recently  reorganized  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU)  in  ARS\u2014managing  the  projects  supported  by  ADB, \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and World \nBank\u2014will  handle  day-to-day  implementation  activities  of  the \nProgram.  The  PIU  will  also  undertake  such  functions  as  (i) \npreparation  of  PFRs,  (ii)  engagement  and  supervision  of \nconsultants and contractors, (iii) preparation of reports, and (iv) \nobtainment of approvals from ADB and the Government. The PIU \nis headed by the project director, who will report to the chairman \nof ARS. The PIU comprises ARS staff and a team of externally \ncontracted qualified technical, safeguards, financial, and support \nstaff to supplement resources in ARS. \n   \n  A steering committee will be established with representation from \nthe  Cabinet  of  Ministers\u2019  Office,  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, ARS, and \nthe PIU director among others. The steering committee will be \nchaired  by  a  deputy  minister  of  transport  and  will  meet \nsemiannually  to  ensure  interagency  coordination,  review \nimplementation progress, and provide approvals and guidance as \nnecessary. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  goods and services will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be \nfollowed for contracts with an amount above $3 million for civil \nworks, and at least $1 million for goods. The upper limit for a civil \nworks  contract  to  be  procured  through  national  competitive \nbidding procedures will be set at $3 million. \n \nADB approved advance contracting of civil works under Project 1 \non  22  June  2007.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project(s) from the MFF. \n \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for capacity development and \nproject implementation support. Key tasks include (i) construction \nsupervision, (ii) monitoring of project performance, (iii) preparation \nof  subsequent  projects,  and  (iv)  capacity  development.  The \ncapacity development component will involve the establishment of \na management unit comprising long-term and short-term advisors. \nThis team will define a detailed work plan; establish a modern and \nefficient management information system; and cater for planning, \nreforms,  technical,  fiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other \nmatters  connected  with  implementation\u2014including  reporting, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. Project 1  will require a  total  of  860 \n ", "vi   \n  person-months (182 international and 678 national) of services \nfrom consulting firms. This comprises (i) 766 person-months (146 \ninternational  and  620  national)  for  construction  supervision, \nproject monitoring and evaluation, and preparation of Project 2; (ii) \n70  person-months  (30  international  and  40  national)  for \nstrengthening  the  database  for  secondary  roads;  and  (iii)  24 \nperson-months (6 international and 18 national) for developing \nlegal and regulatory frameworks and operational procedures for \ntoll  roads.  Additional  consulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be \nprocured under subsequent projects. The consulting services will \nbe financed from ADB loans. ARS will select and engage the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n   \nEnvironment  Project  1  of  the  Program  is  classified  category  A.  An \nAssessment  environmental impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken, and the \nsummary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) circulated to \nthe Board and publicly disclosed through the ADB website on 16 \nJanuary  2007.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework for the Program is included in the SEIA. \n   \nInvestment Program  The Program will cut transport costs and bring benefits to road \nBenefits and  users, road construction companies, traders, and other people \nBeneficiaries  who  derive  income  from  expanded  road  traffic  and  trade  in \nAzerbaijan. The direct benefits from the improved road network \ninclude (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs; (ii) faster \nand  more  reliable  road  transport  services;  (iii)  reduced  traffic \naccidents; (iv) improved access to markets and social services; \nand (v) jobs and income created during implementation (i.e., use \nof local labor and construction materials) and after completion \n(i.e., roadside business activities). The direct benefits will initially \naccrue to vehicle owners and operators and road construction \ncompanies,  but  will  be  gradually  shared  with  passengers  and \nfreight customers through reduced bus fares and freight charges. \nWhile Azerbaijan is the major beneficiary, other countries in the \nregion  may  also  benefit  from  the  Program  through  efficient \nmovements of transit traffic via Azerbaijan. The indirect benefits of \nthe Program, which are expected to become tangible after the \ncompletion  of  Project  1,  include  (i)  improved  road  network \nmanagement, and (ii) increased business activities and jobs that \nhave forward or backward linkages to road network development. \n   ", "  vii\nRisks and Assumptions  The key assumptions underlying the Program are (i) continued \npolitical and macroeconomic stabilities in Azerbaijan, (ii) effective \nimplementation of the State Program on Poverty Reduction and \nEconomic  Development,  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment  to  regional  cooperation,  (iv)  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to implement the road map and the Program, and (v) \nadequate financing. \n \nRisks  to  the  Program  include  (i)  limited  coordination  among \ngovernment  agencies  during  implementation,  (ii)  rapid \ndeterioration  of  the  road  network  caused  by  weak  axle-load \ncontrols and insufficient funding for maintenance, (iii) delays in \npreparation and implementation of subsequent projects, and (iv) \ncost overruns caused by unexpected increases in prices of fuel \nand  raw  materials.  The  Government  has  taken  the  necessary \nmeasures to minimize these risks. The steering committee will \ncoordinate  work  of  the  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues  are \nresolved  promptly  and  that  these  agencies  extend  concerted \nsupport for the Program. The Government is committed, through \nthe Ministry of Transport, to enforce axle-load controls and further \nincrease funding for road maintenance. ADB, together with its \npartners, will provide continued support to ARS to strengthen its \ncapacity  for  road  network  management.  Adequate  consulting \nservices are provided to help prepare subsequent projects and \nmanage implementation, monitor performance, measure results, \nand report to ADB. Price contingency funds are included in the \nMFF to respond to unforeseen cost changes. \n \n ", "o o\n46  00\u2019E 50  00\u2019E\nREPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\nR U S S I A N\nBalaken ROAD NETWORK \nG E O R G I A Zagatala F E D E R A T I O N mur River Khudat DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nSa\nGusar Khachmaz\nGakh\nGuba\nC A S P I A N     S E A\nSheki\nDevechi\nAgstafa\nGazakh Shamkir Siazan\no Reservoir Oghuz o\n41  00\u2019N Tovuz Gabala 41  00\u2019N\nGovla Shamkir NabiagalyMingechevir Reservoir Ismailly Khyzy\nMingechevir\nGanja\nShamakhy Sumgayit\nYevlakh\nGeranboy Agdash Goychay Maraza\nGadabey Khanlar Agshu Pirallahl\nDashkesan Kur  Ujar Khyrdalan Pirallahl Island\nTerter BardaRiver Kyurdamir BAKU Chilov Island\nSangachal\nAgdere Zardab\nA R M E N I A\nHajiqabul\nKelbajar Agjabedi Sabirabad Alyat\nSarisu Lake Ali-Bayramli\nAgdam\nKhojaly Imishli Saatly K\nKhankendi Beilagan ur R N\nHeidarabad Shusha Khojavend iver\nLachin\nSharur Fuzuli\nAraz River Araz River BilasuvarSalyan 0 2K5ilometer5s0 75\nShahbuz Gubadly Neftchala\nQivraq Jebrail\nNAKHCHIVAN National Capital\nAraz Reservoir AUTONOMOUS Jalilabad City/Town\nNakhchivan REPUBLIC\nBabek Zangilan Masalli Project Road\no o\n39  00\u2019N Julfa National Road 39  00\u2019N\nOrdubad Other Road\nAraz River Yardymly Railway\nLenkaran River\nLerik\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nI R A N\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0 Astara\n7\n-0\n4\n11 H 46o  00\u2019E 50o  00\u2019E\nR", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  for  the  Road  Network \nDevelopment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  transport  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  the  national  economy, \naccounting for around 6% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005. It also \nenhances regional cooperation. The transport sector comprises railways, roads, civil aviation, \nmaritime transport, and pipelines. Roads are the dominant mode of passenger transport (74% of \ntotal passengers in passenger kilometers [km]) and the second major mode of freight transport \n(28% of total freight volume in ton-km). While freight is mainly carried by railways, the volume \ncarried by roads rose by 1,330% from 1995 to 2005, more rapidly than other modes of transport. \nWith continued economic growth in Azerbaijan, the share of roads in total transport is projected \nto increase, enhancing the road subsector\u2019s importance to the country\u2019s development. Detailed \nanalysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The road network comprises around 25,000 km of roads, including 4,498 km in the \nNagorno-Karabakh area and 2,078 km in the Nakhchivan Autonomous area.1 It consists of  \n7,016 km of state roads and 17,997 km of municipal roads. The network is dominated by two \nmajor highways: (i) the east\u2013west highway linking the country\u2019s capital, Baku, to the Georgian \nborder; and (ii) the north\u2013south highway running from the Russian border to the Iranian border \nthrough Baku. About 51% of the roads are paved and 49% gravel. However, about 70% of the \nroad network is in poor condition and requires rehabilitation. \n \n4.  The motorization rate is low by international standards. The vehicle fleet numbered \nabout 612,000 in 2005, including 480,000 cars, 91,000 trucks, and 27,000 buses. This was \nequivalent to 73 vehicles per 1,000 people. About 70% of trucks and 50% of buses have been \noperating for over 10 years, with an inevitable effect on the level of service and costs of \noperation. The vehicle fleet grew rapidly at an annual rate of 10% in recent years, and this trend \nis projected to gain momentum with continued economic growth in the country. \n \n5.  After a gradual decline during 1994\u20132000, the number of road traffic accidents, fatalities, \nand injuries has risen sharply at an annual rate of 12.5% since 2001. There were 3,179 road \ntraffic accidents in 2005, resulting in 1,065 fatalities and 3,668 injuries. The fatality rate in 2005 \nwas  174  per  10,000  vehicles,  much  higher  than  that  in  European  countries.  Pedestrians \naccounted for around 60% of casualties in urban areas, while passengers made up about 50% \nof the casualties in rural areas. \n \n6.  The road transport service market is almost fully liberalized. The private sector plays a \nkey role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 95% of freight and \npassenger traffic. The state-owned road transport operators were largely privatized and foreign \nroad transport operators are allowed to set up business. Freight charges and bus fares for \ndomestic road transport are determined based on market conditions, although the Government \n                                                 \n1  Nakhchivan is separated from central Azerbaijan by Armenia. Central Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan are connected \nby air transport or road transport via Iran. ", "2     \nis setting up prices for urban passenger transport, and tariffs for crossborder and transit traffic. \nThe Government has recently introduced vehicle licensing to enhance vehicle axle-load controls \nand improve road safety. \n \n7.  The  transport  sector  is  managed  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport.  The  road  network \n(excluding Nakhchivan)2 is under the responsibility of the AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock \nCompany  (ARS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  which  was  reorganized  from  the  Road \nTransport  Service  Department  in  March  2007.  The  Government  made  efforts  to  improve \nmanagement in the road subsector. An amendment to the Road Law is being reviewed at the \nCabinet of Ministers and a corporate plan for ARS was developed. ARS\u2019s budget increased \nfrom $15.7 million in 2003 to $106.8 million in 2006. With the abolishment of the Road Fund in \n2001,  the  road  subsector  was  financed  primarily  from  the  Government\u2019s  budget.  The \nGovernment decided to restore the Road Fund in January 2007, but it is too early to assess its \nperformance.  The  overall  institutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector  is  limited  and  needs \nstrengthening. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n \n8.  Like other sectors in Azerbaijan, the road subsector is in transition from a centrally \nplanned to a market-oriented system. The subsector faces four major development challenges: \n(i) deteriorating infrastructure, (ii) poor safety record, (iii) inefficient crossborder and transit \nfacilities, and (iv) limited institutional capacity at national, regional, and road agency levels. \n \n9.  Road Network Infrastructure. The road network was primarily developed under the \nformer Soviet Union, and does not meet adequately the need of the fast expanding economy. \nThere are only 191 km of 4-lane highways, and most roads are in poor condition due to two \nreasons. First, despite an increase from $5.7 million in 2001 to $55.5 million in 2006, funding for \nroad maintenance remains inadequate, accounting for less than 0.5% of GDP. As a result, a \nlarge part of the road network deteriorated rapidly and became non-maintainable. Second, due \nto weak enforcement of vehicle axle load regulations, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent, \ncausing rapid pavement deterioration. Surveys showed that about 20% of 4-axle trucks, 5-axle \ntrucks,  and  buses  exceeded  the  axle-load  limit.  The  poor  road  conditions  results  in  high \ntransport costs, long delivery times, and traffic accidents, thus constituting an impediment to \nnon-oil sector growth and poverty reduction. The road network needs to be developed so as to \nspur growth of trade, investment, and tourism in Azerbaijan. \n \n10.  Road Safety. Road safety is an acute problem, reflected by a sharp rise in the number \nof traffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries since 2001. The current fatality rate is about 10 times \nthat in the European countries, causing significant economic and human losses. While there are \nseveral causes of traffic accidents, the inadequacy of the road network with poor conditions is a \nprimary  cause.  Curves  and  superelevation  are  inappropriately  designed,  pavements  are \ndeteriorating,  and  safety  furniture  is  lacking  on  many  roads.  Other  causes  of  road  traffic \naccidents include weak enforcement of safety regulations, intoxicated driving, and inadequate \ndriver education. With the rapid expansion of vehicle fleet, road traffic accidents are likely to \nincrease in the future, unless remedial action is undertaken. Road safety should be improved \nthrough road network development and increased public safety awareness. \n \n                                                 \n2  Nakhchivan has its own road agency, Nakhavtoyol. ", "  3 \n11.  Crossborder and Transit Transport. Azerbaijan\u2019s geographic location in the southern \nCaucasus makes its road network crucial to regional transport and trade. The east\u2013west and \nnorth\u2013south highways form part of the Asian highway network3 connecting Iran and the Russian \nFederation, as well as Georgia and Turkey to Central Asia. Azerbaijan is a signatory to a \nnumber  of  international  transport  agreements  and  conventions.  However,  crossborder  and \ntransit road transport remains inefficient. Surveys showed that 80% of firms experienced delays \nof 1\u22123 days in crossing the borders of Azerbaijan.4 The major causes include poor road \nconditions, inadequate crossborder facilities, and nonharmonized crossborder procedures with \nneighboring countries. These barriers severely hinder crossborder and transit traffic, which \naccounts only for around 5% of the total traffic on the east\u2013west and southern highways. \nDevelopment of an integrated and efficient road network will facilitate crossborder and transit \ntraffic, and contribute to regional cooperation and integration. \n \n12.  Institutional  Capacity.  Despite  some  progress  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms, \ninstitutional capacity in the road subsector remains limited. This is reflected by (i) lack of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  managing  the  road  network;  (ii)  weak  enforcement  of  some \nexisting regulations such as those relating to vehicle axle-load controls and road safety; (iii) \nweak financial management; (iv) lack of private sector participation in road maintenance; and (v) \nlimited staff experience in management of road projects. ARS received World Bank assistance \nfor institutional strengthening during 2003\u20132005. As the first step toward sound governance in \nthe road subsector, World Bank assistance produced a number of recommendations. Further \nexternal  assistance  is  needed  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  in  the  subsector  by \nsupporting implementation of these recommendations. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n13.  An inadequate and inefficient road network is a bottleneck to sustained economic growth \nand rapid poverty reduction. Despite recent strong growth driven by the oil sector, oil output in \nAzerbaijan is projected to reach peak around 2015, unless new oil reserves can be found. Thus, \nnon-oil sector development is crucial to the country. Good transport infrastructure contributes \nsignificantly  to  non-oil sector  development.  In  recognition  of  this,  the  Government  has  set \ndevelopment of road infrastructure as one of the priorities in two state programs: (i) State \nProgram on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) for 2003\u22122005,5 and (ii) \nState Program on Socioeconomic Development of Regions for 2004\u20132008.6 The Government is \nnow preparing a follow-up 10-year poverty reduction strategy, based on achievement of country-\nspecific targets linked to the Millennium Development Goals. In support of implementing these \nprograms, the Ministry of Transport drafted a transport policy paper, followed by a transport \nsector development strategy developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.7 The \ndraft Transport Policy Paper and the ensuing Transport Sector Development Strategy paved the \nway for a road subsector roadmap. This highlights key problems and causes for the execution of \ninvestment and non-investment changes. Both documents identified road network development \nas a high priority over the medium term. Specifically, the documents set the following major \n                                                 \n3  The concept of the Asian highway network was developed with assistance of the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Twenty-seven Asian countries including Azerbaijan have signed the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network. \n4  World Bank. 2002.

The Ministry of Transport developed a Road Network Development Program for 2006\u2013\n2015 (the Program) in July 2006,8 with the objective of developing an adequate, efficient, safe, \nand sustainable road network in support of the country\u2019s economic and social development. The \nProgram includes an investment component and a non-investment component. The investment \ncomponent will construct, upgrade, and rehabilitate approximately 9,500 km of 124 priority \nroads, comprising 3,570 km of 64 state roads and 5,928 km of 58 secondary roads. The non-\ninvestment component will focus on priority reforms, including the development of regulations \nand operational procedures; encouragement of private sector participation in construction and \nmaintenance; and capacity building for planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The \noverall investment reaches $3.4 billion over the 10-year period. Most of this will be financed \nfrom the Government\u2019s budget. The Government has also sought external financing, with ADB \nand the World Bank as the main sources. The road subsector road map and investment plan for \n2006\u20132015 are in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  External Assistance \n \n15.  The road subsector has received external assistance since the mid-1990s. The major \nsources of external assistance are ADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD),  European  Union,  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB),  and  World  Bank.  Details  of \nexternal assistance to the road subsector are in Appendix 4. In line with the Government\u2019s \npriority, external assistance focused on improving the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. \nCivil works on the majority of the east\u2013west highway were either completed or underway. The \nAlyat\u2013Hajigabul section was improved in 2003 with funding from IsDB and the Kuwait Fund for \nArab Economic Development, and the Ganja\u2013Qazakh section was reconstructed with World \nBank  assistance  in  2006.  The  sections  expected  to  be  improved  by  2008  include  (i)  the \nHajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir  section  with  EBRD  assistance,  and  (ii)  the  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border \nsection and Ganja bypass with ADB assistance. EBRD and the Czech Export Bank are helping \nreconstruct the northern highway from Baku to the Russian border, while the World Bank and \nADB will jointly develop the southern highway between Alyat and Astara. The World Bank, ADB, \nEBRD,  and  European  Union  have  provided  technical  assistance  for  feasibility  studies  and \ncapacity development. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Sector Operations \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  strategy  for  Azerbaijan9  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  raise  living \nstandards in a sustainable manner. Given Azerbaijan\u2019s geographic location, the latest country \nstrategy and program update10 identifies roads as a priority area for ADB assistance. ADB \nassistance to roads focuses on improving the main highways connecting Azerbaijan to its \nneighboring countries, supporting policy reform, and promoting capacity development. The first \nlending  project,  approved  in  2005,  aimed  to  rehabilitate  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013\n                                                 \n8  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006.

ADB \nassisted the Government in developing a transport sector development strategy during 2005\u2013\n2006,12 which will guide ADB\u2019s future assistance to the transport sector. The Program, which \nwas prepared with ADB technical assistance approved in November 2005,13 is consistent with \nADB\u2019s assistance strategy for Azerbaijan. \n \n17.  ADB has approved two loans and three TA projects to the transport sector, with a total \namount of around $53.6 million. The portfolio performance in the transport sector is better than \nthe country average. The East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project is being implemented as \nscheduled. The detailed design has been completed and bidding documents have been issued. \nOf  the  two  completed  TA  projects,  the  TA  completion  report  for  the  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy14 has been prepared and the TA was rated fully satisfactory. \n \n5.  Lessons \n \n18.  ADB operations in Azerbaijan are relatively new\u2014five loans have been approved to \ndate.15 Thus, substantive lessons cannot be drawn from previous projects. Nevertheless, the \nProgram was designed with careful consideration of the lessons learned from operations of ADB \nand development partners in Azerbaijan and similar ADB projects in other transition economies. \nThe following five lessons need to be highlighted. First, each project and subproject financed \nunder the MFF was, and will be, carefully evaluated based on in-depth technical, economic, \nenvironmental, and social (including land acquisition and resettlement) assessments to ensure \nquality  at  entry.  Second,  advance  contracting  was  undertaken  to  expedite  project \nimplementation. Third, road infrastructure investments will be accompanied by support for policy \nreform and institutional strengthening to maximize the development impact and benefits of \ninvestment. Fourth, the Program will improve both road infrastructure and crossborder facilities, \nto the extent possible, to complement efforts for eliminating physical and nonphysical barriers to \ncrossborder  traffic.  Fifth,  the  Program  was  designed  in  collaboration  with  development \npartners\u2014particularly the World Bank, which is helping construct an expressway between Alyat \nand Masalli on the same southern corridor. \n \n6.  Rationale for ADB Support for the Program \n \n19.  Connectivity,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  is  the  key  to  sustainable \ndevelopment in Azerbaijan. However, about 70% of the country\u2019s road network is in poor \ncondition,  resulting  in  high  transport  costs,  long  delivery  times,  and  traffic  accidents.

The road network \nneeds  to  be  developed.  This  requires  new  investments  and  improved  maintenance.  The \nsubsector also needs improved road safety measures and standards, and \u201csoft\u201d investments to \nfacilitate crossborder trade and transit traffic. \n \n20.  The Government\u2019s total investment plan for the road network is $350 million a year \nduring 2006\u20132015. The financing plan for such investments relies mainly on allocation of the \nGovernment\u2019s budget. Nevertheless, the Government has also opted for external financing. The \nWorld Bank and ADB are part of this financing plan. The Government is seeking money but also \n\u201cbest practice\u201d ideas on project design, quality, standards, and reforms. As roads are identified \nas a strategically important area in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for Azerbaijan, \nthe Program warrants ADB support. The MFF modality will allow the Government (i) a greater \ndegree of certainty on the financing plan, and (ii) to borrow according to progress on project \npreparation. The MFF will also contribute to establishing a long-term partnership between ADB \nand Azerbaijan. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  sustained  economic  and  social  development  in \nAzerbaijan. It will create a better trade logistic corridor and, in this manner, enhance cooperation \nwith neighboring countries. It is an integral part of Azerbaijan\u2019s transport sector development \nstrategy. The outcome of the Program will be an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road \nnetwork, linking Azerbaijan domestically and internationally. Successful implementation of the \nProgram  will  result  in  (i)  increased  mobility  and  accessibility  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social \nservices; (ii) greater opportunities for private sector participation in business activities; (iii) lower \ntransport costs; (iv) increased trade flows and competitiveness; and (v) improved governance in \nthe road subsector. \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  The outputs of the Program will be (i) an improved national road network; and (ii) \neffective and efficient management of the road network. The outputs will be achieved from two \ncomponents: (i) road infrastructure development, and (ii) road network management capacity \ndevelopment.  The  road  infrastructure  development  component  will  cover  construction, \nupgrading, or rehabilitation of the priority roads. The roads to be financed under the MFF have \nbeen, or will be, selected based on Azerbaijan\u2019s Transport Sector Development Strategy and \neconomic,  social,  environmental,  and  technical  assessments.  The  selection  criteria  and \napproval process for projects and subprojects to be financed under the MFF are in Appendix 5. \nThe road network management capacity development component will focus on priority reforms, \nincluding the development of regulations and operational procedures; encouragement of private \nsector participation in building and maintenance; and capacity building for planning, monitoring, \nevaluation, and reporting. \n \n1.  Outputs for Project 1 \n \n23.  The outputs of the first project (Project 1) of the Program will be (i) an improved southern \nroad transport corridor, and (ii) enhanced management capacity in ARS. These will be achieved \nthrough four components: (i) construction of a new expressway between Masalli and Astara, (ii) \nrehabilitation of local roads in the project area, (iii) installation of a vehicle weighing station ", "  7 \nalong the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway and procurement of road maintenance equipment, and \n(iv) project support and capacity building. Each of these components is briefed below. \n \n24.  Construction of the Masalli\u2013Astara Expressway. Project 1 will construct about 59 km \nof a new 4-lane expressway between Masalli and Astara on the border with Iran on the southern \ncorridor\u2014the  southern  segment  of  the  new  expressway  between  Alyat  and  Astara.  The \nexpressway  will  comprise  dual  carriageways  with  a  10-meter-wide  pavement  on  each \ncarriageway and 3-meter outer shoulders, three interchanges, and 26 bridges. It conforms to \nAzerbaijan\u2019s standards for a category I road, and is designed for a speed of 120 km per hour \nand with cumulative 13-ton vehicle axle loading. Activities comprise (i) civil works, and (ii) land \nacquisition and resettlement. \n \n25.  Rehabilitation of Local Roads. Project 1 will rehabilitate local roads totaling about 120 \nkm  in  the  project  area  to  enhance  access  to  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  for  local \ncommunities. Each of the local roads conforms to Azerbaijan\u2019s standards for a category III road, \nwith two lanes of a 5\u20138 meter wide pavement. These local roads were selected in consultations \nwith ARS and local stakeholders, and based on road conditions. \n \n26.  Installation of a Vehicle Weighing Station and Procurement of Road Maintenance \nEquipment. Project 1 will install a vehicle weighing station along the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway \nand procure road maintenance equipment. This aims to increase the sustainability of investment \nin  the  expressway  through  the  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  controls  and  adequate \nmaintenance. \n \n27.  Project Support and Capacity Building for Road Network Management. Project 1 \nwill  provide  support  for  (i)  implementation  of  Project  1,  including  construction  supervision, \nproject management, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii) preparation of Project 2 (e.g., feasibility \nstudies and due diligence); and (iii) independent external financial auditing. This component will \nalso help build the capacity of ARS for road network management, including (i) developing a \ndatabase  for  secondary  roads,16  and  (ii)  developing  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \noperational procedures for toll roads. This non-investment component will be implemented \nprimarily through consulting services. \n \n28.  Project 1 adopts a sector lending modality, comprising Subproject A\u2014a core subproject \ncovering  the  section  km  0\u2013km  22.1  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  and  2  non-core \nsubprojects: (i) Subproject B (section km 22.1\u2013km 45.1 of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway), and \n(ii)  Subproject  C  (section  km  45.1\u2013km  58.6  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway).  Under \nSubproject A the financing will also be provided for rehabilitation of local roads, procurement of \nroad maintenance equipment, installation of a vehicle weighing station along the Masalli\u2013Astara \nexpressway, project support, and capacity building. \n \n2.  Outputs for Project 2 \n \n29.  The  outputs  of  Project  2  under  the  Program  will  be  produced  from  three  tentative \ncomponents: (i) upgrading of a 2-lane road between Ganja and Qazakh on the east\u2013west \ncorridor to a 4-lane expressway (about 94 km), (ii) development of crossborder infrastructure \nand facilities in Astara (provided that the Government has decided the location of the new \nborder  crossing  point),  and  (iii)  project  support  and  capacity  building  for  road  network \n                                                 \n16 The World Bank is assisting ARS in strengthening the database for state roads. \n ", "8     \nmanagement.  The  outputs  and  components  for  Project  2  will  be  finalized  during  the \nimplementation of Project 1. \n \nC.  Special Features \n30.  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  regional \ncooperation and integration by improving Azerbaijan\u2019s segment of the trans-Caucasian road \nnetwork and border facilities in Astara. The southern and east\u2013west highways form part of the \nAsian highway network and have the potential to become important corridors for transit traffic \nbetween Asia and Europe. Successful implementation of the Program will connect Azerbaijan \nclosely with neighboring countries, increasing regional traffic and trade. \n \n31.  Capacity  Development.  The  Program  includes  a  strong  component  on  capacity \ndevelopment of road network management, which will address issues on road maintenance, \nroad safety, vehicle axle load controls, and private sector participation. Given a lack of reliable \nroad information, Project 1 will develop a database for secondary roads, which will help ARS to \nbetter plan and undertake road maintenance operations. Project 1 will also develop legal and \nregulatory frameworks and operational procedures for toll roads, which will create an enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation in road construction, operation, and maintenance. \nCapacity building assistance will continue under subsequent projects. This will supplement \nphysical investments to achieve sustained development in the road subsector. \n \n32.  Aid  Coordination.  The  Program  was  prepared,  and  will  be  implemented,  in  close \ncoordination with the World Bank, which is also providing assistance to the road subsector and \ncofinancing, on a parallel basis, construction of an expressway between Alyat and Masalli\u2014the \nnorthern section of the new expressway between Alyat and Astara. During project processing, \nADB\u2019s project team frequently consulted with World Bank counterparts on issues such as policy \nreforms and capacity development in the road subsector, road alignments, technical standards, \ntraffic projection, safeguards, and project implementation. The ADB-funded project preparatory \ntechnical assistance consultant worked with the consultant engaged under the World Bank \nproject.  The  recently  reorganized  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  ARS  will  manage \nimplementation of the Program, together with the World Bank-assisted highway II project. The \naid  coordination  during  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  Program  will  improve  the \neffectiveness  of  external  assistance,  mitigate  the  Government\u2019s  administrative  resources \nconstraints, and contribute to enhancing the capacity of ARS for project management. \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n33.  The total cost of the Program is estimated at around $3.4 billion equivalent. The total \ncost of Project 1\u2014including taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges\u2014is estimated at $249 million equivalent.

Financing Plan \n34.  The Government has requested ADB to help finance the Program through the MFF in \nthe amount up to the equivalent of $500 million. The financing will be provided in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy,17 primarily from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and supplemented \nby its Special Funds resources. The MFF will comprise multiple loans, subject to the submission \nof related periodic financing requests (PFR) by the Government and execution of related loan \nagreements and other warranties and representations. The Government has entered into a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The maximum amount of financing from OCR \nwill be $490 million equivalent and such financing will follow the provisions of the Ordinary \nOperations Loan Regulations applicable to a London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nloans, subject to modifications that may be included under individual loan agreements. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nmaximum amount of financing from the Special Funds resources will be $10 million equivalent \nand  such  financing  will  follow  the  provisions  of  the  Special  Operations  Loan  Regulations, \nsubject to modifications that may be included under individual loan agreements. \n \n35.  In accordance with the FFA, the Government has submitted the first PFR for tranche 1 to \nADB, requesting a blend of two loans in a total amount of $200 million, comprising an OCR loan \nof $190 million and a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,535,000 \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program and Project Management \n36.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  ARS  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency.  ARS  has  been  implementing  the  ADB-funded  East\u2013West  Highway \nImprovement Project and has developed required capacity to manage the implementation of the \nProgram with support of ADB and other partners. The chairman of ARS will be responsible for \noverall  supervision  of  the  Program.  The  recently  reorganized  PIU  in  ARS\u2014managing \nimplementation of road projects supported by ADB, EBRD, and World Bank\u2014will handle day-to-\nday implementation activities of the Program. The PIU will also undertake periodic functions \nsuch  as  (i)  preparation  of  PFRs,  (ii)  engagement  and  supervision  of  consultants  and  \ncontractors, (iii) preparation of reports, and (iv) obtainment of approvals from ADB and the \nGovernment. The PIU is headed by the project director, who will report to the chairman of ARS. \nThe  PIU  comprises  ARS  staff  and  a  team  of  externally  contracted  qualified  technical, \nsafeguards, financial, and support staff to supplement resources in ARS. \n ", "  11 \n37.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  representation  from  the  Cabinet  of \nMinisters\u2019 Office, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, \nARS, and the PIU director among others. The steering committee will be chaired by a deputy \nminister of transport and will meet at least semiannually to ensure interagency coordination, \nreview implementation progress, and provide approvals and guidance as necessary. A program \nand project management organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n38.  ADB will finance staff, equipment, and operating expenses in the PIU for implementing \nthe Program from Special Funds resources. Specifically, ADB will finance the salaries of a \nhighway engineer, procurement specialist, financial specialist, and administrative assistant, as \nwell as related office equipment and supplies. ADB financing for PIU costs is justifiable because \n(i) limited capacity of ARS for project implementation needs to be complemented, and (ii) this is \nan  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity  development  in  the  road  subsector.  The \nGovernment has given assurance that, upon completion of the Program, PIU staff will be \nintegrated into ARS to implement future projects. \n \n2.  Project Preparation and Appraisal \n39.  The Program will follow MFF implementation procedures. For Project 1, pre-construction \nactivities  have  been  completed,  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  civil  works.  For  subsequent  projects,  ARS,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nprogram support consultants, will prepare (i) the project report, including technical, economic, \nenvironmental, and social assessments; and (ii) a PFR for each project. The project report will \nbe prepared in accordance with the criteria and procedures stated in Schedule 4 of the FFA, \nand other related requirements of the Government and ADB. After appraising each project for \ntechnical and economic feasibility and compliance with safeguard requirements, ARS will submit \nto ADB, through the Ministry of Transport, a summary appraisal report in the format specified in \nthe Program administration memorandum, and the draft PFR. ADB will then undertake due \ndiligence in accordance with its relevant policies and procedures, and approve ARS\u2019s appraisal, \nsubject to any amendments. If required by ADB, ARS will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB \nfor  approval  on  or  before  the  due  date  of  the  PFR.  Meanwhile,  ARS  will  make  advance \ncontracting as approved by ADB to expedite project implementation. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n40.  The Program will be implemented over 7 years, to be completed at the end of 2014. \nProject 1 will be implemented over 3 years, with estimated completion by 31 December 2009. \nARS will prepare detailed implementation schedules for subsequent projects. An indicative \nimplementation schedule for the Program and a detailed implementation schedule for Project 1 \nare in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Procurement \n41.  ADB-financed  goods and services will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding procedures \nwill be followed for contracts with an amount above $3 million for civil works and at least $1 \nmillion for goods. The upper limit for a civil works contract to be procured through national \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be set at $3 million. National competitive bidding will be \nconducted under Azerbaijan\u2019s legislation on state procurement, subject to modification and \nclarification set forth in the individual loan agreements. A procurement plan for the Program is in \nAppendix 9. \n ", "12    \n \n42.  ADB approved advance contracting of civil works under Project 1 on 22 June 2007. The \nGovernment was advised that ADB approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project(s) from the MFF. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n43.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  capacity  development  and  project \nimplementation support. Key tasks include (i) construction supervision, (ii) monitoring of project \nperformance,  (iii)  preparation  of  subsequent  projects,  and  (iv)  capacity  development.  The \ncapacity  development  component  will  involve  the  establishment  of  a  management  unit \ncomprising  long-term  and  short-term  advisors.  This  team  will  define  a  detailed  work  plan; \nestablish  a  modern  and  efficient  management  information  system;  and  cater  for  planning, \nreforms,  technical,  fiduciary  oversight,  safeguards,  and  other  matters  connected  with \nimplementation\u2014including reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n44.  Project 1 will require a total of 860 person-months (182 international and 678 national) of \nservices from consulting firms. This comprises (i) 766 person-months (146 international and 620 \nnational) for construction supervision, project monitoring and evaluation, and preparation of \nProject  2;  (ii)  70  person-months  (30  international  and  40  national)  for  strengthening  the \ndatabase for secondary roads; and (iii) 24 person-months (6 international and 18 national) for \ndeveloping legal and regulatory frameworks and operational procedures for toll roads. Outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendixes A, B, and C. Additional \nconsulting services, if necessary, will be procured under subsequent projects. The consulting \nservices will be financed from ADB loans. ARS will select and engage the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project(s) under the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of ARS and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n46.  The Government and ARS agreed to take additional measures to improve governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency  under  the  MFF.  These  measures  include  (i)  independent \nexternal auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial statements; (ii) decisions of all \nprocurement-related matters by the Tendering Committee, which comprises representatives of \nthe Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, and the State \nProcurement Agency (as observer) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines;  (iii) \nverification of contractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervision consultant in accordance with \ncontract specifications; and (iv) timely disclosure of information on selection of consultants and \ncontractors through local newspapers. \n ", "  13 \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The last disbursements under the MFF will be \nmade by 31 December 2014. To reduce cash flow difficulties in ARS and facilitate project \nimplementation,  the  imprest  account  procedures  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook will be followed. An imprest account will be established at the central bank or a \ncommercial bank in Azerbaijan acceptable to ADB after the loan effectiveness, and will be \nliquidated and replenished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The total \nadvance will not exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed \nthrough the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of the amount of the loan from \nSpecial Funds resources, whichever is lower. For simplified documentation, the statement of \nexpenditure procedures, as described in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, will be followed to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nof $100,000 equivalent and below. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  The Ministry of Transport and ARS agreed to adhere to sound financial management \nrequirements during implementation of the Program. The Ministry of Transport and ARS will \nmaintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the (i) goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, (ii) financing resources received, (iii) expenses incurred on the \ncomponents of each project, and (iv) use of counterpart funds. ARS will engage independent \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB to audit project accounts and financial statements annually, \nand will arrange a periodic or annual audit of statement of expenditure transactions. ARS will \nsubmit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  audited  annual  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements as well as the auditor\u2019s report in English within 6 months of the end of each fiscal \nyear during implementation. ARS was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of \naudited annual project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements \nof ADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n49.  ARS will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports for individual projects, \nwhich will include (i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting period, (ii) \nchanges in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) \nactivities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. ARS will prepare and submit to ADB a \nproject completion report within 3 months of the completion of each project, and a program \ncompletion report after completion of all projects under the Program. \n \n9.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  A set of targets and indicators for monitoring and evaluation of program performance \nwere discussed with the Government during fact-finding (key performance targets and indicators \nare provided in Appendix 1). ARS will (i) engage consultants for monitoring and evaluation by \nDecember 2007; (ii) collect additional data from relevant agencies, including local governments \nand statistics bureaus, to measure the performance indicators at inception, completion, and 3 \nyears after completion of each project and the Program; and (iii) report to ADB key findings on a \nquarterly basis. ARS, with the assistance of the PIU and the supervision consultant, will monitor \nand evaluate program impacts to ensure that the program facilities are managed effectively and \nthe program benefits maximized. ADB Management will prepare periodic reports to inform the \nBoard of overall progress. A Board information report will be submitted annually, and progress \nreports will be submitted to inform the Board of the approval of loans for subsequent projects. \n ", "14    \n \n10.  Reviews \n51.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the loan approval for each project, \nand a review mission annually. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm \nreview of Project 1 in 2008 and a midterm review of the Program in 2010. The timing of midterm \nreviews of subsequent projects will be agreed during the appraisal of each project. The midterm \nreviews will focus on (i) program impacts; (ii) implementation progress; (iii) road subsector \nreform  and  performance;  (iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors;  (v)  status  of \ncompliance with the covenants stipulated in the FFA and individual loan agreements; and (vi) \nthe need for any midcourse changes in the scope or schedule of the Program to ensure full \nachievement of its impact. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n52.  The Program will bring benefits to road users, road construction companies, traders, and \nother people who derive income from expanded road traffic and trade in Azerbaijan. The direct \nbenefits from the improved road network include (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs, \n(ii) faster and more reliable road transport services, (iii) reduced traffic accidents, (iv) improved \naccess to markets and social services, and (v) jobs and income created during implementation \n(i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) and after completion (i.e., roadside business \nactivities). The direct benefits will initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators and road \nconstruction companies, but will be gradually shared with passengers and freight customers \nthrough reduced bus fares and freight charges. While Azerbaijan is the major beneficiary, other \ncountries in the region may also benefit from the Program through efficient movements of transit \ntraffic via Azerbaijan. The indirect benefits of the Program, which are expected to become \ntangible after the completion of Project 1, include (i) improved road network management, and \n(ii) increased business activities and jobs that have forward or backward linkages to road \nnetwork development. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n53.  Economic  analysis  of  all  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.18 The economic \nanalysis for Project 1 is in Appendix 10. It was based on a comparison of with- and without-\nproject cases and covers a period of 20 years (2008\u20132027), comprising 2 years of construction \nand 18 years of operation. On the basis of projected growth of GDP per capita and population, \nas  well  as  the  estimated  income  elasticity  of  demand  in  Azerbaijan,  traffic  on  the  new \nexpressway between Masalli and Astara was projected to grow at 8.3% annually, with average \ndaily traffic increasing from about 4,000 vehicles in 2008 to 20,300 vehicles in 2027. \n \n54.  The major benefits of Project 1 are savings on vehicle operating costs and travel time, \nand reduced traffic accidents caused by improved road conditions and the shorter length of the \nnew  expressway  after  project  completion.  The  new  expressway  will  have  an  average \ninternational roughness index (IRI) value of 2.5, compared with the IRI value of 11.0 for the \nexisting road between Masalli and Astara in 2006. Savings on vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime were calculated using the highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM4) model, which shows \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "  15 \nthat Project 1 will lead to savings on vehicle operating costs per km of 11% for cars, 14% for \nheavy trucks, and around 20% for articulated trucks. Project 1 will also result in savings on \ntravel time between Masalli and Astara of about 60% for all types of vehicles, and contribute to \nreducing the number of road traffic accidents by half. \n \n55.  The economic analysis shows that Project 1 is economically viable, with an estimated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 12.8% and an estimated net present value of $7.0 \nmillion at a 12% discount rate. A sensitivity analysis confirms the economic viability of Project 1, \nwith the EIRR higher than 12% when operation and maintenance costs increase by 20%. The \nEIRR figures are marginally lower than 12% when (i) project implementation extends by 1 year, \n(ii) capital costs increase by 10%, (iii) traffic growth decrease by 10%, and (iv) project benefits \ndecrease by 10%. However, these figures are deemed within an acceptable range. The risk \nanalysis shows that Project 1 has 93% probability of having an EIRR higher than 12% and a \npositive net present value. \n \nC.  Financial Management and Sustainability \n56.  Financial analysis will be conducted for projects financed under the MFF, if necessary, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.19 Project 1 is not a \nrevenue-earning project and does not require a financial analysis. A financial management \nassessment of ARS was undertaken based on questionnaires and field interviews to assess its \nability to fulfill ADB's fiduciary requirements for the Program. ARS\u2019s financial management was \nfound  acceptable,  although  further  improvement  is  needed.  ARS  received  World  Bank \nassistance in developing a corporate plan and financial reporting and procedures manual, and \nEBRD  assistance  in  implementing  the  corporate  plan.  With  external  assistance,  ARS  has \nimproved its capacity of managing implementation of aid-funded projects. Under Project 1, \nexternal  independent  auditing  of  contracts,  accounts,  and  financial  statements  will  be \nundertaken to ensure fiduciary oversight. \n \n57.  Analysis was undertaken to assess the Government\u2019s counterpart funding for, and debt \nrepayment from, Project 1. The Government is committed to timely provision of the required \ncounterpart funding during implementation of Project 1. Azerbaijan\u2019s external debt situation \nremains moderate and its debt repayment capacity is strong. At the end of 2006, the total stock \nof public and publicly guaranteed external debt amounted to $1.9 billion (15% of GDP) and the \ndebt service ratio accounted for 1.1% of exports of goods and services. Fitch Ratings upgraded \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  sovereign  rating  to  \u201cBB+\u201d  from  \u201cBB\u201d  for  long-term  foreign  currency  and  local \ncurrency  credit  in  February  2007.  With  Azerbaijan\u2019s  strong  medium-term  macroeconomic \noutlook, the MFF is expected to have a limited impact on the debt situation in the country. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n58.  Environmental assessment will be conduced for all projects financed under the MFF in \naccordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  prepared  by  the \nGovernment and agreed with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) as well \nas  relevant  laws  and  regulations  in  Azerbaijan.  Project  1  is  classified  category  A.  An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) of Project 1 was undertaken, and is being approved by \nthe Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The SEIA was circulated to the Board and \npublicly  disclosed  through  the  ADB  website  on  16  January  2007.  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework for the Program is included in the SEIA. The EIA concludes \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "16    \nthat the overall environmental impacts of Project 1 will be insignificant and can be minimized by \nadequate mitigation measures included in the environmental management plan. \n \n59.  Project 1 is located far from the protected areas\u2014Hirkan National Park and Astara Chay \nImportant Bird Area\u2014and is thus expected to have no impacts on them. It will neither block any \nknown animal migration trails, nor intersect any known protected species of flora or fauna along \nthe alignment. Bridge contractors will avoid substructure (foundation) work during any known \nspawning season for the rivers that the project expressway traverses. No historical, cultural, or \narchaeological sites are within or near the project area. Although some trees will be cut from the \nsecondary growth Moscow Forest, civil works contracts will be mandated to replant trees. If the \nexpressway noise exceeds local standards, linear sound barriers and insulated windows will be \nused to mitigate the noise impacts. Complete fencing on both sides of the expressway between \nMasalli and Astara, coupled with improved signage and controlled access, will substantially \nimprove safety for local residents. The overall risks on the environment under Project 1 are \nconsidered manageable. \n \nE.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n60.  Poverty and social analysis will be conducted for all projects financed under the MFF in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.20 A summary poverty reduction and social strategy for Project 1 is in \nAppendix 11. The project expressway will traverse three rayons (districts)\u2014Masalli, Lenkaran, \nand Astara\u2014with a total population of 790,700. About 70% of the households in the project area \nlived below the poverty line in 2006, compared with the official poverty rate of about 20% for the \ncountry. While the direct benefits of the project expressway for the poor are relatively small, \nProject  1  will  create  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction,  which  will  generate \nsubstantially  indirect  benefits  for  the  poor.  The  overall  (both  direct  and  indirect)  poverty \nreduction impacts of Project 1 include (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other \ndaily  necessities  because  of  lower  transport  costs;  (ii)  jobs  and  income  generated  from \nconstruction and maintenance of the project expressway; and (iii) improved access to markets \nand social services. \n \n61.  The Program will have a positive impact on gender, because the civil works contracts will \ninclude provisions to encourage employment of women during implementation, and women will \nbe encouraged to participate in activities to monitor program impacts. The PIU will develop and \nimplement a gender plan, with the assistance of the supervision consultants. \n \n62.  All projects financed under the MFF will include appropriate measures to mitigate the \npotential risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as drug and human \ntrafficking. These measures include raising public awareness of the risks of HIV/AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted infections, as well as drug and human trafficking. Civil works contracts will \ninclude provisions requiring contractors to take measures to protect construction workers from \nthe risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and giving construction workers \ntime to be tested or receive treatment. \n \nF.  Social Safeguards \n63.  The  impact  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  assessed  for  all  projects \nfinanced  under  the  MFF  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  prepared  by  the \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2001. Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "  17 \nGovernment and agreed with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995)  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  in  Azerbaijan.  Substantial  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts are expected for the projects that will involve construction of new roads. \nThe  resettlement  framework  was  prepared,  which  specifies  compensation  provisions  and \nprocedures on preparation and implementation of resettlement plans for the projects financed \nunder the MFF. The resettlement framework is summarized in Appendix 12 and provided in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n64.  Project 1 is classified category A, because construction of the new expressway between \nMasalli and Astara entails significant land acquisition. The Resettlement Plan for the core \nsubproject\u2014Section A of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway (km 0\u2013km 22.1)\u2014was prepared and is \nin Supplementary Appendix E. The drafts of the resettlement framework and the Resettlement \nPlan for Section A of Project 1 are found satisfactory. The Ministry of Transport endorsed these \ntwo draft resettlement documents and disclosed them to affected persons on 11 June 2007. The \nresettlement plans for all non-core subprojects with land acquisition and resettlement impacts \n(i.e., sections B and C of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway) are being prepared in accordance \nwith  the  resettlement  framework,  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  fully \nimplemented before the awards of concerned civil works contracts. Appraisal of the subsequent \nprojects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  require  reviewing  the  resettlement  framework  and \npreparing resettlement plans for those projects with land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \nImplementation of the resettlement plans will be a condition for commencement of civil works \nunder the relevant projects. \n \n65.  An assessment of impact on indigenous peoples was undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The Program will primarily affect Azeri people, \nthough some scattered members of other ethnic groups\u2014particularly Talysh\u2014may be affected. \nAs  Talysh  people  have  the  same  rights  as  other  Azerbaijan  groups  and  have  been  fully \nintegrated into institutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country, they do not display \nsufficient features to classify them indigenous peoples. The Program is classified category C. \n \nG.  Assumptions and Risks \n66.  The  Program  was  designed  based  on  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i)  continued \npolitical and macroeconomic stabilities in Azerbaijan, (ii) effective implementation of the State \nProgram on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development, (iii) the Government\u2019s continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to implement the road \nmap and the Program, and (v) adequate financing. \n \n67.  Risks to the Program include (i) limited coordination among government agencies during \nimplementation, (ii) rapid deterioration of the road network caused by weak axle-load controls \nand  insufficient  funding  for  maintenance,  (iii)  delays  in  preparation  and  implementation  of \nsubsequent projects, and (iv) cost overruns caused by unexpected increases in prices of fuel \nand raw materials. The Government has taken the necessary measures to minimize these risks. \nThe steering committee will coordinate work of the agencies to ensure that issues are resolved \npromptly and that these agencies extend concerted support for the Program. The Government \nis  committed,  through  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  to  enforce  axle-load  controls  and  further \nincrease funding for road maintenance. ADB, together with its partners, will provide continued \nsupport to ARS to strengthen its capacity for road network management. Adequate consulting \nservices are provided to help prepare subsequent projects, manage implementation, monitor \nperformance, and report to ADB. Price contingency funds are included in the MFF to respond to \nunforeseen cost changes. \n ", "18    \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  ARS  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, and assurances agreed to in the FFA, which will be incorporated in the \nlegal documents: \n \n(i)  Construction Quality. The Ministry of Transport will ensure that the projects and \nsubprojects  financed  under  the  MFF  comply  with  technical  specifications  of  the \ndesign.  The  Ministry  of  Transport,  through  ARS,  will  ensure  that  construction \nsupervision, quality control, and project management are performed according to \ninternationally accepted standards and practices. \n \n(ii)  Road  Maintenance.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  will  cause  ARS  to  develop  in \nconsultation with ADB and approve a road maintenance plan for 2008\u20132015 by 30 \nSeptember  2008,  which  will  (i)  establish  a  system  for  efficient  planning  and \nprioritization of road maintenance works; (ii) provide funding modalities to finance the \nmaintenance of relevant roads acceptable to ADB, (iii) develop or adopt adequate \nroad maintenance standards and prepare relevant road maintenance planning and \noperational manuals; and (iv) provide training to strengthen the capacity of local \nmaintenance units. The Ministry of Transport will ensure that the road maintenance \nplan is implemented. The Ministry of Transport will use its best efforts to enter in \n2009 into a maintenance concession with a private sector entity for at least 20 km of \nthe local roads financed under tranche 1 of the MFF.

The  transport  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  growing  economy, \naccounting for around 6% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005. As Azerbaijan \nis located in the southeastern part of the Caucasus between Iran and the Russian Federation, \nthe  transport  sector  contributes  significantly  to  regional  cooperation,  and  facilitates  the \ndevelopment of international trade and transit traffic. The transport sector is also crucial to the \ndomestic economy as it links the rural population to urban and international markets. \n \n2.  The transport sector comprises railways, roads, civil aviation, maritime transport, and \npipelines. Roads are the dominant mode of passenger transport, carrying 74% of passengers in \npassenger-kilometers (km) (Table A2.1). Civil aviation accounts for 11%, urban transport for \n9%, and railways for 6%. Freight is mainly carried by railways (36% of the total volume in ton-\nkm), followed equally by roads and maritime transport (28%). Although the freight volume \ncarried by railways is larger than by roads, the volume carried by roads increased more rapidly \nthan other modes of transport. While the total volume of freight increased by 218% from 1995 to \n2005, the volume carried by roads increased by 1,330% during the same period. \n \nTable A2.1: Freight and Passenger Transport by Mode \n \nTransport Mode  1990  1995  2000  2003  2004  2005 \n  Freight Transport (million ton-km) \nRailways  37,076  2,409  5,770  7,719  7,536  9,628 \nRoads  3,287  527  3,513  6,241  6,965  7,536 \nMaritime  5,778  4,325  5,192  6,555  6,771  7,521 \nAir  47  57  102  204  315  310 \nPipelines  3,353  1,013  1,371  1,572  1,696  1,539 \n  Total  49,541  8,331  15,948  22,291  23,283  26,534 \n  Passenger Transport (million passenger-km) \nRailways  1,827  791  493  654  789  878 \nRoads  7,480  4,664  9,153  9,861  9,603  10,892 \nMaritime  68  24  6  6  7  7 \nAir  4,869  1,733  798  1,113  1,450  1,588 \nUrban Transporta 1,721  1,401  917  954  1,965  1,382 \n  Total  15,965  8,613  11,367  12,588  13,814  14,747 \nkm = kilometer. \na    Including tram, trolley, and subway. \nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006.

With the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the subsequent \ndisruption  in  interlinked  transport  operations  across  the  region,  transport  volumes  fell \nsignificantly in Azerbaijan. Traffic volumes have recovered over the last 10 years, but they \nremain below those in the 1980s. With the continued economic growth, transport volumes are \nprojected to further revive over the medium term, increasing the transport sector\u2019s importance to \nthe development in the country. \n \n4.  Like other sectors in Azerbaijan, the transport sector is in transition from a centrally \nplanned to a market-based system, and faces a number of challenges. With Asian Development \nBank (ADB) assistance, the Ministry of Transport prepared a transport sector development \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nstrategy in response to the challenges in June 2006.1 The strategy identified five strategic \npriorities for transport sector development for the medium term: (i) development of a regulatory \nframework, (ii) development of transport infrastructure, (iii) development of the transport service \nmarkets, (iv) improvement of transport safety, and (v) facilitation of transit traffic. \n \nB.  Road Infrastructure \n \n5.  The road network comprises 25,013 km of roads, of which 4,498 km are in the Nagorno-\nKarabakh area and 2,078 km are in the Nakhchivan Autonomous area (Table A2.2). The road \nnetwork is dominated by two major highways: the east\u2013west highway linking the country\u2019s \ncapital, Baku, to the Georgian border; and the north\u2013south highway running from the Russian \nborder to the Iranian border through Baku. In terms of ownership, the roads are divided into \nstate and municipal roads. The state roads consist of 1,531 km of M-roads (main roads and \ntheir feeders) and 5,485 km of A-roads (access roads and their feeders), while the total length of \nmunicipal roads is 17,997 km. Only 191 km are four-lane highways. Approximately 51% of the \nroads (including all M-roads) are paved and 49% gravel. \n \nTable A2.2: Summary of the Road Network, 2005 \n(kilometers) \n \nArea  State Road  Municipal  Total  Percent of  \n  M-road  A-road  Road    Total \nAzerbaijan (main)  1,531  3,563  13,343  18,437  74 \nNaknchivan  0  857  1,221  2,078  8 \nNagorno-Karabakh area  0  1,065  3,433  4,498  18 \n  Total  1,531  5,485  17,997  25,013  100 \n%  6  22  72  100   \nSource: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company, Ministry of Transport. \n \n6.  The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union. Because of \ninsufficient funding for road maintenance, about 75% of the road network is in poor to bad \ncondition. Based on the road condition data available, the major highways have an international \nroughness index (IRI) of 6\u201310, and about 70% of A-roads require rehabilitation. Many roads \nhave to be first reconstructed or rehabilitated so that they can be maintainable. The poor road \nconditions resulted in high transport costs and low safety levels. \n \n7.  In recognition of this, the Government has set improvement of road infrastructure as one \nof  the  priorities  in  the  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development \n(SPPRED) for 2003\u221220052 and embarked on a transport development program (2005\u20132014), \nwhich starts with improvement of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. The majority of the \neast\u2013west highway has been or is being improved with external assistance. The Ganja\u2013Qazakh \nsection was improved with World Bank assistance in November 2006. The sections that are \nexpected to be improved by 2008 include (i) the Hajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir section with assistance of \nthe European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and (ii) the Qazakh\u2013Georgian \nborder section and Ganja Bypass with ADB assistance. The World Bank and ADB are jointly \nhelping develop the southern highway, while EBRD and the Czech Export Bank are assisting in \n                                                 \n1  ADB Technical Assistance Consultant Report. 2006.

The Government is also finalizing a program for improving \nsecondary roads. \n \n8.  Most  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance date from the Soviet era. Although the standards are based on sound technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof such standards for a market-based economy is widely recognized; they need updated to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base in the country. \n \nC.  Vehicle Fleet \n \n9.  The motorization rate in Azerbaijan is low by international standards. The vehicle fleet \nnumbered about 612,000 in 2005, including around 480,000 cars, 91,000 trucks, and 27,000 \nbuses (Table A2.3). This was equivalent to 73 vehicles per 1,000 people. About 70% of trucks \nand 50% of buses have been operating for over 10 years, with an inevitable effect on the level \nof service and the costs of operation. The vehicle fleet has recently grown rapidly at an annual \nrate of 10%. This trend is projected to gain further momentum with continued strong economic \ngrowth  in  the  country.  The  rapid  increase  in  vehicle  fleet  will  require  development  or \nimprovement of road infrastructure. Vehicle ownership varies regionally, with a national average \nof 26 vehicles per 100 families compared with nearly 35 vehicles in Baku. \n \nTable A2.3: Vehicle Fleet (\u2018000 units) \n \nVehicle Type  1990  1995  2000  2003  2004  2005 \nCars  260.2  278.3  332.0  400.4  439.0  479.4 \nBuses  14.0  12.8  16.8  18.8  21.0  26.7 \nTrucks  99.5  79.7  78.6  79.0  80.9  90.9 \nOther  25.0  21.4  13.3  13.2  13.1  15.0 \n  Total  398.7  392.2  440.7  511.4  554.0  612.0 \nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006.

Presidential Decree No. 299 issued in March 2000 on the application of the Law of \nRoads  of  December  1999  lays  the  legal,  technical,  economic,  and  institutional  basis  for \nmanagement of the road subsector, including design, construction, operation, and maintenance \nof  roads.  The  decree  also  outlines  the  basic  relations  between  stakeholders  in  the  road \nsubsector. \n \n11.  Prior  to  2003,  Azeravtoyol,  a  state  company,  managed  the  road  subsector.  As \nAzeravtoyol  was  modeled  on  centralized  decision-making  processes,  bureaucracy,  and \nadministration procedures inherited from the former Soviet Union, it could not perform functions \nproperly. As a result, the Government dissolved Azeravtoyol and established the Ministry of \nTransport to assume overall responsibility for policy, regulations, and administration of the \ntransport sector in 2003. The road network (excluding Nakhchivan)3 is under the responsibility of \nthe AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport, which \nwas  reorganized  from  the  Road  Transport  Service  Department  in  March  2007.  ARS  has \nheadquarters in Baku with 90 staff, and 61 rayon (district)-based units with approximately 3,000 \nstaff. An organization chart of ARS headquarters is in Figure A2. \n                                                 \n3  Nakhchivan has its own road agency, Nakhavtoyol. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nFigure A2: Organization Chart of the AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company \n(Headquarters) \n \n \n \n  Chair \n \n \n \nDeputy  \n  Administration Division \nChair \n  -  Human resources \n-  Legal \n \n-  Households \n  -  Financial \n-  Reporting \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRoad Maintenance  Technical Division  Ecology and Safety  Land  Acquisition  Investment Division \n  Division  -  Project cost estimates  Division  Division  -  Investment planning \n  -  Road structure  -  Project examination  -  Project management \n-  Traffic regulations  -  Technical standards  -  Foreign relations \n \n \nSource: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company, Ministry of Transport. \n \n12.  While  the  creation  of  ARS  to  replace  Azeravtoyol  was  a  major  achievement,  the \ninstitutional capacity in the road subsector remains limited. ARS received assistance from the \nWorld Bank for institutional strengthening during 2003\u20132005. The assistance covered 11 areas, \nwith the major components including (i) developing a corporate plan, (ii) reviewing road user \ncharges,  (iii)  establishing  a  pavement  management  system,  (iv)  formulating  a  financial \nmanagement system, (v) developing a multiyear rolling budget and a multiyear road investment \nprogram, and (vi) preparing a traffic safety plan. As the first step toward sound governance in \nthe  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  assistance  produced  a  number  of  recommendations. \nFurther external assistance is needed to strengthen the institutional capacity in the subsector by \nsupporting implementation of these recommendations. \n \n13.  The  Government  has  recently  taken  further  measures  to  enhance  the  institutional \ncapacity in the road subsector. A Motor Law was drafted and is currently being discussed at the \nCabinet of Ministers. A corporate plan was developed, which includes establishing a \u201cclient-\nsupplier\u201d relationship between the Ministry of Transport and ARS. This relationship will be \nformulated through a service agreement supported under the EBRD-assisted project. A Road \nAdvisory Board will be established to enhance subsector governance. \n \nE.  Financing \n \n14.  With the abolishment of the Road Fund in 2001, the road subsector was financed \nprimarily from the Government\u2019s budget, while all revenues from taxes related to roads were \ncredited to the Government\u2019s budgets. The Government decided to restore the Road Fund in \nJanuary 2007, but it is too early to assess its performance. ARS\u2019s budget increased from $15.7 \nmillion in 2003 to $106.8 million in 2006. The 2006 budget comprised $45.2 million for capital \ninvestment (42.3% of the total), $55.5 million for road maintenance (52.0%), $3.9 million for \nadministration  (3.6%),  and  $2.2  million  for  planning  and  design  (2.1%)  (Table  A2.4).  The \n ", "Appendix 2  27\nAzerbaijan Accounting Chamber, the Government's audit office, conducted an audit of ARS in \nJune 2006, and the results were generally satisfactory. \n \n15.  ARS\u2019s financial management capacity is limited because of the scarcity of experienced \nhuman  resources,  inadequate  staff  training,  and  lack  of  a  computer-based  management \ninformation system. The World Bank assisted ARS in developing a computerized accounting \nsystem. Although equipment was purchased and staff training provided, ARS has yet to receive \nthe approval of the Ministry of Transport to implement the computerized accounting system. The \nWorld  Bank  also  prepared  a  manual  on  financial  management  for  ARS.  Further  external \nassistance is needed to strengthen ARS\u2019s capacity for financial management. \n \nTable A2.4: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector, 2001\u20132006 ($ million) \n \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nCapital Investment   2.9  3.2  9.6  1.9  53.1  45.2 \nRoad Maintenance             \n  Routine Maintenance  5.0  4.3  4.0  7.0  18.6  31.1 \n  Periodic Maintenance  0.7  1.3  1.5  7.3  6.5  22.2 \n  Equipment  0.0  0.0  0.3  0.0  0.0  2.2 \nAdministration  0.2  0.2  0.2  0.4    3.9 \nPlanning and Design   0.0  0.0  0.1  0.0  0.0  2.2 \n  Total    8.8  9.0  15.7  16.6  78.2  106.8 \nSource: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company, Ministry of Transport. \n \nF.  Road Maintenance \n \n16.  Azerbaijan inherited a large stock of road infrastructure from the former Soviet Union \nand is facing the challenge of properly maintaining the road network with limited resources. \nHowever, funding for road maintenance has since then been inadequate. As a result, a large \npart of the road network deteriorated rapidly and has become non-maintainable. While ARS \nestimates that maintenance costs for 2006 were about $273 million based on the assumption \nthat  the  entire  road  network  is  maintainable,  ADB  staff  estimates  that  minimum  road \nmaintenance costs for 2006 were $41 million, partly because only about 25% of the road \nnetwork is currently maintainable and partly because the unit rates were estimated lower (Table \nA2.5).  In  recognition  that  the  transport  development  program  cannot  be  sustained  without \nadequate resources to properly maintain them, the Government significantly increased funding \nfor road maintenance from $5.7 million in 2001 to $55.5 million in 2006 (Table A2.4), and further \nto $90 million in 2007. It also plans to launch a road maintenance program in parallel with the \nroad improvement. The program envisages a steady increase in the maintainable network as \nroad improvement takes place and a corresponding increase in maintenance funding to cover \nthe entire network by 2015. \n \n17.  ARS\u2019s 61 rayon-based maintenance units undertake road maintenance works on a force \naccount basis. Each unit is responsible for the main and secondary roads in an individual rayon, \nand operates using its own labor force and equipment. However, the maintenance units are \ninefficient  because  of  lack  of  economic  scale  and  weak  management.  The  World  Bank \nrecommended that the 61 rayon-based maintenance units be restructured into 4\u20135 regional \nmaintenance units, with each responsible for about 5,000 km of the road network. It also \nrecommended that periodic maintenance be undertaken through competitive bidding by private \nsector  contractors,  while  routine  maintenance  will  be  initially  undertaken  by  the  regional \nmaintenance units, and be gradually open to private sector contractors. ADB and EBRD are \nassisting ARS in reorganizing regional maintenance units. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.5: Annual Funding Requirements for Road Maintenance, 2006\u20132015 ($ million)a\n \nYear  Maintainable  ARS Assessment  ADB Staff Assessment \nNetwork \n2006  25%  273  41 \n2007  35%  287  48 \n2008  50%  301  57 \n2009  60%  316  65 \n2010  70%  332  75 \n2011  80%  348  85 \n2012  85%  366  93 \n2013  90%  384  101 \n2014  95%  403  110 \n2015  100%  424  120 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ARS = AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company. \na Adjusted with estimated annual inflation of 5%. \nSources: AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  ARS developed a pavement management system with World Bank assistance. The \nsystem provides the necessary steps of the planning cycle and relies on the highway design \nand  maintenance  4  (HDM4)  model  for  prioritizing  the  network  for  utilization  of  available \nresources.  However,  ARS  needs  support  to  implement  the  system  by  conducting  annual \nsurveys on road network conditions and preparing and implementing annual maintenance plans \nbased on the outcome of the pavement management system. The World Bank will assist ARS \nto develop a database for main roads, while ADB plans to help establish a database for \nsecondary roads. \n \nG.  Road Safety \n \n19.  Road safety has become an acute problem in Azerbaijan. After a gradual decline during \n1994\u20132000, the number of road traffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries has risen rapidly at an \nannual rate of 12.5% since 2001. There were 3,179 road traffic accidents in 2005, resulting in \n1,065 fatalities and 3,668 injuries (Table A2.6). The fatality rate in 2005 was 174 per 10,000 \nvehicles, or roughly 10 times the fatality rate in the Nordic European countries. Pedestrians \naccounted for 60% of casualties in urban areas, while passengers made up 50% of casualties in \nrural areas. The major causes of road traffic accidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety \nfeatures and facilities, weak enforcement of road safety regulations, intoxicated driving, excess \nspeed, and inadequate driver education. \n \n20.  Two  government  agencies  (i.e.,  Road  Traffic  Police  Department  of  the  Ministry  of \nInternal Affairs and ARS of the Ministry of Transport) are responsible for road safety. However, \neach  operates  largely  independently.  Although  the  National  Road  Safety  Commission \ncoordinates activities of the two agencies, it does not have executive or operational powers. \n \n21.  To improve road safety, the Government prepared a 5-year road safety program with \nWorld Bank assistance. The key recommendations included (i) replacing the National Road \nSafety Commission with a road safety board that has defined objectives, executive powers for \ntaking  actions  to  reduce  accidents,  adequate  funding,  and  a  permanent  secretariat;  (ii) \nstrengthening ARS\u2019s capability to identify and rectify accident black spots on the road network; \n(iii) establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (iv) reviewing and \nrevising,  if  necessary,  legislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  and  (v)  raising  public \nawareness for road safety. The ADB-assisted East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project is \nhelping implement the road safety program; develop road accident monitoring, reporting, and \n ", "Appendix 2  29\ninformation  systems;  identify  accident  black  spots  on  the  road  network;  and  provide  staff \ntraining. \n \nTable A2.6: Road Traffic Accidents \n \nYear  Road Accidents  Number of Deaths  Number of Injuries \n1994  2,908  1,130  3,301 \n1995  2,556  1,001  2,823 \n1996  2,200  767  2,441 \n1997  2,001  606  2,292 \n1998  1,998  595  2,309 \n1999  1,996  554  2,316 \n2000  1,987  596  2,199 \n2001  1,985  559  2,228 \n2002  2,196  642  2,486 \n2003  2,311  724  2,691 \n2004  2,388  811  2,766 \n2005  3,179  1,065  3,668 \nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 2006. Transport Statistical Yearbook. Baku. \n \nH.  Vehicle Axle-Load Control \n \n22.  Azerbaijan  has  developed  regulations  to  limit  vehicle  axle  load  to  13  tons,  but \nenforcement is weak primarily because of limited institutional capacity and lack of vehicle weigh \nfacilities along the main roads. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent. Surveys \nconducted showed that about 20% of 4-axle trucks, 5-axle trucks, and buses exceeded the axle-\nload  limit.  Heavy  vehicle  weights  are  one  of  the  primary  causes  of  rapid  pavements \ndeterioration.  The  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  control  is  urgently  needed  to  prevent \npremature deterioration of the road network. \n \n23.  In response, the Government recently decided to enforce axle-load regulations by (i) \nestablishing 12 vehicle weighing stations along main roads, where overloaded vehicles will be \nrequired to redistribute or unload exceeded freight; and (ii) collecting reliable data on vehicle \naxle  loads by  installing  permanent  \u201cweigh-in-motion\u201d  devices at  key  points  along  the  road \nnetwork.  ADB  is  assisting  ARS  in  establishing  and  operating  vehicle  weigh  stations,  and \nimproving monitoring of axle overloading under the East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project, \nand will continue to do so under the proposed multitrache financing facility. \n \nI.  Road Transport Services \n \n24.  The road transport service market is almost fully liberalized in Azerbaijan. The private \nsector plays a key role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 95% of \nfreight  and  passenger  transport.  The  state-owned  road  transport  operators  were  largely \nprivatized and foreign road transport operators are allowed to set up business. Freight charges \nand bus fares for domestic road transport are determined based on market conditions, although \nthe Government is setting up tariffs and prices for urban passenger transport, and crossborder \nand international transit traffic. The Government has recently introduced vehicle licensing to \nenhance axle-load control and improve road safety. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nROAD SUBSECTOR ROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Challenges \n \n1.  Azerbaijan\u2019s road subsector faces four major development challenges: \n \n(i)  Deteriorating infrastructure. The public road network was primarily developed \nunder the former Soviet Union, and cannot meet the need of the rapidly growing \neconomy. Most roads are in poor condition because of insufficient funding for \nroad maintenance, and weak enforcement of vehicle axle-load controls. As a \nresult,  a  large  part  of  the  road  network  is  not  maintainable  and  needs \nreconstruction  or  rehabilitation.  The  poor  road  conditions  resulted  in  high \ntransport costs, long travel time, and low safety levels. The rapid increase in \nvehicle fleet, which is projected to continue over the medium term, would require \ndevelopment of the road network. \n \n(ii)  Poor safety record. Road safety is an acute problem, as the number of road \ntraffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries has increased rapidly since 2001, causing \nsignificant economic and human losses. The current fatality rate is around 10 \ntimes the fatality rate in the Nordic European countries. The major causes of road \naccidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety features, weak enforcement of \nsafety  regulations,  intoxicated  driving,  excess  speed,  and  inadequate  driver \neducation. With the rapid growth of vehicle fleet, there is potential for more road \ntraffic accidents in the future, unless remedial action is taken. \n \n(iii)  Inefficient crossborder and transit facilities. Azerbaijan is a signatory to a \nnumber  of  international  transit  and  transport  agreements  and  conventions. \nHowever, crossborder and transit road transport is inefficient, mainly because of \ninadequate  road  infrastructure  and  crossborder  facilities,  as  well  as \nnonharmonized  procedures  with  neighboring  countries.  Surveys  showed  that \n80% of companies experienced delays of 1\u22123 days in crossing the borders of \nAzerbaijan.1 These barriers severely hinder crossborder and transit traffic. \n \n(iv)  Limited  institutional  capacity.  Despite  some  improvement,  institutional \ncapacity in the road subsector remains limited. This is reflected by (a) lack of a \nlegal and regulatory framework for tolling roads; (b) weak enforcement of some \nregulations; (c) lack of private sector participation in road maintenance; (d) the \nneed  to  improve  financial  management;  and  (e)  limited  experience  in \nmanagement of road projects. Limited institutional capacity is a major constraint \non sustainable development of the road subsector. \n \nB.  Development Strategy \n \n2.  The Government has set improvement of road infrastructure as one of the priorities in \ntwo  state  programs:  (i)  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development \n(SPPRED), and (ii) State Program on Socioeconomic Development of Regions. To implement \nthese programs, the Ministry of Transport has drafted a Transport Policy Paper, followed by a \nTransport  Sector  Development  Strategy  developed  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002.

General \n \n1.  Project  1  comprise  a  core  subproject  covering  section  A  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara \nexpressway (kilometer [km] 0\u2013km 22.1) and three non-core subprojects: (i) section B of the \nMasalli\u2013Astara expressway (km 22.1\u2013km 45.1, including the Lenkaran bridge); (ii) section C of \nthe  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway  (km  45.1\u2013km  58.6);  and  (iii)  improvement  of  local  roads, \ninstallation of vehicle weighing station, and procurement of road maintenance equipment. The \neconomic analysis of Project 1 covers two major project components: construction of the new \nexpressway  between  Masalli  and  Astara  and  rehabilitation  of  local  roads.  The  economic \nanalysis covers 2008\u20132027, comprising 2 years of construction and 18 years of operation. It is \nbased on a comparison of with- and without-project cases, and uses 2006 economic prices. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecasts \n \n2.  Traffic on the new expressway between Masalli and Astara near the Iranian border was \nbased on traffic surveys on the existing road between Alyat and Astara conducted by the \nconsultants under the project preparatory technical assistance, supplemented by (i) surveys and \nanalysis from Passillo Engineering Consultants, (ii) regular traffic counts from  AzerRoadService \nOpen Joint-Stock Company (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport, and (iii) spot traffic checks \nfrom  the  World  Bank  consultants  (for  the  Alyat\u2013Masalli  section).  The  results  of  the  traffic \nsurveys are summarized in Table A10.1. Four major findings are worth mentioning. First, the \ncurrent level of traffic follows a decreasing trend from Alyat to Astara. The average daily traffic \nfell from about 7,000 vehicles near Alyat to about 5,000 vehicles near Masalli and further to \naround 3,800 vehicles near Astara. Second, cars and jeeps account for about three quarters of \nthe traffic, while heavy vehicles make up 20% of the traffic. Third, approximately 60% of the \ntraffic is local, with crossborder and international transit vehicles, either coming from or destined \nfor Iran or Turkey, accounting for about 5% of the total traffic. \n \nTable A10.1: Summary of Average Daily Traffic, 2006 \n \nVehicle  Near Masalli (km 242)  After Lenkaran (km 282) \n  Number  %  Number  % \nCar/Jeep  3,606  72  2,829  75 \nMicrobus  221  4  222  6 \nVan  125  3  85  2 \nBig bus  84  2  129  3 \nTruck 2 axles  393  8  145  5 \nTruck 3 axles   259  5  178  5 \nTruck 4 axles  42  1  13  0 \nTruck 5 axles  212  4  130  3 \nTruck 6 axles  53  1  44  1 \n  Total    4,995  100  3,775  100 \nSources: Asian Development Bank staff and project preparatory technical assistance.  \n \n3.  Traffic demand was projected based on projected growth of gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita and population, as well as the estimated income elasticity of demand in \nAzerbaijan. GDP was projected to grow at 9% annually for 2008\u20132012 and 8.1% for 2013\u20132027. \nThe annual growth rate of population was forecast to remain stable at 1%. The average income \n ", "Appendix 10  47\nelasticity  of  demand  of  1.5  for  passengers  and  1.0  for  freight  was  used  in  the  economic \nanalysis. \n \n4.  Traffic on the new expressway is expected to comprise (i) normal traffic, (ii) generated \ntraffic arising from lower transport cost and reduced travel time, and (iii) diverted traffic from the \nexisting road between Masalli and Astara. The new expressway is projected to attract a low \nvolume  of  generated  traffic  initially,  because  road  users  are  not  expected  to  significantly \nincrease their travel on the expressway. Once the reconstruction of the entire north\u2013south road \ncorridor running from the Russian border to the Iranian border through Baku is completed, \ngenerated traffic is projected to grow rapidly. The expressway is also expected to result in little \ndiverted traffic, because the majority of the current traffic between Masalli and Astara is local. \nAs such, traffic projection uses the diversion rates of 100% for international traffic, 100% for \ntraffic from/to Baku, 90% from through traffic from other origins and destinations, 50% for local \ntraffic between rayon (district) centers, and 20% for local traffic within the same rayon. Traffic \nvolume on the expressway is projected to grow at 8.3% annually, with average daily traffic \nincreasing from 4,040 vehicles in 2008 to 20,358 vehicles in 2027 (Table A10.2). \n \nTable A10.2: Traffic Projection for the Masalli\u2013Astara Expressway, 2008\u20132027 \n(number of vehicles per day) \n \nYear  Normal and Diverted Traffic  Generated Traffic  Total Traffic \n2008  4,040  0  4,040 \n2009  4,408  0  4,408 \n2010  4,811  505  5,316 \n2011  5,249  551  5,800 \n2012  5,728  601  6,329 \n2013  6,192  650  6,842 \n2014  6,694  702  7,396 \n2015  7,236  759  7,995 \n2016  7,822  821  8,643 \n2017  8,456  887  9,343 \n2018  9,141  959  10,100 \n2019  9,881  1,037  10,918 \n2020  10,681  1,121  11,802 \n2021  11,547  1,211  12,758 \n2022  12,482  1,310  13,791 \n2023  13,480  1,416  14,909 \n2024  14,559  1,530  16,116 \n2025  15,724  1,654  17,422 \n2026  16,981  1,788  18,833 \n2027  18,340  1,933  20,358 \nSources: Asian Development Bank staff and project preparatory technical assistance. \n \nC.  Economic Costs \n \n5.  The economic costs of Project 1 comprise (i) capital investment, including civil works, \nenvironmental  mitigation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision; and (ii) road maintenance. Costs related to taxes and duties and \nfinancing charges during implementation were excluded. The project costs were divided into \ntradable  and  non-tradable  components.  The  costs  of  non-tradable  components  such  as \nunskilled labor and domestic materials were converted into the world price numeraire using a \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nconversion factor of 0.92.1 Capital investment costs are estimated at $2.29 million per km. The \nannual average maintenance cost of the existing road between Masalli and Astara under the \nwithout-project scenario is estimated at $27,500 per km, while the annual maintenance cost of \nthe new expressway is estimated at $13,800 per km. The reduction in maintenance costs is \nbecause the new expressway entails lower expense on maintenance than the existing road, \nwhich is in poor condition and requires major surfacing and rehabilitation during the analysis \nperiod.  The  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7 was  used  to  estimate the  economic  price  of \nunskilled labor. Skilled labor is not shadow priced since Azerbaijan has no surplus of skilled \nlabor. \n \nD.  Economic Benefits \n \n6.  The economic benefits of Project 1 are savings on vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime, and reduced traffic accidents because of improved road conditions and the short distance \nof the new expressway after project completion. The new expressway will have an average \ninternational roughness index (IRI) value of 2.5, compared to the IRI value of 11.0 for the \nexisting road between Masalli and Astara in 2006. Savings on vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime were calculated using the highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM4) model. Savings on \nvehicle operating costs embody the value of time saved by vehicle drivers and crews, but not by \npassengers or freight. Travel time savings for passengers were calculated at $1.00 per hour\u2014\nthe average nominal wage\u2014for work-related trips. For nonbusiness trips, one third of the value \nof the work time saved is used as proxy for willingness to pay. The time saved for freight is \nestimated at $0.2 per ton per hour.2   \n \n7.  Rehabilitation  of  local  roads  in  the  project  area  also  generates  economic  benefits \nbecause it improves the access to the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway for local communities. The \nselected local roads are in poor condition, and the improvement of these roads will reduce \ntransport  costs  and  travel  time  for  local  residents.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  such \nbenefits.  \n \n8.  The economic benefits are summarized in Table A10.3. It shows that Project 1 will bring \nsavings on vehicle operating costs per km of 11% for cars, 14% for heavy trucks, and near 20% \nfor articulated trucks. The benefits from savings on vehicle operating costs, which initially accrue \nto  vehicle  owners  and  operators,  will  be  gradually  shared  with  passengers  and  freight \ncustomers through reduced bus fares and freight charges. Project 1 will also result in savings on \ntravel time between Masalli and Astara of about 60% for all types of vehicles. The benefits from \nreduced  traffic  accidents  are  not  easy  to  quantify,  so  it  is  assumed  that  Project  1  will \nconservatively  reduce  the  number  of  road  traffic  accidents  by  half,  based  on  similar \nassumptions used in economic analysis from other road projects in Azerbaijan. The benefits \nfrom reduced traffic accidents were conservatively estimated at $25,000 for a fatality and $1,500 \nfor an injury. \n \n                                                 \n1  The conversion factor of 0.92 was also used by the World Bank for its Highway II project, which includes \nconstructing the new Alyat\u2013Masalli expressway on the same southern corridor. \n2  This figure has been widely used in the economic analysis of road projects in Central Asia.  \n ", "Appendix 10  49\nTable A10.3: Economic Benefits by Vehicle Type \n \nVehicle Type  Without Project  With Project  Savings  Savings (%) \nA.

Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n9.  An economic evaluation was undertaken for Project 1, and the results are summarized in \nTable A10.4 and detailed in Table A10.5. They show that Project 1 is economically viable, with \nan estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 12.8% and an estimated net present \nvalue  of  $7.0  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  Section  B  has  a  lower  EIRR  of  8%  and  a \ncorresponding negative net present value, mainly due to the high construction cost of a new \nLenkaran  bridge.  However,  section  B  is  an  integral  part  of  the  entire  Masalli\u2013Astara \nexpressway, so it is justifiable to include this section in Project 1. \n \nTable A10.4: Summary Results of Economic Analysis \n \nRoad Section  Length  Economic Internal  Net Present Value  \n(km)  Rate of Return (%) ($ million) \nSection A (km 0\u2013km 22.1)  22.1  17  15.9 \nSection B (km 22.1\u2013km 45.1)  23.0  8  (17.1) \nSection C (km 45.1\u2013km 58.6)  13.5  17  11.0 \nTotal Project 1 Expressway  58.6  12.8  7.0 \n( ) = negative number, km = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \nTable A10.5: Detailed Economic Analysis ($ million) \n \n  Costs  Benefits  Net  \nYear  Without   With Project  VOC  Time  Accident  Total   Benefits \n  Project  Capital  O&M  Net  Savings  Savings  Reduction     \n2008  0.00  39.17  0.00  39.17  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  (39.17) \n2009  0.00  91.40  0.00  91.40  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  (91.40) \n2010  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 8.40  2.45  0.28  11.13  12.05 \n2011  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 9.19  2.67  0.31  12.17  13.09 \n2012  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 10.06  2.91  0.33  13.30  14.22 \n2013  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 10.88  3.15  0.36  14.38  15.30 \n2014  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 11.76  3.40  0.39  15.55  16.47 \n2015  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 12.71  3.68  0.42  16.81  17.72 \n2016  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 13.74  3.97  0.46  18.17  19.09 \n2017  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 14.85  4.30  0.49  19.64  20.56 \n2018  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 16.05  4.64  0.53  21.23  22.15 \n2019  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 17.35  5.02  0.58  22.95  23.87 \n2020  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 18.76  5.43  0.62  24.81  25.73 \n2021  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 20.28  5.87  0.67  26.82  27.74 \n2022  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 21.92  6.34  0.73  28.99  29.91 \n2023  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 23.70  6.85  0.79  31.34  32.26 \n2024  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 25.62  7.41  0.85  33.88  34.79 \n2025  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 27.69  8.01  0.92  36.62  37.54 \n2026  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 29.93  8.66  0.99  39.59  40.50 \n2027  1.71  0.00  0.79  (0.92) 32.36  9.36  1.07  42.79  43.71 \n        Net present value (at 12% discount rate, $ million)  7.0 \n        Economic Internal Rate of Return (%)  12.8 \n( ) = negative number, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Azerbaijan: \nRoads are one of the major transport modes in Azerbaijan, carrying 74% of passengers in passenger-kilometers and \n28% of freight in ton-kilometers in 2005. However, about 70% of the road network is in poor condition, inhibiting \nsustained economic growth and social development. The State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic \nDevelopment developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance and the State Program on Socioeconomic \nDevelopment of the Regions identified improvement of road network infrastructure as a high priority for economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. The Road Network Development Program (the Program) will construct, upgrade, and \nrehabilitate about 9,500 kilometers (km) of 124 priority roads during 2006\u20132015, which will result in (i) people\u2019s \nincreased mobility and accessibility to markets, jobs, and social services; (ii) greater opportunities for private sector \nparticipation; and (iii) improved governance in the road subsector. The major poverty reduction impacts of the Program \ninclude (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other daily necessities because of lower transport costs; (ii) \njobs and income generated for the poor from road reconstruction, operation, and maintenance, as well as roadside \ncommercial activities; and (iii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDespite recent oil-based economic growth, poverty in Azerbaijan remains high\u2014the official poverty rate was about \n20% for the country in 2006. Poverty is severer in rural areas (45% in 2003), compared to urban areas (44%). Poverty \nis higher in the rayons (districts) of Nakhichevan (59%) and Mughan-Salyan (52%). Project 1 of the Program covers \nthree rayons\u2014Masalli, Lenkaran, and Astara in southern Azerbaijan\u2014with a total population of 790,700. Rural \nresidents account for the majority of the population and about 70% of the households live below the poverty line in the \nproject area in 2006. The average monthly per capita income in the project area is estimated at AZN40.4, lower than \nthe national poverty line of AZN42. Rural villages located at the foot of the Talysh mountains and along the existing \nroad in Astara on the border with Iran appear to be the poorest since they have too little unfertile land and insufficient \nmeans of livelihood. Overall, the majority of the population in the project area is prone to flooding and increase in the \nCaspian Sea level. \n \nThe main causes of poverty in the project area are (i) economic degradation in southern Azerbaijan as a result of \ndecline in demand for the region\u2019s exports of citrus and other fruits, and the collapse of local processing industries; (ii) \nlimited access to the country\u2019s capital, Baku and international markets because of remoteness; (iii) high rural out-\nmigration; (iv) natural calamities; (v) limited social services; and (vi) deterioration of health among working-age \npopulations (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria). However, poor road network infrastructure imposes constraints on access to \njob opportunities, markets, and basic social services (education and health), and thus affect the poor. Most villages \nare located 0.5 km or more from the main roads. The majority of the rural population, particularly the poor, has to walk \nto the main roads to access social services and buy necessities. The cost of reaching markets outside the village is \nhigh, due to poor road conditions and expensive transport services. Improving road infrastructure is one of the \npriorities in the State Program on Poverty Reduction  and Economic Development and the State Program on \nSocioeconomic Development of the Regions. \n \nThe Program will contribute to poverty reduction in Azerbaijan by creating an enabling environment for poverty \nreduction; and increasing access to markets, job opportunities, and basic social services for the whole population, \nincluding the poor. Project 1 is expected to create about 3,000 person-years of jobs for road construction, of which \nabout 2,000 person-years will be unskilled jobs; half of the unskilled work will be for the poor.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  53\n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring the preparation of the Program and Project 1, extensive consultations were held with various stakeholders\u2014\nincluding representatives of central and local governments, civil society, local communities, the private sector, road \nusers, and external aid agencies. The public consultations were held through meetings, interviews, surveys, group \ndiscussions, and written communications, with the participation of about 3,000 people. The consultations covered \nmajor issues such as selection of roads, road alignment, transport services, investment benefits, and social and \nenvironmental impacts of the Program. The results showed a high degree of public support for the Program. The \ndesigns of the Program and Project 1 incorporated the views of stakeholders. Special attention was given to the needs \nand constraints faced by women, internally displaced people, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. The summary \nenvironmental impact assessment of Project 1 was disclosed publicly through the ADB website. The resettlement plan \nfor subproject A of Project 1 was disclosed to the affect persons. The resettlement plans for subprojects B and C of \nProject 1 are being prepared in consultation with affected persons, and will be disclosed to them upon completion. \nStakeholder participation and consultation will continue during implementation. The AzerRoadService Open Joint-\nStock Company (ARS) under the Ministry of Transport will ensure that resettlement monitoring reports are made \navailable to affected persons. For subsequent projects, ARS will hold stakeholder consultations during the preparation \nof resettlement plans and environmental assessments, and disclose them to the public through the ADB website. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe participation strategy aims to ensure the active participation of stakeholders during the design and implementation \nof the Program to achieve its impact fully. This strategy will include the need for raising stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the \nimpacts, outcome, outputs, and activities of the Program, using multiple methods such as public meetings, interviews, \nsurveys, newspapers, and local announcements. The strategy will include a consultative phase during detailed design, \nthrough which the program support consultant will assist in the participatory process, together with local stakeholders, \nto develop appropriate locations and designs for pedestrian and livestock crossing points, lighting, speed control, and \nroadside market areas. This strategy will be reviewed with representatives of target groups and modified, if needed, \naccording to relevant inputs during implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nDuring preparation of Project 1, a gender analysis was conducted, based on the gender-disaggregated data collected \nvia household surveys, review of secondary data, and qualitative data gathered though community consultations in \ncollaboration with the Azerbaijan Women and Development Center, one of the leading nongovernment organization in \nAzerbaijan. The analysis showed that women (single, young, elderly, and those with many children) need special \nassistance to fully benefit from the Program. \n \nThe Program is expected to create job opportunities for women during implementation (e.g., construction, catering, \ncleaning, and food services) and in roadside businesses (e.g., cafes and shops) after completion. Contracts for civil \nworks and consulting services will include provisions to encourage employment of skilled and unskilled women \nlaborers. During detailed design, the consultant will coordinate closely with representatives of vulnerable women\u2019s \nassociations in the project area to identify effective modalities to ensure (i) their involvement in, and direct benefit \nfrom, increased commercial activities in roadside markets; and (ii) appropriate mitigation measures included in the \nproject design to minimize negative impacts on them. During implementation, civil works contractors will be required to \ntake measures to mitigate the potential risks of HIV/AIDS. These measures will include raising public awareness on \nthe risk of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS) through leaflet distribution to road construction workers \nand local communities, and giving workers time to be tested or receive treatment. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Background \n \n1.  The Government of Azerbaijan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nhelp finance the Road Network Development Program (the Program) through a multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  in  the  amount  up  to  the  equivalent  of  $500  million.  The  MFF  will \ncomprise multiple loans. The projects financed under the MFF are expected to cause land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. Project 1 will construct about 59 kilometers (km) of \na new four-lane expressway between Masalli and Astara on the border with Iran, which is the \nsouthern segment of the new expressway between Alyat and Astara the southern transport \ncorridor. Project 1 comprises subproject A\u2014a core subproject covering section km 0\u2013km 22.1 of \nthe Masalli\u2013Astara expressway and two non-core subprojects: (i) subproject B (section km \n22.1\u2013km 45.1 of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway), and (ii) subproject C (section km 45.1\u2013km \n58.6 of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway). Under subproject A, the financing will also be provided \nfor  rehabilitation  of  local  roads,  procurement  of  road  maintenance  equipment  and  vehicle \nweighing station to be used on the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway, project support, and capacity \nbuilding. All subprojects on the new Masalli\u2013Astara expressway will entail LAR. No impacts on \nindigenous peoples are envisaged for the entire Program. \n \nB.  General Procedures \n \n2.  LAR  will  follow  Azerbaijan\u2019s  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006). \nAppraisal  of  the  MFF  and  each  project  involving  LAR  will  require  preparing  the  following \ndocuments. \n \n(i)  A resettlement framework for the MFF to be reviewed, updated (if necessary), \nand submitted to ADB for approval annually and before the preparation of each \ntranche. \n \n(ii)  An initial poverty and social assessment, indicating whether LAR impacts are \nexpected and, if so, their type and magnitude for each project. \n \n(iii)  A resettlement plan for the project with LAR impact, based on detailed design \nand inclusive of compensation budgets and schedules.1 \n \n3.  Appraisal of the MFF and each project will meet the following LAR-related requirements. \n \n(i)  Appraisal of MFF and Project 1: conditional to preparation of a resettlement \nframework  for  the  MFF  and  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  core  subproject \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n(ii)  Appraisal of subsequent projects: conditional to (a) review and updating of the \nresettlement framework, and (b) preparation of the resettlement plans for all \nprojects with LAR impact. \n \n(iii)  Contract awards for each project: conditional to preparation of the concerned \nresettlement plan, based on the final design and accepted by ADB. \n                                                 \n1  According  to  ADB.  2006.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2:  Involuntary  Resettlement.  Manila,  the  type  of \nresettlement plan rests on the significance of the involuntary resettlement impacts. If 200 or more people will be \nresettled from housing, or 10% or more of their income will be lost, a project is classified category A and a full \nresettlement plan will be prepared. If less than 200 people will be resettled or less than 10% of their income will be \nlost, a project is classified category B and a short resettlement plan will be prepared. \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \n \n(iv)  Start of civil works for each project: conditional to the implementation of a full \nresettlement plan. \n \n4.  In accordance with the above requirements, the Ministry of Transport, the Executing \nAgency and the AzerRoadService Open Joint-Stock Company (ARS) under the Ministry of \nTransport, the Implementing Agency, prepared the resettlement framework and the resettlement \nplan for section A of Project 1\u2014the core subproject under Project 1. The resettlement plans for \nall non-core subprojects under Project 1 (i.e., sections B and C of the Project 1 expressway) are \nbeing prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework, and will be submitted to ADB for \napproval and fully implemented before the awards of concerned civil works contracts. \n \nC.  Resettlement Framework \n \n5.  The  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and \nregulations  in  Azerbaijan  and  ADB\u2019s  Resettlement Policy.  The  resettlement  framework \n \nprescribes  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii) \ncompensation will ensure the maintenance of the pre-project living standards of affected people; \n(iii) affected persons will be fully informed of and consulted on compensation options; (iv) socio-\ncultural institutions of affected persons will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply \nequally  to  both  genders;  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  and \nrehabilitation; (vii) particular attention will be paid to women-headed households and vulnerable \ngroups; (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the project and LAR \nbudgets will be included in project costs; and (ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to \nground leveling and demolition. The resettlement framework also covers all relevant issues for \nLAR  tasks  to  be  carried  out  effectively  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy,  and  sets  the \neligibility/entitlement provisions in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Compensation Entitlement Matrix \n \nAsseta  Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nPermanent  All land losses  Farmer/Titleholder  \u2022 Land for land compensation with plots of equal value and \nimpact on  independently  productivity to the plots lost, or \narable land  from impact  \u2022 Cash compensation for affected land at replacement cost based \nseverity  on market valueb free of taxes, registration, and transfer. \n\u2022 Residual portions of plots affected by the required right-of-way \nthat are reduced to less than 400 m2 or rendered unusable by \nalterations in access, irrigation, or workability will be included in \nthe affected land and compensated as above indicated above. \nLeaseholder  \u2022 Renewal of lease in other plots of equal value/productivity of \nplots lost, or  \n\u2022 Cash compensation for affected land at full replacement cost \nfree of taxes, registration, and transfer costs. \nSharecroppers  \u2022 Cash compensation equal to the market value of the lost \nharvest share once (temporary impact) or twice (permanent \nimpact).  \nAgricultural   \u2022 Cash indemnity corresponding to their salary (including portions \nworkers losing their  in kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural year. \ncontract \nSquatters  \u2022 Actual crop loss compensation and resettlement assistance will \nbe provided (see below). \nAdditional  Farmer/Titleholder  \u2022 1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of 1 net \nprovisions for  Leaseholder  harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of winter and \nsevere impacts  summer crop and (additional to standard crop compensation). \n(more than  Sharecroppers  \u2022 1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of share of \n10% of land  harvest (additional to standard crop compensation). \nloss)  Squatters  \u2022 1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of net harvest \n ", "Appendix 12  57\nAsseta  Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nof the affected land for 1 year (additional to standard crop \ncompensation). \nResidential/    Titleholder  \u2022 Land for land compensation through provision of a plot \ncommercial  comparable in value/location to plot, or  \nland  \u2022 Cash compensation for affected land at full replacement cost \nfree of taxes, registration, and transfer costs. \nRenter/Leaseholder  \u2022 1\u20133 months allowance \nSquatters  \u2022 Provision of a free or leased plot in a government resettlement \narea or a self-relocation allowance. \nHouses and    All relevant affected  \u2022 Cash compensation at replacement rates for affected structure \nStructures  persons  and other fixed assets free of salvageable materials, \ndepreciation and transaction costs.

Institutional Responsibilities. ARS has overall responsibility for the Program including \nthe preparation, implementation, and financing of all LAR tasks and interagency coordination. \nARS will exercise its functions through the project implementation unit (PIU), which will be \nresponsible for handling day-to-day project implementation activities. Within ARS, LAR tasks will \nbe  managed  by  the  Land  Acquisition  Division  (LAD),  which  will  organize  and  monitor \npreparation,  approval,  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  (including  surveys,  asset \nvaluation,  and  community  consultation);  and  LAR-related  interagency  coordination.  In  the \nimplementation of these tasks, LAD will be supported by: \n \n(i)  a resettlement team under the supervision consultants, which will assist in LAR \nplanning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and training of staff in ARS \nand local governments in the requirements of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy; \n \n(ii)  a  local  consulting  team  engaged  to  prepare  resettlement  plans,  undertake \nsurveys, collect baseline information, or consult with affected persons; and \n \n(iii)  an independent agency, engaged to conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation, \nand third party validation of implementation of the resettlement plans. \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \n \n7.  Local governments at rayon levels have jurisdiction for land administration, valuation, \nand acquisition, while a number of other local officials (i.e., local representatives of the State \nLand  Committee  and  Institute  of  Cartography)  will  carry  out  specific  roles  such  as  title \nidentification and verification. Functions pertaining to compensation of non-land assets (i.e. \nbuildings  and  crops)  or  income  rehabilitation  also  fall  on  local  governments  and,  more \nspecifically, on relevant rayon offices. \n \n8.  A central LAR commission will be established, which will be chaired by the Ministry of \nTransport and will comprise representatives of the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Economic Development, State Land and Cartography Committee, and the State \nService for Land Registration. The function of this commission is to ensure effective interagency \ncoordination at central government level, carry out a final review of the resettlement framework \nand resettlement plans, and provide official approval of these documents. To provide effective \ninteragency coordination and officially endorse the impacts and compensation rates surveys, \neach  affected  rayon  government  will  also  establish  a  rayon  LAR  commission,  comprising \nrepresentatives of the following local government agencies: Department of Roads, Department \nof Finance, Land and Cartography Commission, local division of the Ministry of Ecology and \nNatural  Resources,  Real  Estate  Registration  Service,  local  executives,  and  other  relevant \norganizations. \n \n9.  Disclosure  and  Public  Consultation.  The  preparation  and  implementation  of \nresettlement plans will involve extensive consultation with affected persons. As an appraisal \ncondition,  the  resettlement  framework  and  relevant  resettlement  plans  in  English  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website, while the resettlement framework and resettlement plans in the \nAzeri language will be disclosed to affected persons. \n \n10.  Grievance Procedures. Affected persons will first lodge a complaint with the PIU. If \nsettlement is not reached within 15 days, the complaint would then be lodged with the rayon \nLAR commission. If the grievance is still not settled within 2 weeks, the affected persons may \nseek redress directly with ARS headquarters. If no solution is found, they may then lodge their \ncomplaints with the appropriate court of law. \n \n11.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PIU will monitor implementation of the resettlement \nplans and ARS will report to ADB on a quarter basis. ARS will engage an independent agency \nfor  external  monitoring.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ARS  and  ADB \nsemiannually. At the end of project implementation, the independent monitoring agency will \ncarry out a general evaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n12.  Financing  and  Schedule.  The  resettlement  framework  prescribes  that  each \nresettlement plan will detail LAR budgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks to the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \nD.  Resettlement Plan for Section A of Project 1 \n \n13.  The core subproject of Project 1 is section A of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway from east \nof Khil village in Masalli rayon approximately to the vicinity of Girdani Canal (km 0\u2013km 22.1, 22 \nkm). The resettlement plan for section A of Project 1, which was prepared based on the \nresettlement  framework  and  detailed  design,  outlines  the  impacts,  compensation  policy, \ncompensation and rehabilitation provisions, cost estimates, and implementation schedule. The \ncore subproject will affect 672 households (2,626 persons). A total of 787 lots with a total area \n ", "Appendix 12  59\nof 5.5 square meters (km2) will be affected, and the land taken from these lots for the right-of- \nway (ROW) is 1.55 km2. The lots to be affected comprise 604 private lots (including a lot owned \nby the municipality but leased to the private sector) and 187 public lots. The total area of \naffected private land is 4.2 km2 and the area taken for the ROW is 0.8 km2. Most of the land is \nunfenced grazing land freely used by owners of animals with few structures and little active \ncultivation. Public lands are the land belonging to the central or municipal governments, and \nused for public works such as roads, canals, irrigation channels, and open grazing lands. The \ntotal area of affected public land is 0.6 km2, all of which will be taken for the ROW. The majority \nof the public land is municipal and non-arable.
