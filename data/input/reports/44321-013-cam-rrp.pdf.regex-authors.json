I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, (ii) a proposed project loan, (iii) proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Strategic  Climate  Fund,1 (iv)  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund, and (v) proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program,2 \nall  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Climate-Resilient  Rice  Commercialization  Sector \nDevelopment Program (program).3  \n \n2.  The program supports the implementation of the Policy on the Promotion of Paddy \nProduction and Rice Export (the Rice Policy) of the Government of Cambodia.4 It will help \ntransform the predominantly subsistence rice subsector into a commercially oriented subsector \nby improving household and national food security and expanding rice export. Mechanisms to \nachieve this objective will include: (i) removing legal and regulatory constraints inhibiting rice \ncommercialization, (ii) improving productivity of paddy crops and consistency in quality of milled \nrice, (iii) enhancing rice value chain support services, and (iv) addressing risks of climate \nchange through mitigation and adaptation.5 The program is consistent with (i) ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific;6 (ii) ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Cambodia, 2011\u20132013;7 and (iii) the agriculture sector assessment, strategy and \nroadmap.8 The program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Cambodia, \n2011\u20132013.9 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Agriculture remains the dominant sector in the Cambodian economy, contributing \n32% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 60% of the workforce, while 80% of the \npopulation depends on the sector for their livelihood.10 The agriculture sector has been one of \nthe main engines of economic growth, achieving steady growth during 2002\u20132012.11 Within \nagriculture, rice accounts for over 90% of the cropped area, the production from which is mostly \nconsumed domestically. The rice subsector accounts for about 50% of the agriculture sector \noutput. The government considers that there is an opportunity within the rice subsector for \nsocioeconomic  development,  and  articulated  its  intentions  in  the  Rice  Policy  to  transform \nCambodia into a \u201crice basket\u201d and a major rice exporting country. In this regard, the government \nhas set three important objectives for 2015: (i) the paddy surplus will exceed 4 million tons, (ii) \n                                                \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF).   \n2   Established by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as trustee. \n3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4   Government of Cambodia. 2010. Policy on Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export. Phnom Penh. The \nRice Policy elaborated short and medium term measures stated in the 2010-2013 Strategy on Water and \nAgriculture (SAW), which aims to achieve enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainable economic growth in \nrural areas through agriculture and water sector programs.  \n5   The design was based on the feasibility study in 2012 financed by ADB. ADB. 2011. Concept Paper \u2013 Cambodia: \nClimate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Program. Manila. \n6   ADB. 2009.

Country Operations \nBusiness Plan for Cambodia, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n8   ADB. 2011. Agriculture Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Roadmap. Manila (updated in 2013). \n9   A sector modality is proposed for the program to support measures stated in the SAW and Rice Policy. Line \nministries have the institutional capacity to implement these measures, following significant experience in a large \nnumber of previous sector development projects financed by ADB and other development partners.  \n10   Agriculture sector includes crop production, forestry, fisheries and animal husbandry. \n11  Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \nmilled  rice  exports  will  be  at  least  1  million  tons,  and  (iii)  Cambodia  is  to  be  recognized \ninternationally as a rice exporting country. \n \n4.  Cambodia reported a paddy surplus estimated at 3.3 million tons in 2010. Despite the \nsurplus, nearly one-quarter of the provinces face food deficit. Eleven percent of all households \nare considered food insecure, with many facing a deficit for 1\u20132 months each year. This figure \nrises  during  the  dry  season  to  an  estimated  18%.  Furthermore,  90%  of  all  food-insecure \nhouseholds  are  found  in  rural  areas.12 Price  fluctuations  across  provinces  are  frequently \nobserved  due  largely  to  (i)  supply  and  demand  imbalances;  and  (ii)  the  movement  of \nunprocessed paddy to Thailand and Viet Nam after each harvest because of the lack of in-\ncountry  storage  and  processing  capacity,  limited  marketing  channels,  and  distribution \ninfrastructure. The quality of Cambodian rice for export is variable, and this can be attributed to \ninappropriate production technologies, lack of post-harvest infrastructure, and varied processing \ntechnologies used by a large number of small-scale producers and processors.  \n \n5.  Given the dominant position of the rice subsector in the economy, transforming it \nfrom a subsistence into a commercially oriented subsector is a strategic option for Cambodia as \nthis provides the best opportunity to improve national food security and expand rice exports, \nresulting in reduced poverty. These twin objectives of food security and export expansion will be \nmutually  reinforced  by  paddy  surplus  marketed  increasingly  within  the  country  and  in \ninternational markets.13 However, to achieve this outcome several critical binding constraints \nmust be addressed. \n \n6.  Lack of an enabling legal and regulatory foundation for rice commercialization. \nFirst, the seed industry is seriously underdeveloped because of the absence of legislation that \ncan protect the interests of and provide incentive for seed developers to produce quality seeds \nfrom new genetic material available elsewhere. Second, land and water productivity has been \nlow, partly aggravated by the absence of a legal framework for land use planning and zoning \nand the lack of soil productivity mapping and land leveling. Third, an inadequate legal system \nand  structure  governing  agriculture  associations  and  contract  farming  has  inhibited  the \nopportunity for farmers to engage in cooperative action to achieve production efficiencies and \nimprove  their  bargaining  power.  These  inadequacies  have  also  hampered  efforts  to  link \nproduction to the quality required by domestic and international markets. Fourth, the lack of a \nquality grading system and regulations on phytosanitary measures, pesticides, and fertilizers \nreduces  the  credibility  of  Cambodian  rice  in  international  markets  because  buyers  lack \nconfidence in receiving the quality ordered compared with alternative supply from other rice \nexporting countries. \n \n7.  Suboptimal use of land and water resources for paddy production. Use of land and \nwater for rice  production  is  influenced  by  local  natural features  and  precipitation  patterns. \nAnnual inundation and subsequent recession of flood waters occur over a large area of flat land \nsurrounding the Tonle Sap Basin and the Mekong River flood plains. Increased incidence of \nflooding and the availability of short maturation rice varieties have given rise to four complex rice \ncropping systems that are continuously shifting in location.14 In response to the need to supply a \ngrowing domestic market and higher rice prices, farmers have extended the cultivated rice \nareas, sometimes into environmentally sensitive areas such as the inundated forest areas.  \n                                                \n12 World Food Program. 2008. Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis\u2014Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n13 The largest market for Cambodian rice is Europe, where 90% of Cambodia\u2019s export went in 2012. Cambodia\u2019s rice \nmarket share in Europe is estimated at about 10%, which is a solid foundation for Cambodia to advance further. \n14  The four rice cropping systems are upland fields, rain-fed lowland fields, deep water paddy fields, and dry season \npaddy fields. \n ", "3 \n8.  Inadequate capacities of post-harvest infrastructure to handle increasing volumes \nof  paddy.  Surplus  paddy  has  mainly  been  exported  wet  to  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  for \nsubsequent drying and processing. Much of this trade has resulted from the lack of post-harvest \ninfrastructure in Cambodia.15 Quality deterioration of moist paddy occurs after harvest if it is not \ndried to 14% moisture content. While volumes of paddy supplied to markets have increased \ndramatically at peak delivery times, the infrastructure to handle, dry, store, and transport the \nvolumes is not sufficiently developed. As a result, the surplus at peak times is cleared, often at \ndiscounted prices, across the border for processing to prevent quality deterioration and, hence, \nin-country value retention is limited.   \n \n9.  Paddy production increasingly vulnerable to the changing climate. Cambodia ranks \n8th among the top 15 countries with highest risk of impact from climate change.16 Climate \nchange has increased the number of extreme climate events such as floods and droughts in \nCambodia. These events have driven farmers to consider alternate cropping systems, and, \nwhere water is available, dry season irrigated rice production is adopted as an alternative. \nNevertheless, some of these changes are detrimental to the sustainable use of land resources. \nGreater focus on the early wet season crop allows farmers to avoid the most severe flooding \nperiod as crops can be harvested before its onset. Recession and late wet season crops \nrespond well to increased fertilizer applications. However, such inappropriate practices will have \na detrimental effect on the structure of certain soil types.  \n \n10.  The program design was informed by lessons learned and recommendations from ADB's \ncountry and sector assistance and program evaluations.17 Cross-sectoral linkages will also be \nmaximized  with  urban  development,  energy,  finance,  and  public  sector  projects  in  ADB's \nongoing and planned initiatives. The geographic focus of interventions will (i) enable integration \nwith development initiatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Economic Corridor, (ii) \nleverage the proximity to population centers and export nodes,18 and (iii) facilitate the targeting \nand strengthening of value chains. Programmatic synergies and coordination with initiatives of \ndevelopment partners are integrated in the design and result framework and validated based on \nsector-wide  consultations  anchored  through  the  joint  government-donor  Technical  Working \nGroup  on  Water  and  Agriculture  and  Technical  Working  Group  on  Land  Management.19 \nLessons learned from these consultations and recent project experience include: (i) the need to \ntackle  constraints  in  agricultural  value  chains,  including  farm  productivity  through  strategic \ninterventions and high priority measures; (ii) enhancing use of sector development program \nmodality to optimize sector outcomes; (iii) adopting a medium-term approach informed by a \ngreater understanding of the complexity of reforms and the capacity of institutions to implement \nreforms; and (iv) ensuring continuity in capacity building support.20 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The program comprises a policy-based loan and a project loan. The impact of the \nprogram will be increased net incomes of stakeholders along the rice value chain. The outcome \nwill be enhanced production of quality rice in Cambodia while preserving the natural resource \nbase.  \n                                                \n15  Wet paddy is defined as grains containing 25%\u201330% moisture. \n16  Alliance Development Works. 2012.

Outputs \n12.  The program has six outputs: output 1 relates to the policy-based loan and outputs 2\u20136 \nrelate to the Climate-Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Project (project). \nThe  provinces  of  Battambang,  Kampong  Thom,  and  Prey  Veng  were  selected  for  project \ninvestment as these are the largest rice producers in Cambodia. In an effort to increase paddy \nfor  export,  these  provinces  have  prioritized  (i)  improving  efficiency  of  land  and  water,  (ii) \nincreasing postharvest handling capacities, and (iii) enhancing resilience of the rice ecosystems. \nAll three provinces are located along the GMS Southern Economic Corridor along which rice \ncan be conveniently transported to Thailand, Viet Nam, and all provinces in Cambodia. By \nfocusing on these provinces, there are good opportunities to enhance national food security by \nimproving availability of milled rice for both export and potentially addressing domestic demand \nand supply imbalances. The project will support development priorities of the three provinces to \ncapitalize on legal and regulatory reforms. The project will be scaled up in 2016 and hence will \nhave significant implication for nationwide replication and consolidating impacts of the Rice \nPolicy. \n \n13.  Output 1: A conducive legal and regulatory environment established to facilitate \nclimate-resilient  rice  commercialization.  This  output  will  focus  on  legal  and  regulatory \nreforms that (i) promote local seed production and distribution, (ii) strengthen agricultural land \nmanagement, (iii) strengthen farmers\u2019 organizations and promote contract farming, and (iv) \nfacilitate domestic trading and export of milled rice. The reform initiatives are in the development \npolicy letter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n14.  Output  2:  Agricultural  land  use  zoning  improved.  This  output  comprises  (i) \nestablishing land use zones; (ii) updating rice ecosystems and soil classification maps for \nidentification of higher yielding rice growing areas; (iii) incorporating agro-ecosystem analyses \ninto commune land use plans; and (iv) capacity building of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand Fisheries (MAFF) and Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction \n(MLMUPC) to jointly undertake agricultural land use planning. Activities under this output will \nhelp identify areas that are better suited to rice production for maintaining ecosystem diversity. \nLinked to the zoning initiative, technical procedures will be modified to accommodate guidelines \nfor paddy production to ensure sustainable cultivation practices. \n \n15.  Output 3: Climate-resilient rice value chain infrastructure developed. This output \nincludes  high-priority  investments  in  three  major  rice-producing  provinces\u2014Battambang, \nKampong Thom, and Prey Veng and comprises (i) rehabilitating and climate proofing irrigation \nsystems;  (ii)  constructing  paddy  drying  and  storage  facilities;  and  (iii)  constructing  seed \ncleaning, drying, grading, and storage facilities. The investments have been identified and \nprioritized  based  on  provincial  development  priorities.21 Irrigation  rehabilitation  and  climate \nproofing will help increase productivity and cropping intensities. Establishment of paddy drying \nand storage facilities will accommodate paddy supplies at peak periods after harvest to ensure \nbetter quality for processing and retained added value in Cambodia.  Construction of seed \ncleaning, drying, grading, and storage facilities will contribute to increased availability of quality \nrice seed\u2014an integral component of rice quality improvement and a necessary prerequisite to \nsupplying export markets with rice of consistent quality. \n \n16.  Output  4:  Rice  value  chain  support  services  enhanced  to  improve  quality  of \nCambodian rice. This output comprises (i) improving availability and quality of commercial rice \n                                                \n21 List of Prescreened and Eligible Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nseed; (ii) upgrading technical extension material to guide production in various rice ecosystems; \n(iii) capacity building (technical and financial) of mill managers and operators; and (iv) facilitating \naccess to credit by farmers, traders, and millers. Activities under this output will improve the \nquality of milled rice and enhance Cambodia\u2019s participation in export markets. \n \n17.  Output  5:  Weather-indexed  crop  insurance  piloted.  This  output  comprises  (i) \nundertaking a detailed feasibility study to determine the appropriateness of a weather-indexed \ncrop insurance scheme; (ii) designing the operational parameters, product penetration plan, and \ninstitutional  arrangements;  and  (iii)  piloting  the  scheme  in  selected  areas  in  three  project \nprovinces. Activities under this output will reduce risks associated with paddy production and \nallow farmers to adopt modern production technologies and extend their longer-term planning \nhorizon.  Since  paddy  production  for  sales  will  become  an  increasingly  important  income \ncomponent of farming households, the proposed pilot will stimulate further commercialization. \n \n18.  Output  6:  Efficient  program  management  and  implementation.  This  output \ncomprises (i) effective project management, (ii) capacity building of the program management \noffice (PMO) and each national implementation office (NIO) and provincial implementation office \n(PIO),  and  (iii)  coordination  between  policy  development  and  investment  activities.  These \nactivities will be supported by consulting services for efficient implementation. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n19.  Implementation of the Rice Policy is estimated to cost the government about $600 \nmillion during 2010\u20132020. The policy adjustment cost to the government in implementing and \ncomplying with reform measures included in the policy matrix is estimated at $33.6 million.22 \nThe  government  has  requested  a  policy-based  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR15,955,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the policy reforms as \noutlined in its development policy letter and policy matrix. The policy-based loan will have a 24-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The policy-based loan will be disbursed in two tranches: a first tranche \nof SDR7,977,000 upon full compliance with the first tranche conditions, and a second tranche of \nSDR7,978,000 subject to full compliance with the second tranche conditions.23 \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $63.43 million equivalent (Table 1). The government has \nrequested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR20,608,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $14.6 million from the Global Agriculture \nand Food Security Program, a grant of $4.5 million and a loan of $5.0 million from the ADB \nStrategic Climate Fund (SCF) to help finance the project. The SCF loan will have a 40-year \nterm, including a grace period of 10 years, and an annual service charge of 0.1%. Principal \nrepayments for the SCF loan will be made at a rate of 2% of the loan per annum for years 11\u2013\n20 and 4% for years 20\u201340.

Manila. \n ", "8 \ninitial  technical  acceptability.  All  candidate  subprojects  will  be  evaluated  against  a  set  of \neligibility criteria prior to funding approval.27 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The program will address domestic distribution issues by minimizing price fluctuations \nacross provinces to ensure domestic food security and improved nutrition through improved \navailability of and access to rice. It will tackle these issues by (i) expanding capacity for drying \npaddy in target provinces by 2,000 tons per day by 2018, thereby improving quality and quantity \nof domestically milled rice; (ii) increasing the capacity for paddy storage in target provinces by \n40,000  tons  by  2018;  and  (iii)  facilitating  access  of  millers  to  finance  through  diversified \ncollateral arrangements to increase in-country milling and storage. \n \n25.  The program will increase the availability of quality seed, improve on-farm land water \nmanagement technologies, improve drying and storage capacities, and improve resilience of \nrice cultivation systems. These initiatives are expected to increase crop yields by 25% by 2019. \nAs a result, the program facilitates increased paddy production from 8.0 million tons in 2012 to \n9.5 million tons by 2018, and increased milled rice exports to 1.2 million tons in 2017 from \n200,000 tons in 2011. By 2017 and beyond, annual rice export revenue is expected to be $600 \nmillion (4.3% of GDP) or value added to the national economy of $120 million (0.9% of GDP).28  \nIncreased export revenue will help the government reduce its budget deficit (which was 6% in \n2012), replenish official foreign exchange reserves, and increase capacity for servicing external \ndebts. Moreover, the inflow of foreign exchange will enable importation of production inputs, \nwhich will have a significant multiplier impact on production, income generation, and nutrition.29 \nEconomic internal rate of returns of three representative subprojects are estimated in the range \nof 29%\u201331.2%, suggesting that investments under the program are economically viable.   \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The program is aligned with the government's public financial management reform and \nits decentralization and deconcentration initiatives that promote good governance and reduce \ncorruption. A governance risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared to ensure \nchecks and balances are in place. 30 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the MEF, MAFF, MIME, MLMUPC, and MOWRAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The program will promote inclusive economic growth.31 An improved rice value chain \nand increased productivity will induce price transmission gains from rice trade. These gains will \ntrickle down to about 1 million rice farming households, the majority of which are categorized as \nlow-income and food insecure. Since women comprise the majority working on farms, they will \nalso benefit the most from these gains. It is estimated that, by 2020, an individual household will \ngain an additional $300 annually; nationally this gain will be $300 million per annum. \n \n28.  Gender  and  development.  The  program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. It will enhance access of women farmers to decision making, resources, and \n                                                \n27  Subproject eligibility criteria are in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  National GDP for 2012 was estimated at $14 billion in current prices. \n29  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  The governance risk assessment and risk management plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n31  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nservices. Gender issues were incorporated into appropriate tranche conditions as stated in the \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4) and gender indicators included in all program outputs.32 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Resettlement (category B). Limited involuntary resettlement is envisaged under the \nprogram  because  the  screening  process  for  subprojects  prioritized  those  with  insignificant \nresettlement impacts. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems will not cause significant resettlement \nimpacts since works will be along existing rights of way. Development of paddy drying and \nstorage facilities will be located based on the availability of land for purchase on the open \nmarket. A resettlement framework and resettlement plans for two representative subprojects \nprepared by the executing agency were endorsed by the government and approved by ADB.33 \nThe resettlement framework and plans included a well-defined consultation mechanism, an \nentitlement matrix, and a rigorous monitoring mechanism.34 \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Socioeconomic surveys conducted in the project \nprovinces indicate that there were no indigenous peoples living around subprojects locations. \n \n31.  Environmental safeguards (category B). Policy reforms will enhance sustainable use \nand management of land and water in a changing climate. Initial environmental examinations, \nprepared for three representative subprojects, confirm that the three subprojects will not cause \nany adverse environmental impacts. All subprojects financed by the program will follow the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework, as disclosed on ADB website.35 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.

On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia (the Government), I am writing to request a \npolicy-based loan and an investment loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a loan and grant from \nthe Strategic Climate Fund under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, and a grant from the Global \nAgriculture and Food Security Program to implement the Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector \nDevelopment Program (Rice-SDP). Rice-SDP is designed to operationalize the government's policy on the \nPromotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export (the Rice Policy) approved by the Council of Ministers on \n25 July 2010. It is one of the major policy-based initiatives of the Government, stimulating growth and \npromoting Cambodia as a more significant participant in the international rice market while simultaneously \naddressing domestic rice distribution.  Both policy development and subproject investments  have been \nformulated through extensive discussions between ADB, the Government, and key sector stakeholders and \nare consistent with the Government's agri-cultural development strategies. Moreover, we note a thematic \nand strategic convergence of a number of recent ADB-financed projects and programs culminating in Rice \nSOP such as the Emergency Food Assistance Project, the Tonie Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder \nDevelopment Project, the Water Resources Management Sector Development Program, and the Emergency \nFlood Protection Project, each focusing on, amongst others, Cambodia's agricultural sector- and within it, \nthe development of the rice sub-sector. \n2.  The Government has identified the rice sub-sector as a major engine for socio-economic growth \nthrough  export  expansion.  However,  a  wide  range  of physical,  climatic,  agro-ecological  and  socio \neconomic factors influence rice production and export. the future is also confounded by the threat from \nclimate change to which Cambodia and its agriculture sector, in particular is most vulnerable as evidenced \nby recent floods, drought, salinity intrusion, land degradation, and loss of soil fe1tility. We recognize there \nremain areas where agricultural policy should be strengthened, together with the institutional framework \nnecessary to  support such policies that should  be  addressed  if the target of one million  tons  of rice \nexports by 2015, set by the Government, is to be achieved. The Government is fully committed to \ntlttrua 51\u00a3J wtniih'iii aru1tlsmm nt:lmsiimm !'itrt:ll  91fi1~ : cW~-1\u00a3Jm-t1li\u00a3J<S Q:lQ:l<S mum : r::I~~-I\u00a3Jm-<SI\u00a3Jt1l t1l5r::l \nSfUt ,92, Sangkat Watn  Phnonma,  khana Dva un Pe~nh , Phnom Pa enh, \"C AMnB ODIA.  ;hon:: 855-23-724 664  Fax: 855-;3-427 7~4 / ", "implement the policy and institutional development outcomes agreed under Rice-SDP as elaborated in the \nPolicy Matrix and ensure that maximum leverage will be obtained from the implementation of associated \ninvestment subprojects. \n3.  This  letter is  intended to show Cambodia as  a country eager and  capable of addressing these \ndevelopment challenges - by increasing resilience to adversities, man-made or natural, internal or external \neconomic shocks, and to forge ahead taking the necessary measures for accelerated broad-based growth led \nby the private sector. We believe that Cambodia's economy has the potential to grow at 7-8% per annum \nover next 20  years  and  beyond.  The  vision  is  to  offer equal  opportunity to  all,  whilst consolidating \nagriculture  as  a  key  economic  sector,  through  the  diversification  of rice  into  a  more  commercially \norientated sub-sector complemented by industrial development, trade and market liberalization policies. \nGiven the limited size of the domestic market, much of the growth stimulus will come from exploiting the \nrising demand for Cambodian rice on export markets. The interventions outlined in Rice-SDP design will \nsimultaneously enhance rice productivity destined for domestic markets to ensure food security, reduce \npoverty and malnutrition, and conserve Cambodia's natural resource base. \n4.  We  believe  that  a  coherent  national  planning  and  strategic  framework  is  needed  for  the \nimplementation of a major sector program initiative such as Rice-SDP. The Government has launched the \nRectangular Strategy on Growth,  Employment, Equity and Efficiency (Phase 2), which has agriculture \ndevelopment among  its  priorities.  The  four  strategic  \"growth  rectangles\"  are:  (i)  enhancement of the \nagricultural  sector,  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  construction  of physical  infrastructure,  (iii)  private  sector \ndevelopment and employment generation, and (iv) capacity development and human resource development. \n5.  The Government has adopted the Updated National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) (2009-13) \nwith milled rice as a major export item. It directs 62.4% of resources to rural areas, with increased attention \nto production activities including agriculture (which is dominated by rice) and rural development, and to \nhealth  and  education for  human  capital  development.  With this,  Cambodia will  make  rapid  progress \ntowards achieving its Millennium Development Goals. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries \n(MAFF) has prepared the Agricultural Strategic Development Plan 2009-13 in line with the updated NSDP. \n6.  In  the  past decade,  Cambodia grew rapidly,  reducing poverty,  largely due to  macro-economic \nstability and public financial management reform whilst maintaining a private sector focus.  Fiscal and \nmonetary policies have been prudent. Cambodia's gross domestic product growth averaged 11% per annum \nduring the period 2004-07  before declining with the  financial  crisis.  The government-driven  stimulus \nprogram and proactive measures supported by ADB-financed projects and those of other development \npartners helped the Government through the financial crisis. The resultant economic recovery has been \nstrong with impressive growth being recorded  in  agriculture (through rice commercialization), tourism, \ngarments, real estate, trade and the services sector, that are dominated by small and medium enterprises. \nEconomic growth for 2012 is estimated at 7.3% while the medium-term projection is 7-8% per annum. \nDuring the boom period, poverty levels (as measured by the recently revised poverty line) declined from \n4 7.8% in 2007, to 19.8% in 2011. Notwithstanding slight inflationary pressure of recent months, prices and \nexchange rates have been stable. Interest rates have declined due to increased competition among banks and \nmicrofinance institutions. \n7.  The Government's Rice Policy elaborates short, medium and  longer-term measures to  improve \npaddy production, collection and processing, logistics, marketing and institutional mechanism and is being \nimplemented  through  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies.  MAFF  has  prepared  an  Action  Plan  to \nimplement this Policy. Other ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Land Management, Urban \nPlanning and  Construction,  the  Ministry of Commerce, the  Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of \nIndustry, Mines and Energy, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology each have identified \ntheir responsibilities under the Rice Policy. \n8.  Rice-SDP  will  support the  Government  in  addressing  two  areas:  (i)  enhancing capacities  for \nachieving conducive policy and enabling environment for rice commercialization, and (ii) strengthening \nvertical  linkages  and  horizontal clusters along,  and  within,  the rice value chain.  Strengthened vettical \n2 ", "linkages  between rice  producers,  processors  and  marketing agents  will  provide  a  valuable  means  for \norganizing and delivering quality seed material (a necessary pre-requisite for improved quality of paddy \nbeing delivered for processing), technical support services, and aggregated marketing activities. \n9.  Seed quality, production capacity, prices paid and distribution channels are areas of concern for the \nGovernment. Seed quality is the initial critical input in the rice value chain that determines future quality \npotential with all subsequent activities being dependent upon farmers' ability to access adequate quantities \nof quality seed.  Cambodia Agriculture Research and Development Institute (CAROl), MAFF research \nstations, commercial seed producers, and farmer associations have limited capacity to produce high quality, \ncertified and commercial seed in sufficient quantities. Many seeds are retained from the previous season's \ncrop  while significant quantities are  still  imported.  The Government is  concerned with export of rice \nvarieties based on imported seed due to intellectual property rights issues. The Government wishes to build \nthe sub-sector on the high quality indigenous Cambodian rice varieties for export. \n10.  The  Government  will  put  in  place  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  seed  production \ncertification  and  distribution.  Recognizing  that  an  umbrella  seed  policy  will  strengthen  local  seed \nproduction and distribution, the Government (MAFF- the responsible agency) has drafted a 'Seed Policy' \nprior to the release of the first tranche of the policy-based loan. The second tranche condition will be the \nissuance of the draft Seed Policy by MAFF. \n11.  Consistent with this Seed Policy, we recognize the need for MAFF to (i) draft the 'National Seed \nStandards,' (ii) draft the 'Prakas on Procedures for Providing Seed Quality Certification,' (iii) draft the \n'General Introduction to the Examination of Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability of New Varieties of \nPlants,' and (iv) draft the 'Guidelines for the Conduct of Tests for Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability \nof Rice'. All these four documents have been drafted as pre-conditions for the release of the first tranche of \nthe  policy  loan.  The second tranche condition  will  be the  approval  of these draft documents  by  the \nrespective authorities. We believe, in non-emergency situations, seed should be produced and distributed on \na commercial basis to encourage private investment in the seed industry. The Government will also take \nrelated actions supp011ed by Rice-SOP including strengthening capacity for quality assurance through seed \ntesting and certification. \n12.  We  recognize  that  efficient  and  sustainable  land  management  is  an  important  aspect  of rice \ncommercialization. The Government is concerned about agricultural land-use inefficiency due to the lack of \nadequate zoning,  poor  land  management practices, and  inadequate agricultural  land-use  planning.  Soil \nproductivity mapping, land classification and land-use zoning remain incomplete. The legal framework for \nland-use is the stat1ing point, based on the existing 2001 Land Law which itself, is currently under review. \nThe Government has issued a National Policy on Spatial Planning and is keen to ensure that land is used in \naccordance with its potential and longer-term balance between socio-economic development and protection \nof the environment. Within this framework, a subordinate Land Policy \"White Paper\", including a chapter \non Land and Gender Policy has been drafted as the condition for the release of the first tranche of the \npolicy-based loan. The \"White Paper\" will be issued as a condition for the release of the second tranche of \nthe policy-based loan. \n13.  With the above as guiding documents,  it is  necessary for MAFF to prepare and submit to the \nCouncil of Ministers, a draft Law on Management and Use of Agricultural Land, focusing inter alia, on (i) \nwomen's access to information on land administration, management and distribution; (ii) women's equal \nparticipation and representation in all commissions and committees; and (iii) equal benefits for women in \nland related initiatives. The Government is committed to promoting sustainable land management, and will \nensure  that  MAFF  prepares  and  the  Government  adopts  a  national  action  program  to  combat  land \ndegradation in Cambodia. To assist in this matter, MAFF will issue guidelines for establishing agricultural \nland-use zones, incorporating measures and targets for involving women in planning and decision making. \n14.  The Government believes farmer organizations will play a vital role in the implementation of rice \ncommercialization  strategies,  policies  and  investments.  The  Government  is  therefore  committed  to \nstrengthen agricultural cooperatives. MAFF, through  its extension staff,  will assist in  the formation  of \n3 ", "farmer cooperatives. The Law on Agricultural Cooperatives has been drafted by MAFF (a first tranche \ncondition) to assist in registration of existing cooperatives and in the establishment of new ones, training \ncooperatives to become well managed business entities. Rice-SDP supp01t is available to broaden the base \nof farmer  organizations  and  strengthen  their  capacities.  The  second  tranche  condition  requires  the \nsubmission of the draft Law to the National Assembly. \n15.  We recognize contract farming arrangements offer potential to achieve quality and dependable \nsupplies if it is established over a period of time building long-term relationships. The Government has \nissued a Sub-decree on Contract Fanning. Under Rice-SDP, paddy producers and associations (especially \nfemale  headed  households)  will  receive  assistance  to  enter  into  contracts  with  interested  parties  on \nfavorable terms, regularize (register) the contract and enforce compliance with its provisions. \n16.  The Government will take measures to establish Cambodian milled rice standards and facilitate \ndomestic trading and export of rice. The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy, in consultation with \nrelevant ministries and the private sector, has issued the general standard specifications for milled rice (a \nfirst tranche condition). This will be extended to  10  varieties of Cambodian rice as  a  second tranche \ncondition. The capacities of MAFF and the Institute of Standards of Cambodia will be enhanced to ce1tify \nrice standards. \n17.  We recognize the importance of maintaining and improving competitiveness of Cambodian rice in \nthe international market. To this end, the Government will address sanitary and phyto-sanita1y concerns by \nhaving drafted (a first tranche condition) the Law on Plant Protection and Phyto-sanitary Measures and \nsubmitting the draft Law to the National Assembly (a second tranche condition). On a related matter, \nchemical residues from the application of agricultural chemicals to growing crops can seriously affect the \nacceptance of produce from such crops on international markets. In order to maintain competitiveness and \nguard against such threats, the Law on the Management of Pesticides and Fertilizers was recently adopted \n(a first tranche condition). \n18.  We believe implementation ofthe reform package and investment subprojects under Rice-SDP will \ngo a long way to realize objectives of the Government's Rice Policy. \n'.-:::::L,'sm!t~l'!m.on \nDeputy Prime Minister \nMinister of Economy and Finance \n4 ", "           \nPOLICY MATRIX \n \nPolicy  Policy Actions for the Release of the Second \nPolicy Actions for the Release of the First Tranche \ninitiative/objective  Tranche \nOutput: A Conducive Legal and Regulatory Environment Established to Facilitate Rice Commercialization \n1.1.
