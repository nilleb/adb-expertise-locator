It  will  (i)  rehabilitate  about  890  kilometers  (km)  of  trunk \nroads, (ii) introduce performance-based road maintenance on a pilot basis for 164 km of trunk \nroads,  (iii)  set  up  a  road  asset  management  system,  and  (iv)  implement  an  institutional \ndevelopment plan.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nYunnan is poor, mountainous, and, with 46 million people, densely populated. Because \n3. \nthe  province  is  landlocked,  trade  with  the  rest  of  the  PRC  and  with  foreign  countries  involves \nland  transport  over  long  distances,  which  makes  its  products  less  competitive.  The  large \npockets  of  poverty  that  exist  in the  province  are  linked  to  inadequate road  access,  the  limited \navailability of land, and cultural barriers to outmigration. In 2011, 27% of Yunnan\u2019s rural people \nwere living under the PRC\u2019s official poverty line of CNY2,300 in annual income.  \n \n4. \nYunnan  is  strategically  located  along  the  PRC\u2019s  border  with  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam.  About  60%  of  freight  and  80%  of  passenger \ntransport  is  by  road.  The  Yunnan  Highway  Administration  Bureau  (YHAB)  of  the  Yunnan \nProvincial  Department  of  Transport  (YPDOT)  manages  a  trunk  road  network  of  24,089  km, \nincluding  45%  of  the  province\u2019s  paved  roads.  These  roads  connect  with  or  form  part  of  the \nnorthern and north\u2013south transport corridors of the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n5. \nWith strong support from central government, Yunnan has invested heavily in upgrading \nits transport network, and allotted an amount equivalent to 10% of the provincial gross domestic \nproduct in 2011. Nonetheless, the trunk road network has been inadequately maintained and is \noften  in  poor  condition.  This  reduces  the  province\u2019s  economic  competitiveness  and  slows  the \npace of poverty reduction. In 2011, YHAB rated only 37% of the trunk road network as being in \ngood condition; about 31% of the network was designated as very poor. The project preparatory \nTA consultant estimated that the pavement on almost one-half of the roads will soon need to be \ncompletely reconstructed. Despite this, traffic on the network has been rapidly increasing, which \nnot  only  further  damages  substandard  roads  but  threatens  to  degrade  newly  built  ones \nprematurely. Yunnan\u2019s economy is therefore suffering the effects of a vicious cycle afflicting the \ntrunk road network. Overemphasis on new road construction, along with funding and spending \ninefficiencies,  leaves  little  budget  for  necessary  maintenance.  The  lack  of  maintenance \nincreases  the  life  cycle  cost  of  pavement  care  and  thus  widens  the  future  maintenance \ndemand\u2013resource gap.  \n \n6. \nPoor  trunk  road  conditions  have  also  reduced  road  safety.  In  2009,  the  risk  of  being \nkilled  in  a  road  accident  on  the  network  was  almost  five  times  the  rate  in  some  developed \ncountries\u201430  fatalities  per  billion  vehicle-kilometers,  compared  to  about  6  in  France  and  the \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nUnited  Kingdom.  Although  the  road  fatality  rate  has  fallen  since  2004,  it  could  rise  again  as \ntraffic  volume  increases  on  older  roads  that  are  being  ill-maintained  and  therefore  becoming \nmore dangerous to use.  \n \nThe project design is based on a detailed analysis of how to make Yunnan\u2019s trunk road \n7. \nnetwork more sustainable. The network\u2019s current condition is the product of YHAB\u2019s historically \nlow  maintenance  budgets  and  high management  costs.  In 2011,  YHAB\u2019s  maintenance budget \nreached $350 million, or about $14,600 per network km. Of that total $263 million was spent on \nlabor  and  management  costs,  $47  million  on  routine  maintenance  and  only  $40  million  on \nrehabilitation works. If past trends continue, future revenue increases will be absorbed by rising \nstaff  costs.  Meanwhile,  road  condition  modeling  studies  show  that  the  share  of  the  network  in \nvery poor condition may rise from 31% in 2011 to 40% in 2016 and 50% by 2021. To stop the \ndegradation and bring the network to a generally good condition, YHAB will need to double its \nmaintenance  budget  over  a  10-year  period.  Such  additional  spending  on  rehabilitation  works \nwould bring economic benefits to Yunnan worth 6\u201310 times the costs.3 \n \nThe  project  also  envisages  raising  the  cost-effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  YHAB \n8. \nmaintenance spending. As is a common practice in the PRC, YHAB uses its own work force to \ncarry  out  maintenance.  International  experience  has  shown,  however,  that  outsourcing \nmaintenance,  particularly  through  performance-based  contracts,  can  substantially  reduce \ncosts.4 Improved  maintenance  planning  and  programming  methods  would  help to  make  better \nuse  of  YHAB  resources.  Road  condition  modeling  studies  show  that  using  a  road  asset \nmanagement  system  and  prioritizing  works  based  on  works\u2019  economic  returns  would  increase \nthe economic benefits of YHAB maintenance by 20% (footnote 3). \n \n9. \nMaking road maintenance in the PRC more sustainable is a strategic objective under the \ngovernment\u2019s  12th  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015).  The  government  intends  to  achieve  this  by \nraising  the  priority  accorded  to  maintenance  relative  to  construction;  increasing  road \nrehabilitation efforts; reducing management costs and improving the efficiency of maintenance; \nand  introducing  market-based  delivery  mechanisms  on  a  pilot  basis.  It  is  also  emphasizing \ngreater road safety, the strengthening of environmental management practices, and the use of \nmodern maintenance planning systems. To reach these goals, YPDOT established a series of \nmedium-term targets for road maintenance through policy dialogue with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). YPDOT aims to (i) raise the proportion of roads rated in good condition from 40% \nof  the  trunk  road  network  in  2011  to  50%  in  2017,  (ii)  reduce  the  gap  between  maintenance \nfinancing  needs  and budgets from  an  estimated  50% to about  20%,  (iii)  increase  the share  of \nthe  network  that  is  rehabilitated  each  year  from  0.5%  to  4.0%,  and  (iv)  modernize  YHAB\u2019s \nmanagement systems and operational processes. \n \n10. \nYunnan\u2019s  road  maintenance  strategy  entails  policy  and  institutional  changes.  The \ngovernment  has  committed  to  increase  YHAB\u2019s  maintenance  budget  resources  to  about  $550 \nmillion  annually  in  2017,  or  $24,000  per  km.  This  is  to  be  done  initially  by  supplementing \nYHAB\u2019s  budgetary  resources  with  loans  from  development  partners  and  gradually  increasing \nfuel  tax  allocations  to  YHAB  from  CNY1.7  billion  in  2011  to  CNY3.0  billion  in  2017,  with \nadditional  resources  to  be  spent  on  rehabilitation.  To  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiency, \nYHAB  will  also  gradually  outsource  road maintenance operations  and reduce its  management \nand  staff  costs.  Institutional  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  establishing  a  road  asset \n\n                                                \n3   Road Network Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4   See, for example, World Bank. 2009.

Washington, DC. \n\n\fmanagement  system,  creating  the  internal  capacity  and  skills  necessary  to  manage  the \nenvironmental and social impacts of road maintenance  works, and monitoring progress toward \nthe  road  sector  targets.  YHAB  will  incorporate  road  safety  improvements  in  the  rehabilitation \nworks it undertakes.  \n  \n11. \nThese  changes  will  be  rolled  out  gradually  with  project  support.  Four  documents \ndeveloped  during  project  preparation  will  guide  implementation:  (i)  a road  sector  maintenance \nstrategy;  (ii)  an  institutional  development  plan;  (iii)  a  road  sector  roadmap  that  sets  annual \ntargets  for  key  performance  and  sustainability  indicators,  as  well  as  policy  reform  milestones; \nand  (iv)  an  operational  manual.  The  manual  will  be  used  to  improve  YHAB\u2019s  processes  for \nplanning;  environmental,  social,  and  safety  management;  monitoring  systems;  and \nprocurement.5  \n \n12. \nThe  government  has  asked  ADB  to  support  YHAB\u2019s  trunk  road  maintenance  program \nand  assist  in  sector  reform  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  project  represents  a  second \nphase of ADB support to road maintenance in Yunnan. In 2010, ADB approved lending support \nfor,  among  others,  rehabilitation  by  YHAB  of  605  km  of  trunk  roads,  and  also  helped  YPDOT \npilot  new  forms  of  rural  road  maintenance.  6 The  project  draws  on  lessons  from  past  ADB \nprojects for road maintenance by adopting a sector approach that can address Yunnan\u2019s trunk \nroad maintenance needs, key sector issues, and institutional constraints more comprehensively \nthan has been done in the past. ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is appropriate for a project that \ncomprises about 30 small-scale subprojects that are dispersed throughout Yunnan and must be \nimplemented  in  phases.  The  project  qualifies  for  this  modality  because  a  sector  development \nplan  exists,  the institutions  involved  have the capacity  required,  and  it supports  policy  reforms \nthat are mandated under the country\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan. By targeting a poor province and by \nadvancing the agendas of road asset management and safety, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nPRC  country  partnership  strategy  for  2011\u201320157 and  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative \nOperational Plan.8   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact of the project will be improved access for the people of Yunnan to a quality \nand  safe  trunk  road  network.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  sustainability  of  Yunnan\u2019s  trunk \nroad network.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe  project  will  deliver  four  outputs:  (i)  890  km  of  trunk  roads  rehabilitated, \n(ii) performance-based  road  maintenance  piloted  for  164  km  of  trunk  roads,  (iii)  road  asset \nmanagement system enhanced, and (iv) institutional capacity of YHAB strengthened.  \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Trunk Road Rehabilitation \n\n15. \nRehabilitation program. The project will restore about 890 km of trunk road pavements \nto good condition through asphalt overlays on about 180 km of road and the reconstruction of \n\n                                                \n5   Sector  Maintenance  Strategy,  Institutional  Development  Plan,  Road  Sector  Roadmap,  and  Operational  Manual \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n6   ADB.  2010.

Manila.  \n\n7   ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n8   ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\npavement  on  710 km  of  road.  The  estimated cost is  $208.7  million,  $67.8 million  of which will \ncome  from  the  ADB  loan.  The  project  is  part  of  YHAB\u2019s  2013\u20132016  program  to  overlay, \nstrengthen,  or  reconstruct  pavement  on  about  2,250  km  of  trunk  highways.  The  program \nprioritizes  (i) pavement  strengthening,  reconstruction,  or  asphalt  overlay  for  roads  with  high \ntraffic of more than 2,000 vehicles per day that are rated in poor or very poor condition, and (ii) \npavement reconstruction for roads with medium traffic of 1,000\u20132,000 vehicles per day that are \nalready  rated  in  very  poor  condition.  Where  the  sub-base  has  failed,  pavement  will  be \nreconstructed. Where the pavement is still in fair condition but shows signs of deterioration, an \nasphalt overlay will be applied to extend pavement life. Where current or future traffic is higher \nthan planned for in the road\u2019s original design, the pavement will be strengthened.  \n \n16. \nSubprojects. The works will be implemented in four phases, corresponding to YHAB\u2019s \nannual road maintenance plans for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Seven highway sections of 192 \nkm in total length were selected for phase I of the project based on their high traffic volume and \npoor condition.9 The roads were built 20\u201340 years ago, with satisfactory geometry and adequate \ncapacity,  but  the  pavement  has  failed  due  to  age  and  heavy  traffic.  At  the  start  of  the  three \nsubsequent annual phases, YHAB will identify highway segments that require rehabilitation, and \ngive  priority  to  the  maintenance  works  that  bring  the  highest  economic  returns.  This  will  be \ndetermined  through  evaluation  using  a  road  asset  management  system  and  data  from  annual \ntraffic and road condition surveys. YHAB will prepare data on each subproject to be considered, \nwith information on its rationale; environmental, social, and road safety assessments; technical \nsolutions;  cost  estimates;  economic  evaluation;  and  schedule.  Subprojects  will  conform  to  the \nagreed selection criteria, as confirmed by YHAB and endorsed by ADB.10  \n \nSafety  enhancement.  The  project  will  take  steps  to  improve  road  safety  on  the \n17. \nsubproject  roads.  YHAB  will  coordinate  road  safety  education  activities  with  schools,  village \ngroups, and local governments after works are completed. The rehabilitation will include safety \nfeature upgrades such as better signage, rumble strips, and improved grade and curve design. \nThe safety features to be undertaken will be chosen based on an assessment procedure set out \nin the manual prepared for the project. The operational manual provides a guide for classifying \nsafety  risks  as  very  high,  high,  moderate,  and  low,  and  prescribes  the  type  and  extent  of  the \nsafety features needed to match the level of risk. Based on preliminary design, about 10% of the \ncost  of  the  phase  I  subprojects  will  be  allocated  to  safety  features.  YHAB  will  conduct  an \nindependent road safety audit of all subprojects at the detailed design and completion stages.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Performance-Based Road Maintenance \n\n18. \nThe project will introduce performance-based road maintenance on a pilot basis. Under \nthe  performance-based  road  maintenance  schemes,  contractors  will  be  paid  for  consistently \nmaintaining  the  road  at  a  contractually  stated  performance  standard  over  several  years.  This \ndiffers from other mechanisms linking payments to inputs, or outputs. To increase the potential \nfor  lessons  and  replication,  the  project  will  pilot  two  performance-based  modalities,  one  using \noutsourcing and the other a contract with YHAB\u2019s own maintenance work force. \n \nThe  first  pilot  will  be  for  ADB-funded  rehabilitation  and  routine  maintenance  of  a  57  km \n19. \nsegment of the G-323 highway in Wenshan Prefecture over 5 years. This will test the feasibility of \ncontracting-out  of  performance-based  maintenance  operations.  During  the  first  year,  the \n\n                                                \n9  ADB financing will be applied to four subprojects on highways G213, G320, and S211. The government will fully \n\nfinance three subprojects on G108, S321, and X214.  \n\n10 Subproject Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n\fcontractor  will  reconstruct  40  km  of  pavement  and  overlay  an  additional  17  km.  During  the \nfollowing 4 years, the contractor will undertake routine maintenance. The second pilot, funded by \nYHAB, will be for the periodic and the routine maintenance of a network of 107 km of paved roads \nwithin Ruili County in Dehong Prefecture for 3 years. This will test the feasibility of improving the \nefficiency of YHAB\u2019s internally delivered maintenance operations by introducing contractual and \nperformance-based  mechanisms.  To  implement  the  pilot,  YHAB  will  enter  into  a  contractual \narrangement with its Ruili County maintenance section at a negotiated contract price and with a \nperformance agreement. An independent supervision engineer will undertake monthly inspections \nto  assess  compliance  with  the  performance  standards  under  each  of  the  pilots.  In  case  of \nnonperformance, YHAB will make only partial payments to the contractor.11   \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Road Asset Management System \n\n20. \nThe project will introduce and launch a computerized road asset management system in \nYHAB.  A  new  road  database  will  consolidate  YHAB\u2019s  existing  road  inventory,  road  condition, \nequipment,  and  traffic  databases.  The  highway  network  will  be  spatially  referenced  and  use  a \ngeographic  information  system.  The  system  will  also  include  (i)  a  road  condition  evaluation \nsystem, (ii) a pavement management system, (iii) a routine maintenance management system, \nand (iv) an interface with Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4) software for \nworks  planning.  It  will  make  information  on  road  conditions  available  online  through  a  traffic \ninformation  subsystem.  To  set  up  and  maintain  the  road  asset  management  system,  the \nYunnan  Scientific  Research  Institute  under  YHAB  will  carry  out  pavement  condition  surveys \neach year and update the road inventory. This system will be used by YHAB as an input in the \npreparation of annual and medium-term maintenance strategies and programs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput 4: Institutional Development \n\n21. \nThe  project  will  increase  YHAB\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  new  approaches  to  road \nmaintenance,  help  implement  the  road  sector  maintenance  strategy  and  the  institutional \ndevelopment plan, and assist in monitoring the road sector roadmap. \n \n22. \nEnvironment,  social,  and  safety  management.  YHAB  will  establish  a  new \nenvironment, social,  and safety  unit  (ESSU) with  three full-time staff  members.  The ESSU will \nhelp YHAB to (i) ensure that the project meets environmental, social, and safety requirements; \n(ii) conduct  road  safety  audits,  consultations,  and  environmental  and  social  assessments; \n(iii) develop  environmental  management  instructions  for  maintenance  works;  (iv)  prepare  road \nsafety  engineering  guidelines  and  design  and  evaluate  safety  engineering  measures;  and  (v) \nmonitor YHAB\u2019s environmental, social, and safety performance. \n \n23. \nPerformance  and  sustainability  assessment.  The  project  will  strengthen  YHAB\u2019s \nperformance  management.  YHAB  will  prepare  a  performance  and  sustainability  assessment \nreport  each  year  and  submit  it  to  ADB  (footnote  11).  The  report  will  give  a  comprehensive \npicture  of  YHAB\u2019s  maintenance  program, \nits  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \nmanagement  performance,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  its  environmental,  social,  and  safety \nmanagement  processes.  YHAB  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  progress,  based  on  the  indicators \nand  annual  targets  set  out  in  the  road  sector  roadmap,  and  agree  on  any  remedial  action \nneeded.  \n \n\nincluding \n\n                                                \n11  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nProject  management.  A  project  management  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  provide \n24. \nsupport  to  YHAB  to  implement  the  project;  select  and  prepare  the  subprojects  for  its  second, \nthird, and fourth phases; provide training for the staff of the new ESSU; and advise in setting up \nthe ESSU procedures and guidelines.  \n \n25. \nTraining. The project will finance a 4-year program to provide training abroad and in the \nPRC  for  YHAB  personnel.  The  personnel  will  receive  100  person-months  of  international \ntraining  and  about  500  person-months  of  training  in-country  in  road maintenance  engineering, \nroad asset management, performance-based maintenance, and the management of road safety \nand environmental and social safeguards.  \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe project is estimated to cost $232.4 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na  loan  of  $80.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The \nloan  will  have  a  28-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,12 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  government  will  meet  the  cost  of  financing \ncharges during implementation.  \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The  ADB  loan will finance 34.42%  of  the  total  project \ncosts.13 Counterpart funds  will come from the  Yunnan  provincial  government.  The government \nwill finance any shortfall that may arise during implementation.  The government will relend the \nproceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  Yunnan  provincial  government  upon  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to ADB, and the Yunnan provincial government will make the proceeds of the loan \navailable to YHAB pursuant to onlending arrangements on terms and conditions satisfactory to \n\n                                                \n12  The  interest  includes  a  maturity  premium  of  20  basis  points.  This  is  based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  the \n\ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates.  \n\n13  ADB  financing  under  the  Wenshan  pilot  will  be  front-loaded  since  (i)  this  contract  will  extend  beyond  the \nimplementation schedule for the remainder of the project, (ii) it would not involve material risk for the success of the \nproject, and (iii) it will enable timely loan closure. \n\n\fADB,  with  the  provision  of  a  guarantee  of  the  obligation  to  repay  being  issued  by  YPDOT. \nDetailed onlending arrangements are in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nYunnan Provincial Government \n \n\nAmount ($ million) \n80.00 \n152.40 \n232.40 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n34.42 \n65.58 \n100.00 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nYPDOT  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \n28. \nproject.

The  preliminary \ndesign of first-year works was prepared by the project preparatory TA. Maintenance and safety \npolicies and guidelines are detailed in the operational manual (footnote 5). Pavement repairs will \ninclude  various  technical  solutions,  including  local  repairs,  slurry  seals,  double  bituminous \nsurface  treatment,  concrete  asphalt  overlay,  and  reconstruction  (asphalt  overlay  or  surface \ntreatment over cement-treated gravel). Safety works will include provision of shoulders, lay-bys, \nsteep  grade  management,  left-turn  lanes  at  busy  junctions,  basic  and  enhanced  centerline \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmarkings,  safety  barriers,  footpaths  on  sections  near  villages  and  towns,  nonmotorized  traffic \nlanes, and traffic calming measures.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe primary economic benefit of the road maintenance works will be a reduction in the \ncosts of transport (vehicle operating costs and time costs) along Yunnan\u2019s trunk roads by up to \n40%.  The  subprojects  to  be  implemented  in  the  first  year  of  the  project  have  an  economic \ninternal rate of return of 34%. Sensitivity analysis showed that (i) under a worst-case scenario, \nincluding a substantial drop in the benefits by 66% and a 200% cost increase, the project would \nstill yield an economic rate of return of about 14%; and (ii) the investment costs would need to \nbe multiplied by 8 or the benefits be divided by 10 to yield a net present value equal to zero. A \nfinancial analysis indicated that, with respect to the availability of resources to cover the project \ncost and the loan service requirements, the project presents only a small financial risk.  \n\n \nProcurement and Governance \n\nC. \n\n31. \nAll  procurement  for  ADB-financed  contracts  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement for ADB-financed civil works under outputs \n1  and  2  will  use  the  2012  Ministry  of  Finance  standard  bidding  documents  for  national \ncompetitive bidding agreed upon with ADB and the World Bank in 2012. For non-ADB financed \nworks  and  services,  YHAB  will  use  government  procurement  procedures.14 Procurement  and \nfinancial  assessments  were  carried  out  as  part  of  project  preparation.  Financial  management \nrisk  is  considered  low,  while  the  procurement  risk  is  rated  average  based  on  YHAB\u2019s  limited \nprior experience with ADB. To mitigate the risk, YHAB will recruit a procurement agent, and staff \ninvolved  in  the  project  will  receive  training  in  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  guidelines. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained to  and  discussed  with \nthe  government  and  YPDOT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote  11).  An  institutional  assessment \ncarried  out  by  ADB  concluded  that  YHAB\u2019s  capacity  to  execute  the  project  was  generally \nappropriate  but  that  it  needed  strengthening  in  the  areas  of  planning,  safety,  environmental \nmanagement, and procurement.15  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nThe project will benefit an estimated 12 million people, of whom 85% are rural residents. \nThe subprojects to be implemented in the first year of the project will directly benefit 4.17 million \npeople in five prefectures and 15 counties. The project preparatory TA consultant evaluated the \nimpact  of  recently  completed  pavement  rehabilitation  works  in  Yunnan.  The  evaluation  shows \nthat the poor, particularly women, quickly benefited from increased transport opportunities once \nworks  were  completed.  Specific  impacts  identified  include:  (i)  greater  and  more  diversified \nincome-generating  opportunities  for  households,  including  seasonal  work-related  migration \nopportunities; (ii) more reliable, frequent, and cheaper public transport, which benefitted women \nin  particular;  (iii)  more  timely  transport  of  farm  products  over  the  improved    roads,  which  was \nespecially  important  to  ensure  that  perishable  commodities  such  as  fruits,  vegetables,  and \nflowers arrived at markets in good condition; (iv) a reduction in farm input costs due to improved \ntransport  from  providers;  (v)  more  small  business  activity  alongside  the  roads;  (vi)  improved \n\n                                                \n14  Government procurement procedures include limited bidding for rehabilitation works. ADB assessed the efficiency \n\nof the procedures and concluded that YHAB could carry them out diligently and efficiently.  \n\n15  The findings are summarized in the Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n\fconnectivity  and  fewer  road  accidents,  especially  during  the  rainy  season;  and  (vii)  less  dust \ngenerated by traffic in areas along the improved roads. \n \n33. \nTo  maximize  the  social  benefits  and  minimize  risks,  YHAB  will  implement  a  social \ndevelopment  action  plan  to  undertake such steps  as  (i) facilitation  of  public transport services, \n(ii)  communication  with  local  stakeholders,  (iii) provision  of  employment  and  other  income \nopportunities during the works, and (iv) prevention of HIV/AIDS spread.16  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  environmental  management  plan  was  prepared  for  the  seven \nsubprojects chosen for rehabilitation during phase 1 (footnote 9)  and the pilot testing of the two \nperformance-based  road  maintenance  modalities.  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s \nregulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and were disclosed on \nthe ADB website on 25 April 2013. Two of the subprojects have been classified as category B, \nand  the  rest  as  category  C.  The  works  will  be  confined  to  the  original  right-of-way  of  existing \nnational,  provincial,  and  county  roads.  All  identified  environmental  impacts  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  activities  under  the  environmental  management  plan.  An  environmental  assessment \nreview  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  assessment  of  subprojects  to  be  identified \nand  carried  out  later  under  the  project\u2019s  three  subsequent  phases.  YHAB  accepted  PPTA \nrecommendations  to  increase  its  environmental  capacity,  and  tools  have  been  developed  to \nmanage environmental impacts and opportunities associated with maintenance activities (PAM, \npara. 65). \n \n35. \nSocial  safeguards. Due diligence indicated that no land acquisition or resettlement will \nbe  required  for  the  first-year  subprojects.  While  the  subprojects  yet  to  be  selected  for  the \nremaining phases are expected to be similar, the project was classified as resettlement category \nB  to  allow  for  changes  at  detailed  design  stage  if  a  future  subproject  involves  modest \nresettlement due to road widening or straightening or to improve safety features. A resettlement \nframework and a sample resettlement plan have been prepared and were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite  on  25  April  2013.  Should  a  subproject  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement,  the \nexecuting  agency  will  prepare  and  submit  resettlement  plan(s)  for  ADB  review  and  clearance; \nthis  will  include  a  participatory  consultation  process,  and  other  measures  defined  in  the \nresettlement  framework.  The  project  will  not  finance  a  subproject  that  requires  significant \nresettlement.  Due  diligence  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  TA  found  no  significant \nadverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  that  would  trigger  the  indigenous \npeoples safeguard requirements, hence the project is classified as indigenous peoples category \nC.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n16  The social development action plan is included in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient financing is made available for \nmedium-term road maintenance.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport has committed to \ngradually raising YHAB\u2019s allocation of fuel tax resources. \n\nYHAB lacks capacity to properly select \nand appraise subsequent subprojects. \n\nThe project management consultant will help select and appraise the \nsubprojects under the project\u2019s final three phases. \n\nYHAB has too little knowledge of the \nneeded modern approaches to road \nmaintenance.  \n\nThe operational manual describes the new processes. YHAB will recruit \na project management consultant and conduct capacity-building \nactivities. \n\nRoad safety risks increase after the \nproject road improvements.  \n\nThe road safety of phase I subprojects will be assessed. Risk mitigation \nmeasures will be included in detailed design of all subprojects.  \n\nYHAB = Yunnan Highway Administration Bureau. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n37. \nThe government and YPDOT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents.  \n \n38. \nThe  government  and  YPDOT  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The government and \nYPDOT  have  further  agreed  that  YPDOT  and  YHAB  shall  not  award  any  works  contract  in \nrespect of works under phases II, III and IV of output 1 until YPDOT, YHAB and ADB shall have \nconcluded a memorandum of understanding in respect of the corresponding phase, following a \njoint  review  of  preparatory  steps,  including  selection  of  the  proposed  subprojects  for  the \nupcoming phase, and of the status of agreed measures under the road sector roadmap. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$80,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Yunnan Sustainable Road Maintenance \n(Sector)  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  28  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n5 November 2013 \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \nImpact \nThe people of \nYunnan have \nimproved access to \na quality and safe \ntrunk road network.  \n \n\nOutcome \nThe sustainability of \nYunnan\u2019s trunk road \nnetwork Improved. \n\nOutputs \n1.
