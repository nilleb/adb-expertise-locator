The Project will be implemented via a sector approach. \n\nOn 2 April 2007, a massive undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami \nthat  struck  Western  and  Choiseul  provinces.  Islands  in  these  two \nprovinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to  housing,  infrastructure, \nschools, and medical facilities; and several villages were destroyed. An \nestimated  20,000  people  of  a  total  population  of  90,000  have  been \naffected,  with  about  5,000  people  displaced  and  52  dead.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  damage  and  loss  assessment,  prepared  with  support \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank,  and  United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n\nThe  affected  area  generates  a  disproportionate  share  of \nSolomon Islands\u2019  national  output  and  almost  all  of  its  tourism.  The \neffects  of  the  disaster  thus  have  national  economic  implications. \nRecovery and rehabilitation will depend on restoring access to affected \nareas  and  maintaining  public  health.  However,  the  disaster  has \nworsened  the  ability  of  major  producers  and  rural  people  to  export \nagricultural  and \nfisheries  products,  access  markets  and  social \nservices,  support  tourism,  and  enjoy  safe  water  supplies.  Negative \nimpacts  on  growth,  poverty,  and  social  indicators  are  expected.  The \ndisaster  also  revealed  the  need  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of \ninfrastructure to climate change and future disasters. \n\n\fPro-poor  economic  growth,  as  well  as  improvements  in  social  and \nhealth  indicators,  depends  on  recovery  of  the  rural  economy.  Better \ntransportation  infrastructure  and  services  are  essential  to  removing \nbarriers  to  market  access,  promoting  rural  production,  strengthening \npublic  capacity  to  deliver  services,  promoting  tourism,  and  reducing \npoverty.  Improved  infrastructure  will  also  be  less  vulnerable  to \nchanging climatic conditions. \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  help  facilitate  the  recovery \nprocess  and  prepare  the  Project  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation. \nADB  has  also  provided  a  disaster  recovery  adviser  to  assist  the \nGovernment  in  managing  the  transition  phase.  The  Government\u2019s \ninitial recovery strategy is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\nidentifies \n\nthe  development  of \n\nfor \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2007\u20132009) \nSolomon Islands \ntransportation \ninfrastructure  and  services  as  one  of  the  two  main  areas  for  ADB \nassistance. Through other projects and technical assistance (TA), ADB \nis  also  addressing  cross-sectoral  infrastructure  issues  and  technical \ncapacity building. Existing and proposed projects will be prioritized and \nsequenced as  appropriate  to  respond  to  the  emergency,  complement \nactivities, and maximize benefits. \n\nAs  a  post-conflict  and  heavily  indebted  country,  Solomon  Islands  is \neligible  for  grant  financing  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF). \nAn  ADF  grant  will \nthe  European \nleverage  cofinancing \nCommission (EC). \n\nfrom \n\nImpact and Outcome  The goal of the Project is to restore economic and social activities and \naccessibility in affected areas to pre-disaster levels. The purpose is to \nassist  the  Government  in  rehabilitating  damaged  infrastructure  and \nmake  it  less  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  natural  hazards.  The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged \nto  restore \naccessibility  in  rural  areas,  allow  a  resumption  of  economic  activities \nand social services, and safeguard public health. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nis  expected \n\nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $9.75 million. \n\nProject Investment \nPlan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nEuropean Commission \n\nGovernment of Solomon Islands \n\n       Total \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n        4.95 \n\n        4.00 \n\n        0.80 \n\n        9.75 \n\n \nPercent \n50.75 \n\n41.03 \n\n8.22 \n\n100.00 \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $4.95  million  from  the  ADF.

The  pre-rehabilitation \nactivities  of  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \ntendering,  and  awarding  of  contracts  will  start  in  August  2007.  Civil \nworks  are  expected  to  begin  in  December  2007,  physical  completion \nby 31 July 2009, and grant closing by 31 December 2009. \n\nProcurement  under  the  Project,  including  for  ADB  and  Government-\nfinanced  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time),  with  the  flexible  interpretation \npermitted for emergency assistance in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004) \nto  ensure  maximum \nexpediency  in  implementing  the  recovery  program.  Major  civil  works \nwill  be  procured  using  international  and  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Minor  civil  works  will  be  procured  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding, \ncommunity  procurement \nprocedures. \n\nshopping,  and \n\nInternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for \n(i) engineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \n(ii) construction supervision, and (iii) project management. The Project \nwill  fund  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n54 person-months of national consulting services. Consulting services \nwill  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the  single  source  selection \nmethod,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n\nThe  Project  will  restore  the  capacity  of  infrastructure  in  the  affected \nprovinces,  using  appropriate  methods  and  standards  to  reduce  future \nvulnerability.  This  will  support  rural  development,  economic  growth, \nand  poverty  reduction  by  facilitating  access  to  markets  and  services, \nexport of agricultural and fisheries products, and allow a resumption of \ntourism.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fSubprojects  will  be  assessed  based  on  their  contribution  to  national \ndevelopment  objectives  and  priorities.

The  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring \nwomen\u2019s  involvement.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  at  the  subproject \nlevel  will  be  gender-disaggregated, \nthe \ndifferential project impacts and risks facing women, (ii) gender-specific \nmeasures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the \ninterests  and  capacities  of  women  to  participate  in  community \ncontracts.  \n\ninto  account  (i) \n\ntaking \n\nThe  project  design  considers  potential  risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement,  rehabilitation  quality,  and  financial  management.  The \nProject will be implemented through an existing ADB-supported project \nmanagement  and  capacity  building  unit  to  continue  strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity.  Environmental  impacts  will  be  monitored \nthrough  construction  supervision  and  mitigated  at  the  rehabilitation \nstage. \n\n(ii)  preparing  and  monitoring  an \n\nADB will provide TA for Strengthening Disaster Recovery Planning and \nCoordination  to  assist  Government  in  (i)  establishing  coordination \ncapability  to  administer  the  current  and  future  recovery  response \noperations; \nintegrated  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  recovery  action  plan,  and  (iii)  providing \nspecialist technical services for design and capacity building to reduce \nvulnerability  to  natural  hazards.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $950,000. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  ADB  TA  funding \nprogram,  which  will  contribute  $800,000.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $150,000. \n\nThe TA will fund 14 person-months of international consulting services \nand  72  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  Consulting \nservices  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  using  the  single  source \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fKe Loma\n\nONTONG JAVA\n(Lord Howe Atoll)\n\nLuaniua\n\nRoncador Reef\n\nC o r a l   S e a\n\nVANUATU\n\n156  00'Eo\n\n6  00'So\n\nTaro\n\nCHOISEUL\nPROVINCE\n\nShortland\n\nPapara\n\nM\n\na\n\nn\n\nn\ni\nn\n\nVella\nMaravar\n\nVaghena\n\nKolombangara\n\ng\n \nS\nt\nr\n\na\n\nit\ns\n\nKia\n\nSANTA ISABEL\n\nNoro\n\nNEW GEORGIA\n\nBuala\n\nDAI\n\nRanongga\n\nGizo\n\nWESTERN\nPROVINCE\n\nRendova\n\nMunda\n\nB\n\nla\n\nn\n\nc\n\nh\ne \n\nC\n\nVangunu\n\nSusubona\n\nMalu'u\n\nSikaiana\n\nh\n\na\n\nn\n\nn\nel\n\nVANGUNU\n\nRussell\n\nSavo\n\nYandina\n\nTulaghi\n\nSepi\n\nI\n\nn\n\nAuki\n\nFlorida\n\nd\n\ne\n\np\n\nMALAITA\n\nOteotea\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ne\n\nn\n\nc\n\ne\n \nS\nt\nr\n\na\n\nit\ns\n\nHONIARA\n\nAola\n\nLiwe\n\nAvu Avu\n\nGUADALCANAL\n\nHauratarata\n\nMARAMASIKE\n\nUlawa\n\nKira Kira\n\nS  o  l  o  m  o  n         S  e  a\n\nSAN CRISTOBAL\n\nBELLONA\n\nTinggoa\n\nRENNELL\n(MUNGAVA)\n\nN\n\n0\n\n20 40 60 80 100\n\n12  00'So\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nTown\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n7\n-\n1\n5\n5\n3\n \nH\nR\n\n156  00'Eo\n\n20  00'No\n\nPhilippine\nSea\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF PALAU\n\n0o\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\nMARSHALL  ISLANDS\n\nPACIFIC  REGION\n\nI\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nr\nn\na\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\na\n\nl\n \n \n\nD\na\nt\ne\n\nl\ni\n\nn\ne\n\nFEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\n\nNAURU\n\nINDONESIA\n\nPAPUA\nNEW GUINEA\n\nSOLOMON\nISLANDS\n\nTUVALU\n\nK     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\n\n6  00'So\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nA U S T R A L I A\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nSAMOA\n\nTONGA\n\nCOOK\nISLANDS\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF THE\nFIJI\nISLANDS\n\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\n166  00'Eo\n\n20  00'No\n\n0o\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nSOLOMON ISLANDS\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROJECT\n\nDuff\n\nReef \n\nLata\n\nNendo\n\nSANTA CRUZ ISLANDS\n\nUtupua\n\nPeou\n\nVanikolo\n\nS  O  U  T  H      P  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\n\nAnuta\n\n12  00'So\nFataka\n\nTikopia\n\n166  00'Eo\n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Solomon Islands for the Emergency Assistance Project.

Islands1 in these two provinces suffered widespread damage \nto housing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities; and several villages were destroyed. \nAn  estimated  20,000  people  of  a  total  population  of  90,000  in  both  provinces  have  been \naffected. About 5,000 people were displaced and 52 people died.  \n\n3. \n Islands  in  the  affected  provinces  suffered  damage  to  housing,  infrastructure,  schools, \nand medical facilities. The disaster has had a negative effect on tourism in the affected areas, \nand  will  impede  growth  of  the  industry  by  worsening  access  to  tourism  centers.  It  has  also \naffected fisheries and agricultural production, and made export of local products more difficult. \n\n4. \nThe force of the earthquake was such that the physical environment of the islands and \nreefs  have  changed,  leaving  a  small  number  of  islands  and  reefs  tilted  and  causing  concern \nabout  the  impact  on  coastal  vulnerability,  ground  water  access  and  levels,  drainage  systems \n(both natural streams and wetlands and constructed drains), agriculture, and livelihoods. \n\n Emergency  humanitarian \n\nrelief  by  development  partners  and  nongovernment \n5. \norganizations  (NGOs)  has  provided \ntemporary  shelter  and  subsistence  needs,  while \ngovernment  and  externally  funded  programs  are  working  to  rebuild  education  and  health \nfacilities and reinstate livelihoods. Recovery and rehabilitation will depend on restoring access \nto affected areas and maintaining public health. However, the disaster has worsened the ability \nof  rural  people  to  access  markets  and  social  services,  and  reduced  access  to  safe  water \nsupplies. Negative impacts on growth, poverty, and social indicators are expected. \n\n6. \n In  recognition  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  long  experience  and \nimplementation of ongoing projects and TA in Solomon Islands, the Government requested ADB \nto  prepare  the  Project  for  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  and  to  assist  with  overall \ncoordination.  To  help  facilitate  the  recovery  process,  ADB  immediately  provided  a  disaster \nrecovery adviser to assist the Government with initial coordination of the relief phase. ADB will \nalso  provide  TA  to  strengthen  coordination,  prepare  an  integrated  and  environmentally \nsustainable  recovery  action  plan,  and  implement  the  Project  through  technical  design  and \nsupervision. \n\nB. \n\nDamage Assessment \n\n7. \nSolomon  Islands  is  a  large  Melanesian  island  country,  with  a  land  area  of  about \n28,000 square  kilometers  (km2),  comprising  six  large  islands,  dozens  of  smaller  islands,  and \nhundreds  of  islets  and  atolls.  More  than  80%  of  the  population  of  475,000  is  rural,  living  in \n\n                                                 \n1  Including  the  islands  of  Choiseul,  Gizo,  Kolombangara,  Mono,  New  Georgia,  Ranongga,  Rendova,  Shortlands, \n\nSimbo, and Vella Lavella.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nwidely dispersed villages of a few hundred persons. The country, especially in rural areas, lacks \nadequate infrastructure and services. The disaster has worsened this situation. \n\n8. \nThe national road network is sparse, reaching only 23% of rural villages with about 20% \nof  the  national  population,  mostly  on  the  islands  of  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita.  Western  and \nChoiseul  provinces  have  relatively  short  coastal  segments  of  gravel  or  earth  roads  near \nprovincial  centers.  The  damaged  condition  of  the  network  in  the  affected  areas  has  further \nreduced rural accessibility, thus restricting the contribution of road transport to economic growth, \npoverty reduction, and social development.   \n\n9. \nDamage  to  land  transport  infrastructure  has  been  extensive.  The  tsunami  has  cut  off \nvillages  from  the  main  centers  on  the  islands.  In  the  worst  affected  areas,  roads  and  coastal \nareas  have  been  heavily  scoured  and  covered  with  debris.  Roadside  drains  and  culverts  are \nblocked or damaged because of seismic and tsunami action. Bridge abutments, which were not \ndesigned for seismic impacts, have been completely destroyed. A few bridges appear to be in \nsatisfactory  condition  but  will  require  investigation  as  the  earthquake  tremors  may  have \ndestabilized their foundations. In total, about 70 kilometers (km) of roads, 48 bridges, 0.7 km of \nseawalls,  and  0.7  km  of  protection  works  were  severely  damaged  or  destroyed.  In  addition, \nminor  damages  have  been  incurred  to  other  roads,  bridges,  and  retaining  walls.  Most  of  the \ndamage has been on the islands of Gizo and Choiseul.  \n\nBecause  of  the  archipelagic  nature  of  the  country,  the  dispersion  of  population,  a \n10. \npredominance of coastal settlements, and the sparse road network, the main form of transport \nin  rural  areas  is  often  by  small  boat  around  coastal  areas  and  by  coastal  ships  between \nprovinces.  However,  earthquake  tremors  have  destabilized  the  substructure  of  many  wharves \nand jetties, and the tsunami has mostly destroyed their superstructures, leaving them unusable. \nSome  wharves  are  completely  destroyed,  while  some  are  repairable.  A  total  of  19  wharves, \n14 jetties,  and  52  causeways  were  damaged  or  destroyed  in  the  areas  affected  by  the \nearthquake and tsunami. In addition, the earthquake raised parts of some islands and lowered \nothers, which has dramatically impaired physical access and rendered some wharves unusable. \n\n11. \nIn  the  main  town  of  Gizo,  the  water  supply  is  operational  but  damaged.  Following  the \ndisaster,  water  flows  have  slowed  and  there  is  significant  supply  loss  from  the  intake  to \nreservoirs and storage tanks. The distribution main from the intake to the storage reservoir was \nbroken in several locations. The water supply is contaminated and unsuitable for drinking. Given \nthe growing population of Gizo, the intake, purification, distribution, and storage systems need \nupgrading to meet the growing demand. Sanitation facilities also require improvement.  \n\nAn  assessment  team  led  by  ADB,  with  participation  from  the  Australian  Agency  for \n12. \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  and \nInternational \nDevelopment  (NZAID),  conducted  a  rapid  damage  assessment  of  transport  infrastructure  and \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  in  the  affected  areas.  Based  on  the  damage  assessments  and  a \nstandardized methodology developed with the World Bank and the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), the cost of damage to transport infrastructure and the water and sanitation \nsector  is  estimated  at  about  $7.2  million.  The  estimated  reconstruction  cost  of  all  damaged \ninfrastructure is about $40 million. The complete assessment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nthe  New  Zealand  Agency \n\nfor \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Impact \n\n13. \nSolomon Islands is a weakly performing country emerging from several years of conflict, \nand is one of the least developed of ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member countries. The economy \nis  based  on  primary  commodities  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing.  Production  of \ncommodities  is  based primarily  in  rural  areas.  During  the  conflict,  real  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  per  capita  declined  by  35%  to  about  $500.  From  2003  to  2005,  GDP  growth  averaged  \n\n\f4\u20135%  per  year,  but  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  Central  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands \nestimate  that  the  growth  rate  will  fall  to  about  3%  for  the  next  few  years.  The  socioeconomic \nsituation  is  characterized  by  high  unemployment  (with  only  about  a  quarter  of  the  population \nformally  employed)  and  rapid  population  growth  of  nearly  3%  per  year.  In  the  United  Nations\u2019 \nHuman  Development  Index,  Solomon  Islands  ranks  second  lowest  among  Pacific  island \ncountries. It is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n\n14. \nThe  affected  area  generates  a  disproportionate  share  of  Solomon  Islands\u2019  national \noutput through forestry, fisheries, and agriculture, and almost all of its tourism. These activities \nare  highly  dependent  on  transport  infrastructure,  particularly  for  exports.  The  effects  of  the \ndisaster thus have national economic implications.   \n\n15. \nIn  addition  to  carrying  export  cargo  and  providing  passenger  services,  roads  and \nwharves  provide  connectivity  to  rural  areas.  As  a  result  of  the  recent  damage  to  transport \ninfrastructure,  many  villages  are  without  access  to  transport.  Communities  are  not  able  to \nmarket  their  produce  or  access  social  services.  These  constraints  will  adversely  affect  rural \neconomic development, poverty reduction, and social services within the two provinces. \n\n16. \nThe  immediate  economic  impacts  of  the  disaster  relate  to  the  (i)  opportunity  costs  to \nboth  the  public  and  private  sectors  to  finance  recovery  that  redirects  funding  from  productive \nassets  to  rehabilitation;  (ii)  lost  revenues  while  private  and  public  services  are  not  functional, \nwith  related  employment  and  socioeconomic  impacts;  and  (iii)  loss  of  tourism,  fisheries,  and \nagricultural production. These losses will decrease productivity and economic growth as long as \nkey facilities are not rehabilitated. Longer-term negative impacts on the national economy would \nbecome serious if production and exports remain restricted by transport problems.  \n\nD. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Response  \n\n17. \nThe  Government  quickly  mobilized  relief  and  rescue  operations  and  took  over  the \nprovincial administration in Gizo, which is the most populous center in the affected areas. The \nGovernment  distributed  emergency  food  relief  while  NGOs  responded  with  provision  of \ntemporary shelter and nonfood relief supplies. \n\n18. \nSolomon Islands\u2019 overall disaster response is guided by a National Disaster Plan (NDP) \nauthorized under legislation. The NDP facilitates the effective utilization of existing government \nstructures,  complemented  by  a  system  to  mobilize  the  response  of  other  stakeholders.  The \nNational Disaster Council (NDC) headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs has been activated as \nthe oversight authority. The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), under NDC, acts as \nsecretariat  and  coordinates  assistance.  Disaster  committees  chaired  by  provincial  secretaries \nimplement the NDP at provincial level. However, in the case of Western Province, the disaster\u2019s \nimpact rendered the provincial government inoperative. With assistance from ADB and UNDP, a \nmechanism  has  been  created  to  improve  coordination  between  levels  of  government.  The \nGovernment also convenes regular meetings of development partners and NGOs. \n\n19. \nAn initial damage assessment was undertaken by NDMO, and refined by line ministries. \nA technical advisory team (TAT) comprising all relevant ministries has been established and is \nled by the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination with assistance from UNDP \nand ADB to identify needs and issues arising from the disaster, and prepare a recovery action \nplan  (RAP).  Given  the  extent  of  damage  and  remoteness  of  affected  areas,  the  emergency \nphase  has  extended  beyond  a  month.  As  the  transition  to  recovery  gathers  pace,  NDMO  and \nTAT  are  collaborating  to  ensure  relief  and  recovery  activities  continue  effectively.  The \nGovernment\u2019s initial recovery strategy is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  vision,  priorities,  and  strategies  are  articulated  in  the \n20. \nNational  Economic  Recovery,  Reform,  and  Development  Plan  (NERRDP).2  This  identifies  key \nstrategic  areas  for  revitalizing  the  productive  sector  and  rebuilding  infrastructure,  and  for \nrestoring basic social services and fostering social development. The NERRDP recognizes the \nimportance  of  transport  infrastructure  as  an  enabling  input  for  community  development.  The \nNational  Transport  Plan3  (NTP)  provides  the  framework  and  action  plan  for  developing  and \nmaintaining  physical  infrastructure,  facilitating  transport  services,  improving  the  capacity  of \ngovernment agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. An official transport task force \n(TTF)  including  representatives  of  the  Government,  transport  users,  and  transport  service \nproviders advises the Government on key issues, development options, and priorities.  \n\n21. \nThe RAP is the Government\u2019s reconstruction and rehabilitation program for the medium \nand longer term. It includes the overall damage and loss assessments, prioritized actions and \ninvestments, a plan to monitor program implementation and report progress to NDC, and a plan \nfor  donor  coordination.  The  RAP  has  been  developed  consistently  with  the  NDP,  NTP,  and \nNERDDP.  The  RAP  has  been  reviewed  by  ADB,  endorsed  by  the  TAT  and  NDC,  and  will  be \napproved  by  the  Government  to  officially  guide  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  program. \nThe RAP serves as the sector development plan to guide project implementation to ensure that \nactivities are complementary and sequenced in accordance with recovery priorities. \n\nE. \n\nDevelopment Partners\u2019 Response \n\n22. \nGovernment,  development  partners,  NGOs,  and  the  private  sector  provided  immediate \nassistance  in  response  to  the  disaster.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fThe  United  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  and  Coordination  Team  (UNDAC)  mobilized \n23. \nthree  days  after  the  disaster  to  assist  NDC  in  coordinating  the  response  to  the  emergency, \nfollowed  by  a  joint  UNDAC/NDC  team  which  arrived  two  days  later  with  a  team  in  Gizo  to \nsupport  the  Provincial  Disaster  Council  and  coordinate  the  relief  effort.  NDMO  has  also  been \nsupported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). \nEarly in the emergency phase, cluster working groups on shelter, health, water and sanitation, \nnon-food item distribution, and child protection were facilitated by UNDAC. \n\n24. \nUNDP is continuing to assist the Government, through the NDC-NDMO-TAT structure, in \nthe  recovery  phase  to  (i)  augment  on-going  emergency  assistance  operations  through \nmeasures that foster the self-reliance of the affected population and help rebuild livelihoods, (ii) \npromote spontaneous recovery initiatives by the affected population and mitigate the rebuilding \nof risk, and (iii) establish the foundations for longer-term recovery.  \n\n25. \nSeveral development partners are planning to provide assistance in the affected areas. \nAlthough details of sites and activities are not yet available, civil works could be included. The \nProject  will  coordinate  civil  works  with  all  partners  to  complement  activities  and  avoid \nduplication.  ADB  will  also  provide  TA  for  coordination,  to  assist  government  and  development \npartners in finalizing assistance through a process of consultation and joint review. \n\nF. \n\nADB\u2019s Proposed Response \n\n26. \nTo provide immediate disaster response, ADB dispatched staff to support infrastructure \nassessments, communications, programming, and donor coordination. Staff visited the affected \nareas,  supported  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  in  carrying  out  initial \ninfrastructure damage and needs assessment, and provided strategic advice to the Ministry of \nDevelopment  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination  in  defining  and  establishing  the  process  toward \nrecovery and rehabilitation. The team engaged with the Government to determine the role ADB \ncould play in the recovery and rehabilitation phases. \n\nThe Government has requested ADB, on the basis of a Cabinet decision, to coordinate \n27. \nthe  overall  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  process.  Staff  specialized  in  disaster  risk \nmanagement  have  been  fielded  to  assist  Government  in  the  management  of  the  transition \nphase and planning toward recovery. In addition, ADB has agreed to assist the Government in \nthe reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure damage. This effort will be closely aligned \nwith ongoing ADB-supported infrastructure projects in Solomon Islands.  \n\n28. \nTo  support  recovery  and  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  areas,  a  three-part  approach  is \nproposed. First, ADB will continue to provide technical support to assist in the coordination and \ndrafting  of  a  comprehensive  damage  assessment  and  rehabilitation  plan.  Second,  ADB  will \nprioritize and sequence activities within existing projects to respond to urgent needs. Third, the \nproposed  Project  has  been  processed  and  will  be  implemented  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy (2004) to restore essential infrastructure as efficiently as possible. \nADB  is  implementing  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project,4  which  is \n29. \nnearly  complete,  and  the  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement  Project5  (SIRIP),  which  is  just \nbeginning. Both are implemented through project management units under the direction of MID \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2000.

To  avoid  duplication  the  Project  will  be \nimplemented through the SIRIP project management and capacity building unit (PMCBU). \n\n30. \nInfrastructure investments are needed to support economic growth, employment, poverty \nreduction,  and  social  development.  ADB\u2019s  current  country  strategy  and  program  update  for \nSolomon  Islands6  prioritizes  two  major  areas  for  ADB  assistance:  transportation  infrastructure \nand  services,  and  an  enabling  business  environment.  It  also  identifies  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment as central to all activities. These three themes are complementary. \n\nG. \n\nLessons Learned in Disaster Management  \n\n31. \nUnlike  most  other  countries  that  have  recently  experienced  natural  disasters,  the \nrebuilding situation in Solomon Islands is far more sensitive given the post-conflict environment. \nThere are four major challenges and lessons, drawn from other recent natural disasters in the \nAsia  Pacific  region,  and  implementation  of  previous  ADB  emergency  projects  in  Solomon \nIslands, which have guided the design of ADB support.   \n\nFirst,  extensive  but  diverse  forms  of  support,  especially  from  NGOs,  mean  that \n32. \ncoordination  is  vital.  The  Government  needs  to  outline  principles  and  practices  to  guide  the \nsupport from the private sector, NGOs and public-private partnerships, and it ought to effectively \ncoordinate  among  different  donors.  ADB  will  support  these  activities  but  given  the  likely  lead \ntime  involved  in  finalizing  a  medium-term  programmatic  framework  and  the  complexities  in \nchanneling  fund  flows  effectively  to  finance  its  components,  a  hybrid  approach  of  supporting \nproject and sector-based modalities will be adopted. Integrated and multisectoral programming \nis needed to significantly facilitate planning and implementation. Needs assessment should be \ndone jointly by development partners active in the country, with responsibility for implementation \ndivided by sector. Coordination groups should be kept manageable with a regular forum where \npartners  can  interact  with  Government  on  policy  issues  and  project  design.  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners have agreed to work through the TAT for these purposes. \n\nSecond,  dealing  with  a  natural  disaster  in  a  post-conflict  environment  calls  for  a  well-\n33. \nrounded  approach  to  rebuilding  with  participatory  mechanisms  and  equitable  distribution  of \nresources  across  affected  areas  in  a  transparent  and  accountable  manner.  Allocation  of \nresources to different areas needs to be in line with assessed damages and losses. A conflict-\nsensitive  approach  is  more  likely  to  improve  prospects  of  genuine  improvement  through \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  Phasing  of  response/recovery  should  follow  where  possible \nthe expressed needs of the affected population. Careful poverty targeting and sensitive project \ndesign can lead to major poverty reduction impacts even under difficult circumstances. \n\n34. \nThird,  the  rebuilding  process  will  take  place  in  an  environment  with  depleted  public \nadministration systems, yet one that is decentralized down to the district level. Even in normal \ncircumstances,  local  government  capacity  has  generally  been  weak.  Now,  the  disaster  has \nfurther  weakened  the  capacity  in  the  affected  provinces.  It  is  vital  that  the  provinces  are \nrespected and credibility and trust are built up among the affected local officials and the citizens. \nWeak local capacity requires support of the national Government in the first phase to facilitate \nand  develop  local  capacities  for  implementation  programs,  including  through  NGOs,  while  not \nundermining the responsibilities of provincial and local governments. ADB will continue to work \nwith  UNDP  to  support  capacity  of  local  governments  that  are  being  revived  and  establish \nworking groups parallel to the ones at the central level.  \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132007): Solomon Islands. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fFourth, geological changes in many areas may have caused shifts in the demographic \n35. \nand  social  composition  of  communities.  In  the  mainly  coastal  communities,  the  rebuilding \nprocess  will  not  be  initiated  until  spatial  plans  are  finalized.  The  Government  has  proposed \nrezoning of some coastal areas and resettlement of coastal communities. In the most affected \ncoastal zones, rebuilding infrastructure and public facilities will be based on the environmental \nassessment process and consultations with the affected communities. If families have to move \nfrom  their  customary  land,  resolution  of  land  allocation  may  prove  to  be  one  of  the  most \ncomplex  and  time-consuming  issues.  A  serious  challenge  is  to  develop  participatory \nmechanisms  to  truly  enable  the  people  to  determine  issues  such  as  those  related  to  spatial \nlocation. A consistent policy framework needs to be adopted on land titling and spatial planning \nthat takes into account the likelihood of sea level rise and future natural disasters. Consultation \nand participatory processes will be addressed under TA as described in Appendix 7. \n\nH. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n36. \nPro-poor  economic  growth  and  improvement  in  social and  health  indicators  depend  on \nthe revitalization and decentralization of the rural economy, made more urgent by the disaster. \nThe damaged condition of the transport network is a constraint to the movement of people and \ngoods, a disincentive to productive rural activity, and an impediment to the recovery and growth \nof  tourism.  Improved  transportation  infrastructure  and  services,  which would  restore  access  to \ndomestic  and  international  markets  for  agricultural  and  fisheries  products,  are  critical  to \nrestarting  and  rebuilding  rural  economies  in  the  affected  areas.  The  focus  on  restoring  rural \naccessibility will therefore enhance poverty reduction. \n\n37. \nPrior to the disaster, deteriorating rural infrastructure and lack of access to rural services \nand markets hampered rural production and constrained the development of tourism. Damage \nto the transport network has exacerbated the situation. Economic restoration and employment \ngrowth,  therefore,  is  severely  constrained.  A  rehabilitated  and  sustainable  rural  transport \nnetwork can enhance rural economic development significantly by restoring access, which will \nraise rural incomes and stimulate production and employment. \n\n38. \nThe disaster is also evidence of the Solomon Islands\u2019 increased vulnerability to changes \nin climatic conditions. Climate change is expected to increase extreme weather events, and to \ncause sea level to rise. Roads, bridges, and wharves require improved environmental protection \nand higher construction standards to withstand potential future natural events. The Project will \nbe designed to withstand a projected increased likelihood of such effects within the expected life \nof  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  While  design  criteria  for  climate  change  adaptation  are  not \navailable for the Solomon Islands the methodology to incorporate climate proofing within design is \ndetailed in an ADB publication.7 \n\n39. \nCommunities  have  a  clear  interest  in  a  good  transport  network,  which  creates  an \nopportunity to involve them actively in rehabilitation and maintenance. Contracting maintenance \nthrough  community  participation  and  labor-based  methods  will  generate  income  for  the  rural \npopulation. Consultations allow them to determine how they will contribute, and on what terms \n(e.g.,  by  contributing  labor  or  local  materials).  A  participatory  approach  to  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance  allows  the  capacities  and  contributions  of  communities,  including  the  large \nnumbers  of  unemployed,  to  be  utilized  proactively.  A  gender-aware  approach  to  community \nliaison and consultations can ensure that the perspectives and capabilities of women are taken \ninto account, and that an appropriate participation strategy is devised.  \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe  Project  and  TA  have  incorporated  the  lessons  described  above  by  emphasizing \n40. \nimproved designs to reduce vulnerability, enhancing coordination, and providing for community \nparticipation. The Project will preserve the gains being made under ADB\u2019s strategy for Solomon \nIslands  by  (i)  restoring  transportation  infrastructure,  (ii)  facilitating  expanded  transportation \nservices,  and  (iii)  providing  opportunities  for  direct  private  sector  and  community  participation. \nFurther, TA attached to the Project will guide external assistance through better aid coordination \nand consistent development planning. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT   \n\nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  restore  economic  and  social  activities  and  accessibility  in \n41. \naffected areas to pre-disaster levels. The purpose is to assist the Government in rehabilitating \ndamaged infrastructure and make it less vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The \nrehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is expected to restore accessibility in rural areas, allow \na  resumption  of  economic  activities  and  social  services,  and  safeguard  public  health.  The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  via  a  sector  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be \n42. \nprioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria in Appendix 3.  A \nsystematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject  appraisal,  covering  (i) \nsocial,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation; \n(iv) \nimplementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in accordance with the detail and \nquality  required  to  enable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the  subproject. \nImplementation  will  incorporate  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  and  general  health  and \nsafety activities, as appropriate.  \n\n(iii)  procurement; \n\n(ii)  design; \n\n43. \nComponent A: Road Rehabilitation. The Project will finance rehabilitation of damaged \nland transport infrastructure. This will include repair of about 35 km of unsealed roads and about \n35  watercourse  crossings  (culverts  and  wet  crossings),  and  replacement  of  about  19  bridges. \nThe  proposed  bridge  structures  will  be  designed  and  constructed  in  accordance  with  seismic \nstandards  to  withstand  earthquakes  of  similar  or  larger  magnitude.  Designs  will  incorporate \nlateral  movement  of  the  structure  compatible  with  earthquake  and  tsunami  forces.  Similarly, \nprotection works and sea walls will be also be designed and constructed to withstand tsunami or \ncyclone-generated forces. \n\n44. \nComponent B: Wharf and Jetty Rehabilitation. The Project will finance rehabilitation \nof damaged water transport infrastructure. This will include reconstruction of about five wharves \nand jetties. The proposed wharves and jetties will be designed and constructed in accordance \nwith  seismic  standards  to  withstand  against  an  earthquake  of  similar  or  larger  magnitude. \nDesigns  will  incorporate  lateral  movement  of  the  structure  compatible  with  earthquake  and \ntsunami  forces.  Wharves  and  jetties  will  be  constructed  and  protected  to  withstand  against \ntsunami or cyclone-generated forces. \n\n45. \nComponent  C:  Gizo  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Rehabilitation.  The  Project  will \nfinance rehabilitation of the Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. This will include (i) \nrepairs to the distribution main and restoring flows to pre-disaster level; (ii) cleaning, repairs and \nimprovements  to  intake  and  reservoirs;  (iii)  upgrade  existing  water  supply  systems  with  more \nreliable source development; (iv) shipment and installation of storage tanks; (v) procurement of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\felectrical  components  and  cables  of  the  submersible  pump;  (vi)  installation  of  a  purification \nsystem for safe drinking water; and (vii) repairs to the sanitation system. \n\n46. \nComponent D: Maintenance via Community Participation. During implementation the \nProject will finance minor routine maintenance on rehabilitated infrastructure through community \nparticipation  and  labor-based  methods.  Small  specialized  maintenance  equipment  will  be \nprocured  for  future  sustainability  of  labor-based  methods  and  ongoing  road  maintenance \ncontracts by the community. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Feature \n\n47. \nADB,  AusAID,  NZAID,  and  the  European  Commission  prepared  the  Project  through  a \njoint mission to draw on their existing partnerships in the Solomon Islands transport sector. This \ncollaboration has ensured incorporation of the experience, perspectives, and lessons learned by \nthe Government and its development partners.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  require  an  investment  of  $9.75  million.

The Government of Solomon Islands will provide $0.80 million \nin counterpart contributions. The EC will provide grant cofinancing of $4 million equivalent, to be \nadministered  by  ADB,  for  the  road  rehabilitation  component.  ADB  and  the  Government  will \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nfinance  the  remaining  components  and  related  costs.  The  detailed  financing  plan  is  in \nAppendix 2, and is summarized in Table 3.  \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n4.95 \n4.00 \n0.80 \n9.75 \n\nPercent \n50.75 \n41.03 \n8.22 \n100.00 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nEuropean Commission \nGovernment of Solomon Islands \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nF. \n\nCofinancing \n\n50. \nAn  underlying  objective  of  ADB's  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  is  to \ncoordinate  with  development  partners,  minimize  duplication,  encourage  cofinancing,  and \ncatalyze the provision of additional resources. It is likely that a number of these partners may be \nwilling  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  funds  for  this  Project  through  cofinancing.  ADB  has  typically \nsought  approval  from  its  Board  of  Directors  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant  funds  from \ncofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  In  light  of  the  need  for \nexpediency  and  efficiency  in  ADB's  response  to  the  disaster,  Management  requests  Board \napproval  of  the  administration  of  any  cofinanced  funds  obtained  from  development  partners \nsubsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of such cofinanced funds will be confirmed \nand  approved  by  Management,  and  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  standard \nprocedures. This procedure will be adopted only to the extent that the additional funds provided \nby  cofinanciers  will  not  materially  alter  or  fundamentally  affect  the  objectives,  purposes,  and \nscope  of  the  Project.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  will  materially  affect  the  objectives, \npurpose, or scope of the Project would be processed as a major change of scope and circulated \nto  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  usual  procedures  under  ADB's  Project  Administration \nInstructions, section 5.04. \n\n51. \nAs described above, the EC has committed to provide joint cofinancing in the amount of \n$4 million equivalent, allowing ADB to catalyze additional resources for the Project. For the EC \nto  participate,  it  requires  nondiscrimination  in  procurement  processes  against  legal  persons, \nfirms,  and  goods  established  in  EC-recognized  official  candidate  countries,  member  states  of \nthe  European  Economic  Area,  and  developing  countries  as  specified  in  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee rules.8 \nManagement  requests  Board  approval  to  allow  procurement  in,  and  procurement  of  eligible \ngoods and services from, the above mentioned entities. \n\nThe  request  for  Board  approval  is  being  made  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the  ADB \n52. \nCharter,  which  states  that  the  Board  may,  by  vote  of  the  Directors  representing  not  less  than \ntwo  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  approve  procurement  from  ADB \nnonmember  countries  in  appropriate  circumstances.9  The  EC  cofinancing  of  $4  million \n\n                                                 \n8 Regulation (EC) No. 2110/2005 of the European Council and Parliament, 14 December 2005. \n9 The Charter provides one, nonexclusive example of  what  may constitute \"appropriate circumstances\"  for allowing \nprocurement in non-ADB member countries or procurement of goods and services produced in ADB nonmember \ncountries. It states that the Charter's requirement that procurement occur only in member countries may be lifted \n\"in the case of a nonmember country in  which a significant amount of financing has been provided to the Bank\". \nThis example is similar to the current proposal. \n\n \n\n\fequivalent  will  finance  the  road  rehabilitation  component.  The  Board\u2019s  approval  for  lifting  the \nprocurement restriction is requested only in support of this component of the Project. \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  will  be  MID.  The  Government\u2019s  TTF10  will \n53. \nserve  as  the  project  steering  committee,  overseeing  and  monitoring  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation,  including  (i)  policy  guidance  and  coordination,  (ii)  subproject  feasibility  study \nand  selection,  (iii)  project  progress  reports  and  other  project  documentation,  and  (iv)  audited \naccounts and financial statements. \n\nThe  existing  PMCBU  for  SIRIP,  directed  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  MID,  will  be \n54. \nresponsible for implementation. The PMCBU will (i) conduct subproject feasibility assessments, \ndesign,  and  supervision;  (ii)  manage  tendering  processes;  (iii)  manage  contracts;  (iv)  prepare \nwithdrawal  applications;  (v)  prepare  project  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report; \n(vi)  maintain  project  accounts  for  auditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  and \nenvironmental impacts; and (viii) complete related project management activities, as necessary \nto implement the Project successfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines.  \n\n55. \nAlthough  the  PMCBU  is  fully  integrated  with  MID  professional  and  technical  staff  as \ncounterparts,  the  volume  and  schedule  of  existing  activities  under  SIRIP  and  MID\u2019s  limited \ntechnical  staff  resources  mean  that  the  PMCBU  needs  to  be  supplemented  with  additional \ntechnical support for these services as described below and in Appendix 7. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n56. \nThe Project will be implemented over 2 years. Recruitment of the PMCBU consultants, \ninitiated  under  advance  procurement,  will  be  completed  by  July  2007.  Other  preparatory \nactivities  for  initial  works  will  be  completed  by  December  2007,  including  feasibility  studies, \ndetailed  design,  tender  documentation,  award  of  contract,  and  mobilization.  Rehabilitation \nactivities  will  be  physically  completed  by  30  June  2009.  The  grant  is  scheduled  to  close  by \n31 December 2009. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 4.   \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n57. \nProcurement  under  the  Project,  including  packages  financed  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nCivil works will be divided into packages to be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB), national competitive bidding (NCB), shopping, or community procurement procedures as \nappropriate.  A  number  of  packages  for  maintenance  contracts,  to  be  determined  during \nimplementation,  will  also  be  procured  using  NCB,  shopping,  or  community  procurement \nprocedures.  Before  the  commencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  NCB,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will review the Government\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications \nthe \nGovernment's procedures will be documented in the procurement plan. Technical and financial \nqualifications of contractors will be reviewed in conjunction with the review of the bid proposals. \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n10  The  TTF  is  chaired  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  the  Department  of  Planning  and  includes  the  permanent \nsecretaries  of  the  departments  of  infrastructure  and  development,  provincial  development,  and  finance  and \ntreasury as members. The MID Transport Policy and Planning Unit acts as the TTF secretariat. AusAID and NZAID \nare also members by invitation of the Government in recognition of their key role. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nContractors  might  be  awarded  more  than  one  contract  package  based  on  the  least-cost \ncombination  of  contracts.  Evaluation  of  ICB  contracts  will  include  a  margin  of  preference  for \ndomestic contractors as specified in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in \nAppendix 5. \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n58. \nGiven  the  urgency  of  the  recovery  activities,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  the \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  recruitment  of  consultants  by  direct  selection.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance any part of the recovery program.  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n59. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  supplement  the  PMCBU,  which  will  handle \n(i) engineering design and preparation of bidding documents, (ii) construction supervision, and \n(iii) project management. The Project will fund approximately 18 person-months of international \nconsulting  services  and  54  person-months  of  national  consulting  services,  provided  by  a  firm. \nConsultants  will  be  supervised  by  the  current  PMCBU  project  manager.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 6.  \n\nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n60. \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). At the request of the Government, ADB will \nrecruit  the  PMCBU  consultants.  Given  the  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  the  critical \nrequirement  to  ensure  continuation  and  integrate  activities  with  ongoing  projects,  and  the \nsatisfactory  performance  of  the  existing  firm,  engagement  of  consultants  through  a  firm  using \nADB\u2019s single source selection method is justified.   \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n61. \nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct \npayments and reimbursements. The PMCBU will open and maintain dedicated imprest accounts \nfor each funding source in a domestic bank. The maximum amount in each account will be 10% \nof  the  eligible  funding  from  each  source,  or  the  equivalent  of  6  months  of  expenditures  from \neach source, whichever is lower. The initial amount deposited in each imprest account will not \nexceed $250,000 equivalent. Withdrawals from the grant accounts will be made on the basis of \n100% of eligible expenditures for each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by \nthe grant. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursement of \neligible expenditures and liquidation of imprest account expenses, and is applicable to individual \npayments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000,  upon  review  and  approval  by  ADB. \nPayments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed based on the normal process with full \nsupporting  documentation.  Direct  payments  will  be  encouraged  for  most  civil  works  and \nconsulting services. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n62. \nReports. MID will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on preconstruction activities \nand  construction  of  civil  works,  including  (i)  physical  and  financial  progress,  (ii)  status  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),11  (iii)  environmental  management,  (iv)  public \n                                                 \n11 Since all work will involve rehabilitation of existing facilities within existing rights-of-way, neither land acquisition nor \n\nresettlement is expected to be necessary. \n\n \n\n\fcommunication campaigns, and (v) other activities critical to project implementation. To facilitate \nperformance monitoring and post-project review, the Government has agreed to provide ADB, \nwithin  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  completion  report  that  will  cover \nimplementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that ADB might require.  \n\nAccounts and Audits. MID will maintain separate records and accounts that will identify \n63. \nthe goods and services financed from the grant, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and \nthe  use  of  counterpart  funds.  The  project  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  practices  that  will  follow  internationally \naccepted accounting standards. External auditors acceptable to ADB may be used to audit the \naccounts  and  annual  financial  statements  annually.  The  audit  reports  will  include  an  auditor\u2019s \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  grant  proceeds,  compliance  with  the  financial covenants  included  in \nthe grant and project agreements, the use of the SOE procedure, and use of imprest accounts. \nThe Government will provide ADB with the annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts,  audit  reports,  management  letters,  and  other  related  statements  no  later  than \n6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n64. \n MID will establish a project performance and monitoring system within 3 months of grant \neffectiveness.  ADB  and  the  Government,  in  consultation  with  the  Project\u2019s  development \npartners, will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project performance in \nachieving its goals and purposes. These indicators will be refined and monitored during project \nimplementation.  The  indicators  will  include  data  for  monitoring  economic  development,  social \ndevelopment,  environmental  impacts,  and  maintenance.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nbased on gender-disaggregated data for social and poverty impact indicators. MID will monitor \nand evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide a final report within 6 months of the \nend  of  the  contract  period.  Guidelines  for  baseline  values  for  subprojects,  data  collection  and \nanalysis, and periods for future monitoring are in Appendix 10.  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n65. \nADB, together with the EC and the Government, will undertake regular review missions \napproximately every 6 months. Reviews will evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, \nand  other  relevant  aspects  of  the  Project  (including  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  and  financial  aspects)  that \nmight affect project performance, viability, and achievement of scheduled targets. \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n66. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  ADB-financed \ncontracts  for  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n67. \nThe  disaster  has  revealed  a  need  to  improve  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \nemergency  response,  improve  infrastructure  analysis  and  planning,  and  develop  an  effective \nto  climate  change.  TA  can  strengthen  disaster \nframework \nmanagement,  infrastructure  planning,  and  mitigation  capacity  to  ensure  that  (i)  future \ninfrastructure  designs  incorporate  adaptation,  and  (ii)  mitigation  strategies  and  are  less \nvulnerable to climate change and potential future disasters. \n\nfor  mitigating  vulnerability \n\nThe TA will (i) strengthen disaster and emergency management; (ii) analyze, plan, and \n68. \nmonitor infrastructure rehabilitation in the affected areas; and (iii) design and build capacity for \npreparation of environmentally sustainable infrastructure subprojects that reduce vulnerability to \nclimate  change  and  natural  hazards  in  the  recommendations  for  future  development.  The  TA \nwill also help the Government establish an effective response capability by coordinating across \nrelevant  ministries  to  administer  current  and  future  recovery  response  operations.  To  improve \nplanning,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  adopt  a  systematic  approach  to  mitigating  the \ncountry\u2019s  vulnerability  to  adverse  weather  conditions  through  design  of  environmentally \nsustainable infrastructure. Although some TA activities are related to project implementation, a \nflexible approach to the use of TA is justified to leverage ADF resources and build capacity for \nimplementation of an emergency response in a weakly performing country. \n\n ADB will provide TA for Strengthening Capacity Building for Disaster Recovery Planning \n69. \nand Coordination. The total cost of the TA is $950,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the ADB TA funding program, which will contribute $800,000. The Government will contribute \n$150,000 equivalent in counterpart contributions through the provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace and administrative support, and logistics and local transport. ADB will engage consulting \nservices for the TA as specified in Appendix 7 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants for the selection and engagement of international and national consultants.  \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n70. \nThe Project will directly benefit the rural population in affected areas, many of whom are \npoor or extremely poor, by restoring access to economic opportunities and social services and \nsafeguarding  public  health.  Government  agencies  and  private  sector  companies  that  use  the \ntransport network to deliver products and services will benefit similarly. The estimated benefits \nto these groups, as well as other impacts, assumptions, and risks, are based on overall project \nanalysis and on the sample subproject documented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n71. \nRehabilitation  of  roads  and  bridges,  wharves,  and  water  supplies  is  essential  to \nrestoration  of  economic  activities\u2014including  agricultural  exports  from  the  affected  areas  and \naccess  for  tourism\u2014and  will  thus  improve  the  prospects  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  In  the  affected  areas,  efficient  and  effective  transport  infrastructure  is  essential  for \naccess to economic opportunities and social services by rural people who are disproportionately \npoor  and  disadvantaged.  Damage  to  the  transport  network  is  restricting  the  delivery  of  food, \nfuel, and building materials necessary for recovery. The rehabilitation program will mitigate the \npotentially  extended  negative  impacts  of  the  disaster  and  enable  the  country  to  recover  with \nonly a temporary setback.  \n\nProject  activities  will  be  technically  sound,  cost-effective,  and  represent  a  least-cost \n72. \nalternative  with  appropriate  adjustment  for  climate-resistant  design.  Economic  evaluations  of \nsubprojects  will  be  carried  out  using  methods  appropriate  to  the  context,  including  economic \n\n\finternal rates of return and sensitivity analyses. The evaluations will be required to demonstrate \nthat subprojects are economically justifiable and will be used to prioritize individual subprojects. \nThe economic criteria are in Appendix 3.  \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact  \n\n73. \nThe  Project  will  restore  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  by  reinstating  people\u2019s \naccess to local and provincial markets for agricultural and fisheries products, thereby restoring \nincome  generation  opportunities.  The  Project  also  will  reduce  poverty  by  offering  direct \nemployment on the Project. During implementation, employment will be created in construction \nand  maintenance  for  civil  works.  Following  completion,  employment  opportunities  will  arise  for \nroutine maintenance conducted through community contracts.  \n\nDuring the poverty and social analysis of  the subprojects, the economic impacts of the \n74. \nProject on the poor and nonpoor will be assessed using secondary and field data. Distributional \nanalysis  will  not  be  needed  unless  the  initial  assessment  is  considered  insufficient,  and  if  the \nextra data collection and analysis required for distributional analysis is considered worthwhile. A \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  8.  A  social  and  poverty  impact \nanalysis of the sample subproject is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n75. \nThe Project will restore access to social services and safe water for Gizo town residents. \nPositive  social  impacts  include  restoration  of  access  to  education  facilities,  which  will  help \nmaintain  school  enrolment  and  retention  rates,  and  restoration  of  access  to  health  services, \nwhich  will  promote  more  frequent  use  and  facilitate  rapid  care  during  medical  emergencies. \nOther  social  benefits  include  restoration  of  access  to  administrative  and  service  centers, \nincluding communication facilities. \n\nAs  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  subprojects,  consultations  will  be \n76. \nundertaken  in  each  subproject  location  with  (i)  resource  owners,  (ii)  households,  (iii)  the  poor \nand nonpoor, (iv) females and males, (v) young and old, (vi) the disabled, (vii) community-based \norganizations and NGOs, (viii) transport service providers and users, (ix) local contractors, and \n(x)  provincial  and  district  governments.  The  TTF  is  expected  to  establish  local  consultative \ngroups that will be the primary contact point between the Project and communities on project-\nrelated matters, including recruitment of labor and access to aggregates. \n\n77. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  at  the  subproject  level  will  be  gender-disaggregated  to \ndetermine  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks  facing  women,  (ii)  gender-specific \nmeasures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and (iii) the interests and capacities of \nwomen  to  contribute  to  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  be \nproactive in ensuring the involvement of women.  \n\n78.  While  the  reported  number  of  HIV/AIDS  infections  remains  low  across  the  country, \nSolomon  Islands  is  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS.  Appropriate  education  and  prevention  will  be \nintegrated  to  the  Project.  Construction  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  their  crews  and \ncommunities access to education and control programs.  \n\n79. \nThe  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require  resettlement  or  land \nacquisition,  as  all  works  are  expected  to  be  undertaken  on  existing  facilities  within  existing \nrights-of-way. If changes in conditions require land acquisition or resettlement for civil works, the \nGovernment  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  relevant  laws  and \nregulations, the resettlement framework in Appendix 11, and ADB guidelines. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nNative  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the  population,  are  the \n80. \nindigenous  people  of  Solomon  Islands.  For  the  indigenous  population,  the  rehabilitation \nsubprojects will improve access to health, education, livelihood, and social services. The Project \nis not expected to have a differential impact on indigenous peoples.  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n81. \nThe  Project  is  classified  environmental  category  B,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.12  Field  surveys  of \nsample  subprojects  were  conducted  to  help  assess  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project.  All \nactivities  are  expected  to  be  confined  to  existing  locations  and  rights-of-way,  and  neither  land \nacquisition  nor  resettlement  should  be  required.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nincorporating  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  has  been  prepared \nand is in Supplementary Appendix C. A summary IEE (SIEE) is in Appendix 9. Environmental \nAssessment  and  Review  Procedures  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  ADB\u2019s  assessment \nprocedure  is  aligned  with  the  environmental  impact  assessment  requirements  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s Environment Act, 1998. \n\n82. \nThe Project will be designed to withstand the increased likelihood of future disasters and \nnatural  hazards.  The  environmental  impact  of  the  disaster  has  altered  the  coastline  and \nchanged  surface  and  undersea  conditions  in  some  areas.  Some  zones  near  former  wharves, \njetties, and sea walls may be more vulnerable to erosion, wave removal of sand, and projected \nsea level rises. The design process will include analysis of alternatives for construction that will \nbe reviewed for potential environmental impacts and enhanced environmental sustainability. \n\nSubproject  environmental  selection  criteria  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not \n83. \npermanently  harm  any  ecologically  or  culturally  sensitive  areas  and  that  all  negative  impacts \nidentified will be avoided or mitigated through the design. The construction of improved drainage \nstructures,  stabilization  of  slopes  through  bioengineering,  and  other  measures  undertaken  by \nthe Project will have long-term beneficial impacts on the environment. Short-term impacts will be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts \nsuch as loss of vegetation due to earth moving; and minor sedimentation of waterways and the \ncoastal environment near the shore. These impacts will be addressed, and methods specified in \nthe EMMP will mitigate them.  \n\n84. \nEach  subproject  will  be  subject  to  an  IEE,  which  will  include  a  detailed,  site-specific \nEMMP  prepared  under  the  responsibility  of  the  PMCBU.  The  EMMP  will  specify  the  required \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  Environmental \nassessment  review  procedures  (EARP)  have  been  prepared  that  will  guide  the  environmental \nmanagement  of  the  sector  project  and  preparation  of  environmental  assessment  of  the \nsubsequent subprojects. \n\nE. \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation  \n\n85. \n\nThe risks and mitigation related to the Project include:  \n\n(i) \n\nTechnical  risks.  Weak  capacity  within  the  EA  could  lead  to  implementation \nproblems.  Underestimation  of  resource  allocation  and  improper  construction \nmethods  and  equipment  might  cause  delays  and  increase  costs.  Limited \navailability  of  aggregates  in  some  areas  could  pose  difficulties.  The  project \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndesign will mitigate these risks by (a) managing the Project through the existing \nPMCBU,  which  has  demonstrated  satisfactory  performance,  (b)  incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance by \ncontractors  in  similar  conditions;  (c)  requiring  a  minimum  level  for  provision  of \nphysical  plant  at  mobilization,  detailed  quantification  of  engineering  risks,  and \nadequate  contingencies  for  unforeseen  items;  and  (d)  holding  community \nconsultations in advance, with government support, on subproject selection and \naccess to resources.  \n\nFinancial  risks.  Grant-financed  budgetary  allocations  for  the  Project  could  be \ninadequate  as  a  result  of  underestimated  construction  costs,  more-than-routine \nsupervision of contractors, inflation during implementation, and the potential cost \nof  defending  construction  claims  lodged  by  contractors.  To  mitigate  these  risks, \nthe PMCBU will (a) use conservative cost estimates; (b) use strict and effective \ncontract  conditions  to  mitigate  slow  contractor  performance;  (c)  develop \nmeasures  to  mitigate  uninsurable  risks  during  preparation  of  the  contract \ndocumentation  to  limit  the  employer\u2019s  exposure,  including  requirements  for \nforeign  exchange  hedging  by  contractors;  and  (d)  require  a  guarantee  by  the \ncontractor  for  1  year  following  rehabilitation  to  ensure  construction  quality. \nGovernment  budgetary  allocations \nfor  counterpart  contributions  could  be \ninadequate  because  of  poor  national  financial  management.  Ongoing  programs \nsupported  by  development  partners  are  strengthening \nthe  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary processes, financial management systems, and provincial governance \nand will thus improve the environment for project implementation and institutional \ncapacity  building.  ADB  project  and  TA  review  missions,  as  well  as  country \nconsultation  missions,  will  engage  in  regular  dialogue  to  maintain  support  and \ncommitment. ADB also will continue to work closely with development partners to \npromote sector governance improvements. \n\nEnvironmental  risks.  Civil  works,  including  material  acquisition,  could  create \nnegative  impacts  on  the  environment.  Although  the  high  rainfall  climate, \necologically  sensitive  coastal  and  forested  landscapes,  and  high  level  of \nbiodiversity  and  endemism  provide  a  high  potential  for  environmental  impacts, \nactivities  will  be  undertaken  in  a  narrow  corridor.  The  Project  will  not  disturb \nmajor  habitats,  most  activities  will  be  in  areas  previously  used  for  similar \ninfrastructure,  and  an  environmental  management  plan  will  be  put  in  place  for \neach  set  of  subprojects.  Adherence  to  best  engineering  practices  during \nrehabilitation,  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  EMMP,  will  avoid  or  adequately \nmitigate  all  of  the  rehabilitation-related  impacts.  There  are  increasing  risks  of  a \ngreater  frequency  or  severity  of  natural  events  caused  by  climate  change.  The \nrisks  to  rehabilitated  infrastructure  are  mitigated  by  using  higher  engineering \nstandards for construction.  \n\n(iv) \n\nLand  and  material  acquisition  risks.  Landowners  and  rural  populations  are \nexpected to welcome rehabilitation for social and economic benefits. The existing \npractice  in  Solomon  Islands  is  for  local  landowners  to  grant  access  to  local \nmaterials  as  their  counterpart  contribution.  Existing  policies  of  the  Government \nand  development  partners  supporting  counterpart  contributions  will  mitigate  the \nrisk of demands for compensation.  \n\n(v) \n\nSocial  and  post-conflict  environment  risks.  Social  risks  occur  through \npossible  encroachment  of  project  activities  onto  customary  land  or  areas  of \ncultural  significance;  and  through  demand  for  resources  such  as  water,  gravel, \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fand sand, without prior discussion with local land or resource owners. The post-\nconflict  environment  is  stable,  particularly  in  the  affected  areas  which  were \nrelatively uninvolved in the original conflict, and the economy is recovering. The \nbusiness  environment  is  increasingly  positive,  as  contractors  and  consultants \nrespond  to  business  opportunities.  If  political  instability  increases  or  the  peace \nand  order  situation  deteriorates,  prospective  bidders  might  have  less  interest  in \nthe Project, increasing tender prices. This also could reduce community support \nfor  the  Project.  These  risks  can  be  managed  in  each  subproject  through  prior \ndiscussions  with  local  landowners,  in  cooperation  with  ongoing  community \ndevelopment assistance provided by development partners. \n\n(vi) \n\nGovernance risks. Civil works and consulting contracts implemented by EAs are \nsubject  to  risks  of  inappropriate  procurement  and  potentially  corrupt  practices. \nThe Government has well-documented procedures that require all contracts to be \nprocured  through  a  ministerial  tender  board.  ADB  TA  has  also  helped \nGovernment  develop  a  contract  procedures  manual  for  major,  minor,  and \ncommunity contracts. All procedures are advertised and implemented publicly.  \n\n86. \nAn  analysis  of  the  project  risks  shows  the  potential  adverse  social  and  environmental \nimpacts  not  to  be  significant  and  capable  of  mitigation.  Cost  and  implementation  risks  will  be \nmanaged through the proposed approach to contractor selection, contract conditions, financial \nincentives, and penalties to avoid the late performance problems of previous projects. The risks \nare manageable and do not constitute barriers to successful project implementation.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n87. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCounterpart  contributions.  The  Government  shall  allocate,  on  a  timely  basis, \nadequate counterpart funds in accordance with its disaster recovery action plan. \nThe Government shall ensure that MID has adequate budget to maintain staffing \nand  support \ntransport  and  subsistence \nincluding \nallowances for staff participating in field activities.   \n\nits  routine  operations, \n\nCofinancing. The Government shall take all necessary measures to facilitate the \ntimely  mobilization  of  the  necessary  cofinancing  required  for  implementing  the \nProject. In the event that cofinancing from the EC does not become available, the \nGovernment shall consult ADB to reduce the scope of the Project, or make other \narrangements acceptable to ADB to cover the funding shortfall. \n\nSubproject  selection.  Prior  to  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  the \nGovernment  shall  obtain  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  inclusion  of  the  subproject \nfor  financing  under  the  Project,  based  on  the  appraisal  and  selection  criteria \nagreed between the Government and ADB. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  all \nproject  rehabilitation  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  rights-of-way.  In  the \nevent of any unforeseen land acquisition or resettlement needs, the Government \nshall  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  applicable  laws \nand \nInvoluntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The Government, through the PMCBU, shall ensure \nthat no construction activities begin until ADB has reviewed and approved such \nresettlement plan. \n\nframework,  and  ADB\u2019s \n\nresettlement \n\nregulations, \n\nthe \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\nthe  sector  project  shall  commence  until \n\nEnvironment. The Government shall ensure that (a) the Project is carried out in \naccordance with applicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, \n(b)  no  civil  works  under \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s environment agency has cleared the environmental assessment of \nany  subproject,  (c)  the  IEE  and  preliminary  EMMP  are  prepared  in  accordance \nwith  the  EARP,  reviewed  and  updated  at  the  engineering  design  stage,  and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval, (d) the Project complies with the EMMP reflected \nin the updated IEE, (e) the EMMP is reflected as part of bidding documents and \ncivil works contracts, (f) civil works contractors are closely supervised to ensure \nthat  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project  are  minimized  by \nimplementing  the  agreed  mitigating  measures  and  standard  operating  practices \nare changed to avoid their recurrence. \n\nGender  and  employment.  The  Government  shall:  (a)  encourage  project \ncontractors  to  employ  women  in  rehabilitation  and  labor-intensive  maintenance; \n(b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of equal type, in accordance \nwith  national  laws  and  international  treaty  obligations;  (c)  provide  safe  working \nconditions for male and female workers; and (d) ensure that project contractors \ncomply  with  applicable  labor  laws  and  abstain  from  child  labor.  Specific \nprovisions to this effect shall be included in the bidding documents.  \n\n(vii)  Health  risks.  The  Government,  through  the  PMCBU,  shall  ensure  that  all  civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  participate  in  an  HIV/AIDS \nprevention program to be funded under the Project in construction campsites. In \naddition, the PMCBU shall ensure that information on the risk of transmission of \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases  is  disseminated  to  local \ncommunities  in  coordination  with  national  agencies  working  on  the  issue.  The \nPMCBU shall also include specific provisions to this effect in civil works contracts \nand strictly monitor compliance. \n\n(viii)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 3 months of the grant \neffectiveness  date,  the  Government,  through  the  EA,  shall  finalize  and  adopt  a \nproject  performance  and  monitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on \nindicators  and  procedures  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  EA \nshall  monitor  the  indicators  according  to  the  agreed  framework  on  a  quarterly \nbasis  to  determine  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  Project,  and  shall \nprovide \nthe  commencement  of  project \nimplementation until completion. \n\nto  ADB  monitoring  reports \n\nfrom \n\nAnticorruption  measures.  The  Government  shall:  (a)  undertake  necessary \nmeasures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment; (b) ensure that its \nanticorruption  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  strictly \nenforced  and  are  being  complied  with  during  project  implementation,  and  that \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  all  bidding \ndocuments for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or \ncoercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  (d)  ensure  that  the  EA  conducts \nperiodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe  Project  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n88. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  of  $4,950,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Emergency  Assistance \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  Agreement \npresented to the Board herewith, and;  \n\nthe administration by ADB of loans or grants in accordance with the proposal set \nforth  in  paragraph  50  of  this  Report  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Emergency \nAssistance Project, to be provided by any development partner or cofinancier on \na loan or a grant basis after the date of the Board's approval for such Project. \n\n89. \nI also recommend that the Board approve the administration by ADB of a grant from the \nEuropean Commission not exceeding the equivalent of $4,000,000 to Solomon Islands for the \nEmergency Assistance Project, provided that the Directors representing not less than two thirds \nof the total voting power of the members shall have approved, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the \nArticles  of  Agreement,  the  expansion  of  the  procurement  eligibility  for  the  road  rehabilitation \ncomponent  to  include  procurement  of  eligible  goods  and  services  from  countries  eligible  for \nprocurement under European Commission regulations. \n\n18 June 2007 \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nImpact \n\nNormal economic and \nsocial activities and \naccessibility resumed in \naffected areas \n\nOutcome \n\nAccess to markets for \nagricultural and fisheries \nproducts, social services, \nand tourism areas via land \ntransport restored \n \nAccess to markets for \nagricultural and fisheries \nproducts, social services, \nand tourism areas via sea \ntransport restored \n \nRisks to public health \ncaused by unreliable and \nunsafe town water system \nreduced \n\nEffective disaster recovery \ncoordination  \n\nReduced vulnerability of \ninfrastructure to hazards \n\nOutputs \n\n1.

Subprojects  will  be  selected  based  on  agreed  eligibility \ncriteria (section B).  \n\n2. \nRoads to be rehabilitated are gravel and earthen roads, which have been damaged due \nto  seismic  and  tsunami  action.  Road  surfaces  are  heavily  scoured  and  covered  with  debris. \nRoadside  drains  and  most  culverts  are  silted  or  blocked  and  a  number  of  culverts  have  been \ndamaged.  \n \n3. \nMany bridges and their foundations and abutments, which were not designed for seismic \nactivities, have been completely destroyed. A few bridges appear to be in satisfactory condition \nor  in  need  of  minor  repairs  but  will  require  thorough  investigation  for  seismic  loading  as  the \nearthquake destabilized their foundations and they may no longer be sound for heavy loads.  \n \nSimilarly,  many  wharves  were  damaged.  In  some  cases  only  the  superstructure  is \n4. \ndamaged  and  in  need  of  repairs.    In  others,  the  gabions,  abutments,  and  foundations  have \nsuffered  major  damage,  and  in  a  few  cases  the  structures  have  been  completely  destroyed. \nPotential underground and underwater damages will require further investigation \n \n5. \nThe Gizo water supply is operational but damaged. The distribution main from the intake \nto  the  storage  reservoir  was  broken  in  several  locations,  the  intake  capacity  needs \nimprovement,  the  distribution  main  upgraded,  and  water  storage  capacity  and  purification \nincreased. Sanitation facilities also require attention. \n \n6. \nRehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  investigation  and  design  criteria,  though  a \nrange  of  engineering  solutions  will  be  considered.  Assessments  will  include  analysis  of  least \ncost alternatives including full life cycle costs, potential environmental impact, and sustainability \nto natural hazards. \n\nSubproject Eligibility Criteria  \n\nB. \n\n7. \n\nSubprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  subprojects  will  rehabilitate  infrastructure  assessed  as  high  development \npriorities  based  on  their  contribution  to  the  objectives  of  the  NERDDP, \nparticularly: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nimproved  accessibility \nhouseholds, \nextension services; \n\nincluding  schools,  health \n\nto  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nfacilities,  and  Government \n\nrestored  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  among \npoor and rural households; and  \n\ncontribution  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  among  poor  and \nrural households. \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  endorse  the  subprojects  through  the  project  steering \ncommittee. \n\n8. \nSubprojects will be economically viable, and will demonstrate an appropriate economic \ninternal  rate  of  return.  An  economic  analysis  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). In addition \nto standard parameters1 of analysis, subprojects will be assessed for their contribution to: \n\npotential for restoration of agricultural production; \n\npotential for restoration of exports of agricultural and marine products;  \n\npotential for restoration of tourism; \n\nemployment  of  local  communities  and  contractors  for  maintenance  and  small \nscale works;  \n\nrestoration of incomes, particularly among poor and rural households; and \n\ncontribution to economic growth. \n\n9. \nEnvironmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects in accordance with ADB's \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). In selecting subproject sites, including extraction \nsites for materials to be imported to construction sites, the following environmental  criteria will \nbe used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, \nthen  the  subproject  will  require  the  production  and  approval  of  an  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA), following the procedures and requirements of an environmental category A \nproject according to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines: \n\nsites in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive; \n\nrequirement for major re-alignment of an existing road or complete relocation of \nan existing bridge or wharf that may cause significant environmental impacts; \n\nsignificant  adverse  impacts  on  natural/primary  forest  or  near-shore  marine \nenvironments such as reefs, mangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n\npermanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n\npermanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n10. \nScreening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects.  Any  subproject  that  would  entail  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) will require production of a resettlement plan according \nto relevant laws and regulations, the Resettlement Framework, and ADB guidelines.2 \n\n                                                 \n1 Such as assessments of alternative modes of transport, full life cycle costs of rehabilitation and maintenance, traffic \nforecasts based on forecast economic growth and income elasticity of travel demand in project areas, and use of \nappropriate shadow pricing and conversion factors for economic benefits. \n\n2  \u201cInvoluntary  resettlement\u201d  addresses  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are  permanent  or  temporary  and  are  (i) \ncaused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on \nland as a result of an ADB operation. An \u201caffected person\u201d is one who experiences such impacts. The term affected \nperson includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions who, on account of changes that result from \nthe  project  will  have  their  (i)  standard  of  living  adversely  affected;  (ii)  right,  title,  or  interest  in  any  house,  land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water resources, or any other moveable \nor  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or \ntemporarily;  and/or  (iii)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work  or  residence,  or  habitat  adversely  affected,  with  or \nwithout displacement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSubproject Assessment Process \n\n11. \nA  long  list  of  potential  subprojects  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  based  on  high-level \nassessments  of  (i)  existing  networks  and  levels  of  usage;  (ii)  technical  feasibility  of  providing \naccess  by  alternative  modes;  (iii)  positive  and  negative  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nimpacts;  (iv)  the  need  for  connecting  infrastructure,  and  (v)  implications  of  any  proposed \nchanges  to  spatial  planning  or  land  use  rezoning.  Subprojects  will  be  restricted  to  facilities \ndamaged in the disaster. \n\nThe Executing Agency, assisted by the Project Management and Capacity Building Unit \n12. \n(PMCBU), will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject based on the criteria \ndescribed in Section B. Each assessment will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to \ndetermine  the  detailed  feasibility  and  impacts  expected,  using  generally  accepted  planning \nmethods.  Community  consultations  will  be  conducted  to  (i)  validate  baseline  data;  (ii)  identify \npositive  and  negative  impacts;  and  (iii)  evaluate  technical,  social,  and  environmental  risks. \nThroughout  the  process,  particular  attention  shall  be  paid  to  data  collection  to  enable  benefit \nmonitoring, according to the performance indicators described in Appendix 10. \n\n13. \nEach  subproject  assessment  will  include  (i)  a  technical  feasibility  assessment;  (ii)  an \neconomic  impact  analysis;  (iii)  a  social  and  poverty  analysis;  and  (iv)  an  initial  environmental \nexamination and a full EIA if warranted, in accordance with the environmental assessment and \nreview procedures. Each component of the assessment will confirm acceptable ratings against \nthe criteria, or recommend further work to complete the assessment.  \n\n14. \nThe transport task force, in its capacity as the  project steering committee, will endorse \nthe subprojects that meet all the eligibility criteria. Before the detailed design of any subproject, \nand its inclusion for financing under the Project, proposed subprojects are subject to approval \nby ADB.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\n \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nQ1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4 \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJul \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nProject Component \n\nGrant Effectiveness \n\nProject Management \n\nPMCBU recruitment \n\nPre-feasibility, \nsubproject \nidentification  \n\nPublic consultations \n\nFeasibility studies  \nDetailed design and \npreparation of bidding \ndocuments \n\nTendering, evaluation, \nand mobilization \n\nCivil Works \n\nRehabilitation of roads \n\nRehabilitation of \nbridges \n\nRehabilitation of \nwharves \n\nRehabilitation of water \nsupply and sanitation \n\n \n\n \n\nRoad maintenance \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nRecruitment \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nMID = Ministry of Infrastructure Development, PMCBU = Project Management and Capacity Building Unit  \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nCountry \n\nName of Grantee \n\nProject Name \n\nProject Reference \n\nDate of Effectiveness \n\nAmount \n\nOf which, Committed  \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nMASTER PROCUREMENT PLAN \n\n \n\nTable A5.1: Project Information \n\nSolomon Islands \n\nGovernment of Solomon Islands \n\nEmergency Assistance Project \n\nSOL 41105 \n\nJuly 2007* \n\n$9.75 million \n\n\u2014 \n\nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan \n\nJune 2007* \n\nApproval of Most Recent Procurement Plan \n\nJune 2007* \n\nPublication for Local Advertisements \n\nExpressions of Interest: August 2007* \n\nMinistry of Infrastructure Development \n\nGeneral Procurement Notice: August 2007* \n\nInvitation for Bids: November 2007* \n\nPeriod Covered By This Plan \n\nJuly 2007\u2013December 2007  \n\n* = estimated date \n\u2014 = not applicable \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTable A5.2: Procurement Thresholds for Works, Goods, and Related Services \n\nValue To Be Used Above  \n($) \n\n$1,000,000\n\n$500,000\n\nLess than $1,000,000\n\nLess than $500,000\n\nLess than $100,000\n\nLess than $100,000\n\nLess than $50,000\n\nProcurement Method  \n\nICB Works \n\nICB Goods \n\nNCB Works \n\nNCB Goods \n\nShopping Works \n\nShopping Goods \n\nExceptional Methods: \n\nCommunity participation in procurement will be \nemployed for small scale works and \nmaintenance, in which local groups are \ncontracted for routine road maintenance. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\fTable A5.3: Procurement Thresholds for Consulting Services \n\nProcurement Method  \n\nValue To be Used Above  \n($) \n\nQuality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)\n\nConsultants Qualifications Selection  \n\nLeast-Cost Selection  \n\nExceptional Methods \n\nSingle source selection will be used to \nselect consulting services due to the \nemergency nature of the Project. \n\n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nLess than $650,000\n\nTable A5.4: Contract Packages Exceeding $100,000 for Goods, Works, and Consulting \nServices \n\nRef \n\nContract \nDescription \n\nEstimated \nCost \n\nProcurement \nMethod \n\nExpected Date \nof \nAdvertisement \n\nPrior \nReview \nY/N \n\nComments \n\n($) \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n5 \n\nCivil Works \u2013 \nroads \n\nCivil Works \u2013 \nwharves \n\nCivil Works \u2013 \nwater supply \n/sanitation \n\nCivil Works -

The PMCBU will be tasked with providing similar project management \nfor the Solomon Islands Emergency Assistance Project (SIEAP), as necessary to implement the \nProject successfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines.  \n\n2. \nAlthough  the  PMCBU  is  fully  integrated  with  MID  professional  and  technical  staff  as \ncounterparts,  the  volume  and  schedule  of  existing  activities  under  SIRIP  and  MID\u2019s  limited \ntechnical  staff  resources  mean  that  the  PMCBU  needs  to  be  supplemented  with  additional \nsupport  for  these  services.  Consultants  will  be  selected  through  a  firm  using  ADB\u2019s  single \nsource selection procedure. At the request of the Government, ADB will recruit the consultants.1  \n\nB. \n\nScope of Work \n\n3. \nThe  PMCBU  will  (i)  provide  day  to  day  project  management  in  the  role  of  resident \nengineer,  (ii)  conduct  on-site  field  supervision;  (iii)  manage  contracts,  including  those  for \ncommunity  maintenance;  (iv)  prepare  withdrawal  applications;  (v)  prepare  project  progress \nreports, socioeconomic and environmental impact monitoring reports, and a project completion \nreport; and (vi) maintain project accounts for auditing. \n\n4. \nThe  team  may  include  but  is  not  necessarily  limited  to  a  resident  engineer,  two  works \nsupervisors, and a community works coordinator, along with appropriate levels of support staff. \nThe  PMCBU  follows  national  labor  regulations,  and  is  expected  to  offer  equal  opportunities  to \nwomen and minorities. The consultants will work through the PMCBU, reporting to the existing \nProject Manager, to support MID in implementing the Project in the following areas: \n\nResident Engineer (International, 18 person months) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSupervise  preliminary  and  final  technical  documentation,  including  engineering \ndesign  and  specifications,  for  subprojects.  Technical  documentation  from \nongoing  ADB  projects  and  TA  can  be  adapted.  Designs  should  be  based  on \nleast-cost life cycle analysis of available local materials and procedures. \nAdminister,  implement,  and  monitor  international  and  local  contracts  for  civil \nworks, equipment, and consulting services under the Project. \nEstablish  a  project  performance  and  monitoring  system,  in  accordance  with  the \ndesign and monitoring framework, guidelines for project performance monitoring \nindicators,  environmental  management  plans,  and  environmental  assessment \nand review procedures, all of which are appendices in the RRP. \nEstablish  and  administer  a  financial  management  system  for  the  Project  in \naccordance  with  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  guidelines  for  the \nfinancial governance and management of projects,2 concerning administration of \nimprest  account  replenishment,  submission  of  withdrawal \ndisbursements, \napplications, and arrangement of direct payments to contractors. \n\n                                                 \n1  Specialized  technical  support  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  and  improve  community  consultations  in \n\nresponse to the disaster will also be provided under technical assistance (TA) as described in Appendix 7 \n\n2  ADB.  2003.

Islands  in  these  two  provinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to \nhousing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities, and several villages were destroyed. An \nestimated 20,000 people of a total population of 90,000 in both provinces have been affected. \nAbout 5,000 people were displaced and 52 people died. \n\nThe  Emergency  Assistance  Project  will  restore  economic  and  social  activities  and \n2. \naccessibility in the affected area to the pre-disaster level and make it less susceptible to future \nnatural disasters. The Project will assist the government in rehabilitating damaged infrastructure \nand make it less vulnerable to climate change.  \n\nThe  disaster  has  revealed  a  need  to  improve  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \n3. \nemergency  response,  improve  infrastructure  analysis  and  planning,  and  develop  an  effective \nframework  for  mitigating  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  Developing  a  reconstruction  strategy \nrequires vision, the focus and involvement of the communities affected, strong implementation \narrangements  and  monitoring  systems.  In  devising  a  strategy  to  guide  the  reconstruction \nprocess,  decision  makers  should  build  on  the  damage  assessment  by:  (i)  developing  a \nreconstruction  strategy  through  a  consultative  process;  (ii)  rapidly  mobilizing  of  reconstruction \nfunds  and  activities;  (iii)  focusing  on  the  needs  of  the  local  population;  (iv)  establishing  the \nhighest  fiduciary  standards  and  efficient  system  managing  the  funds,  and  (v)  updating  and \nmonitoring  needs  and  results.  Community  consultation  is  imperative  to  devising  the  plan  for \nreconstructing. \n\nImplementing  that  plan  and  coordinating  all  elements  of  what  will  be  an  extremely \n4. \ncomplex  undertaking  is  just  as  crucial.  Rebuilding  the  affected  areas  will  involve  all  levels  of \ngovernment from national to village as well as domestic and international organizations, bilateral \nand  multilateral  institutions,  donors  and  community  groups.  Coordinating  these  organizations \nwithin the overall recovery and reconstruction process is a major task. One international advisor \nand two local coordinators will be required to meet this challenge. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\n5. \nThe  goals  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  are  to  strengthen  disaster  management, \ninfrastructure planning, and capacity to ensure that infrastructure designs incorporate adaptation \nand  mitigation  strategies  and  are  less  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  potential  future \ndisasters.  \n\n6. \nThe  outcomes  will  (i)  strengthen  disaster  and  emergency  management  by  establishing \nan effective coordination process across relevant ministries to administer the current and future \nrecovery  response  operations,  and  (ii) \nimprove  assessment,  analysis,  and  subproject \npreparation  in  the  affected  areas  that  incorporate  climate  change  adaptation,  thereby  helping \nGovernment  develop  an  effective  approach  to  mitigating  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  adverse \nweather conditions. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nC. \n\nOutline Terms of Reference \n\n7. \nApproximately  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  126  person-\nmonths of national consulting services are required in total. Consulting services will be required \nfor two components as described below. \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1\u2014Disaster Recovery Coordination \n\n8. \nComponent  1  of  the  TA  for  disaster  management  will  provide  technical  support  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s newly-established Finance and Economic Development Unit (FEDU) to develop \nand  maintain  the  coordination  process  in  Honiara  and  the  affected  areas  in  Western  and \nChoiseul  provinces.  The  component  will  improve  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \nemergency response and develop an effective framework for mitigating vulnerability to climate \nchange by establishing an effective response capability through efficiently coordinated networks \nacross  relevant  ministries  to  administer  the  current  and  future  recovery  response  operations. \nImplementation  will  require  a  transition  from  ongoing  arrangements  and  responsibilities  of  the \nNational  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO),  and  the  Ministry  of  National  Development \nPlanning and Aid Coordination\u2014Technical Assessment Team (MDP/TAT).  \n\nConsultants  for  Component  1  will  be  selected  as  individuals.  Three  consultants  are \n\n9. \nrequired as follows \n\nAdviser for Disaster Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (International, 4 person months) \n\n10. \nThe adviser will be in a facilitating role supporting the transition of responsibilities from \nthe  NDMO  and  MDP/TAT  to  the  FEDU,  in  direct  support  of  Government  and  involving  all \nstakeholders through the reconstruction and rehabilitation process. The adviser will work closely \nwith  MOF  and  the  Director  of  the  FED  and  in  coordination  with  all  relevant  stakeholders.  The \nnature of the work will require flexibility, depending on developments and emerging priorities in \nthe  course  of  the  assignment.

Yes \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n\nContribution of the sector and/or subsector to poverty reduction in Solomon Islands:  \n\nOn 2 April 2007 a massive undersea earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami \nthat  struck  the  islands  of  Choiseul,  Gizo,  Kolombangara,  Mono,  New  Georgia,  Ranongga,  Rendova, \nShortlands, Simbo, and Vella Lavella in Western and Choiseul Provinces. There is concern on the impact \nof this natural disaster on coastal vulnerability, ground water levels, agriculture, fisheries and livelihoods.  \n\nAll islands in the two affected provinces suffered widespread damage from the earthquake and tsunami to \nhousing, infrastructure, schools, and medical facilities. Several villages were completely destroyed. Most \nof the people from the affected areas have been traumatized by the event and have fled to higher ground \nwhere  they  are  being  housed  in  makeshift  camps.    Health  conditions  in  the  camps  are  inadequate  with \nregard  to  water,  food,  sanitation  and  medical  support.  Immediate  food  availability  is  also  a  concern  and  \naccess for food security issues must be addressed. \n\nThe  Solomon  Islands  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (SIEAP)  will  restore  access  to  the  highest  priority \ntransport infrastructure, social services and provide safe water. It will also facilitate positive social impacts \nincluding  the  restoration  of  access  to  education  facilities,  which  will  help  maintain  school  enrolment  and \nretention  rates,  and  restoration  of  access  to  health  services,  which  will  promote  more  frequent  use  and \nfacilitate  rapid  care  during  medical  emergencies.  Other  indirect  social  benefits  include  restoration  of \naccess to administrative and service centers, including communication facilities. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nPoverty and Human Development in Western and Choiseul Provinces: \n\nA recent ADB participatory poverty assessment identified that poverty of opportunity exists in the country. \nThere  is  also  rural  poverty  in  terms  of  access  to  basic  needs  and  infrastructure.  To  a  certain  extent, \npoverty of opportunity has resulted from \u201cmisuse\u201d whereby the resources available to the country are used \nto satisfy the wants of a few while many do not have even their basis needs met.  The role of government \nin  poverty  reduction  is  in  the  area  of  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  that  the  poor  and  disadvantaged \ncannot be excluded from.   \n\nPeople  from  the  Choiseul  Provinces  are  socio-economically  and  environmentally  vulnerable  poor  due  to \nthe low coverage of basic transport infrastructure and water supply facilities. Western Province is slightly \nbetter off than Choiseul through having more transport infrastructure coverage resulting in more economic \nactivities especially in terms of tourism.   \n\nFor  example,  Western  Province  has  an  adult  literacy  rate  of  94%,  the  highest  in  the  country  (including \nHoniara) and considerably greater than the national average of 76.6%1. A major contributing factor is the \nnumber of schools, with Western Province having the highest number of schools in the country, and their \nrelatively even distribution among populated areas. Enrolment rates (5\u201319 year olds) in Western Province \nare 65.4%, well above the national average of 56.3%2.  \n\nPrior  to  the  disaster,  Western  province  was  second  only  to  Honiara  in  terms  of  accessibility  to  health \n\n                                                 \n\n1 1999 Population and Housing Census.  \n\n2 1999 Population and Housing Census. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\nservices,  when  accessibility  is  defined  as  being  within  one  hour  or  less  of  health  services  using  the \nprevailing  mode  of  transport.  Some  73.1%  of  WP\u2019s  population  enjoyed  such  access.  Gizo  is  also  well \nserviced,  having  two  of  the  three  hospitals  in  the  \u201cNorth  Solomon  region\u201d  (Western  and  Choiseul \nProvinces), with the other one being located in Munda. \n\nHuman development refers to development that improves peoples\u2019 lives and livelihood, and places people \nat  the  heart  or  centre  of  all  other  development  efforts.  It  refers  to  the  process  of  enlarging  the  range  of \npeople\u2019s choices \u2013 increasing their opportunities for education, health care, income and employment, and \ncovering  a  full  range  of  human  choices,  from  a  sound  physical  environment  to  economic  and  political \nfreedom.    It  also  involves  an  accumulation  of  material  wealth  as  well  as  social  capital.    The  SIEAP  is \ndesigned  to  rehabilitate  transport  infrastructure  which  addresses  the  real  root  causes  of  poverty  and \nhuman deprivation.   \n\nHuman development in the Solomon Islands calls for a basic needs approach.  The basic needs identified \ninclude  two  elements:  (a)  minimum  requirements  of  a  family  for  private  consumption\u2014adequate  food, \nshelter and clothing, as well as certain household equipment and furniture. (b) Essential services provided \nby and for the community\u2014 such as safe drinking water, sanitation, public transport, health, education and \ncultural facilities. This approach relies on the participation of people.   \n\nThe initial social assessment (ISA) of SIEAP focused on the population affected directly or indirectly by the \nearthquake and tsunami in Western and Choiseul Provinces. The ISA was carried out in two stages. The \nfirst  stage  involved  gathering  and  analyzing  secondary  data  on  the  population  living  within  the  affected \nareas,  including  information  on  poverty,  human  development,  livelihoods,  and  accessibility  of  social \nservices.  Sources  of  preliminary  secondary  data  include  the  1997  census,  United  Nations  Development \nProgram  Provincial  Development  Profiles,  the  2002  Solomon  Islands  Human  Development  Report,  and \nNational  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  and  the  most  recently  completed  Participatory \nPoverty Assessment. More in-depth secondary data possibly may be obtained from line ministries.  \n\nThe  second  stage  of  the  ISA  involved  direct  engagement  with  appropriate  stakeholders  within  the  two \naffected provinces. The impact assessment involved a combination of key informant interviews and where \nappropriate,  focus  group  discussion  with  a  range  of  stakeholders,  social  networks  (such  as  church \nwomen\u2019s  groups  identified  by  leaders  of  affected  communities),  and  disadvantaged  groups  including \nwomen, old people, and transport providers.  \n\nDamages, Losses and Earthquake/Tsunami impacts: \n\nThe loss of human lives due to the earthquake and tsunami was amplified by the destruction of properties, \nlivelihoods  and  social  and  transport  infrastructure.  The  poverty  impact  of  the  disaster  is  localized  and \nexperienced  more  severely  at  the  village  and  community  levels,  especially  for  households  involved  in \nfishing,  gardening  and  village-based  micro-enterprises.  This  destruction  added  to  their  hardship  and \nincreased their poverty of opportunity. \n\nDestruction  of  roads,  bridges,  wharves,  jetties,  water  sources  and  water  supply  facilities  has  disrupted \nmobility  and  accessibility  of  the  affected  communities  to  essential  social,  economic  and  relief  services. \nSince  damage  is  largely  confined  to  rural  areas,  the  incidence  and  severity  of  rural  poverty  is  likely  to \nincrease among affected communities. \n\nThe most damage was sustained on Gizo and Choiseul islands.  About 20,000 people of a total population \nof 90,000 in Western and Choiseul Provinces have been affected, with about 5,000 people displaced and \n52 dead.  Infrastructure damages are described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts: \n\nThe  goal  of  the  project  is  to  restore  economic  and  social  activities  and  accessibility  in  affected  areas  to \npre-disaster  levels  and  increase  sustainability.  The  purpose  is  to  assist  the  government  in  rehabilitating \ndamaged  infrastructure  and  make  it  less  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  natural  hazards.  The \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  is  expected  to  restore  accessibility  in  rural  areas,  allow  a \nresumption of economic activities and social services, and safeguard public health. \n\nThe project will address the repair and re-construction of physical infrastructure including; rural and town \nroads, bridges and culverts, wharves and jetties, and the Gizo town water supply.  Reconstruction will be \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nrequired  for  (i)  existing  facilities  in  their  present  locations  and  (ii)  where  facilities  are  so  badly  damaged \nnew facilities may be erected in their present location. \n\nRestored water supply in Gizo town will improve overall public health. It will also reduce women\u2019s drudgery \non  collecting/storing  water  and  accrue  improved  health,  hygiene  and  productivity  benefits  to  the \ncommunity,  especially  women  and children.  Reconstruction  of  localized  wharves  and  jetties  will  improve \nrural market and fish landings as well as commercially important products such as copra and cocoa. It will \nalso  improve  local  access  to  essential  services  and  support  local  livelihoods  through  labor  opportunities \nduring implementation. The transportation component will restore provincial roads and bridges, thereby re-\nconnecting  the  loss  networks  which  will  enable  affected  population  to  resume  social  and  economic \nactivities.  \n\n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \n\nThe  SIEAP  preparation  involved  the  identification  and  consultation  of  key  primary  and  secondary \nstakeholders,  especially  during  the  joint  assessment  of  needs  and  damages.    The  key  primary \nstakeholders are  the earthquake and  tsunami affected  communities  in  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces. \nOther  primary  stakeholders  are  small  farmers,  women  engaged  in  village-based  micro-enterprises  and \nvulnerable groups such as the disabled and old people. \n\nThe secondary or institutional stakeholders include the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), the \nprovincial  governments  of  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces,  international  relief  and  reconstruction \nagencies and other donor agencies such as NZAID and AusAID.   \n\nThese  same  stakeholders  also  will  have  opportunity  to  provide  inputs  and  comments  during  the \nimplementation stage, which is being led by the NDMO.  \n\nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \n\nA  community  participation  strategy  is  integrated  into  the  overall  project  design.    The  reconstruction  and \nrecovery strategy emphasizes (i) utilizing decentralized and transparent decision making and community \nparticipation  processes;  (ii)  providing  employment  opportunities  to  earthquake  and  tsunami  affected \ncommunities;  (iii)  building  good working  relationships  with  implementing  agencies,  church  networks,  and \ncommunity-based  institutions;  (iv)  strengthening  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  capacity  of  the \nprovincial  governments.  Participatory  approaches  will  be  encouraged \nin  designing  subprojects, \nimplementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements.  The process \nwill involve information sharing, consultations, interviews, focus group discussions, collaborative decision \nmaking. The subproject selection criteria include targeting of most affected groups, especially women and \nthe newly vulnerable groups, community consultations on subprojects, practical and feasible mechanisms \nsuch as labor based equipment supported (LBES) reconstruction works, preferential use of local labor and \nlocal procurement for livelihood support. \n\n \n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nThe  SIEAP  will  restore  and  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  income  generating  activities,  essential  social \nservices,  community  structures,  decision-making  mechanisms  and  other \nrecovery  and \nreconstruction-related information. Improved water supply infrastructure and other public health and health \ncare  benefits  to  women  and  their  families  and  provide  more  time  for  productive  income-generating \nactivities by reducing the drudgery of collecting water. \n\nlocal \n\nThe SIEAP will be proactive in ensuring that women are involved in suitable infrastructure reconstruction \nand rehabilitation works. \n\nHas an output been prepared?

The  force  of  the  earthquake  was  such  that  the  physical \nenvironment  of  the  islands  and  reefs  changed.  One  side  of  Ranongga  Island  lifted  some  3 \nmeters  and  some  of  the  adjacent  islands  and  reefs  of  Simbo  and  Rendova  sunk,  causing \nconcern about the impact on coastal vulnerability, ground water levels, agriculture, fisheries and \nlivelihoods.  \n\n2. \nAll  islands  in  the  affected  provinces  suffered  widespread  damage  to  housing, \ninfrastructure, schools, and medical facilities. Several villages were completely destroyed. Most \npeople  from  the  affected  areas  have  been  traumatized  by  the  events  and  have  fled  to  higher \nground where they are being housed in makeshift camps.  Health conditions in the camps are \ninadequate with regard to water, food, sanitation and medical support.  \n\n3. \nThe  Government  formally  requested  ADB,  on  the  basis  of  a  Cabinet  decision,  to  help \ncoordinate the reconstruction and rehabilitation process. To assist in planning its response, ADB \nrequires  that  the  interventions  be  assessed  for  their  possible  impact  on  environmental  values. \nThis Summary Initial Environment Examination (SIEE) report aims to (i) describe the Solomon \nIslands  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (SIEAP),  (ii)  describe  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts and corresponding mitigation measures, and (iii) explain the environmental assessment \nand review procedures that will be adopted during project implementation. The SIEE procedure \nfollows ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) as \nwell  as  the  Australian  Government\u2019s  Environment  Protection  and  Biodiversity  Conservation \n(EPBC) Act.  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of Project \n\nThe  goal  of  the  project  is  to  restore  economic  and  social  activities  and  accessibility  in \n4. \naffected  areas  to  pre-disaster  levels  and  increase  sustainability.  The  purpose  is  to  assist  the \ngovernment  in  rehabilitating  damaged  infrastructure  and  make  it  less  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange and natural hazards. The rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is expected to restore \naccessibility  in  rural  areas,  allow  a  resumption  of  economic  activities  and  social  services,  and \nsafeguard public health., including: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\napproximately 35 km of rural and town roads. Road rehabilitation is expected to \ninclude  reshaping  and  resurfacing,  repair  of  drains,  and  repair  of  culverts  and \nother drainage structures. \n\nAbout  19  rural  bridges,  include  repair  of  foundations  and  abutments,  and  35 \nculverts and water crossings. \n\nAbout  five  wharves  and  jetties.  Wharf  and  jetty  rehabilitation  is  expected  to \ninclude repairs to above-water structures in about half the locations and complete \nreplacement in the other half. \n\nThe Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. Water supply rehabilitation is \nexpected  to  include  repairs  to  the  reservoir,  intake  structure,  pumps,  and \ndistribution system. Sanitation rehabilitation requires minor repairs. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nAll  structures  will  be  designed  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  they  can  withstand  future \n\n5. \nhigh levels of seismic activities, ocean waves and adverse climatic conditions.  \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n6. \nSolomon Islands is an archipelago in the Southwest Pacific about 1,900 km northeast of \nAustralia comprising some 992 islands stretching over a 1,450 km chain southeast from Papua \nNew  Guinea  across  the  Coral  Sea  to  Vanuatu.  The  terrain  ranges  from  rugged  mountainous \nvolcanic  islands  to  low  coral  atoll  islands  and  covers  a  total  land  area  of  28,370  km2  with  an \nExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 1.3 million km2. The six major island groups form two \nroughly parallel island chains, with Choiseul, Isabel, and Malaita in the northern group and New \nGeorgia, Guadalcanal, and Makira in the south.  \n\n7. \nThe  affected  islands  of  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces  include  Choiseul,  Gizo, \nKolombangara,  Mono,  New  Georgia,  Ranongga,  Rendova,  Shortlands,  Simbo,  and  Vella \nLavella. The large islands of Choiseul, New Georgia, Ranongga, Rendova, Kolombangara and \nVella  Lavella  have  rain-forested  mountain  ranges  of  mainly  volcanic  origin,  deeply entrenched \nnarrow  valleys,  and  coastal  belts  fringed  by  reefs  and  lined  with  coconut  palms.  The  smaller \nislands are low coral-based islands fringed with reefs. Western Province has an active volcano \non Simbo Islands and a marine volcano known as Kavachi. The country is geologically active, \nand earth tremors are frequent. The previous last major earthquake recorded was in 1977 when \nmore than 1,000 people were evacuated from the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal and resettled \non West Guadalcanal in the Aruligo area. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic soils \nto relatively infertile limestone-derived soils. \n\n8. \nThe  islands'  ocean-equatorial  climate  is  extremely  humid  throughout  the  year,  with  a \nmean temperature of 27\u00b0C and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is \nslightly cooler. From April to October, the southeast trade winds blow, gusting at times to over \n30 knots. November to March is the wet season which is typically warmer and is accompanied \nby the northwest monsoon. The Solomon Islands experiences adequate rainfall throughout, with \nHoniara recording an annual average rainfall of 3,100 mm. Rainfall is well distributed throughout \nthe year with the maximum and minimum monthly rainfall being 11% (Feb and March) and 6% \n(June)  of  the  total  annual  rainfall  respectively.  Cyclones  have  been  recorded  in  the  Solomon \nIslands in 1986 (Namu); 1993 (Nina); 1996 (Fergus); 2003 (Zoe) which have caused loss of life \nand resulted in heavy economic cost.  \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \nThe  Solomon  Islands  State  of  the  Environment  (SOE)  Report1  indicates  that  there  is \n9. \ngreater  animal  diversity  in  Solomon  Islands  than  anywhere  else  in  the  Pacific,  especially  in \navifauna. The plant life of the Solomon Islands also shows great diversity and endemism. Many \nunique species occur on only one or two islands making their populations vulnerable. \n\n10.  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces  have  two  provincially  designated  marine  protected \nareas or Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMA), and the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s (WWF) \nGizo  Marine  Protected  Areas.  WWF  also  included  the  Western  and  Choiseul  Provinces  under \nits Bismack Solomon Seas Programme. \n\n                                                 \n1  Leary,  T.  1993.

Apia, Western Samoa \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Development \n\n11.  Most of the Western and Choiseul populace live in rural areas and derive their income \nfrom  a  mix  of  subsistence  and  semi-commercial  agricultural  activities,  however  these  two \nprovinces also contribute to the export earning for the country from its copra, tuna cannery and \nlogging  activities.  Soltai  Ltd,  the  Solomon  Islands  Government  and  Western  Province  joint \nventure tuna fishing and cannery company at Noro, is the largest employer in the region with up \nto 200 personnel. Tourism, particularly diving, is also an important service industry for Western \nProvince.  However  growth  in  tourism  is  hampered  by  lack  of  infrastructure  and  transport \nlimitations. Much of the limited infrastructure in place has been destroyed by the earthquake and \ntsunami leaving even less basis for growth than before. \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nThe main objective of the Project is to put in place an emergency rehabilitation project to \nurgently  restore  physical  infrastructure  and  the  livelihoods  of  communities  that  have  been \ndevastated  by  the  tsunami  and  earthquake.  The  Environmental  Management  and  Monitoring \nPlan  (EMMP)  has  been  prepared  so  as  to  create  awareness  and  provide  guidance  within  the \nreconstruction teams. The adoption of the EMMP within the reconstruction process will ensure \nthat future environmental risks are lessened.  \n\nThe most damage was sustained on Gizo and Choiseul islands. Infrastructure damage \n\n13. \nincludes: \n\nRoads and bridges: On Gizo, about 17km of road, 11 bridges and 24 cross culverts were \ndestroyed  with  major  scouring  and  wash-out  of  road  pavement  materials.  On  Choiseul \nabout  23km  of  road  in  south  Choiseul,  24  bridges  and  24  culverts  were  completely \ndestroyed.  On  New  Georgia  island,  14.5km  of  roads  suffered  major  damage  and  5 \nbridges were completely destroyed. On Kolombangara island, one bridge was destroyed \nand a few isolated road sections suffered major damage. On Vella Lavella island, while \nthere  has  been  no  major  damage  to  the  road,  two  bridges  have  been  completely \ndestroyed. \n\nWharves  and  jetties:  Ranongga\u2019s  two  wharves  were  totally  destroyed.  The  earthquake \nlifted the island by about three meters and the formerly productive reef surrounding the \nisland  which  provided  the  main  source  of sea  food  is  exposed,  and  the  ecosystem will \ntake decades to re-establish.  On New Georgia and Kolombangara islands, the two main \nwharves  at  Munda  and  Ringi  Cove  were  completely  destroyed,  and  the  jetty  at  Nusa \nTupe island, which provided the main link and services for tourists to Gizo has also been \ncompletely destroyed. Munda wharf which provided services to populations on the south \nis no longer serviceable. On Rendova, the two main wharves, Ughele and Kokelo have \nbeen completely destroyed. On Vella Lavella two main wharves servicing the north east \npopulations at Lambulabu and Boro have also been completely destroyed. The wharf at \nVonunu did not sustain any major damage but the concrete apron to the deck and the \nprotection works to the causeway sustained major damage.  On Simbo Island, the 50 m \nbridge connecting the road to Nusa Simbo has been completely destroyed. Simbo island \nhas sunk by about 2 m. The wharf and the causeway at Legana Station have subsided \nand  are  under  water  during  high  tides  and  barely  exposed  during  low  tides.  Other \nwharves  destroyed  include  the  Korovou  and  Nila  wharves  on  Shortlands  and  the \nFalamae  wharf  on  Mono  Island.  Three  major  wharves  located  in  Choiseul  have  been \ntotally destroyed. These include Taro, Katurasele and Posaare wharves.  \n\nWater  Supply:  The  Gizo  water  supply  suffered  extensive  damage  from  the  earthquake \nand  tsunami.  The  earthquake  caused  ruptures  and  loosened  joints  of  the  water  pipes, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\ndestabilized  foundations  and  walls  of  reservoirs,  intakes,  and  storage  tanks,  blocked \nintake  sources  with  landslide  debris  and  boulders,  and  destabilized  the  foundations  of \nthe  pump-house.  The  tsunami  scoured  the  pipe  trenches  eroding  the  beddings  and \nbroke the water pipes at several locations. \n\nThe  project  will  address  the  repair  and  re-construction  of  physical  infrastructure \n14. \nincluding:  rural  and  town  roads,  bridges  and  culverts,  wharves  and  jetties,  and  the  Gizo  town \nwater supply. Reconstruction will be required for: (i) existing facilities in their present locations \nand  (ii)  where  facilities  are  so  badly  damaged  new  facilities  may  be  erected  in  the  same \nlocations, or they may be relocated. Where reconstruction activities are to be undertaken at pre-\nexisting  locations  there  will  be  few  environmental  concerns  as  the  facility  has  an  established \nfootprint  in  the  area  and  the  conditions  outlined  within  the  EMMP  can  be  applied. Where  new \nlocations  are  required  and  depending  on  the  magnitude  and  the  location  of  the  facility  to  be \nreconstructed, additional environmental assessment may be necessary.   \n\n15. \nIn designing the rehabilitation activities and in the conduct of actual construction works, \nlocal  communities  will  be  consulted  and  their  concerns  will  be  incorporated  in  the  plans  and \nprograms of activities.  \n\nE.  \n\nThe Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\nImpacts  have  been  identified  for  the  various  project  activities  for  pre-construction, \n16. \nconstruction  and  operation.  The  activities  mainly  relate  to  design  measures  and  construction \nimpacts.  While  many  different  types  of  infrastructure  reconstruction  will  be  addressed  by  the \nproject,  the  activities  that  have  been  identified  within  the  SIEE  and  EMMP  are  considered \nrepresentative of the expected range of activities. Within the EMMP, mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures are developed for each activity and responsibilities allocated for these. The EMMP is \ndescribed in the following sections for the activities according to pre-construction, construction \nand operation. A matrix of the EMMP is attached as Table A9.1.  \n\n1. \n\nPre-construction \n\n17. \nPre-construction  activities  address  design  and  planning  issues  and  include  (i)  siting  of \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  land  and  property  acquisition  (when  necessary)  and  social  concerns,  (iii) \nsourcing construction materials, and (iv) inclusion of seismic risk and projected climate change \nin  the  design.  These  issues  will  be  transferred  to  a  design  brief  which  identifies  the  Design \nEngineer as being responsible for addressing these issues. All of these issues will need to be \naddressed before reconstruction activities commence: \n\nSourcing  construction  materials:  Sources  of  rock,  gravel  and  sand  will  be  required  for \nreconstruction activities. Where existing sources are available with some form of  proxy \napproval, they can be used. Where new extraction sites are to be opened, approval will \nneed  to  be  obtained  from  the  relevant  authority  or  landowner.  Compensation  will  be \npayable  for  any  new  material  sites  that  are  located  on  private  land.  Selection  and \napproval of quarries and borrow pits will be the responsibility of the Design Engineer with \nassistance from the EMC. Ensuring operation follows approved quarries plans will be the \nresponsibility of the Supervising Engineer. \n\nInclusion of seismic risk in design: Assessment of the seismic risk and inclusion within \nthe design will be addressed by the Design Engineer. \n\nInclusion of climate proofing in design: Climate change is expected to increase extreme \nweather  events,  in  particular  intense  rainfall  and  wave  surges,  and  to  cause  sea  level \nrise.  While  climate  change  influenced  design  criteria  are  not  available  for  the  Solomon \nIslands  the  methodology  to  incorporate  climate  proofing  within  design  is  detailed  in  an \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nADB  publication.2  The  Design  Engineer  will  be  responsible  for  incorporating  climate \nchange requirements within the structural designs. \n\n2. \n\nConstruction \n\nConstruction  related  activities  include  (i)  removal  and  disposal  of  debris,  (ii)  controlling \n18. \nerosion  and  sediment  movement,  runoff  and  storm  water,  (iii)  excavation  of  sites  and \nmanagement  of  spoil  and  stockpiles,  (iv)  storage  and  handling  of  materials  including  fuel  and \nlubricants,  (v)  siting  and  management  of  construction  camps,  (vi)  noise  and  dust  from \nconstruction  activities,  (vii)  worker  and  local  community  health  and  safety,  (viii)  vehicle  and \nmachinery  hazards  to  communities  and  other  road  users,  (ix)  solid  and  liquid  waste \nmanagement,  and  (x)  rehabilitation  and  closing  of  construction  sites.  Re-construction  impacts \nwill  be  short  term  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  by  addressing  the  EMMP  requirements.  The \noverall  responsibility  for  the  completion  of  the  work  and  direction  of  the  contractor  or  labor  to \nmeet the EMMP requirements will be the responsibility of the Project Supervising Engineer (SE) \nwho will be supported by the Environment Management Consultant (EMC). \n\n3. \n\nOperation  \n\n19. \nThe only issue that has been identified for operation is to ensure that the infrastructure is \nnow  adequately  maintained.  Maintenance  will  be  supported  by  an  adequate  budget  allocation \nand the development of awareness within the responsible ministry to undertake this on a timely \nbasis.  Maintenance  will  be  undertaken  by  community  groups  who  could  do  this  under  the \ndirection of local government councils. \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n20. \nThe  Environment  Act  of  1998  defines  the  responsibilities  of  the  Environment  and \nConservation  Division  and  establishes  a  framework  for  environmental  assessment.  The \nprincipal  national  government  agency  charged  with  environmental  policy,  management  and \nmonitoring  responsibilities  is  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation  (DEC)  of  the \nMinistry of Natural Resources. However the capacity for project environmental management is \nbeing built within the MID and particularly in this situation, which is one of emergency relief, the \nSolomon Islands Government will allow the requirements of the IEE to be used as the basis for \nestablishing environmental compliance.  \n\n21. \nIn  the  event  that  a  subproject  design  undergoes  changes  following  the  approval  of  the \nSIEE  and  the  new  design  has  elements  that  impinge  on  the  environmental  impacts  identified \nand  addressed  in  the  original  SIEE/EMMP,  or  introduces  new  potential  environment  impacts, \nthe  SIEE/EMMP  must  be  revised  and  be  subjected  to  reapproval,  to  address  these  new \nimpacts. \n\nThe National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) will be the implementing agency for \n22. \nthe Project. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be created within the NDMO to administer \nand  coordinate  daily  activities  of  the  project.  An  Environment  Management  Consultant  (EMC) \nwill be appointed to the PMU who will report to the PM and will organize the implementation of \nthe EMMP together with the Supervising Engineer (SE).  \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

Further consultations were held with national \nand provincial government officials as well as the communities of the affected areas.  \n\n24. \nPublic  consultation  will  be  an  essential  part  of  the  relief  effort  so  as  to  ensure  that  the \ncommunity  requirements  are  being  addressed  within  the  project  design  and  reconstruction \nactivities. Public consultation will be undertaken by the NDC with support from the PMU so as to \nallow the community to identify with the reconstruction process.  \n\nH. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n\nThe  activities  outlined  in  the  project  are  mainly  clean  up,  repair  and  rehabilitation  of \n25. \ndamaged  infrastructure  along  narrow  infrastructure  corridors.  These  activities  are  expected  to \nhave no significant negative impacts on the environment, and mitigating measures can be put in \nplace.  \n\n26. \nThe  activities  identified  in  the  EMMP  will  allow  damaged  infrastructure  to  be  repaired \nand  reconstructed  providing  it  is  not  located  within  any  environmentally  sensitive  area.  The \nEMMP  provides  realizable  mitigation  measures  that  are  Best  Construction  Practices  and  that \nwill  enhance  the  environmental  sustainability  of  the  relief  operation.  Compliance  monitoring  of \nthe mitigation measures will be the responsibility of the Site Engineer who will be supported in \nthis role by an Environment Management Consultant.  \n\nIt  is  recommended  that  the  project  proceeds  as  planned  and  that  the  mitigating  and \n27. \nmonitoring  measures  that  have  been  identified  within  the  EMMP  are  implemented  during  the \npre-construction,  operation  and  maintenance  phases  of  the  project\u2019s  implementation  by \nincorporation into contracts of services. Based on the IEE findings it is concluded that there are \nno  outstanding  environmental  issues  remaining  and  no  further  environmental  assessment  is \nrequired  for  the  project.  If  any  work  is  required  within  environmentally  sensitive  areas  these \nactivities will need to be assessed according to ADB environmental safeguards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable A9.1: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING PLAN \n\nProposed Mitigation Measure \n\nImplementing \nResponsibility \n\nMitigation \nCost  \n\nParameter \nto \nbe monitored \n\nFrequency \nand  means  of \nVerification  \n\nMonitoring \nresponsibility \n\nMonitoring \n\nCost  \n\nIMPACT MONITORING \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n\ni\n\n \n\na.

Baseline  data  on  the  production  and  prices  of  copra, \ncocoa, and market produce should be collected and updated. \n\n4. \nBaseline  data  on  formal  and  informal  employment,  disaggregated  by  sector  or  activity, \nshould  be  collected  and  updated.  During  and  after  rehabilitation,  data  should  be  kept  on  the \namount of employment created in rehabilitation and regular maintenance. \n\n5. \nIndicators  for  annual  household  income  and  sources  of  income  should  be  developed, \nbaseline  data  collected,  and  updated  annually.  The  percentage  of  poverty  or  hardship  of  the \npopulation or households in the project area also should be estimated. \n\nB. \n\nTransport Sector Performance \n\n6. \nSubproject  feasibility  studies  will  document  the  conditions  of  roads,  and  measure  and \nforecast  a  range  of  technical  performance  indicators  (Table  A10.1).  Appropriate  indicators \nshould be developed for rural conditions, which can be used during feasibility surveys, updated \nafter  rehabilitation,  and  monitored  before  and  after  annual  maintenance.  In  addition,  because \ntransport demand is linked to gross domestic product (GDP), the real annual GDP growth rates \nfor the country (and for the provinces, where available) should be reported with the results.   \n\n \n\nItem \n\nCondition \n\nPerformance \n\nTable A10.1: Transport Sector Performance Indicators \n\nIndicators \n\nRemarks \n\n\u2022  Roughness \n\u2022  Accessibility \n\u2022  Traffic volumes \n\u2022  Traffic growth \n\u2022  Travel times to key destinations \n\n\u2022  Poor/fair/good \n\u2022  All weather/seasonal \n\u2022  AADT \n\u2022  % per year \n\u2022  Average  \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nItem \n\nIndicators \n\nRemarks \n\n\u2022  Vehicle ownership \n\u2022  Frequency of public transport services \n\u2022  Cost of passenger transport services \n\u2022  Cost of freight transport services \n\u2022  Accident rates \n\n\u2022  By vehicle type \n\u2022  Number per day \n\u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Number per year \n\nAADT = average annual daily traffic, SBD \u2013 Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nC. \n\nSocioeconomic Development \n\nIndicators  should  be  developed  on  access  to  social  services,  including  school \n\n7. \nenrollment, visits to health facilities, and visits to government centers. \n\n8. \nIn  addition  to  the  economic  development  indicators  specified  above,  information  on \ngender-specific  impacts  of  the  Project  should  be  developed,  including  increased  employment \nand income for women and youth.  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n9. \nThe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Project  includes  environmental \nmanagement  plans  that  identify  specific  environmental  impacts  that  must  be  monitored  during \nand after rehabilitation.  \n\nE. \n\nRoad Maintenance Inputs \n\nAll road maintenance work, including routine and periodic work carried out by traditional \n10. \nand labor-based equipment supported methods, should be recorded, including (i) nature of the \nwork; (ii) physical quantities of work performed; (iii) cost of the work; (iv) form of execution (by \ndirect labor, small contract, or large contractor); and (v) location and extent of the work.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n65   \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nA. \n\nProject Background \n\n1. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  infrastructure  that  was  damaged  by  the  2  April  2007 \nearthquake  and  tsunami  in  Choiseul  and  Western  provinces,  including  (i)  approximately  35 \nkilometers of rural and town roads, along with about 19 bridges and 35 culverts, (ii) about four \nwharves and one jetty, and (iii) the Gizo town water supply and sanitation system. The Project \nwill be implemented via a sector approach.  \n\n2. \nAll civil works are expected to be conducted on existing facilities within existing rights of \nway,  therefore  they  will  most  likely  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement. \nHowever  it  is  possible  that  construction  clearing  to  original  designs  and  minor  realignments \nnecessitated by disaster damage could cause resettlement impacts. Therefore, this framework \nprovides  a  screening  mechanism,  which  will  identify  possible  resettlement  impacts  for  each \nrehabilitation activity before the commencement of civil works, and provides guidelines on how \nto  address  them  if  they  occur.  In  any  case,  the  number  of  potentially  affected  households  is \nsmall  and  within  the  category  of  \u201cinsignificant  resettlement  impacts\u201d  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995).  \n\nIn  the  rare  event  that  an  activity  requires  physical  or  economic  displacement, \n3. \nResettlement  Plans  (RP)  will  be  prepared.  This  Resettlement  Framework  (RF)  outlines  the \nresettlement  policy  principles,  procedures,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  that  if \nresettlement needs are identified, the project Executing Agency (EA) follows the procedures for \ninvoluntary resettlement in compliance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, \nand  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement  (1998), \nand the agreed resettlement framework for the Project.    \n\nB. \n\nLand Tenure and Management \n\n4. \nTraditional  land  and  resource  management  in  Solomon  Islands  is  community  based. \nSome  87  per  cent  of  land  is  under  customary  resource  tenure  and  all  natural  resources  i.e. \nforests,  minerals,  reefs,  and  islets  belong  to  customary  land  owners.1  The  remaining  land, \nincluding  that  of  Gizo  town,  is  considered  \u201calienated\u201d  and  is  subject  to  registration  under  the \nLand  and  Titles  Act  1988.  The  Act  covers  customary  land  rights  which  includes  land  owned, \nused or occupied by a person or community in accordance with current customary usage. \n\n5. \nAccess to land and resources is bound in social relationships and expressed as \u201crights\u201d \nto exploit resources. Small kin-ship based groups living in villages manage their own resources \nand exercise the right to exploit them. The clan or kin group, known as a \u2018line\u2019, is made up of \n\u201cprimary right holders\u201d - the leaders of the clan or group - who collectively have the authority to \nallocate  use  rights  through  the  spokesman  of  the  line.  The  rest  of  the  line  holds  \u201csecondary\u201d \nrights. Such rights may be inherited or gained through marriage to a primary rights holder.  The \ntransfer  of  rights  differ  with  custom  from  island  to  island,  some  islands  (Guadalcanal,  Central \nand  Western  provinces)  typically  practice  matrilineal  inheritance  and  the  remaining  provinces \npractice patrilineal inheritance.2 \n\n                                                 \n1   Exemptions being the lands of the federal capital area (Honiara) and provincial headquarters. \n2   A  small  area  on  Guadalcanal  \u2013  Marau  \u2013  practices  patrilineal  inheritance  due  to  influence  of  customs  of  Malaita \n\nthrough Malaitans which have relocated to Guadalcanal. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nAcquisition of customary land is usually only undertaken for non-public works such as \n6. \ngold  mines,  oil  palm  plantations,  or  hotels.  For  public  works  requiring  location  on  customary \nland, MID, Solomon Islands Electricity Authority, and Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) \ntypically consult with the members of a line and any other person who claims an interest in the \nland.  For  public  works  the  land  is  not  acquired as  such,  it is  gifted  or  contributed  following  an \nextensive  period  of  consultation  and  agreement  through  signing  of  a  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding (MOU). The MOU waives the customary interest in the land in lieu of the public \ninfrastructure (wharves, roads, schools, clinics and other public utilities). \n\nA recent exception is the land set aside for the Koguli Reservoir in Honiara, which has \n7. \nbeen  leased  by  SIWA  from  the  customary  land  owners.  Other  exceptions  are  projects  funded \nthrough international aid assistance where the donor agency has insisted on registration of the \nland, which in effect alienates the land from customary ownership and must go through both a \ncustomary  process  for  identifying  those  with  an  interest  in  the  land  as  well  as  the  process \nestablished in the Land and Titles Act. This process involves: \n\n\u2022  Commissioner of Lands or Provincial Secretary appointing an Acquisition Officer; \n\n\u2022  The  Acquisition  Officer,  who  has  the  power  of  a  Magistrate,  after  a  series  of \nmeetings  and  hearings,  identifies  a  group  of  trustees  (of  between  two  and  five \npeople) who will represent the line in the acquisition process; \n\n\u2022  A  notice  is  published  specifying  the  date  of  the  next  hearing  and  listing  the  people \n\ninitially identified as trustees; \n\n\u2022  Following  the  hearing,  a  second  notice  is  published  and  posted  in  public  places \nnominating the trustees. The notification process is three months during which time \nappeals as to the nomination of trustees can be made; \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf there is an appeal, adjudication can be a two step process (as described in Item C. \nbelow); \n\nIf there are  no appeals as to the trustees, the area is surveyed and a  Land Officer \nprepares  a  valuation  report  and  certificate.  Discussions  are  held  with  the  trustees \nabout  whether  the  transaction  will  be  through  lease  arrangements  or  complete \nacquisition, as well as initial discussions about the price; \n\n\u2022  Final negotiations are held with the trustees based on the valuation report and their \n\nown determination of the price for the land; \n\n\u2022  According to the Act, agreement to the compensation award must be obtained from \n\nthe \u201cmajority\u201d of persons with an interest in the land; and \n\n\u2022  Following agreement on the price the payment is made, a one-off payment (known \nas the premium) for acquired land or a premium plus rent for leased land.  The Lands \nand  Titles  Act  specified  the  term  of  a  lease  as  33  years  unless  an  alternative \nagreement is reached. \n\n\u2022  Acquisition  of  alienated  land  follows  the  procedure  for  acquiring  alienated  or \nregistered land established in the Land and Titles Act. The process is more straight-\nforward  than  that  of  dealing  with  customary  land.  This  process  is  essentially  a \ntransaction between the Commissioner of Lands, through an Acquisition Officer and \nValuation Officer and the land-owner. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n67   \n\nC. \n\nResolving Disputes over Land Ownership \n\n8. \nAny  disputes  arising  over  alienated  land,  usually  in  relation  to  compensation  as \nownership is clear, are referred to the Magistrates Court and follow the procedure set out in the \nLand and Titles Act and civil code. \n\n9. \nthrough the Magistrates Court, and (ii) the customary procedure. \n\nFor  disputes  over  customary  land,  there  is  a  two-step  process;  (i)  the  civil  procedure \n\nThe hearing in the Magistrates Court will determine whether the case can be dealt with \n10. \nthrough civil proceedings or whether the case is better handled through the customary process. \n\n11. \nThe  customary  process  starts  with  Chief  Hearings,  proceeds  to  the  Local  Court  if  not \nsettled, and if still not resolved after is presented as a case before the Customary Land Appeal \nCourt (CLAC), which usually settles the case.  In the event that the appellant is not satisfied with \nthe ruling of the CLAC, appeals may be brought before the High Court but only on points of law \nrather than disputes about ownership.  In some cases the CLAC will refer the case back to the \nChief  Hearings  where  the  CLAC  is  of  the  view  that  the  Chiefs  can  adequately  determine \ngenealogy and therefore ownership of, or interest in, the land under dispute. \n\nD. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n12. \nAs  noted  above  the  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  or \ndevelopment purposes is the Land and Titles Act. Sections 71 through 85 of the Act deal with \nland acquisition for public purposes and sections 184 through 190 set out the requirements for \npublic rights-of-way. \n\n13. \nThe  legislation  does  not  cover  project-affected  people  without  titles  or  ownership \nrecords,  such  as  informal  settlers/squatters  (non-titled  APs),  while  they  are  covered  under \nADB\u2019s policy.   \n\n14. \nThe Act provides for compensation to be paid (i) in the form of rental for any land used \nor occupied on a temporary basis or (ii) for permanent acquisition of the land.  Compensation is \nassessed on such things as the condition of the land, use of the land and impact on the value of \ncontiguous  land,  and  while  the  Act  includes  a  provision  for  interest  to  be  paid  it  is  not  free  of \ntaxes or other deductions and does not necessarily constitute market or replacement value, as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s policy.  \n\n15. \nFurthermore,  the  legislation  does  not  take  account  of  the  social  and  economic \nconsequence in terms of restoration of livelihoods and incomes. Thus, owing to the absence of \na  policy  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  poverty  reduction,  the \nprovisions  in  this  project-specific  RF  will  be  adopted.  The  RF  and  resettlement  procedural \nguideline stipulations contained in this document will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved under the Project. \n\n16. \nThe RF reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws/regulations and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement and guidelines. It stipulates eligibility and provisions for compensating \nall  types  of  losses  (land,  crops/trees,  structures,  business/employment,  workdays/wages  and \naccess  to  assets).  All  affected  people  (APs)  and  households,  including  non-titled  or  informal \ndwellers,  will  be  compensated  for  lost  assets  (crops,  structures,  trees)  and  will  receive  (i) \ncompensation at replacement value in cash or kind , and (ii) other resettlement assistance such \nas  shifting  allowance,  assistance  to  rebuild  structures  and  compensation  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income  due  to  dislocation.  Lost  livelihoods  and  incomes  will  be  replaced  by  new \nincomes sources and livelihoods, which ensure that the living conditions of the affected people \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nare equal or higher the pre-project levels. Titled APs will receive compensation for land acquired \nby the project at replacement cost, this will be in cash at replacement value or land-for-land (of \nequal size and/or productive value and be satisfactory to the AP). Non-titled APs are not eligible \nfor compensation for land but will receive compensation for assets attached to land and other \nassistance as required (especially in the case of poor or vulnerable APs) and will be assisted to \nhave  a  legal  and  affordable  access  to  land  (through  leasing  agreements  etc.).  Households \nheaded  by  women  and  other  vulnerable  households  such  as  those  with  handicapped  and \nelderly  people  will  be  eligible  for  further  assistance  to  fully  mitigate  project  impacts.

\n\nIncluded  in  the  consultation  process  and  given  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the \nselection of technically and economically feasible alternatives; and \n\n\u2022  Provided with prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses \nof land, assets and access to assets and livelihoods attributable to the subproject(s). \n\nOn the basis of the screening, the EA proposes which of the following option should be \n\n18. \nput in place: \n\n\u2022  an  option  assessment  of  alternative  subproject  designs  in  view  to  avoid  and/or \n\nreduce displacement risks; \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe  elaboration  of  an  RP  to  address  all  resettlement  risks  (see  draft  terms  of \nreference in Annex C); \n\n\u2022  For projects not anticipated to result in displacement, and where loss of assets are \nanticipated  to  be  negligible,  then  this  information  shall  also  be  indicated  in  the \nsubproject application form along with a request to waive the requirement for a RP.  \n\n19. \nThe screening process is described in annex A. It is based on the screening checklist \n(Annex  B),  which  will  be  completed  by  the  PMCBU.  The  screening  form  will  be  approved  by \nADB, which will advise whether an additional assessment should be done to avoid or reduce the \nphysical or economic displacement or whether the argument of the subproject proposal provides \nsufficient evidence for the decision proposed and confirm the best course of action. \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nF. \n\nProcedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n\n20. \nIf the screening identifies possible resettlement impacts, a Resettlement Plan (RP) will \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the \nHandbook on Resettlement (1998) and in close collaboration with those affected. The RP must \ncomply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard policies (such \nas  its  policy  on  indigenous  peoples)  and  establish  a  safety  net  mechanism  and  assist  in  the \nidentification of appropriate livelihood restoration measures. Detailed terms of reference (based \non the draft in Annex C), approved by ADB, will be given to the consultants to ensure that RPs \nmeet  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  RPs  will  be  reviewed  by  the  EA  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview and approval. \n\n21. \nIf  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified,  and  these  impacts  are  likely  to  be \nsignificant,  then  either  a  specific  action  will  need  to  be  included  in  the  RP  or  a  stand-alone \nindigenous peoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  must  be  prepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998).  In the event that an IPDP is required detailed TOR, approved by \nADB, will be given to the consultants to ensure that the IPDP meets ADB\u2019s policy requirements. \nThe IPDP will be reviewed by the EA and submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n\n22. \nFor subprojects, the EAs will carry out social impact assessment surveys (census and \n20%  socioeconomic  survey  of  those  affected),  based  on  preliminary  technical  designs.  An \ninventory of losses (IOL) will be completed for all APs losing land or assets to the Project.  The \nRP will also include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of \nwomen  are  identified,  and  to  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  does  not \ndisadvantage women. Consultants preparing the RPs must be familiar with ADB\u2019s requirements \nand have a track record of preparing satisfactory RPs. \n\n23. \nThe  RP  will  include  a  budget  for  RP  implementation  identifying  where  the  funds  will \ncome from and an implementation schedule linked with the civil works. Construction civil works \nwill  not  commence  until  compensation  has  been  paid  to  APs  (see  paragraph  24  below). \nCompensation will be determined based on published rates from relevant government agencies \n(as set out in Item G) with additional grants as required to ensure compensation at replacement \nvalue  and livelihood restoration. \n\nG. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n24. \nThe  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development,  as  EA  of  the  Project,  will  implement  any \nrequired  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program  with  the  assistance  of  the  Project \nManagement and Capacity Building Unit (PMCBU) for the Project. The EA will undertake a land \nacquisition  survey,  census,  and  the  IOL  survey,  and  prepare  the  RP  and  proposals  for  land \nacquisition  with  the  help  of  a  qualified  social  scientist.  During  the  process,  the  EA  will  ensure \nthat entitlements and mitigation measures are established in the RP consistent with this RF; and \nsuitable budgetary provisions are made for timely RP implementation. The EA will also ensure \nthat the RP is submitted to ADB for approval, and that funds for entitlements under the RP are \nfully provided by the Government to people affected prior to the award of the civil work contract \nand  before  acquiring  any  land,  changing  land  use  patterns  or  restricting  people\u2019s  access  to \ncommon land for the purposes of the Project. \n\n25. \nDepending  on  the  nature  of  assets  to  be  acquired  other  government  agencies  will  be \ninvolved in establishing compensation rates.  Based on scheduled rates the replacement value \nwill be determined in consultation and negotiation especially in respect of assets on customary \nland. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n71   \n\nFor removal of crops and trees, compensation will be based on the published schedules \n26. \nof  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (Agricultural  Extension  Division)  for  root  crops  and  tree  crops  and \nMinistry of Forests, Environment and Conservation (Forestry Division\u2014Commercial Section) for \nplantation trees and wood/timber trees. The rates for root crops are based on value of product \nper m2 and tree crops are valued according to age, size and productivity of individual trees.  The \ncrop rate schedule has recently been updated but has not been gazetted as yet. The rates for \ntimber  or  wood  trees  are  based  on  size  and  grade  (quality)  of  logs  per  m3.  The  August  2006 \nschedule was updated in April 2007. \n\nStructures  (houses  and  commercial  structures)  are  valued  through  the  Ministry  of \n27. \nLands,  Housing  and  Survey  (Housing  Division).  Government  or  state  buildings  are  valued \naccording to condition and vary from $700/m2 for poor condition buildings to $2,800/m2 for good \ncondition buildings. Private buildings are valued at replacement rate plus relocation expenses. \n\n28. \nLand is also valued through Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey (Commissioner of \nLands).    A  valuation  report  is  prepared  based  on  the  size  and  condition  of  land  and  closest \ncomparable values that are obtainable. This can be difficult in respect of customary land or land \nlocated on remote islands as there is little exchange of land and often the closest value land can \nbe \u201crated\u201d land which is urban or township land.  The negotiation process to arrive at an agreed \nprice for customary land can be lengthy. Alienated land is easier to value because it is has been \nregistered and effectively exists within a functioning real estate market. \n\n29. \nAll  scheduled  rates  should  be  verified  through  a  market  appraisal  undertaken  by \nPMCBU which will undertake a brief survey of market rates and comparison with the scheduled \nrates.  Additional  grants  may  be  needed  to  \u201ctop-up\u201d  the  rates  of  some  assets  where  the \npublished rates do not reflect market or replacement value. \n\nH. \n\nConsultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\nThe RPs will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with affected persons \n30. \nand communities. The PMCBU will consult affected households, leaders, and representatives of \ncommunity  associations  to  ascertain  their  needs  and  concerns  about  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  PMCBU  will  inform  affected  people  of  their  entitlements  through  public \nconsultations.  A resettlement booklet containing the entitlement matrix, measurement of losses, \ndetailed  asset  valuations,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments  and  displacement \nschedules will be distributed to the affected people and read in pigin or any other local language \nto those, who have problems to read English, while the RPs will be made available for further \nreference  in  public  places  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Project.  The  EA  will  ensure  the  participation  of \nAPs in the implementation of the RP, and consultation will be detailed in the RP.  \n\n31. \nThe PMCBU will establish an independent grievance redress mechanism to receive and \naddress  concerns  that  are  raised  by  affected  persons  and  provide  for  recourses  to  resolve \ndisputes  in  an  impartial  manner.  Through  public  consultations,  those  affected  will  be  informed \nthat  they  have  a  right  to  grievance  resolution  and  where  they  can  voice  them.  Other  than \ndisputes  relating  to  land  ownership  rights  under  the  appropriate  court  of  law,  grievance \nprocedures  will  address  all  resettlement  benefits,  relocation,  and  other  assistance.  It  will  be \nimportant  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  reflects  the  existing  process  for  resolving  land \ndisputes,  especially  in  respect  of  customary  land.  Beside  this  grievance  redress  mechanism \ndirectly related to the project, people who are directly, materially and adversely affected by ADB \noperations  during  formulation,  processing,  or  implementation  can  also  file  a  complaint  under \nADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism. According to ADB\u2019s Communication Policy the approved RP \nwill be uploaded to ADB\u2019s website and disclosed to the affected people.   \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n32. \nThe  RP  will  contain  a  monitoring  framework  and  the  EA  will  establish  a  monitoring \nsystem  within  the  PMCBU  to  monitor  reconstruction  and  livelihood  restoration  of  all  affected \npersons  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  PMCBU  will  monitor  the  progress  of  all  aspects  of \nresettlement and land acquisition, if any. It will particularly monitor the delivery of resettlement \nentitlements  to  displaced  and  affected  households.  The  PMCBU  will  involve  leaders  and \nrepresentatives of community associations to monitor the programs. The PMCBU will submit a \nquarterly review on resettlement and land acquisition through EA to ADB for review. ADB review \nmissions will specifically check the progress of resettlement and land acquisition programs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nAnnex A: Decision Tree for Sub-project Preparation and Approval \n\nADB: APPROVE, \nIdentify monitoring \nrequirements \n\nRefer to Form 2: Project Report Form \n\nRefer to Chapters 7 and 8 \n\n3.
