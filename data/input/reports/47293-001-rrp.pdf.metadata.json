The  government\u2019s \nstructural reform priorities are set out in its Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 \nand  also  it\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  The  strategy  identifies  three \nstrategic  priorities:  (i)  improved  market  institutions  and  administrative  reforms  for  a  more \ncompetitive  and  equitable  business  environment,  (ii)  development  of  human  resources  and \ninvestment in science and technology, and (iii) improved infrastructure. Under the first strategic \npriority,  the  government  is  focusing  structural  reforms  in  three  areas:  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs), the banking sector, and public investment management. \n  \n3. \nSupport  under  this  program  aligns  to  a  subset  of  the  government\u2019s  broad  structural \nreform  program  through  collaboration  with  other  development  partners.  The  World  Bank \nprovided  support  through  the  Economic  Management  Competitiveness  Credit  (EMCC) \ndevelopment  policy  operation  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  also  provided \nsupport.2 The EMCC consists of a programmatic series of three policy-based operations (EMCC \n1\u20133)  implemented  during  2013\u20132015.  The  program  is  based  on  a  common  policy  matrix  with \nEMCC-2 (Appendix 4).3 The program aims to enhance competitiveness through reform efforts in \nsix  policy  areas:  (i)  banking  sector,  (ii) fiscal  policy,  (iii) public  sector  administration  and \naccountability,  (iv)  state  enterprise  management,  (v)  public  investment  management,  and  (vi) \nbusiness  environment.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  did  not  provide  collaborative \ncofinancing  to  the  approved  EMCC-1, 4  but  supported  government  reforms  through  closely \naligned  program  loans. 5 ADB  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  during  EMCC-3 \nsubject  to  continued  reform  progress.  EMCC-3  will  focus  on  actual  implementation  of  policy \nactions under EMCC-2.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nLosing  competitiveness.  Cross-country  assessments  show  Viet  Nam  is  losing \ncompetitiveness  relative to  other  countries.  Viet  Nam\u2019s ranking  of  70th  out  of  148  countries  in \nthe 2013\u20132014 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index is one notch down from \n2006\u20132007. During this period, Indonesia has moved up by 19 places and Cambodia by 23. Viet \nNam\u2019s  ranking  in  the  Doing  Business  survey  has  fallen  from  90th  in  2011  to  99th  in  2014. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Government  of  Canada  (Can$6  million)  and  the  Government  of  Switzerland  (SwF8  million)  provided \ncofinancing through the EMCC framework. The World Bank administered technical assistance funds provided by \nthe Department for International Development of the United Kingdom ($225,000) and the Government of Australia \n($150,000) for analytical work and capacity building activities.  \n\n3   World Bank. 2014.

Manila. \n\n\fReduced  competitiveness  is  hurting  private  investment  and  slowing  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) growth. \n \n5. \nMore  vigorous  competition  needed  to  boost  private  investment  and  growth.  The \nyear 1986 marked a shift in policy away from central planning and toward a mixed economy\u2014\ntermed  a  \u201csocialist  market  economy.\u201d  Subsequently,  during  1990\u20132007  private  investment \naccelerated,  the  economy  grew  at  an  annual  average rate  of  more  than  7.0%,  and  per  capita \nincome almost quintupled.  However,  this growth trajectory  ultimately  has limited  potential,  and \ngrowth  has  been  increasingly  based  on  factor  accumulation  and  not  productivity. 6 Domestic \nprivate investment as a ratio of GDP has declined from an average of 15.0% in 2007\u20132010 to \naround  11.5%  in  2013.  During  2009\u20132012,  43  out  of  the  63  provinces  saw  a  decline  in  their \nprovincial  competitiveness  index. 7  Far  fewer  private  firms  reported  higher  investments  or \nintentions  to  expand  production.  To  avoid  the  middle-income  trap,  Viet  Nam  will  need  to \nupgrade existing competitiveness fundamentals. \n \n6. \nfollowing similar constraints on competitiveness and sustained economic growth:8  \n \n\nConstraints  on  competitiveness.  Various  country  diagnostics  have  identified  the \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nloans \n\nfinance  sector  has  expanded  quickly  but \n\nWorkforce skill levels remain modest.  \nThe \nremains  shallow  and \nrisen  because  of \nunsophisticated.  Nonperforming \nshortcomings  in  risk  management  at  banks  and  weaknesses  in  the  regulatory \nand supervisory framework.  \nFiscal policy is hampered by the high structural deficits in the government sector. \nPublic investment is inefficient and crowding out private investment.  \nUnequal  treatment  exists  in  the  enterprise  sector,  where  SOEs  and  well-\nconnected private firms have preferential access to land, credit, and public sector \ncontracts.  \n\n(NPLs)  have \n\n(v)  Weak  public  administrative  capacity  and  unclear  business \n\nregulatory \nenvironment  are  obstacles  to  more  vigorous  market  competition.  Corruption \nremains pervasive. \n\n \nHigh-level  political  commitment  for  priority  reforms to boost  competitiveness. To \n7. \nhelp steer reform efforts to boost competitiveness, in May 2012 the prime minister established a \nnational council on sustainable development and competitiveness capacity enhancement, which \nis chaired by a deputy prime minister and has government-wide membership.  \n \n8. \nADB  support  for  the  government\u2019s  reform  agenda. ADB supports the government\u2019s \nreform  agenda  both  through  this  program  as  well  as  other  closely  aligned  policy-based  loans. \nDuring  the  first  phase  of  the  government\u2019s  program,  the World  Bank\u2019s  EMCC-1  aligned  to  the \noverarching policy frameworks of a broad reform agenda. During this initial phase, ADB did not \nenter  into  collaborative  cofinancing  arrangements  with  the  World  Bank  but  instead  supported \nthe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  through  closely  aligned  interventions  such  as  program  loans \nfor  finance  sector  development  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  development. \nThe EMCC-2 operation is more narrowly focused, mainly on banking and SOE reforms.

Legatum Institute. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthe  current  phase  of  the  government\u2019s  program,  ADB  and  the World  Bank  are  entering  into  a \ncollaborative cofinancing agreement to allow for more efficient donor coordination. In particular, \nthe  reform  agenda  integrated  in  EMCC-2  is  strategically  important  and  complements  ADB\u2019s \nongoing  policy  reform  programs,  as  well  as  the  pilot  SOE  restructuring  program. 9  It  also \nprovides  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  remain  engaged  in  business  environment  reforms  after \ncompletion  of  the  SME  development  program  in  2013.  ADB  will  support  the  government\u2019s \nreform agenda during EMCC-3 subject to continued reform progress. \n \nCollaboration  with  other  development  partners.  The  EMCC  program  policy  matrix \n9. \nwas designed jointly by the World Bank; ADB; the Japan International Cooperation Agency; the \ngovernments  of  Switzerland,  Canada,  and  Australia;  and  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom.  ADB  actively  participated  during  the  program  design \nphase,  including  stakeholder  consultations  on  proposed  objectives  and  areas  of  focus  for  the \nEMCC.  ADB  contributed  across  all  reform  areas  but  more  so  through  areas  of  comparative \nadvantage,  especially  SOE  and  procurement  reforms.  ADB  contributions  include  (i)  direct \nengagement  in  policy  dialogue;  (ii)  provision  of  technical  comments  on  draft  laws  and \nregulations; (iii) diagnostics, particularly extraction from operational knowledge; and (iv) capacity \nbuilding activities.10 \n \n10. \nBenefits of the joint donor programmatic approach. This program is aligned with the \n\u201cenhancing  economic  efficiency\u201d  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015.11 It \nprovides  a  common  platform  for  development  partners  to  engage  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment.  It  enables  better  alignment  of  donor  programs  to  government  priorities  and,  as  a \nresult,  leverages  more  resources  for  the  country.  Coordination  is  improved  and  transaction \ncosts are reduced. ADB can also leverage support for its own policy-based loans in the finance \nand corporate sectors, while remaining engaged in other related policy reforms. \n \n11. \nLessons from earlier joint development partner policy-based operations. ADB has \nparticipated  in  joint  development  partner  programmatic  budget  support  in  Viet  Nam  since \n2003.12 A  joint  development  partner  evaluation  suggested  future  policy-based  lending    should \nbe more focused on a few important crosscutting issues, strengthen analytical underpinning of \nselected policy actions, and improve monitoring and communication of program impact.13 ADB\u2019s \nown  evaluation  is  in  line  with  this  assessment.14 Consequently,  the  design  of  this  program  is \nmore  narrowly  focused,  and  has  dedicated  technical  assistance  funds  for  analytical  and \nadvisory support, as well as increased outreach to communicate results of the program. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the program will be increased private investment. The outcome will be the \n\n12. \nimproved competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy. \n \n\n                                                \n9   Mapping  of  Support  for  Financial  Sector  Reforms;  Mapping  of  Support  for  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reforms \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10  Mapping  of  Support  for  Economic  Management  Competitiveness  Credit  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n11 ADB. 2012.

Manila.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nProgram  outputs  align  to  the  six  EMCC  reform  areas.  The  program  includes  11  policy \nactions  identical  to  those  under  the  EMCC-2.  These  policy  actions  were  completed  between \nMay 2013 and June 2014. The program also considered two crosscutting themes: the poverty \nand  social  impact  of  selected  reforms,  and  promoting  greater  data  and  policy-making \ntransparency.  \n \nEnhanced banking sector stability (reform area 1). Enhanced banking sector stability \n14. \nrequires  that  weak  banks  are  restructured,  policies  for  dealing  with  systemic  risks  including \nNPLs are prioritized, and banking supervision is improved. \n \nThe program supports implementation of the government\u2019s credit institution restructuring \n15. \nplan.  This  includes  relaxation  of  requirements  on  foreign  investors  by  the  State  Bank  of  Viet \nNam  (SBV),  encouraging  more  foreign  participation  in  domestic  banks  as  a  way  to  meet \nbanking sector recapitalization needs. During May 2013 the SBV also adopted a comprehensive \npolicy  framework  to  address  the  banking  sector  NPL  problem.  A  significant  element  was  the \nsetting up of the Viet Nam Asset Management Company (VAMC), responsible for the purchase, \nrecovery,  and restructuring  of  bad  debt.  By  2013,  the  VAMC  had  purchased  the  equivalent  of \n$1.9  billion  in  bad  debts  from  35  banks  (estimated  at  1.1%  of  all  outstanding  loans).  If \nadequately resourced and effectively supervised by the SBV, the VAMC could play an important \nrole in overall NPL resolution.  \n \n16. \nADB  supported  a  gap  assessment  between  Viet  Nam  and  international  accounting \nstandards  to  strengthen  regulations  on  asset  classification  and  loan  provisioning  (circular  2). \nThe extent to which the VAMC is able to deal with bad debts will hinge on the implementation of \nmore  challenging  aspects  of  the  circular,  such  as  adjustment  of  loan  classifications  based  on \ncredit information center data. \n \n17.  Maintained  fiscal  policy  (reform  area  2).  More fiscal transparency  and  discipline  are \nneeded  to  balance  government  revenues  and  expenditures  in  a  way  that  is  consistent  with  a \nlong-term budget constraint of the public sector.  \n \n18. \nIn  May  2013  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  approved  the  medium-term  debt \nmanagement program, 2013\u20132015 that set medium-term targets across its entire debt portfolio. \nThe  government  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  better  monitor  and  report  on  prudential  debt \nthresholds,  including  publication  for  the  first  time  of  consolidated  information  on  both  external \nand  domestic  government  debt.  The  government  also  implemented  treasury  single  account \nprocedures  in  two  commercial  banks.  The  implementation  of  such  procedures  is  important \nbecause current cash management arrangements result in borrowing costs that are higher than \nnecessary. \n \n19. \nadministration  and  accountability  require \nadministrative procedures.  \n \n20. \nThe  program  supports  legislation  to  regulate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the \nAmended  Law  on  Anti-Corruption,  2012,  including  increased  transparency,  income  and  asset \ndeclaration  of  public  officials,  and  accountability  of  public  agencies  and  officials.  Decree  59 \nclarifies what constitutes acts of corruption and the process for checks and inspections. It also \ndetails procedures for suspension or transfer of officials suspected in corruption cases. Decree \n\nImproved public administration and accountability (reform area 3). Improved public \ntransparency  and  simplified  public \nimproved \n\n \n\n\f78  provides  more  details  on  who  is  required  to  file  declarations,  what  types  of  assets  and \nincomes  need  to  be  declared,  and  when  to  file  the  asset  and  income  declarations.  One \nimportant  aspect  in  the  decree  is  the  detailed  process  guiding  the  verification  of  asset  and \nincome  declarations.  Another  notable  development  is  the  requirement  to  disclose  the \ndeclarations  at  the  officials\u2019  offices  or  annual  meetings  of  public  agencies.  Decree  90  is  on \naccountability of public agencies and officials to provide better access to information for citizens. \nIt  has  a  detailed  process  on  how  individuals  or  organizations  can  request  accountability  or \ninformation, and how public agencies should respond to such requests. \n \n21. \nStrengthened  state  enterprise  management  (reform  area  4).  Strengthened  SOE \nmanagement requires successful restructuring of large SOEs, better corporate governance, and \nimproved regulatory environment for SOEs.  \n \n22. \nThe  program  supports  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  SOE  reform  agenda  that \ncontains three broad elements: (i) regulatory environment for SOE restructuring (e.g. divestiture \nof state shareholding, restructuring of bad debts); (ii) the adoption and implementation of plans \nand  targets  for  actual  restructuring  of  SOEs;  and  (iii)  corporate  governance  reforms  of  state \neconomic groups (SEGs) and general corporations.15 \n \n23. \nThe government has issued decisions on restructuring SEGs, which commit all SEGs to \ndivest  five  high-risk  noncore  activities  (banking,  insurance,  real  estate,  securities  trading,  and \ninvestment funds) by 2015.16 ADB has supported the pilot restructuring of selected SOEs in the \nconstruction,  logistics,  and  textile  sectors. 17  ADB  is  therefore  in  a  unique  position  to  feed \nlessons  from  the  experience  of  restructuring  several  SEGs  into  the  program  design.  These \noperations have highlighted several legal impediments that obstruct  successful restructuring of \nSOEs into commercially competitive enterprises. The MOF with ADB support has developed an \nSOE  reform  plan  with  timelines  to  guide  the  sequencing  of  necessary  legal  reforms  and \ncoordination  among  government  agencies  and  is  working  toward  resolving  some  legal \nimpediments to SOE  restructuring. These  include  Decree 71/2013/ND-CP  issued in July  2013 \nallowing SOEs to sell assets below book value.  \n \n24. \nBy the end of June 2014, the government had approved restructuring plans for over 60% \nof  SEGs  and  general  corporations.  Many  were  however  based  on  limited  financial  and \noperational analysis. ADB is therefore providing technical assistance (processed separately and \nalready  approved)  to  carry  out  due  diligence  on  restructuring  plans  of  those  SEGs  and  to \nsupport its implementation under its pilot restructuring program. ADB is also providing capacity \nbuilding  support  to  the  management  of  pilot  SEGs  being  restructured,  including  on  internal \naudit, corporate governance, and enterprise risk management. These skills are lacking because \nthe operating focus of enterprise management has been on preserving the value of state capital \nrather than increasing its value.  \n \n\n                                                \n15 During  the  early  2000s,  the  government  concurrently  consolidated  some  SOEs  into  larger  entities  (general \ncorporations)  and  established  SEGs  (a  loose  alliance  of  several  SOEs  with  similar  business  interests)  with  the \nintention of creating globally competitive SOEs. By the end of 2013, there were around 100 general corporations \nand SEGs. \n\n16 PM  Decision  320/QD-TTg  dated  8  February  2013,  PM  Decision  1782/QD-TTg  dated  23 November  2012,  PM \nDecision  314/QD-TTg  dated  7  February  2013,  PM  Decision  38/QD-TTg  dated  5  January  2013,  PM  Decision \n753/QD-TTg dated 17 May 2013, PM Decision 2097/QD-TTg dated 28 December 2012, PM Decision 46/QD-TTg \ndated 5 January 2013, and Decree 71/2013/ND-CP dated 11 July 2013 on restructuring of state economic groups. \n17 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Viet Nam: SOE Reform and \n\nCorporate Governance Facilitation Program - PFR 1. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  issued  Decree  61  to  regulate  financial  supervision,  performance \n25. \nassessment, and disclosure of financial information of SOEs. Policy dialogue on this decree has \nbenefited from several ADB analytical papers that draw on pilot SOE restructuring case studies. \nAll  reports  were  prepared  in  response  to  government  requests.  Topics  include  corporate \ngovernance  and  financial  information  disclosure.  These  reports  informed  the  new  Decree  61 \nthat rationalizes and consolidates the existing legislative framework and provides greater clarity \non public disclosure of financial information. Development partners will be looking for evidence \nof  implementation  of  Decree  61,  including  publication  of  key  financial  and  operational \nperformance  of  all  SEGs.  SOE  supervising  and  monitoring  institutions  will  therefore  require \ncapacity  building  to  better  understand  the  principles  of  market-driven  commercial  operations \nand  to  upgrade  their  skills  in  the  oversight  role  of  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  MOF  is \ncurrently developing a monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor reform progress with the \nsupport of ADB. \n \n26. \nEnhanced  public  investment  management  (reform  area  5).  Enhanced  public \ninvestment  management  requires  improved  public  investment  planning,  prioritization  of  capital \nspending, and increased project efficiency.  \n \n27. \nThe government  approved  a medium-term  investment  plan,  2013\u20132015  that  set capital \nexpenditure  priorities.  This  program  included  a  directive  to  accelerate  clearance  of  capital \nexpenditure  arrears.  All  implementing  ministries  and  agencies  have  since  reported  to  the \nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment  and  the  MOF  the  current  status  of  arrears  and  how  they \npropose to handle these.  \n \nImproved  business  environment (reform  area  6). An enabling business environment \n28. \nrequires  simplified  administrative  procedures  and  a  clearer  and  more  transparent  commercial \nregulatory environment that encourages competition.  \n \nIn  2013  the  government  has  taken  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  the  business \n29. \nenvironment. This included the launching of the government\u2019s online business registration portal \nand simplification of administrative procedures across government. \n \nThe  government  and  development  partners  have  been  working  closely  on  public \n30. \nprocurement  reform,  which  has  a  major  impact  on  the  business  environment.  Program  policy \nactions  include  an  Amended  Law  on  Procurement,  2013  to  strengthen  transparency  and \ncompetition  in  public  procurement.  ADB  has  a  large  country  investment  portfolio  and  vast \noperational  knowledge  on  government  procurement  systems.  In  coordination  with  the  World \nBank,  ADB  has  provided  substantial  technical  inputs  on  drafting  of  the  amended  law  and \nsecondary  legislation  related  to  its  implementation.  The  amended  law  contains  significant \nimprovements,  including  (i)  expanded  scope  to  include  public\u2013private  partnerships  and \nexpenditures  by  SOEs,  (ii)  introduction  of  innovative  electronic  systems  that  enhance  the \nefficiency and transparency of the procurement system, (iii) provisions to limit use and abuse of \ndirect contracting, and (iv) the new law implicitly superseding procurement-related provisions in \nother \nthese \nimprovements,  some  deficiencies  remain,  such  as  lack  of  an  independent  bidder  complaint \nmechanism  and  mandatory  requirement  for  foreign  firms  to  associate  with  local  companies. \nADB will examine implementation of the new legislation. \n \nOther program policy actions related to tax reforms. An Amended Law on Value-Added \n31. \nTax (VAT), 2013 includes a lower threshold, allowing a large number of taxpayers to move out \nof the VAT network under the invoice credit method, thereby reducing both tax compliance cost \n\nto  ensure  consistent  application  and  better  enforcement.  Despite \n\nlaws \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nand  tax  administration  costs.  The  government  also  adopted  an  Amended  Law  on  Corporate \nIncome  Tax,  2013  to  establish  competitive  corporate  income  tax  rates,  clarify  rules  and \nregulations on transfer pricing, and introduce provisions on deductible expenses. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nIn 2014, with a budget deficit target of 5.3%, the government will need to borrow D215 \ntrillion  ($10.2  billion).  EMCC-2  collaborative  cofinancing  contributes  about  6%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nbudget deficit financing requirements, and an even higher share of concessional financing to the \nbudget.  ADB  will  provide  $230  million,  contributing  about  36%  of  total  EMCC-2  pledges  by \ndevelopment partners (Table 1).18  \n \nThe government has requested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR60.68 \n33. \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan of $140 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The Special Funds resources loan will have a 25-\nyear  term,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ordinary capital resources \nloan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement procedure for policy-based loans19 based on a negative list.20 \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan) \n     Special Funds resources (loan) \nWorld Bank \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAmount ($ million) \n230.00 \n140.00 \n       90.00 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n36.5 \n22.2 \n14.3 \n39.7 \n250.00                                        \n23.8 \n150.00                         \n100.0 \n630.00 \n\n34. \nThe SBV will be the executing agency. The EMCC has a tiered governance structure. A \nsteering committee is chaired by a deputy prime minister and includes heads of agencies of key \nimplementing  agencies.  The  steering  committee  reviews  and  endorses  the  proposed  areas  of \noperational  focus.  Technical  teams,  represented  by  senior  technocrats  from  key  implementing \nagencies  and  EMCC  development  partners,  help  oversee  the  preparation  of  the  operation, \ndiscuss  the  technical  elements  of  policy  actions,  decide  on  analytical  work,  and  brief  the \nsteering committee. Annually, three technical missions are carried out to appraise and monitor \nprogress  toward  policy  actions.  The  EMCC  includes  a  trust  fund  for  targeted  analytical  and \nadvisory activities to underpin the strategic focus of the EMCC. ADB does not contribute directly \nto the trust fund  but  has  contributed knowledge by  leveraging  off  ongoing operations,  such  as \nlessons learned from SOE restructuring. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 2.  \n                                                \n18 Financing contributions under EMCC-2 include $250 million from the World Bank and $150 million from the Japan \n\nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n\n19 ADB. 1998.

International  credit  rating  agencies  have \nestimated NPLs at 15%\u201330% of total banking system loans. Even on the lower end, this would \nrequire $4 billion of additional capital to absorb the losses embedded in these assets. Structural \nreforms will boost competitiveness by improving efficiency of SOEs and public investment, and \nreduce  crowding  out  of  private  investment.  Enhanced  banking  sector  stability  and  an  improve \nbusiness  environment  will  encourage  entrepreneurship  and  private  investment.  A  recent  debt \nsustainability  analysis  included  a  reform  scenario  whereby  medium-  to  long-term  GDP  growth \nwas 1.0%\u20131.5% of GDP higher than in a scenario with no reforms.21 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n36. \nViet Nam\u2019s public financial management (PFM) environment is considered adequate to \nsupport  this  program. The  2013  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  assessment22 \nassessed that the government has maintained strong ownership of the PFM reform agenda and \ncontinues  to  lead  a  coordinated  reform  program  in  consultation  with  the  donor  community. \nHowever,  while the financial  management  and accountability  systems  of the government  have \nimproved, there remain weaknesses that need to be addressed.

However,  rationalization  of  public \ninvestment  and  potential  SOE  labor  retrenchment  may  result  in  short-term  negative  social \nimpacts.

ADB  has  conducted \nanalytical work on social impacts of SOE restructuring to inform policy developments in this area. \n \nThe  program  has  positive  social  impacts,  including  (i)  simplified  VAT  procedures \n39. \nreducing  transaction  costs  for  enterprises  with  favorable  effects  on  economic  growth  and \nemployment;  (ii)  reduced  corporate  income  tax  applied  to  SMEs  to  reduce  tax  obligations  of \nenterprises,  lessen  potential  layoffs,  and  increase  wages;  (iii)  government  efforts  to  clear \narrears to contractors  in  the  construction  sector where a growing  number  of  workers  have not \nbeen  paid;  and  (iv)  improved  implementation  of  the  Amended  Anti-Corruption  Law,  2012  to \nreduce  transaction  costs  for  enterprises,  especially  SMEs,  and  programs  targeting  poverty \nreduction. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or negatively affect indigenous \n\n40. \npeople or the environment.

The  integrated \nbenefits  and  impacts  of  the  program  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  of  risk  mitigating \nmeasures.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 The overall risk rating is assessed as \nmedium. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \n1.  Public Financial Management \n1.1  Weak oversight of aggregate fiscal risk \n1.2  Lack of budget comprehensiveness \n   \n\nProgram policy actions include (i) improved fiscal \ntransparency and discipline needed to balance government \nrevenues and expenditures in a way that is consistent with a \nlong-term budget constraint of the public sector; (ii) improved \nfinancial reporting of SOEs; and (iii) enhanced public \ninvestment management through improved public investment \nplanning, prioritization of capital spending, and increased \nefficiency of projects. \n\nProgram policy actions include an Amended Law on \nProcurement, 2013 to strengthen transparency and \ncompetition in public procurement. ADB has provided \nsubstantial technical inputs on drafting of the amended law \nand secondary legislation related to its implementation. \n\nThis program supports implementation of the Amended Law \non Anti-Corruption, 2012 including guidelines on increased \ntransparency, income and asset declaration of public \nofficials, and accountability of public agencies and officials. \n\nTo strengthen government ownership and interministerial \ncoordination, EMCC adopts a governance arrangement \nwhereby the overall strategic guidance comes from a \n\n2.
