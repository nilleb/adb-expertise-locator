Investment  in  roads  is\npart  of  a  continuing  program  to  support  the  development  of  an\nintegrated  and  balanced \nthe  country.  The\nimprovement  of  feeder  and  district  roads  to  all-weather  maintainable\nstandard  will  establish  effective  communications  to  serve  major\nagricultural production centers and other socioeconomic facilities. The\nconstruction  of  a  new  district  headquarters  access  road  will  establish\neffective  connections  between  district  communities  and  the  national\nroad  network.  Ensuring  the  EWH  is  in  a  maintainable  condition  is\nthe\nessential \ndevelopment  of  subregional  activities.  Strengthening \ninstitutional\ncapacity for preserving the existing asset base of the road network is\nneeded to improve efficiency in road maintenance.\n\nfor  supporting  domestic \n\ntrade  and  promoting \n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government\nimprove  transport  efficiency  and  thereby  enable  the  country  to\nstimulate  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  leading  to  poverty\nreduction.  The  Project  will  maintain  about  140  kilometers  (km)  of  the\nEWH,  improve  approximately  165  km  of  roads  to  all-weather  paved\nsurface, construct a district headquarters access road of about 96 km\nusing  environment-friendly, \nlabor-based  construction  methods,\ndevelop  and  implement  performance-based  maintenance  on  about\n200-300  km  of  the  network,  and  improve  about  10  km  of  a  cross-\nborder  access  road.  The  Project  will  induce  more  efficient  movement\nof  goods  and  passengers,  provide  better  access  to  income  and\nemployment  opportunities  and  to  education  and  health  centers;\nimprove public sector implementation and maintenance capacity in the\nroad sector; support development of private sector capabilities to carry\nout  road  improvement  and  maintenance  by  contract;  improve  road\nsafety  and  axle-load  control;  and  provide  community  access  and\ncomplementary  facilities  through  a  participatory  approach  leading  to\npoverty reduction.\n\n\fiii\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $69.5  million  equivalent,\nincluding  service  charges  during  construction.

The  poverty  impact  ratios  for\nstrengthening  the  EWH  are  estimated  to  be  0.33  and  improving  terai\nroads  0.55,  well  above  0.20,  which  is  the  poor\u2019s  share  of  national\nincome.\n\n\fv\n\n\fv\n\ni\n\n\fv\n\ni\ni\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Road Network Development Project; and (ii) the proposed\nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for the Project to be provided\nby the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nNepal is a landlocked country with a population of approximately 23.2 million people. It is\none of the poorest countries in the world. In 2000, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was\nless  than  $245,  making  Nepal  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  region.  Several  structural\nfactors  hinder  the  country's  attempts  at  development:  (i)  the  difficult  terrain  of  a  mountainous,\nlandlocked country; (ii) heavy dependence on subsistence agriculture; (iii) low levels of physical\ninfrastructure  and  human  capital;  (iv)  low  domestic  resource  mobilization  and  the  consequent\ndependence  on  international  assistance;  (v)  inadequate  institutional  capacity  for  development\nmanagement; and (vi) lack of good governance.\n\nOfficial  development  assistance \n\n3.\nfrom  bilateral,  multilateral,  and\nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  resources.  The  principal  bilateral  sources  are  Denmark,\nGermany, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Among the multilaterals,\nADB and World Bank are the largest loan providers. The United Nations system is the largest\nmultilateral grant provider.\n\nis  derived \n\n4.\nThe  transportation  system  in  Nepal  depends  heavily  on  the  road  network.  Although\nconsiderable  rehabilitation  has  taken  place,  the  network  must  be  extended  to  provide  the\npopulation  with  access  to  social  services,  trade,  and  employment  opportunities  that  will  allow\nthe  country  to  achieve  acceptable  levels  of  economic  growth.  Much  of  the  existing  network  is\nunpaved and requires upgrading to provide all-weather passage. A large part of the paved road\nnetwork  has  deteriorated,  and  improvement  and  rehabilitation  are  needed  to  bring  it  to  a\nmaintainable  condition.  While  supporting  continuation  of  these  efforts,  ADB  will  increasingly\nfocus  on  maintenance  issues,  as  the  preservation  of  road  assets  is  recognized  as  equally\nimportant in developing the road sector.\n\n5.\nThe  proposed  Project  was  developed  in  response  to  the  Government's  transport\ndevelopment emphasis on expanding the country's transport facilities to ensure more balanced\ndevelopment  throughout  the  country,  and  specifically  to  provide  links  to  districts  currently  not\nserved  by  roads.  The  roads  covered  by  the  Project  lie  in  the  eastern  and  central  parts  of  the\ncountry  and  represent  important  links  that  can  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty\nreduction. The Project will address the important sector issue of promoting the development of\nlocal  private  sector  contractors  capable  of  improving  and  maintaining  roads.  The  Project  will\nalso  assist  the  Government's  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  to  improve  its  capacity  to  manage\nroad maintenance works through a program of performance-based maintenance (PBM).\n\n6.\nThe Project has been formulated on the basis of the findings of the technical assistance\n(TA)  for  the  feasibility  study,1  the  draft  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Paper,2  discussions  with  the\nGovernment and other agencies active in the sector, the findings of the various project missions\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement, for $775,000, approved on 24 December 1997.\n2  ADB. 2001.

Fact-finding\nfor the Project was completed during 19 March - 9 April 2001, and the Appraisal Mission was\ncarried out during 27 June - 11 July 2001.3 The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\n\n2\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nThe Sector\n\n1. \n\nGeneral\n\n7.\nThe  economy  of  the  country  depends  largely  on  the  performance  of  the  rural  sector.\nAgriculture  is  one  of  the  most  important  activities,  accounting  for  41  percent  of  FY2000  gross\ndomestic product and about 76 percent of total employment.4 However, the population living in\nrural areas has a low per capita income, poverty is widespread, and basic physical and social\ninfrastructure is lacking.\n\n8.\nAbout  42  percent  of  the  population  live  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  NRs4,400\n(about  $77)  per  capita  per  annum,  which  is  based  on  minimum  caloric  intake,  housing,  and\nother nonfood standards.5 This figure varies widely across the country. Twenty-three percent of\nthe  urban  population  and  44  percent  of  the  rural  population  do  not  have  sufficient  income  to\nmeet basic consumption needs.\n\n9.\nTaking a broader view of human deprivation than the simple income measure, Nepal is\nranked  144th  of  174  countries  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)'s  2000\nHuman Development Report.6 The people in the poorest regions also have the lowest access to\neducation and basic health service, and highest rates of infant mortality and child malnutrition.\nThe human literacy rate of individuals age 6 and above is 38 percent. However, only 20 percent\nof the poor are literate compared with 60 percent of those in higher-income groups. Poverty also\nheightens gender differences. While 32 percent of poor men are literate, the literacy rate of poor\nwomen is much lower at 9 percent. Poverty induces malnutrition and frequent illnesses forcing\nhouseholds  to  spend  their  precious  resources  on  medical  care.  In  turn,  illiteracy,  malnutrition,\nand disease reduce development and employment opportunities, worsening poverty. The major\nchallenge  facing  Nepal  is  to  overcome  this  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  and  low  human\ndevelopment.\n\nAbsence  of  roads  acts  as  a  significant  bottleneck  to  increasing  productivity  in  the\n10.\nagriculture  sector.  Inputs  cannot  be  delivered  at  the  right  place  and  at  the  right  time  in  the\nabsence of roads. Thus farmers are not able to specialize to take advantage of higher-valued,\nmarketable  niche-type  products.  Productivity-raising  services  and \nto  be\nconcentrated in the more accessible areas, and marketable crops also tend to be grown mainly\nin those areas, leaving the remoter parts to suffer from persistently low productivity and income.\nThus large segments of the population living in areas with no or at best very minimal seasonal\nroad  accessibility  are  poor  in  terms  of  income  and  other  human  development  attributes.  This\n\ninputs \n\ntend \n\n                  \n\n3  The  Mission  comprised  S.  Widowati,  Project  Engineer  and  Mission  Leader;  E.  Brotoisworo,  Senior  Environment\nSpecialist;  P.

Human Development Report.\n\n\f3\n\nlinkage is confirmed by the high correlation between the density of district roads per capita and\nthe  human  development  index  (footnote  6).  Road  transport  generally  provides  the  primary\naccess between different areas of Nepal. It is the only mode of transport for the bulk of goods\nand people, accounting for most passenger transport and nearly all freight transport. As a result,\nthe  social  and  economic  well-being  of  Nepal  is  heavily  dependent  upon  an  effective  and\nsustainable road network.\n\n2. \n\nPlanning, Coordination, and Administration\n\n11.\nThe National Planning Commission sets overall development objectives and coordinates\nthe investment programs of external agencies and individual government agencies. The Ministry\nof  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  has  prime  responsibility  for  planning,  formulating\npolicies, and managing all land transport facilities, including roads and bridges. The Ministry of\nLocal Development is responsible for district roads.\n\n12. Within  MPPW,  DOR  is  responsible  for  network  planning,  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance  of  the  country's  strategic  road  network;  and  municipalities  are  responsible  for\nurban  roads.  The  Department  of  Transport  Management,  within  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and\nTransport  Management,  is  responsible  for  regulating  road  transport,  including  vehicle\nregistration and licensing. The Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural\nRoads, within the Ministry of Local Development, is responsible for coordinating and facilitating\nthe rural infrastructure development process throughout the country and for providing technical\nguidance and support at the local level.\n\nDOR  is  headed  by  a  director  general  who  is  assisted  by  deputy  directors  general  in\n13.\ncharge of DOR's various administrative and technical branches. Administration of ADB-financed\nroad  projects  is  carried  out  by  a  DOR  division,  the  Project  Directorate  (ADB),  headed  by  a\nproject  director  with  the  rank  of  a  gazetted  first  class  officer.7  Currently,  DOR  has  about  300\nengineers, 600 junior engineers, and more than 1,000 technical and administrative support staff.\nDOR's present organization structure is shown in Appendix 2.\n\n14.\nSubstantial efforts have been under way through partnerships between the Government\nand  various  external  funding  agencies,  as  part  of  ongoing  projects,  to  help  DOR  improve  its\nroad  management  capacity,  planning  and  monitoring  capability,  and  environmental  and  traffic\nsafety  practices.  The  results  are  noteworthy,  especially  for  improvements  in  planning  and\nimplementation.  DOR  has  been  able  to  develop  and  improve  its  basic  capabilities  to  better\nmanage  the  road  capital  and  resources  allocated  to  the  sector.  However  additional  support  is\nstill needed in these areas as well as for strengthening DOR\u2019s maintenance capability.\n\n3. \n\nRoad Network\n\n15.\nNepal's transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation, dominated by\nthe  road  subsector,  which  provides  for  the  movement  of  approximately  90  percent  of  all\npassengers  and  freight  within  the  country.  A  key  part  of  Nepal's  road  system  is  the  4,740\nkilometers  (km)  Strategic  Road  Network  (SRN),  which  constitutes  36  percent  of  the  total  road\nnetwork. The SRN, administered by DOR, is formed by the national highways and feeder roads.\nThe  national  highways  consist  of  the  East-West  Highway  (EWH),  which  acts  as  a  backbone\n\n7  In  Nepal,  director  general,  deputy  director  general,  and  superintendent  engineer  fall  under  the  broad  category  of\n\n                  \n\ngazetted first class officer.\n\n\f4\n\nrunning the length of the country in the terai,8 and north-south highways linking major towns that\nserve a large portion of population. The feeder roads are major links to national highways and\nprovide access to the district headquarters and places of national importance such as tourism,\nindustry,  power  generation,  and  pilgrimage  sites.  While  the  strategic  network  is  mostly  all-\nweather,  only  about  two  thirds  is  sealed.  Other  roads  comprise  rural  roads  that  feed  off  the\nstrategic  network  and  urban  roads.  The  rural  roads,  administered  by  the  Department  of  Local\nInfrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads, total about 6,615 km (50 percent) and are\nmostly  earthen  roads  and  tracks.  About  1,870  km  of  urban  roads  (14  percent),  a  mixture  of\nsealed  and  nonsealed  roads,  are  under  municipal  administration.  About  a  third  of  all  urban\nroads  are  within  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  road  network  and  classification  are  detailed  in\nAppendix 3.\n\nDespite  the  many  positive  advances  achieved  in  the  road  network,  Nepal  continues  to\n16.\nlag  behind  its  neighbors  in  road  infrastructure  with  an  estimated  road  network  of  very  low\ndensity\u2014about 90 meters (m) per square km or 660 m per 1,000 population (Appendix 3). Road\ncontact between Kathmandu and many district capitals, 23 of 75 districts, remains problematic.\nAbout two thirds of the road network remains unpaved and much remains impassable during the\nwet  season.  Although  the  upgrading  of  the  EWH  is  nearing  completion,  continued  attention  to\nthe  SRN  remains  essential,  as  parts  of  the  network  are  poorly  maintained  or  approaching  the\nend  of  its  design  life  and  many  district  headquarters  are  not  road-connected  and  need  to  be\nimproved and developed.\n\n17.\nInitiatives that have achieved success in rural (district, local) road development are the\n\"green roads\" funded by Deutsch Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and \"food\nfor  work\"  funded  by  Swiss  Development  Corporation  (SDC).  The  proposed  Rural  Access\nProgramme  funded  by  DFID  will  provide  a  similar  approach.  Using  a  participatory  planning\nprocess,  those  projects  aim  to  improve  access  of  rural  communities  by  better  siting  basic\nfacilities  and  services  for  rural  populations,  and  improving  the  mobility  of  rural  people  through\nlow cost  roads,  tracks, trails, and footbridges. At the same time, those projects have provided\nemployment  opportunity  to  rural  communities.  A  key  theme  in  the  process  is  an  environment-\nfriendly and labor-based construction approach.\n\n4. \n\nTraffic and Vehicle Fleet\n\n18.\nThe  registered  motor  vehicle  fleet  in  1999/2000  comprised  263,516  units:  53,073  cars,\njeeps,  and  vans;  52,534  buses,  trucks,  and  tractors;  and  157,909  motorcycles,  tempos,  and\nothers.  The  average  annual  growth  rate  is  about  13  percent,  with  the  highest  growth  in\nmotorcycles.  An  important  feature  of  road  transport  within  Nepal  is  the  relatively  low  traffic\nvolume. Outside the Kathmandu Valley, the highest volumes are 2,500-3,000 vehicles per day\n(vpd) on the main route to the Indian border. On key links in the terai, volumes are 300-1,000\nvpd,  with  flows  of  100-200  vpd  on  the  main  hill  roads.  Earth  roads  at  the  extremities  of  the\nnetwork  may  have  traffic  volumes  of  less  than  25  vpd.  Except  around  Kathmandu  where  cars\nare common, traffic has been dominated by buses and trucks. Data on the vehicle fleet during\n1989-1999 is shown in Appendix 4.\n\n5. \n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n19.\nBoth  public  and  private  industry  operate  road  transport.  Over  90  percent  of  passenger\ntraffic  is  carried  by  bus.  A  public  bus  company  operates  in  Kathmandu  Valley  but  most\n\n8  Nepal is divided into three geographic regions: the terai (flat plains), middle hills, and mountains.\n\n                  \n\n\f5\n\ninterregional  passenger  traffic  is  carried  by  private  bus  companies  and  operators.  The  road\nfreight transport industry, which carries over 90 percent of freight traffic, is dominated by private\noperators  who  are  mostly  owner-drivers.  Bus  fares  are  partially  regulated  by  Government  and\nfreight rates are determined by market forces.\n\n20.\nHistorically,  bus  and  truck  operations  have  been  controlled  by  operators'  associations.\nMany more buses and trucks are available for hire than needed, and these associations provide\na mechanism for rationing the available work among vehicles. The Government also established\nupper limits for bus fares. However, the operators' associations have not had complete control,\nand  free  market  services  exist  at  lower  prices;  not  all  bus  fares  conform  to  the  Government\nregulations, particularly in hilly areas and along earth roads.\n\nBus  fares  are  clearly  related  to  road  and  terrain  conditions.  If  roads  are  allowed  to\n21.\ndeteriorate, bus fares will likely increase, and conversely, if roads are maintained, fare increases\nare likely to be avoided. While this general relationship exists, in practice neither the official nor\nactual fares seem to be adjusted automatically when roads are improved. Changes in fares may\noccur only over the longer term or where strong competition exists.\n\n22.\nThe general relationships between road condition and freight charges also apply. Freight\nrates reflect the condition of the road and imply rates on the unpaved sections of NRs20-25 per\nton km, compared with around NRs10-12 per ton km on the paved sections. In the Far Western\nRegion,  rates  are  generally  lower  and  show  a  more  marked  difference  between  paved  and\nunpaved sections. These lower rates exist despite a lower volume of back-haul freight and are\nbelieved  to  result  from  freer  competition  compared  with  stronger  control  over  freight  by  truck\nowners' associations in the east. However, the general link between road condition and freight\nrates, which has underpinned the increase in trade volume, is seen in all areas.9\n\n6. \n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures\n\n23.\nGovernment revenues from road users consist mainly of custom duties and sales taxes\non vehicles and spare parts, taxes on fuels, and road toll collection. During 1992/93\u20141998/99,\nrevenues  are  estimated  to  have  increased  from  about  NRs1.35  billion  to  NRs2.66  billion  or\nabout a 15 percent increase per annum. These revenues are not explicitly earmarked for road\nconstruction, improvement, and maintenance. During the same period, annual expenditures on\nall  types  of  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  increased  from  about  NRs858  million  to  NRs2,585\nmillion, accounted for about 58.4 percent and 48.5 percent of total road expenditures. However,\nthe  overall  coverage  of  road  expenditures  (administration,  new  construction,  reconstruction,\nmaintenance,  and  others)  by  road  revenues  was  66.6  percent  in  1998/99  compared  with  92\npercent in 1992/93. Appendix 5 provides more details on these revenues and expenditures.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n24.\nSince the 1970s, the Government's main objective within the road sector has been the\ncompletion  of  the  strategic  network.  With  assistance  from  external  financing  agencies,  the\nGovernment  prepared  the  Priority  Investment  Plan  1997-2006.  The  plan  provides  a  10-year\nexpenditure  plan  for  road  development  and  maintenance,  and  serves  as  the  general  basis  for\nselection  of  road  sector  support  by  ADB  and  other  external  financing  agencies.  The\nGovernment's  Ninth  Plan  (1997-2002)  has  an  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  with  a\n\n9  ADB.  2000.  Impact Evaluation Study of the Asian Development Bank Assistance to the Road Sector in Nepal.\n\n                  \n\nManila.\n\n\f6\n\ntarget of reducing the poverty rate by 10 percentage points by the end of the plan period. The\nplan's  transport  policy  and  implementation  strategy  includes  (i)  repair,  maintenance,  and\nrehabilitation of highways and feeder roads; (ii) low-cost construction of first intervention roads\nto  district  headquarters  now  not  connected  to  the  road  network;  and  (iii)  labor-oriented\nconstruction methods geared to maximize local participation and address the poverty reduction\nobjective.\n\nUnder  the  ongoing  Road  Maintenance  and  Development  Project  (RMDP),10  supported\n25.\nby the International Development Association, a mechanism for earmarking road user revenues\nfor  maintenance  is  being  developed  through  the  enactment  of  a  Nepal  road  board  act  and\nestablishment of a Nepal road board. The Government constituted the Road Management and\nFinance Reform Implementation Committee, which has six members from the private sector and\nfive from government; the committee is to prepare a reform proposal for sustainable financing\nand  improved  management  of  road  maintenance  through  a  road  fund.  The  draft  Road  Board\nBill,  approved  by  the  Cabinet,  is  being  presented  to  the  Parliament  in  the  2001  session.  The\nproposed  road  board,  consisting  of  four  members  from  the  public  sector  and  seven  from  the\nprivate  sector,  will  oversee  road  maintenance  planning  and  policy,  and  the  collection  and\nexpenditure of funds. The draft act stipulates the following possible resources for the fund: (i) a\nfuel  levy  on  diesel  (NRs1.5/liter)  and  petrol  (NRs2.0/liter),  (ii)  road  tolls,  (iii)  a  heavy  vehicle\nlicense  fee,  (iv)  international  transit  fee,  and  (v)  counterpart  funding  of  districts  and\nmunicipalities. The proposed act provides for (i) adjusting road user charges to reflect increased\nmaintenance  needs,  (ii)  collecting  and  depositing  such  charges  directly  into  the  fund,  and  (iii)\nensuring  that  the  fund\u2019s  proceeds  are  used  in  priority  for  road  maintenance.  An  annual  road\nmaintenance  program  (ARMP)  will  be  prepared  annually  by  each  road  agency,  and  the  road\nboard will review and consolidate the programs into a national ARMP. The national ARMP will\nbe executed on a contract basis.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n26.\nThe  development  of  Nepal's  main  roads  has  depended  upon  substantial  foreign\nassistance. Typically, 50-70 percent of the road budget has come from foreign loans and grants.\nSince  1983,  ADB  has  provided  6  loans  totaling  $152.4  million11  for  the  roads  in  Nepal.  The\nWorld  Bank  has  provided  2  loans  totaling  $116.4  million.  Other  aid  agencies,  Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  DFID,  GTZ,  SDC,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and\nIndia,  have  provided  financing  for  15  projects.  External  assistance  for  SRN  development  from\n1976 to 1999 is shown in Appendix 6.\n\n27.\nThe  main  sources  of  assistance  for  roads\u2014ADB,  DFID,  GTZ,  JICA,  SDC  and  World\nBank\u2014have  similar  views  on  the  priorities  and  the  need  for  close  coordination  of  their\nrespective  programs.  A  transport  sector  thematic  assistance  group  of  agencies  funding  roads\nmeets  regularly  in  Kathmandu.  In  general,  the  agencies  consider  road  transport  to  be  an\nimportant  means  of  reducing  poverty,  and  attach  priority  to  developing  the  SRN  by\nimplementing  the  Priority  Investment  Plan,  and  improving  road  maintenance  by  implementing\nthe ARMP being prepared under the RMDP.

Overall, ADB's involvement in the road subsector has been\nsignificant, addressing a large portion of the road upgrading and periodic maintenance needs of\nthe  EWH  as  well  as  hill  roads.  ADB  has  financed  about  one  quarter  of  road  development\nexpenditure in Nepal since the 1980s.\n\n29.\nFollowing early experience with delays and cost overruns due mainly to inflation-related\ncost  increases,  the  performance  of  ADB  projects  has  improved  considerably.  The  Third  Road\nImprovement  Project  (TRIP)  was  completed  on  time  and  on  budget,  however,  because  of  the\nshortage of funds the project was unable to complete links in eastern and far western regions.\nProject  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  have  been  issued  for  all  completed\nprojects.  In  December  2000,  an  impact  evaluation  study  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  road\nsubsector in Nepal was completed. The reports and study reveal that ADB's operations in the\nsubsector have been generally successful, although the projects have often been delayed due\nto  difficult  terrain  and  geographical  conditions,  political  changes,  and  adverse  macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\n30.\nIn the hill areas, improvements to roadside and cross-road drainage included as part of\nthe roadworks have had a positive effect on managing storm-water flow and stabilizing slopes\ndisturbed  by  the  initial  construction.  Some  sections  are  unstable  and  prone  to  slides,  and  off-\nroad  works  in  general  have  assisted  with  the  control  of  these  areas.  The  TRIP  included\nextensive off-road bioengineering works aimed at revegetating and stabilizing slopes disturbed\nby construction. The slope protection manual prepared under the TRIP will be applied under the\nProject. Sufficient physical contingency will also be provided under the Project.\n\n31.\nPolitical  changes  may  delay  project  implementation,  and  adverse  macroeconomic\nconditions may affect the actual costs of implementation resulting in reduced project scope. In\nsome  cases  the  project  scope  reduction  may  produce  lower  economic  internal  rates  of  return\nand  unsatisfactory  achievement  of  development  objectives.  Under  the  Project  these  problems\nare  being  positively  addressed  by  providing  a  sufficient \nimplementation  period  and\ncontingencies.\n\n32.\nThe armed civil disturbance continues to pose a serious peace and security or law and\norder problem for the Government. The movement, concentrating mostly in the Midwestern and\nWestern regions, is escalating into other regions. Violence targeted primarily at the Government\nalso hinders delivery of basic services and private sector activities. The Government has taken\nmeasures, including the possible use of armed police force, to counter the civil disturbances and\nbring  the  deteriorating  security  situation  under  control.  The  Project,  although  located  in  the\nCentral  and  Eastern  regions,  will  promote  consultation  and  public  participation  particularly  to\nincrease  public  awareness  of  the  Project  and  to  address  community  road-related  needs.  This\nmay increase public support for the Project and reduce disruptions during implementation.\n\n33.\nExperience  demonstrates  the  importance  of  advance  procurement  action,  counterpart\nstaff and funds, and community participation. The Project will allow advance action for selecting\nconsultants for detailed design and construction supervision. The issues of counterpart staff and\nfunds are addressed in the project assurances. DOR and ADB have learned from the TRIP that\n\n\f8\n\na  more  active  community  consultation  component  is  needed  for  the  road  design  and\nimplementation  process.  The  TRIP  experienced  difficulties  with  community  agitation  over  the\nneed for additional works to accommodate or facilitate communal or private enterprises. Under\nthe Project, community participation will be promoted.\n\n34.\nThe evaluation impact study rated ADB's assistance as successful, although within this\noverall  assessment  there  is  variability.  The  EWH  upgrading  and  periodic  maintenance  was\nhighly successful, while the hill road improvement and institutional strengthening assistance was\nless  than  successful.  The  provision  of  initial  access  allowing  motorized  transport  to  replace\nrelatively high-cost porter and pack animal transport produced better results.\n\nADB's institutional strengthening efforts through TA12 have been relatively minor, but this\n35.\nis partly because of low absorptive capacity within the sector and the large effort supported by\nother  external  agencies.  Although  ADB  contributed  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  to  road  planning,  it\nmissed opportunities to address road development on a more comprehensive basis. The World\nBank,  DFID,  and  SDC,  among  others,  have  subsequently  been  actively  involved  in  policy\ndialogue  with  the  Government,  and  major  actions  have  been  taken  to  date,  including  (i)\ninstitutional capacity building, and (ii) road maintenance planning and funding construction and\nimplementation. ADB has been supportive of these efforts and is concentrating on ensuring that\nits operations complement these initiatives.\n\n36.\nIn  the  hill  areas,  the  study  reveals  that  traffic  volumes  are  inadequate  to  generate\nsufficient quantifiable economic benefits from road user cost savings to justify the expenditures\nneeded to upgrade roads to sealed all-weather status. As suggested in the study, other benefits,\nsuch  as  those  from  increased  agricultural  output,  social  improvements,  or  enhanced  national\nintegration, must be assured, or lower-cost approaches devised, to justify expenditure on road\nimprovement  in  these  areas.  The  results  in  the  Far  Western  Region  indicate  that  agricultural\ndevelopment  may  not  necessarily  follow  road  development,  and  specific  interventions  may  be\nrequired  to  ensure  that  the  expected  development  occurs.  However,  the  experience  in  the\neastern  hills  shows  that  agricultural  development  may  result  from  road  development  without\nmuch additional assistance. The proposed Project will complete the missing link in the Eastern\nRegion, canceled from TRIP, where economic activities are expected to increase following the\nroad  improvement.  Completing  the  link  should  result  in  achievement  of  the  development\nobjective  of  the  TRIP.  In  addition,  under  the  Project  a  poverty  intervention  in  the  area  of  hill\nroads is being proposed to ensure that the Project will bring about social improvements in the\nproject areas.\n\n37.\nThe focus on using local contractors and packaging contracts into forms suitable for this\nin ADB-funded projects has contributed to the availability of work to support growth of the local\ncontracting  industry,  and  parallels  similar  increasing  use  of  domestic  contractors  by  other\nfunding  agencies  in  the  road  subsector.  The  good  performance  of  the  completed  works\nsuggests that local contractors are capable of handling most of the types of road works, except\nfor  laying  asphalt  concrete.  The  quantity  of  such  work  in  Nepal  is  relatively  small,  does  not\nsupport the purchase of paving machines by contractors, and limits the number and location of\nasphalt plants; as a consequence, international contractor support may be needed.\n\n                  \n\n12 TA 764-NEP: Transport Sector Profile Project, for $350,000, approved on 13 May 1986; TA 824-NEP: Institutional\nStrengthening of the Department of Roads, for $335,000, approved on 2 December 1986; and TA 1216-NEP: Road\nand Road Transport Institutional Development, for $875,000, approved on 9 November 1989.\n\n\fE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n9\n\n38.\nOver  the  past  two  decades  much  of  ADB's  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  in  Nepal\nfocused on improving the strategic road network. The rationale was that efficient transportation\nis essential for economic and social development. The country's SRN needed to be completed,\nand  those  parts  of  the  network  that  were  poorly  constructed  and  maintained  or  were\napproaching their design life needed strengthening or rehabilitation.\n\nIn  November  1999,  ADB  adopted  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  operational\n39.\nobjective.13 ADB and the Government have signed a poverty reduction partnership agreement\non  21  October  2001  to  outline  the  actions  that  both  sides  will  take  to  address  poverty  in  the\ncountry.  The  2001  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  update  takes  a  very  strong  poverty\nreduction direction, based on the priorities enunciated in the 1999 country operational strategy,\nthe  ADB  poverty  assessment,  the  Government\u2019s  interim  poverty  reduction  strategy,  and  the\nHigh-Level  Poverty  Forum.  The  overarching  objective  of  the  CSP  update  is  to  achieve  a\nsustainable reduction in poverty through (i) generation of productive employment opportunities\nand increased rural incomes resulting from faster and broad-based pro-poor economic growth,\n(ii) equitable improvements in basic social services to enhance human development resulting in\nreduction of population growth, and (iii) good governance. Prioritization of support for a smaller\nnumber  of  key  sectors  has  been  adopted.  The  CSP  update  focuses  on  up  to  seven  areas,\nincluding (i) agriculture and rural development as the primary sectoral focal point; (ii) transport;\n(iii)  energy;  (iv)  finance;  (v)  education,  including  nonformal  education;  (vi)  water  supply,\nsanitation,  and  urban  development;  and  (vii)  environmental  management.  Projects  in  the\nprogram  will  be  designed  to  target  socially  excluded  groups,  and  to  reduce  poverty  and\ninequality.\n\n40.\nADB's  strategic  objectives  in  the  transport  sector  are  to  (i)  continue  to  improve  the\nexisting  core  network,  (ii)  ensure  adequate  funding  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  existing\ntransport facilities, (iii) support subregional linkages, (iv) strengthen institutions, and (v) promote\nprivate  sector  participation.  These  objectives  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  sectoral  goal  of\npromoting  economic  growth  and  thereby  reducing  poverty.14  A  transport  sector  strategy  for\nNepal  is  being  prepared.  The  approaches  of  the  strategy  are  to  (i)  contribute  to  broad-based\neconomic  growth  to  provide  the  context  and  framework  within  which  to  achieve  poverty\nreduction; (ii) target the poor to ensure that the benefits from growth reach all sectors and are\npro-poor in nature; and (iii) provide employment and work opportunities for the poor through the\nadoption  of  labor  intensive  methods  for  construction.  The  strategy  has  two  main  thrusts:  (i)  to\nensure  continued,  accelerated,  and  stable  growth  in  the  economy;  and  (ii)  to  improve  access\ninto remote areas with high poverty levels.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n41.\nADB  has  been  continuously  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  road  issues  with  the\nGovernment;  this  has  contributed  to  the  improvement  of  project  implementation  performance,\nincreased  participation  of \nin  road  construction  and\nlocal  contractors  and  consultants \nimprovement,  prioritized  investment  on  SRN  development,  and  increased  priority  for  road\nmaintenance  including  increased  annual  budget  and  improved  planning.

Under the\nproposed  Project,  the  principal  issues  to  be  addressed  include  improving  governance,\nperformance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contracting,  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  road\nsafety  and  heavy  vehicle  management,  private  sector  development,  and  subregional\ncooperation.\n\n1. \n\nImproving Greater Transparency and Accountability\n\nADB  has  provided  two  TAs15  and  one  loan16  to  improve  governance  in  the  country.\n42.\nContracting, bid evaluation, and implementation processes in public works have been identified\nas  areas  in  which  systemic  improvements  will  reduce  corruption  and  inefficiencies.  These\nimprovements will aid project implementation. Under an ongoing ADB TA to strengthen project\nimplementation practices,17 public works directives are being prepared. The new directives will\nclearly delineate roles and responsibilities of government officials involved in all aspects of the\nproject  cycle,  from  project  design,  through  prequalification,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation,  to\nimplementation.  The  directives  will  outline  the  processes  to  be  followed  at  all  stages  of  the\nproject cycle, and will include organizational directives, standard bidding documents, procedural\ndirectives, and a compendium of reference documents. The recommendations and procedures\ncontained in the directives will be incorporated in amended financial administration regulations.\nThe  directives  are  expected  to  contribute  to  improved  transparency  and  accountability  at  all\nstages of the project cycle, particularly in prequalification, tendering, and bid evaluation.\n\n2. \n\nImproving Road Maintenance Efficiency\n\nMaintenance18  has  consistently  been  underfunded.  With  substantial  development\n43.\nassistance  for  maintenance,  the  SRN  condition  appears  to  have  improved  over  the  past  few\nyears,  although  much  effort  and  attention  is  necessary  for  routine  and  recurrent  road\nmaintenance. The amount actually spent on routine and recurrent maintenance is considerably\nless than the funds allocated.\n\n44.\nThe  ongoing  World  Bank-supported  RMDP  is  developing  a  mechanism  for  earmarking\nroad user revenues for maintenance. A Nepal road board act will be enacted and a Nepal road\nboard will be established to oversee a road fund (para. 25). The fund is expected to cover about\n60-70  percent  of  road  maintenance  requirements.  After  passage  of  Road  Board  Bill  by  the\nParliament  (para.  25),  many  follow-up  actions  will  be  needed  to  make  the  road  board  fully\noperational and interim support will be necessary.\n\n45.\nThe  current  main  initiative  to  improve  road  maintenance  capacity  is  the  Strengthened\nMaintenance  Division  Program,  financed  by  DFID  and  SDC.  Under  the  program,  routine  and\nrecurrent  road  maintenance  works  are  being  carried  out  by  laborers  who  work  on  a  length  of\n\n                  \n\n15 TA  3580-NEP:  Strengthening Corporate and Financial Governance, for  $3,300,000,  approved  on  14  December\n2000; and TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January\n2001.\n\n16 Loan 1811-NEP: Corporate and Financial Governance Project, for $7.3 million, approved on 14 December 2000.\n17 TA 3306-NEP: Strengthening Project Implementation Practices, for $820,000, approved on 24 November 1999.\n18 Types  of  road  maintenance:  (i)  routine  maintenance,  such  as  cleaning  drainage  and  cutting  of  grass,  required\ncontinuously  on  every  road;  (ii)  recurrent  maintenance,  such  as  repairing  potholes,  grading,  patching,  trimming,\nfilling, and resealing cracks, required at intervals within a fiscal year, to keep the pavement in good condition; (iii)\nemergency maintenance, required to deal with emergency situations such as landslide, erosion, flood, etc.; and (iv)\nperiodic  maintenance,  such  as  regraveling  and  surfacing,  required  at  intervals  of  several  years  to  rejuvenate  the\nroad pavement.\n\n\f11\n\nroad and are paid per day of work. Maintenance work financed by the proposed road fund will\nbe  executed  by  contract.  Transitional  activity  will  be  needed  to  ensure  the  new  system  is\nimplemented smoothly and does not result in any social disruption.\n\nUnder the proposed Project, the Government has agreed to develop a pilot program for\n46.\nthree-year road maintenance of about 200-300 km of road through PBM contracts tendered to\ndomestic private contractors. Roads to be maintained will be selected using the highway design\nand  maintenance  standard  model  ranking  as  part  of  the  ARMP  under  the  RMDP.  Among  the\nranked roads, PBM will be targeted in districts with poverty rates equal to or above the national\naverage. The Project will finance the preparation works and the first year of implementation. In\nthe second and third years of implementation, the Government will finance contractors\u2019 payment\nfrom  the  road  fund,  and  will  supervise  and  monitor  the  works;  in  this  way  the  Project  will\nencourage the Government to make the road board fully operational.\n\n3. \n\nPromoting Private Sector Participation\n\nEven  though  the  policy  on  private  sector  participation  on  public  infrastructure  was\n47.\napproved by the Government in 2000, a proper legal infrastructure framework is not yet in place.\nFurthermore, the low level of traffic (generally less than 3,000 vpd) is hardly enough to attract\nprivate  sector  interest  in  exploring  concession  arrangements.  In  recent  years,  competitive\ntendering  processes  were  introduced  to  encourage  private  sector  involvement  in  civil  works\nfinanced  by  external  agencies.  International  consultants  have  provided  project  management\nassistance to the contractors they are supervising. Furthermore, in the process of establishing\nthe  road  fund  board  and  draft  road  board  act,  a  viable  partnership  between  the  public  and\nprivate sector has developed. The road fund should also help strengthen the private sector by\ncreating jobs and providing continuous contracts for maintenance.\n\n48.\nUnder previous projects, ADB encouraged the Government to improve conditions under\nwhich  the  local  contracting  industry  could  develop.  Importantly,  the  Government  reduced  or\neliminated  customs  duties  and  sales  taxes  on  imported  construction  equipment.  While  the\ndomestic  contractors  have  performed  adequately,  their  most  serious  concern  is  that  the  work\nunder  all  funding  sources  is  not  continuous  but  is  intermittent  and  thus  has  not  contributed  to\nsound  development  of  local  contractor  capabilities.  Under  the  Project,  more  than  a  half  of  all\ncivil works packages will be procured using local contractors. In particular, a pilot PBM program\nwill  be  developed  and  may  be  replicated  for  future  road  maintenance.  This  may  expand  the\nvolume  of  work  and  provide  a  more  stable  flow  of  work,  thus  helping  develop  the  local\ncontracting industry.\n\n4. \n\nImproving Road Safety and Axle-Load Control\n\nThe  increase  in  vehicle  density,  together  with  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor\n49.\ndiscipline and enforcement, and poor roadworthiness of vehicles, has led to increases in road\naccidents. In 1994, Nepal experienced 63 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, one of the highest rates\nof road accident fatalities in the world. 19\n\n50.\nTraffic  accident  data  are  not  yet  collected  comprehensively  or  systematically  in  Nepal.\nThe Traffic Engineering and Safety Unit (TESU) established in DOR in 1994 with aid from DFID,\nhas  collected  traffic  accident  data  and  conducted  safety  audits  for  a  very  limited  number  of\nroads within the urban limits of Kathmandu Valley. Individual police stations have some data for\n\n19 ADB. 1997. Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region \u2013 Road Safety Trends. Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\f12\n\ntheir areas of responsibility, but the information varies in detail and typically covers only recent\nyears.\n\n51.\nTESU  has  produced  a  traffic  sign  manual,  road  safety  notes,  research  reports,  and  a\nhighway  code;  and  conducted  training  for  traffic  police  personnel,  seminars,  road  safety\nengineering,  and  campaigns.  However,  road  safety  in  Nepal  is  only  slowly  being  accorded\nimportance; the establishment of TESU is a good first step. Expansion of more systematic and\ncomprehensive  data  collection  is  required,  leading  to  safety  audits  and  the  identification  of\nthe\nproblem  areas.  High-level \nimplementation  and  expansion  of  the  existing  program,  the  Government  agreed  to  establish  a\nroad  safety  committee,  chaired  by  the  DOR  director  general  to  improve  the  coordination  of\nTESU-DOR,  traffic  police,  Department  of  Traffic  Management  (DOTM),  Ministry  of  Education,\nand Ministry of Health. When required, at least twice a year, the committee will meet to review\nprogress of the road safety program and resolve issues that require interdepartmental decisions\nand coordination.\n\ninterdepartmental  coordination \n\nis  needed.  To \n\nimprove \n\nSuccessful  management  of  heavy  vehicle  loads  will  result  in  more  economical  road\n52.\ndesigns  and  reduced  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  costs.  As  vehicle  loads  become\nheavier, their damaging effect, as measured by their equivalent standard axle loads, increases\nvery rapidly and disproportionately with the actual increase in load. MPPW has, in accordance\nwith  the  Vehicle  and  Transport  Management  Act  (1993/94),  set  a  maximum  legal  limit  of  10.2\nton  per  axle  for  all  vehicles.  However,  DOTM,  the  enforcement  agency,  has  neither  the\nnecessary expertise nor logistics to make any sustained effort at controlling overloaded vehicles\nand consequently the limit is not enforced.\n\n53.\nA  working  paper,  Axle Loading on the SRN and Heavy Vehicle Management,  was\nprepared by DOR's Maintenance and Rehabilitation and Coordination Unit in January 1999. The\npaper,  based  on  axle-load  surveys,  reveals  that  although  buses  and  mini  trucks  do  not\nconstitute  a  significant  overloading  problem,  only  55  percent  of  all  trucks  and  28  percent  of\nloaded trucks are within the present legal limit. Furthermore, almost 30 percent of traffic-related\npavement  damage  is  caused  by  the  heaviest  4  percent  of  vehicles.  A  pragmatic  and\nenforceable  heavy  vehicle  management  policy  must  be  established  and  implemented  and  be\nacceptable to all the main agencies, such as MPPW, DOR, MPPW's Legal Section, and DOTM,\nas well as transport service organizations and Nepal Traffic Police. The Government agreed to\nproceed  with  the  preparation  of  the  policy  through  a  standard  committee  chaired  by  DOR  no\nlater than the end of 2002.\n\n5. \n\nPromoting Subregional Cooperation\n\n54.\nADB\u2019s activities in promoting regional cooperation accelerated significantly in the 1990s.\nThis  initiative  has  covered  technical  studies  and  workshops  to  support  cooperation  dialogue,\nphysical  investments  in  cross-border  projects,  and  where  appropriate,  assistance  for  cross-\nborder agreements in Southeast Asia and Central Asia. Drawing on this experience, ADB is now\nextending this assistance to eastern South Asia, where momentum for cooperation is growing.\nThe  four  countries  of  the  subregion  (Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal)  are  collectively\nknown as the South Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation initiative.\n\n\f13\n\nUnder a regional TA,20 a meeting of the chambers of commerce of Bangladesh, Bhutan,\n55.\nIndia,  and  Nepal  was  held  in  Kolkata,  India  on  28-29  November  2000.  The  forum  brought\ntogether  public  and  private  sector  representatives  as  a  step  toward  identifying  an  investment\nprogram to develop the region. The forum recognized that public-private partnerships would be\nthe  main  instrument  of  transformation,  especially  for  undertaking  infrastructure  projects  in  the\nsubregion.\n\nUnder  the  ongoing  regional  TA,21  a  one-year  study  was  launched  to  help  the\n56.\nparticipating countries identify subregional projects, prepare project profiles, and develop action\nprograms  for  subregional  cooperation  in  five  priority  areas,  namely,  transportation  and\ncommunications; energy and power; tourism; environment; and trade, investments, and private\nsector  cooperation.  This  TA  commenced  with  the  participation  of  Bangladesh,  Bhutan  and\nNepal.  At  the  inception  meeting,  held  in  Manila  on  22  and  23  March  2001,  government\nrepresentatives confirmed that the transport sector was a priority area for initial cooperation. In\nSeptember  2001,  India  expressed  its  interest  in  participating  in  the  regional  TA  activities.  In\nOctober 2001, a Transport Working Group has started with participation of four countries in the\nsubregion.\n\n6. \n\nReducing Poverty\n\nPoverty incidence is highest in remote areas, specifically those with few roads. Poverty\n57.\nand  isolation  are  linked:  when  people  are  isolated,  they  are  unable  to  access  economic  and\nsocial opportunities within the wider geographic region. Isolation through poor accessibility also\nslows the diffusion of new technologies; increases marketing and production costs; limits access\nto  health,  education,  and  other  social  infrastructure;  and  limits  access  to  employment\nopportunities  beyond  immediate  settlements.  Therefore,  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  road\ninvestments supported by ADB must be maximized.\n\nThis  is  in  line  with  the  Government's  Ninth  Plan  goal  of  poverty  reduction.  The  plan\n58.\n(1997-2002), for the first time, attempted to define long-term targets for several poverty-related\nindicators  and  oriented  itself  to  achieving  those  targets.  Its  goal  is  to  reduce  the  poverty\nincidence from 42 percent in 1997 to 32 percent by 2002 and to 10 percent by 2017. The plan\nidentifies  other  indicators  of  human  poverty,  such  as  illiteracy,  infant  mortality  rate,  maternal\nmortality  rate,  and  average  life  expectancy  at  birth,  and  sets  targets.  The  approach  to  overall\ndevelopment and poverty reduction, and the development strategy are clearly articulated in the\nplan  and other government-related documents. The strategy is three-pronged: (i) broad-based\ngrowth,  (ii)  social  sector  spending,  and  (iii)  targeted  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable\ngroups. Priority will be given to ensure, among other things, better accessibility to the poor and\ninaccessible areas of the country.\n\nImproving  physical  access  in  remote  areas  can  stimulate  pro-poor  economic  growth,\n59.\nthereby contributing to poverty reduction. The impact of road investments supported by ADB on\npoverty reduction can be maximized by targeting poorer districts, complemented by a program\nto  provide  or  improve  local  access  facilities  (trails,  pedestrian  bridges,  etc.);  and  introducing\ninnovative  approaches  to  transport  development  to  spread  benefits  more  equitably  to  the\nselected  poorest  districts  in  the  project  area.  For  instance,  the  Project  will  include  a  poverty\n\n                  \n\n20 TA  5890-REG:  First Meeting of the Private Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia\n\nSubregion, for $30,000, approved on 23 December 1999.\n\n21 TA 5936-REG: Identification and Prioritization of Subregional Projects in South Asia, for $785,000, approved on 22\n\nSeptember 2000.\n\n\f14\n\nintervention  component  to  improve  access  of  the  poor  to  the  feeder  roads.  This  will  enhance\nlivelihoods and access to sustainable benefits from wider longer-term economic opportunities.\n\n7. \n\nProtecting Women and Children\n\n60.\nThe  Government  of  Nepal,  as  a  member  of  the  International  Labor  Organization  has\nratified seven conventions relating to fundamental work-related principles and rights including (i)\nConvention  No.  138,  Concerning  the  Minimum  Age  for  Admission  to  Employment;  (ii)\nConvention No.182, Concerning the Worst Forms of Child Labor; and (iii) Convention No. 100,\nConcerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value. ADB is\ncommitted  to  supporting  the  Government  in  these  efforts.  To  ensure  that  gender  and  child\nconcerns  are  addressed,  the  Project  will  set  employment  targets  for  women  for  road\nconstruction activities, as well as require that contractors not differentiate wages between men\nand  women  for  work  of  equal  value,  not  hire  children  as  construction  laborers,  and  provide\nappropriate facilities for children in construction campsites. A specific clause will be included in\nbidding documents and compliance strictly monitored during project implementation.\n\n8. \n\nPromoting Community Participation\n\n61.\nDOR and ADB have learned from the TRIP that more active community consultation is\nneeded  during  road  design  and  implementation.  Projects  are  delayed  because  of  difficulty\nagreeing  to  compensation  and  community  agitation  for  additional  works  to  accommodate  or\nfacilitate  communal  or  private  enterprises.  Through  its  consultants,  the  Project  will  promote\nconsultation  and  coordination  between  the  district  administration,  project  officers  of  DOR,\ncontractors, communities, and NGOs.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n62.\nEfficient  transport,  in  particular  improved  access,  is  one  of  the  keys  to  economic\ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction.  Investment  in  roads  is  part  of  a  continuing  program  to\nsupport  the  development  of  an  integrated  and  balanced  road  network  in  the  country.  The\nimprovement  of  feeder  roads  to  an  all-weather  maintainable  standard  will  establish  effective\ncommunications  to  serve  major  agricultural  production  centers  and  other  socioeconomic\nfacilities.  The  construction  of  a  new  district  headquarters  access  road  will  establish  effective\nconnections between district communities and the national road network. Ensuring the EWH is\nin  a  maintainable  condition  is  essential  for  supporting  domestic  trade  and  promoting  the\ndevelopment  of  subregional  activities.  Institutional  capacity  for  preserving  the  existing  asset\nbase  of  the  road  network  needs  to  be  improved.  Considering  the  high  rate  of  fatal  traffic\naccidents in Nepal, road safety in the country must also be improved.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  improve  transport\n63.\nefficiency  and  thereby  enable  the  country  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  job  creation,\nleading  to  reduction  of  poverty.  The  Project  will  (i)  maintain,  improve,  and  develop  the  road\nnetwork  to  induce  more  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  passengers,  and  to  provide  better\naccess  to  income  and  employment  opportunities  and  to  education  and  health  centers;  (ii)\n\n\f15\n\nimprove public sector implementation and maintenance capacity in the road sector; (iii) support\ndevelopment  of  private  sector  capabilities  to  carry  out  road  improvement  and  maintenance  by\ncontract; (iv) improve road safety and axle-load control; and (v) provide community access and\ncomplementary facilities through a participatory approach leading to poverty reduction.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\nThe scope of the Project will include (i) strengthening pavement of about 140 km of the\n64.\nEWH;  (ii)  upgrading  approximately  165  km  of  feeder  and  district  roads  in  the  hill  and  terai\nregions  to  all-weather  paved  surface;  (iii)  constructing  a  district  headquarters  access  road  of\nabout  96  km  using  environment-friendly,  labor-based  construction  methods;  (iv)  developing  a\nroad  maintenance  program  for  about  200-300  km  through  PBM  contracts;  (v)  improving  an\naccess  road  for  the  cross-border  facility  in  Kakarbhitta;  (vi)  providing  community  access  and\ncomplementary facilities; and (vii) providing consulting services for detailed design preparation,\nbidding  processes,  project  management,  construction  supervision,  preparing  and  supervising\nthe PBM program, road safety improvement, and heavy vehicle control.\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  in  accordance  with  the  priorities  of  the  2001  CSP  update  to\n65.\nreduce  poverty  through  economic  growth,  improve  access  to  education  and  health  services,\nprotect  disadvantaged  groups,  promote  community  participation,  support  private  sector\ndevelopment,  protect  the  environment,  and  promote  regional  cooperation.  The  roads  were\nselected  from  21  candidate  roads  based  on  economic  analysis  and  economic  internal  rate  of\nreturn, and further studied in terms of project focus, urgency, social benefits, and environmental\nsensitivity.  A  summary  of  the  design  approach  and  technical  standards  for  resurfacing  EWH,\nand road improvement and construction components is attached as Appendix 7.\n\na. \n\nEast-West Highway Strengthening Component\n\nThe  Project  will  finance  pavement  strengthening  on  about  140  km  of  the  EWH,22  from\n66.\nBelbari to Chuharwa.  The EWH section was selected considering its role as the backbone of\nthe national road network and as the main access to India. As part of the Asian Highway (AH2),\nthe improved EWH and cross-border access road will support subregional cooperation efforts.\n\nb. \n\nRoads Improvement Component\n\n67.\nThe  Project  will  improve  approximately  165  km  of  feeder  roads  and  important  district\nroads  in  the  hill  and  terai  regions  to  all-weather  paved  surface.  The  investment  will  cover  (i)\nDolalghat-Chautara, 25 km; (ii) Biratnagar-Bardanga, 39 km; (iii) Urlabari-Bardanga, 28 km; (iv)\nDamak-Gauriganj,  22  km;  (v)  Pouwa  Bhanjyang-Phidim,  24  km;23  and  (vi)  Hile-Basantpur,  26\nkm.24\n\nc. \n\nFeeder-Road Construction Component\n\n68.\nThe  Project  includes  the  construction  of  about  96  km  of  feeder  road  to  connect\nBasantpur  to  Khandbari,  a  district  headquarters.25  This  will  be  the  first  intervention  road  to\nSankhuwasabha district headquarters now not connected to the road network. The section will\n\n22 The last rehabilitation and resurfacing of the section were completed in 1994 under Loan 806-NEP (footnote 11) for\n\n                  \n\na 10-year life.\n\n23 Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim is an incomplete link owing to shortage of funds under the TRIP.\n24 Cofinancing by DFID has been confirmed to finance this road section.\n25 Cofinancing by DFID has been confirmed to finance this component.\n\n\f16\n\nbe  implemented  using  labor-oriented  construction  methods  geared  to  maximizing  local\nparticipation  and  addressing  the  objective  of  poverty  reduction  complementarily  with  other\nefforts  supported  by  DFID.  The  works  include  improvement  of  14  km  of  earthen  road  from\nKhandbari completed by GTZ and about 40 km track from Basantpur carried out by DOR, and\nconstruction of the 42 km missing link in between to all-weather gravel road.\n\nd. \n\nPerformance-Based Maintenance Component\n\nThe Project will develop a three-year road maintenance program and provide financing\n69.\nfor  first-year  for  about  200-300  km  of  road  through  PBM  contracts26  tendered  to  domestic\nprivate contractors. Roads to be maintained will be selected from the ARMP. Among the ranked\nroads, the PBM component will be targeted in districts with poverty rates equal to or above the\nnational  average.  Support  will  be  restricted  to  routine,  recurrent,  and  periodic  maintenance.\nRoad widening and improvement will be excluded. The concept of PBM and criteria for selecting\nsubprojects  are  outlined  in  Appendix  8.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  develop  the\nprogram, train DOR officials and local contractors, assist with contract award, and supervise the\nworks in the first year of implementation. During the second and third years of implementation,\nthe Government will finance the payment to the contractors from the Nepal road fund, and DOR\nwill supervise and monitor the works. During this period, the consultant will monitor and evaluate\nimplementation annually, and prepare a final report including its findings, lessons learned, and\nrecommendations for replication.\n\n70.\nThe  PBM  component  will  be  implemented  in  four  contracts,  each  over  three  years,\nincluding  three  major  maintenance  components:  preventive  work,  catch-up  routine  work,  and\nperformance (routine and recurrent work). Preventive maintenance is designed to improve the\nroads'  structural  condition.  Catch-up  routine  maintenance  is  designed  to  reduce  the  present\nmaintenance backlog, particularly for shoulders and drainage. Some minor improvements may\nbe  included  such  as  additional  drainage  structures,  slope  protection,  guardrails,  road  signs,\nmarkings,  and  reconstruction  of  short  sections.  After  preventive  and  catch-up  routine\nmaintenance is completed, performance maintenance will begin.\n\n71.\nThe  preventive  and  catch-up  routine  maintenance  works  will  be  executed  and  paid  for\nbased  on  the  quantity  of  work  completed.  The  performance  maintenance,  however,  will  be\nexecuted according to minimum standards set in the contract. If contractors fail to maintain the\nstandard,  the  monthly  lump  sum  payment  will  be  reduced,  according  to  the  penalties  for\nnoncompliance delineated in the contract.\n\ne. \n\nCross-Border Access Road Improvement Component  \n\nConsidering  possible  ADB  commitment  to  subregional  transport  improvement,  the\n72.\nProject  will  allocate  adequate  funds  to  improve  an  access  road  of  about  10  km  to  the  border\ncrossing  at  Kakarbhitta.27  The  access  road  will  have  sufficient  width  and  strength  to\naccommodate fully loaded trucks, and widen as it approaches the checkpoint to create a waiting\narea large enough to handle the normal weekly peak traffic. As appropriate, it will be equipped\nwith a weigh station for checking the axle-load of trucks entering Nepal.\n\n                  \n\n26 A  PBM  contract  is  an  agreement  between  a  government  department  or  state  enterprise  and  a  private  contractor\nwhereby the private contractor maintains the road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain period of\ntime in return for a fixed payment stream. The private sector maintains an existing road on the basis of customer-\nbased performance indicators, such as riding and strength quality, safety features, and aesthetics of the roadside.\n27 This component is subject to findings of the ongoing TA 5936-REG: Identification and Prioritization of Subregional\n\nProjects in South Asia and the following TA on Subregional Roads Connections programmed for 2003.\n\n\f17\n\nf. \n\nRoad Safety and Axle-Load Control Component\n\n73.\nThe  Project  will  undertake  road  safety  civil  works  at  selected  accident-prone  areas  or\nblack  spots  and  axle-load  measurement  along  the  project  roads  and  selected  cross-border\nlocations.  Improving  road  safety  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Road  Safety\nGuidelines. Training and public awareness on road safety improvement will be provided. Road\ndesigns will be improved by (i) improving delineation and edge marking on hill roads including\nuse of reflecting marker posts; (ii) installing deviation (chevron) boards in critical locations; (iii)\nwidening  the  pavement  sections  of  main  roads  with  high  volumes  of  pedestrians,  cycles,  and\nanimal-drawn vehicles; (iv) providing off-road facilities for pedestrians in settlements, including\nfacilities  for  buses  and  bus  passengers;  and  (v)  providing  adequate  reflective  warning  signs,\nsetting realistic speed limits, and building speed bumps on roads through settlements. A safety\naudit  will  be  conducted  after  the  design  phase  prior  to  procurement  to  comply  with  safety\nrequirements.  An  information  campaign  on  heavy  vehicle  management  will  be  made  for\nenforcement agencies as well as truck and bus owners, drivers, and associations. The Project\nwill procure 10 sets of portable weigh-bridges, for which locations and technical specification will\nbe determined during the detailed design phase, subject to ADB review and approval.\n\ng. \n\nPoverty Intervention Component\n\nThe primary objective of this component is to reduce poverty by (i) physical interventions\n74.\nto  improve  rural  accessibility  for  the  poor  and  those  socially  excluded  by  constructing  tracks,\ntrails,  footpaths,  pedestrian  bridges,  slope  protection,  bus  station/stops,  and  markets  at\ncommunity-selected  locations  to  meet  their  domestic,  economic,  and  social  needs;  and  (ii)\nsocial  development  interventions  to  ensure  that  the  poorest  and  socially  excluded  can  benefit\nfrom  the  longer-term  socioeconomic  opportunities  the  road  may  bring.  This  would  include  (i)\ncommunity-based  construction  of  facilities  to  improve  community  access,  (ii)  formation  of  a\nrevolving  fund  and  capacity  building  and  training  for  community  groups  on  how  to  use  the\nincome  and  invest  in  income  generating  activities,  and  (iii)  enhancement  and  development  of\nprotective interventions.28\n\n75.\nThe  social  development  intervention  will  be  financed  and  implemented  in  parallel  by\nDFID  along  two  road  sections,  Hile-Basantpur  and  Basantpur-Khandbari  roads,  aside  from  its\ncofinancing  program  under  the  Project.  A  separate  poverty  intervention  for  the  other  project\nareas is being proposed for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction financing on a grant basis.\n\nThe  poverty  impact  component  will  be  targeted  to  the  rural  poor  and  disadvantaged\n76.\ngroups,  including  ethnic  minority  groups.  Appendix  9  provides  a  summary  of  the  poverty\nintervention and ethnic minority development plan.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n77.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $69.5  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  Foreign\nexchange costs are estimated at $45.2 million representing 65 percent of the total project cost.\nThe local currency cost is estimated at $24.3 million equivalent representing 35 percent of the\ntotal cost.

DFID  will  provide  a  grant  of  \u00a37.064  million\n78.\nequivalent (about $9.6 million), or 13.8 percent of total project cost, to finance a portion of civil\nworks  construction  (feeder-road  construction  component  and  Hile-Basantpur  of  the  road\nimprovement  component,  which  are  not  financed  by  ADB).  This  grant  will  be  administered  by\nADB.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  $46.0  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to\nfinance 84.1 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 32.9 percent of the local currency costs;\n66.6  percent  of  the  total  project  cost.  Local  cost  financing  is  necessary  in  view  of  the  high\npercentage  of  local  currency  expenditures  and  the  Government's  fiscal  constraints.

Both\nMPPW and DOR have substantial experience with implementing ADB-financed road projects. A\nproject  directorate,  which  was  established  and  fully  functional  under  previous  projects,  will  be\nmaintained  within  DOR  for  overall  project  coordination,  monitoring,  and  implementation.  DOR\nwill maintain the appointed full-time project director, and promptly inform ADB of any change of\nthe  project  director.  DOR  will  ensure  that  the  person  appointed  will  (i)  be  a  senior  officer  with\nadequate technical and administration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB; and (ii)\nassisted  by  appropriate  and  adequate  technical  and  administrative  staff.  The  Government  will\nexert  its  best  endeavors  to  ensure  that,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  the  initially\nappointed director will be maintained in the position for a minimum of two years, during project\nimplementation.\n\n80.\nDOR  has  appointed  four  full-time  project  managers,  based  in  Chautara,  Dharan,\nBasantpur,  and  Damak,  to  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation,  and  report  to  the\nproject director.\n\n81.\nThe  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  PBM,  including  subproject\nselection  under  the  ARMP,  procurement,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  will  act  as  project\ncoordinator  for  this  component.  However,  contract  administration  and  other  aspects  of  day-to-\nday implementation will be delegated to DOR's maintenance divisions. The project director will\ncoordinate with the road board to select subprojects and arrange payment for the second and\nthird years of implementation.\n\nThe project director will also coordinate with DFID, for feeder-road construction and the\n\n82.\nProject's detailed design and supervision consultants will coordinate with DFID's consultants.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n83.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  inclusive  of  preconstruction  activities.\nThe Project is expected to be completed by June 2007. The civil works will be implemented in\ntwo  phases,  commencing  around  June  2003.  This  schedule  is  subject  to  a  number  of  events\noccurring,  including  (i)  advance  action  being  undertaken,  and  (ii)  DOR  appointing  the\n\n\f20\n\nsupervision  consultant  by  March  2002.  A  summary  implementation  schedule  is  attached  as\nAppendix 11.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n84.\nThe  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement  activities.  The  civil  works\ncontracts will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding and local competitive\nbidding procedures, for about 6 and 24 contract packages respectively, as indicated in Appendix\n12. Civil works packages with contract values more than $1.0 million will be contracted through\ninternational competitive bidding.\n\nAll  contracts  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.\n85.\nADB's  standard  bidding  documents  for  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  used.\nProcurement for local competitive bidding will be in accordance with procedures acceptable to\nADB.\n\nFor the Basantpur-Khandbari works, construction methods will be in accordance with the\n86.\nconstruction  procedures  being  developed  by  DFID.  Wherever  possible  the  works  will  be\nundertaken  by  road  building  groups  (which  will  be  formed  and  trained  under  the  poverty\nintervention  component)  and \nforums.  Where\nconstruction  equipment  and  imported  materials  are  required  to  achieve  specified  quality\nstandards,  the  works  may  be  contracted  to  local  contractors.  Standard  bidding  documents  for\ncommunity-based organizations, prepared under the ongoing TA (footnote 17), could be used if\nacceptable to ADB.\n\nthrough  village  consultative \n\nimplemented \n\n87.\nBlack spots improvement, to reduce traffic accidents, will be implemented as part of the\nrelated  road  contract  packages.  Axle-load  measurement  equipment  will  be  procured  under\ninternational shopping procedures. International shopping will be accepted for supply contracts\nvalued at less than $500,000, and direct purchase will be applied for small or off-the-shelf items\nvalued at less than $100,000.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n88.\nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  the  (i)  detailed  design  and  construction\nsupervision for the civil works under the east-west highway strengthening, roads improvement,\nfeeder-road construction, cross-border access road improvement and road safety and axle-load\ncontrol; (ii) program design and implementation supervision for PBM; and (iii) poverty reduction\nimpact  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  also  be  responsible \nfor  ensuring  community\nparticipation, identifying community needs, and monitoring gender and child labor issues. About\n170  person-months  of  international  and  1,700  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be\nrequired. Outline terms of reference for these services are in Appendix 13.\n\n89.\nAll  consultants  will  be  selected  and  appointed  by  DOR  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of\nconsultants.\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement\n\n90.\nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and\n\n\f21\n\ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in\nthe  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  the  estimated  expenditures  for  six  months.  The  account\nwill  be  established  with  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  To  expedite  disbursement  during  implementation,\nstatement  of  expenditures  will  be  used  for  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  A  separate  imprest\naccount will be established for DFID-financed components.\n\n6. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\na. \n\nReports\n\n91.\nThe  supervision  consultant  will  submit  monthly  progress  reports  to  DOR,  MPPW,  and\nADB. DOR will ensure that the consultant includes in the reports the status of land acquisition,\nresettlement,  environmental  management,  training,  public  campaign,  and  other  activities  that\nare  critical  to  project  implementation,  but  are  not  directly  included  in  the  scope  of  the\nengineering  services.  Within  three  months  of  physical  completion,  DOR  will  have  the  project\nconsultant submit a project completion report in a format acceptable to DOR and ADB.\n\n92.\nDOR  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the\nimplementation schedule, and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that could result\nin the schedule not being met.\n\nb. \n\nAccounts and Audits\n\n93.\nDOR  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and\nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts for all project expenditures will\nbe set up in accordance with consistent and sound accounting principles. Consolidated project\naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not\nlater than nine months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n7. \n\nMidterm Review\n\n94.\nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews  by  ADB  staff,  the  Project  will  require  a  detailed  midterm\nreview by the Government, ADB, and any cofinancier to consider progress on the Project and\nagree  upon  any  changes  to  scope  or  implementation  arrangements  needed  to  safeguard\nachievement of the project objectives. The midterm review will be conducted before the second\nphase of procurement.\n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n95.\nDOR,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultant,  will  develop  a  baseline  for  performance\nmonitoring in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, and\nestablish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring \nincluding  benefits  monitoring  and\nevaluation. The survey will be conducted prior to construction, and three months, one year, and\nfour years after completion of construction. The field information to be collected will include (i)\nroad  condition  and  road  roughness;  (ii)  traffic  volume;  (iii)  road  freight  rates  and  passenger\nfares;  (iii)  prices  in  local  markets  for  agricultural  produce,  agricultural  inputs,  and  basic\nhousehold  goods;  and  (iv)  any  other  information,  including  socioeconomic  indicators  and  key\nindicators  and  assumptions  outlined  at  output  and  development  objective  levels  in  the  project\n\n\f22\n\nframework  (Appendix  1).  The  outline  project  performance  management  system  is  in  Appendix\n14.\nF. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n96.\nThe Project is classified as environmental category A because one of the project roads,\nBasantpur-Khandbari,29  will  be  built  as  a  new  alignment.  The  other  project  roadworks  will  be\nlimited to maintenance and improvement of existing roads, and will include minimum widening\nor changes of alignment, and therefore have minimal adverse impacts on the environment. The\neffect  on  forest  and  wildlife  of  east-west  highway  strengthening  and  road  improvement\ncomponents is considered minimal since the roads do not pass through any forest reserves and\nnational parks.\n\n97.\nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared,  drawing  on  the  EIA  for  the\nBasantpur-Khandbari  road  and  initial  environmental  examination  for  other  road  sections.  The\nsummary  EIA  was  circulated  to  ADB's  Board  of  Directors  on  8  August  2001.  The  overall\nconclusion  of  the  EIA  is  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction\nand  operation  of  the  project  facilities  can  be  mitigated  by  implementing  a  set  of  mitigation\nmeasures.  Costs  for  environmental  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  project  cost\nestimates,  and  such  funds  will  be  provided  on  a  timely  basis  to  ensure  that  environmental\nimpacts  will  be  minimized  to  acceptable  levels  and  will  meet  Government  as  well  as  ADB\nenvironmental requirements. The Government's procedure includes presentation of EIA findings\nfollowed  by  a  public  hearing  to  solicit  comments  and  inputs  at  the  affected  areas  prior  to\nclearance  of  the  document  by  the  Ministry  of  Population  and  Environment.  This  Government\nclearance will be made as a condition of Board consideration.\n\n98.\nAlthough  the  official  right-of-way  of  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road  is  30  m,  DOR  will\nrestrict  the  work  within  a  basic  construction  width  of  6.5  m.  The  road  passes  through  several\nfragments of forestland totaling 14.8 km in length, and occupying 14.9 hectares (ha). The first\n9.0  km  of  the  road  will  pass  through  a  potential  community  conservation  area  containing\nendemic  Rhododendron  plant  species,30  i.e.,  Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale  area.  While  the\nboundaries of the area have not been determined, the gross area, which will act as a reservoir\nand buffer area is about 160-200 square km and encompasses 20 villages. The areas through\nwhich the road passes are below 2,500 m altitude, within the agricultural limits, and hence, have\nbeen highly disturbed by human interference. No pristine forest areas remain along the road. In\nmany  cases,  the  forest  has  been  replaced  with  low  shrubs,  which  may  have  little  value  to  be\nincluded in the Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale conservation area.\n\n99.\nSome forests covering about 10,000 ha, in the proposed conservation area, have been\nhanded  over  to  about  32  community  forest  user  groups.  The  World  Conservation  Union  has\nbeen providing support to strengthen the community forest user groups, including development\nof  (i)  sustainable  uses  of  the  forest  and  natural  resources,  (ii)  more  efficient  wood  stoves  and\nalternative  sources  of  fuel,  and  (iii)  ecotourism  as  a  sustainable  economic  use  of  the  forest.\nThus, the community has some degree of awareness to conserve the area, and therefore may\nnot  allow  additional  exploitation  of  the  rhododendron  and  other  forest  species  for  fuelwood.\nConsultation  meetings  with  NGOs  were  undertaken  on  the  proposed  Project\u2019s  environmental\n\n                  \n\n29 The section was one of the proposed World Bank-financed Arun III Hydropower access roads, canceled in 1989.\n30 An  area  located  more  than  1,700  m  above  sea  level  is  considered  a  good  potential  for  the  conservation  of  the\n\nendemic Rhododendron species.\n\n\f23\n\nand  social  impacts,  including  the  impacts  on  the  proposed  Tinjure-Milkedanda-Jaljale\nconservation  area.  The  NGOs  support  the  need  for  the  Project  and  are  not  opposed  to  any\nproject components.\n\n2. \n\nSocial\n\n100.\nIn accordance with the ADB guidelines, a resettlement plan was prepared for the entire\nproject.  Meetings  and  hearings  with  NGOs  were  held;  no  opposition  was  raised  against  the\nProject. The resettlement plan, which is acceptable to ADB and the Government, is summarized\nin Appendix 15.\n\n101. Most  of  the  land  required  for  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road  was  acquired  by  the\nGovernment  more  than  10  years  ago,  for  the  Arun  III  access  road.  The  overall  Project  is\nexpected  to  affect  329  households.  The  Project  may  require  relocation  of  a  total  of  37\nhouseholds  with  houses/shops  and  take  approximately  3.0  ha  of  land.  In  addition,  some  200\nfarmers may be affected by loss of crops along the Basantpur-Khandbari road; 92 farmers will\nrequire  compensation  for  land.  The  estimated  cost  for  compensation  including  implementation\nand monitoring is less than $500,000.\n\n102. During project implementation, the detailed design will be finalized and the exact number\nof  households  that  will  be  affected  within  the  6.5  m  corridor  of  impact  of  each  road  will  be\nidentified. A detailed inventory of losses and a socioeconomic survey will be conducted of actual\naffected persons, and the resettlement plan will be updated.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n103.\nThe  economic  analysis  presented  in  Appendix  16  was  prepared  in  accordance  with\nADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  highway  and  design  and\nmaintenance model, adjusted for conditions in Nepal, is used to calculate vehicle operating cost\nsavings.  The  main  inputs  to  this  are  vehicle  operating  cost  parameters,  and  construction  and\nmaintenance costs. The feeder-road construction component, the construction of the Basantpur-\nKhandbari road, required a different approach to estimate benefits to be derived from providing\nthe new road link. The two major benefits defined were the incremental benefits resulting from\nincreased agricultural production and transport user cost savings including passenger time.\n\n104. Each of the project roads and the Project as a whole were evaluated up to and including\n2025,  providing  benefit  periods  of  19.5  to  20.5  years  depending  on  the  timing  of  the\nimplementation of each road. A residual value is applied in 2025, except for the overlay works\non the EWH.  For upgrading works and new construction, a residual value of 50 percent of the\nconstruction cost has been applied. This is a higher value than is usually used for road projects,\nbut is considered appropriate because of the extensive earth and other works involved that will\nhave  a  substantial  economic  value  beyond  the  end  of  the  evaluation  period.  To  not  include\nresidual values would bias the results against such projects but the impact on results is small.\nThe economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) would be reduced by about 1 percent if residual\nvalues in the more usual range of 20-25 percent are used.\n\n105.\nFor existing roads, base-year traffic estimates use traffic counts, while traffic for the new\nconstruction component is estimated as the equivalent number of vehicles required to transport\n\n\f24\n\nthe  goods  and  people  currently  being  carried  by  porters  or  moving  by  foot.  For  the  existing\nroads, traffic growth rates are based on an analysis of gross domestic product and the income\nelasticity of transport demand for freight traffic. These rates range from 7.1 percent per annum\nin the near term to 4.7 percent in the later years of the evaluation. For the new construction, a\ntraffic  growth  rate  of  4  percent  is  assumed  over  the  evaluation  period.  In  1999,  traffic  on  the\nEWH averaged 1,170 vpd, and for the existing feeder roads ranged from 50 to 156 vpd. Traffic\nthat  would  use  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road  after  construction  is  estimated  at  119  vpd.  No\ngenerated traffic is assumed for the EWH, but for the existing feeder roads is estimated at 30\npercent for cars and utility vehicles and 15 percent for buses. Diverted traffic is not estimated,\nas none of the roads would attract traffic from another road or mode of transport.\n\nIn the case of the Pouwa Bhanjyang road,31 however, traffic generation is assumed once\n106.\nthe road is improved. The assumption is based on traffic counts carried out on the contiguous\nimproved  section  of  the  Ilam-Phidim  road  in  March  2001,32  which  provide  a  plausible  result  of\nabout three times traffic volume higher than expected. Much of the increase on the road was in\nthe  form  of  shared  taxi  services,  which  did  not  operate  before  the  road  was  sealed.  Bus\nfrequency also increased as did truck traffic.\n\n107.\nThe  Pouwa  Bhanjyang-Phidim  road  is  in  Panchtar  district.  It  is  a  tea,  potato,  and  milk-\nproducing area, but the very bad condition of the road constrains transport of the produce out of\nthe  area.  Experience  shows  that  agriculture  development  may  result  from  road  development\nwithout much additional assistance. Improved roads will allow vehicles to carry agriculture and\nfarming  goods  and  will  encourage  more  production.  Therefore  to  better  reflect  the  potential\ntraffic increase in the area, an updated economic analysis was done for the Pouwa Bhanjyang-\nPhidim road, assuming a 125 percent increase in traffic after completion.\n\n108. Road  standards  are  appropriate  for  the  traffic  and  are  considered  to  be  cost-effective.\nThe EWH will be overlayed over a 140 km length at a typical width of 10.5 m including paved\nshoulder.  The  feeder  roads  in  hill  areas  will  have  a  4.5  m  carriageway  width  including  paved\nshoulders,  while  the  terai  feeder  roads  will  have  a  7.5  m  width  including  a  4.0  m  paved\ncarriageway. In the case of the upgrading of hill roads where EIRRs are low, a lower-cost gravel\nstandard  was  considered.  Because  the  terrain  and  climate  conditions  of  the  hill  areas  make\nmaintenance of gravel roads difficult, the alternative option tested was a gravel road with sealing\nof steep grade sections.  These produce lower EIRRs than the all-sealed standard because the\nlower  road  user  savings  and  higher  maintenance  costs  reduce  benefits  more  than  the  cost\nsavings. Costs are based on preliminary engineering and unit costs typical of the location of the\nroad.  Financial  costs  are  converted  to  economic  costs  using  a  standard  conversion  factor  of\n0.88.\n\n109. EIRRs  for  each  component  of  the  Project  are  given  in  Table  3.  All  of  the  roads  are\nfeasible for the recommended improvement based on quantified benefits.\n\n110.\nThe results of the sensitivity tests vary. For the road improvement component, a 1-year\ndelay in obtaining benefits as a result of delayed completion reduces the viability of the roads. A\nslightly  larger  impact  occurs  with  either  a  20  percent  increase  in  construction  costs  or  a  20\npercent  reduction  in  benefits.  Excluding  passenger  time-savings  has  a  higher  negative  impact\non  viability.  The  EIRRs  for  all  the  other  hill  road  projects  fall  to  close  to  12  percent  or  less.\n\n                  \n\n31 Pouwa-Bhanjyang  (24  km)  road  is  the  last  section  of  Ilam-Phidim  road,  canceled  from  the  previous  ADB-TRIP\n\nbecause of a shortage of funds.\n\n32 DOR. 2001. Third Road Improvement Project, Project Completion Report. Kathmandu.\n\n\f25\n\nReducing traffic growth by 50 percent causes major reductions in benefit levels in the later years\nof the evaluation period, but the impact on EIRRs is generally only a little larger than that of the\nother tests.  However in the case of the roads with the lowest rates of return, this impact is very\nsignificant.  The switching values for the overall Project are 165 percent higher for costs and 86\npercent lower for benefits.\n\nTable 3: EIRRs for Subprojects\n\nSubproject\n\nEIRR (%)\n\nBelbari-Chuharwa (140 km)\nBiratnagar-Bardanga (39 km)\nUrlabari-Bardanga (28 km)\nDamak-Gauriganj (22 km)\nDolalghat-Chautara(25 km)\nHile-Basantpur (26 km)\nPouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim (24 km)\nBasantpur-Khandbari (96 km)\n\n33.0\n19.2\n25.1\n27.2\n13.1\n16.3\n12.1\n14.7\n\nSource:  TA  2969-NEP:  Fourth  Road  Improvement  Project,  and\nconsultant and staff estimates.\n\nFor  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road,  increasing  costs,  reducing  producer  surplus,  and\n111.\ndecreasing benefits by 20 percent each cause the EIRR to decrease to close to 12 percent. The\nswitching  values  for  this  road  are  a  26  percent  increase  in  costs  and  21  percent  decrease  in\nbenefits.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n112.\nIn  the  hill  areas,  improvement  of  roadside  and  crossroad  drainage,  included  as  part  of\nthe road works, will have a positive effect on managing storm-water flow and stabilizing slopes\ndisturbed  by  the  initial  construction.  The  Project  will  include  extensive  off-road  bioengineering\nworks  aimed  at  revegetating  and  stabilizing  slopes  disturbed  by  construction.  New  road\nconstruction, for the Basantpur-Khandbari road, will be implemented using environment-friendly\nmethods,  with  maximal  manual  earthworks,  and  sufficient  phased  development  to  minimize\ndisturbance to areas that are unstable and prone to slides.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nSocial Impact\n\n113.\nThe  social  dimensions  of  the  Project  (the  poverty  intervention  and  ethnic  minority\ndevelopment  plan,  the  resettlement  plan,  contract  specifications  for  protecting  children  from\nconstruction labor, and stakeholder participation and consultation) are all designed to facilitate\nmore  equitable  and  sustainable  distribution  of  benefits  particularly  for  the  poorest  and  socially\nexcluded in the project areas.\n\n114.\nThe Project recognizes that direct harm as well as indirect adverse social impacts may\nresult  from  the  development.  These  potential  adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by  the  Project\nthrough  complementary  activities \nincluding  (i)  participatory  development  and  effective\nimplementation  of  a  resettlement  plan  for  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of\npeople  affected  by  land  acquisition  for  the  Project;  (ii)  awareness  raising  of  alternative  work\nopportunities;  (iii)  awareness  raising  of  social  damage  resulting  from  undesirable  social\n\n\f26\n\npractices, and (iv) awareness raising about migrant labor and prioritizing the use of local labor in\nroad building groups. The resettlement plan will be implemented in conjunction with the poverty\nintervention component.\n\n115. No  specific  ethnic  or  caste  groups  will  be  especially  adversely  affected.  Many\nindigenous, tribal, and caste groups live within the project area, particularly in the hill areas, but\nthey will not be disadvantaged or vulnerable because of their social or cultural identity. In fact,\nthe  poverty  intervention  component  is  targeted  specifically  at  all  poor  and  socially  excluded\ncommunities  and  groups,  regardless  of  ethnicity  or  caste  living  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project\nroads.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  special  needs  along  project  roads  to  be  identified\nthrough participatory stakeholder analysis.\n\n2. \n\nBeneficiaries\n\n116.\nThe Project will benefit communities within the project corridor as well as communities in\nthe  hinterlands  that  will  have  improved  access  to  the  project  roads.  Improvement  of  the  EWH\nwill benefit private traders and other industries along the influenced corridors that will be able to\nexpand due to more efficient road transport, and the people who will obtain increased incomes\nand  employment  opportunities,  including  the  poor.  The  beneficiaries  of  improved  feeder  and\ndistrict  roads  will  be  the  farmers  and  other  affected  communities,  where  poverty  incidence  is\nhigher  than  the  national  level.  Production  and  quality  of  life  are  expected  to  increase  due  to\nmore accessible roads.\n\n117. Population  in  the  zone  of  influence  of  the  roads  will  enjoy  faster  and  lower-cost  bus\ntransport. Presently, bus fares on highways generally average less than NRs1.0 per km, while\non  poor  condition  feeder  roads  the  fare  can  exceed  NRs3.0  per  km.  Improved  access  and\nincreased competition should result in lower fares and more frequent travel by the population.\n\nThe  use  of  competitive  tendering  process  will  provide  opportunities  for  local  consulting\n118.\nand construction firms to participate in implementation. Furthermore, the PBM contracts should\nalso  help  to  strengthen  the  private  sector  by  creating  more  jobs  and  providing  continuous\ncontracts  for  maintenance.  The  road  maintenance  component,  together  with  the  road  safety\ncomponent will benefit road users and pedestrians throughout the country.\n\nD. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nThe economic impacts of the Project include: reduced vehicle operating costs, increased\n119.\naccess  to  markets,  lower  prices,  better  marketing  opportunities,  and  more  employment\nopportunities  including  construction  and  maintenance  of  project  roads,  all  leading  to  a  higher\nGDP  growth  rate.    Without  the  basic  road  infrastructure,  health,  markets,  and  educational\nservices, which are presently inaccessible in much of the project area, will be difficult to access.\nWhile most direct benefits are in the form of reduced transport costs, the profits of farmers and\nsaving  by  consumers  will  be  more  equally  shared  among  the  poor.  The  summary  poverty\nassessment is attached as Appendix 17.\n\n120.\nIn 2000, approximately 1.1 million people were living in the project area, of which around\n41.2  percent  were  poor.  The  Project  is  expected  to  directly  benefit  about  745,932  people  (70\npercent of the total population), of whom 351,835 (47.2 percent) are poor, by improving access\nto valued goods and services. The Project will also indirectly benefit about 319,685 people (30\npercent of total), of whom 150,787 are poor. The Project will have a positive poverty reduction\n\n\f27\n\nimpact on the poor in the project area by generating income opportunities because of road and\naccess construction and related livelihood improvements.\n\n121.\nThe  Project  has  the  potential  to  generate  job  opportunities  for  approximately  1,000\nunskilled  laborers  and  500  skilled  laborers  to  supplement  their  earnings  through  road\nconstruction along the roads to be improved. In addition, approximately 2,000 unskilled laborers\nwill be needed for the labor-based construction of the Hile-Basantpur and Basantpur-Khandbari\nroads.\n\n122.\nThe Project will support pro-poor economic growth by improving transport efficiency that\nwill  support  domestic  trade  and  cross-border  transport,  which  will  generate  increases  in\nemployment  including  for  the  poor.  This  will  also  be  a  poverty  intervention  project,  since  the\nproportion  of  the  poor  among  the  project  beneficiaries  is  larger  than  their  proportion  in  the\noverall  population  of  the  country.  The  PBM  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  targeted  to\ndistricts  with  a  high  incidence  of  poverty.  The  poverty  intervention  component  of  the  Project,\ncomplemented  by  DFID's  rural  access  program  will  enhance  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction\nefforts.\n\n123.\nThe benefit distribution analysis was carried out and poverty reduction impact ratio was\ncalculated  for  representative  roads  of  the  Project.  The  results  suggest  that  40  percent  of  the\nusers of the project roads are poor. About 75 percent of bus users are poor, and 20 percent of\nother vehicle users are poor. The poverty impact ratio of the hill roads is more than 100 percent,\n55 percent for the terai roads, and 33 percent for the EWH, indicating the percentage of the net\nproject benefits reaching poor users.\n\nE. \n\nRisks\n\n124.\nThe  Project  has  been  carefully  formulated  to  positively  manage  and  mitigate  risks.\nAdvance  action  will  help  expedite  consultant  recruitment  for  detailed  design  and  construction\nsupervision.  The  project  management  unit,  including  four  project  managers,  was  established\nprior  to  loan  negotiations.  The  risk  of  inadequate  counterpart  funding  has  been  addressed  by\ngaining Government commitment to include the Project in its core projects starting in FY2001/02\nto  ensure  that  the  budget  allocations  for  the  Project  will  be  protected.  Furthermore,  the\nGovernment has provided an adequate allocation for the Project in its FY2001/02 budget, which\nreflects  the  Government's  commitment  to  ensuring  adequate  local  counterpart  funds  for  the\nProject.\n\n125. General  risks  for  project  implementation  arise  from  the  high  uncertainty  in  the  political\nsituation  and  adverse  macroeconomic  conditions.  Complementary  interventions  have  been\nformulated to ensure that local communities will gain the project benefits. A specific geographic\ncondition  of  Nepal  as  a  landlocked  country  with  landslide-prone  areas  also  needs  to  be  taken\ninto account. All those problems may delay the implementation and affect the actual costs of the\nimplementation \nthe  project  scope.  Therefore,  a  sufficient\nimplementation period and contingencies have been provided under the Project to mitigate the\nrisks.\n\nreduction  of \n\nresulting \n\nin \n\n126.   The remaining risks arise from the use of local contractors to carry out most of the civil\nworks. Concerns about their limited managerial, financial, and equipment resources have been\nsuccessfully addressed under the TRIP. The Project will continue the approaches of (i) carefully\nselecting  contractors  based  upon  their  resources  and  experience  with  road  construction;  (ii)\nproviding substantial assistance to contractors by having the project consultant impart practical\n\n\f28\n\nday-to-day  management  and  technical  advice;  (iii)  procuring  the  works  in  relatively  small\npackages and in two stages, so that the failure of one contractor will not have a major impact on\nthe  remainder  of  the  Project;  and  (iv)  ensuring  the  Government's  commitment  to  promote  a\nviable and efficient private sector contracting industry for road construction, improvement, and\nmaintenance works.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n127.\nprovisions which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Borrower  will  ensure \nthe\nresettlement  plan  agreed  to  by  the  Borrower  and  ADB  is  implemented  by  DOR\nunder  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s  Handbook on Resettlement,  as  amended\nfrom time to time. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement will be borne by\nthe Borrower.\n\nthat \n\nEnvironmental Management. The Government will ensure that all environmental\nmitigation  measures  identified  in  the  EIA  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design\nand  followed  during  project  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance,  in\nconsultation with the Ministry of Population and Environment and in accordance\nwith  ADB's  environmental  guidelines  and  the  environmental  management  plan\nagreed to with ADB. Monitoring will be carried out in accordance with the project\nperformance  monitoring  system  (Appendix  14)  and  will  be  reported  by  DOR  to\nADB through the progress reports on project implementation, and an evaluation\nreport one year after completion of construction.\n\nOperation  and  Maintenance.  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance  of  the  project  roads  through  proper  technical  supervision  and\nadequate  allocation  of  funds.  Loan  proceeds  set  aside  under  the  Project  for\nroutine  and  recurrent  maintenance  on  selected  subprojects  for  the  SRN  will  be\napplied  through  the  first  year  of  the  PBM  component,  to  be  selected  in\naccordance  with  the  ARMP.  DOR  will  continue  to  supervise  the  implementation\nof PBM and financing through the proposed road fund.\n\nHealth  Risks.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  reflect\nthe  need  for  an  information  and  education  campaign  by  the  contractor  on\nsexually  transmitted  diseases  and  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired\nimmunodeficiency  syndrome  for  construction  workers  as  part  of  the  health  and\nsafety program at campsites during the construction period.\n\nCounterpart  Funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  and  adequate\nprovision of counterpart funds for the Project.\n\nAxle-Load  Control.  The  Government  will  establish  and  implement  a  pragmatic\nand enforceable heavy vehicle management policy, acceptable to all concerned\nagencies such as MPPW, DOR, MPPW's Legal Section, and DOTM, as well as\ntransport service organizations and Nepal Traffic Police by the end of 2002. The\n\n\f29\n\nGovernment  will  amend  the  Vehicle  and  Transport  Management  Act  to\nincorporate  an  appropriate  penalty  structure  sufficient  to  act  as  a  deterrent  to\npotential  violators.  Sufficient  enforcement  staff  will  be  recruited  and  necessary\nequipment  for  the  heavy  vehicle  control  will  be  procured.  DOR  will  set  up  axle-\nload  control  stations  at  appropriate  locations,  and  will  provide  regular  reports\n(quarterly)  to  ADB  on  the  status  of  load  enforcement  measures,  incidence  of\nvehicle overloading, and other benchmarks that are consistent with the policy.\n\n(vii) \n\nLabor Laws. The Government will ensure that the civil works contractors comply\nwith  all  applicable  labor  laws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and\nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate \nin\nconstruction campsites. The Government will set employment targets for women\nfor road construction activities, as well as require contractors not to differentiate\nwages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  A  specific  clause  will\nbe  included  in  bidding  documents,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored\nduring project implementation.\n\nfor  children \n\nfacilities \n\n(viii)  Financial  Administration  Regulations.  The  Government  will  approve  the  Public\nWorks  Directives  prepared  under  TA  3306-NEP  (footnote  17)  as  appropriate  to\nthe Government, and amend the regulations accordingly.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Award of Contracts\n\nThe  Government  will  not  award  any  civil  works  contract  until  after  acquiring  or  making\n\n128.\navailable, the land and rights of land, free of encumbrances, required to execute the contract.\n\n129.\nFor the  PBM  component,  the Government will not award any contract until after (i) the\nRoad  Board  Bill  is  tabled  in  Parliament,  and  (ii)  the  roads  selected  for  maintenance  have  met\nthe selection criteria set out in Appendix 8, and ADB concurrence obtained.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n130.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 35,686,000 to\nthe Kingdom of Nepal for the Road Network Development Project, with a term of\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the\nBoard; and\n\nADB administering a grant assistance in the amount of \u00a37,064,000 equivalent to\nbe  provided  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the\nUnited  Kingdom  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Road  Network  Development\nProject.\n\n07 November 2001\n\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n\n\f30\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\nRoad Network and Road Density\n\n4, 15 and 16\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nProject Framework\n\nOrganization Charts\n\nRegistered Motor Vehicles\n\nRoad Sector Expenditure and Revenue\n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Subsector\n\nSummary of Design and Technical Approach\n\nPerformance-Based Maintenance by Contract\n\nSummary Poverty Intervention and Ethnic Minority\nDevelopment Plan\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nSummary Implementation Schedule\n\nIndicative Contract Packages\n\nConsulting Services for the Design and Supervision\nOutline Terms of Reference\n\nOutline Project Performance Management System\n\nSummary Resettlement Plan\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nSummary Poverty Impact Assessment\n\n31\n\n33\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n41\n\n45\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n56\n\n58\n\n64\n\n70\n\n2, 6\n\n 3, 13\n\n4, 18\n\n5, 23\n\n6, 26\n\n15, 65\n\n16, 69\n\n17, 76\n\n17, 77\n\n20, 83\n\n20, 84\n\n20, 88\n\n21, 95\n\n23, 100\n\n23, 103\n\n26, 119\n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Indicators/Targets\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nAssumptions and Risks\n\nA.

The  existing  feeder  and  district  roads  consist  of  bituminous,  gravel,  and\nearth/rock  surfaces  and  are  in  bad  conditions;  they  need  to  be  improved  to  maintainable\nstandards of all-weather bitumen feeder roads. Some structures will also require refurbishment\nand  replacement.  The  Basantpur\u2013Khandbari  road  has  been  opened  up  to  tracks  and  earthen\nsurface  for  some  50  km,  and  will  be  newly  constructed  to  feeder  road  tracks,  earthen,  and\neventually all-weather gravel standard.\n\n3.\nThe  Road  Design  Standard  of  the  Department  of  Road  (DOR)  for  National  Highways\nand Feeder Roads (1997) will be used with necessary modifications, consistent with the United\nKingdom  Overseas  Road  Note  31  and  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and\nTransportation Officials (AASHTO) Design Standards.\n\nB.\n\nDesign Standards\n\n4.\nTraffic counts were taken during the feasibility study, and projections were developed for\nthe 20-year project design period. These projections, together with terrain conditions, were used\nto  determine  physical  capacity  requirements.  These  roads  pass  through  different  kinds  of\nterrain, from nearly flat to rolling and mountainous.\n\n5.\nDesign speed in the flat terrain is 60-80 km per hour (kph); this will decrease to 40-60\nkph and 20-40 kph in the rolling and mountainous terrain respectively. The carriageway widths\nvarying from 7 meters (m) for the EWH to 3.5 m for feeder and district roads with tighter width\nstandards in mountainous terrain. Provision of extra widths will be made at every km stone to\nallow some bigger vehicles to pass. On the road stretches through villages, markets, and other\ncongested areas, extra carriageway width will also be provided.\n\n6.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  generally  within  the  existing  formation  width.  Some\nsections  of  the  project  road  will  require  realignments  to  improve  road  safety  and  capacity.\nMinimum  land  clearance,  cut  and  fill,  reduction  of  resettlement  impacts  as  well  as  cost-\neffectiveness  will  be  taken  into  account  for  realignments.  Construction  inside  the  existing\ncleared  roadway  width  should  be  maximized  when  the  road  sections  pass  any  environment-\nsensitive or mountainous areas. The requirement for additional rock cut of side slopes should be\nminimized (plant cover maintained). In areas of unstable soils side slopes should be benched as\nappropriate.\n\n\f9.\nA7.\n\nRoad Section\n\n(Length)\n\n40\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\n7.\nPavements have been designed in accordance with international practice for a 5-10 year\nlife, with provision for overlay or regraveling during or at the end of that period to extend the life\nto  10-15  years.  The  designs  are  based  on  projected  traffic,  axle  loads,  existing  pavement\nstructure,  subgrade  California  Bearing  Ratio  (CBR),  and  quality  of  materials  available.  For  the\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari  road,  provision  of  higher  standard  of  pavement  will  be  made  when  the\nroads  pass  through  mountainous  terrain  (gradient  more  than  5  percent),  villages,  and  district\nareas.\n\nBridges  and  drainage  structures  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  acceptable\n\n8.\ninternational standards.\n\nThe indicative cross sections and pavement structures for each road are shown in Table\n\nTable A7: Indicative Cross Section and Pavement Structure\n\nFlat & Flat-Rolling\n\nMountainous\n\nCarriageway\nWidth (m)/\nType\n\nShoulder\nWidth (m)/\nType\n\nCarriageway\nWidth (m)/\nType\n\nShoulder\nWidth (m)/\nType\n\nBelbari\u2013Chuharwa (140 km)\n\n7.0 / AC\n\nBiratnagar\u2013Bardanga (39 km)\n\nUrlabari\u2013Bardanga (28 km)\n\n3.5 / DBST\n\nDamak\u2013Gauriganj (22 km)\n\nDolalghat\u2013Chautara (25 km)\n\nPouwa Bhanjyang\u2013Phidim (24 km)\n\nHile\u2013Basantpur (26 km)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n2 x 1.75 /\nDBST\n\n2 x 2.0 /\nSBST\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n3.5 / DBST\n\n2 x 0.5 /\nSBST\n\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari (96 km)\n\n4.5 / gravel\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014  =  not  aplicable,  AC  =  aggregate  concrete,  DBST  =  double  bitumen  surface  treatment,  SBST  =  single  bitumen\nsurface treatment.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 8, page 1\n\nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE BY CONTRACT\n\nA. \n\nConcept\n\n1.\nA  performance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contract  is  an  agreement  between  a\ngovernment department or state enterprise and a private contractor whereby the private\ncontractor  maintains  the  road  to  achieve  specified  condition  standards  for  a  certain\nperiod  of  time  (usually  long-term,  ranging  from  3  to  10  years)  in  return  for  a  fixed\npayment stream.\n\n2.\nThe  concept  of  PBM  contracts  originated  from  a  consideration  of  (i)  the\nincreasing  lack  of  personnel  within  the  government  road  departments  available  to\nmeasure  the  vast  quantities  of  activities  involved  in  the  more  traditional  maintenance\ncontracts,  and  to  monitor  performance  standards  using  inputs  indicators;  (ii)  the\nfrequency of claims resulting from the necessity to increase the quantities of activities of\nthe original contracts; (iii) the need to focus more on customer satisfaction; and (iv) the\nneed  to  shift  greater  responsibility  to  contractors  throughout  the  entire  contract  period,\nas well as to stimulate and profit from their innovative capabilities.1\n\nThe  PBM  contract  is  different  from  a  traditional  quantity  and  unit-price-based,\n3.\nshort-term maintenance contract. Under the traditional maintenance contract, the private\nsector  maintains  an  existing  road  based  on  input  indicators,  such  as  materials,\nequipment, and labor, or more frequently, tons of pothole patch material used, number of\nlinear  meters  of  pipe  culverts  replaced,  and  number  of  square  meters  of  crack  sealed.\nUnder the PBM contracts, the private sector maintains an existing road on the basis of\ncustomer-based  performance \nriding  and  strength  quality\nindicators,  such  as \n(smoothness), safety features, and aesthetics and attractiveness of roadside.\n\n4.\nThe  PBM  contract  is  also  different  from  an  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)\nconcession.  Under  the  PBM  contract,  performance  risks  are  allocated  between  the\ngovernment/client  and  the  contractor.  However,  the  traffic  risk  remains  with  the\ngovernment.  Under  the  O&M  concession,  the  concessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  and,\nultimately,  the  revenue  risks.  The  concessionaire  collects  the  toll,  maintains  the  road,\nand  pays  an  agreed-upon  amount  to  the  government.  Since  the  risk  from  uncertain\ntraffic  is  to  be  borne  by  private  sector,  the  O&M  concession  is  only  suitable  for  roads\nwith  sufficient  traffic  volume.  For  low-volume  roads,  the  PBM  contracts  may  prove  a\npromising alternative modality for private sector participation in the road sector.\n\n5.\nThe PBM is especially suitable for low-volume roads with gravel surface or thin\nbituminous  surface  treatments  as  the  continued  serviceability  of  such  roads  depends\nentirely on the quality and reliability of future maintenance. It offers an effective means to\nimprove  the  efficiency  and  public  accountability  of  road  maintenance  operations.  Other\nbenefits  include  improved  service  to  road  users,  reliable  and  secure  funding  for  road\nmaintenance, and reduced size of the government establishment (staff, equipment, and\nbuildings) needed for road maintenance operations. In the long run, this approach could\nsignificantly reduce the unit cost of maintenance operations while improving the quality\nand cost-effectiveness of maintenance works.\n                                                          \n1 Cabana, G, Liautaud, G and Faiz, A. 1999.

These  standards  should  be  defined  with  the  aim  of\nminimizing  the  long-term  cost  of  preserving  the  road,  as  well  as  the  cost  to  the  road\nuser.

PBM  contracts\nshould have well-defined monitoring procedures. Inspectors may be hired to inspect the\nroad  and  make  random  checks  regularly  to  verify  compliance.  A  well-documented\ninventory of the road, as well as daily records of activities undertaken by the contractor\nwill  help  understand  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  roads  and  contribute  to  better\npreventive maintenance. Road users may also be encouraged to take an important role\nin  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road  deficiencies  to  the  road  agency.  A\npercentage of noncompliance may be calculated based on a formula incorporated in the\ncontract, by which penalties are applied.\n\nC. \n\nBidding Processes\n\n8.\nThe  guiding  principle  for  bidding  processes  should  be  to  maximize  competition\nand  clarity  in  the  process.  The  major  aspects  that  should  be  considered  to  ensure\ncompetitive and transparent bidding processes are as follows:\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDetailed  development  of  the  contract  should  be  set  out  clearly  in  the\nbidding  documents,  specifying  the  responsibilities  of  the  contractor  and\nthe government.\n\nA  draft  contract  agreement  should  be  prepared  by  the  government  and\nincluded in the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar\nassumptions.\n\nThe evaluation criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents.\nThe most transparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the\nlowest  level  of  bid  price  for  a  given  performance  specification.  The\ndecision  should  be  made  only  after  prequalification  procedures  where\npotential  bidders  are  evaluated  in  terms  of  their  technical,  operational,\nand financial capacity.\n\nD. \n\nCriteria for Selecting Performance-based Maintenance Subprojects\n\n9.\nThe PBM component will finance a program of road maintenance of roads under\nDepartment  of  Road  (DOR)  responsibility  from  DOR's  Annual  Road  Maintenance\nProgram  (ARMP).  This  will  be  divided  in  four  contracts  to  be  implemented  over  four\nyears,  taking  into  account  prior  consulting  services  for  preparing  the  program.  Each\ncontract will cover civil works of about $1.0 million in value, providing for maintenance for\nabout 100-300 kilometers (km) of roads.\n\n10.\nRoads  to  be  included  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB).  Roads  will  be  selected  in  order  of  estimated  economic  returns,  based  on\nthe  rankings  produced  by  the  latest  ARMP,2  and  subject  to  the  following  criteria.  For\nroads  satisfying  the  criteria,  preference  will  be  given  to  roads  that  were  previously\nimproved under ADB assistance. The criteria for selecting subprojects for inclusion in the\nPBM program are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  roads  are  included  in  DOR's  ARMP  and  have  been  identified  as\npriority maintenance tasks.\n\nThe  roads  are  located  within  geographic  areas  of  concentration  to  be\nselected by DOR and approved by ADB.\n\nThe  geographic  areas  of  concentration  will  be  confined  to  districts  with\nrates of poverty equal to or above the national average, according to the\nlatest official estimates of poverty in Nepal.\n\nThe  proposed  civil  works  will  be  limited  to  preventive  works,  catch-up\nroutine  maintenance,  and  performance  maintenance.

Poverty, and particularly social exclusion, are\nclosely  linked  in  Nepal  to  caste  and  ethnicity.  It  is  the  highest  in  remote  hilly  and  mountain\ndistricts.  The  hill  tribes  and  occupational  castes  have  the  highest  levels  of  poverty,  with  the\noccupational  castes  having  the  lowest  average  incomes.  The  poverty  intervention  will  be\ntargeted to the rural poor and disadvantaged groups, mostly ethnic minority groups. Hence, an\nintegrated poverty intervention and ethnic minority development plan (PIEMDP) was prepared.\nThe plan draws particular attention to the complementarily of road improvement with the social\ndevelopment intervention by Department for International Development (DFID) under its Rural\nAccess Program (RAP) in Hile-Basantpur and Basantpur-Khandbari areas.\n\nThe  objective  of  the  PIEMDP  is  to  ensure  that  the  Project  will  mitigate  any  adverse\n2.\nimpacts  upon  minority  groups  and  communities,  and  provide  them  with  opportunities  to\nparticipate  in  and  benefit  equally  from  the  Project's  interventions.  More  specifically,  the\nobjective is to reduce poverty by (i) ensuring the poor and socially excluded are able to take\nadvantage  of  social  and  economic  opportunities  arising  from  improved  access;  and  (ii)\nimproving  rural  accessibility  for  the  poor  and  excluded  in  the  project  area  by  constructing\ntracks,  trails,  footpaths,  pedestrian  bridges,  bus  station/stops,  and  markets  at  community-\nselected locations to meet their domestic, economic, and social needs.\n\nB.\n\nEthnic Minority Groups and Related Policy\n\n3.\nThe  Constitution  is  the  fundamental  law  of  Nepal.  It  declares  Nepal  a  multiethnic,\nmultilingual,  democratic,  independent,  indivisible,  sovereign,  and  constitutional  monarchial\nkingdom. Basic human rights are granted to every citizen. Additional safeguards noted in the\nConstitution  include  the  right  to  own  property;  the  right  to  conserve  and  promote  one's\nlanguage,  script,  and  culture;  the  right  to  be  educated  in  one's  mother  tongue;  freedom  of\nreligion; and the right to manage and protect religious places and trusts.\n\n4.\nThe  Government\u2019s  current  five-year  development  plan  values  target  group-based\nprogram  interventions  as  the  preferred  method  to  reach  groups  and  areas  suffering  from\npoverty.  Targeted  group  programs  attempt  to  address  regional  disparities,  gender  concerns,\nand  marginalized  groups  by  specifically  identifying  groups  such  as  janajati  (indigenous  and\nethnic  groups), dalit  (people  facing  discrimination  due  to  caste), kamaiya  (bonded  laborers),\nsukumbasi (landless  in-migrants),  marginalized  farmers  and  the  landless,  disabled  people,\nsenior citizens, women, and children.\n\n5.\nIn  1999  the  combined  population  of  the  project  area  was  more  than  1  million.  The\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Newar groups (BCNs) dominate on the terai, with considerable populations\nof occupational castes and some migrant hill tribes. The hill tribes, with some incursions of the\nBCNs, dominate the hill areas in the east. The BCNs dominate in the Central region hill roads\nwith significant occupational caste groups as they do in the Far Western hill roads. Table A9.1\nidentifies the majority and minority ethnic and caste groups in the project area.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nTable A9.1: Majority and Minority Ethnic and Caste Groups\n\nRoad Section\n\nMajority Caste or Tribal Group\n\nMinority Ethnic Groups\n\nPouwa Bhanjyang -\nPhidim\n\nUrlabari - Bardanga\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Magar, Rai,\nTamang\n\nDamai, Kami, Limbu, Newar,\nSherpa\n\nDhimal, Limbu, Newar, Rai,\nSherpa\n\nMagar, Marwadi, Musahar,\nRajbansi, Satar, Tamang\n\nBiratnagar - Bardanga\n\nBrahmin, Kamat, Marwadi,\nMusahar, Rajbansi, Satar\n\nBaniya Kami, Chhetri, Choudhari,\nDamai, Limbu, Magar Rai, Malala\nSatar, Newar, Sahani, Yadev\n\nDamak - Gauriganj\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Limbu, Rai,\nRajbansi\n\nDamai, Dusadh, Gurung, Kami,\nMalar, Newar, Sami, Satar, Tamang\n\nDolalghat - Chautara\n\nDamai, Giri, Kami, Maji, Thakuri\n\nEWH:\nBelbari - Chuharwa\n\nHile - Basantpur\n\nGurung Damai, Kami, Sarki,\nTamang\n\nBhote, Damai, Kami, Sarki\n\nBasantpur - Khandbari\n\nBhote, Damai, Kami, Kumal, Sarki\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Newar,\nTamang\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Limbu,\nMagar, Newar, Rai\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Gurung,\nLimbu, Newar, Rai, Tamang\n\nBrahmin, Chhetri, Gurung,\nLimbu, Newar, Rai, Tamang\n\nC.\n\n6.\n\nDevelopment and Mitigation Activities\n\nThe PIEMDP will include two types of interventions:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPhysical interventions: providing access from community centers to the nearest\nmotorable  road  by  building  or  improving  footpaths,  pedestrian  bridges,  tracks,\nand bus stops; and improving community facilities such as markets.\n\nSocial development interventions: Protecting interventions target those likely to\nbe  adversely  affected,  and  include  support  to  local  communities  to  resolve\nissues such as compensation. Enabling interventions include rights awareness\nraising;  training  in  communication,  leadership,  advocacy,  and  negotiation  so\nthat rights can be exercised; and training in savings group formation. Enhancing\ninterventions  provide  information  on  income  generating  opportunities,  promote\nestablishment of revolving funds for community groups, and link with marketing\norganizations to promote increased trade.1\n\nD.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n7.\nThe physical interventions will be identified, planned, implemented, and operated by the\ncommunity  groups  through  the  social  development  interventions.  The  implementation  of\nphysical  interventions  will  be  financed  and  managed  under  the  Project.  In  parallel,  the  social\ndevelopment  interventions  for  the  Hile-Basantpur  and  Basantpur-Khandbari  roads  will  be\nmanaged  and  financed  by  DFID  under  its  RAP.  Therefore,  the  Executing  and  Implementing\nagencies,  and  the  design  and  supervision  consultants  of  the  Project  must  work  in  close\n\n                                                     \n1  DFID Nepal. 2000.

A separate poverty intervention program for other roads is being\nproposed under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.\n\n8.\nSocial Preparation. The first year of the Project will focus on preparation of the local\ngovernment and people within the zone of influence (ZOI) to participate in and commit to the\nProject's social development component. Local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), with\nthe  use  of  social  mobilizers,  will  assist  local  communities  to  prepare  for  the  Project.\nPreparation will include formation and training of road building groups (RBGs).\n\n9.\nIdentification of Physical Interventions Component. During detailed design, village\nroads,  trails,  and  footbridges  will  be  identified  through  village  consultation  in  response  to\ncommunity needs assessment.\n\n10.\n  Formation  of  Road  Building  Groups.  DFID-RAP  and  the  project  consultants  will\nwork  with  local  NGOs  to  mobilize  RBGs  from  surrounding  communities  to  construct/improve\ndistrict  feeder  road,  trails,  and  bridges.  The  Department  of  Roads  will  manage  small  local\ncontractors to construct the district feeder road.\n\nImplementation  of  Physical  Interventions  Component.  All  construction  will  be\n\n11.\ncarried out using labor-based methods.\n\n12.\nComplementary Support Programs to the RBGs. These programs will include adult\nliteracy,  book-keeping,  resource  mobilization,  savings,  and  credit  opportunities.  Each  RBG\nmember  will  be  encouraged  to  deposit  10  to  20  percent  of  his/her  earnings  from  road\nconstruction in the group saving fund. The social mobilizers will also facilitate on behalf of the\nRBGs  to  identify  what  additional  activities  are  required  to  improve  the  conditions  of  the\ncommunities.  Social  mobilizers  will  facilitate  rights  awareness,  and  women's  empowerment.\nThe program will also seek to help maximize the sustainable enterprise development activities\nand  opportunities  available  to  communities.  Activities  could  include  the  development  of\nfishponds, tree planting, fruit production, piggeries, etc., for communities at large.\n\nE.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n13.\nBaseline  surveys  will  be  established  at  the  start  of  the  programs  for  each  district  to\nmeasure  the  impact  of  interventions;  the  changing  status  and  circumstances  of  individuals,\nhouseholds, and communities; relationships between stakeholders; locally perceived changes\nin households and individual well-being; and institutional change.\n\nLocal  communities  will  be  involved  directly  in  monitoring  and  tracking  changes  in\n14.\nlivelihoods at the local level.  This will also empower the primary stakeholders (facility users,\nand  other \n(community-based\norganizations,  NGOs,  and  local  government)  to  ensure  transparency  and  contribute  to  good\ngovernance.\n\nimmediate  secondary  stakeholders \n\nlocal  groups)  and \n\nF.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  social  development  interventions  will  be  started  in  2002  and  the  physical\n\n15.\ninterventions will be implemented during 2004-2006.\n\n\f4.

A  100  percent  census  and  social  impact  assessment  (SIA)  of  a  sample  of\npotentially  affected  households  was  carried  out  for  the  road  construction  component,  the\nBasantpur-Khandbari  road.    The  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  prepared  based  on  the  ISA  and  SIA\nwill be updated following detailed design based on a full census and inventory of losses.\n\nB.\n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\nThe  detailed  design  will  be  developed  with  a  view  to  minimizing  the  need  for  land\n2. \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  while  taking  into  account  adequate  safety  measures.\nMinimal  land  acquisition  will  be  necessary  for  reshaping  bends  and  reinforcing  road\nembankments.  For  Basantpur-Khandbari,  the  Project  will  keep  all  works  within  a  corridor  of\nimpact of 6.5  meters (m), which is within the 30 m right-of-way (ROW) that was acquired by the\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) in 1989 under the Arun III Hydropower Project. Most households\nwere compensated at that time, and permitted to remain within the ROW until the land would be\nrequired.\n\n3. \nBased on the ISA, SIA and census, 329 households may be affected by land acquisition\nfor the Project, including about 3.0 hectares (ha) of land acquired, about 200 farmers with loss\nof  crops,  and  potential  resettlement  of  37  houses/shops.  Most  of  the  crop  land  is  along  the\nBasantpur-Khandbari  road  for  which  compensation  has  already  been  paid  for  land  but  not  for\ncrops.  In  addition,  every  attempt  will  be  made  to  compensate  92  farmers  who  did  not  receive\ntheir  compensation  when  DOR  acquired  the  ROW  for  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  road.  Table\nA15.1 shows the likely scale of impact.  This will be updated during the detailed design phase.\n\nTable A15.1: Likely Scale of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact\n\n Road Section\n\nPotential Resettlement\n\nLand Take\n(hectares)\n\nPouwa Bhanjyang\u2013Phidim\nBiratnagar\u2013Bardanga\nUlarbari\u2013Bardanga\nDamak\u2013Gaurigunj\nDolalghat\u2013Chautara\nEWH: Belbari\u2013Chuharwa\nHile\u2013Basantpur\nBasantpur\u2013Khandbari\n\nTotal\n\n0.3\n0.5\nNone\nNone\n0.3\nNone\n0.34\n1.92\n\n3.06\n\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n5 shops/houses\nNone\n2 houses\n200 farmers for crops/trees\n30 houses/shops\n\n37 house/shops\n 200 farmers losing crops\n 92 lots to be compensated\n\nSource:   Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). 2001.

Despite its limitations,\nthe main legislation to guide land acquisition in Nepal is the Land Acquisition Act 2034 (1977).\nThe Water and Energy Commission Secretariat is currently taking initiative for the Amendment\nof Land Acquisition Act 2034 with technical assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe RP has been prepared in accordance with the precedents set by the ongoing World Bank-\nassisted Road Maintenance and Development Project and the ADB-assisted Melamchi Water\nSupply Project. The entitlement matrix for the Project is summarized in Table A15.2.\n\nTable A15.2.

This  will  be  effected  retroactively  for  land\nacquired within the ROW from Basantpur to Khandbari.\n\n5.\n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n10.\nThe  ISA  and  SIA  identified  vulnerable  groups  as  the  poor  and  socially  excluded\nincluding  the  many  ethnic  minority  groups  throughout  the  project  areas.  The  PIEMDP  was\nprepared to ensure the poor and minority groups will be able to take advantage of social and\neconomic opportunities arising from improved access provided by the Project.\n\n6.\n\nConsultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism\n\nDuring  the  1998/99  ISA  and  May-June  2001  census/survey,  informal  meetings  were\n11.\nheld  with  all  affected  village  development  committees  and  district  development  committees\nalong the Hile-Basantpur-Khandbari road. In addition, all households within a 10 m corridor of\nimpact  were  interviewed.  Informal  interviews  and  focus  group  discussions  were  also  held\nalong  the  other  road  sections  during  the  feasibility  study  in  1998/99.  Further  public\nconsultation  and  participation  will  be  undertaken  during  resettlement  implementation.  The\ncontents  of  the  RP  and  entitlement  matrix  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people  and\ncommunities,  prior  to  updating  the  RP.  A  grievance  mechanism  is  being  established  for  the\nProject.\n\n7.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\nA  social  development  support  team  will  be  established  within  the  Environment  and\n12.\nSocial  Unit  of  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU),  consisting  of  an  international  social\ndevelopment  specialist  (6  person-months)  and  counterpart  domestic  consultants  (48  person-\nmonths).  Responsibilities  will  include  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the\nupdated  RP;  stakeholder  participation;  information  dissemination;  and  liaison  with  other\ngovernment agencies, and Department for International Development consultants.\n\n13.\nCompensation determination committees will be established in each concerned district\naccording to the provisions of the land acquisition.

Resettlement\nactivities  are  estimated  to  begin  in  April  2002  with  mobilization  of  the  international  social\ndevelopment specialist and end in the last quarter of 2003.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 16, page 1\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nThe  benefit  and  cost  analysis  of  the  proposed  road  strengthening  and\nthe  Highway  Design  and\nimprovement  components  were  prepared  based  on \nMaintenance Model, developed primarily by the World Bank and adjusted for conditions\nin Nepal. Economic evaluation was made by comparing the with project and the without\nproject cases.\n\n2.\nThe new construction of the Basantpur-Khandbari component required a different\napproach to estimating benefits to be derived from providing the new road link.1 The two\nmajor  benefits  defined  were  the  net  value  of  increased  agricultural  production  and\ntransport user cost savings. The transport cost savings, including passenger time, were\nbased  on  the  differences  between  road  transport  costs  and  the  cost  of  freight  being\ncarried by porters or of passengers\u2019 time costs on trails.\n\nThe  project  roads  were  evaluated  up  to  and  including  2025,  providing  benefit\n3.\nperiods  of  19.5  to  20.5  years  depending  on  the  timing  of  the  implementation  of  each\nroad. A residual value is applied in 2025, except for the overlay works on the east-west\nhighway  (EWH).  For  upgrading  works  and  new  construction,  a  residual  value  of  50\npercent  of  the  construction  cost  has  been  applied  because  of  the  extensive  earth  and\nother works involved that will have a substantial economic value beyond the end of the\nevaluation period.\n\nB.\n\nTraffic Growth Forecasts and Traffic Volumes\n\n4.\nCurrent traffic volumes on the project roads were determined from traffic counts\ncarried out in 1999 and 2001, which were normalized through the application of factors\nto convert specific counts to represent annual average daily traffic.2 For freight traffic, the\nforecast is based on an analysis of gross domestic product and the income elasticity of\ntransport  demand.  Passenger  growth  rates  are  based  on  population  growth  rate,  per\ncapita income growth, and the income elasticity of transport demand. Table A16.1 shows\nthe  traffic  projections  and  Table  A16.2  presents  the  traffic  growth  rates  including  the\nfactors  forming  those  rates.    For  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  section,  a  constant  traffic\ngrowth rate of 4 percent per annum was used.\n\nTable A16.1: Traffic Growth (1999-2023)\n\nRoad Link\n\nEast-West Highway\nDolalghat-Chautara\nBiratnagar-Bardanga\nUrlabari-Bardanga\nDamak-Gauriganj\nPouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim\nHile-Basantpur\na Traffic counts carried out in March 2001.\n\n1999\n\n1,170\n70\n155\n137\n156\n59a\n98a\n\n2003\n\n1,542\n92\n269\n180\n205\n68\n112\n\n2008\n\n2,430\n150\n420\n280\n320\n207\n156\n\n2023\n\n5,560\n330\n970\n650\n740\n502\n365\n\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, consultant, and staff estimates.\n\n                  \n\n1 Department  for  International  Development.  2001.

In the case of the\nEWH,  the  reductions  will  not  be  significant  enough  to  cause  any  generation  of  traffic.\nHowever  in  the  case  of  unpaved  roads  where  both  travel  times  and  costs  will  be\nreduced, additional generated passenger traffic is expected, no significant generation of\nfreight traffic is anticipated. The latter is due to the generally small additional savings to\nthe consumer caused by the savings in vehicle operating costs.\n\nIn  the  feasibility  study  a  standard  increase  in  traffic  of  30  percent  was  used  for\n6.\ncars and utilities, and 15 percent in the case of buses. These rates are based on studies\nof  generated  traffic  then  available  for  similar  roads  in  Nepal.  New  evidence  of  much\nhigher levels of traffic generation in the hill areas of the Eastern Region is now available.\nIn  the  study  carried  out  for  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  2000,  referred  to  above,  very  high  rates  of  traffic\ngeneration,  especially  of  light  vehicles  carrying  passengers,  have  followed  the\nprogressive completion of the road from the EWH to Ilam. This pattern was confirmed by\ntraffic  counts  on  the  improved  section  of  Ilam-Phidim  road  in  March  2001.  The  current\ntraffic  level  on  the  section  recently  completed  under  Third  Road  Improvement  Project\n(TRIP)  was  found  to  be  approximately  three  times  the  level  forecast.  Accordingly  the\nPouwa  Bhanjyang-Phidim  road3  was  reevaluated  with  a  generated  traffic  level  of  125\npercent,  similar  to  that  on  south  of  Ilam  but  less  than  that  on  the  TRIP  completed\nsection.\n\n7.\nNone  of  the  roads  included  in  the  Project  would  offer  a  better  alternative  route\nafter implementation than existing roads and no benefits to diverted traffic are included\nin the analysis.\n\nC.\n\nConstruction Standards and Project Costs\n\n8.\nFor the EWH, the only work recommended is a structural (strengthening) overlay\non  the  existing  road.  The  thickness  of  the  overlay  varies  based  on  the  remaining\nstrength of the existing pavement and the expected equivalent standard axles expected\nto traverse the road over the next 20 years. Different  design  standards  have  been  used\nfor the hill roads and the roads in the terai, as shown in Table A16.3. This is due mainly\nto terrain constraints in the hilly areas and the generally higher traffic on the terai roads.\n\n                  \n\n3 \n\nThis  road  is  the  last  section  of  Ilam-Phidim  road,  canceled  from  the  previous  ADB-TRIP  owing  to\nshortage of funds.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\nTable A16.3: Indicative Cross Section and Pavement Structure\n\nCarriage Way\n\nShoulder\n\nRoad Section\n\nBelbari - Chuharwa (140 km)\n\nWidth (m)\n\n7.0\n\nType\n\nAC\n\nWidth (m)\n\n2 x 1.75\n\nType\n\nDBST\n\n3.5\n\nBiratnagar - Bardanga (39 km)\nUrlabari - Bardanga (28 km)\nDamak - Gauriganj (22 km)\nDolalghat - Chautara (25 km)\nPouwa Bhanjyang - Phidim (24 km)\nHile - Basantpur (26 km)\nBasantpur - Khandbari (96 km)\nAC  =  asphalt  concrete;  DBST  =  double  bituminous  surface  treatment;  SBST  =  single  bituminous  surface\ntreatment; N/A = not applicable\n\n2 x 0.5\n\n2 x 2.0\n\nGravel\n\nDBST\n\nDBST\n\nSBST\n\nSBST\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n3.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.\nThe quantities are based on preliminary engineering, while the financial costs are\nbased  on  a  model  widely  used  in  Nepal  and  verified  by  comparison  with  recently\nawarded and ongoing contracts. Costs include acquired land, construction, supervision,\nand  project  management-related  costs.  Financial  costs  have  been  converted  to\neconomic costs following ADB guidelines with a standard conversion factor of 0.88.\n\n10.\nIn the case of the upgrading of hill roads where economic internal rates of return\n(EIRRs)  were  found  to  be  low,  a  lower  cost  gravel  standard  was  considered.  Because\nthe  terrain  and  climate  conditions  of  the  hill  areas  make  maintenance  gravel  roads\ndifficult,  the  alternative  option  tested  was  a  gravel  road  with  sealing  on  steep  grade\nsections. These produced lower EIRRs than the all-sealed standard because the lower\nroad  user  savings  and  higher  maintenance  costs  reduced  benefits  more  than  the  cost\nsavings.\n\nD.\n\nMaintenance\n\n11.\nA  set  of  six  maintenance  scenarios  was  set  up  using  the  HDM  manager\nmaintenance  policy  format.  Inputs  to  the  model  were  derived  from  the  condition  of  the\nexisting roads and DOR\u2019s maintenance practices. In essence this analysis showed that\nsealed roads were clearly superior to the earth or gravel option for the feeder roads and\nthat the 10-year asphalt concrete overlay for the EWH is superior to providing an asphalt\nconcrete  pavement  with  a  full  20-year  life.  Costs  were  based  on  existing  unit  rates  for\nthe  various  maintenance  components.  For  Basantpur-Khandbari,  1.2  percent  of\nconstruction  cost  was  considered  to  be  the  annual  maintenance  cost  based  on\nexperience with roads of similar standard and quality.\n\nE.\n\nBenefits\n\n12.\nThe  major  benefits  consist  of  savings  to  users  of  the  road  and  cover  vehicle\noperating  cost  savings  resulting  from  improved  surface  condition  and  passenger  time\nsavings for those for whom time lost has an economic or social value. Typical road user\nsavings, based on opening year surface roughness levels, are shown in Table A16.4. In\nboth  the  with  and  without  project  cases  roughness  levels  vary  from  year  to  year,\naccording  to  traffic  movements  and  maintenance  applied.  The  roughness  levels,\nexpressed in terms of the international roughness index, have a direct impact on vehicle\noperating cost level and hence on benefits. Existing unsealed road surfaces conditions\nresult in generally high roughness levels for the without project case.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nTable A16.4: Vehicle Operating Costs With and Without Improvement (NRs/km)\n\nPouwa Bhanjyang \u2013 Phidim 11.5\n\n20.6\n\n11.7\n\n37.3\n\n24.8\n\nRoad\n\nSection\n\nDolalghat \u2013Chautara\n      Section 1 (9 km)\n      Section 2 (16 km)\n\nBiratnagar \u2013 Bardanga\n      Section 1 (29 km)\n      Section 2 (10 km)\n\nUrlabari \u2013 Bardanga\n\nDamak \u2013 Gauriganj\n     Section 1 (5.9 km)\n     Section 2  (16.2 km)\n\nCar\n\nUtility / Jeep\n\nBus\n\nMini-truck\n\nTruck\n\nWithout With Without With Without With Without With Without With\n\n9.1\n13.8\n\n9.7\n16.2\n\n14.6\n\n8.0\n14.8\n\n13.8\n\n7.4\n7.4\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n6.7\n\n6.7\n\n6.7\n6.7\n\n7.4\n\n15.5\n24.9\n\n11.8\n11.8\n\n29.1\n41.7\n\n24.2\n24.2\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n\n15.6\n29.1\n\n25.8\n\n12.2\n26.2\n\n9.3\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\n9.4\n9.4\n\n23.0\n41.5\n\n14.8\n14.8\n\n10.7\n18.0\n\n36.8\n\n14.8\n\n16.1\n\n18.8\n37.4\n\n14.8\n14.8\n\n8.9\n16.3\n\n22.5\n29.2\n\n19.2\n19.2\n\n25.9\n\n19.0\n\n13.2\n22.3\n\n19.9\n\n11.1\n20.2\n\n8.8\n8.8\n\n8.8\n\n8.8\n8.8\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n\n7.0\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n7.0\n\n-\n\nHile \u2013 Basantpur\n\n24.9\n\n11.8\n\n41.7\n\n24.2\n\n-\n\n29.2\n\n19.2\n\n- =   not applicable.\nNote: Costs include passenger time savings.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, consultant, and staff estimates.\n\nBenefits also accrue to generated traffic that is at present deterred from using the\n13.\nroad  due  poor  conditions  and  seasonal  access.  The  benefits  to  generated  traffic  are\ncalculated by assuming the demand curve is linear with respect to cost, and the benefit\nper  unit  of  traffic  is  half  that  of  existing  or  normal  traffic.  In  addition  maintenance  cost\nsavings for those roads to be upgraded to sealed standard is small. This is usually about\n2-3  percent  of  total  benefits,  but  is  about  5  percent  in  the  case  of  the  roads  with  the\nlowest traffic levels.\n\nFor Basantpur-Khandbari, two sources of benefits were evaluated and included:\n14.\n(i) incremental benefits resulting from increased agriculture production, and (ii) transport\nuser  savings  including  passenger  time  savings.  Most  of  the  usable  land  in  the  zone  of\ninfluence  is  used  but  with  good  road  access  a  modest  switch  to  higher  value  crops  is\nassumed,  with  4  percent  converting  to  the  growing  of  fruit,  vegetables,  and  pulses,\nproducing  an  annual  producer  surplus  benefits  of  about  NRs90  million.  Transport  of\ngoods  in  the  road\u2019s  zone  of  influence  is  currently  carried  out  by  porters  at  a  high  cost\nand by foot for passengers at a high time cost. With the new road, freight will transfer to\ntrucks  at  a  considerably  lower  cost,  while  pedestrians  will  transfer  to  buses,  about\nNRs250  per  ton  kilometer  using  porters  compared  with  about  NRs5.0  by  trucks.  In\nmountainous areas, people generally walk at a rate of about 4 kilometer (km) per hour\nwhile a bus can travel at 7 to 10 or more times that speed thus saving considerable time\nthat  can  be  used  for  economic  purposes.  The  value  of  time  saved  is  based  on  daily\nwages of about NRs90 and is estimated at NRs2.05 per hour. The annual cost savings\nare estimated at NRs9,448 per km.\n\nF.\n\nEconomic analysis\n\n15.\nThe economic evaluation discounts the stream of benefits and costs over a 25-\nyear evaluation period from the present. The EIRRs range between 12.1 to 33.0 percent.\nTable  A16.5  provides  the  summary  net  benefit  table  for  each  subproject,  using  a\ndiscount rate of 12 percent.\n\n\fTable A16.5: Summary of Net Benefits (in NRs million) and EIRR\n\nBelbari-\nChuharwa\n\nBiratnagar-\nBardanga\n\nUrlabari-\nBardanga\n\nDamak- P.

The  tests  applied  for  road\nimprovement component are (i) delayed completion by 1 year, (ii) increase construction\ncosts  by  20  percent,  (iii)  reduce  normal  and  generated  traffic  vehicle  operating  cost\nbenefits  by  20  percent,  (iv)  reduce  traffic  growth  rates  by  50  percent,  and  (v)  exclude\nvalue of time benefits.\n\n17.\nA one-year delay in obtaining benefits as a result of delayed completion reduces\nthe viability of the roads. A slightly larger impact occurs with either a 20 percent increase\nin  construction  costs  or  a  20  percent  reduction  in  benefits.  Excluding  passenger  time\nsavings has a higher negative impact on viability, except in the case of the Basantpur-\nKhandbari Road, where passenger time savings are a very small component of benefits.\nThe  EIRRs  for  all  the  other  hill  road  projects  fall  to  close  to  12  percent  or  below.\nReducing  traffic  growth  by  50  percent  causes  major  reductions  in  benefit  levels  in  the\nlater  years  of  the  evaluation  period,  but  the  impact  on  EIRRs  is  generally  only  a  little\nlarger  than  that  of  the  other  tests.    However  in  the  case  of  the  roads  with  the  lowest\nrates of return this impact is very significant. The switching values for the overall project\nare 165 percent higher for costs and 86 percent lower for benefits.\n\nTable A16.6: Sensitivity Tests of Road Improvement Components (EIRR - %)\n\nBase\nCase\n\n1 Year\nDelay\n\nConst.\nCosts\n+20%\n\nVOC\nSavings\n-20%\n\nExclude\nPass.\nTime\n\nTraffic\nGrowth\n-50%\n\nRoad\n\nBelbari-Chuharwa (EWH)\n\nBiratnagar - Bardanga\n\nUrlabari \u2013 Bardanga\n\nDamak-Gauriganj\n\nDolalghat \u2013 Chautara\n\nHile-Basantpur\n\n33.0\n\n19.2\n\n25.1\n\n27.2\n\n13.1\n\n16.3\n\n29.7\n\n17.2\n\n23.4\n\n25.3\n\n12.0\n\n15.0\n\n29.3\n\n16.6\n\n22.1\n\n24.0\n\n11.1\n\n14.0\n\n29.9\n\n16.7\n\n22.2\n\n24.2\n\n11.2\n\n14.1\n\n25.2\n\n14.9\n\n20.5\n\n22.6\n\n9.2\n\n12.2\n\n10.0\n\n23.9\n\n13.7\n\n19.0\n\n21.2\n\n8.9\n\n12.1\n\n7.8\n\nPouwa Bhanjyang\u2013Phidim\n EIRR = economic internal rate of return; VOC= vehicle operating cost.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project, consultant, and staff estimates.\n\n11.1\n\n12.1\n\n10.0\n\n10.1\n\n18.\nFor  the  Basantpur-Khandbari  section,  increasing  costs,  reducing  producer\nsurplus,  and  decreasing  benefits  by  20  percent  each  cause  the  EIRR  to  decrease  to\nclose  to  12  percent.

The  population  data  for  the\nproject  roads  are  shown  in  Table  A17.1,  which  shows  variations  in  population  growth\nrates in each of the road areas; this reflects the effects of seasonal and long-term, out-\nmigration from the hills to the terai.\n\nTable A17.1: Poverty Incidence in the Project Area (1999)\n\nRoad\n\nDistrict\n\nTotal\nPopulation\n\nNLSS%\nBPL\n\nPRA%\nBPL\n\nLandless\nHouseholds\n%\n\nP.Bhanjyang-Phidim\n\nPancthar\n\nBiratnagar -Bardanga\n\nUlarbari - Bardanga\n\nDamak -Gauriganj\n\nMorang\n\nMorang\n\nJhapa\n\nDolalghat - Chautara\n\nSindupalchok\n\nBelbari-Chuharwa\n\nBasantpur-Khandbari\n\nSankhuwasabha\n\nHile-Basantpur\n\nMorang, Sunsari\nSaptari, Siraha\n\nSankhuwasabha;\nDhankuta\n\n17,324\n\n72,151\n\n107,302\n\n53,758\n\n32,698\n\n452,867\n\n151,342\n\n178,175\n\nBPL =  below poverty line, NLSS = national living standard survey.\nSource: TA 2969-NEP: Fourth Road Improvement Project.\n\n68\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n31\n\n27\n\n73\n\n68\n\n45\n\n40\n\n55\n\n50\n\n80\n\n27\n\n73\n\n68\n\n29\n\n21\n\n21\n\n23\n\n52\n\n10\n\n52\n\n48\n\n2.\nMost  landholdings  in  the  project  area  are  between  1  to  2  hectares  (ha).\nLandholdings are fragmented as a result of the rapid growth of the population and a lack\nof agricultural land available for expansion. This is a particular problem in the hill areas\nwhere suitable land is restricted by slope and soil type.\n\n3.\nRural  households  rely  on  agriculture  for  the  main  source  of  income.  The\ngenerally  small  land  plots  do  not  allow  sufficient  production  to  feed  families.  Poor\nhouseholds can produce about three months supply of food for their families and have to\nsupplement this production with food bought from wages paid for daily labor. However,\nincome from wage labor is low. Deficits in income are frequently covered by borrowing\ncash or food at high rates of interest from wealthy landowners. Seasonal migration to the\nterai from the hill areas produces an important source of income.\n\n4.\nThe 1999 National Living Standards Surveys (NLSS) figures for poverty in Nepal\ngive  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  Nrs7,075  as  the  poverty  level  in  the  hill  and\nNrs5,633  for  the  terai  areas.  The  national  average  income  per  capita  approximates\nNrs9,700. Data for the incidence of poverty in the project road areas is shown in Table\nA17.1. The highest level of poverty recorded in the NLSS was in the Pouwa Bhanjyang-\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\nPhidim road with 68 percent of the household were below the poverty line (between 45\nto 50 percent of the households in the PRA). Very high levels of poverty were also found\nalong  the  Dolalghat-Chautara  section,  85  percent  compared  with  the  NLSS  district\naverage of 31 percent.\n\n5.\nUsing  the  NLSS  figures  of  438,796  people  of  a  total  population  of  1,065,617\n(41.2  percent)  affected  by  the  project,  have  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.  The  PRA\nexercise  figures  yielded  slightly  higher  overall  estimates  of  poverty  at  502,622  persons\nliving below the poverty line, representing about 47.2 percent of project beneficiaries.\n\n6.\nAs  in  the  case  of  income  and  poverty,  large  disparities  are  seen  in  social\nindicators across regions and socioeconomic groups. People in rural areas are twice as\nlikely  to  be  literate  as  those  in  urban  areas.  Illiteracy  rates  are  the  highest  among\ndisadvantaged groups. The other social indicators such as access to health, education,\nand safe drinking water are lower in rural areas as compared with those in urban areas.\n\n7.\nThe PRA found that the Brahmin/Chhetri/Newar groups (BCNs) dominate on the\nterai  roads  with  considerable  populations  of  occupational  castes  and  some  migrant  hill\ntribes.  The  hill  tribes  along  with  some  BCNs  dominate  the  hill  areas  in  the  east.  The\nBCNs  dominate  on  the  Dolalghat-Chautara  road  with  significant  occupational  caste\ngroups.\n\n2.\n\nCommunity Perceptions\n\n8.\nThe  PRA  exercise  addressed  how  people  in  the  different  income  groups  in  the\nproject area would benefit from the project and also if these benefits were meaningful to\nthem. The PRA also asked about people\u2019s perceptions of opportunities that the project\nwould  bring,  which  were  determined  as  (i)  improved  transport  and  lower  costs,  (ii)\nincreased  mobility  and  access  to  school  and  health  facilities,  (iii)  new  employment\nopportunities, and (iv) employment on the construction of the Project.\n\n9.\nBusiness and trading households expected lower transport costs and increased\nbusiness  levels.  Wage  labor  expected  increased  opportunity  for  paid  employment.\nWomen  focused  on  increased  mobility  and  access  to  health  and  educational  facilities\nwhile  men  emphasized  the  economic  benefits  of  access  to  markets  and  employment\nopportunities.  Hill  communities  emphasized  improved  access  to  markets  while  terai\ncommunities  emphasized  improved  mobility,  and  access  to  schools,  and  reduced\ntransportation fares and charges as the main benefit from the project.\n\n3.\n\nRepresentative Roads of the Project Areas\n\n10.\n\nThe Project roads consist of\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEast-West Highway (EWH): Belbari-Chuharwa;\nCentral Region: Dolalghat-Chaurawa;\nTerai  roads:  Biratnagar-Bardanga,  Urlabari-Bardanga,  and  Damak-\nGauriganj;\nEast  hill  roads:  Hile-Basantpur,  Basantpur-Khandbari,  and  Pouwa\nBhanjyang-Phidim.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\n11.\nFor the purpose of analysis of benefits distribution and poverty impact ratio, four\nroads  were  selected  as  representative  roads  as  follows:  Belbari-Chuharwa,  Dolalghat-\nChautara, Biratnagar-Bardanga, and Pouwa Bhanjyang-Phidim.\n\n4.\n\nPoverty Impact Analysis\n\n12.\nEconomic Development Impact. The project roads would have a positive effect\non  agriculture,  increase  business  activities,  generate  more  employment,  as  well  as\nimprove  access  to  health  and  education  facilities.  The  reduction  in  vehicle  operating\ncosts (VOCs) may lead to a reduction in the cost of goods and services in the area. If\ncompetition  increases  between  freight  companies  for  the  transport  of  agricultural\nproduce  then  this  may  eventually  be  passed  on  to  local  farmers  by  way  of  reduced\nfreight rates. The increase in the demand for agricultural products and the expansion of\nthe  service  sector  to  satisfy  this  demand  will  create  employment  within  the  transport\nsector for the rural poor. More opportunities will be available for work for drivers of both\nmotorized and nonmotorized transport, and more labor will be required for loading and\nunloading  vehicles.  This  will  necessitate  an  increase  in  businesses  that  service  and\nrepair transport vehicles, which will also provide more employment opportunities.\n\nPoverty Reduction through Employment. The Project will need approximately\n13.\n1,000  jobs  for  unskilled  labor.  Each  construction  project  takes  on  average  2.5  years,\nimplying  approximately  912,500  person-days.  At  the  existing  approximate  daily  wage\nrate  for  unskilled  labor  of  Nrs80,  this  approximates  a  total  income  to  unskilled  labor  of\nNrs73.0  million  (about  $1.0  million).  Although  the  employment  created  through  road\nconstruction  activities  is  short  term  during  the  construction  process,  unskilled  labor\nwould be able to be trained to follow on the project construction phase with the proper\nmaintenance  techniques.  Application  of  the  \u201clength  worker\u201d1  concept  will  assist  in  the\nmaintenance  of  these  roads.  This  ensures  that  those  living  directly  alongside  the  road\ntake up employment opportunities arising from maintenance requirements. The effect of\nusing labor from the project road areas to assist in maintenance would sustain income\nfor the poor people of the area on a long-term basis.\n\n14.\nThe  improvement  in  the  roads  will  encourage  increase  of  agricultural  products\ndue to a more efficient and faster way to surrounding market areas. At the present time\nfew storage facilities are available for agricultural produce and perishable crops; this has\nresulted in crops being produced on a small scale for local consumption. The increase in\nagricultural activity is likely to lead to an increase in nonmotorized transport employment\nopportunities. Improved access will allow greater mobility and enable people to travel to\nwork and to health, education, and other services. The road projects will facilitate labor\nmobility to other areas in search of work.\n\n15.\nImpact  on  Human  Poverty.  The  improvement  of  the  project  roads  will  enable\nthe  poor  in  the  influence  area  of  the  roads  greater  accessibility  to  other  services,\nschools, and hospitals, which at the present time are limited and involve long trip times\nto  qualified  facilities.  Travel  time  will  be  decreased  and  facilities  can  be  reached\nefficiently. The rate of attendance in school will increase, directly leading to a reduction\nin the rate of illiteracy.\n\n                                                          \n1  Each  length  worker  is  assigned  to  a  specific  section  of  road,  responsible  for  regular  and  routine\n\nmaintenance of the road.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 17, page 4\n\n16.\nReduced Vehicle Operating Cost Impacts. The main economic benefit is in the\nform of reduced VOC to both passenger and freight transport, accruing to the operator of\nthe  vehicle  including  bus  company,  freight  company,  car  driver,  etc.  VOC  savings  in  a\ncompetitive market are also passed on to the individual user of the transport service, in\nthe form of lower bus fares or a fall in the freight rate. Traffic on all representative roads\nconsists of mainly buses and trucks. A saving to the vehicle operator of the bus or freight\ncompanies through the reduction in VOC may be passed on to the individual in the form\nof lower fares or freight rates.\n\nImpact on Women. Some of the unskilled labor positions could be allocated to\n17.\nwomen. Women could also be involved in road activities by selling food and water to the\nroad  crews.  Those  living  directly  alongside  the  road  take  up  employment  opportunities\narising  from  maintenance  requirements.  In  particular  this  would  benefit  those  women\nwhose mobility is generally restricted by culture and domestic responsibilities.\n\nB. \n\nMethodology\n\n18.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  consist  of  road  user  benefits,  i.e.,  VOC,\ntime  savings,  and  savings  in  maintenance  costs  of  the  project  roads.  The  distribution\nsubdivides  these  economic  benefits  to  both  passenger  and  freight  vehicles,  between\nowners/operators  and  passengers  of  vehicles,  and  also  the  Government.  The  benefits\nare then divided into those that would reach the poor and the nonpoor.\n\nD.\n\nDistribution Analysis\n\n19.\nBased  on  surveys  undertaken  in  each  of  the  representative  project  roads  area\nthe  following  assumptions  have  been  made  in  terms  of  what  will  be  passed  on  to  the\nuser of the services:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nbus  operators  will  pass  on  to  the  user  20  percent  of  the  savings  they\nreceive in the form of reduced fares;\nfreight operator will pass 50 percent of the savings on to the user;\nof  the  benefits  that  are  distributed  to  cars  and  pickup  vehicles,  the\ngovernment is allocated a share of 13 percent; and\nof the benefits distributed to trucks, the government is allocated a share\nof 7 percent of the total benefits attributable to trucks.\n\n20.\nThe  estimated  direct  benefits  of  the  representative  roads  to  the  economy  in\npresent value terms are presented in Table A17.2, using a discount rate of 12 percent.\nThese simply represent the sum of the present value of benefits to passengers, freight\nusers, vehicle owners, and the Government.\n\nTable A17.2.

If  unskilled  labor  for  project  is  used  for  roads  improvement  activities,  this\napproximates a total income to unskilled labor of Nrs73.0 million ($1.0 million) for the 2.5\nyear  implementation  period,  distributed  on  equal  yearly  basis.  The  EWH  is  unlikely  to\nneed unskilled labor, and income to the poor over construction period in each of other 3\nrepresentative  roads  was  estimated  as  Nrs8.76  million.  The  shadow  wage  rate  factor\napplying  to  unskilled  labor  in  Nepal  is  approximately  0.75,  to  be  used  to  convert  the\nfinancial  costs  into  economic  values.    The  assumptions  used  for  allocating  road  user\nbenefits to the poor are shown in Table A17.3.\n\nItem\nProportion of savings passed on by operator\nProportion of these savings going to the poor\n\nTable A17.3: Road User Benefits Allocation\nFreight\n50%\n20%\n\n20%\n80%\n\nBus\n\nGovernment\n\nNet Benefit\n15%\n\n23.\nA  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  examine  the  effect  of  changing\nsome of the key assumptions in the analysis and calculation of the poverty impact ratio.\nThe  poverty  impact  ratio  increases  with  increases  in  competition.  This  illustrates  the\nimportance  of  enhancing  competition  in  the  transport  market  to  help  reduce  poverty.\nWhen  time  benefits  are  reduced,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  cannot  be  calculated  for  the\nDolalghat-Chautara  and  Pouwa  Bhanjyang-Phidim  roads  as  net  present  values  fall\nbelow  zero.  The  total  of  the  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  for  the  representative  roads,\nthe poverty impact ratio, and the result of sensitivity analysis on the poverty impact ratio\nare presented in Table A17.4. The high poverty impact ratios, particularly for the Pouwa\nBhanjyang-Phidim road, imply a large net cost to the Government and the economy.\n\nTable A17.4: Net Benefits for the Poor, Poverty Impact Ratio, and Sensitivity Test\n\nItem\n\nBelbari-\nChuharwa\n\nDolalghat-\nChautara\n\nBiratnagar\n-Bardanga\n\nP.Bhanjyang-\nPhidim\n\nBenefits for the poor (NRs million)\nBase poverty impact ratio (PIR)\n50% reduction in competition (PIR)\n50% increase in competition (PIR)\n50% reduction in time benefits (PIR)\n\u2013 =  not applicable, PIR = poverty impact ratio.\nSource: Distribution Analysis, consultant report.\n\n728.54\n0.33\n0.30\n0.35\n0.22\n\n11.33\n1.53\n1.09\n1.97\n\u2013\n\n63.09\n0.55\n0.47\n0.64\n0.42\n\n9.87\n7.77\n5.70\n9.84\n\u2013\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 October 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nNRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Nepalese Rupee/s (NRe/NRs)\n$0.0131\nNRs76.30\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  Nepalese  rupee  is  pegged  to  the  Indian  rupee  (Re)  at  NRs1.60  to  Re1.00,  and  is\nfully convertible on all current account transactions.\nFor calculations in this report, the exchange rate of $1.00 = NRs75.0 is used, which was\nthe rate prevailing during appraisal.\n", "ADB\nARMP\nCSP\nDFID\nDOR\nDOTM\nEIA\nEIRR\nEWH\nGDP\nGTZ\nMPPW\nNGO\nPBM\nRMDP\nROW\nRP\nSDC\nSRN\nTA\nTESU\nTRIP\nvpd\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nannual road maintenance program\ncountry strategy and program\nDepartment for International Development (United Kingdom)\nDepartment of Roads\nDepartment of Traffic Management\nenvironmental impact assessment\neconomic internal rate of return\nEast-West Highway\ngross domestic product\nGerman Technical Cooperation\nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works\nnongovernment organization\nperformance-based maintenance\nRoad Maintenance and Development Project\nright-of-way\nresettlement plan\nSwiss Development Corporation\nStrategic Road Network\ntechnical assistance\nTraffic Engineering and Safety Unit\nThird Road Improvement Project\nvehicles per day\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  15  July.
