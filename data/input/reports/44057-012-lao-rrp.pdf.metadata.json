These  les\nincorporated in the design of PSME2.12 \n  \nh,  designed  to \n10. \nThe  proposed  PSME2  is  based  on  a  program  cluster  approac\nchronologically sequence packaging of high-impact policy reforms, which allow\ns for reforms to \nbe phased in over an adequate period of time in a coherent yet flexible framewo\nrk. The program \ncluster will comprise two subprograms enveloped by a medium-term results fra\nmework. Given \nthe resource boom and its effect on the non-resource sector, it is critical to pro\nmote reforms to \nraise productivity in this sector, which is dominated by SMEs; hence, a program\n that focuses on \nthe promotion and development of the private  sector and SMEs. Based on nu\nmerous surveys \nand reports produced in the first PSME program, PSME2 has identified three \nareas critical for \nsustainable  development  of  SMEs  which  build  on  the  gains  and  continu\nes  the  reforms \nundertaken  by  the  government  in  the  first  PSME  program:  (i)  SME  polic\ny  development, \ncoordination,  and  access  to  services;  (ii)  regulatory  efficiency;  and  (iii)  trade\n  policy  for  SME \ndevelopment. The design of the cluster supports both the supply and demand\n sides of private \nsector development and SME growth. On the supply side, the program is addr\nessing inefficient \nregulations  that  hinder  SME  growth  and  competitiveness.  On  the  demand  sid\ne,  it  focuses  on \nimproving  SME  access  to  services,  including  finance,  and  promoting  trade  po\nlicies  to  benefit \nSMEs in line with ADB\u2019s engagement in Aid for Trade. The d\nesign of subprogram 1 will focus on \nbroad-based reforms to imp\nrove the business environment for the private sector and SMEs to \noperate effectively and effic\niently, while reforms in subprogram 2 will focus on how SMEs can \nmaximize benefit in sectors with the highest potential for SME development. T\nhe entire cluster \nwill  be  in  line  with  the  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  202013  on  gender  empowerm\nent  and  gender \nmainstreaming  guidelines.  The  program  cluster  will  be  classified  as  e\nffective  gender \nmainstreaming by including gender responsive measures and activities in the policy matrix and\n \nutilizing gender-related indicators in the design and monitoring framework. \n \nB. \n \nSME sector.

For the national rollout,\nwith ADB support through technical assistance has upgraded both hardware a\nhas  carried  out  training  on  implementing  registration  procedures.  The  nati\nsubstantially improved SME access to registration. By May 2011, almost 70,000\nregistered  compared  to  about  35,000  in  late  2008.  This  registration  system  h\npositive  impact  on  women  entrepreneurs,  as  the  gender  bias  in  a  high-cost  s\nreduced  through  the  simplification  of \ncompliance  costs.  Of  newly  registered  enterprises  in  2010,  54.8%  are  owned\nfrom  43.9%  of  newly  registered  enterprises  in  2009.  The  government  also\ntransparency of the system by publishing its first book on enterprise registration\ndisaggregated data by gender, region, and size.   \n   \nSMEs\u2019 access to \n17. \nOne of the constraints identified in the SME national strategy has been \nfinance.  The  GTZ  Enterprise  Survey  of  200917  found  that  only  32%  of  ente\nrprises  surveyed \nreported  had  borrowed  from  a  financial  institution  in  2009.  SMEs  face  leg\nal  and  capacity \nconstraints  in  accessing  credit.  Banks  primarily  rely  on  the  use  of  fixed  asset\ns  as collateral  to \nsecure  loans.  Another  critical  constraint  is  limited  credit  information  on  custo\nmers  that  allow \nbanks to assess credit risk. Two reforms under subprogram 1 were undertaken \nto address these \nconstraints. First, the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) of The Bank of the Lao \nPDR completed \nthe development of its new web-based credit information system, which was of\nficially launched \nin December 2010. Credit information is uploaded into the CIB database and m\nade available to \ncommercial banks. With creditors\u2019 information more readily available, banks wil\nl be more willing \nto  provide  financing  to  SMEs.  The  second  reform  relates  to  the  government\u2019s\n  approval  of  the \nImplementing Decree on the  Secured  Transactions  Law.  The  decree  will  prov\nide  the  basis  for \nestablishing the secured transaction registry, which will allow SMEs to obtain fin\nancing by using \nmovable  assets  such  as  vehicles  as  collateral.  The  government  is  also  conc\nerned  about  the \nlimited  access  of  SMEs  to  business  development  services  (BDSs).  Accord\ning  to  the  GTZ \nenterprise survey, only 5% of BDS providers used by enterprises were comme\nrcial BDSs, 12% \nwere  publicly  provided  BDSs,  and  the  remaining  80%  plus  were  informal  s\nervice  providers \n(spouse,  f\nriend).  The  government  recognizes  that  measures  are  necessary  to  develop  the \nprivate  sector  BDS  market.  It  took  concrete  steps  to  facilitate  SMEs\u2019  access  to  services  and \ndevelop the private sector market for BDSs by making preparations to pilot test the network of \nSME  service  providers.  Steps  taken  include  establishing  the  Small  and  Me\ndium  Enterprise \nPromotion and Develop\nment Office (SMEPDO) BDSs unit and assigning staff to the unit. In the \ninitial  stage,  the  network,  which  consists  of  members  from  the  private  sector,  will  focus  on \nhelping and training SMEs on loan applications; their role will expand in the future. This marks a \nshift from the conventional view in the Lao PDR where the government provides BDSs to SMEs. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n17 Lao-German  Programme  on  Human  Resources  Development  for  a  Market  Economy.  2010.

First,  the  RIA  interagency  task\nforce  headed  by \nthe  vice  minister  of  industry  and  commerce  that  was  established  by  the  gove\nrnment  in  2009, \ndeveloped  a  draft  action  plan  to  implement  RIA  in  selected  line  ministries. \nThe  action  plan \nincluded  advocacy  and  communication  activities  and  capacity  development  ac\ntivities.  Second, \nthe government established a RIA unit at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce\n (MOIC), within \nthe  legal  division  under  the  Permanent  Secretary  Office.  The  unit  produce\nd  a  set  of  RIA \nguidelines  and  the  MOIC  RIA  work  plan  of  proposed  legislation  that  will  go \nthrough  the  RIA \nprocess in the next 12 months, which have been endorsed by the vice ministe\nr of Industry and \nCommerce  and  the  deputy  permanent  secretary.  The  government  also  app\nroved  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Decree  on  Implementing  the  Investment  Promotion  Law  in  201\n1.  This  decree \nharmonized the enterprise registration system at ERO with the Investment Pro\nmotion Law, 2009 \nw  on  special  economic  zones,  so  an  investment  license  is  no  long\n  th\nand\ner  necessary  for \ne  la\ngeneral  b\nusinesses.  Enterpr\nises  can  begin  operating  as  soon  as  they  obtain  the  enterprise \nregistration  certificate  from  ERO.  This  reduced  red  tape  and  cut  the  number  of  days  taken  to \nstart a business. The decree also provides the basis for the establishment of a \none-stop service \ncenter that acts as the focal point for enterprises to obtain information and subm\nit applications. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Strengthening Trade Policies to Support Small and\nEnterprises\u2019 Growth \n\n Medium-Sized \n\n19\n\nSubprogram  1  of  PSME2  supports  the  government  in  strengthening \n\n \ntrade  policies  to \n20. \nsupport SME growth.

The\n  first  channel  is \nthrough higher, broad-based, and sustainable economic growth. Reducing busin\ness compliance \ncosts and lowering trade facilitation costs will increase the number of SMEs, th\nereby supporting \ninclusive  economic  growth.  Measures  to  increase  the  benefits  to  SMEs  fro\nm  greater  trade \nopenness will enhance the income of entrepreneurs and workers in these secto\nrs. The second \nchannel  is  through  the  labor  market,  with  increased  real  wage\ns  and  hiring  activity  from  higher \ninvestment  by  SMEs.  The  third  channel  is  through  lower  prices  of  goods  and  services.  By \nimproving transpar\nency in trade policy, supporting integration within the region and the rest of \nthe world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, domestic prices will fal\nl through greater \neconomic efficiency.
