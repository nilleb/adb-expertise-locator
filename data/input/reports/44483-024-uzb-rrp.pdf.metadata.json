Transport  is  crucial  in  promoting regional  and  domestic \ntrade. 2  The  second  investment  program 3  will  finance  the  reconstruction  of  the  Uzbekistan \nsection  of  CAREC  Corridor  2,  which  connects  Uzbekistan  to  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the \nKyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. This reconstruction will improve connectivity and \nroad  safety,  and  boost  domestic  and  international  trade.  The  second  investment  program  fits \nwith Strategy 20204 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan (2011\u20132013), and is aligned with the United Nations Decade of Action for Road \nSafety  2011\u20132020.5 The  proposal  is  in  line  with  the  proposed  Uzbekistan  Transport  Sector \nStrategy  (2006\u20132020)6 and road map,  as  well  as  the  CAREC  Transport and Trade  Facilitation \nStrategy and Action Plan (footnote 2). \n\n3. \nRegional  context.  CAREC  Corridor  2  connects  the  Caucasus  and  Mediterranean  to \nEast  Asia.  The  route  covers  Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the People's Republic of China (PRC). With the rapid economic \nexpansion  of  the  PRC  to  the  east,  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan  to  the  north,  and \nAzerbaijan to the west, Uzbekistan has an unprecedented opportunity to emerge as a center for \ntrade and commerce and to achieve rapid economic growth. \n\n4. \nThe  Uzbekistan  sections  of  CAREC  Corridor  2  comprise  the  A373,  A373/4R112,  and \nA380 highways. The 404-kilometer (km) A373 from Tashkent to Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic is \nthe  only  link  between  Fergana  valley  and  the  rest  of  the  country,  and  is  an  important  road \ntransport link between the PRC and Central and West Asia. The A373/4R112 extends the A373 \nfrom  Kamchik  to  Namangan.  Fergana  valley,  with  a  third  of  the  country's  population,  exports \nfertilizer,  cotton  yarn  and  textile,  chemical  products,  fruits,  and  vegetables.  To  increase \ndomestic and international trade and accommodate heavy traffic, these highways will need to be \nreconstructed  and  expanded.  In  June  2010  the  government  passed  resolution  126 7  to \nreconstruct  the  \u0410373.  The  1,204  km  A380  primarily  carries  fuel,  agricultural  commodities,  and \nindustrial  consumer goods.  Another  ongoing  highway  investment  in Kazakhstan  (supported  by \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan. Manila. \n3  The  second  investment  program  is  an  extension  of  the  ongoing  investment  program  (ADB.  2010.

Resolution  No.  126  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  Additional  measure  to  ensure \n\nsustainable transport communication via mountain pass Kamchik. Tashkent (26 June). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nADB)8 will connect Beyneu (a town on Uzbekistan\u2019s border) with Uzbekistan\u2019s A380 and the port \nof Aktau on the Caspian Sea. All these highways, when completed, will provide Uzbekistan and \nother Central Asian countries with direct access to the Caspian Sea, South Asia, and the Black \nSea  (via  road  corridors  being  built  in  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia).  The  second \ninvestment  program  links  with  CAREC  Corridor  6,  which  reaches  the  ring  road  in  Afghanistan \nand Pakistan\u2019s main ports. \n\n5. \nOverview  of  roads.  The  country  has  more  than  183,000  km  of  roads;  42,530  km  of \nthese are highways. Roads are classified as international (3,626 km), regional (21,995 km), and \nnational  (16,909  km).  While  the  road  network  is  adequate,  providing  access  throughout  the \ncountry, it has a backlog of road rehabilitation work. The existing road map prioritizes the A380 \nand the A373. \n\n6. \nIn  2010,  roads  accounted  for  32%  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  freight  by  ton-km  and  88%  of  its \npassengers by passenger-km. More vehicles and private road-hauling companies, and shorter \ntransport hauls of manufactured goods have increased road freight. This market share growth is \nlikely  to  continue,  especially  for  general  cargo.  With  the  country\u2019s  high  rates  of  economic \ngrowth,  vehicle  fleets  are  projected  to  double  every  5  years.  This  growth  needs  to  be \nsustainable, effective, and cost-efficient, and requires improved road safety. \n\nRoad funding and sustainability. Uzbekistan spends 1% of its gross domestic product \n7. \non roads. While low by international standards, this has been gradually increasing.9 The goal is \nto  bring  funding  to  international  levels  or  higher.  The  Republican  Road  Fund  (RRF)  was \nestablished under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for this purpose, particularly to deal with capital \ninvestment in, and maintenance of, common-use roads.10 The fund is responsible for up to 25% \nof  all financing  of  all  networks.  Although  RRF  income  increased  by  about  23%  annually  in the \nlast  5  years,  investment  needs  are  higher.  Alternative  financing  sources  must  be  tapped,  and \npartnerships established with the private sector. Road-user charges must be introduced. \n\nThe  government  prepared  the  Accelerated  Development  Program  (2011\u20132015) 11  by \n8. \nupdating  the  National  Road  Development  Program  (2010\u20132014).  Investments  mainly  involve \nreconstruction  of  existing  networks,  although  some  greenfield  projects  are  envisaged.  Other \n\u2015softer\u2016  infrastructure  investments  are  part  of  the  plan,  including  improving  institutional \neffectiveness,  planning,  project  management,  and  road  safety.  Uzbekistan  has  a  policy \nframework  for  roads  that  supports  good  governance  and  accountability,  improved  road \nsustainability,  seamless  transport  logistics,  greater  private  sector  investment,  and  sound  road \nmaintenance.  Since  2003,  the  government  has  pursued  several  policy  and  sector  reforms, \nincluding (i) separating road transport operations from road construction, (ii) creating RRF as a \nquasi-independent body, (iii) promoting competitive bidding for all road construction works, and \n(iv)  establishing  an  external  quality  control mechanism. The government has  also restructured \nUzavtoyul  (the  sole nationwide  road agency),  converting  it  to a  state joint  stock  company  with \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 2 \n(Mangystau Oblast Sections) Investment Program. Manila. \n\n9  The  estimate  of  1%  is  based  on  the  average  expenditure  per  km  for  the  network  under  the  purview  of  the \nRepublican Road Fund. The corresponding  expenditures  are 2.5% in Viet Nam (2008); 2.3% in the  PRC (2006); \n1.8%  in Thailand (2006); and below 1.0%  in the Philippines (2008), lower than the share of Uzbekistan. \n\n10 RRF,  established  in  2003,  is  a  quasi-independent  agency  under  the  auspices  of  MOF  and  responsible  for \nprogramming, planning, and budgeting of common-use roads comprising international, national, and local roads. \n11 Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No 1446 on Accelerated Development of Infrastructure, \n\nand Construction in Transport and Communications (2011\u20132015). Tashkent (21 December 2010). \n\n\fclear  performance  and  accountability  targets.12 The government  is  now  considering  separating \nseveral  road  construction  companies  from  the  Uzavtoyul  structure  to  a  more  commercial \nownership  structure.  A  law  on  roads  for  vehicular  traffic  enacted  in  2007  allows  the  private \nsector  to  finance  highway  construction.  A  state-owned  road  equipment  pool  company  created \nunder  the  ADB  loan  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Project 13  services  all  contractors. \nThe  second  investment  program  will  contribute  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  Accelerated  Development \nProgram and policy framework for roads. \n\nFinancing  modality.  An  MFF  is  proposed  to  finance  the  second  investment  program. \n9. \nThis follows the recommendations from past operations to engage with the government over a \nlonger  time  horizon,  and  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a  partnership  with  the  government.14 All  the \nprerequisites for the use of an MFF are in place\u2014a coherent strategy and sector road map, a \npolicy  framework,  an  investment  plan,  and  a  financing  plan.  The  MFF  modality  will  allow  the \ngovernment (i) a greater degree of certainty on the financing plan, and (ii) to borrow according \nto  project  readiness.  The  MFF  will  also  contribute  to  establishing  a  long-term  partnership \nbetween ADB and Uzbekistan. \n\n10. \nLessons. Implementation of the ongoing ADB-assisted investment program is on track. \nWith advance contracting, physical execution commenced on time and is proceeding smoothly. \nImplementation  of  the  sector  road  map  and  policy  framework  is  also  on  track  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Accelerated  Development  Program.  Implementation  is  smooth  because  (i)  the \nprogram is among the government\u2019s high priorities, and so government commitment is high; it is \nconsistently monitoring physical and nonphysical outputs; and (ii) the executing agency is strong \nand  capable.  The  program  management  unit  (PMU)  has  become  a  source  of  knowledge  and \nadvice  for  project  units  of  other  ADB-financed  projects  in  Uzbekistan.  The  lessons  of  the  first \ninvestment  program  are  that  project  design  should  be  needs-based  and  be  among  the \ngovernment\u2019s highest priorities, and that a strong PMU can lay the foundation for projects and \nsystematically take advance procurement actions. The second investment program incorporates \nthese  lessons.  The  PMU  is  in  place,  the  detailed  design  for  the  first  project  is  complete,  and \nadvance procurement contracting has resulted  in the timely start of the tendering process and \nrecruitment of consultants. An aid coordination group has been constituted at ADB\u2019s initiative to \nensure  coordinated  assistance  for  integrated  transport  sector  development  and  focused \ninstitutional capacity development for optimum and sustained development impacts. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  second  investment  program  will  increase  domestic  and  international  trade.  \n11. \nThe  outcome  will  be  improved  road  connectivity,  safety,  and  effective  management  of  the \nUzbekistan section of CAREC Corridor 2. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  about  236  km  of  the  reconstructed  road  section  of  CAREC \nCorridor  2;  and  (ii)  implemented  road  system  sustainability  plans,  which  relate  to  road  safety \nand  asset  management.  The  investment  program  will  finance  three  separate  projects.  \nThe outputs under each project will be as follows. \n\n                                                \n12 Decree of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  UP-3292 on  improvement  of  the management system  for \n\nconstruction and operation of common-use roads (19 August 2003). \n\n13 ADB.  2007.

The  MFF  will  consist  of  approximately  \n3  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution  of  the  related  loan  agreements  for  each  tranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and \nconditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  government \nhas also requested ADB to consider providing an amount up to $180 million equivalent from its \nSpecial Funds resources for the second tranche under the MFF. Any such ADF financing will be \naccompanied by a corresponding reduction in the OCR financing available, so that in any event \nthe  total  available  amount  under  the  MFF  will  not  exceed $500  million  equivalent. This  will  be \nsubject  to  (i)  the  general  availability  of  ADF  resources,  (ii)  Uzbekistan\u2019s  access  to  such \nresources  pursuant to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy  and the requirements  of  the  ADF donors,  and \n(iii)  the  availability  of  such  resources to  Uzbekistan  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Performance \nBased  allocation  for  ADF  Resources.  In  other  words,  depending  on  the  availability  of  ADF \nresources for Uzbekistan, the second tranche may comprise of OCR and ADF financing.  \n\nFor  project  1,  the  government  has  requested  financing  of  $130  million  equivalent  from \n18. \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  will  submit  the  periodic  financing  request  to  ADB.  \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  $30 million  equivalent  for  the  balance of \nthe  cost,  including for the financing of  local taxes  and  duties.  The first tranche  of the  MFF  will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge of  0.15%  per  year (the  interest  and  other  charges  during construction  will \nnot  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.

The  government  should  also  comply  with  specific \nassurances  for  project  1.  Progress  in  achieving  the  outputs  and  expected  outcomes  in  the \ndesign  and  monitoring  frameworks  for  the  investment  program  and  project  1  will  also  be \ndecision-making criteria for financing subsequent tranches under the MFF. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nManagement \n\n20. \nRRF  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  has  established  a  PMU  and  appointed  a  director \nand a team of nine professional and support staff to implement the first investment program and \nto undertake advance contracting for tranche 1 of the second investment program. The PMU is \nstructured  with  a  specific  mandate:  technical;  legal;  procurement;  monitoring,  reporting,  and \nevaluation; safeguards; and gender development. For the second investment program, RRF will \nadd  seven  more  professionals  (deputy  project  director,  two  road  engineers,  financial \nmanagement specialist, results monitoring specialist, procurement specialist, and accountant) to \nthe PMU. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the facility administration manual (FAM).15 \n\n                                                \n15 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2011\u2013September 2017 \n31 March 2017 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Program management unit  Tashkent, 17 staff \n\nMinistry of Finance \nRepublican Road Fund \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nICB \nICB \nQCBS  \n\n3 contract (works) \n1 contract (goods) \n916 person-months (engineering \nand construction supervision, \ncapacity development, and road \nasset management) \u2013 4 contracts \n98 person-months (road safety) \n\n$420 million \n$500,000 \n$13 million \n\n$1.8 million \n\nQCBS  \nYes.

Design work is complete and advance procurement actions \n21. \nhave been taken. Bids for the major  international competitive bidding civil works contract have \nbeen invited and consultant selection is under way. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nDue  diligence  carried  out  for  project  1  includes  assessing  the  investment  plan,  design \n22. \nfeatures, cost structure for operations, and maintenance requirements. The investment program \nroads  will  carry  heavy  vehicles\u2014from  within  and  outside  Uzbekistan.  The  approach  is  to \nreconstruct four-lane existing asphalt concrete and cement concrete road sections of the A373 \n(project 1), widen the existing two-lane asphalt concrete road sections of the A380 into a four-\nlane  cement  concrete  road  (project  2),  and  widen  the  existing  two-lane  asphalt  concrete  road \nsections  of  the  A373/4R112  into  a  four-lane  asphalt  concrete  road  (project  3),  following  the \nexisting right-of-way. \n\n23. \nRoad traffic is expected to grow by 10% annually to about 108,300 passenger cars daily \nby  2030  for  project  1. The reconstructed  and  expanded  network  can  accommodate  the traffic, \nincluding  growing  intercity  traffic,  but  requires  improved  road  safety  measures.  Best-practice \nstandards are, therefore, included in the investment program. Detailed design work for the road \nsection under project 1 is complete. The investment program is ready for implementation. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic \n\n24. \nThe  second  investment  program  will  benefit  Uzbekistan  as  well  as  its  neighbors.  \nThe  major  benefits  are  better,  safer,  cheaper,  and  faster  connectivity;  lower  transport  costs;  a \ndeveloped  logistics  center;  better  access  to  health  and  education  facilities\u2014all  of  which \ntranslate  into  more  investments  and  jobs.  The  main  beneficiaries  include  people  and  local \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbusinesses, farmer communities, manufacturers, traders, neighboring countries, and Uzbekistan \ncommunities  living  along  the  corridor.  The  link  to  Kazakhstan  in  the  west  and  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic in the east, and the construction of a road from Beyneu to Andizhan deliver substantial \nspillover  benefits  to  all  countries.  The  improved  corridor  will  give  Uzbekistan  and  Central  Asia \ndirect access to the Caspian Sea on the west and access to the PRC via the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n25. \nProject  1  is  economically  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of \n17.3%.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  changes  in  crucial  input  assumptions  was  tested.  \nThe  EIRR  exceeds  12%  for  the  variations  to  all  parameters.  Even  in  the  worst  case,  which \ncombines  a  20%  increase  in  capital  cost  and  a  20%  reduction  in  traffic,  the  EIRR  would \ndecrease to 13.3%, which is favorable compared with the assumed hurdle rate of 12%. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial \n\n26. \nThe  due  diligence  work  analyzed  the  financial  management  aspects  and  maintenance \nrequirements  and  capabilities.  Current  traffic  on  the  road  is  10,000  vehicles/day  for  project  1, \n1,200 for project 2, and 9,200 for project 3. The traffic for projects 1, 2, and 3 is not high enough \nto attract private investors. However, over time, some sections could be handed over to private \noperators,  especially  around  big  cities  and  industrial  zones  like  Navoi.  A  public\u2013private \npartnership framework will be used to access private sector investment. The due diligence work \nindicates that RRF has sound financial management systems, sound systems and procedures, \nand clear accountability lines. \n\n27. \nRRF  has  resources  for  road  maintenance.  The  government  has  been  increasing  its \nbudget  allocation  for  RRF  every  year  and  will  continue  to  do  so  in  line  with  national  tax \ncollections. In 2010, RRF received 32% more than in 2009. The allocation will be inflation-proof. \nThis  will  help  maintain  reasonable  revenue  to  help  sustain  investments.  Generally,  countries \nwith road funds spend about 0.3% of their income on road maintenance. Uzbekistan falls below \nthis now but intends to do better. Uzavtoyul will maintain the road. \n\nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nA governance assessment undertaken as part of the due diligence process focused on \nthe  legal  framework,  regulation,  strength  of  enforcement  regimes,  RRF  capacity,  human \nresources, and the risk of corruption. Uzbekistan\u2019s performance in governance has progressed \nsteadily. The legal frameworks for managing public finances have been tightened. The Budget \nSystem Law and Treasury Law, approved on 17 December 2007, provide additional cover and \nbetter  practices  in  this  area.  The  public  expenditure  reform  process  for  2007\u20132018  includes \nmeasures  to  increase  efficiency,  accountability,  and  transparency.16These  reforms  are  tackling \npublic  financial  management  arrangements,  particularly  with  regard  to  budget  execution.  The \nsecond  investment  program  will  be  subjected  to  international  competitive  bidding  to  increase \noversight and help mitigate corruption.  \n\n29. \nRRF  has  improved  its  systems  and  transparency  by  including  information  on  its \nperformance,  the  status  of  each  contract  under  the  investment  program,  the  specific  list  of \nbusiness opportunities, and a summary of the bidding process and its guidelines on its webpage \nand  the  MOF  website.  An  international  procurement  specialist  has  been  hired  to  assist  in \nprocuring  civil  works,  goods,  and  services;  and  strengthen  RRF  capacity.  An  independent \nauditor will be appointed. \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Public Finance Management Reform Project. Manila (Loan \n2338-UZB)  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  single  treasury  account  and  improvement  of  the  general  financial \nmanagement  information  system.  The  technical  assistance  grant  for  Supporting  Public  Finance  Management \nReform (TA 4946-UZB) reformed the public financial management system. \n\n\fADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith  MOF  and  RRF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed  in  the  FAM.  The  content  of  the  policy,  how  it  needs  to  be  applied,  and  courses  of \naction in case of any infringement are all clear. \n\nE. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe  investment  program  will  not  directly  reduce  household  poverty  or  provide  specific \nservices  that  deal  with  the  geographic  determinants  of  poverty.  Poverty  and  social  analysis \nundertaken  as  part  of  the  due  diligence  process  demonstrates  a  female\u2013male  unemployment \nratio of 6.5:2.5. The poverty rate among households headed by women is 1.5 times higher than \nthose headed by men. Although the second investment program is not a targeted intervention, it \nwill reduce gender inequalities and solve other issues by (i) improving access to health care and \neducation, (ii) creating jobs and developing women\u2019s entrepreneurship skills, and (iii) developing \nroadside  infrastructure  such  as  sanitary  facilities  for  men  and  women  travelers  and  market \nspaces  for  women  entrepreneurs.  Highway  construction  and  the  development  of  long-term \ntransit  routes  may  increase  the  risk  of  sexually  transmitted  infections.  The  government  takes \nthis risk seriously and has agreed to a mitigation plan with ADB. During the execution phase of \nthe investment program, these actions will be reflected in contractors\u2019 contracts, and the gender \naction plan will be implemented in close cooperation with women\u2019s committees. \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nRRF  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the  investment \nprogram  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  investment \nprogram  will  not  have  significant  irreversible  or  permanent  negative  environmental  impacts \nduring  or  after  construction.  Project  1  does  not  have  major  environmental  impacts,  and  is \nclassified  under  environment  category  B  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  RRF \nprepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  for  project  1,  which  includes  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  plan  provides  measures  to  minimize  and  mitigate  potential  adverse \nimpacts.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  initial  environmental \nexamination were posted on ADB's website on 10 June 2011 and on RRF\u2019s website on 11 June \n2011.  \n\n33. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  an  ethnic  minority  planning \nframework  were  also  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  \nThese social safeguard documents were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 10 June 2011 and on \nRRF\u2019s website on 11 June 2011. Civil works under project 1 do not involve land acquisition or \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  or  affect  ethnic  minority  groups  in  all  forms  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. In line with the statement, project 1 is classified as category C for \nthe purposes of social safeguards.  RRF will undertake environmental and social due diligence \nfor  subsequent  tranches  according  to  the  agreed  frameworks,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, and all relevant laws and regulations in Uzbekistan. The PMU will be supported by a \nteam of environment and social safeguard experts to implement the safeguard requirement for \nthe MFF. \n\nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nTable  5  summarizes  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  based  on  lessons  from \nimplementation of the ongoing investment program. Risks relating to cross-border performance \nand  remedial  measures,  including  cross-border  point  investments,  are  part  of  the  first \ninvestment  program.  Overall  mitigation  measures,  integrated  benefits,  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the program costs. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nProgram implementation \ndelays \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProject readiness before approval, including advance contracting \nNo staff changes in the project management unit without ADB approval \n\nRoad system sustainability  Annual road maintenance budget inflation-linked \n\nAdvisory services to review revenues and expenditures, maintenance, and \nindependent quality control systems \nCement concrete pavement requiring less maintenance \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. \n\n36. \nThe government has given ADB certain undertakings for the investment program, which \nare  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.
