It  will  support  capital investment  in  water  companies  and  cofinance  the  National \nNonrevenue  Water  (NRW)  Program.  The  program  will  utilize  an  MFF  to  provide  longer-term \nsupport for institutional reform in the Viet Nam water sector until 2020. The MFF will be used as \nseed  money  to  leverage  parallel  cofinancing  and,  importantly,  gain  access  to  commercial \nfinance and increased private sector participation. Four pilot cities\u2014Da Nang, Haiphong, Ho Chi \nMinh City (HCMC), and Hue\u2014were identified for project preparation in 2008.1 The first periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) will cover HCMC. Subsequent tranches will finance part of the National \nNRW  Program  and  investment  subprograms  consisting  of  water  supply  infrastructure  for \nprovincial  water  companies,  duplicating  the  model  established  with  HCMC  in  PFR1.    Several \ncities  have  initiated  discussions  with  the  government  to  finance  future  tranches  totaling  over \n$300 million for water production plants, transmission and distribution networks. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector  performance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) water and sanitation sector \nassessment  strategy  and  road  map 2  shows  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  water  sector  has  significantly \nimproved coverage since 1995. However, significant gaps remain in the quality and reliability of \nservice.  Areas  requiring  water  companies\u2019  attention  are  (i)  financial  sustainability,  (ii)  the \nefficiency  and  accountability  of  decentralized  sector  institutions,  and  (iii)  data  on  utility  assets \nand performance. The proposed program will address those three areas. Further, NRW in Viet \nNam cities is still unacceptably high, averaging 30% and reaching 40%.3 To meet government \ntargets and improve the financial viability of water companies, considerable effort is required to \nidentify losses and mount a program of massive pipe replacement. ADB will support operational \nwork on distribution networks necessary to identify causes of NRW and finance pipe repair and \nreplacement.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  methodology  promotes  water  company  ownership  of  the  NRW \nreduction program by including NRW as a core target of operation and maintenance.  \n \nPolicy  framework. The policy and legal basis for the sector is relatively strong, as the \n4. \ngovernment  issued  two  key  decisions  detailing  a  clear  vision  and  setting  targets  and \nimplementation  measures.  The  water  supply  decree 4  transforms  water  from  a  social  to  a \ncommercial  commodity  and  requires  water  supply  tariffs  to  be  set  for  full  cost  recovery, \n\n                                                 \n1  The  findings  of  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  were  consolidated  into  the  investment  program:  ADB. \n2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Da Nang Water Supply Project. \nManila  (TA  7144-VIE);  ADB.  2008.

Technical Assistance to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing Hue Water Supply Project. Manila (TA 7089-VIE). \n\n2  The document was completed in June 2010 by the ADB Viet Nam water team.  \n3  NRW is the portion of water produced but not sold because of physical losses from old pipes and poor installation, \ncommercial  losses  from  stolen  water,  defective  meters,  and  non-commercial  uses  such  as  cleaning  and  \nfirefighting. NRW below 20% indicates a very good operation of the distribution network. \n\n4   Decree 117/2007/ND-CP on Clean Water Production, Supply and Consumption \n\n\faddressing  the  main  recommendation5 from  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department.  The \norientation plan for urban water supply6 and the Decision on NRW7 set ambitious targets for the \nwater sector, in particular for reducing NRW to 25% by 2015 and 18% by 2020. The objectives \nof the government\u2019s current socioeconomic development plan, 2006\u20132010 for the water sector \ninclude  providing  essential  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  to  poor  households  in \ncities and towns across the country and enhancing cost recovery for infrastructure investments \nby  setting  and  collecting  appropriate  tariffs  and  fees.  ADB\u2019s  sector  program  in  its  country \nstrategy  and  program,  2007\u20132010  is  consistent  with  these  policies  and  was  confirmed  by  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2009\u20132011  and  the  midterm  review  of  the  country  strategy \nand  program  in  2009. 8 The  strategy  explicitly  aims  to  give  substance  to  the  government\u2019s \ninitiatives  to  decentralize  planning,  financing,  and  decision  making  and  to  support  the  current \nlegal  framework  in  the  water  sector.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  the  water \noperational framework,9 which emphasizes water availability and water security. The investment \nprogram  improves  efficiency  in  the  water  sector  and  addresses  the  supply\u2013demand  gap, \nresource protection, storage improvement, the impact of technology (especially for NRW), and \nhealth through the implementation of water safety plans10 to provide drinking water.  \n \n5. \nMultitranche  financing  facility.  Ongoing  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for \nwater  supply  projects  in  Viet  Nam  highlights  the  need  to  provide  flexible  financing  to  support \nlonger-term,  phased  investment  and  implementation  of  institutional  reform.  As  several  cities \nhave requested ADB financing, a series of stand-alone investment loans would be inadequate. \nA  program  or  sector  loan  would  not  provide  the  necessary  supervision  during  project \nimplementation to address shortcomings in the new legislative framework for the sector. It is too \nearly  to  implement  credit  lines  to  financial  institutions  pending  the  new  legislation  on  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships and the water law.  \n \n6. \nProject  1. HCMC is Viet Nam\u2019s largest city and an important commercial and industrial \ncenter.  Its  population  of  7.1  million  is  growing  by  3.5%  per  annum  and  likely  to  surpass  10 \nmillion  by  2020.  While  Viet  Nam\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  is  growing  by  more  than  8%  per \nannum,  HCMC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  is  growing  substantially  faster,  by  11%.  This  growth \nrate is seriously straining the city\u2019s infrastructure, including the water supply system. In addition, \nHCMC  is  one  of  the  10  cities  in  the  world  likely  to  experience  the  early  impacts  of  climate \nchange, in particular a projected sea level rise of 33 centimeters by 2050. \n \n7. \nSaigon  Water  Corporation  (SAWACO),  set  up  in  1874,  is  Viet  Nam\u2019s  oldest  water \ncompany  and  responsible  for  water  supply  in  HCMC.  It  has  operated  since  2004  as  a  state-\nowned  one-member  company  limited  under  the  Commercial  Law,  2005.  Six  distribution \ncompanies, incorporated as joint stock companies and 51% owned by SAWACO, and two other \ncompanies under SAWACO are in  charge of distribution in HCMC. SAWACO has  proposed a \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB, 2009.

SAWACO has asked ADB to help formulate \na  private  sector  development  framework  during  program  implementation.  The  framework  will \ndefine  which  investments  in  the  $2.8  billion  investment  plan  of  SAWACO  (until  2025)  can  be \nfinanced  by  the  private  sector  as  well  as  improve  the  enabling  environment  to  attract  such \nfinancing. A similar framework will be developed for the other cities to optimize ADB lending.  \n \n8. \nFor Project 1 in HCMC, the water supply system has five major production plants with a \ntotal  capacity  of  1.34  million  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  and  3,800  kilometers  (km)  of \ndistribution  network  with  734,000  connections,  divided  into  six  zones.  The  fundamental \nconstraint on the water supply system is a shortfall in transmission capacity. Actual coverage is \nestimated at 82%, but large areas of HCMC, especially in the south, still suffer intermittent water \nsupply  because  of  low  service  pressure.  The  proposed  investment  program  is  in  line  with \nHCMC\u2019s  draft  master  plan  to  be  approved  in  2011,  whose  objectives  are  to  achieve  universal \ncoverage, continuous water supply, and drinking water quality in HCMC by 2025. \n \nHCMC\u2019s  NRW  is  estimated  at  40%.  The  World  Bank  supports  a  number  of  initiatives \n9. \nunder  way  to  reduce  NRW  in  the  city  center  zones  1  and  2,  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands supports an ongoing Utility Support Program. ADB\u2019s assistance is sought for NRW \nin  the  two  southern  zones  5  and  6.  Private  sector  participation  is  being  explored  for  capital \ninvestment in NRW and the operation and maintenance of the network in the northern zones 3 \nand 4. Two water production plants are operated by the private sector: Binh An, under a build\u2013\noperate\u2013transfer contract and Thu Duc 2, under a build\u2013own\u2013operate contract. \n \nThe investment program will mitigate poverty by improving coverage and the provision of \n10. \nbasic services in HCMC. Addressing the most urgent constraints on SAWACO, it will increase \ndistribution  capacity  to  benefit  475,000  households  in  zones  1  and  3  with  improved  pressure \nand  coverage  by  installing  a  transmission  pipe  with  a  diameter  of  2,400  millimeters  (mm)  for \ntreated water; improve pressure and coverage for 33,872 households in zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 by \nrehabilitating and replacing distribution pipes; provide 13,273 poor households with water supply \nfor the first time and 6,500 poor households that previously shared connections with their own \nconnection  for  first  time;  strengthen  operational  management  through  a  comprehensive \ninformation  and  communication  technology  program;  and  (iii)  support  the  development  of  a \nclimate change action plan and strengthen safeguards for SAWACO.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nbe improved efficiency in Viet Nam\u2019s water companies.   \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  increased  coverage\u2014in  line  with  the  requirement  of  the  draft \nsocioeconomic development plan, 2011\u20132015 and the orientation plan for urban water supply to \n2025 (footnote 6)\u2014from 59% in 2010 to 90% by 2020; (ii) improved business planning through \nthe  drafting of  annual  business  plans,  financial  management  targeting self-financing  ratios11 of \n\nThe impact will be the sustainable provision of safe water in Viet Nam.

The geographic information system \nwill  allow  asset  inventory  and  management,  and  the  management  and  financial  information \nsystems will allow the monitoring of benchmarking and the continuous improvement process.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe government intends to invest $2.78 billion in the Viet Nam water sector by 2020. It \nhas  requested  an  MFF  of  up  to  $1.00  billion  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \nfinance  the  investment.  The  MFF  will  have  several  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's \nsubmission  of  PFRs;  execution  of  loan  and  project  agreements;  and  fulfillment  of  terms, \nconditions,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.

For subsequent tranches, ADB will perform due diligence on feasibility study reports \nfollowing  the  prescribed  format  agreed  between  the  government  and  the  development \npartners.14 ADB  and  the  government  will  appraise  the  proposed  projects  and  discuss  with  the \nMPI and each water company the scheduling and financing plan under each tranche during the \ncountry programming mission and country programming confirmation mission.  \n \n21. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nfacility administration manual for the MFF and the project administration manual for project 1.15  \n \n\n(iii)   Key implementing agencies  Water companies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n \n\nArrangements \nInvestment program: April 2011 \u2013 December 2020 \nProject 1: April  2011 \u2013 December 2015 \n30 June 2021 \n\nMPI, Foreign Economic Relations Department \nProject 1: Saigon Water Corporation, Ho Chi Minh City \nFor subsequent tranches, other water companies \n\nProject management unit set up within the water company, as authorized and \ndefined by Viet Nam legislation \nAll works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nAll consulting services to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \nUnder each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on \nrequest (i) advance contracting and (ii) retroactive financing of up to 10% of the \nproposed individual loan for eligible expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing of the \nrelated legal agreement.  \nLoan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between ADB and the government. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; MFF = multitranche financing facility; MPI = Ministry of Planning and Investment. \nSource: ADB project team. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 Decision  48/2008/QD-TTg  on  Common  General  Guidelines  on  Feasibility  Study  Preparation  for  Official  \n\nDevelopment Assistance Projects. \n\n15 Facility  Administration  Manual;  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period  \n\nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n22. \nIn parallel with the MFF, the project team is processing a series of technical assistance \nand  associated  projects.  A  $1.5  million  capacity  development  technical  assistance  grant  in \n2011\u20132012  will  help  water  companies  participating  in  future  tranches  of  the  MFF  and  water \ncompanies  in  the  Third  Provincial  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project16 improve  their \nefficiency by supporting their preparation of operational business plans and action plans to meet \nagreed  performance  indicators.  The  technical  assistance  will  also  outline  the  National  NRW \nProgram and build capacity in the MPI to coordinate and report on the MFF in 2011 and 2012. \nTwo grants of $2 million each from the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility will finance \ninvestment  to  improve  energy  efficiency  in  2011  and  2012.  Two  grants  of  $3  million  each  will \naddress  water  supply  to  remote  and  rural  locations  in  the  provinces  of  Hue  in  2011  and  Da \nNang in 2012. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nProject  preparation  for  HCMC  was  completed  in  March  2010,  and  due  diligence  has \n23. \nbeen  carried  out  for  project  1.  The  ADB  project  team  set  a  tariff  increase  as  a  condition  for \nappraisal. After 6 years without any tariff review, HCMC pushed through a long overdue water \ntariff increase of 48% that became effective in March 2010, with further annual increases of 10% \nuntil  2013.  The  road  map  for  water  tariffs  in  HCMC  will  be  revised  at  the  midterm  review  in \n2013.  \n \n24. \nAs  the  investment  program  will  be  financed  through  loans from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  for  the  first  time  in  the  water  sector  in  Viet  Nam,  participating  water  companies  will \nneed to demonstrate a strong commitment to institutional reform. The primary selection criterion \nfor projects to be financed in subsequent tranches is a demonstrated commitment to operating \nat  full  cost  recovery  through  water  tariff  reform  (including  an  increased  water  tariff,  an \nagreement  on  a  water  tariff  road  map,  and  the  phasing  out  of  subsidies  and  direct  charges) \nlinked  to  hard  targets  for  selected  performance  indicators.  Other  selection  criteria  are  a \ncommitment to national water policies such as (i) agreement on a service contract and business \nplan; (ii) NRW reduction by 10% over 10 years, or to 18% by 2020; (iii) over 90% coverage in \nurban areas and 70% in rural areas by 2020; and (iv) implementation of water safefy plans from \nWorld Health Organization, in order to provide access to safe water. \n \nA. \n \n25. \nSAWACO  is  completing  detailed  design  of  the  $57.5  million  10  km,  2,400  mm \ntransmission  pipe,  with  construction  to  start  as  soon  as  the  loan  is  declared  effective  or  to  be \nfinanced  retroactively  if  loan  effectiveness  is  delayed.  The  framework  financing  agreement \nprovides  selection  criteria  for  projects\u2019  eligibility  for  financing  under  the  MFF,  which  include \nfeasibility study reports being vetted and approved by the government and ADB. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nFinancial and economic analyses have been done for project 1 in HCMC. The financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  8.7%,  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.44%.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the first tranche is 24.5%, well above the social opportunity \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nTechnical \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (Loan \n1880-VIE). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ncost of capital of 12%. Sensitivity analysis indicates good financial and economic internal rates \nof return (reduced to 6% and 17%, respectively) under a 2-year delay in project implementation \nand increase in capital cost of 20%. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nSAWACO\u2019s  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  have  been  assessed.  A \nproject administration manual has been completed for project 1, as has a facility administration \nmanual for the MFF. PMU staff for projects 1 and 2 have started training on ADB systems and \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement, which will continue in 2011.  \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the MPI and \nSAWACO.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nfacility  administration  manual  for  the  MFF  and  the  project  administration  manual  for  project  1 \n(footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nHCMC\u2019s overall poverty rate of 12% disguises poverty rates of more than 50% in some \nwards  and  districts.  The  urban  poor  are  both  long-term  residents  and  migrant  households. \nSurveys  show  a  low  incidence  of  waterborne  disease.  Satisfaction  with  SAWACO\u2019s  service  is \ngood  overall,  despite  some  dissatisfaction  because  of  poor  water  quality.  Among  households \nconnected to piped water, 84% have individual connections, 12% shared connections with their \nown meter, and 4% shared connections with a shared meter. Many households buy water from \ntankers  and  pay  almost  twice  the  official  water  tariff  of  D4,000\u2013D10,000  per  cubic  meter. \nAlthough  policy  dictates  free  connections,  the  tertiary  distribution  network  is  obviously  lacking \nand will be extended under the program by the component that rehabilitates and replaces pipes. \n \nThe  social  assessment  concluded  that  information  dissemination,  education,  and \n30. \ncommunication are required at the ward level. The social development services subcomponent \nunder project 1 aims to increase community participation in water supply services. The focus will \nbe on strengthening the role of the ward-level community supervision boards in project areas by \nimproving  members\u2019  knowledge  of  the  water  supply  system  and  proposed  works,  including \nresettlement,  improving  capacity  in  community  participation  and  monitoring,  and  improving \ncoordination among members.  \n \nProject 1 is categorized as effective in gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment in \n31. \nHCMC during preparation for project 1 found that women play a key role in ensuring that water \nis  available  in  the  home,  collecting  and  paying  for  water,  and  teaching  children  about  water \nconservation.  The  Women\u2019s  Union  is  neither  formally  included  in  any  water  decision-making \nbody  nor  consulted  by  SAWACO.  Key  gender  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  project  include \n(i) the  gender  and  poverty  implications  of  water  access  and  usage;  (ii)  women\u2019s  increased \ninvolvement  in  water  utility  agencies,  community  supervision  boards,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance; and (iii) sex-disaggregated data on poverty and water supply access. \n \nProject 1 includes a gender action plan17 that ensures (i) the development of a road map \n32. \nfor  water  tariff  increases  that  considers  gender  and  affordability  issues;  (ii)  network  extension \ncovers 100% of households headed by women in project areas; (iii) the implementation of the \nwater  supply  decree  (footnote  5)  to  ensure  lifeline  tariff  and  free  connections  are  provided  to \n                                                 \n17 The  gender  action  plan  will  be  implemented  through  the  safeguard  component  under  a  social  development \n\nservices subcomponent. \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\n100%  of  households  headed  by  women,  as  part  of  water  for  all;  (iv)  women\u2019s  priority \nemployment in operation and maintenance at the commune or ward level; (v) the participation of \nwomen  and  the  Women\u2019s  Union  in  ward  committees;  (vi)  gender-sensitive  information \ndissemination,  education,  and  communication  using  community  women  as  facilitators  for \ntraining  delivery;  (vii)  that  50%  of  newly  recruited  PMU  staff  are  women  and  that  equal \nemployment  and  training  opportunities  are  provided  to  women  through  the  project;  and  (viii) \nimproved  gender  awareness  through  the  training  of  directors  of  SAWACO,  its  distribution \ncompanies,  the  PMU,  and  consultants  and  the  inclusion  in  the  project  monitoring  system  of  a \nsex-disaggregated database. \n \nE. \n \nThe project is classified category B as resettlement is largely limited to where the 2,400 \n33. \nmm  treated  water  pipeline  will  be  constructed,  together  with  road  widening.  Pipe  replacement \nand  extension  will  use  existing  rights  of  way,  where  possible.  Conventional  civil  works  will  be \nemployed to lay the 2,400 mm pipeline in three sections of the selected corridor. A resettlement \nframework was prepared, instead of a resettlement plan, because the alignment and routing of \nthe  pipelines  will  be  finalized  only  during  detailed  design.  The  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement  plan  for  one  subcomponent  was  prepared  according  to  government  regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and in consultation with local communities and \nauthorities.  The  cost  estimates  include  the  provision  of  $0.6  million  for  resettlement  cost  and \n$250,000 for monitoring and evaluating resettlement. \n \n34. \nThe project is classified category B for environmental impacts. An initial environmental \nexamination was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement to assess \npotential  environmental  impacts  and  propose  mitigation  and  institutional  arrangements.  It \nindicates  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  insignificant.  The  PMU  will  prepare  an \nannual  monitoring  report  for  submission  to  the  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment for endorsement before submission to ADB. \n \n35. \nEthnic  minority  households  are  well  integrated  into  mainstream  urban  society  in  all \naspects  of  life,  including  language,  clothing,  housing,  and  economic  activities.  The  project  is \ncategorized C, since it will have positive impacts on ethnic minorities, as it improves access to \nwater. \n \n36. \nPreparation  of  future  tranches  preparation  will  be  guided  by  the  safeguard  framework \ndocuments18 and  loan  fact-finding  missions  will  secure  the  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement for each tranche.  \n \nF. \n \n37. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe major risks are as follows:  \n(i) \n\nThe  central  and  local  governments  may  delay  processing  because  of  the \nstructuring of this first sectoral MFF in Viet Nam and the new decision (footnote \n14)  defining  a  new  format  for  feasibility  studies  for  projects  financed  by  official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA), which was not well received by local government \nagencies or ministries. The project team asked the MPI to help build awareness \nin local governments of the new requirement for feasibility study reports.  \n\n                                                 \n18  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework;  Resettlement  Framework;  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning \n\nFramework; and a Gender Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nLocal governments may fail to enforce water tariff increases for full cost recovery, \nthreatening  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  investment  program.  Substantial \ntariff increases, a road map to full cost recovery, and the phasing out of subsidies \nto comply with Viet Nam legislation are conditions for subprojects\u2019 qualifying for \nfinancing under the MFF.  \nThe equitization of water companies without adequate oversight will not improve \nservice delivery. Without a service contract or a business plan, water companies \nare  accountable  only  to  make  a  best  effort.  Another  regulatory  issue  is  water \ncompanies venturing outside their core business into high-risk investments such \nas real estate. Under the MFF, water companies will ring-fence the accounts for \nwater  operation  and  report  in  a  transparent  manner  performance  data,  as  a \nprecondition to attract investment capital from ODA or the private sector. \nPolitical  interference  can  undermine  successful  implementation  and  financial \nsustainability. The project will strengthen awareness through high-level advocacy \nof  the  benefits  of  reliable  water  supply  and  financially  strong  and  accountable \nwater companies in Viet Nam and the region. \nDecentralization  and  granting  greater  autonomy  to  local  government  agencies \nand utilities are not matched with improved accountability to consumers or higher \nlevels  of  government.  The  project  performance  management  system  introduces \nnew  meaningful  indicators  on  financial  sustainability.  The  government  is \nimplementing  benchmarking  through  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  the  Viet \nNam Water Supply and Sewerage Association. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n38. \nThe government, the MPI, and SAWACO have assured ADB that implementation of the \ninvestment  program  and  project  1 shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n39. \nThe government and the MPI have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, as set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government, the \nMPI, and water companies with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be set forth in \nthe loan agreement and project agreement for each tranche.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n40. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $1,000,000,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Water \nSector  Investment  Program  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing \nagreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n31 January 2011 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nSustainable provision \nof safe water in Viet \nNam \n\nOutcome \nEfficiency of water \nsupply companies \nimproved  \n\nOutputs  \n1.
