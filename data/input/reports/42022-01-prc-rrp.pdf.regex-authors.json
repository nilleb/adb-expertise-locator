I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi \nSustainable Forest Ecosystem Development Project.1 \n2.  To  support  its  development  policies  and  plans,  the  project  will  help  the  People\u2019s \nGovernment  of  Jiangxi  Province  (JPG)  improve  the  productivity  of  the  forestry  sector, \ndemonstrate an ecosystem-based forest-development approach, and introduce forest carbon-\nsequestration and climate change-mitigation measures.2 Key outputs of the project will include \n(i)  sustainable  forest  plantation  development  and  rehabilitation  on  50,900  hectares  (ha)  of \nbarren and low-yielding forestlands, (ii) strengthening forest insurance for natural risk mitigation, \n(iii) capacity development for sustainable forest management, and (iv) project management \nsupport.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The PRC has a forest deficit despite forest cover of 175 million ha and a standing timber \nstock of 12.5 billion cubic meters (m3). The forested area per capita is only 0.13 ha, well below \nthe world average of 0.65 ha. The standing stock volume amounts to less than 10 m3 per capita, \nwhich is significantly lower than the world average of 66 m3. Since the 1980s, the government \nhas adopted a series of policy reforms to address the issues of forest resource conservation \nand ecosystem restoration, shifting its forestry policy from resource exploitation to resource \nprotection. The PRC\u2019s forest cover has since increased to 18.2% with extensive plantation \ndevelopment programs. Rapid economic growth over the last 2 decades has escalated the \ncountry\u2019s demand for forest products, including wood fiber, which has put pressure on forests in \nother parts of the developing world and raised concerns regarding global climate change. \n \n4.  Forestation to sequester carbon is a key action the government cites in China\u2019s Policies \nand Actions for Addressing Climate Change.3 The government established the Green Carbon \nFund in 2007 to promote carbon sequestration in forests and help domestic enterprises achieve \nvoluntary emission reductions. The State Forestry Administration is developing guidelines for \ncarbon  accounting  and  monitoring,  which  will  be  used  to  gauge  and  register  carbon \nsequestration by forestry projects. Based on the State Forestry Administration\u2019s assessment, \nJiangxi Province meets the criteria for developing forest carbon stock4 and is on the list of \nregions where promoting carbon sequestration projects is prioritized.  \n \n5.  Project area. The project will take place in 23 counties of 8 cities in Jiangxi Province, \nwhich is mountainous and underdeveloped. The provincial gross domestic product per capita \nwas CNY14,727 in 2008, one-third less than the national average. About 5% of the population \nlives below the national rural poverty line of CNY1,067 per year. Of the 23 project counties, 15 \nare classified as national or provincial poverty counties. Forestry plays an important role in \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance ($700,000, approved in \nNovember 2008). \n3  Information Office of the State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2008. China\u2019s Policies and Actions for \nAddressing Climate Change. Beijing. \n4  The criteria include forest growth rate, potential for biodiversity conservation, plantation cost, and per capita \nincome. ", "2   \nJiangxi\u2019s economic development and environmental sustainability. The sector\u2019s gross output \nincreased fivefold during 2000\u20132008 to reach CNY76 billion in 2008, which is 14% of the \nprovincial gross domestic product. About 10.6 million ha, or 62.5% of the provincial area, is \ndesignated forestland, of which 1.5 million ha is barren or low yielding. The provincial forest \nstock is 353.5 million m3, an average of 34.4 m3/ha, much lower than the national average of \n76.0 m3/ha and the world average of 99.8 m3/ha.  \n \n6.  Sector performance, problems, and opportunities. Jiangxi Province is an important \nsource of wood and bamboo, accounting for 7% of the PRC\u2019s wood production and 8% of its \nbamboo production in 2008. In Jiangxi, forests logs are mainly used as sawn timber, veneer, \nand fiberboard for domestic uses. Resin and a variety of chemical products are other products \nof forest materials. In 2008, the consumption of forest products was 7.6 million m3, and demand \nfor raw timber was 6 million m3. Currently, the province produces only 4.6 million m\u00b3 of timber \nand meets the deficit with imports from abroad and neighboring provinces. The government \nforesees an increase in demand as many wood-processing enterprises in Jiangxi expand their \nproduction capacity or plan to do so.5   \n \n7.  The  JPG  has  established  a  long-term  forestry-development  plan  to  meet  provincial \ndemand for forest products and improve its forest ecosystem. The plan aims to promote public \nand private investments in forestry to increase forest coverage from 60.05% to 63%, forest \nstock to 750 million m3, average production to 90 m3/ha, and total forestry output to CNY160 \nbillion  by  2020.  To  promote  forestry  development  in  the  province,  the  JPG  launched  its \nforestland tenure reform program in 2004 and, in 2008, distributed the management rights of 8.6 \nmillion ha of collective forestlands to 10 million farm households. The JPG further issued a \nprovincial order to develop trading centers for forestry property rights in counties to provide \nservices  to  forest  farmers  and  the  private sector  regarding  forestland  tenure  and  property \nregistration, legal consultation, and the trading of forestry properties and products. Reform has \nresulted  in remarkable  effects  on  forestry  development:  (i)  prices  for  forest  products  have \nincreased significantly, (ii) a market for leasing forestland is developing and growing, and (iii) \nprivate forest enterprises and household forest enterprises are emerging. \n \n8.  The core problem of the Jiangxi forestry sector is the fragility of its forest ecosystem, \nwhich cannot satisfy the social and economic development needs of the province. Major causes \nof the problem include (i) the underutilization of forestlands for lack of investment funds or \naccess to credit, (ii) the historical overexploitation of forest resources, (iii) communities\u2019 lack of \nknowledge of or skill in forest management, and (iv) the lack of institutional experience in \nsustainable forest management. The underutilization of forestland has significantly damaged the \nenvironment, causing soil erosion, siltation in rivers and lakes, and the deterioration of water \nquality and reservation.  \n \n9.  Development  coordination. International development partners have supported the \nefforts of the Government of the PRC and the JPG toward forestry development since the early \n1990s, which has improved forest cover in the province. After the logging ban and speedy \neconomic  growth  since  then,  and  considering  the  challenges  of  climate  change  that  the \ninternational community faces, the government and international development partners support \nsector  development  to (i)  meet  growing  domestic  demand  for  forest  products  to  ease  the \npressure on forest resources in other developing countries, (ii) improve forest management \nknowledge and practices to enhance the environmental value of forests, and (iii) introduce \n                                                 \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "                      3\ninnovative practices to strengthen forest carbon storage and access additional financing for \nforestation, such as carbon financing and forest insurance.6 The project is in line with the PRC \ncountry partnership strategy, 2008\u201320107 and the development strategies of both the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project impact will be improved sustainable forest management that enhances forest \nproduction, environmental benefits, and rural livelihoods in Jiangxi Province. The project will \nhelp the JPG achieve its long-term forestry-development goals, contribute to the sequestration \nof  150,000  tons  of  carbon  per  year  through  afforestation  and  reforestation,  and  develop \ninstitutional capacity in Jiangxi to mitigate climate change and enhance the environmental \nbenefits of forests. The project outcome will be improved forest cover and rural livelihoods in the \nproject area. It is estimated that the forest cover in the project area will expand by 1% after the \ncompletion of the project planting, 9 million m3 of timber will be produced, and 6 million labor-\ndays of employment will be created. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Output 1: Sustainable forest plantation development and rehabilitation. The project \nwill develop 35,700 ha of timber plantation on barren forestland to improve forest productivity \nand help meet local demand for construction materials and other wood products. Major timber \nspecies include Chinese fir and slash pine. Broadleaf trees will be planted in fire protection belts \nto improve ecological biodiversity and multiply the functions of the timber plantation. The project \nwill also rehabilitate 11,200 ha of low-yielding and snowstorm-damaged bamboo forests. Ninety-\ntwo forest farms, 34 forest enterprises, 190 large households, 200 united households, and 5,100 \nindividual households9  will participate directly in plantation activities. The project will support \nfarmers\u2019 planting of broadleaf species mixed with bamboo groves to protect them from climate-\nrelated disasters, pests, and disease. The project will also support farmers\u2019 establishment of \n4,000  ha  of  economic  tree  crops,  including  orange,  tea  tree  oil,  and  tea,  to  improve  the \nproductivity of project land and rural households\u2019 income.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Strengthening forest insurance for natural risk mitigation. The project will \nprovide 35,700 ha of timber plantation to improve the resilience of forest farmers and forest \nenterprises and support the government\u2019s initiative to establish insurance to protect the forestry \nsector from natural risks. The insurance output follows the forest insurance initiative that has \nbeen piloted in the PRC since 2009. The premium for commercial forests is about CNY1.20 per \nmu, or 0.15% of the CNY800 that is the average forest value per mu.10 The total premium for \nthe insured area will be CNY0.64 million per year. The government will subsidize 60% of the \npremium, and the forest farmers will bear the remaining 40%. Insurance for timber plantations \nwill  start  in  the  fourth  year  of  project  implementation.  The  project  will  organize  training \nworkshops to raise awareness of the impacts of natural risks on forest development and ways to \nmitigate them. \n                                                 \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2008.

The People\u2019s Insurance Company (Group) of China is assigned by the JPG as the sole \npromoter  of  the  insurance  policy  because  the  company  is  the  largest  property  insurance \ncompany in the PRC and has many branch offices and service stations in rural Jiangxi to serve \nforest farmers. The company will support project workshops by providing resource persons. \nAwareness-raising training and capacity development will open up opportunities for dialogue \namong stakeholders and are expected to facilitate the improvement of the forest insurance \npolicy and, consequently, its sustainability in the PRC. \n \n14.  Output 3: Capacity development for sustainable forest management. The project \nwill introduce an ecosystem management approach to the development and management of \nforest resources that requires changes in farmers\u2019 behavior and the adaptation of new plantation \nskills  and  techniques.  The  project  will  implement  a  training  and  extension  program  to \ndisseminate sustainable forest management concepts and corresponding technical silvicultural \nguidelines to project staff and beneficiaries to improve farmers\u2019 forestation practices for more \nprofit and sustainability. The training will involve existing forestry and agriculture extension \nnetworks in counties and townships, with the project supporting a program to train trainers. A \ngrant of $1 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund (CCF) to support capacity \ndevelopment.  The  grant  will  (i)  demonstrate  and  establish  a  monitoring,  verification,  and \nreporting system following State Forestry Administration guidelines to improve the forest carbon \nstock in Jiangxi and (ii) pilot sustainable forest management in selected project counties to \nimprove forest composition and production.  \n \n15.  Output 4: Project management support. The project will establish an adequate project \norganization at the three levels of forest administration\u2014provincial, county, and township\u2014\nsupported by the corresponding guiding, advisory, and control bodies. Training will enable the \nstaff  of  the  project  management  office  (PMO),  project  implementation  offices,  and  the \ncorresponding forest administration units to manage the project following the financial and \ntechnical management standards of ADB and the government, as they support beneficiaries in \nthe  implementation  of  afforestation  through  technical  and  administrative  assistance.  Major \nactivities will include (i) developing and implementing domestic training programs for project \nstaff and (ii) preparing and disseminating training materials. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n16.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $66.39  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$4.12 million to be financed by the government. The investment cost comprises a base cost of \n$57.58 million, contingencies of $4.70 million, and financing charges during implementation of \n$4.11 million. The base cost will mainly support output 1 with $53.45 million. The investment \ncost of output 2, $0.27 million, will be financed by the JPG and beneficiaries to pay insurance \npremiums for 35,700 ha of timber plantation. The investment cost of outputs 3 and 4 is mainly \nfor capacity building and project management activities, to be sourced from the ADB loan \nproceeds, beneficiaries\u2019 counterpart funds, and the CCF grant of $1.00 million. The investment \nplan is summarized in Table 1.

On behalf of the \nborrower, the Ministry of Finance will make the proceeds of the loan available to JPG for \nonlending to project beneficiaries through the city or county finance bureaus with the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed from \nthe provincial finance department through the municipal and county finance bureaus to project \nbeneficiaries, who will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks. The loan \nfunds transfer arrangements and indicative funds flow of the loan proceeds and CCF grant are \nprovided in the project administration manual. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The project will be implemented over 6 years from 1 May 2011 to 30 April 2017. The \nJPG, represented by the Jiangxi Forestry Department (JFD), will be the executing agency. The \nproject county or district governments will be the implementing agencies. The JPG will set up a \nproject  leading  group  to  provide  policy  guidance  for  project  implementation.  The  JFD  will \nestablish  a  PMO  in  its  foreign  fund  utilization  office  to  take  charge  of  day-to-day  project \nmanagement. The PMO comprises eight regular staff, including two finance officers and three \nproject officers. Each participating county will establish a project implementation office led by \nthe director of each county forestry bureau. \n \n20.  All procurement under the ADB loan and CCF grant will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Major  procurement  items  will  include \nseedlings and labor for forestation. The procurement of these items will follow established \ncommercial  practices,  with  an  assessment  carried  out  during  project  preparation  found \nacceptable to ADB. Individual consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The disbursement of loan proceeds \nand the CCF grant will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, amended from time \nto time). The local Digital Forestry Center will conduct surveys for forest carbon measurement. \nThe center is a subsidiary of the Jiangxi Academy of Forest Inventory and Planning and is the \nonly organization in the province that specializes in applying geographical information systems \nto the mapping and managing of forest resources. Selected center staff can be further trained to \nestablish the monitoring, verification, and reporting system and carbon sink monitoring. To \nensure that capacity will be developed and retained in the province, the center will participate in \nthe capacity development component and conduct surveys.  \n \n21.  The JPG requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for the procurement of \nseedlings and labor before loan effectiveness (but not more than 1 year prior to the signing of \nthe loan and project agreements) to cope with seasonal constraints on plantation development. \nThe amount of retroactive financing is estimated to be $8 million, which is 20% of the loan \namount.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.13 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic and financial analysis was carried out for the total project and for each forest \ntype. Financial and institutional sustainability were also analyzed and confirmed. The sensitivity \nanalysis confirmed that the project benefits and returns are robust.14 The economic internal rate \nof return for the whole project is estimated at 20.7%, and the economic net present value is \nCNY514.9 million over a 25-year period of analysis. All forest types have attractive economic \n                                                 \n14  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \ninternal rates of return: 19% for investments in commercial forests, 24.6%\u201332.0% for economic \nforests, and 21.5% for bamboo forests. These values are above the currently accepted hurdle \nrate of 12%. \n \n23.  The financial internal rate of return for the whole project is estimated at 17.4%, and the \nfinancial net present value is CNY2.53 billion. The financial internal rate of return is 15.9% for \ncommercial  forests,  20.6%\u201324.9%  for  economic  forests,  and  19.7%  for  bamboo  forests. \nCalculations for individual forest types include (i) the costs of materials and equipment, such as \nseeds and seedlings, fertilizers and pesticides, manure, equipment hire, and tools; (ii) labor \ncosts  for  site  clearing,  preparation,  planting,  tending,  road  maintenance,  guardhouse \nconstruction, and harvesting; and (iii) all relevant provincial and national taxes and fees. \n \nB.  Governance \n24.  The JFD, the Jiangxi Finance Department, and implementing agencies have adequate \ncapacity for financial management, including undertaking procurement, providing counterpart \nfunds, and organizing loan repayments. The project beneficiaries, comprising individual farmers, \nenterprises, and forest farms, generally have satisfactory capacity for financial management and \nloan  repayment.  The  JFD  lacks  direct  experience  with  ADB  project  management  but  is \nexperienced in managing projects funded by other multilateral and bilateral agencies. The \nproject  will  provide  training  to  project  staff  on  ADB  project  administration,  particularly  on \nprocurement and disbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  JFD  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  An  estimated  25,500  rural  households  will  benefit  from  the  project,  with  5,500 \nhouseholds  increasing  their  income  by  participating  directly  in  afforestation  and  bamboo \nrehabilitation  and  20,000  households  benefiting  indirectly  from  the  project  by  leasing  their \nforestland to others. The 20,000 households will lease out 24,000 ha of land for a total of CNY9 \nmillion per year.15 The households can opt for different leasing arrangements, such as profit-\nsharing. Training on the advantages and disadvantages of various leasing arrangements will be \nprovided to farmers to enable them to choose the best way to sustain their livelihood. The \ntraining will encourage farmer leasers to participate in forest management to enhance their \nforestland-management  knowledge  and  skills.  Project  implementation  will  create  6  million \nperson-days of employment.  \n \n26.  The  gender  analysis  indicated  that  the  project  faces  issues  regarding  women\u2019s \ninsufficient participation in decision making. Forestry is dominated by males because it involves \nheavy work and requires long hours away from the village. Under the proposed project, women \nwill (i) participate in household decision making for land-lease arrangements, (ii) benefit from the \nplanting and management of economic trees close to the village, and (iii) receive livelihood \ntraining.  Women  will  be  able  to  sign  agreements  related  to  the  project,  particularly  lease \nagreements.  \n \n \n                                                 \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "                      9\nD.  Safeguards \n1.  Environmental Assessment  \n \n27.  The project is environmental category B. The executing agency prepared a domestic \nenvironmental assessment report, which was approved by the Jiangxi provincial environmental \nprotection  department  on  14  December  2009.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The initial environmental examination indicates that the project is expected to \nachieve significant environmental benefits, including (i) annual carbon sequestration equivalent \nto 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, (ii) soil erosion reduction by 100,000 tons per year, (iii) \nannual  water  conservation  of  19  million  m3,  and  (iv) improved  habitats  and  increased \nbiodiversity in the ecosystems of previously bare mountains and slopes. Adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  limited  to  minor  construction  impacts  such  as  the  risk  of  erosion  during  the \npreparation of planting sites and minor construction, as well as forest fires. It is expected that \nthese adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level by \nimplementing the environmental management and monitoring plan.16  \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n28.  The project is categorized as C for both involuntary resettlement (IR) and indigenous \npeoples (IP), and will need no IR or IP plan following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nJPG will ensure that no land acquisition or change of land use will occur. Land for reforestation \nhas already been classified as forestland and distributed to users. The executing agency has \nprovided  assurances  that  all  land-lease  arrangements  with  smallholders,  directly  or  by \nenterprises, will be voluntary and implemented in an equitable and transparent way, so that they \nwill not harm people\u2019s livelihoods. No ethnic minority communities live in the project area. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks of the project include price fluctuations for forest products; climate disasters, \nforest fires, plant pathogens, or pests that may affect the quality of forest products; farmers\u2019 \nadherence to outmoded forestation practices; poor quality seeds and seedlings; and the lack of \ntimely counterpart funds. The major risks and their mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4. Overall, the integrated benefits are expected to outweigh the costs.17 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPrice fluctuations for forest  Project design and implementation allow flexibility to cope with market changes. \nproducts \nFarmers diversify to commercial tree species and adopt flexible harvesting plans. \nClimate disasters, forest fires,  Taking out forest insurance is one of the selection criteria for project beneficiaries. \nand plant pathogens affect the \nClimate change mitigation measures will be demonstrated through Climate Change \nquantity and quality of \nFund grant assistance \nproducts  \nFarmers adhere to old  Awareness-raising training on sustainable forest management will be provided. \nforestation practices \nThe outcome of the sustainable forest management practices will be disseminated. \n                                                 \n16  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nUnavailability of high-quality  Inspection plans will be executed at various plantation stages to ensure the use of \nseeds and seedlings  certified, high-quality seeds and seedlings, with funds released based on \ndevelopment progress made and outputs achieved. \nLack of timely counterpart  The financial status of participating farms and farmers will be reviewed before \nfunds  entering into onlending agreements \nProvincial and county governments provide guarantees.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n30.  The Government of the PRC and the JPG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies and guidelines, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and the JPG have assured ADB that all forestland leasing and other \nforestland transactions are voluntary. \n \n32.  The government and the JPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the  loan  of  $40,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Jiangxi \nSustainable Forest Ecosystem Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with  interest  to  be  determined  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 26 years, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  from  ADB\u2019s  Climate  Change  Fund  for  the  Jiangxi  Sustainable  Forest \nEcosystem Development Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 October 2010 ", "    Appendix 1  11\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2020    Assumptions \nImproved  Forest coverage in Jiangxi  JPG\u2019s annual statistical  Government policy \nsustainable forest  province reached 63%  reports  continues to support \nmanagement that  forest development. \nForest stand stock reached 750  Local governments\u2019 \nenhances forest \nmillion m3  statistical reports  The JPG and local \nproduction, \ngovernments remain \nenvironmental  150,000 tons of carbon  Project administration \ncommitted to forest \nbenefits, and rural  sequestrated each year  missions and project \ndevelopment. \nlivelihoods in  completion report \nA forest carbon monitoring, \nJiangxi Province  Sustainable forest \nverification, and reporting system  Executing agency\u2019s pre- \nmanagement benefits \n  adopted in Jiangxi Province  and post-evaluation \nrural communities \nsurveys and reports \nand enhances rural \ndevelopment. \nOutcome  By 2018    Assumptions \nImproved forest  Forest coverage in the project  Annual statistical  Key stakeholders are \ncover and rural  area increased by 1%  reports of forestry  committed to forest \nlivelihoods in the  bureaus  investment. \nTea tree oil yield increased from \nproject area \n225 kg/ha to 525 kg/ha   Statistical reports of   Forestland is \ncounty forestry bureaus  available. \nOrange yield reached 22,500 \nkg/ha  Performance monitoring  Sufficient counterpart \nreports of county  funds are available.  \nTea leaf yield reached 3,000 \nforestry bureaus \nkg/ha  Risks \nUp to 6 million person-days of  The market for forest \njobs created for villagers, of which  products changes. \nat least 15% are for women  \nNatural disasters, \n20,000 households received  forest fires, plant \nCNY9 million annually in rent and  pathogens, or pests \nprofit share from land leasing  destroy forests. \nOutputs  By 2017    Assumption \n1.
