I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the North Eastern State Roads Investment \nProgram.1 The report also describes proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity  Building  for  North  Eastern  State  Roads  Sector,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The investment program will (i) improve about 430 kilometers (km) of priority roads in six \nstates (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, and Tripura) in the northeastern region \n(NER) of India, and (ii) provide capacity building support to the executing agencies: the Ministry \nof Development of North Eastern Region (MDONER) and the state public works departments \n(PWDs) or its equivalent in the six project states.2 The investment program will target the \nsecondary road network and aim to enhance the performance of state roads sector in NER \nthrough  investment  project  implementation  and  dedicated  capacity  building  measures.  The \nimproved  secondary  road  network  will  provide  important  linkage  between  the  primary  and \ntertiary  road  networks  in  the  region,  for  which  there  are  ongoing  national  programs  for \nimprovement.      \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  NER  forms  a  distinct  geographical  unit,  representing  about  8%  of  the  country\u2019s \ngeographic area. It has a population of about 39 million (about 4% of the country\u2019s population).3 \nApproximately  98%  of  NER's  borders  are  with  other  countries\u2014Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  the \nPeople's Republic of China, Myanmar, and Nepal. Its connection with the rest of the country is \nonly  through  a  narrow  land  corridor.  Except  in  Assam,  NER  has  predominantly  hilly  to \nmountainous terrain and very high rainfall (among the highest in the world), which frequently \nresults in landslides and floods.  \n \n4.  Recognizing the need for accelerated development, the Government of India places \nspecial focus on the development of NER in its five-year plans, mainly through central funding of \ndevelopment activities in the region. Over the last two decades the government has required \n10% of the budgets of central ministries and departments to be allocated for NER, and created \na funding mechanism for pooling the unspent allocated central funds for further assistance to \nthe region. However, the recent growth performance of these states has not been encouraging.  \nThe government\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012 states that \u201cwhile development efforts \nover the years have made some impact (as reflected in some of the human development \nindicators, which are comparable with the rest of the country), the region is deficit in physical \ninfrastructure which has a multiplier effect on economic development.\"4 \n \n5.  The  government  created  a  dedicated  ministry\u2014MDONER\u2014to  coordinate  and  give \nimpetus to the various central development efforts. MDONER responsibilities include dealing \nwith matters relating to the planning, execution, and monitoring of development schemes and \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2004. Technical \nAssistance to India for Preparing the North Eastern State Roads Project. Manila. \n3   Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs. Census 2001. New Delhi. \n4 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008. Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201312. New Delhi. ", "2       \n \nprojects in the region including those for roads and administering the non-lapsable central pool \nof resources.   \n \n6.  With  the  limited  exception  of  the  highest  class  roads  (mostly  national  highways \nmaintained by central organizations5), the NER road network needs substantial improvement, \nthrough its expansion and improvement of individual road sections. The latter will be by way of \nwidening the existing roadway, strengthening pavements, improving road geometry, raising \nembankments, and providing permanent structures at river-crossings. The capacity of the state \nPWDs, which maintain the secondary road network, needs substantial strengthening, and their \nstaff needs exposure to modern project management and asset management practices, which \nis currently lacking due to limited private sector involvement in road infrastructure development.  \n \n7.  With renewed recognition that inadequate roads and bridges supporting road transport, \nthe region\u2019s single most dominant transport mode, are the major constraints on development \nefforts, the government started a national investment program to improve road connectivity to \nremote places in the region. The Special Accelerated Road Development Program in the North \nEastern Region (SARDP-NE) is to improve higher class roads including national highways and \nstate roads in the region, and provide connectivity to the state capitals and district headquarters \nin NER by developing two-lane national highways and improving state roads.6  \n \n8.  The present investment program was developed in parallel with SARDP-NE and is \ncomplementary to it. While SARDP-NE focuses on improving higher class roads, the investment \nprogram is developed to improve intrastate connectivity, mainly to district headquarters and \nother places of administrative and economic importance in the individual states, and to enhance \ncapacity of state PWDs to manage their road assets. \n  \n9.  Lessons from the past and ongoing state road projects in India have been reflected in \nthe design of the investment program. The design of individual road improvement subprojects is \nkept simple using a small number of large civil works contracts, which are to be supervised by \nconsultants.  To  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies,  a  series  of  technical \nassistance, both for project preparation and capacity building, have been provided.7 These have \nallowed PWD staff to be exposed to best practices in project preparation, and road asset \nmanagement.  The  large-size  contracts  are  expected  to  attract  qualified  and  experienced \ncontractors from outside NER. This will in turn help PWD staff gain exposure to modern project \nmanagement practices.  \n \n10.  The sector assessment provides more details on the road subsector in NER. 8   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be improved surface-transport connectivity in NER, which is expected to \ncontribute  to  NER\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Improved  surface-transport \nconnectivity  will  facilitate  delivery  of  various  development  schemes  in  other  sectors.  The \noutcome will be improved mobility and accessibility in the project areas in NER that will be \nmeasured in terms of traffic growth rates, cost of transport and travel time. The investment \n                                                 \n5  The Border Roads Organization and the National Highways Authority of India.  \n6  Approved in June 2006, and being implemented in two phases. Phase A of SARDP-NE is to improve about 4,100 \nkm of national and state roads, of which 440 km roads have been completed by 2010. \n7  In addition to the project preparatory technical assistance (footnote 2), the ADB provided capacity building technical \nassistance.

Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs include (i) about 430 km of priority state road sections in six states in NER \nreconstructed  or  upgraded;  and  (ii)  business  process  and  staff  skills  of  the  state  PWDs \nimproved through the provision of institutional development and capacity building support in \nplanning and project management, road asset management, road safety, and operation and \nmaintenance financing. \n \nD.    Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The investment program is estimated to cost $ 298.2 million equivalent inclusive of civil \nworks, consulting services, equipment, incremental costs, land acquisition and resettlement, \ntaxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction (Table 1).  \n \n14.  The government has requested an MFF of up to $200 million from the ordinary capital \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance a part of the investment \nprogram. The MFF is considered to be an appropriate modality for financing this investment \nprogram as it allows phased implementation of individual subprojects by the six project states \nwith different levels of project management capacity and exposure to large scale infrastructure \ndevelopment. The MFF will consist of two tranches, subject to the government's submission of \nrelated periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for \neach tranche, and fulfillment of terms, conditions, and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement.9  \n \nTable 1: Investment Program Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta\nA.

The loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, consulting services, and \nother capacity building support. All of the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations \n                                                 \n9  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "4       \n \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans10 will apply to each \nloan, subject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any loan agreement. The \ngovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime \nfor each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related periodic financing \nrequest with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. \nThe government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n16.  The first tranche of the MFF, for which a periodic financing request has been submitted, \nwill be $74.8 million, and have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.  \n \n17.  The first tranche will finance civil works to improve 202 km state roads in three states, \nand consulting services for project management and construction supervision. The subprojects \nselected for the first tranche have generally higher readiness in terms of land acquisition, \nenvironmental clearance and consultant recruitment. It is expected that the rest of the civil \nworks for 230 km road improvement and the related supervision consulting services will be \nfinanced in the second tranche.  \n \n18.  The government will provide the proceeds of the loans under the MFF in local currency \nto MDONER and through MDONER to the state governments on a grant basis. The government \nwill bear the foreign exchange risk on the loans.

In addition to the attached capacity building TA, capacity building TA will be provided in \nparallel to assist the PWDs in implementing road asset management systems and in road \nsafety.13 ADB\u2019s assistance to the state PWDs for preconstruction activities will continue under \nthe ongoing project preparatory TA14 and sector-wide capacity development TA15 to areas \nrequiring specific attention such as procurement, financial management, social safeguards, and \nenvironmental impact management.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n24.  The improvement works will be carried out in accordance with the engineering design \ndeveloped based on site condition surveys and field investigation. The engineering design has \noptimized the extent of physical alteration to the existing terrain so that minimal land will need to \nbe acquired and disturbances to the existing slopes will be limited while meeting the projected \ntraffic demand. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The  approach  used  to  evaluate  the  proposed  investment  program  follows  standard \npractice of comparing life-cycle road agency and user costs with and without the investment, \nusing net present value with a 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as \ndecision criteria. The Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4) is used as the \nbasis for the analysis. The analysis focuses on savings in transport costs. Value added from \nbetter transport links resulting in new industries and employment are not quantified in this \nanalysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic.  \n \n26.  The EIRR for the roads evaluated varies from 15% to 31%. Options such as reducing \nthe formation width were considered for the roads in hilly terrain where costs were higher than \nanticipated at the detailed design stage. \n \n27.  The following sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs increase by \n20%; (ii) base benefits decrease by 20%; (iii) reduced traffic growth rate by 50%; (iv) no traffic is \ngenerated; and (v) a combination of (i) and (ii). The results show that the quantified economic \nbenefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. The EIRR falls below 12% for three roads \nproposed for the second tranche for cases where growth rate reduction, no generated traffic, or \nthe combination of benefit reduction and cost increase occurs (cases iii-v). Although the EIRR is \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2009.

Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. The funds flow from MDONER to the state governments will \nfollow the pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the Government of \nIndia, and its relevant financial rules will apply. This includes requirements such as providing \naudited utilization certificates for each fund release from MDONER to the state governments. In \naddition, to ensure timely release of the central grant, and exclusive state use for the purpose of \nthe investment program, MDONER will require that the central grant be kept in a separate bank \naccount in each state for ready access by the project implementation unit. For disbursement of \nloan proceeds under the facility, reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \n29.  Procurement.  Civil  works  are  packaged  into  large  contracts  to  attract  qualified \ncontractors  and  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nConstruction supervision consultants will help the project implementation units with contract \nadministration. The project management consultant will help MDONER with overall project \nmanagement. For procurement of civil works and recruitment of consultants, MDONER and the \nstate governments will be required to submit for ADB's prior approval draft documents and \nreports  related  to  civil  works  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment,  as  required  by  the \nrelevant ADB guidelines.  \n \n30.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Government of India and the state governments. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual \n(footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  NER states are among the poorest states in the country in terms of per capita income, \neconomic growth, and human and social development indicators. The Planning Commission \nestimates that more than 30% (13.2 million) of NER\u2019s population live below the poverty line. An \nestimated 4.8 million live adjacent (within 10 km) to the project roads. Of these, an estimated \n1.6 million living below the poverty line will be among the direct beneficiaries. \n \n32.  Improved  roads  will  result  in  shorter  travel  distances  and  travel  times,  and  lower \ntransportation costs. This will in turn enable reliable access to social services, particularly health \ncare and educational facilities. Other positive outcomes will be increased social, educational, \nand health status of women and children; and improved preconditions for safe motherhood. The \ninvestment program will improve links between village communities and urban centers, and will \nprovide opportunities for employment and wider marketing of agricultural and other indigenous \nproducts. Reliable and efficient transportation will reduce wastage, particularly of agricultural \nproduce and perishables.17 \n \n1.  Gender  \n \n33.  Women in the northeastern states are largely involved in household work, cultivation, \nand  other  farming  activities.  Traditional  gender  division  of  labor  can  be  challenged  by \n                                                 \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8       \n \nproactively ensuring women\u2019s involvement in road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance \nin a culturally sensitive manner. The investment program will generate an estimated 3 million \nperson-days  of  employment.  Areas  identified  for  potential  involvement  of  women  include \nsupport  services  to  construction  camps  and  bioengineering.18  In  this  respect,  the  project \nimplementation units will encourage civil works contractors to (i) engage women workers as \nwage laborers depending on their skills, (ii) assign bioengineering works for road rehabilitation \nand maintenance to women to the extent possible, and (iii) ensure equal wages for equal work \nbetween men and women. The construction supervision consultant will monitor the civil works \ncontractors. The investment program will also provide benefits to women in terms of reduced \ntravel times, lower fares and charges, and easier access to various social services. \n \n2.  HIV/AIDS \n \n34.  The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare estimates that there are 53,112 HIV infections in the seven states of NER in 2009.  \nManipur, with a population of 2.1 million and an estimated 26,773 cases, has the highest \nconcentration of HIV infections in the northeast region, followed by Assam with an estimated \n14,244 cases. Manipur is close to Myanmar and the Golden Triangle and is a major transit route \nfor drug smuggling and usage. National statistics show that while injecting drug users and men \nhaving sex with men are the most vulnerable groups to HIV infections, an alarming trend in the \nnortheast region is the growing number of HIV infections among female sex workers. \n \n35.  The State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (SACS) of each state is tasked to \nimplement the programs of the NACO at the local level. Specifically, the SACS are mandated to \nprovide  medical  and  health  services,  public  awareness  raising  projects  and  social  sector \nservices, and monitoring. Following the Third National AIDS Control Project (NACP-III),19 the \ngovernment has set up the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit to provide more targeted \ninterventions to high risk groups and an integrated and augmented system of prevention, care \nand  support,  and  treatment  at  the  district  level.  Based  on  existing initiatives,  and  through \niterative discussions with NACO, ADB is convinced that mitigating measures are in place to \naddress all health and social risks and impacts associated with infrastructure development in \nthe project area. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  1.  Involuntary Resettlement   \n \n36.  The investment program was developed with a view to minimize the need for land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement. Where possible, construction activities will take place \nwithin the existing rights-of-way. Resettlement plans were prepared for the four roads in project \n1 to address land acquisition and resettlement impacts.20 A total of 1,453 households will be \naffected, out of which 275 will have a partial impact on their commercial structures, 802 will lose \na portion of their residential structure, and 119 will have a partial impact on their residential-\ncommercial structures; the rest would either lose a strip of agricultural land or open land. The \ndisplaced households will be entitled to compensation for the loss of land and structures at \n                                                 \n18 Bioengineering is the use of vegetation and terracing, and the construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize \nroad embankments and slopes. Bioengineering also includes tree planting with deep-rooted species, which will \nreduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. \n19 Government of India, National AIDS Control Organization. 2006.

Resettlement  for \nproject 1 is estimated to cost about $4 million. In accordance with a resettlement framework21  \nprepared for the investment program, each state will prepare a resettlement plan for each \nsubproject in subsequent tranches and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \n2.  Indigenous Peoples   \n \n37.  In NER, the scheduled tribe population constitutes 27% of the total population. More \nthan 100 tribal groups reside in NER. In Meghalaya and Mizoram, the majority of the population \nis tribal, while in the remaining states the tribal population is not distinctive in the sense that they \nare  inherently  integrated  with  the  dominant  population  of  the  state.  Tribal  groups  in  the \nsubproject areas freely interact with the outside community. These groups have nuclear families \nand  are  open  to  new  ideas  like  family  planning  and  formal  education.  Social  impact \nassessments  confirm  that  the  socioeconomic  impacts  due  to  the  subprojects  will  not  be \ncomparatively different for these people when compared with the remainder of the population. \nCombined  indigenous  peoples  plans  and  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  road \nimprovement under project 1. Adequate compensation provisions are made to mitigate adverse \nimpacts on indigenous peoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework22 was prepared for \nthe investment program and for subsequent tranches. In accordance with the framework, if any \nsignificant  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  in  the  subprojects  in  subsequent \ntranches, the relevant state will prepare an indigenous peoples plan and submit it to ADB for \napproval. \n \n3.  Environmental Impacts   \n \n38.  Project 1 is classified as environmental category B. Initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) were prepared to address the impacts.23 Although the project roads pass through reserve \nforest, vegetation density along the project roads is moderate and not endangered. Therefore, \nthe IEEs indicate no major adverse environmental impacts. However, the IEEs will be updated \nbased  on  detailed  design  and  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works;  the  environmental \nmanagement plans will be included in the civil works contract. The investment program involves \nimprovement  and  reconstruction  of  existing  state  highways  and  district  roads  on  existing \nalignments and within available rights-of-way, with minor land acquisition.  \n \n39.  The  IEEs  find  that  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  upgrading  and \nimprovement of the project roads will occur mainly during construction. However, since most of \nthe roads are located in hilly areas, landslides could occur during construction and operation. \nThe other important issue related to construction is the disposal of spoil materials from earth \nwork. Contractors will need to be monitored to ensure that spoil materials are not disposed of in \nforested areas, nearby water bodies, agriculture land, and on the down-slope side of roads \nwithout  adequate  protection.  These  impacts  are  manageable  and  can  be  mitigated  by \nimplementing the mitigation measures recommended in the IEEs. The IEEs confirm that none of \nthe  project  roads  are  located  in  environmentally  and  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework24 was prepared for the investment program \nand subsequent tranches. \n \n                                                 \n21  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n24 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "10       \n \nF.

ASSURANCES \n \n41.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  state  governments  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the investment program will conform to all applicable ADB policies including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  facility  administration  manual \n(footnote 11) and loan documents. \n \n42.
