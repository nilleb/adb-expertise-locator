The \nimproved  secondary  road  network  will  provide  important  linkage  between  the  primary  and \ntertiary  road  networks  in  the  region,  for  which  there  are  ongoing  national  programs  for \nimprovement.      \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNER  forms  a  distinct  geographical  unit,  representing  about  8%  of  the  country\u2019s \ngeographic area. It has a population of about 39 million (about 4% of the country\u2019s population).3 \nApproximately  98%  of  NER's  borders  are  with  other  countries\u2014Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  the \nPeople's Republic of China, Myanmar, and Nepal. Its connection with the rest of the country is \nonly  through  a  narrow  land  corridor.  Except  in  Assam,  NER  has  predominantly  hilly  to \nmountainous  terrain  and  very  high  rainfall  (among  the  highest  in  the  world),  which  frequently \nresults in landslides and floods.  \n \n4. \nRecognizing  the  need  for  accelerated  development,  the  Government  of  India  places \nspecial focus on the development of NER in its five-year plans, mainly through central funding of \ndevelopment  activities  in  the  region.  Over  the  last  two  decades  the  government  has  required \n10% of the budgets of central ministries and departments to be allocated for NER, and created \na  funding  mechanism  for  pooling  the  unspent  allocated  central  funds  for  further  assistance  to \nthe region. However, the recent growth performance of these states has not been encouraging.  \nThe  government\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012  states  that  \u201cwhile  development  efforts \nover  the  years  have  made  some  impact  (as  reflected  in  some  of  the  human  development \nindicators,  which  are  comparable  with  the  rest  of  the  country),  the  region  is  deficit  in  physical \ninfrastructure which has a multiplier effect on economic development.\"4 \n \n5. \nThe  government  created  a  dedicated  ministry\u2014MDONER\u2014to  coordinate  and  give \nimpetus  to  the  various  central  development  efforts.  MDONER  responsibilities  include  dealing \nwith  matters  relating  to  the  planning,  execution,  and  monitoring  of  development  schemes  and \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

New Delhi. \n\n\f2       \n \n\nprojects in the region including those for roads and administering the non-lapsable central pool \nof resources.   \n \n6. \nWith  the  limited  exception  of  the  highest  class  roads  (mostly  national  highways \nmaintained  by  central  organizations5),  the  NER  road  network  needs  substantial  improvement, \nthrough its expansion and improvement of individual road sections. The latter will be by way of \nwidening  the  existing  roadway,  strengthening  pavements,  improving  road  geometry,  raising \nembankments, and providing permanent structures at river-crossings. The capacity of the state \nPWDs, which maintain the secondary road network, needs substantial strengthening, and their \nstaff needs exposure to modern project management and asset management practices, which \nis currently lacking due to limited private sector involvement in road infrastructure development.  \n \nWith renewed recognition that inadequate roads and bridges supporting road transport, \n7. \nthe  region\u2019s  single  most  dominant  transport  mode,  are  the  major  constraints  on  development \nefforts,  the  government  started  a  national  investment  program  to  improve  road  connectivity  to \nremote places in the region. The Special Accelerated Road Development Program in the North \nEastern Region (SARDP-NE) is to improve higher class roads including national highways and \nstate roads in the region, and provide connectivity to the state capitals and district headquarters \nin NER by developing two-lane national highways and improving state roads.6  \n \nThe  present  investment  program  was  developed  in  parallel  with  SARDP-NE  and  is \n8. \ncomplementary to it. While SARDP-NE focuses on improving higher class roads, the investment \nprogram  is  developed  to  improve  intrastate  connectivity,  mainly  to  district  headquarters  and \nother places of administrative and economic importance in the individual states, and to enhance \ncapacity of state PWDs to manage their road assets. \n  \n9. \nLessons  from  the  past  and  ongoing  state  road  projects  in  India  have  been  reflected  in \nthe design of the investment program. The design of individual road improvement subprojects is \nkept simple using a small number of large civil works contracts, which are to be supervised by \nconsultants.  To  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies,  a  series  of  technical \nassistance, both for project preparation and capacity building, have been provided.7 These have \nallowed  PWD  staff  to  be  exposed  to  best  practices  in  project  preparation,  and  road  asset \nmanagement.  The  large-size  contracts  are  expected  to  attract  qualified  and  experienced \ncontractors from outside NER. This will in turn help PWD staff gain exposure to modern project \nmanagement practices.  \n \n10. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe impact will be improved surface-transport connectivity in NER, which is expected to \ncontribute  to  NER\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Improved  surface-transport \nconnectivity  will  facilitate  delivery  of  various  development  schemes  in  other  sectors.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  mobility  and  accessibility  in  the  project  areas  in  NER  that  will  be \nmeasured  in  terms  of  traffic  growth  rates,  cost  of  transport  and  travel  time.  The  investment \n\nThe sector assessment provides more details on the road subsector in NER. 8   \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n5   The Border Roads Organization and the National Highways Authority of India.  \n6  Approved in June 2006, and being implemented in two phases. Phase A of SARDP-NE is to improve about 4,100 \n\nkm of national and state roads, of which 440 km roads have been completed by 2010. \n\n7  In addition to the project preparatory technical assistance (footnote 2), the ADB provided capacity building technical \nassistance.

The  MFF  is  considered  to  be  an  appropriate  modality  for  financing  this  investment \nprogram  as  it  allows  phased  implementation  of  individual subprojects  by  the  six  project  states \nwith different levels of project management capacity and exposure to large scale infrastructure \ndevelopment. The MFF will consist of two tranches, subject to the government's submission of \nrelated  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements  for \neach tranche, and fulfillment of terms, conditions, and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement.9  \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nInvestment componentc\n\nBase Costb\n1. \n2.

The \ngovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime \nfor  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  of  each  loan  will  be  based  on  the  related  periodic  financing \nrequest with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. \nThe government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n16. \nThe first tranche of the MFF, for which a periodic financing request has been submitted, \nwill  be  $74.8  million,  and  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  5 years,  an  annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.  \n \nThe first tranche will finance civil works to improve 202 km state roads in three states, \n17. \nand consulting services for project management and construction supervision.

The engineering design has \noptimized the extent of physical alteration to the existing terrain so that minimal land will need to \nbe acquired and disturbances to the existing slopes will be limited while meeting the projected \ntraffic demand. \n \nB. \n \nThe  approach  used  to  evaluate  the  proposed  investment  program  follows  standard \n25. \npractice  of  comparing  life-cycle  road  agency  and  user  costs  with  and  without  the  investment, \nusing net present value with a 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as \ndecision  criteria.  The  Highway  Development  and  Management  Model  (HDM-4)  is  used  as  the \nbasis  for  the  analysis.  The  analysis  focuses  on  savings  in  transport  costs.  Value  added  from \nbetter  transport  links  resulting  in  new  industries  and  employment  are  not  quantified  in  this \nanalysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic.  \n \nThe  EIRR  for  the  roads  evaluated  varies  from  15%  to  31%.  Options  such  as  reducing \n26. \nthe formation width were considered for the roads in hilly terrain where costs were higher than \nanticipated at the detailed design stage. \n \nThe  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  construction  costs  increase  by \n27. \n20%; (ii) base benefits decrease by 20%; (iii) reduced traffic growth rate by 50%; (iv) no traffic is \ngenerated; and (v) a combination of (i) and (ii). The results show that the quantified economic \nbenefits  are  robust  to  various  sensitivity  tests.  The  EIRR  falls  below  12%  for  three  roads \nproposed for the second tranche for cases where growth rate reduction, no generated traffic, or \nthe combination of benefit reduction and cost increase occurs (cases iii-v). Although the EIRR is \n                                                 \n13    ADB.  2009.

The  funds  flow  from  MDONER  to  the  state  governments  will \nfollow the pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the Government of \nIndia,  and  its  relevant  financial  rules  will  apply.  This  includes  requirements  such  as  providing \naudited utilization certificates for each fund release from MDONER to the state governments. In \naddition, to ensure timely release of the central grant, and exclusive state use for the purpose of \nthe investment program, MDONER will require that the central grant be kept in a separate bank \naccount in each state for ready access by the project implementation unit. For disbursement of \nloan proceeds under the facility, reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \nProcurement.  Civil  works  are  packaged  into  large  contracts  to  attract  qualified \n29. \ncontractors  and  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nConstruction  supervision  consultants  will  help  the  project  implementation  units  with  contract \nadministration.  The  project  management  consultant  will  help  MDONER  with  overall  project \nmanagement. For procurement of civil works and recruitment of consultants, MDONER and the \nstate  governments  will  be  required  to  submit  for  ADB's  prior  approval  draft  documents  and \nreports  related  to  civil  works  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment,  as  required  by  the \nrelevant ADB guidelines.  \n \n30. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Government of India and the state governments. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual \n(footnote 11). \n \nD. \n \n31. \nNER states are among the poorest states in the country in terms of per capita income, \neconomic  growth,  and  human  and  social  development  indicators.  The  Planning  Commission \nestimates that more than 30% (13.2 million) of NER\u2019s population live below the poverty line. An \nestimated  4.8  million  live  adjacent  (within  10  km)  to  the  project  roads.  Of  these,  an  estimated \n1.6 million living below the poverty line will be among the direct beneficiaries. \n \nImproved  roads  will  result  in  shorter  travel  distances  and  travel  times,  and  lower \n32. \ntransportation costs. This will in turn enable reliable access to social services, particularly health \ncare  and  educational  facilities.  Other  positive  outcomes  will  be  increased  social,  educational, \nand health status of women and children; and improved preconditions for safe motherhood. The \ninvestment program will improve links between village communities and urban centers, and will \nprovide opportunities for employment and wider marketing of agricultural and other indigenous \nproducts.  Reliable  and  efficient  transportation  will  reduce  wastage,  particularly  of  agricultural \nproduce and perishables.17 \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n1. \n\nGender  \n\n \n33.  Women  in  the  northeastern  states  are  largely  involved  in  household  work,  cultivation, \nand  other  farming  activities.  Traditional  gender  division  of  labor  can  be  challenged  by \n \n                                                \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8       \n \n\nproactively ensuring women\u2019s involvement in road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance \nin  a  culturally  sensitive  manner.  The  investment  program  will  generate  an  estimated  3  million \nperson-days  of  employment.  Areas  identified  for  potential  involvement  of  women  include \nsupport  services  to  construction  camps  and  bioengineering. 18   In  this  respect,  the  project \nimplementation  units  will  encourage  civil  works  contractors  to  (i)  engage  women  workers  as \nwage laborers depending on their skills, (ii) assign bioengineering works for road rehabilitation \nand maintenance to women to the extent possible, and (iii) ensure equal wages for equal work \nbetween men and women. The construction supervision consultant will monitor the civil works \ncontractors.  The  investment  program  will  also  provide  benefits  to  women  in  terms  of  reduced \ntravel times, lower fares and charges, and easier access to various social services. \n \n\n2. \n\nHIV/AIDS \n\n \n34. \nThe  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  (NACO)  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family \nWelfare  estimates  that  there  are  53,112  HIV  infections  in  the  seven  states  of  NER  in  2009.  \nManipur,  with  a  population  of  2.1  million  and  an  estimated  26,773  cases,  has  the  highest \nconcentration  of  HIV  infections  in  the  northeast  region,  followed  by  Assam  with  an  estimated \n14,244 cases. Manipur is close to Myanmar and the Golden Triangle and is a major transit route \nfor drug smuggling and usage. National statistics show that while injecting drug users and men \nhaving sex with men are the most vulnerable groups to HIV infections, an alarming trend in the \nnortheast region is the growing number of HIV infections among female sex workers. \n \n35. \nThe  State  AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  Society  (SACS)  of  each  state  is  tasked  to \nimplement the programs of the NACO at the local level. Specifically, the SACS are mandated to \nprovide  medical  and  health  services,  public  awareness  raising  projects  and  social  sector \nservices,  and  monitoring.  Following  the  Third  National  AIDS  Control  Project  (NACP-III),19  the \ngovernment has set up the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit to provide more targeted \ninterventions to high risk groups and an integrated and augmented system of prevention, care \nand  support,  and  treatment  at  the  district  level.  Based  on  existing  initiatives,  and  through \niterative  discussions  with  NACO,  ADB  is  convinced  that  mitigating  measures  are  in  place  to \naddress  all  health  and  social  risks  and  impacts  associated  with  infrastructure  development  in \nthe project area. \n \nE. \n \n \n \n36. \nThe  investment  program  was  developed  with  a  view  to  minimize  the  need  for  land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement. Where possible, construction activities will take place \nwithin the existing rights-of-way. Resettlement plans were prepared for the four roads in project \n1  to  address  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.20  A  total  of  1,453  households  will  be \naffected, out of which 275 will have a partial impact on their commercial structures, 802 will lose \na  portion  of  their  residential  structure,  and  119  will  have  a  partial  impact  on  their  residential-\ncommercial  structures;  the  rest  would  either  lose  a  strip  of agricultural  land  or  open  land.  The \ndisplaced  households  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  the  loss  of  land  and  structures  at \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement   \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n18 Bioengineering is the use of vegetation and terracing, and the construction of efficient drainage systems to stabilize \nroad  embankments  and  slopes.  Bioengineering  also  includes  tree  planting  with  deep-rooted  species,  which  will \nreduce the risk of shallow slides and debris flow. \n\n19 Government of India, National AIDS Control Organization. 2006.

Resettlement  for \nproject 1 is estimated to cost about $4 million. In accordance with a resettlement framework21  \nprepared  for  the  investment  program,  each  state  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  for  each \nsubproject in subsequent tranches and submit it to ADB for approval. \n \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous Peoples   \n\n \n37. \nIn  NER,  the  scheduled  tribe  population  constitutes  27%  of  the  total  population.  More \nthan 100 tribal groups reside in NER. In Meghalaya and Mizoram, the majority of the population \nis tribal, while in the remaining states the tribal population is not distinctive in the sense that they \nare  inherently  integrated  with  the  dominant  population  of  the  state.  Tribal  groups  in  the \nsubproject areas freely interact with the outside community. These groups have nuclear families \nand  are  open  to  new  ideas  like  family  planning  and  formal  education.  Social  impact \nassessments  confirm  that  the  socioeconomic  impacts  due  to  the  subprojects  will  not  be \ncomparatively different for these people when compared with the remainder of the population. \nCombined  indigenous  peoples  plans  and  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  road \nimprovement under project 1. Adequate compensation provisions are made to mitigate adverse \nimpacts on indigenous peoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework22 was prepared for \nthe investment program and for subsequent tranches. In accordance with the framework, if any \nsignificant  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  in  the  subprojects  in  subsequent \ntranches,  the  relevant  state  will  prepare  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for \napproval. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts   \n\nThe \n\n \n38. \nProject  1  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEEs) were prepared to address the impacts.23 Although the project roads pass through reserve \nforest, vegetation density along the project roads is moderate and not endangered. Therefore, \nthe IEEs indicate no major adverse environmental impacts. However, the IEEs will be updated \nbased  on  detailed  design  and  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works;  the  environmental \nmanagement plans will be included in the civil works contract. The investment program involves \nimprovement  and  reconstruction  of  existing  state  highways  and  district  roads  on  existing \nalignments and within available rights-of-way, with minor land acquisition.  \n \n39. \nthe  upgrading  and \nimprovement of the project roads will occur mainly during construction. However, since most of \nthe  roads  are  located  in  hilly  areas,  landslides  could  occur  during  construction  and  operation. \nThe  other  important  issue  related  to  construction  is  the  disposal  of  spoil  materials  from  earth \nwork. Contractors will need to be monitored to ensure that spoil materials are not disposed of in \nforested  areas,  nearby  water  bodies,  agriculture  land,  and  on  the  down-slope  side  of  roads \nwithout  adequate  protection.  These  impacts  are  manageable  and  can  be  mitigated  by \nimplementing the mitigation measures recommended in the IEEs. The IEEs confirm that none of \nthe  project  roads  are  located  in  environmentally  and  ecologically  sensitive  areas.
