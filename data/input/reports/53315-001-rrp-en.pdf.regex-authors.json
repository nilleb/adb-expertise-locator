THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \n(i) policy-based grant and (ii) a project grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Power \nSector Development Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA)\u2014\nPreparing and Implementing Gender-Inclusive Projects in Central and West Asia, Subproject 4: \nEmpowering Women in the Power Sector in Tajikistan\u2014and if the Board approves the proposed \ngrants, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program will intensify the implementation of ongoing reforms and improve \nthe financial sustainability of the power subsector in Tajikistan.1 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  has  supported  Tajikistan\u2019s  power  subsector  reforms  since  2012  through  the  sector \noperational performance improvement (SOPI) program, a component of the Regional Power \nTransmission Project.2 The SOPI program built the basis for the proposed fundamental reforms, \nwhich  include  unbundling  the  vertically  integrated  power  utility,  restructuring  its  excessive \nliabilities, establishing a regulator, adopting a tariff methodology, and setting up a new centralized \ncash control system among the unbundled entities. As a part of the reforms and institutional \ncapacity building, a newly established power distribution company will be operated under a 5-year \nmanagement contract. Investments in retail advanced metering infrastructure in Dushanbe, the \nnation's capital, and six other cities will fill the key deficiencies in the subsector\u2019s power loss \naccounting and bill collection systems.3  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Tajikistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged \n7.1% during 2016\u20132019. The fiscal deficit spiked in 2017 to 6.0% of GDP as the government \nincreased borrowing to recapitalize state-owned banks left insolvent by the 2015 financial crisis \nand to boost capital expenditures for the Rogun hydropower project.4 As the Rogun expenditures \nbecame more contained, the government brought the fiscal deficit under control, to 2.8% of GDP \nin 2018 and 2.1% in 2019. Before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the fiscal deficit \nwas projected to rise to 5.2% of GDP in 2020 and stabilize at 4% on average in 2021\u20132022. Public \ndebt was on a downward trend from a peak of 50.4% of GDP in 2017 to 44.6% in 2019. The \ncurrent account deficit also narrowed from 5.0% of GDP in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019. The government \nhas been implementing (i) public financial management reforms, supported by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, to improve fiscal management; and (ii) reforms to state-owned enterprises \nin the power subsector to improve their performance and corporate governance, and reduce \nlosses and fiscal risks. While Tajikistan had been categorized as being at high risk of debt distress \nby the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2017, the IMF\u2019s analysis in 2020 concluded that \nthe  country\u2019s  public  debt  is  sustainable.  ADB  also  assessed  that  Tajikistan's  overall \nmacroeconomic management is generally sound.5 \n \n \n1  The program is included as the Power Sector Development Project in ADB. 2019.

Tajikistan: Regional Power Transmission Project. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance for Preparing Sustainable Energy Projects in Central Asia. Manila. \n4  The Rogun hydropower plant is a government-led special purpose company, separate from Barqi Tojik. The planned \ncapacity is 3,600 megawatts (MW) for an estimated cost of $4.9 billion (exceeding 50% of GDP). Construction \naccelerated as relations with Uzbekistan improved in 2018. The government views the plant as critical to resolving \nTajikistan\u2019s winter power deficit and to its role as a regional energy supplier in the future. The launch of the first two \nunits in 2018 and 2019 helped boost Tajikistan\u2019s electricity exports to Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. \n5  ADB. 2020. Tajikistan: COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program. Manila. \n ", "2 \n4.  Impact of COVID-19 in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant \nsocioeconomic shock in Tajikistan. ADB forecasts that GDP will contract by 0.5% in 2020.6 The \nIMF also forecasts a recession with a GDP growth rate of 1%. Revenue shortfalls equivalent to \n2.2% of GDP will expand the fiscal deficit to 6.0% of GDP, and the currency was devalued by \n6.4%. The key transmission mechanisms are a sharp reduction in remittances, international trade, \nand foreign direct investment; and slowdowns in the transport, tourism, retail, and finance \nindustries. The health sector is not well equipped to respond to a large-scale health crisis, and \nunemployment and poverty are expected to rise. The power subsector as one of the backbones \nof the economy is also negatively impacted by these economic challenges, especially by reduced \ndemand and lower bill collection rates. Improving the subsector\u2019s performance by tackling key \nissues (paras. 5\u201310) has become more important to avoid further constraint on the country\u2019s \nmacroeconomy and reduce the economic loss.  \n \n5.  Power subsector\u2019s debt crisis. Joint Stock Holding Company Barqi Tojik has run \nTajikistan\u2019s power subsector since 1999. In 2019, it had 6,473 megawatts (MW) of installed \ngeneration capacity, of which 5,758 MW was hydro and 715 MW was thermal. Tajikistan\u2019s \nelectricity system was part of the Central Asian Power System, a regional network connecting \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In 2009, after a \nregional blackout, the Tajik system was disconnected from the Central Asian Power System. \nForced to run independently despite its dependence on the regional connections, Barqi Tojik \nurgently needed to invest in its infrastructure, especially in generation and transmission. Grants \nand loans from development partners such as ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (EBRD), the World Bank, and bilateral official agencies were mobilized to support \nthis effort. By 2018, Barqi Tojik had built a unified national grid with an international standard \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system, and largely overcame its winter power shortage. \n \n6.  The rapid investments, however, led to a sharp increase in Barqi Tojik\u2019s liabilities as the \ngovernment re-lent all grants and loans from development partners with a premium of 1%\u20138%. \nFaced with a serious cash shortage, Barqi Tojik also kept incurring liabilities as payables to \nindependent  power  producers  and  from  commercial  borrowing.  Its  total  liabilities  stood  at \n$2.7 billion by the end of 2018, of which $1.3 billion was re-lent debt from the government and \n$0.2 billion was a commercial loan, all in foreign exchange. The depreciation of the somoni by \nabout 46% between 2014 and 2018 increased the impact of these liabilities and the associated \ninterest payments on Barqi Tojik.   \n \n7.  Moreover, Tajikistan\u2019s economy remains vulnerable given its close correlation with the \nbusiness cycles of key trading partners, low savings, and large needs for job creation. To ensure \nthe population\u2019s access to electricity in the challenging economic environment, the government \nhas kept power prices low with limited increases (para. 8). Yet the government lacks resources \nto  fill  the  gap  between  costs  and  end-user  prices,  borne  by  Barqi  Tojik.  This  problem  is \nexacerbated by low collections from customers. The combination of constrained revenues and \nmounting liabilities has led to Barqi Tojik\u2019s negative equity status since 2015. \n \n8.  Weak regulations and inadequate tariffs. In response to the financial issues of Barqi \nTojik, the government increased end-user electricity tariffs by 15% on average each year during \n2014\u20132019. However, Tajikistan\u2019s electricity tariffs are still some of the lowest in the world and do \nnot cover the costs. Further, without a sector regulator or a tariff methodology, Barqi Tojik has not \nbeen required or incentivized to reveal the true cost of electricity supply. For example, its system \n \n6  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update. Manila. \n ", "3 \nlosses are only indicative and not based on measured data. These factors have led to large losses \nwith unidentified sources for Barqi Tojik. \n \n9.  Structural corporate governance issues. The government attempted to improve Barqi \nTojik\u2019s operations through more effective corporate governance by replacing the company\u2019s \nchairpersons. However, this has not improved corporate governance or performance, and the \ngovernment set up two supervisory boards, which have managed Barqi Tojik since 2011\u2014(i) the \nbudget management supervisory board, led by the prime minister, approves Barqi Tojik\u2019s monthly \nbudgets; and (ii) the reform supervisory board, led by the first deputy prime minister, oversees \nthe unbundling process. While some progress was made, Barqi Tojik needs to have an adequate \nmanagement structure of its own to achieve financial sustainability. Advisory consulting support \nfrom development partners also had a limited impact on corporate governance. Furthermore, with \ninvestment needs estimated at $6.0 billion to improve the obsolete infrastructure system,7 public \nfinancing will not be enough, and the power subsector needs much wider private participation. To \nachieve this, it has to shift from government-led operations to a more market-based structure. The \nSOPI program produced a road map in 2016 for the development of an electricity trading market \nwith unbundled utilities. Based on this road map, the government in April 2018 issued a decree \nto establish the joint stock companies Electric Transmission Network and Electric Distribution \nNetwork (EDN)8 and keep the generation function at Barqi Tojik. However, to avoid supply \ninterruption, Barqi Tojik has stayed in control of sector operations, and the two new companies \nwere not operationalized as independent companies. In addition, the lack of female employment \nremains a serious challenge\u2014women account for only 12% of the 11,074 employees of Barqi \nTojik, and hold only 11% of managerial positions.   \n \n10.  Inadequate metering system. Accurately tracking power flows is key to performance \nmonitoring, and it requires adequate metering both at the wholesale and retail levels. Barqi Tojik \nand feasibility study consultants estimated the transmission and distribution system losses at 22% \nand the collection rate at 86% in 2017. However, in most parts of Tajikistan, the customer \ndatabase is incomplete; the number of meters is insufficient; and meters are 30\u201340 years old, \ninaccurate, and manually read, all of which makes such estimates unreliable. At the wholesale \nlevel, ADB is providing support to install a metering system by 2021.9 At the retail level, Barqi \nTojik, with EBRD financing, installed advanced metering infrastructure in the Sugd Region, home \nto Tajikistan's second largest city by population, Khujand, and improved collection from 80% in \n2015 to 100% in 2018. The government plans to roll out advanced retail metering to the whole \ncountry and started a pilot in one of the four districts in Dushanbe, but Barqi Tojik's fragile financial \nposition has constrained progress. \n \nB.  Program Description \n \n11.  The government\u2019s efforts to restore the financial sustainability of the power subsector \nincluded annual tariff increases, the revival of exports to Uzbekistan in 2018,10 and investments \nin metering and billing systems in Sugd. While these have had positive impacts, Barqi Tojik\u2019s \nfinancial condition continued to deteriorate, calling for more fundamental and comprehensive \nreforms.  Given  the  urgency  of  the  situation,  the  government  (i)  started  accelerating  the \nimplementation of reforms based on a market development report prepared by the SOPI program \nin 2016; (ii) requested ADB, the EBRD and the World Bank to support the reform actions; and \n \n7  Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. 2017.

Tajikistan: Reconnection \nto the Central Asian Power System Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \n(iii) prepared a joint reform program in 2019. The reform agenda was also coordinated with the \nIMF and included in their program discussions with the government. The reforms focus on five \noutput areas\u2014outputs 1 and 2 cover the main policy component, outputs 3 and 4 combine policy \nand project elements, and output 5 is the main project component.11 The policy component \nincludes the post-program partnership framework (PPPF) under which the government will further \ndeepen the reform impacts.  \n \n12.  Output  1:  Power  subsector  governance  structure  strengthened  (policy).  As the \nsubsector aims to develop a more commercialized structure based on the market development \nroad map, unbundling needs to be completed urgently. The segmentation of the subsector \noperations into three companies (para. 9) will lead to clearer responsibilities for losses and \ninefficiencies among them and facilitate the adoption of the cost-based tariff methodology (para. \n13). To accelerate this process, the government issued four decrees between January 2019 and \nNovember 2020 to (i) approve the charters of the new companies, (ii) establish each company\u2019s \nsupervisory board as a governing body, (iii) complete the transfer of assets to each company, and \n(iv) appoint the chairpersons to start the operations as separate companies. The unbundling into \nsmaller  companies  will  also  make  it  easier to conduct  a  gender  analysis  and  identify the \nimprovements needed in human resources development\u2014e.g., in recruitment, training, and \nemployee  welfare\u2014to  support  the  employment  and  promotion  of  women  in  technical  and \nmanagerial positions.   \n \n13.  The replacement of one vertically integrated power utility with multiple entities requires \nmore stringent sector regulations. In 2019, the government adopted a grid code for the first time \nas the subsector\u2019s system operation rules, established a regulator to strengthen the sector\u2019s \ngovernance structure, and adopted a cost-based tariff methodology. The regulator will initially be \nhoused in the Anti-monopoly Agency and focus on implementing the new tariff methodology.12 As \nthe regulator acquires more experience, it is planned for it to play an increasingly important role \nas an oversight and licensing body, providing a more predictable and consistent regulatory \nenvironment, especially as more private sector participation is introduced. Through the PPPF, the \nregulator and the unbundled companies will start the tariff determination process based on the \nnew methodology. This will also set the stage for the next step of market development, the \nformulation of commercial agreements between the unbundled companies in the PPPF.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Financial  management  of  power  utilities  improved  (policy).  Foreign \nexchange-denominated liabilities are among the key causes of financial distress of Barqi Tojik. \nAs of 2018, Barqi Tojik had total loans of about TJS14 billion ($1.5 billion), of which TJS12 billion \n($1.3 billion) originated from development partners\u2019 loans and grants. In the past, the government \nre-lent all ADB project grants to Barqi Tojik with a 5% premium, and these grants account for \nabout 16% of total loans. Reducing the dollar-denominated liabilities is vital for decreasing foreign \nexchange exposure, which wiped out about 80% of revenues since 2015, and for improving cash \nmanagement in the subsector. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Energy and \nWater Resources (MOEWR) coordinated on devising financial recovery measures since 2018, \nand the government converted more than $400 million of existing loans based on past ADB and \nWorld Bank project grants into Barqi Tojik equity in 2020. The remaining grant-based re-lending \nwill also be gradually converted into Barqi Tojik equity by 2025, which will be monitored through \n \n11 The program\u2019s policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n12 The weighted average end-user tariff in 2018 was about TJS0.16 per kilowatt-hour against the estimated cost-\nrecovery level of TJS0.39 per kilowatt-hour. Source: World Bank. 2020. Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed \nGrant to the Republic of Tajikistan for a Power Utility Financial Recovery Program for Results. Washington, DC. \n ", "5 \nthis program\u2019s sector reform support (output 4) and an ongoing World Bank program.13 The re-\nlending arrangement was acceptable for past projects because Barqi Tojik is revenue-generating, \nbut the current financial challenges call for substantial government support. Barqi Tojik also \nnegotiated with the largest commercial creditor to restructure its debt at a lower interest rate to \nreduce the debt service burden.  \n \n15.  The reform program also redesigns the fund flow in the subsector. A government decree \nto establish a sector escrow account to collect all domestic power sale revenues is being finalized. \nAnother account for export revenues will be established before the ongoing Central Asia\u2013South \nAsia Electricity Transmission Project (CASA\u20131000), supported by various development partners, \nreaches  commissioning  in  2022.  Escrow  account  activities  will  be  managed  by  a  newly \nestablished market operator with a predetermined fund distribution formula. These accounts will \ncapture all cash inflows to the subsector to minimize human involvement and automate fund \ntransfers  to  ensure  on-time  priority  payments  and  sufficient  fund  distribution  among  the \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies. It will also guarantee timely payments \nunder restructured liabilities.14  \n \n16.  Completion of the policy action for the escrow account mechanism (policy action 5) was \ndelayed because the government functions were directly affected and slowed down by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic since May 2020. This pushed the preparation process into the period of the \npresidential election (October 2020), when government functions were further slowed down. \nTherefore, the government cannot complete this action before November 2020, nonetheless, the \ngovernment is prioritizing the action to complete it within 2020. In light of these extraordinary \nchallenges, the completion of this action has been included in the policy-based grant agreement \nas a condition for withdrawal. Once the government decree is executed, transactions based on \nthe escrow account will be monitored and reported through the PPPF.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Sustainable corporate management introduced in the new distribution \ncompany (policy and project). EDN will recruit a management contractor, an internationally \nreputable company with power utility operation experience, which will place five professional \nmanagers in EDN to operate it (unlike the advisory roles of consultants in the past) and improve \nits corporate governance. Acting on the recommendation of the SOPI road map in 2016, the \nMOEWR led extensive consultations within the government and with development partners on \nthe use of a management contract. In June 2018, 14 development partners jointly endorsed the \nreform strategy, including the use of a management contract.15 In September 2019, the ministry \nreceived the government\u2019s final approval to adopt the modality as part of the program\u2019s policy \ncomponent. The program\u2019s project component will finance the cost of the management contractor. \nThis will be one of the first public\u2013private partnership cases in the subsector and will be key to \nensuring the sustainability of the reforms and the new metering investment. The contractor will \nalso develop the capacity of local staff, including future managers of the company after the \ncontract is completed. Further, the contractor will be tasked to create a gender working group led \nby senior management and consisting of both male and female representatives of various job \nlevels and departments. This group will be responsible for incorporating gender in the strategic \ndirections and organizational functions of the company.  \n \n \n13 World Bank. 2020.

Washington, DC. \n14 Escrow accounts are a temporary measure to ensure that both cash and cash deficit is distributed among sector \nplayers until tariffs reach cost-recovery level and collections are close to 100% (targeted in 2025), after which a more \ncontract-based settlement with the market operator is envisioned.  \n15 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n18.  An enabling environment will be key to the success of the management contract. Given \nthe current lack of transparent data from Barqi Tojik, the contractor will be given the first year to \nassess  EDN\u2019s  infrastructure,  capacity,  and  regulatory  status  and  to  propose  operation \nimprovement plans with binding performance indicators. The indicators are linked with bonuses \nas  the  contractor\u2019s  incentives.  EDN\u2019s  supervisory  board  will  also  allow  for  adjustments  to \nconstraints beyond the contractor\u2019s control, such as the government-set tariffs. A list of strategic \nentities will be agreed among the government, the supervisory board, and the contractor, such as \nentities with public service obligations, which will be given longer payment periods. But any \nviolation of the special rules will allow the contractor to discontinue its services to them. The key \ndevelopment partners such as ADB, the EBRD and the World Bank will be observers on EDN\u2019s \nsupervisory board and receive monitoring results. The contract also includes a dispute settlement \nmechanism by a third-party panel of experts so that any issues would have a better chance of \nresolution before escalating into disputes. Finally, a separate ADB TA will finance supervision \nassistance through the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility (para. 32) in the form of three \nindependent advisors, which will strengthen implementation monitoring as designed in the PPPF.  \n \n19.  Output 4: Sector\u2019s reform and operational capacity strengthened (policy and project). \nGuided by the success of the SOPI program, the program\u2019s project component includes a \nrecruitment of a consulting firm to support the government\u2019s further reforms. This will help the \nimplementation of the PPPF as part of the program\u2019s policy component, which includes the next \nphase of the unbundling process such as finalizing opening balance sheets and commercial \ncontracts based on regulator-set tariffs, and completion of the restructuring of loans from MOF. \nThe consulting firm will also closely monitor the implementation with regard to the escrow account, \nthe regulator, the tariff methodology, and the management contractor performance. \n \n20.  Furthermore,  the  comprehensive  reforms  present  an  unprecedented  opportunity  for \nstepping up gender development in the subsector. The attached TA (para. 33) will support the \nunbundled companies in conducting gender assessments and creating an employee database \nthat  will  inform  policies  and  training  on  corporate  gender  mainstreaming  (para.  12).  The \nmanagement contractor\u2019s tasks also include the establishment of a gender working group in EDN \n(para. 17) to develop policies and training on the prevention of sexual harassment. The metering \ninvestment will provide more opportunities for women's employment, especially at the data and \ncall centers. The attached TA will also provide internship and training grants to selected women \ntrainees. In addition, an ongoing ADB grant in the education sector will establish a technical skills \ndevelopment center for the energy sector with a focus on increased female employment.16 The \nimproved gender policies of the key employers in the energy sector and the skills development \nopportunities will create synergy and amplify the effect of the gender action plans of both projects.  \n \n21.  Output 5: Retail billing and collection systems modernized (project). The program\u2019s \nproject component will finance investments in advanced retail electricity metering and low- and \nmedium-voltage grid enhancements in seven priority cities (Buston, Dangara, Dushanbe, Isfara, \nIstravshan, Konibodom, and Panjekent), which were selected based on the urgency of collection \nimprovements. The planned installation of about 370,000 meters will cover close to 40% of the \ncustomer base and demand. Dushanbe accounts for nearly 25% of the country\u2019s electricity sales, \nmaking improved revenue collection there a top priority for the subsector. The advanced metering \nand billing system will reduce the cost of metering and billing, lower outage costs, and improve \nthe quality of supply for customers (e.g., faster outage restoration and more precise dispatching \nof repair crews to the sites of network breakdowns). It will also allow the introduction of new billing \nschemes, such as step tariffs, to protect vulnerable customers in newly metered cities.  \n \n16 ADB. 2020.

The program outputs will lead to the outcome of improved financial sustainability of the \npower subsector.17 The program is aligned with the impact of sustainable access to energy \nresources.18 It targets an improved nationwide collection rate of 91% by 2027 against 86% in \n2017 and reduced distribution losses in target cities from 15.2% in 2019 to 7.3% in 2027. EDN\u2019s \nnet profit is also expected to improve based on the management contractor\u2019s assessment, and \nthe tariffs are targeted to reach cost recovery levels by 2025. The program\u2019s outcome will also \nlead to the subsector\u2019s reduced reliance on the government such as re-lending and contribute to \nthe better fiscal management for the country.   \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s SOPI program under the Regional Power Transmission Project (footnote 2) has \nsupported  the  reform  activities  since  2012.  Its  market  development  report  in  2016  is  the \nfoundation of the comprehensive reforms supported by the program.19 The government used the \nSOPI platform for development partner coordination, which led to the formulation of the joint \nreform program. The proposed program will support the upfront policy actions, and its sector \nreform support component (output 4) and the World Bank\u2019s program-for-result grant (footnote 13) \nwill assist and provide incentives for the continued implementation of the policy actions. An ADB-\nfunded feasibility study paved the way for the EBRD to cofinance the metering investment, which \nwill provide expertise from the successful Sugd project and implement a youth and women's \neducation program. The mix of ADB grant and EBRD loan is the outcome of close consultation \nwith the government and the IMF to optimize the available financing sources for Tajikistan. \n \n24.  The financial crisis in the Tajik power subsector is profound and recovery requires actions \nthat simultaneously address sector governance, debts, tariffs, and management. Yet the impact \nwill be limited without improving the accuracy in sales, timely collections, and system losses, and \nthis can only be achieved by investments in adequate metering and billing systems. In turn, any \ninvestments in the subsector also require much improved corporate governance for the unbundled \nutility companies to be sustainable. The sector development program approach is used to support, \nthrough the policy-based component, structural reforms that create an enabling environment for \nfinancial  sustainability,  and  to  respond,  through  the  project  component,  to  the  investment \nchallenges in the power subsector. Since the near-term priority of the subsector will be the \nimplementation and deepening of the major reforms completed under this program, a stand-alone \npolicy component with PPPF and implementation support (output 4) was selected.  \n \n25.  Lessons  from  previous  policy-based  engagements  include  the  need  for  strong \ngovernment ownership of reforms, development partner collaboration, long-term engagement \nwith  investment  support,  and  adequate  monitoring  and  capacity  development  support.20 \nIncorporating these lessons, the program was developed with the EBRD and the World Bank. Key \nreform actions such as the unbundling and the management contract were introduced with the \nstrong leadership in the office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the MOEWR. An assessment of \npast electricity metering projects in Tajikistan during the feasibility study showed that the usability \nof the billing system is critical to its success. The project design therefore adopts the billing system \nalready used by EDN and developed through the EBRD-financed project in Sugd (para. 10).  \n \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 Government of Tajikistan. 2016.

Finally, the program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priorities \n1 (reducing  poverty  and  inequalities);  2  (accelerating  gender  equality);  3  (building  climate, \ndisaster,  and  environmental  resilience);  6 (strengthening  governance  and  institutions);  and \n7 (fostering regional cooperation and integration).21 Stronger competitiveness of power utilities is \nkey to Tajikistan\u2019s role as a regional hydropower hub, especially in the expanding trade with \nneighboring countries and South Asia. The preparation and implementation support for the \nmanagement contract is a result of the One-ADB approach by ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment and its Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates, Financing Plan, Development Financing Needs, and \nBudget Support \n \n27.  The total program cost is $145 million, $20 million of which is the policy-based component. \nThe project component is estimated to cost $125 million (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates for Project Component ($ million) \nItem              Amount a \nA.

The government has requested (i) a policy-based grant not exceeding $20 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), (ii) a grant (project grant) not \nexceeding $85 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help \nfinance the program, and (iii) a loan of $25 million from the EBRD. The project grant of $85 million \nwill be provided to the Republic of Tajikistan, of which $82.5 million will be on-granted to EDN as \nan equity injection and $2.5 million will be provided to the MoEWR. The EBRD will enter into a \nseparate loan agreement with EDN. The EBRD loan is non-ADB administered, but ADB will \noversee procurement. The government and EDN will contribute counterpart financing of $15 \nmillion to the project component in the form of exemptions from all taxes and duties (including \nvalue-added and customs duties) on project expenditures other than income tax or social tax. \n \n29.  The policy-based grant size is based on the development impact of the policy reform \npackage, development spending arising from the key energy sector reforms, and fiscal shortfalls \nestimated at $735 million for 2020 (Table 2). It is also considered in close coordination with the \nrecently approved COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program (footnote 5), \nthe $50 million Financial Sector and Fiscal Management Improvement Program (subject to ADB \n \n21 ADB. 2018.

Any shortfall \nduring  implementation  will  be  covered  by  the  government  and  EDN.  Climate  financing  is \nestimated to be $20 million based on 30% of the ADB financing for metering. The summary \nfinancing plan is in Table 3.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The MOEWR will be the program\u2019s executing agency, EDN the implementing agency. For \nthe project component, the government\u2019s centralized project management unit (PMU) for ADB-\nfinanced energy projects will be the implementation unit. While EDN is a new entity, it inherits the \ndistribution segment of Barqi Tojik, and the PMU and Barqi Tojik together have successfully \nmanaged seven ADB projects. Lessons from previous and ongoing projects show that the \ncontinuation  of  the  centralized  PMU  is  the  most  effective  implementation  structure.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the PAM.  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2019\u2013December 2020 (policy component) \nDecember 2020\u2013March 2026 (project component) \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2026 \n \n22 IMF. 2020.

Procurement  under  the  project  component  of  the  program  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), with advance \ncontracting.24 As the EBRD and ADB will jointly finance an individual procurement package under \nthe project component, universal procurement will apply for civil works, goods, and consulting \nservices financed under the program. Advance actions for procurement of consulting services \nand civil works were taken to facilitate project implementation. Further, given that EDN\u2019s system \nis  relatively small (1.3 million  customers),  having  multiple  billing  systems  will  increase the \noperational inefficiencies. Since EDN has been successfully operating the billing system of the \nEBRD-financed Sugd project (para. 10), the expansion of the existing system is the most practical \nand economical option. Therefore, direct contracting of the same contractor for the billing systems \npackage is justified under paragraph 2.17(e) of the Procurement Regulations because it will be a \nnatural extension of the earlier work completed under the EBRD-financed Sugd project (in which \nthe contractor was competitively selected). The engagement of the same contractor will be more \neconomical and will ensure compatibility of results in terms of quality of work.  \n \n32.  Further, the program is supported by additional TA support of $955,000 from the Asia \nPacific Project Preparation Facility for the implementation of the management contract.25 The TA \nwill provide independent advisors in the technical, commercial, and financial areas to oversee the \ncontractor\u2019s performance and to explore further public\u2013private partnership options (para. 18). \n \n \n \n24 All procurement and recruitment packages except for sector reform support were advertised before ADB Board \nconsideration.

The  program  includes  a  regional  cluster  TA  subproject  to  counter  women's  limited \nemployment chances in technical occupations with on-the-job training for female students and \ngraduates of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. The TA will \nsupport gender assessments at the unbundled companies to underpin the formulation of gender \nmainstreaming policies.26 The estimated TA cost is $200,000, to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n34.  Under the SOPI program, EDN commissioned a feasibility study for metering and network \nupgrades in seven cities. The study reviewed international practice, identified technical options \nsuitable for EDN, prepared the technical design, identified project benefits and costs, and \npresented an implementation plan. The study confirmed that (i) the project was in line with \nworldwide utility practice, (ii) the equipment and systems were proven and widely available, and \n(iii) EDN staff had proven their capability to operate such systems based on their experience with \na project using the same technology in the Sugd region. The cost estimates were updated in June \n2020, considering the global impact of COVID-19. Further, EDN is the former distribution arm of \nBarqi Tojik and has run the system since 2008, thus having sufficient experience and capacity for \ndeveloping and operating the distribution system. ADB is satisfied with the proposed technology \nand implementation plan, and EDN\u2019s ability to operate the system. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n35.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  metering  investment  were  conducted.  The \ninvestment covers the capital city of Dushanbe and other priority cities in Tajikistan. Improvements \nin collections and a reduction in system losses in these cities are critical to the financial recovery \nof the subsector. The investment is expected to increase the collection rate by 8 percentage points \nand reduce system losses by 7.9 percentage points collectively in the target cities. Given the \nlimited size and the current low quality of the power distribution system, assessments conclude \nthat these improvements are reasonable compared with systems of similar size and condition.  \n \n36.  With these assumptions, the financial internal rate of return, estimated from EDN\u2019s \nperspective, is 14.4%, above EDN\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital of 5.0%. The \neconomic internal rate of return, estimated from the Tajik economy\u2019s perspective, is 12.0%, higher \nthan the threshold of 9.0%. Sensitivity analyses also supported the financial and economic \nviability of the investment.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n37.  The key factor for the program's sustainability is the continued implementation of reforms. \nThis will be monitored through the engagement of consultants for the MOEWR through sector \nreform support. The disbursement indicators of the parallel World Bank program (footnote 13) will \nalso act as an incentive mechanism for reforms and as a monitoring platform. The management \n \n26 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \ncontractor is expected to improve the overall corporate governance of EDN, which will be the \nbasis of the utility\u2019s sustainable operation and the ADB-financed metering investment.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n38.  Anticorruption measures. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and EDN. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe program. To support these efforts, the applicable provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy \nare included in the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB under the \nproject component shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the executing and implementing agencies, and of all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers related to the project component. Entity-level \nintegrity due diligence conducted on EDN found no significant integrity risks.27 Integrity due \ndiligence of EDN board members and senior managers will be done once they are appointed. \n \n39.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines and concludes that EDN\u2019s overall financial management risk \nis high. The key risks relate to the weaknesses of Barqi Tojik that EDN inherits. Issues reported \nin the 2018 audited financial statements\u2014concerning (i) valuation of inventory, revaluation of \nassets, records on account receivables and payables, and data conciliation of revenues; (ii) lack \nof an effective internal audit function and information technology system;and (iii) inconsistent data \nconsolidation  of  30  subordinate  entities\u2014will  require  resolution.  A  timebound  financial \nmanagement action plan was prepared to mitigate the identified risks and was agreed among \nADB, EDN, and the MOEWR as described in the PAM. The management contractor, the project \nimplementation consultants, and the sector reform support component will provide necessary \nassistance in the implementation. The financial management risk will continue to be monitored as \nEDN\u2019s operation is established with the management contractor.   \n \n40.  Procurement. The procurement capacities of the MOEWR, EDN, and the PMU were \nassessed and do not pose a significant risk to project implementation. The MOEWR has previous \nexperience from recruiting and managing the SOPI consultants. While EDN is a new entity, its \nworkforce comes directly from Barqi Tojik. EDN also works with the government PMU dedicated \nto energy sector projects, which has performed well in the ongoing ADB-funded projects. The \nprocurement methods are selected to align with the needs of each package. Value for money with \nregard to the procurement of smart meters will be achieved through (i) a single contract package \nto  be  tendered  internationally,  (ii)  the  one-stage  procurement  method,  and  (iii) the  lowest \nevaluated cost as qualification criterion. As regards the selection of the management contractor, \nthe value for money lies in (i) market outreach, (ii) fixed budget selection, and (iii) use of a fit-for-\npurpose form of contract, and for the extension of the billing system, direct contracting applies. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n41.  The sector development program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will \naddress  women\u2019s  limited  participation  in the  power  subsector.  Key  gender  actions  include \n(i) corporate  strategy  reforms  to  include  women  in  management  positions;  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment of staff and management on gender and customer service management, and \n \n27 ADB. 2003.

On the demand side, training on the advanced \nmetering system will be provided to targeted households, while awareness raising on energy \nsafety and efficiency will be provided to the beneficiary communities, including on-the-job training \nfor female graduates of STEM courses. A gender diagnostic of each of the unbundled companies \nas well as the current STEM course offerings and their enrollment will be done to identify how to \nincrease women's participation in the subsector. The gender action plan details the steps.28 The \nattached TA will help increase the pool of potential women technical workers in the power \nsubsector. The reforms will result in more efficient operations of the power companies and better \nprovision of energy services, including to underserved communities. Better services will in turn \nreduce women\u2019s time poverty, enable low-income families to pursue energy-based livelihood \nactivities, and allow schoolchildren and students to in learning activities at home.    \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n42.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project component\u2019s \nsafeguard  categories  are  as  follows.29  The  policy  actions  of  the  program  will  not  cause \nenvironmental or social impacts. \n \n43.  Environment  (category  B).  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) were prepared and disclosed. Potential environmental \nimpacts  of  the  project  component  relate  mainly  to  occupational  health  and  safety,  waste \ngeneration, noise, socioeconomic impacts and influx of workers, dust and exhaust emissions from \nequipment and construction vehicles, and construction traffic. The IEE will be updated when the \ndetailed design and site-specific information become available. All statutory clearances and \npermits will be obtained before construction works start. The contractors will be required to submit, \nas part of their bids, the expected costs of implementing the EMP, to ensure that sufficient \nresources are allocated for it. Each contractor will be required to submit to the PMU the site-\nspecific EMP with subplans prior to the start of civil works. The specific Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements will be described in the PAM. Environmental reporting to ADB will be \ndone on a semiannual basis and will continue until project completion. The IEE, environmental \nmonitoring reports, and corrective action plans, if any, will be disclosed on the ADB and project \nwebsites. Project-related complaints or grievances will be addressed through a grievance redress \nmechanism to be established for this project component.  \n \n44.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). All the proposed works under output 5 of the \nprogram will be within the existing facilities owned and controlled by EDN in the seven cities and \nselected substations. No works will be done on the premises of individual households. No land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impact is expected from these works.  \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project component's sites are in Dushanbe and \nsix other major cities (para. 21) where no groups reside that may be deemed indigenous people.  \n \nG.
