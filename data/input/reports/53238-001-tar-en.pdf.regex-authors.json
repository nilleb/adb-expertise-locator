THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Alignment  with  Asian  Development  Bank  strategies.  The  transaction  technical \nassistance (TA) facility will provide capacity building to projects in Nepal financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The facility will support ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for \nNepal, 2013\uf02d2017, the forthcoming CPS for Nepal, 2020\uf02d2024, and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.1 Given \nthe growth and increasing complexity of ADB\u2019s Nepal portfolio and the country\u2019s transition from a \ncentral system to a three-tiered federal system of governance, ADB\u2019s hands-on support for its \nNepal projects is essential. Hence, a TA facility is proposed to provide systematic and demand-\ndriven capacity development for project implementation and evaluation, to support tripartite \nportfolio review meetings (TPRMs), and to provide targeted capacity development for ongoing \nand pipeline projects to improve effective project implementation. The TA facility is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Nepal, 2019\uf02d2021, which is consistent with the \nextended CPS.2 ADB has discussed and reached an agreement with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) on the purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing plan, and terms \nof references of the TA facility.3 \n \n2.  Portfolio growth and challenges. ADB\u2019s active portfolio in Nepal as of the end of \nDecember 2018 stands at $2.8 billion, with 31 loans amounting to $2.5 billion and 18 investment \ngrants totaling $282.0 million. ADB\u2019s annual lending commitment to Nepal averaged $253 million \nannually during 2014\uf02d2016, then increased to $510 million in 2017 and to $592 million in 2018. \nThe forthcoming CPS envisages increasing this figure to about $600 million annually during 2020\u2013\n2024,  with  annual  contract  awards  and  disbursements  increasing  commensurately.  Nepal \ntransitioned to a three-tiered federal system of governance in FY2018, with federal, provincial, \nand local governments entrusted to execute development projects. Increasingly, provincial and \nlocal  governments  will  implement  ADB-funded  projects.  But  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  local \ngovernments suggests that they have limited capacity to meet ADB requirements. As provinces \nare  new  administrative  structures, capacity  strengthening  is  deemed  particularly  urgent for \nprovincial governments with no prior experience of engaging with ADB.  \n \n3.  Implementing the new federal structure and sustaining the performance of its active \nportfolio will be challenging for Nepal. Therefore, it is crucial to build the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies of federal, provincial, and local governments. Insufficient capacity affects \nproject performance in procurement, consultant recruitment, contract management, financial \nmanagement, safeguards, gender equality and social inclusion (GESI), and project monitoring \nand evaluation. Furthermore, during implementation, projects frequently encounter problems \nsurrounding  transfer  of  project  directors  and  other  key  project  staff,  so  regular  capacity \ndevelopment support is required. Hiring qualified contractors and consultants has been a problem; \nimproving the performance of contractors and consultants will require effective procurement \ndesign, regular performance monitoring, and solid control mechanisms. Issues surrounding land \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2013\u20132017. Manila.

The TA facility first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB website on 28 August 2018.  \n3  ADB received the confirmation on 1 July 2019. \n \n ", "2   \nacquisition,  resettlement,  forest  clearance,  and  ensuring  right-of-way  also  hamper  project \nimplementation. Resolving these issues will require improved interministerial coordination.  \n \n4.  Continued  engagement.  ADB  has  been  addressing  these  challenges  through  the \nCapacity  Development  Resource  Center  (CDRC),  which  was  established  in  the  Nepal \nAdministrative  Staff  College  (NASC)  through  ADB  TA  to  Nepal  for  Enhancing  Portfolio \nPerformance.4 From December 2015 to May 2019, the CDRC delivered 54 training programs to \nmore than 1,500 executing and implementing agencies staff working on ADB projects; these \ncovered topics such as environmental and social safeguards, GESI, procurement, consultant \nrecruitment,  contract  management,  financial  and  project  management,  and  preparation  of \nquarterly  project  progress  report.  The  CDRC  conducted  four  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement clinics. NASC and ADB identified the training topics through a training needs \nassessment. NASC and ADB delivered the training programs, ensuring they were locally relevant, \nresource-driven, and economical. The TA (footnote 4) also supported the establishment of \nTPRMs as an institutional mechanism to address project implementation issues and support the \nsuccessful completion and evaluation of projects. \n \n5.  The  TA  facility  will  support  the  continuation  of  demand-led  capacity  development \nprograms, improve the quality of these programs, and continue to support the CDRC as a key \nmechanism  for  delivering  capacity  development  programs.  One  lesson  learned  from  the \nEnhancing  Portfolio  Performance  TA  was  that  identifying  training  needs  for  specific  target \ngroups\u2014for  instance,  new  implementing  agencies  or  senior  officers\u2014yields  better  results. \nTherefore, the TA facility team will (i) conduct regular training needs assessments to identify \nspecific capacity gaps of selected agencies, (ii) upgrade training materials through feedback \nreceived from participants, and (iii) combine field-based training programs and clinic-style issue-\nresolution workshops with classroom training programs. The CDRC will closely coordinate and, \nwhere  feasible,  collaborate  with  ongoing  capacity  development  activities  supported  by  the \ngovernment and/or other development partners.5 The CDRC will help establish pools of local \ntrainers or resource persons in partnership with existing training institutes to institutionalize \ncapacity building. In addition, the TA facility will provide project implementation support on \nenvironmental and safeguard compliance, contract management, financial management, and \nproject management to critical ADB projects. ADB\u2019s Disaster Resilience of Schools Project will be \nsupported with capacity development in quality assurance of school designs, environmental and \nsocial safeguards compliance management, and financial management.6 The TA facility will \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2014.

The TA is due for closure \nin September 2019. \n5  For instance, the Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project implemented under a trust fund managed \nby the World Bank, which focuses on capacity development (specifically targeting procurement and financial \nmanagement) of the Financial Comptroller General Office, Office of the Auditor General, Public Procurement \nMonitoring Office, and key central and subnational government agencies. Another large project is the Provincial and \nLocal  Governance  Strengthening  Project  which  is  designed  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  sub-national \ngovernments to deliver public services. The project, which aims to start activities in 2020, is financed by the United \nKingdom Department for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Norway, \nthe European Union and United Nations Development Program, together with the Government of Nepal and includes,  \nthe development and strengthening of training centers in each provincial capital. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \nGeneral Administration will implement this project. In addition, the National Planning Commission has, as part of its \nmandate to support planning activities in the three-tiered federal system, prepared guidelines on planning, budgeting, \nand financial management for the subnational level, which can be a resource for capacity development activities. \n6  ADB. 2018.

Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Capacity development of executing and implementing agencies increased. \nThe TA facility will support the CDRC to conduct at least 50 capacity building programs to train \nabout 1,500 staff from the executing and implementing agencies of ongoing and pipeline projects \nand associated federal, provincial, and local government staff during 2019\uf02d2023 and to conduct \nfour clinics on procurement, social safeguards, financial management, and contract management \ntargeted at individual projects. These capacity building programs will cover ADB policies and \nprocedures,  project  implementation,  and  thematic  topics  for  improved  project  portfolio \nperformance, with an emphasis on field-level, clinic-style, issue-resolution workshops, including \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The TA facility will support \nthe CDRC to develop training programs based on capacity assessments of executing and \nimplementing agencies and periodic training-needs surveys. The topics covered will include \nprocurement, consultant  selection,  contract management,  project  management,  safeguards, \nGESI, financial management, and topics assessed from the periodic surveys. ADB staff from \nrelevant ADB departments will be consulted to develop training material and where appropriate \nengaged as resource persons in the capacity building programs to discuss international best \npractices. The TA facility will further enhance the online training nomination and registration \nsystem to improve efficiency on training administration through web-based nominations, selection \nof  participants,  trainee  database,  trainee  tracking,  and  training  logistics  management. \nDevelopment of e-learning modules for the capacity development activities implemented by \nCDRC, will also be supported. As part of the capacity development activities, the TA facility will \nsupport four business opportunity seminars to disseminate business opportunities to contractors \nand consultant organizations in collaboration with the World Bank and/or other development \npartners. The CDRC will conduct an impact assessment of training programs and improvements \nin monitoring and evaluation of portfolio results; this assessment will be used to improve the \nquality of capacity development. \n \n7.  Output 2: Cross-learning in between projects supported. The TA facility will support \ncross-learning between best practices in projects in Nepal as well as cross-learning learning from \nselected,  relevant  international  best  practices.  The  following  sub-outputs  are  proposed:  (i) \nrepresentatives from executing and/or implementing agencies will be invited for at least five field \nvisits  to  project  sites  from  successful  projects  for  hands-on  experience  on  good  project \nmanagement practices; (ii) lessons learned from at least three ADB projects will be documented \nto  facilitate  improved  project  implementation  and  evaluation;  and  (iii)  representatives  from \n                                                \nNepal Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program.

Output 3: Portfolio management improved. Improving the performance of ADB funded \nprojects in Nepal  will include (i) funding ten TPRMs of ongoing and pipeline projects to support \nthe quality and timeliness of implementation, including on-site performance reviews of specific \nprojects by the MOF; (ii) supporting the ongoing Disaster Resilience of Schools Project (footnote \n6) by providing consultancy support for quality assurance on school designs to improve school \nsafety and learning environments; and (iii) engaging individual consultants to provide capacity \ndevelopment support in procurement, contract management, financial management, reporting, \nsafeguards, gender, and other areas for ongoing and pipeline critical projects (footnote 7 lists \nexamples).10  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,650,00, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff, facilities for seminars \nand meetings, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The International Economic Cooperation and Coordination Division of the MOF will be the \nexecuting agency responsible for providing the strategic direction for the implementation of the \nTA  facility.  ADB\u2019s  Nepal  Resident  Mission  will  administer  the  TA  and  oversee  TA  facility \nimplementation, working closely with TA beneficiaries to ensure the effective use of TA facility \nresources. The travel cost of ADB and non-ADB resource persons will be met from the proposed \nTA.  \n \n11.  The TA team, through the TA facility, will provide workshops, conferences, and training \nprograms through the national training institute. The national training institute proposed to be \nengaged to operate the CDRC, will host the online training nomination and registration system. \n \n12.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table.  \n \n                                                \n8  The cross-learning on safe schools will benefit the Disaster Resilience of Schools Project (footnote 6). The cross-\nlearning on livable cities will benefit the Nepal Energy Authority and the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, which \nimplement energy projects; and the Ministry of Water Supply, the Ministry of Urban Development, and selected \nmunicipalities that implement urban projects. The cross-learning on value chain development will benefit the Ministry \nof Agriculture and selected provincial and local governments. \n9  ADB staff from relevant departments staff will be consulted and or engaged as resource persons for implementing \ncross-learning activities. \n10  ADB will update, as needed, the design and monitoring frameworks of ongoing projects to reflect the outputs and \nactivities of the TA facility. The updated versions of these frameworks will be included in the project administration \nmanuals of the supported projects.  \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2019\u2013September 2023  \nExecuting agency  International Economic Cooperation and Coordination Division of the Ministry \nof Finance \nImplementing agency  International Economic Cooperation and Coordination Division of the Ministry \nof Finance \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nSelection method  Selection title  $ (amount) \nICS  10 individual consultants  470,000.00 \nDirect contracting  Capacity building contract  550,000.00 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Consulting services. ADB will recruit eight individual national consultants for 111 person-\nmonths and two individual international consultant for 12.5 person-months. 11 ADB will engage \nthe consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nits associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.12 Furthermore, seven \nnational consultants for 53 person-months will be recruited through a firm (NASC), which is \nsubject to ADB\u2019s approval. Appendix 2 has details on the allocation of consultants to the projects \nsupported by the TA facility. \n \n14.  Given the diverse nature of the deliverables and the specialized expertise required, ADB \nwill recruit some of the experts based on the individual consultant selection method. It is expected \nthat NASC will deliver the capacity development training activities. NASC is an autonomous \ntraining entity designated by the government to develop and conduct training programs for \ngovernment staff. NASC employs well-experienced trainers in the area of procurement, financial \nmanagement, social safeguards, and GESI; has faculties with dedicated training units that are \nable to administer training events, including preparation of training materials in local languages; \nand owns a campus with an adequate number of training halls and a hostel for residential training \nwith a 24-hour electricity supply. NASC has been providing similar services for ADB since 2015 \nunder the Enhancing Portfolio Performance TA project, and no other national firms are able to \nprovide these services. Therefore, it is proposed that NASC be selected to provide training \nthrough  direct  contracting,  per  para.  86(ii)  of  the  Staff  Instructions  on  ADB-administered \nconsulting  services,  which  indicates  that  direct  contracting  can  be  applied  when  only  one \nconsultant is qualified or has experience of exceptional worth of the relevant assignment.13 \n \nII.
