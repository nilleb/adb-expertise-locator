I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Power Sector Rehabilitation \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will (i) rehabilitate Toktogul hydroelectric power plant (HEPP) by replacing \nexisting mechanical and electrical equipment, (ii) establish an electricity transactions settlement \ncenter, (iii) conduct a safety assessment of dams on the Naryn cascade, and (iv) conduct a \npublic information program on sector reforms. The project2 will improve energy supply, reduce \nsystem commercial losses, identify dam rehabilitation measures, and inform the public on sector \ndevelopments.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic power sector is characterized by aging assets, high commercial \nlosses, below-cost tariffs, and poor performance of sector companies. The project addresses \nthese issues by (i) rehabilitating the 1,200-megawatt Toktogul HEPP, which is critical for national \nand regional power supply; (ii) establishing the Kyrgyz electricity settlement center (KESC), which \nwill reduce commercial losses and improve sector financial performance; (iii) assessing the safety \ncondition of dams on the Naryn cascade and identifying remedial measures; and (iv) conducting a \npublic information program to gain support for sector reforms. \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked Central Asian country with a low per capita income \n(ranked  186  in  the  world);  small  area  (200,000  square  kilometers);  and  low  population \n(5.55 million). The country enjoys abundant hydropower potential owing to its mountainous \nterrain covering 80% of the country. The Kyrgyz Republic is a net exporter of electricity to the \nregional Central Asian power system (CAPS). \n \n5.  Total  installed  generation  capacity  is  3,863  megawatts,  of  which  81%  comes  from \nHEPPs and 19% from thermal combined heat and power plants (CHPPs). Toktogul HEPP and \nother HEPPs in the downstream Naryn cascade have produced an average of 92% of the total \ncountry electricity output since 2002. Almost 100% of the population is connected to the electric \ngrid.  Toktogul  HEPP,  with  multiyear  storage  capacity  and  producing  50%  of  the  average \nelectricity output, plays a critical role as an export source and a frequency regulator of the \nCAPS. \n \n6.  The country is the largest net exporter of electricity to the CAPS, with average annual \nexports of 2,100 gigawatt-hours (GWh) since 2002. Exports of hydro-based electricity occur \nduring summer when electricity is produced above domestic demand; this is associated with \nwater release for regional irrigation needs. Coal, oil, and gas are imported during winter to \nsupply CHPPs. However, winter demand is not met because of (i) limitation of hydro generation \ncaused by water release constraints, (ii) insufficient CHPP capacity, and (iii) lack of import \nsources with surplus electricity. Unserved winter demand is estimated at 20% of total supply or \n1,200 GWh. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to Power Sector Rehabilitation Project. Manila (TA 7704-KGZ). \n \n ", "2  \n \n  \n7.  Power assets are generally over 30 years old and approaching the end of their economic \nlife. This results in reed reliability and high system technical losses (15% of net supply). Despite \nmodest domestic growth forecast at 1.5% per annum, major rehabilitation, replacement, and \naugmentation of power sector assets is required. The sector also suffers from high commercial \nlosses (25% of net supply), poor financial management and performance, and tariffs below cost \nrecovery. \n \n8.  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has identified $4 billion of planned investments \nin the power sector from 2012 to 20173 This is consistent with required investments of $6 billion \nfrom 2012 to 2022, as identified in a sector study financed by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).4 Required  investments  include  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  thermal  and \nhydropower  plants  and  transmission  and  distribution  assets.  Financing  for  future  sector \ninvestments is being coordinated through the ADB-sponsored Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation program. The project addresses a time slice of required sector investments. \n \n9.  Considering the extent of financing available and the critical importance of HEPPs, the \ngovernment identified rehabilitation of HEPPs as a top priority. An assessment of HEPPs on the \nNaryn cascade was conducted and it was concluded that all HEPPs require rehabilitation; \nrehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP was identified as the first priority. Failure of Toktogul HEPP \nwould affect the stability of the CAPS and be catastrophic for the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s electric \nsupply. Toktogul HEPP has been in operation for over 35 years, but no large rehabilitation has \nbeen undertaken. Critical equipment is failing, resulting in availability dropping to 80%. It is \nconsidered  that  availability  rates  will  continue  to  drop  in  the  absence  of  rehabilitation.  A \ncomplete  rehabilitation  of  primary  and  secondary  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  is \nrequired. \n \n10.  A phased rehabilitation program of Toktogul HEPP has been prepared. The project \nincludes the replacement of secondary electrical and mechanical equipment, which has been \nidentified as the first priority. Replacement of this equipment is critical as failure could result in \nloss of the total station output for over 1 year. Following completion of the priority phase, further \nrehabilitation should be done on a turbine and generator unit basis as part of future sector \ninvestments. The rehabilitation work to be carried out under the project is independent of future \nphases and is required regardless of timing of implementation of future phases. \n \n11.  Except for Kambarata 2, dams on the Naryn cascade were designed and built from 1960 \nto 1980. Since then, international design criteria for dam hydrological and seismic safety have \nbecome more stringent. Naryn hydropower plants lie in an active seismic zone, increasing the \ngeological hazard of rockfalls and landslides. Furthermore, existing dam designs may not cater \nfor  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  hydrology  and  variation  in  seasonal  flow  rates.  The \nstructural safety of the dams needs to be assessed and dam monitoring procedures reviewed. A \ndam safety assessment study of Naryn cascade dams is essential to identify required remedial \nmeasures and is proposed as part of the project. Impacts of climate change will be identified in \na separate study to be financed by the Global Environment Fund. \n \n12.  Tariffs are below cost recovery, with a weighted average consumer tariff of $0.022 per \nkilowatt-hour. It is estimated that a weighted average tariff of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour is required \n                                                \n3  Ministry of Energy and Industry.

Manila (TA 7558-REG). \n \n   ", "3 \n \nfor full cost recovery. A review of the tariff policy is being conducted, with general acceptance \nfrom all sections of the government that tariffs must be raised. The Ministry of Energy and \nIndustry (MOE) draft energy strategy includes a target of reaching the full cost recovery tariff by \n2016.  Nevertheless,  the  government  is  concerned  about  implementing  tariff  reform  after \nnegative  public  reaction  in  2010  following  tariff  increases  (which  have  since  been  partly \nreversed). A public information program as part of the project will be carried out in 2013 to \ninform the population on (i) experiences in similar countries, (ii) ongoing sector developments \nand reforms, and (iii) benefits to be achieved from an effective tariff policy.  \n \n13.  High commercial losses and poor sector financial performance are partly attributable to \ninadequate  wholesale  and  retail  metering;  and  poor  procedures  for  distribution  of  sector \nrevenues to generation, transmission, and distribution companies. Reliable and current data on \nenergy flows are not available, which impedes identification of losses. In addition, distribution of \nsector revenues by the MOE is based on operational priorities and carried out in an inconsistent \nmanner\u2014preventing proper financial planning by power companies, including open joint-stock \ncompany Electric Power Plants (EPP), the owner of Toktogul HEPP. \n \n14.  Projects to improve retail metering, under funding from the Government of Germany, \nand  wholesale  metering,  under  ADB  funding,5 are  under  implementation.  The  wholesale \nmetering project will introduce an automated metering and data acquisition system that will \nidentify domestic and international energy flows. Also under implementation under the ADB \nproject is a study6 on the corporate structure,  organizational design, and technical system \nconfiguration for the proposed KESC. \n \n15.  KESC, to be established as part of the project, will take over control of distribution of \nsector revenues. KESC will use the automated metering and data acquisition system to identify \nenergy flows and manage distribution of sector revenues in a transparent manner in accordance \nwith a defined methodology, allowing sector companies to conduct prudent financial planning \nand budgeting. KESC will also publish details of energy flows  between sector companies. \nEnergy flows to distribution companies from transmission substations will be identified for each \noutgoing  distribution  feeder,  allowing  identification  of  energy  flows  on  a  district  basis.  By \nidentifying the gap between energy flows and energy sales, commercial losses can be identified \non a district basis. This information will allow distribution companies to focus commercial loss \nreduction programs on high loss districts, increasing the effectiveness of such programs. Public \nrelease of commercial loss figures on a district basis will also increase pressure on distribution \ncompanies to reduce losses in a measurable and time-bound manner. \n \n16.  The government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component \nof its development plan.7 The project is aligned with the government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategy to \n(i) reduce electricity losses and theft, (ii) improve sector financial performance and corporate \nmanagement, (iii) increase energy security through the development of domestic resources, \n(iv) expand regional power exports, and (v) phase in cost-recovery tariffs over the medium term. \nThe project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2011-2012.8   \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

The impact will be increased reliability of national and regional power systems. This will \nbe achieved by (i) improving Toktogul HEPP performance, which will allow average exports to \nbe  maintained;  and  (ii)  increasing  domestic  sales  to  cover  demand  increase  and  winter \nunserved demand. The outcome will be improved operational performance of the power sector. \nThis will be achieved by increasing time when Toktogul HEPP is availabile for operation, and \nreducing commercial losses. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  Outputs will be as follows: \n(i)  rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP by replacing existing secondary electrical and \nmechanical equipment with new equipment to include (a) 500-kilovolt cables, \n(b) an excitation system, (c) a governor system, (d) generator circuit breakers, \nand (e) spare stator windings; \n(ii)  establishment of KESC, with operation by an international firm for an initial 2-year \nperiod, and national staff recruited and trained to take over after the initial period; \n(iii)  a dam safety assessment study that will assess the condition of dams on the \nNaryn cascade, with necessary remedial measures identified; and \n(iv)  conduct  of  a  public  information  program  that  will  raise  public  awareness  of \ndevelopments in the electricity sector and the benefits of reform. \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR9,703,000,  and  a  grant  not  exceeding  $40,000,000,  both  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing and \nproject agreements. ADB will finance a total of $55,000,000 equivalent. The government will \nallocate $5,400,000 to the MOE for the establishment of KESC, a public information program, \nand a dam safety assessment. The remaining $49,600,000 will be relent to EPP to fund the \nturnkey  rehabilitation  contract,  consulting  services  for  project  implementation,  and  external \naudit. The relending is for a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest \nrate of 1.5% per annum. Foreign exchange risk will be borne by EPP. \n \n21.  The financial plan is in Table 2. The government and EPP will contribute $7 million to the \nproject,  including  the  financing  or  exemption  of  taxes  and  duties.  The  government  will \n(i) allocate additional funds from the budget to cover  taxes and duties accrued on  project \nexpenditures, or (ii) exempt the project from such taxes and duties, or (iii) ensure that MOE and \nEPP have other financial resources sufficient to cover such taxes and duties.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n25.  An international consulting firm was recruited under the project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) to conduct due diligence of the rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP. The project \npreparatory TA consultant identified that secondary electrical and mechanical equipment was \nbeyond its economic life and needed to be replaced as a top priority. Suitable replacement \nequipment is available in the international market; it is proven technology and is appropriate for \nToktogul  site  conditions.  The  project  preparatory  TA  consultant  has  prepared  technical \nspecifications for a turnkey contractor to design, manufacture, install, and commission the new \nequipment in accordance with industry practice. Firms qualified to perform the turnkey contract \nare available in the international market. The turnkey contractor will train EPP staff in operation \nand maintenance. \n \n26.    The standard approach for rehabilitation of a hydropower plant aims to extend the \nexpected  lifetime  of  the  power  plant  by  30\u201340  years.  The  project  addresses  the  priority \ncomponents requiring immediate rehabilitation in Toktogul HEPP. This will bring early benefits \nsuch as increasing the average plant availability from 80% to 90% to allow increased output. \nThis will cover expected deterioration in output of other hydro and thermal plants, allowing a    \n10-year average generation output of 13.2 GWh to be maintained or slightly increased. \n \n27.  The reduction in commercial losses, from 25% to 10% of net supply, represents a saving \nof  1,500  GWh  based  on  2010  net  Kyrgyz  Republic  supply  of  10,100  GWh  and  sales  of \n6,100 GWh. It is assumed that 50% of this saving will result in reduced demand and 50% in new \nsales. Based on a forecast demand increase of 1.5% per annum, total sales by 2017 can reach \n7,600 GWh. With 13.2 GWh of generation output and total losses at 25% of domestic supply \n \n   ", "7 \n \n(15% technical and 10% commercial), excess over domestic demand and losses amount to \n2,300 GWh. This excess can allow 10-year average exports to be maintained while making a \ncontribution  to  unserved  demand.  Requirements  for  exports  to  be  made  during  summer \n(resulting from regional irrigation needs), combined with high winter domestic demand, mean \nthat exports cannot be cancelled to meet winter unserved demand. \n \n28.  Following the priority phase of rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP, rehabilitation should be \ndone on a turbine and generator unit basis. Each unit with all its auxiliary systems should be \nrefurbished and rehabilitated. The mechanical components (such as the turbine runner and \nwicket gate) should be replaced by state-of-the art equipment to increase efficiency, output, and \nenhance the range of operation. The entire control and protection systems and the supervision, \ncontrol, and data acquisition system should be replaced to optimize operation of the power plant \nand the whole Naryn cascade. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  Rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP has been identified as the least-cost solution for reliable \npower supply to the country and the CAPS. Toktogul HEPP also provides frequency regulation \nservices for the regional transmission grid without any equivalent alternatives in the country. \n \n30.  The economic internal rate of return is calculated at 21.3%, which compares favorably \nwith the 12% opportunity cost of capital.10 The project\u2019s economic viability takes into account \nstreams of costs and benefits resulting from the rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP and operation \nover the project\u2019s life. The incremental benefits come from avoided outages and major incidents \nand associated repair costs, and reduced energy import. Regional economic benefits are not \nincluded in the economic internal rate of return calculations since they accrue to countries other \nthan the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n31.  The financial internal rate of return is calculated at 12.3%, which compares favorably \nwith the weighted average cost of capital (1.1%). Financial viability was gauged by comparing \nthe revenue and cost streams of scenarios with and without the project. The results of a \nsensitivity analysis support the project\u2019s robust economic and financial viability even under \nunfavorable circumstances.  \n \n32.  EPP has difficulty in financial planning and budgeting because of insufficient control over \nits revenue. EPP\u2019s revenue is primarily dependent on the tariff set by the regulator (a division of \nthe  MOE)  and  the  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  distribution  among  the  four  distribution \ncompanies, the National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, and EPP. The MOE determines revenue \ndistribution based on the financial liquidity of sector participants. EPP\u2019s revenue is suppressed if \nsystem losses increase and tariff collection decreases. Increased revenue predictability through \na  more  transparent  mechanism,  together  with  a  higher  tariff,  will  facilitate  EPP\u2019s  proper \noperation and investment required to ensure energy security and financial sustainability. The \nKESC to be established under the project will ensure predictable distribution of sector revenues. \n \nC.  Governance \n33.  Improving sector governance is a high priority of the government and of development \npartners. The project will support this aim through public disclosure by KESC of commercial \nlosses and sector funds flow and through public disclosure of government sector policies and \n                                                \n10 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8  \n \nreforms via the public information program. The project is coordinated with related governance \ninitiatives by German development cooperation through KfW (distribution metering project), the \nUnited States Agency for International Development (management improvement of EPP), and \nthe World Bank (proposed regulation and transparency initiative). \n \n34.  A financial management assessment, including a risk management assessment, was \nprepared in accordance with ADB guidelines. Similar to the country\u2019s weak public financial \nmanagement, EPP\u2019s financial management capabilities are weak. Internal control is lacking, and \nadherence  to  accounting  standards,  disclosure,  and  auditing  requirement  is  insufficient.  A \nprocurement capacity assessment was also conducted, which found that procedures are not \nfollowed and capacity is weak. Building up financial management capabilities and effective \ninternal control and auditing, and improving procurement capacity and procedures, is critical to \nimproving corporate performance. This is being addressed under the Regional Energy Security, \nEfficiency and Trade Project of the United States Agency for International Development. \n \n35.  To bolster the corporate and financial management capacities of EPP and to ensure \ngovernance in project-related activities, the project will include the following measures: \n(i)  strengthening the existing PIU and maintaining separate project accounts, \n(ii)  recruiting  an  international  consulting  firm  to  provide  assistance  in  project \nimplementation, \n(iii)  establishing  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants, and \n(iv)  auditing project and corporate accounts annually in accordance with international \nstandards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and EPP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n37.  The public will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power sector. Since \nthe poor are the first to be cut off from supply during winter power shortages, system loss \nreduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor and socially excluded. \nDuring power cuts, the poor are disproportionally affected as they must rely on more expensive \nnonelectric energy sources. \n \n38.  The  project  does  not  entail  impacts  on  affordability  or  operational  employment \nopportunities.  During  construction,  the  turnkey  contractor  will  be  required  to  ensure  equal \nopportunities  for  all  social  groups,  equal  pay  for  equal  work  regardless  of  gender,  and \nprohibition of child labor. The contractor will also be required to undertake HIV/AIDS awareness \nactivities with imported workers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n39.  The  project  is  classified  environment  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), was prepared and the final version was disclosed on 14 May 2012 in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s public disclosure requirements. Public consultation was carried out and \n \n   ", "9 \n \nthe records have been included in the IEE. The PIU and the implementation consultant will \nupdate the IEE based on the detailed design by the turnkey contractor. \n \n40.  The main environmental impacts of the project include (i) occupational health and safety \nat the project site, (ii) management of the used oil and grease wastes, (iii) disposal of scrap \nmetal and other solid waste, and (iv) proper handing and monitoring of circuit breakers. The \nEMP specifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. \n \n41.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation,  with  assistance  from  the \nimplementation consultant and environmental specialists from EPP. Environmental monitoring \nwill be performed by the implementation consultant. Monitoring results will be included in the \nproject quarterly progress reports and semiannual environmental reports. \n \n42.  The cost for implementing the EMP will be covered by the loan and the grant. The costs \nof mitigation measures will be included in the turnkey contract, and the cost for environmental \nmonitoring will be included in the consulting services of the project implementation consultant. \n \n43.  The project is classified category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project investment will be implemented \nin  the  existing  Toktogul  HEPP  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  not \nenvisaged. The project is not expected to affect indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.
