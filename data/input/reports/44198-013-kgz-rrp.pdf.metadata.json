The  project2 will  improve  energy  supply,  reduce \nsystem commercial losses, identify dam rehabilitation measures, and inform the public on sector \ndevelopments.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n3. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  power  sector  is  characterized  by  aging  assets,  high  commercial \nlosses,  below-cost  tariffs,  and  poor  performance  of  sector  companies.  The  project  addresses \nthese issues by (i) rehabilitating the 1,200-megawatt Toktogul HEPP, which is critical for national \nand regional power supply; (ii) establishing the Kyrgyz electricity settlement center (KESC), which \nwill reduce commercial losses and improve sector financial performance; (iii) assessing the safety \ncondition of dams on the Naryn cascade and identifying remedial measures; and (iv) conducting a \npublic information program to gain support for sector reforms. \n \n4. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked Central Asian country with a low per capita income \n(ranked  186  in  the  world);  small  area  (200,000  square  kilometers);  and  low  population \n(5.55 million).  The  country  enjoys  abundant  hydropower  potential  owing  to  its  mountainous \nterrain covering 80% of the country. The Kyrgyz Republic is a net exporter of electricity to the \nregional Central Asian power system (CAPS). \n\n5. \nTotal  installed  generation  capacity  is  3,863  megawatts,  of  which  81%  comes  from \nHEPPs and 19% from thermal combined heat and power plants (CHPPs). Toktogul HEPP and \nother HEPPs in the downstream Naryn cascade have produced an average of 92% of the total \ncountry electricity output since 2002. Almost 100% of the population is connected to the electric \ngrid.  Toktogul  HEPP,  with  multiyear  storage  capacity  and  producing  50%  of  the  average \nelectricity  output,  plays  a  critical  role  as  an  export  source  and  a  frequency  regulator  of  the \nCAPS. \n \n6. \nThe  country  is  the  largest  net  exporter  of  electricity  to  the  CAPS,  with  average  annual \nexports  of  2,100  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  since  2002.  Exports  of  hydro-based  electricity  occur \nduring  summer  when  electricity  is  produced  above  domestic  demand;  this  is  associated  with \nwater  release  for  regional  irrigation  needs.  Coal,  oil,  and  gas  are  imported  during  winter  to \nsupply CHPPs. However, winter demand is not met because of (i) limitation of hydro generation \ncaused  by  water  release  constraints,  (ii)  insufficient  CHPP  capacity,  and  (iii)  lack  of  import \nsources with surplus electricity. Unserved winter demand is estimated at 20% of total supply or \n1,200 GWh. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2012.  Technical \n\nAssistance to Power Sector Rehabilitation Project. Manila (TA 7704-KGZ). \n\n1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2  \n \n\n  \n7. \nPower assets are generally over 30 years old and approaching the end of their economic \nlife. This results in reed reliability and high system technical losses (15% of net supply). Despite \nmodest  domestic  growth  forecast  at  1.5%  per  annum,  major  rehabilitation,  replacement,  and \naugmentation of power sector assets is required. The sector also suffers from high commercial \nlosses (25% of net supply), poor financial management and performance, and tariffs below cost \nrecovery. \n \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has identified $4 billion of planned investments \n8. \nin the power sector from 2012 to 20173 This is consistent with required investments of $6 billion \nfrom  2012  to  2022,  as  identified  in  a  sector  study  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). 4  Required  investments  include  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  thermal  and \nhydropower  plants  and  transmission  and  distribution  assets.  Financing  for  future  sector \ninvestments is being coordinated through the ADB-sponsored Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation program. The project addresses a time slice of required sector investments. \n \nConsidering  the  extent  of financing  available and  the  critical  importance of  HEPPs, the \n9. \ngovernment identified rehabilitation of HEPPs as a top priority. An assessment of HEPPs on the \nNaryn  cascade  was  conducted  and  it  was  concluded  that  all  HEPPs  require  rehabilitation; \nrehabilitation  of  Toktogul  HEPP  was  identified  as  the  first  priority.  Failure  of  Toktogul  HEPP \nwould  affect  the  stability  of  the  CAPS  and  be  catastrophic  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  electric \nsupply. Toktogul HEPP has been in operation for over 35 years, but no large rehabilitation has \nbeen  undertaken.  Critical  equipment  is  failing,  resulting  in  availability  dropping  to  80%.  It  is \nconsidered  that  availability  rates  will  continue  to  drop  in  the  absence  of  rehabilitation.  A \ncomplete  rehabilitation  of  primary  and  secondary  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  is \nrequired. \n \n10. \nA  phased  rehabilitation  program  of  Toktogul  HEPP  has  been  prepared.  The  project \nincludes  the  replacement  of  secondary  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  which  has  been \nidentified as the first priority. Replacement of this equipment is critical as failure could result in \nloss of the total station output for over 1 year. Following completion of the priority phase, further \nrehabilitation  should  be  done  on  a  turbine  and  generator  unit  basis  as  part  of  future  sector \ninvestments. The rehabilitation work to be carried out under the project is independent of future \nphases and is required regardless of timing of implementation of future phases. \n \n11. \nExcept for Kambarata 2, dams on the Naryn cascade were designed and built from 1960 \nto 1980. Since then, international design criteria for  dam hydrological and seismic safety have \nbecome more stringent. Naryn hydropower plants lie in an active seismic zone, increasing the \ngeological hazard of rockfalls and landslides. Furthermore, existing dam designs may not cater \nfor  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  hydrology  and  variation  in  seasonal  flow  rates.  The \nstructural safety of the dams needs to be assessed and dam monitoring procedures reviewed. A \ndam safety assessment study of Naryn cascade dams is essential to identify required remedial \nmeasures and is proposed as part of the project. Impacts of climate change will be identified in \na separate study to be financed by the Global Environment Fund. \n \n12. \nTariffs  are  below  cost  recovery,  with  a  weighted average consumer  tariff of  $0.022  per \nkilowatt-hour. It is estimated that a weighted average tariff of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour is required \n\n                                                \n3  Ministry of Energy and Industry. Energy Strategy, 2012\u20132017. Draft. \n4  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation for the Power Sector Regional \n\nMaster Plan. Manila (TA 7558-REG). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\ffor full  cost recovery.  A review  of the  tariff  policy  is  being  conducted,  with general  acceptance \nfrom  all  sections  of  the  government  that  tariffs  must  be  raised.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nIndustry (MOE) draft energy strategy includes a target of reaching the full cost recovery tariff by \n2016.  Nevertheless,  the  government  is  concerned  about  implementing  tariff  reform  after \nnegative  public  reaction  in  2010  following  tariff  increases  (which  have  since  been  partly \nreversed).  A  public  information  program  as  part  of  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in  2013  to \ninform  the  population  on  (i)  experiences  in  similar  countries,  (ii)  ongoing  sector  developments \nand reforms, and (iii) benefits to be achieved from an effective tariff policy.  \n \n13. \nHigh commercial losses and poor sector financial performance are partly attributable to \ninadequate  wholesale  and  retail  metering;  and  poor  procedures  for  distribution  of  sector \nrevenues to generation, transmission, and distribution companies. Reliable and current data on \nenergy flows are not available, which impedes identification of losses. In addition, distribution of \nsector revenues by the MOE is based on operational priorities and carried out in an inconsistent \nmanner\u2014preventing  proper  financial  planning  by  power  companies,  including  open  joint-stock \ncompany Electric Power Plants (EPP), the owner of Toktogul HEPP. \n \n14. \nProjects  to  improve  retail  metering,  under  funding  from  the  Government  of  Germany, \nand  wholesale  metering,  under  ADB  funding, 5  are  under  implementation.  The  wholesale \nmetering  project  will  introduce  an  automated  metering  and  data  acquisition  system  that  will \nidentify  domestic  and  international  energy  flows.  Also  under  implementation  under  the  ADB \nproject  is  a  study 6 on  the  corporate  structure,  organizational  design,  and  technical  system \nconfiguration for the proposed KESC. \n \nKESC,  to  be  established  as  part  of  the  project,  will  take  over  control  of  distribution  of \n15. \nsector revenues. KESC will use the automated metering and data acquisition system to identify \nenergy flows and manage distribution of sector revenues in a transparent manner in accordance \nwith  a  defined  methodology,  allowing  sector  companies  to  conduct  prudent  financial  planning \nand  budgeting.  KESC  will  also  publish  details  of  energy  flows  between  sector  companies. \nEnergy flows to distribution companies from transmission substations will be identified for each \noutgoing  distribution  feeder,  allowing  identification  of  energy  flows  on  a  district  basis.  By \nidentifying the gap between energy flows and energy sales, commercial losses can be identified \non  a  district  basis.  This  information  will  allow  distribution  companies  to  focus  commercial  loss \nreduction programs on high loss districts, increasing the effectiveness of such programs. Public \nrelease of commercial loss figures on a district basis will also increase pressure on distribution \ncompanies to reduce losses in a measurable and time-bound manner. \n \n16. \nThe government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component \nof  its  development  plan.7 The  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  strategy  to \n(i) reduce  electricity  losses  and  theft,  (ii)  improve  sector  financial  performance  and  corporate \nmanagement,  (iii)  increase  energy  security  through  the  development  of  domestic  resources, \n(iv) expand regional power exports, and (v) phase in cost-recovery tariffs over the medium term. \nThe project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2011-2012.8   \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

This will \nbe achieved by (i) improving  Toktogul HEPP performance, which will allow average exports to \nbe  maintained;  and  (ii)  increasing  domestic  sales  to  cover  demand  increase  and  winter \nunserved demand. The outcome will be improved operational performance of the power sector. \nThis  will  be  achieved  by  increasing  time  when  Toktogul  HEPP  is  availabile  for  operation,  and \nreducing commercial losses. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \n\nOutputs will be as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nrehabilitation  of  Toktogul  HEPP  by  replacing  existing  secondary  electrical  and \nmechanical  equipment  with  new  equipment  to  include  (a)  500-kilovolt  cables, \n(b) an  excitation  system,  (c)  a  governor  system,  (d)  generator  circuit  breakers, \nand (e) spare stator windings; \n\nestablishment of KESC, with operation by an international firm for an initial 2-year \nperiod, and national staff recruited and trained to take over after the initial period; \n\na  dam  safety  assessment  study  that  will  assess  the  condition  of  dams  on  the \nNaryn cascade, with necessary remedial measures identified; and \n\nconduct  of  a  public  information  program  that  will  raise  public  awareness  of \ndevelopments in the electricity sector and the benefits of reform. \n\nD. \n \n19. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $62 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA. \n\n  \n\n  \nBase Costa \n1  Rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP \n2  Consultants \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n \nC. \n\n \n\na.

The  project \npreparatory  TA  consultant  identified  that  secondary  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  was \nbeyond  its  economic  life  and  needed  to  be  replaced  as  a  top  priority.  Suitable  replacement \nequipment is available in the international market; it is proven technology and is appropriate for \nToktogul  site  conditions.  The  project  preparatory  TA  consultant  has  prepared  technical \nspecifications for a turnkey contractor to design, manufacture, install, and commission the new \nequipment in accordance with industry practice. Firms qualified to perform the turnkey contract \nare available in the international market. The turnkey contractor will train EPP staff in operation \nand maintenance. \n \n26.    The  standard  approach  for  rehabilitation  of  a  hydropower  plant  aims  to  extend  the \nexpected  lifetime  of  the  power  plant  by  30\u201340  years.  The  project  addresses  the  priority \ncomponents requiring  immediate rehabilitation  in Toktogul  HEPP. This  will  bring early  benefits \nsuch  as  increasing  the  average  plant  availability  from  80%  to  90%  to  allow  increased  output. \nThis  will  cover  expected  deterioration  in  output  of  other  hydro  and  thermal  plants,  allowing  a    \n10-year average generation output of 13.2 GWh to be maintained or slightly increased. \n \n27. \nThe reduction in commercial losses, from 25% to 10% of net supply, represents a saving \nof  1,500  GWh  based  on  2010  net  Kyrgyz  Republic  supply  of  10,100  GWh  and  sales  of \n6,100 GWh. It is assumed that 50% of this saving will result in reduced demand and 50% in new \nsales. Based on a forecast demand increase of 1.5% per annum, total sales by 2017 can reach \n7,600  GWh. With  13.2  GWh  of  generation  output  and  total  losses  at  25%  of  domestic  supply \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(15%  technical  and  10%  commercial),  excess  over  domestic  demand  and  losses  amount  to \n2,300  GWh.  This  excess  can  allow  10-year  average  exports  to  be  maintained  while  making  a \ncontribution  to  unserved  demand.  Requirements  for  exports  to  be  made  during  summer \n(resulting  from  regional  irrigation  needs),  combined  with  high  winter  domestic  demand,  mean \nthat exports cannot be cancelled to meet winter unserved demand. \n \n28. \nFollowing the priority phase of rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP, rehabilitation should be \ndone  on  a  turbine  and  generator  unit  basis.  Each  unit  with  all  its  auxiliary  systems  should  be \nrefurbished  and  rehabilitated.  The  mechanical  components  (such  as  the  turbine  runner  and \nwicket gate) should be replaced by state-of-the art equipment to increase efficiency, output, and \nenhance the range of operation. The entire control and protection systems and the supervision, \ncontrol, and data acquisition system should be replaced to optimize operation of the power plant \nand the whole Naryn cascade. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nRehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP has been identified as the least-cost solution for reliable \n29. \npower supply to the country and the CAPS. Toktogul HEPP also provides frequency regulation \nservices for the regional transmission grid without any equivalent alternatives in the country. \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  at  21.3%,  which  compares  favorably \n30. \nwith  the  12%  opportunity  cost  of  capital.10 The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  takes  into  account \nstreams of costs and benefits resulting from the rehabilitation of Toktogul HEPP and operation \nover the project\u2019s life. The incremental benefits come from avoided outages and major incidents \nand  associated  repair  costs,  and  reduced  energy  import.  Regional  economic  benefits  are  not \nincluded in the economic internal rate of return calculations since they accrue to countries other \nthan the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  at  12.3%,  which  compares  favorably \n31. \nwith the  weighted  average  cost  of capital  (1.1%).  Financial  viability  was gauged  by  comparing \nthe  revenue  and  cost  streams  of  scenarios  with  and  without  the  project.  The  results  of  a \nsensitivity  analysis  support  the  project\u2019s  robust  economic  and  financial  viability  even  under \nunfavorable circumstances.  \n \n32. \nEPP has difficulty in financial planning and budgeting because of insufficient control over \nits revenue. EPP\u2019s revenue is primarily dependent on the tariff set by the regulator (a division of \nthe  MOE)  and  the  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  distribution  among  the  four  distribution \ncompanies,  the  National  Electric  Grid  of  Kyrgyzstan,  and  EPP.  The  MOE  determines  revenue \ndistribution based on the financial liquidity of sector participants. EPP\u2019s revenue is suppressed if \nsystem losses increase and tariff collection decreases. Increased revenue predictability through \na  more  transparent  mechanism,  together  with  a  higher  tariff,  will  facilitate  EPP\u2019s  proper \noperation  and  investment  required  to  ensure  energy  security  and  financial  sustainability.  The \nKESC to be established under the project will ensure predictable distribution of sector revenues. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n33. \nImproving  sector  governance  is  a  high  priority  of  the  government  and  of  development \npartners.  The  project  will  support  this  aim  through  public  disclosure  by  KESC  of  commercial \nlosses  and  sector  funds  flow  and  through  public  disclosure  of  government  sector  policies  and \n\n                                                \n10 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8  \n \n\nreforms via the public information program. The project is coordinated with related governance \ninitiatives by German development cooperation through KfW (distribution metering project), the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (management  improvement  of  EPP),  and \nthe World Bank (proposed regulation and transparency initiative). \n \n34. \nA  financial  management  assessment,  including  a  risk  management  assessment,  was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Similar  to  the  country\u2019s  weak  public  financial \nmanagement, EPP\u2019s financial management capabilities are weak. Internal control is lacking, and \nadherence  to  accounting  standards,  disclosure,  and  auditing  requirement  is  insufficient.  A \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  was  also  conducted,  which  found  that  procedures  are  not \nfollowed  and  capacity  is  weak.  Building  up  financial  management  capabilities  and  effective \ninternal control and auditing, and improving procurement capacity and procedures, is critical to \nimproving corporate performance. This is being addressed under the Regional Energy Security, \nEfficiency and Trade Project of the United States Agency for International Development. \n \n35. \ngovernance in project-related activities, the project will include the following measures: \n\nTo  bolster  the  corporate  and  financial  management  capacities  of  EPP  and  to  ensure \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nstrengthening the existing PIU and maintaining separate project accounts, \nrecruiting  an  international  consulting  firm  to  provide  assistance  in  project \nimplementation, \nestablishing  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants, and \nauditing project and corporate accounts annually in accordance with international \nstandards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government  and  EPP. The  specific  policy  requirements  and supplementary  measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe public will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power sector. Since \n37. \nthe  poor  are  the  first  to  be  cut  off  from  supply  during  winter  power  shortages,  system  loss \nreduction  and  stronger  supply  reliability  will  particularly  benefit  the  poor and  socially  excluded. \nDuring power cuts, the poor are disproportionally affected as they must rely on more expensive \nnonelectric energy sources. \n \n38. \nThe  project  does  not  entail  impacts  on  affordability  or  operational  employment \nopportunities.  During  construction,  the  turnkey  contractor  will  be  required  to  ensure  equal \nopportunities  for  all  social  groups,  equal  pay  for  equal  work  regardless  of  gender,  and \nprohibition of child labor. The contractor will also be required to undertake HIV/AIDS awareness \nactivities with imported workers. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n39. \nThe  project  is  classified  environment  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), was prepared and the final version was disclosed on 14 May 2012 in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s public disclosure requirements. Public consultation was carried out and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthe  records  have  been  included  in  the  IEE.  The  PIU  and  the  implementation  consultant  will \nupdate the IEE based on the detailed design by the turnkey contractor. \n \n40. \nThe main environmental impacts of the project include (i) occupational health and safety \nat  the  project  site,  (ii)  management  of  the  used  oil  and  grease  wastes,  (iii)  disposal  of  scrap \nmetal  and  other  solid  waste,  and  (iv)  proper  handing  and  monitoring  of  circuit  breakers.  The \nEMP specifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. \n \n41. \nThe  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation,  with  assistance  from  the \nimplementation  consultant  and  environmental  specialists  from  EPP.  Environmental  monitoring \nwill  be  performed  by  the  implementation  consultant.  Monitoring  results  will  be  included  in  the \nproject quarterly progress reports and semiannual environmental reports. \n \nThe cost for implementing the EMP will be covered by the loan and the grant. The costs \n42. \nof  mitigation measures will  be  included  in  the turnkey  contract,  and the cost for  environmental \nmonitoring will be included in the consulting services of the project implementation consultant. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \n43. \npeoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project investment will be implemented \nin  the  existing  Toktogul  HEPP  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  not \nenvisaged.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  peoples  as \ndefined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n44.   Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The overall assessment \nis that risks have been identified and mitigated and that the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic does not \nimplement tariff reforms. \nCAPS ceases to operate and export markets \ncollapse. \n\nFailure of dams on the Naryn cascade \n\nProcurement delays and poor implementation \nquality due to weak project management capacity  \nRehabilitation measures of Toktogul HEPP are \ninsufficient. \n\nRetail and wholesale metering projects are delayed \nor cancelled. \n\nReduction in commercial losses does not occur \nand distribution of sector revenues remains \narbitrary and nontransparent. \nWeak internal financial control of open joint-stock \ncompany Electric Power Plants. \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \nPublic acceptance of tariff reforms increases after \nthe public information program is implemented. \nRegional cooperation and trade is supported by the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. \nDam integrity assessed by dam safety assessment \nstudy and priority remedial measures are identified \nand addressed. \nInternational consulting firm is recruited to assist in \nproject implementation. \nDue diligence on identifying priority measures has \nbeen conducted. \nWholesale metering project is being implemented \nunder ADB loan.
