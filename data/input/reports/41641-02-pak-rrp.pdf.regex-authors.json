I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Punjab  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Program. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Punjab is the most populous province of Pakistan (with 56% of the total population), \nwith the largest provincial economic base in the country (accounting for more than 50% of \nPakistan's gross domestic product). Yet its social indicators lag behind those of the other South \nAsian  countries.  This  is  particularly  true  for  two  important  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs), which Punjab will not be able to achieve by the targeted date of 2015 without wide-\nranging reforms in health service delivery and significant improvements in health care financing: \nMDG4, reducing the infant mortality rate (IMR), and MDG5, reducing the maternal mortality ratio \n(MMR). For instance, per capita public health spending in 2009 in Punjab was about $6.4, in \ncontrast to the levels in 2004 of $18.1 in Bangladesh, $18.6 in Nepal and $74.1 in Sri Lanka. \nSuch a situation has serious implications, given Punjab's importance to the country's economy. \nRecognizing the challenges, the Punjab government has attached top priority to the attainment \nof these two MDGs, and sought assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to address \nthe critical fiscal and health sector constraints standing in the way. \n \n3.  In response, during 2007-2008, ADB and the Punjab government together formulated \nthe  program  cluster  comprising  three  subprograms.1 The  program  cluster  aims  to  improve \naccess, quality, and equity of health services in the province, especially in relation to MDGs 4 \nand 5. It will also more broadly ensure adequate health care for the poor by improving the \navailability and quality of primary and secondary health services, and developing a viable pro-\npoor health care financing system. In addition, it will strengthen the management structure of \nhealth service delivery. \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 had several noteworthy achievements, including (i) creation of essential \nmaternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) posts; (ii) recruitment of additional female health \nworkers; (iii) mapping of private practitioners; (iv) strengthening of health information systems; \nand (v) merging of budget and development wings of the Punjab Health Department. By setting \nminimum service delivery standards (MSDS) in 2007, the government clearly shifted its focus \nfrom merely expanding to improving the quality of health services. Critical lessons from the \nimplementation of subprogram 1 include the need for: (i) sustained and results-based interaction \nbetween the Health Department and the districts; and (ii) closer coordination with the provincial \nMNCH program to avoid duplication in the provision of equipment, drugs, and supplies.  \n \n5.  Subprogram 2 continues to focus on MSDS implementation, particularly related to \nMNCH. Also, it seeks to improve day-to-day management of health services by addressing (i) \ncapacity constraints in the health sector, (ii) challenges in recruiting and posting motivated \ndoctors and other professionals in rural and remote areas, (iii) rigid administrative procedures, \n(iv) inefficient and lengthy procurement processes for drugs and medical supplies, and (v) lack \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program \nCluster and Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Millennium Development \nGoals Program. Manila. A loan of $100 million equivalent was provided in a single tranche for Subprogram 1. \n ", "2 \nof performance monitoring. To foster efficiency and accountability in the use of scarce public \nresources, subprogram 2 supports the establishment of provincial and district internal audit \nfunctions, and strengthening of internal controls. It also focuses on developing options for a \nsustainable pro-poor health financing system for Punjab. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1, a list of linked documents analyzing the program is in Appendix 2, and the \ngovernment's development policy letter is in Appendix 3.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the program will be the attainment of MDGs 4 and 5, relating to reducing \nthe IMR and MMR in Punjab. The program's outcome will be improved access to, and quality \nand equity of, health services. The delivery of the minimum package of services described in the \nMSDS, especially for MNCH, is the core strategy for attaining MDGs 4 and 5. Therefore, the \nprogram focuses on reforms required for effective MSDS implementation. The program will \nassist the government in undertaking health sector reforms in three core policy areas (CPAs):  \n(i) improve the availability and quality of primary and secondary health services, (ii) improve the \nmanagement of health service delivery, and (iii) develop a sustainable and pro-poor health care \nfinancing system. A policy matrix for subprogram 2 and tentative policy actions for subprogram \n3 are in Appendix 4. Under each CPA, outcomes and outputs are identified to ensure sustained \nprogress in achieving MDGs 4 and 5. \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  CPA 1: Improve the Availability and Quality of Primary and Secondary \nHealth Services  \na.  MSDS Introduced to Primary and Secondary Health Services \n7.  This policy objective aims to introduce service standards first in the public sector and \nultimately to private sector health service providers. Under subprogram 2, the government has \n(i) completed a wide-ranging information campaign to build awareness of MNCH-related MSDS, \ntargeting general public as well as health workers; (ii) ensured that each district government has \nupdated  its  3-year  rolling  development  plan  previously  adopted  under  subprogram  1  for \nimplementing MNCH-related MSDS; and (iii) ensured that seven district governments have \nsubstantially  conformed  to  the  minimum  level  of  MNCH-related  MSDS.  The  Office  of  the \nDirector General, Health Services (ODGHS) is monitoring implementation of the 3-year plans \nthrough monthly meetings of the executive district officers for health. All 36 districts have signed \na memorandum of understanding with the government to reach the minimum acceptable MSDS \nby 2012.  \n \nb.  Primary and Secondary Health Services Fully Staffed and \nEquipped According to the MSDS \n8.  This policy objective aims to provide adequate physical and human resources to health \nfacilities. Under subprogram 2, the government has placed at least one woman medical officer \n(WMO) or a lady health visitor or a trained midwife in 95% of the basic health units (BHUs), to \nprovide the public with access to competent female staff for MNCH. However, the government \nfaces difficulties in filling all existing vacancies of crucial MNCH-related positions, especially in \nthe specialist categories, where 60% of posts for gynecologists are vacant and 48% of posts for \nanesthetists. A major reason for these high vacancy rates is the availability of attractive pay \npackages in the private sector and internationally. WMOs are crucial for delivering MNCH-\n ", "3 \nrelated services, especially primary health care. Only 54% of WMO posts are currently filled in \nPunjab. The situation is comparatively better for lady health visitors (92% of positions filled) and \nnurses (75% of positions filled). For medical officers, 71% positions are filled both for primary \nand secondary care facilities.  \n9.  Realizing the gravity of the situation, the government has developed a human resource \nplan to address these issues. It is also pursuing short- to medium-term measures, including ad \nhoc  recruitment  of  specialists  and  nurses,  accelerated  training  courses  especially  for \nanesthetists to bridge the gap, rotation of postgraduate training students from teaching hospitals \nto different districts, regularization of contractual posts (medical officers, WMOs, and nurses), \nage relaxation for hiring medical officers and WMOs, and introduction of evening shifts for \ntraining nurses in some districts to improve the supply situation. The Punjab Public Service \nCommission has recruited 1,200 medical officers (approximately 600 available for public sector \nservice delivery) and 276 WMOs.  \n \n10.  Availability of functional equipment is another essential feature of effective health care \ndelivery.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  equipped  80%  of  BHUs,  rural  health \ncenters, and MNCH-related departments of tehsil and district headquarters hospitals in line with \n95% or more of MSDS requirements. The government has developed and circulated a standard \nMNCH-related equipment list for all health care facilities, and circulated a pro forma to the \ndistricts for tracking the availability and functionality of equipment.  \n \nc.  Measures Adopted to Improve Quality of Health Workers and Their \nPractices \n11.  The quality of health workers is the most critical determinant of the quality of health \nservices, as paramedics, nurses, midwives, and lady health visitors play an important role in \nhealth service delivery. Five paramedical and 30 nursing schools are under the control of the \ndistrict governments in Punjab. Under subprogram 1, a conceptual framework and plans were \ndeveloped for improving facilities at these institutions. Building on this, the government has \naccomplished  the  following  under  subprogram  2:  (i)  improved  facilities  in  three  important \nparamedical schools and 15 nursing schools, through the provision of such items as minor civil \nworks, teaching aids, computers, and books; (ii) trained 90% of the MNCH-related workers in \nthe relevant parts of standard medical protocols, standard operating procedures, and referral \nprotocols; (iii) approved a new service structure for paramedics; and (iv) introduced greater \nclarity and rigor in the profession, by separating the examination of paramedics from the Punjab \nMedical Faculty to the University of Health Sciences, known for its high standards, leaving the \nregulatory function with the former. \n \n12.  Continuous medical education is an important tool to ensure quality of health workers; \nhowever, in Pakistan, neither medical doctors nor paramedics have systematic opportunities or \nincentives to update their knowledge. The government has developed a continuing education \nsystem  for  both  groups  under  subprogram  2,  approved  by  the  chief  minister.  Continuous \nmedical education will be linked to the promotion of medical and paramedical staff in the public \nsector in Punjab in the future, with implementation commencing under subprogram 3.  \n \n13.  A comprehensive health human resources plan has been developed and approved \nunder subprogram 2. The plan addresses both the quality and quantity of health sector human \nresources,  incentives  for  filling  vacancies,  rationalization  of  service  structures,  and \ncomputerized  registration  of  health  workers.  Further,  a  computerized  database  has  been \nestablished with detailed data of all health workers, including designation, place of posting, and \n ", "4 \naddresses of the respective facilities. This will substantially improve the Health Department's \nmapping  of  human  resources,  besides  facilitating  the  process  of  postings,  transfers,  and \npromotions. Detailed information on all health sector staff will decrease the number of ghost \nworkers, thereby increasing efficiency of health sector expenditures. \n \n14.  In Punjab, private health services are not subject to any regulation, which leads to \nwidely varying quality. In some instances, private practices are run without a proper permit or \nregistration. As a result, even identifying where private practitioners exist in Punjab is difficult. \nYet, an estimated 70% of the initial health consultations are reported to take place at private \nfacilities, including dispensaries. To protect citizens from negligence and questionable health \npractices, some regulation and quality oversight of the private sector is necessary. At the same \ntime, private sector participation is vital given the capacity constraints in the public sector. \nBalancing these needs, the government has taken the bold step of introducing a health care \ncommission, which would, inter alia, register private practitioners, license private health care \nfacilities, and provide accreditation and performance audit of both public and private health \nfacilities. The government will retain the role of standard setting. The proposed Health Care \nCommission Act has been presented to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly and \nis likely to be approved as an act under subprogram 3, with an action plan developed for \nframing the required rules, bylaws and regulations.  \n \n2.  CPA 2: Strengthen Management of Health Service Delivery \na.  Improved Management and Performance Monitoring \n15.  Prior to subprogram 1, the role of ODGHS was reviewed from the perspective of the \nneed to strengthen the management of health service delivery; ODGHS was subsequently \nrestructured.  One  of  the  principal  functions  of  ODGHS  is  to  support  district  governments, \nespecially with capacity development needs in planning and financial management. In this \nrespect, the plan of action for district capacity development adopted under subprogram 1 has \nbeen fully implemented under subprogram 2. Specifically, 50% of the district health teams and \nmanagers  have  been  trained  under  subprogram  2.  As  noted  in  para.  7,  ODGHS  is  also \nresponsible for ensuring the quality of the districts' 3-year rolling plans and the consistency of \nthese plans with attaining the MSDS. Underpinning these efforts to monitor MSDS is the district \nhealth  information  system  (DHIS),  which  effectively  consolidates  various  sources  of  data, \nregularizes input, and promotes use of such information for decision-making. The DHIS was \nintroduced in 10 districts in Punjab under subprogram 1. The government has rolled out the \nDHIS to all 36 districts under subprogram 2.  \n \n16.  In  collaboration  with  the  Provincial  Information  and  Analysis  Unit,  the  Health \nDepartment is developing key performance indicators as part of an evaluation system based on \ntransparent  criteria  for  assessing  the  performance  of  executive  district  officers  (EDOs)  for \nhealth, and medical superintendents for district headquarters hospitals and tehsil headquarters \nhospitals. The key performance indicators will provide top management with a tool for holding \nmanagers accountable for the effectiveness of field offices and service delivery outlets. Also, the \ngovernment with the support of ADB has developed a results-based management framework \ncovering eight line departments, including health. The framework will link public investments to \ndevelopment objectives through integration with the medium-term budget framework.  \nb.  Improved Efficiency of Drug and Supply Procurement  \n17.  This policy objective supports the achievement of the MSDS and reduced MMR and \nIMR by improving the procurement and supply system for the health sector to ensure necessary \n ", "5 \ndrugs and supplies are available on a regular basis, thereby eliminating frequent out-of-stock \nsituations. Under subprogram 1, the Health Department reviewed drug, equipment, and supply \nmanagement systems with a view to improving efficiency and transparency. Under subprogram \n2, work has progressed on sector-specific procurement guidelines, and 18 drugs have been \nidentified as tracer drugs. These tracer drugs are tracked on a monthly basis through the DHIS, \nidentifying the incidence and location of stock shortages. Additional monitoring of facilities is \nundertaken by the EDOs, health. While the tracer drug list is sufficient for primary health \nfacilities, it needs to be expanded to reflect needs at secondary facilities. Under subprogram 3, \nthe essential drug list will be rationalized for primary and secondary health facilities, preferably \non the basis of burden of disease patterns within a specific district.  \n \nc.  Alternative  Models  of  Health  Service  Delivery  Examined  and \nInstitutionalized \n18.  Punjab has in the past implemented two models of contracting: with the Punjab Rural \nSupport Program and the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD). In an effort to \ndetermine whether the contracting model produced better health outcomes and led to efficient \nand effective health services in the districts compared with those that did not contract, the \ngovernment has finalized the study design for a third-party evaluation of the Punjab Rural \nSupport Program and NCHD models with inputs from ADB and assistance from the United \nNations' Children's Fund. Based on the evaluation results, where feasible, the government \nintends to move to institutionalizing viable contracting arrangements for the health sector. The \ngovernment has also taken steps to improve efficiency of service delivery through functional \nintegration of health services financed by federal, provincial, and district governments for the \nBHUs.  The  concept  of  functional  integration  was  finalized  under  subprogram  1.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the integration approach was pilot tested in five districts in Punjab and the results \nappear quite promising. This will be rolled out to all districts under subprogram 3.  \n \n3.  CPA 3: Establish a Sustainable Pro-Poor Health Financing Arrangement \na.  Greater  Provision  and  More  Rational  Budget  Allocation  for  the \nHealth  Sector,  especially  for  Primary  and  Secondary  Health \nServices \n19.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  developed  a  medium-term  budget \nframework for the health sector at the provincial level, which also captures local government \nactivities, providing a consolidated approach to the health sector (provincial and district budget). \nIn  this  context,  given  the  large  expenditure  requirements  and  low  levels  of  public  health \nspending, the government has increased the provincial budget for health by 15% in FY2010 \nunder subprogram 2. This will trigger an increase in district budgets and expenditures as well. \n \n20.  Analysis of district expenditure indicates that health services receive only a small \nshare of the district budget and are severely underfinanced. To ensure that district governments \nallocate sufficient funding for MNCH-related MSDS, the conditional grant mechanism is used as \na tool to earmark funds for the health sector. Under subprogram 1, grants were made available \nto all districts in Punjab. Under subprogram 2, those districts showing at least 80% utilization of \ntheir  first  grant  are  eligible  to  receive  the  next  conditional  grant.  The  grants  are  shown \nseparately in the budget and are governed by a memorandum of understanding between the \nprovince  and  district  governments,  stipulating  access  conditions.  Under  subprogram  2, \nperformance criteria have been incorporated in the second and third round of conditional grants \n ", "6 \nto  incentivize  improved  district  performance  toward  achievement  of  MSDS.  A  designated \nsecretariat within ODGHS will monitor district utilization of conditional grants. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 1, conditional grants in the amount of Rs.3.5 billion for pursuing \nMSDS were disbursed. Under subprogram 2, the government has allocated PRs 6.4 Billion ($75 \nmillion) in the current FY2010 budget to be disbursed as conditional grants to those districts \nwho  have  spent  80% of  the  conditional  grants  provided under  subprogram  1.  The  Health \nDepartment works with districts in ensuring they regularly report on the use of the conditional \ngrants.   \n \nb.  Improved Financial Management and Reporting, and Internal \nControls and Audits in the Health Sector \n22.  Good financial management and reporting practices will help ensure effective and \nefficient use of resources to meet the program objective of improved quality and equitable \naccess  to  health  services.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Health  Department  merged  the \nDevelopment Wing and Budget and Accounts Wing into the Financial Management Cell (FMC) \nto serve as the focal point for the Finance Department and the Planning and Development \nDepartment for provincial and district budget preparation, execution, and monitoring. The FMC \nbridges  the  traditional  separation  of  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets,  providing  an \nimproved basis for resource allocation. Under subprogram 2, the budget classification codes \nhave been amended to provide detailed monthly reporting for primary, secondary and tertiary \nhealth  care.2 Under  subprogram  3,  the  Health  Department  will  consolidate  reporting  on \ndevelopment and current expenditures in a manner that clearly sets out information on the \nimplications of ongoing development programs for future recurrent spending. \n \n23.  While increased resources for the health sector in Punjab will help increase quality and \naccess of health services, strong internal controls are vital to ensure that the resources are used \neffectively. Continuing earlier work, the government has taken a range of measures under \nsubprogram 2: (i) clearance of more than 1,200 outstanding audit observations by the Internal \nAudit Wing; (ii) analysis of the effectiveness and adequacy of the present internal controls, and \ndesign of a conceptual framework for their improvement, guided by recent external audit reports \nfor spending units within the Health Department; (iii) filling of the positions of director and deputy \ndirector of the Internal Audit Wing in the Health Department, separating the previously jointly \nadministered  budget  and  internal  audit  wings,  and  setting  the  foundation  for  increased \ntransparency  and  accountability;  (iv)  completion  of  a  fiduciary  risk  assessment,  which  will \nprovide the basis for restructuring the internal control system, and an internal audit plan for \nimplementation under subprogram 3; (v) development of a manual and training material for \ninternal auditors; and (vi) appointment of internal auditors in 10 districts.  \n \nc.  Pro-Poor Health Financing \n24.  The government is committed to increasing health investment and introducing major \nhealth financing reforms that will improve equity in access to health services and reduce the \nhealth expenditure burden. Major financing reforms may take several years to complete. Hence, \nthe government has adopted a two-pronged approach: introducing short-term measures to \nrelieve  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  the  burden  of  significant  health  expenditure,  while \ndeveloping an alternative overall health financing system for the medium to long term. Under \n                                                 \n2  This action supports the use of the accounting module of the World Bank-supported Project for Improved Financial \nReporting and Accounting. \n ", "7 \nsubprogram 2, the government pilot tested in two districts the Sehat Sahulat scheme, a pro-poor \nhealth financing model, which gives pregnant women living below poverty line access to free \nMNCH services through health vouchers. The results were evaluated and presented in a report. \nBased on this, and with a view to providing more institutional autonomy and efficiency, the \ngovernment has rationalized user charges across facilities and according to services provided, \nand developed a mechanism for institutionalizing and retaining user charges for facilities. A \nconceptual framework for reducing health care expenditure burden on the poor was developed \nunder subprogram 1. Building on this, the government has prepared a position paper over the \ncourse of 2009-2010. Based on the realities of Punjab's current health financing system, the \npaper presents various options for pro-poor health-financing: a tax based system, voluntary \nhealth insurance, social health insurance, and community-based insurance. While none of the \noptions would be ideal on a stand alone basis for Punjab, the paper and background reports \ndiscuss the strengths of each and recommend that a combination of two or three of the options \nmay be adopted. The position paper and recommendations have been disseminated within the \nhealth  community.  They  will  be  debated  at  a  round  table  for  major  stakeholders  under \nsubprogram 3. \n   \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n25.  The government has requested ADB for a loan of $150 million for subprogram 2 to \npartially meet the financing needs for health sector reforms. At the time of subprogram 1, the \nfollowing requirements were identified for a 3-year period, which have now been revised (Table \n1):3 \n \nTable 1: Punjab Health Sector Financing Requirements \n \nFinancing Requirements Over 2008\u20132011  $ million \nImplementation of MNCH-related MSDS  82.0\nImplementation of MSDS overall in the health sector  400.0\nProvision of pro-poor health financing  194.0\nScaling up of public health expenditures to raise per capita  929.0\nspending to $16 (about half of the international benchmark set \nby World Health Organization) \nTotal Requirements  1,605.0\nMNCH = maternal, neonatal, and child health; MSDS = minimum service delivery standards. \nSource: ADB staff. \n \n26.  Under  subprogram  1,  out  of  the  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent,  the  government \nallocated PRs3.5 billion ($50 million) as conditional grants to district governments to carry out \nthe reforms associated with the program. Under subprogram 2, the equivalent of $75 million \n(50% of the loan amount) has been allocated for the second round of conditional grants. \n \n27.  The  proposed  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  102,318,000  for \nsubprogram 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have an interest rate of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The \nloan will be released in a single tranche. The borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. \nThe federal government will relend the local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan \nto the Punjab provincial government. The terms and conditions will be the same as those \n                                                 \n3  The provincial government will meet most of the remaining financing requirements, with the federal government \nproviding some support through vertical programs which are implemented throughout the country including Punjab. \n ", "8 \nextended by ADB to the borrower. The specific loan size and composition for subprogram 3 will \nbe  confirmed  during  loan  processing,  on  the  basis  of  reform  progress,  requirements,  and \navailability of resources at that time. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  Subprogram 2 actions have been implemented over January 2009\u2013June 2010. The \nsubprogram 2 will remain open until 30 December 2010 to allow for the audit of the use of the \ncounterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds. The management of subprogram 2 will be \noverseen by the Health Sector Reform Program Steering Committee, comprising the chairman \nof Punjab Planning and Development Board as the chair; and secretaries of health, finance and \nlocal  government  and  community  development  departments  as  members,  along  with \nrepresentatives  of  various  public  and  private  sector  health  care  providers.  The  Health \nDepartment of the Punjab government will function as the executing agency, with Finance \nDepartment  and  the  Planning  and  Development  Department  acting  as  the  implementing \nagencies. The Health Sector Reform Program Management Unit, comprising 22 staff, will be in-\ncharge of the day-to-day implementation of the program.  \n \nF.  Procurement and Disbursement \n28.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries excluding the items \nspecified in a negative list of ineligible items. The list of ineligible items is a linked document \ncited in Appendix 2. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans.4 Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports on the basis of a \ncertificate provided by the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Pakistan, \nminus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under \nother  official  development  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan \nexpected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the government's certification. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The provision of budget support for reforms under the Punjab Millennium Development \nGoals Program is justified on two principal grounds. First, as noted in para. 2, Punjab lags \nconsiderably behind other regions in South Asia. It needs to expand its public spending on \nhealth to catch up with its neighbors. Second, the district and local government interventions \nsupported under the program are better implemented through a programmatic modality, given \nthe reform imperatives to design and deliver basic health services for MNCH. The program \nsupports  inclusive  growth  through  improvements  in  governance  and  service  delivery.  The \nreforms  will  improve  the  availability  of  health  care,  management  of  service  delivery,  and \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  pro-poor  health  financing  arrangements  in  a  manner \nconsistent with fiscal sustainability. The introduction of a medium-term framework for fiscal \nplanning and a framework that consolidates recurrent and development spending objectives for \nthe health sector ensures that increased financing for the health sector focuses on efficient \nspending  and  sustainability.  Conditional  grants  for  districts  not  only  contribute  increased \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2007.

Improvements in financial \nmanagement and internal audit within the provincial and district health services work to support \nefficient use of resources and ensure sustainability of improved allocation for public health \nservices.  \nB.  Governance \n30.  Several governance risks are identified in the areas of public financial management, \nexpenditure planning and control, procurement, and corruption. As a policy and institutional \nreform program, the program deliberately and explicitly puts governance and public expenditure \nmanagement issues at the center of the reform effort. Reforms proposed under the program will \npositively  affect  the  current  institutional  setup  in  the  health  sector  and  address  these \ngovernance  risks,  although  the  change  in  public  financial  management  practices  and  the \nemphasis on results-based allocation of resources may encounter internal resistance to change. \nThe program has built-in third-party assessments, including a citizen satisfaction survey. ADB's \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment of Pakistan and the Health Department, Government of Punjab.  \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The majority of maternal and infant deaths in Punjab are preventable if women and \nchildren have timely access to quality preventive, primary, and secondary health care. Access is \nlimited or delayed because health services are not physically available locally, doctors and/or \nmedicines are not available, or services are unaffordable. Where health care services are \navailable, their quality is not always optimal. Punjab\u2019s health service delivery system needs \nquantitative and qualitative improvements, and measures to reduce the burden of health care \nexpenditure on the poor. Poor people have the worst health outcomes and they are pushed \nfurther into poverty because of ill health, resulting in lower productivity or loss of daily wages, \nand a burden of high health care expenditures. Although public health care is in principle free, \npatients often have to pay substantial amounts for health care because of missing drugs and \nsupplies at public health facilities. Approximately 75% of health expenditure is estimated to be \nfinanced through out-of-pocket expenditures in Punjab. Until 2 years ago, the majority of the \nhealth care budget of the government went to tertiary health care, which mainly serves the \nurban population and whose benefits are known to be regressively distributed.  \n32.  Improved access and quality for primary and secondary health care supports a reduction \nin IMR and MMR consistent with the attainment of MDG targets by 2015. By that time, the \nprogram will have contributed to saving the lives of more than 11,000 women and more than \n235,000 infants. By assisting the government in implementing the MSDS, the program will \nensure that the MSDS are observed and ultimately enforced throughout Punjab. The program \nwill also improve the capacity of the Health Department and district governments in human \nresource management, and will support improved and ongoing training for all levels of medical \nstaff. By ensuring primary and secondary health services meet the MSDS, the program will have \na positive impact on MDG6, through inclusion of HIV prevention measures in the MSDS. \nD.  Safeguards \n33.

They have also agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for subprogram 2, including those on policy actions and their continuation, \npolicy dialogue, use of counterpart funds and program implementation as described in detail in \nthe loan and program agreements. \n \nV.
