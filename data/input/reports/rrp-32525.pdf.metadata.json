The  port  facilities  are  the  country\u2019s  strategic\nassets.  The  Project  will  establish  Suva  Port  as  a  lifeline  facility\ncomplying  with  the  minimum  seismic  design  standard,  and\nreducing  the  environmental  impact  of  the  transport  system  by\nimproving intermodal allocation of cargo volumes between land\nand maritime sectors.\n\nThe  Project  through  its  Suva  Port  component  will  increase  the\ncapacity  of  the  existing  port  facilities  and  enable  them  to  cope\nwith  the  anticipated  throughput  and  vessel  traffic  for  an\nadditional  15  years.  The  primary  benefit  is  the  additional  15\nyears of use from the existing port facility. Through its Lautoka\nPort  component,  the  Project  induces  trade  and  the  related\nemployment. The primary benefit is the facilitation of significant\ntrade growth.\n\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  wharf  infrastructure  to  allow\nmore efficient use of modern technology in cargo operations. It\nwill expand the capacity of the container yard both in Suva and\nLautoka.  The  related  benefits,  namely  (i)  improved  vessel\nturnaround  time,  (ii)  enhanced  cargo  handling  productivity,  and\n(iii)  increased  frequency  and  competitiveness  of  vessel  calls,\naccrue  directly  to  the  port  users,  involving  both  importers  and\nexporters.\n\nincome \n\nIncreasing  trade  opportunities  will  become  available  for  Fiji\nthrough  expanded  facilities  in  Lautoka  with  growth  inducing\nemployment, \nimpacts,  and  export  earnings.  The\nconsumers  will  also  benefit  from  the  (i)  lowered  cost  of  freight\nper volume of cargo due to improved port operations and sector\nreforms; and (ii) reduced negative environmental impacts, road\nsafety  impacts,  and  noise  as  a  result  of  less  heavy  container\ntraffic on the main road system.\n\n\fiv\n\n\f1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe  Maritime  and  Ports  Authority  of  Fiji  (MPAF),  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji\nIslands, for the Fiji Ports Development Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nKing\u2019s Wharf at Suva Port was constructed in 1963. The first loan of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to the port sector, approved in September 1979,1 was to this port and was evaluated\nand rated as generally successful.2 Under this project, the Port was rehabilitated and developed for\ncontainerized  cargo.  Twenty  years  later\u2014at  the  end  of  the  expected  life  of  the  rehabilitation\u2014and\ndespite a regular maintenance program, Suva Port is degenerating with (i) an aged wharf apron with\na reduced structural capacity to handle the current cargo requirements, (ii) an aged wharf structure\nand its landfill reclamation at below minimum seismic standards, and (iii) insufficient storage space\nfor containers. Corrosion is significant and will severely affect the expected life of the port facility in\nthe next few years.3\n\n3.\nThe Lautoka Port was constructed in 1961 and is the second largest port of Fiji and a relief\nport  to  Suva.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  port  was  carried  out  under  a  loan  from  the\nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) in 1992. In light of forecast increases in demand for port services\nin the area, extension of the port\u2019s berth and storage space is necessary to facilitate trade.\n\n4.\nReconnaissance for the Project was carried out in November 1998, fact-finding in January\n1999,  and  appraisal  in  May  1999.  These  missions  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  the  King\u2019s  Wharf\nRehabilitation Project. Accordingly, management review and staff review committee meetings were\nconducted on 22 March and 27 May 1999. As a result of the political events in Fiji since May 2000,\nthe  Project  has  awaited  the  government\u2019s  guarantee  for  the  Loan.  In  this  period,  additional\nrequirements  have  emerged  at  the  Lautoka  Port.  As  requested  by  the  Borrower  and  the\nGovernment,  a  project-specific  consultation  mission4  in  June  2001  appraised  these  requirements\nand  this  report  incorporates  an  expansion  component  for  the  Lautoka  Port.  The  new  project\ncomponent  together  with  the  inflation  incurred  in  construction  prices  led  to  a  2.4-fold  increase  in\nthe project cost since the prior appraisal, and a doubling of the ADB loan amount since the 1999\nappraisal.  The  report  is  based  on  findings  of  the  ADB  consultation  mission,  a  review  of  the\nfeasibility reports, visits to the project sites, and discussions with relevant officials. The loan is the\nfourteenth loan to the Fiji Islands and the second in its port sector. The project framework is given\nin Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe  Fiji  Islands  comprise  330  islands  with  a  total  land  area  of  18,272  square  kilometers\n5.\n(km2).  Most  of  the  population  (94  percent)  live  on  the  two  largest  islands,  Viti  Levu  and  Vanua\nLevu,  which  account  for  87  percent  of  the  land  area.  Fiji\u2019s  current  population  is  839,106,  and  is\nexpected  to  reach  951,760  in  2010.  The  Suva  urban  area  accounts  for  about  30  percent  of  the\npopulation. Suva is the principal commercial and service center, and the seat of the Government. It\nis also an education center, and a regional hub with numerous regional institutions and embassies.\n\n                                                \n1 Loan 0411-FIJ: Suva Port, for US$7.0 million, approved on 20 September 1979.\n2 PPAR: PEO 0258: Suva Port, September 1988.\n3 Suva Port Master Development Plan, Final Report, 1996.\n4 The Mission comprised S. Jarvenpaa, Sr. Project Economist and Mission Leader; I. Bone, Engineer-Consultant; and D.\n\nHopkins, Engineer-Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\n6.\nThe Government maintained macroeconomic stability over a five-year period marked by the\nAsian  economic  crises  and,  more  recently,  a  period  of  political  instability,  and  the  falling  world\nprices  of  primary  products.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  at  current  factor  costs  grew  by  1.4\npercent  in  1998  and  by  8.0  percent  in  the  subsequent  year,  and  reached  F$3,092  million\n(US$1,345 million), or F$3,766 per capita in 1999. However, in May 2000, parliamentary members\nwere  taken  hostage  by  an  armed  group  of  civilians,  the  government  resigned,  and  an  interim\ncaretaker  administration  was  formed.  National  elections  were  conducted  in  August  2001  and  a\ncabinet  formed  in  September  2001.  These  events  adversely  affected  the  economy,  and  GDP\ncontracted by about 8.2 percent in the year 2000. The first half of 2001 has seen a partial recovery\nwith  GDP  now  forecast  to  grow  by  1  percent  for  the  year,  revised  downward  from  an  earlier\nforecast of 4.8 percent.\n\n7.\nThe  economy  of  Fiji  Islands  is  open  and  driven  by  exports,  with  its  main  markets  in\nAustralia, United Kingdom, and United States. Exports of goods and services correspond to about\n70  percent  of  GDP,  while  imports  of  goods  and  services  equal  about  50  percent  of  GDP.  Sugar\nand  garments  continue  to  dominate  commodity  exports,  although  receipts  from  both  industries\nhave  declined  in  the  last  year.  A  number  of  garment  factory  closures  since  mid-2000  indicate  a\nlikely continuation of a downward trend in the textile, clothing, and footwear industry. World prices\nfor gold and copra, Fiji Islands\u2019 two primary product exports, have also declined and both volume\nproduction  and  receipts  are  down  in  recent  years.  However,  strong  growth  in  fresh  fish  exports,\ngood  performance  from  timber  and  nonsugar  agricultural  production,  and  newly  emerging  export\nproducts such as bottled water are helping to offset the decline in traditional exports.\n\n8.\nImports  comprise  manufactured  goods;  machinery  and  transport  equipment;  food;  minerals\nand fuels; and chemicals from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. While the trade\nbalance has been negative, the services\u2019 exports, primarily travel and transport, brought the current\naccount into surplus  for 1996 and 1997, although this declined to near balance in 1998 and 1999.\nForeign reserves have been maintained and were equivalent to 5.2 months of imports at the end of\nApril 2001 and compare well with the high level of 5.8 months of imports in the previous year. In the\n1990s,  the  Government  has  curtailed  its  external  borrowing  over  the  past  four  years.  Total  debt\ndeclined  from  1992-1996;  the  public  outstanding  debt  remaining  stable  at  F$200  million;  and  the\nprivate sector debt decreased through to 1997, and thereafter more than doubled by 1999. From\n1997 to 1999, the Government\u2019s external debt service ratio maintained a level of between 2 and 3\npercent of GDP. The total external debt rose from a low point of 11.3 percent of GDP in 1997 to 15.9\npercent in 2000. While relatively low compared with other developing countries, this marks a change\nfrom the falling trend over the previous five years.\n\n9.\nIn an effort to restore competitiveness in the aftermath of the Asian crises, the Reserve Bank\ndevalued the Fiji dollar by 20 percent in January 1998. Inflation reached 8.1 percent in 1998, but\nfell  during  1999.  Following  the  political  events  in  mid-2000,  prices  experienced  a  short  period  of\ndeflation. Influenced, in part, by high petroleum prices that have increased by 5 percent, inflation\nhas remained at a moderate 2 percent.\n\n10.\nThe  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  objectives  are  to  maintain  low  inflation  and  external\nstability,  and  to  restore  private  investor  confidence.  Over  the  year  to  March  2001,  Government\nrevenue  declined  by  19.2  percent  while  expenditure  increased  by  9.5  percent.  Although\nexpenditure  was  held  to  20  percent  below  forecast,  the  Government  nevertheless  recorded  a\ndeficit of 3.8 percent of GDP to March 2001. In the short term, until the political situation stabilizes,\nthe current stagnation of economic activity appears likely to continue.\n\n 11.\nThe economy is characterized by a duality between an agricultural and subsistence farming\npopulation,  and  an  urban  and  employed  population.  The  pattern  of  income  inequality  reflects  an\n\n\f3\n\nuneven distribution of economic activity by geographic area. Accordingly, the national poverty line\ndefined  in  1997  in  the  Suva  capital  area  (F$100  per  week)  is  higher  than  that  in  the  nonurban\nareas  (F$83  per  week).  Twenty-five  percent  of  the  total  population  is  estimated  to  live  below  the\npoverty  line.  As  a  result  of  the  1998  drought  and  subsequent  floods,  another  25  percent  were\nexpected to fall below the poverty line. The poorest and the richest 20 percent of households are\nestimated  to  account  for  5  and  50  percent  of  the  GDP,  respectively.5  The  Government  pledges\nparamount attention to improve the condition of the poor, and targets reduction of the cost of living,\nimproved  access  to  health  services  by  all,  employment  generation,  and  rationalization  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s privatization program to achieve this goal.\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n12.\nTransport  is  well  developed  and  multimodal,  consisting  of  road,  maritime,  rail,  and  air\ntransport. The gateway international airport is at Nadi, with regional air traffic handled by the Nausori\nairport  near  Suva.  Domestic  aviation  infrastructure  includes  22  airports.  The  two  main  islands,  Viti\nLevu and Vanua Levu, contain 90 percent of the country\u2019s road network of 5,206 kilometers (kms).\n\n13.\nIncome inequality in the country is primarily related to the remoteness of the disadvantaged\npopulation  centers.  Developments  in  the  transport  sector  are  reducing  isolation  and  improving  the\ntransition from subsistence farming\u2014characteristic livelihood of households below the poverty line\u2014\nto cash crop farming and marketing. This is currently realized under the Government\u2019s Third Road\nUpgrading  Program,  funded  by  an  ADB  loan.6  Similarly,  the  ADB-supported  franchise  scheme  for\ninterisland  shipping,  implemented  in  1998,  has  helped  to  ensure  more  affordable  transport  to  the\nisolated outer islands.7\n\n14.\nThe  country  is  well  served  by  international  and  regional  shipping.  There  are  a  total  of  26\npublic  ports  including  wharves  and  jetties.  In  2000,  the  three  main  ports,  Suva,  Lautoka,  and\nLevuka, received a total of 940 port calls and handled a total of 2.5 million gross revenue tons with\n56  percent  being  imports.  This  consists  of  1.6  million  tons  of  bulk  cargo  and  34,656  containers\ncarrying 854,635 tons of cargo. Since 1999, a slight decline of throughput of about 1 percent has\nbeen attributed to the politically unstable situation in Fiji since May 2000. Suva Port handles half of\nthis cargo and 69 percent of the port calls, 89 percent of the total containerized traffic, 63 percent\nof the import cargo, and 32 percent of the exports.\n\n15.\nThroughput  in  Suva  has  been  reduced  by  1.5  percent  since  1999  as  the  gross  national\nproduct declined consequent to the political events in 2000. Lautoka Port predominantly facilitates\nbulk exports of raw sugar, molasses, and pine chips. It receives about one-fourth (26 percent) of\nthe port calls, but handles about half of the total cargo throughput, 36 percent of the imports, and\n68 percent of the exports, mainly break-bulk cargo. Recently, Lautoka has had increased demand\nfor the port facilities for transport of bottled water through to Suva and to the United States. This is\nexpected  to  add  100  full  container  loads  per  week,  more  than  doubling  Lautoka  Port\u2019s  container\ntraffic.  Also,  further  increase  is  expected  from  the  export  of  grass  to  the  Arab  Emirates  in  2001.\nLevuka Port receives 5 percent of the port calls as it services Fiji\u2019s tuna cannery. It handled 7,333\ntons  of  cargo  in  2000,  having  experienced  a  47  percent  decline  in  the  tuna  cargo  throughput.\nMalau  Port  facilitates  the  adjacent  sugar  and  wood-chip  exports,  and  petroleum  imports  for  local\ndistribution on Vanua Levu. In January 2001, Malau Port was declared an entry port with customs\nand immigration facilities to handle international cargo. A number of private wharves and jetties are\noperated by industries such as the Fiji Sugar Corporation.\n\n                                                \n5 Government of the Republic of Fiji Islands, United Nations Development Programme. 1997.

It  particularly  emphasizes  the  need  to  improve  efficiency  and  productivity  of  the  port\noperations  by  increasing  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  commercializing  services,  maintaining  high\nsafety  levels,  and  ensuring  intermodal  coordination.  The  Government\u2019s  aim  is  to  ensure  future\ncompetitive  and  lower  cost  port  services,  and  provide  adequate  capacity  to  meet  the  anticipated\ntraffic and cargo growth.\n\n17.\nMPAF manages port infrastructure within the four major ports. Its fourth corporate plan (fiscal\nyear  [FY]  2000-2001)  defines  its  vision,  mission,  corporate  objectives  and  strategies,  and  financial\noutlook. The MPAF is a landlord and a regulatory authority with responsibilities for the management,\nadministration, and development of the declared entry ports of Suva, Lautoka, Levuka, and Malau.\nMPAF\u2019s statement of corporate intent for FY2001 focuses on its performance forecast and identifies\nthe need for (i) rehabilitation of the King\u2019s Wharf with seismic upgrading and deck strengthening in\n2001, (ii) completion of the bi-annual dredging at the Princes and Walu-bay wharves, (iii) reclamation\nwork and wharf extension at Lautoka Port, (iv) commencement of international operations at Malau\nPort in Vanua Levu, (v) acquisition of two tug boats, (vi) implementation of a simplified port tariff, and\n(vii) introduction of a marine environmental (pollution) control levy.\n\n18.\nMPAF is also pursuing its long-term goals of becoming a Pacific hub port, developing free-\nport  facilities,  and  creating  greater  transshipment  capacity.  Its  infrastructure  development  plan8\noutlines  MPAF\u2019s  infrastructure  development  needs  and  was  recently  reconfirmed  by  an  evaluation\nreport commissioned by the Ministry of National Planning.9 As a long-term plan, these plans propose\nan eventual replacement of Suva Port by a multipurpose cargo facility at Rokobili, a site 5 km from\nthe  current  Suva  Port  location.  However,  a  geotechnical  analysis in  199810  concluded  that  the  soil\nsediments  in  the  Rokobili  lagoon  were  soft.  This  made  the  new  facility  uneconomical,  and\nconsequently, the Project was postponed to 2015.\n\nIn the interim and in the absence of the port relocation project, the master plan demonstrates\n19.\na need for repairs and rehabilitation of Suva Port to extend its life to 2020. The rehabilitation is also\nneeded to improve competitiveness of the port and its ability to cope with the anticipated throughput.\nIt will establish King\u2019s Wharf as a lifeline wharf as warranted by the seismic risk in the area.\n\n20.\nExtension of facilities at Lautoka Port will increase capacity for cargo storage and handling by\n(i) allowing additional berthage of long distance vessels to north America and Asia, (ii) increasing port\nproductivity between the Suva and Lautoka ports, (iii) improving intermodal interfacing between the\nland and maritime transport, (iv) reducing road deterioration, and (v) supporting tourism by enabling\ndevelopment  of  attractive  berthing  possibilities  for  small-  and  large-scale  cruise  vessels.  Together\nwith  greater  flexibility  in  vessel  scheduling,  the  proposed  Project  in  Lautoka  will  catalyze  long-term\nbenefits  from  local  export  industries  and  from  international  cargo  vessels  as  it  will  enable  these  to\ninclude Lautoka as a single point of call in Fiji.\n\n                                                \n8  MPAF. 1996.

These  have  been  amended  to  reflect  the  port  sector  reorganization  (para.  22).\nUntil late 1997, the sector was managed by two institutions, the Marine Department of Ministry of\nCommunications, Works and Energy (MCWE) and the Ports Authority of Fiji (PAF). Since then, far-\nreaching  reforms  have  been  implemented  under  the  Government\u2019s  public  enterprise  reform.  The\nobjectives of these are to (i) allow government entities to operate on a commercial basis and in a\ncompetitive  environment;  and  (ii)  make  the  government  entities  more  efficient,  productive,\naccountable, and better organized. The Public Enterprise Act took effect in 1996 and established a\nlegal  framework  and  mechanism  for  the  reorganization  of  Government  entities.  It  provides  for  the\nadoption of reorganization charters and the appointment of interim boards, and sets forth the legal\nframework  for  the  establishment  of  Government  commercial  companies  and  commercial  statutory\nauthorities (CSAs).\n\nb. \n\nMaritime Sector Agencies Prior to Reorganization\n\nPAF, established in 1975 pursuant to the PAF Act,11 was under the overall supervision and\n22.\ncontrol  of  MCWE  and  was  responsible  for  the  regulation  and  operation  of  the  three  ports  at  Suva,\nLautoka, and Levuka. The functions of PAF were to (i) provide and maintain adequate and efficient\nport services, and facilities in ports and the approaches to ports; (ii) regulate and control navigation\nthe  approaches  to  ports;  (iii) promote  the  use,  improvement,  and  development  of  ports;  (iv)\ncoordinate  all  activities  within  the  ports;  (v)  acquire  land  and  execute  works  as  necessary  for  the\nfunctioning  of  the  ports;  and  (vi)  take  necessary  action  related  to  the  performance  of  its  functions.\nPAF had the authority to enter into contracts; sue and be sued; acquire, hold, and dispose of land;\nand act as necessary to perform its functions. PAF could, with the consent of MCWE and the minister\nof finance, borrow and raise international loans. In fact, PAF borrowed from ADB in 1979 (footnote 1)\nand from the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 1992 and 1995. The assets of PAF were evaluated\nat US$25.7 million (F$59 million) in 1997.\n\nThe  activities  of  the  Marine  Department  of  MCWE  were  diverse:  its  Marine  Fleet  Section\n23.\nowns  a  fleet  of  vessels,  which  included  cargo/passenger  crafts,  landing  crafts,  navigational  aids,\nhydrographic  vessels,  and  other  crafts;  its  Statutory  Shipping  Office  enforces  maritime  laws  and\nensured  that  hull,  machinery,  life-saving,  and  fire-fighting  surveys  were  carried  out  by  qualified\nsurveyors; and it ran an apprentice scheme and a program for maintenance of navigational aids, and\nconducted hydrographic surveys.\n\nc. \n\nMaritime Sector Reorganization\n\nThe  PAF  Reorganization  Charter12  was  adopted  in  October  1997  in  accordance  with  the\n24.\nPublic  Enterprise  Act  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Industry,  Cooperatives  and  Public  Enterprise\n(MCICPE). The aim was to reorganize PAF and restructure it as a corporation (e.g., \u201ccorporatize\u201d it);\nincrease its operational efficiency; and operate it as a successful commercial business. To achieve\nthis, the reorganization comprises three phases constituting the sector reform program:\n\n                                                \n11 Act No. 20 of 1975.\n12 PAF Reorganization Charter of 15 October 1997, under the Public Enterprise Act of 1996.\n\n\f6\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nincorporation of Ports Terminal Limited (PTL) under the Companies Act of 1983 as a\nGovernment  commercial  company  to  undertake  stevedoring  and  cargo  handling,\nstorage, and pilotage;\nestablishment  of  MPAF  as  a  CSA  to  regulate  and  supervise  all  maritime  activities\nwithin ports and Fiji waters, and to undertake port asset management, maritime sector\nregulation, and policy formulation currently performed by the Marine Department; and\nfurther  reform  of  MPAF  to  separate  asset  management  functions  from  sector\nregulation.\n\nd. \n\nImplementation of Reorganization\n\n25.\nPTL  was  incorporated  under  the  Company  Law  and  declared  a  Government  commercial\ncompany in December 1997. This implemented the first component of the reform. US$1.17 million\n(F$2.7  million)  of  PAF\u2019s  assets  were  transferred  to  PTL.  In  accordance  with  its  Articles  of\nAssociation, PTL is a private company limited by shares and managed by its directors. The shares\nare  held  in  trust  by  the  State.  The  directors  exercise  all  powers  of  PTL,  including  the  power  to\nborrow  money.  PTL  undertakes  cargo  handling  and  storage  services  under  a  five-year\nnonexclusive license agreement with MPAF, for which it is expected to pay MPAF an annual rental\nof US$0.17 million (F$0.4 million).  PTL is subject to the direction of the port master within MPAF\nregarding  the  use  of  its  equipment.  While  PTL  is  responsible  for  the  wharf  cleaning,  MPAF\nmaintains  its  infrastructure.  The  objective  of  establishing  PTL  as  a  commercial  cargo  handling\ncompany was to facilitate commercialization and privatization of port operations, and to enable PTL\nto compete with privately owned business with comparable functions. PTL is expected to adopt (i)\na  customer-focused  and  business-oriented  structure;  (ii)  a  private  sector  philosophy  for  its\norganization,  conditions,  patterns,  attitudes,  and  ethics;  and  (iii)  a  tariff  structure  to  enhance\nefficiency and productivity.\n\n26.\nTo  carry  out  its  services,  PTL  has  a  permanent  staff  of  99  including  33  stevedores.  It\ncontracts  additional  labor  from  private  sector  firms,  as  needed.  PTL\u2019s  employees  are  currently\nengaged  for  three  years  under  contracts  that  have  replaced  the  past  civil  service  contracts  with\nunion-negotiated  salary  increases,  but  include  no  incentives  for  wet-weather  work  or  performance\nreward. In the process of transferring from the civil service contracts, PTL confronted labor action that\nwas resolved in a judicial process in favor of PTL. PTL collects charges under the regulations within\nthe PAF Act. These include charges for cargo handling, storage, equipment rental, and a piloting fee.\nThe organization chart of PTL is in Appendix 2.\n\nMPAF was declared a CSA in December 1997. This implemented the second component of\n27.\nthe reform. Effectively, MPAF began operating on 1 March 1998, when PAF assets were segregated\nto  MPAF  and  PTL.  MPAF  was  established  to  undertake  (i)  port  asset  management,  (ii)  ports  and\nmaritime regulation and licensing within ports, (iii) port state control, and (iv) maritime regulation and\npolicy formulation of the Marine Department. Currently, MPAF manages port assets and implements\nregulations  established  for  the  maritime  activities  within  the  Fiji  ports  and  waters.  Revenues  of\nMPAF  included  dues  for  wharfage,  dockage,  and  mooring;  revenues  from  piloting  services;  the\nenvironmental fee, and a share of the towage charge. MPAF was authorized to collect navigation\naids'  dues  when  these  were  incorporated  into  its  responsibilities. To  carry  out  its  responsibilities,\nMPAF had 54 staff. MPAF\u2019s organization chart is in Appendix 3.\n\n28.\nMPAF became the legal successor of PAF. The revised PAF Act specifies that any reference\nto  PAF  in  any  contract,  instrument,  register,  document,  or  court  proceedings  is  to  be  read  and\nconstrued  as  a  reference  to  MPAF.  Thus,  MPAF  assumed  all  liabilities  of  PAF.  The  borrowing\npowers of PAF remained unchanged with MPAF. Under the Finance Act, any Government guarantee\nof loans to MPAF is subject to parliament approval.\n\n\f7\n\nIn April 1998, MCICPE declared the Marine Department a \u201creorganization enterprise\u201d. The\n29.\ncorresponding \u201creorganization charter\u201d was adopted by MCICPE in November 1998. In accordance\nwith  this  charter,  the  functions  of  the  Marine  Department  relating  to  aids  to  navigation,  port  state\ncontrol, and hydrographic charting were to be transferred to MPAF. The charter also renames the\nMarine Department as the Fiji Maritime Policy Unit. This unit and the Marine Board would take over\nthe regulatory functions of the Marine Department as listed in the amended Marine Act.13 Under the\nReorganization  Charter,  the  Government\u2019s  vessel  fleet  was  established  as  the  Shipping\nCorporation of Fiji, Ltd. Under this reorganization, MCWE would continue to supervise both the Fiji\nMarine Policy Unit and MPAF. In November 1999, the name of the Marine Department was changed\nto the Fiji Islands Maritime Safety Administration (FIMSA).\n\ne. \n\nFurther Reform Proposals\n\n30.\nDuring  the  last  two  years,  political  events  in  the  country  and  the  significant  changes  in  the\ncomposition  of  the  cabinet  have  affected  implementation  of  the  reform  process.  The  Government\nwas  not  able  to  pursue  implementation,  and  MPAF  only  nominally  absorbed  the  port  state  control,\nand  has  yet  to  incorporate  staff  for  the  operation  of  the  aids  to  navigation  and  the  hydrographic\nresponsibilities. The PTL did not establish commercial operations and was not sold to private sector\nas intended.\n\n31.\nA  Cabinet  decision  in  October  2000,  however,  established  MPAF,  PTL,  and  FIMSA  as\nreorganization enterprises. The Ministry of Public Enterprises established a task force to study further\nreform and performance improvement in the maritime sector. In May 2001, an interim final report of\nthis  study  was  circulated  within  the  Government  for  comments.  It  focused  on  restructuring  the\nactivities  of  MPAF  and  PTL  into  a  port  company  that  would  manage,  promote,  and  develop  port\nresources to facilitate trade through the ports of Suva and Lautoka and provide cargo management\nand  handling  services,  pilotage,  berthing,  stevedoring,  and  other  port  services  at  these  ports.  The\ncompany  would  provide  these  services  by  licensing  private  operators.  The  port  company  would\ndispose of its non-port assets (a headquarters building and an on-shore container yard); reallocate\nport state control, navigation aids, and hydrographic services to FIMSA; and be required to provide a\n15 percent return on equity (ROE) to the Government. A four-fold increase in the current port tariff\nwould be required for MPAF to generate the required ROE. FIMSA would be responsible for sector\nregulation and PTL would cease to exist. Neither PTL operations nor performance are analyzed in\nthe  report.  The  organizational  structure  of  the  port  company  would  remain  largely  unchanged  from\nthe  current  MPAF  structure  with  the  scope  of  operation  reduced  to  only  two  ports  in  place  of  four.\nFIMSA,  inheriting  all  noncommercial  operations  of  MPAF  and  PTL,  would  need  considerable\ncapacity building.\n\n3.\n\nSuva Port\n\n32.\nSuva  Port  is  the  main  port  for  international  trade.  It  is  also  a  focal  point  for  outer  island\ndomestic  services,  and  a  base  for  fishing  and  ship  repair  industries.  In  2000,  1.2  million  tons  of\nrevenue cargo, 940 ship calls, and 32,706 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU)14 containers were handled\nby the port. Cargo volumes for Suva declined as a result of the GDP reduction.\n\n33.\nSuva Port throughput is expected to reach 50,000 TEUs by 2011. Under conservative growth\nscenarios, bulk cargo volumes will double by 2025. Suva Port handles 69 percent of all ship calls.\nWhile  the  ship  calls  to  Suva  have grown  only  by  an  average  annual  rate  of  1.3  percent  during\n\n                                                \n13 The Marine Act of 1986 was amended to reflect the sector restructuring in 1999.\n14 TEU is the international standard measure for a standard 20-foot-long container.\n\n\f8\n\n1992\u20131997, import and export revenue tons have increased by an annual average of 8 percent in\nthe  same  period.  Imported  and  exported  containers  have  increased  annually  by  7 percent.  Since\n2000,  the  cargo  volumes  were  affected  by  the  political  situation  in  Fiji,  and  in  particular  the\nconsequent reduction in GDP by 8 percent in 2000. Cargo volumes lag behind the general growth\ntrend. As a result of the economic slow down, consumer spending waned, and demand for imports\nfrom  the  export  industries  slowed.  The  impact  on  employment  have  also  affected  consumer\nconfidence and spending on imports. As the economy is currently returning to a sustainable level\nof  growth  of  about  4  percent  per  annum,  and  investor  confidence  grows,  demand  for  cargo  is\nexpected  to  return  to  the  normal  level.  As  a  result,  containerized  cargo  volumes  were  severely\naffected in 2000, and are expected to recover by the end of 2003 to the 1997 levels. Low and high\nscenarios  for  cargo  volume  growth  have  been  developed  based  on  historical  GDP  and  import  and\nexport  growth.  These  yield  a  low-case  annual  growth  rate  of  2.8  percent.  Under  this  scenario,  the\nrevenue  tons  handled  by  Suva  Port  would  double  by  2011,  when  the  capacity  of  Suva  Port  with\nbenefits of the Project will be saturated.\n\n34.\nSuva Port comprises the King\u2019s Wharf complex, Muaiwalu fishing wharf complex, Narain jetty,\nand Rokobili terminal. The King\u2019s Wharf complex consists of three linked quay structures of Princes\nWharf  (152  m),  Walu  Bay  Wharf  (183  m),  and  King\u2019s  Wharf.  The  King\u2019s  Wharf  comprises  three\nberths (north, south, and central) with a total length of 492 m and a depth of 12 m. The capacity of\nthe present facilities at Suva Port is restricted as a result of the geotechnical and structural conditions\nof King's Wharf. While Suva Port has a natural harbor, the wharf has been built on a geotechnically\ndifficult site on the edge of an extensive reclamation. The wharf structure is supported by cylindrical,\nlong,  hollow,  pre-stressed  concrete  piles.  At  the  north  berth,  the  piles  are  solidly  founded  on  the\nbedrock  and  act  as  well-performing  rearing  piles  with  an  ultimate  design  capacity  of  150  tons.\nThose  in  the  south  end  are  friction  piles  and  do  not  reach  the  bedrock  at  60  m.  The  concrete\nstructure  has  deteriorated  due  to  corrosion  of  its  reinforcement  steel.  The  current  capacity  of  the\nstructure is only about half of its original design (70 tons). The edge of the reclamation is supported\nby  a  retaining  wall  which  can  support  only  limited  loads.  Because  the  wharf  is  connected  to  the\nreclamation retaining wall by bridges, failure of the reclamation wall would also cause the wharf to\nfail.  Any  seismic  safety  consideration,  thus,  must  include  the  entire  soil  and  structure  system.\nFurthermore, the wharf deck is deteriorating, and its concrete has cracked and delaminated.\n\nSuva  is  within  a  seismic  fault.  Earthquakes  caused  damage  in  the  country  in  1850,  1902,\n35.\n1919, 1932 (twice), 1953, and 1979. The reactivation of the faults within the bedrock and slumping of\nthe  overlying  sediments  were  partially  responsible  for  the  1953  earthquake  and  tsunami.  This\nearthquake caused serious damage to the wharf that preceded King\u2019s Wharf, and the magnitude has\nbeen  assessed  to  have  a  return  period  of  50  years.  Seismological  evidence  also  suggests  that  a\ngroup of faults in the area running northwest is currently active. Earthquakes capable of damaging\nKing\u2019s Wharf, along with other structures in Suva, may occur in the near future.15 A seismic stability\nassessment16 of the reclamation at King\u2019s Wharf concluded that safety is unacceptably low during a\nprobable seismic event.17\n\n36.\nThe  layout  of  Suva  Port  is  shown  in  Appendix  4.  King\u2019s  Wharf  is  a  multipurpose  cargo\nhandling site. While  containers  dominate cargo operations, unitized, wheeled, break-bulk, dry bulk,\nand  liquid  bulk  are  also  handled.  Containerization  of  cargo  has  increased  during  the  past  two\ndecades. The container yard is shallow from the wharf face to the rear fence, which separates the\n\n                                                \n15 Minor earthquakes have recently occurred affecting the southern and northern islands of Fiji, the latest measuring 5.6\n\non the Richter scale.\n\n16 Shorten,  G.  1993.

Prior to May\n2000,  the  container  yard  of  1.95  hectares  (ha)  was  under  pressure  from  the  container  volumes.  It\nwas  designed  for  536  containers.18  Containers  are  stacked  parallel  to  the  wharf.  The  yard  was\ngenerally more than half full, and when it became two-thirds full, the containers were stacked three\nhigh. Effective policing and high demurrage charges have reduced dwell times for containers in the\nyard to three days, which compares well with international standards. The international standard for\nland utilization ranges from an annual 0.5 to 3.5 TEU per square meter (m2). In 1999, the annual land\nutilization  of  2.28  TEU/m2  reflected  efficient  use  of  the  current  space.  In  light  of  the  cargo  volume\nforecast,  this  efficiency  standard  can  be  maintained  only  through  an  increase  in  the  area  of  the\ncontainer yard. With the current area, the total yard capacity of about 50,000 TEU per annum will be\nreached by 2011.\n\n37.\nThe  current  cargo  handling  operation  is  inefficient.  In  the  absence  of  shore-based  cranes,\nSuva Port cannot handle ships that lack lifting gear. The insufficient wharf strength prohibits the use\nof  forklift  trucks  to  lift  full  containers  on  the  wharf  apron;  instead  the  ships\u2019  gear  is  used  to  lift  the\ncontainers  onto  trailers.  The  trailers  are  stacked  in  bays  designated  by  shipping  agency.  Empty\ncontainers  are  also  moved  to  stacks  at  shipping  agency  bays.  The  cargo  handling  productivity  at\nSuva Port was 5.23 containers per vessel-hour prior to the sector reorganization in 1998 (paras. 57-\n61).  Thanks  to  the  focus  on  cargo-handling  efficiency  under  the  reorganization,  this  has  since\nimproved to 8.00 containers per hour per vessel using the ships\u2019 lifting gear. Pre-1989 New Zealand\ncargo handling performance of 15 containers per hour using ships\u2019 gear gives a regional comparison\nand a target. International vessels calling at Suva Port can be divided into two categories: (i) those\ncalling  on  their  route  from  the  Americas  and  Asia  to  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  (ii)  Pacific\nregional traffic. While the regional traffic must maintain ships\u2019 gear to load and unload at the Pacific\nports  other  than  Suva,  the  long-range  traffic  needs  to  maintain  the  ship\u2019s  gear  only  for  the  call  at\nSuva  Port.  This  requirement  restricts  long  range  calls  to  a  confined  number  and  type  of  vessels\nwithin  the  fleets  of  the  shipping  lines.  Equipping  vessels  with  cranes  is  expensive,  and  displaces\nvaluable space and load capacity.\n\n38.\nContainer  loading  and  unloading  at  Suva  Port  concurrently  with  cargo  delivery  is  also\ninefficient.  While  the  state  of  cargo  handling  equipment  is  poor,  two  additional  forklift  trucks  were\nrecently purchased that are capable of carrying both 40 and 20 foot containers. The container yard is\na  common  use  area  allowing  the  consignees  to  collect  cargo.  Ship  loading  and  unloading  thus\noccurs  simultaneously  with  deliveries  of  cargo  to  consignees,  resulting  in  vehicles  having  to\nmaneuver within the small yard. The forecasted increase in cargo will lead to three-container stacks.\nSubsequently,  two  container  moves  will  be  needed  to  reach  containers  at  the  bottom  of  the  stack.\nFurther,  containers  are  stacked  without  regard  to  berthing  allocations.  Combined,  these  conditions\nreduce efficiency of the container handling and, consequently, competitiveness of the port.\n\n39.\nCargo  handling  operations  affect  vessel  productivity,  which  increases  freight  costs  to  the\neconomy. Low productivity and particularly low consistency in productivity can lead to less frequent\nvessel visits to a port. The shipping industry tends to schedule port calls with increasing precision.\nThe  need  to  use  only  the  few  vessels  equipped  with  cranes  for  calls  to  Fiji  restricts  flexibility  and\naffects  the  frequency  of  visiting  vessels.    This  also  increases  freight  rates.  The  reliability  of  cargo\nhandling  at  Suva  Port  has  improved  lately  but  is  still  too  low.  With  general  upward  pressure  on\nprices, the low cargo handling productivity induces vessel operators to increase rates to Suva. With\nproductivity  improvement,  some  vessels  could  fit  an  additional  port  call  into  the  Pacific  route  or\nassign more frequent service to Suva. This would improve the cost-efficiency of the vessels and lead\nto more competitive freight rates.\n\n                                                \n18 The  design  standards  of  United  Nations  Conference  Trade  Assistance  Development  are  generally  conservative.\n\nDuring peak demand 700 containers have been fitted onto the yard.\n\n\f10\n\n4.\n\nLautoka Port\n\n40.\nLautoka  Port  is  the  country\u2019s  main  bulk  port  handling  most  of  the  raw  sugar,  molasses,\nwood  chip,  fertilizer,  and  timber  exports.  It  is  on  the  northwestern  coast  of  Viti  Levu.  The  port\nserves as a vital link for regional shipping and Suva, and is a hub for the tourist cruise industry. It\nhosts about six international cruise vessels per year, the largest of which require the use of both\nQueen's  Wharf  and  the  sugar  and  wood-chip  loading  berths.  In  2000,  1.2  million  cargo  revenue\ntons,  248  ship  calls,  and  4,467  20-foot  TEU  containers  (footnote  14)  were  handled  by  the  port.\nLautoka Port handles 25 percent of all foreign ship calls to the country\u2019s ports and 26 percent of all\nship  calls.  The  political  events  of  May  2000  affected  cargo  volumes  of  Suva  Port  more  than  at\nLautoka,  which  relies  on  domestic  bulk  exports  for  its  primary  business.  However,  because  of\ntextile factory closures and declining textile exports, the throughput at the Lautoka Port is expected\nto decline to 1.02 million tons in 2001.\n\n41.\nOverseas  ship  calls  to  Lautoka,  excluding  oil  tankers,  fell  by  an  average  annual  rate  of  8\npercent  during  1992-1997,  and  have  remained  stable  at  an  average  of  150  calls  per  year  from\n1998  to  2000.  Import  revenue  tons  remained  constant  between  1992  and  1999  at  an  average  of\n550,000  tons,  while  exports  increased  by  7  percent  annually  between  1992  and  1996  to  reach  a\nhigh  point  of  105,000  tons.  Exports  subsequently  dropped  sharply  to  38,000  tons  by  1999.\nImported containers increased from 3,200 TEU in 1992 to 4,800 TEU in 1995 and then declined to\n3,300 TEU in 2000. Export containers similarly grew from 1,100 in 1993 to 1,800 in 1996 and then\ndeclined  to  940  in  2000.  The  decline  in  cargo  in  recent  years  reflects  a  combination  of  shipping\nrationalization  through  Suva,  reduced  sugar  exports  in  response  to  a  declining  price,  periods  of\ndrought,  and  some  downturn  in  the  garment  industry.  However,  this  situation  is  set  to  change\nradically  with  the  introduction  of  two  high  volume  export  industries  in  north  Viti  Levu.  A  major\nincrease in demand for port services in Lautoka is forecast to derive from new exports of mineral\nwater and animal feed. These industries forecast export growth that will double the cargo and ship\ncalls at Lautoka Port once adequate facilities have been completed, and to reach 4.7 million tons of\ncargo  and  446  ship  calls  in  2003.  Container  volumes  from  the  new  trade  are  projected  to  rise  to\nover 100,000 TEUs by December 2002.\n\nLautoka  Port  is  also  seen  as  a  relief  port  for  Suva.  It  is  strategically  located  in  vicinity  of\n42.\nindustry  and  agricultural  production  sites.  It  is  envisaged  to  contribute  to  improvement  of  the\nintermodal  interphasing  between  the  two  ports  and  to  reduction  in  demand  for  road  transport  by\ncontainer traffic. The Land Transport Authority of Fiji will gradually enforce the maximum allowed\naxle-weight of 11 tons per 10-wheel truck with full enforcement from 2003. This will increase land\ntransport costs and place additional demand for international cargo volumes to depart directly from\nLautoka.  The  Queen\u2019s  Road  from  Lautoka  to  Suva  has  deteriorated  due  to  containerized  transit\ntraffic  and  sugarcane  loads.  The  road  is  currently  the  primary  road  in  the  country,  and  has\ngradually declining safety and environmental conditions.\n\n43.\nLautoka is protected from ocean swells by its fringing reefs, and Queen's Wharf draws shelter\nfrom  Vio  Island  to  the  west,  Bekana  Island  to  the  north,  and  Covuli  Reef  to  the  northwest.  The\ncurrent Queen's Wharf at Lautoka Port was constructed in 1962. The four-sided island wharf is a\nconcrete  structure  140  m  long  and  80  m  wide.  The  north-south  oriented  structure  provides  one\nmain cargo berth to the west, for vessels with a draught of up to 10.5 m, and berths to the east for\nsmaller  vessels  with  a  draught  of  7  m.  The  wharf  has  a  roll-on-roll-off  (RORO)  facility  and  can\nsustain  fully  laden  forklift  trucks  with  a  maximum  axle  load  of  95  tons.  Elsewhere,  the  wharf  is\ncapable of supporting a 25 ton load, which allows operation of un-laden 25 ton forklift trucks, and\ntractor-trailers.  Due  to  the  constrained  draught,  international  vessels  use  only  the  western  berth.\nMost  of  the  vessels  calling  at  Lautoka  exceed  167  m  and  as  a  result  overhang  the  berth.  While\n\n\f11\n\nonly  few  incidences  of  conflict  at  the  berth  have  been  recorded  annually,  the  berth  availability\ndeters vessel traffic from calling at Lautoka. The layout of Lautoka Port is shown in Appendix 5.\n\n44.\nPresently,  the  main  west  berth  provides  a  single  berth  for  cruise  liners,  RORO  and  other\ncargo  vessels.  The  north  quay  has  mixed  use  by  tugboats,  large  island  cruise  boats,  and\ninterisland cargo coasters and barges. The east quay is used by island cruise boats and the south\nquay is used for cargo coasters and naval patrol boats.\n\n45.\nQueen's  Wharf  was  built  to  handle  general  cargo  and  is  not  capable  of  taking  container\nloads.  The  spalled  and  cracked  concrete  of  the  wharf  was  repaired  in  1965.  In  1984,  severe\ndamage  resulting  from  containerization  of  the  cargo,  corrosion  of  the  reinforcement,  and  further\ndamage to the concrete structures from humidity and maritime conditions were identified. In 1992,\nthe  concrete  deck  structure  was  treated  for  corrosion  under  an  EIB  loan.  Pile  caps  were  rebuilt,\nfenders  were  upgraded;  and  auxiliary  services,  lighting,  and  other  utilities  were  replaced  and\nupgraded.  Degradation  of  the  wharf  brought  the  original  load  capacity  to  13.5  tons.  The  seismic\nstrength  of  the  wharf  was  improved  to  two-thirds  of  the  standard  required  by  modern  structural\ncodes. Since then, cracking and corrosion have occurred in parts of the repaired wharf. The wharf\nload capacity is not adequate for storing containers. The present container storage is limited to 35\nTEUs in the area surrounding Shed 3. In 1999, with an average of 60 full container loads per week\nshipped to this area, it has become congested, particularly immediately prior to vessel arrival. The\nproximity of other operations and access to the wharf and shed compounds this problem.\n\n46.\nThe wharf is connected to the shore by a 34 m access bridge, which provides direct access\nfrom storage areas to Queen's Wharf. This bridge has similar limited load capacity and condition to\nthose of the wharf. An access road to the south and extensive tidal flats to the north border the port.\nA  large  transit  shed  in  the  middle  of  the  wharf  is  used  for  storage,  container  packing,  and  office\nspace. The port includes three storage sheds of 6,030 m2 and privately owned terminals facilitating\nsugar, molasses, wood chip, gas, and petroleum shipment.\n\n47.\nSeparate bulk loading facilities cater especially for the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) and for\nthe wood chip exports of Tropik Woods, and are privately owned and operated. A 1 ha reclamation\nsouth of the Queen\u2019s Road houses a transit shed of 800 m2 and is used for general and container\nstorage providing 35 TEU ground slots. In 1991, a 1.6 ha reclamation area north of Queen\u2019s Road\nwas constructed and is occupied by oil storage tanks under a long-term lease. The port has retained\ncontrol of the seaward end of this area as a barge berth with the remainder serving as a customs\nstorage yard and a car park. In 1993, a general upgrading of the facilities for cargo and passengers\nwas  completed.  In  light  of  large  increases  in  demand  for  storage  space,  MPAF  has  commenced\nfurther  reclamation  of  6,500  m2  south  of  the  access  bridge.  This  will  provide  for  124  additional\ncontainer ground slots with three-high stacking capability, giving 372 TEU spaces.\n\nCargo handling operations are inefficient at Lautoka Port. The containers are brought from\n48.\nthe  container  stacks  by  tractor  trailers  over  the  access  bridge,  which  is  concurrently  used  by\npedestrians and other traffic. The containers are lifted using ship\u2019s cranes. Queen\u2019s Wharf deck is\nnot  capable  of  carrying  laden  forklift  trucks  so  containers  must  remain  on  the  tractor  trailers  until\nloaded onto the ship. Any delays to loading have a direct effect on the throughput of subsequent\ncontainers.  In  the  southwest  corner,  a  small  section  of  deck  has  been  strengthened  with  a  350\nmillimeter  concrete  overlay.  This  allows  forklift  trucks  to  handle  containers  from  RORO  vessels.\nLautoka Port suffers from poor cargo handling. The new facilities envisaged under the Project, the\nwharf  extension  and  additional  container  storage  area,  require  significant  improvement  in  cargo\nhandling.\n\n\f12\n\n49.\nThe  earthquake  hazard  in  Fiji  Islands  has  been  scientifically  assessed,  and  seismic  design\nstandards  set  according  to  the  expected  level  of  earthquake  ground  tremor.  A  catalogue  of  3,200\nshallow  earthquakes  between  1850  and  1990  formed  the  basis  of  the  assessment.  The  largest\nknown earthquake in Fiji Islands had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale. Lautoka Port is in a\nsimilar seismic hazard zone to Suva.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n50.\nThe  port  sector  benefited  from  an  ADB  loan  of  US$7.0  million  in  1979  (footnote  1),  to\nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  Suva  Port.  EIB  approved  an  E6.0  million  loan  in  1992  for  rehabilitating\nand upgrading  Lautoka Port and a loan of E0.4 million in 1995 for preparing the Suva Port Master\nDevelopment  Plan.  In  addition  to  these,  MPAF  and  its  predecessor  have  financed  their  activities\nwith short-term borrowings from domestic commercial sources. In 2000, Singaporean Government\ngranted technical assistance for a technical study on the port developments in Fiji. The conclusions\nof the study align with this report.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB\u2019s  Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings  in  the  Ports  and  Shipping  Sector19  concluded\n51.\nthat  the  majority  of  ADB\u2019s  port  projects  led  to  improvements  in  port  operations  and  to  lower  cargo\nhandling  costs.  According  to  the  synthesis,  growth  projections  of  some  projects  did  not  materialize\ndue  to  general  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  lead  time  needed  to  attract  new  traffic.  Port\nentities were found to be well organized and exceeding their financial projections. Commercialization\nand  expansion  of  the  port  entities\u2019  autonomy  from  the  governments  was  implemented  as  planned.\nInstitutional  weaknesses  pointed  to  management  information  systems  and  the  need  to  modernize\nand  upgrade  staff  skills.  The  synthesis  found  that  ADB\u2019s  port  projects  experienced  construction\ndelays due to design and scope modifications, site conditions, and shortage of local funds. Financial\nand  economic  returns  to  ADB  port  projects  were  lower  than  expected  due  to  increases  in  project\ncosts,  low  increases  in  tariffs,  and  delayed  benefits  as  a  result  of  delayed  construction.  Social\nimpacts of ADB\u2019s port projects were found to be positive.\n\n52.\nThe ADB-assisted Suva Port Development Project experienced significant cost increases as\na  result  of  high  inflation  and  progressive  devaluation  of  the  Fiji  dollar.20  This  complicated  contract\nnegotiations  and  delayed  implementation  of  works.  Works  were  also  disrupted  due  to  a  technical\ndispute  between  the  supervisor  and  the  contractor  over  the  impact  of  the  rock-fill  on  the  steel  pile\nstructures.  Consequently,  the  less  destabilizing  construction  methodology  of  slab-over-pile  design\nwas  adopted.  Delays  were  also  caused  by  the  soil  conditions,  and  selection  of  the  contractor  and\nconsultants.  The  effective  delay  in  project  implementation  amounted  to  12  months.  The  project\ncompletion report considers the performance of PAF, a relatively young executing agency, creditable.\nPAF  complied  with  all  the  loan  covenants  satisfactorily.  The  project  successfully  attained  its\nobjectives: improvement in the port operations and increased traffic to Suva Port.\n\n53.\nThese  problem  areas  can  be  addressed  under  the  proposed  Project.  MPAF  will  call  for\nexpressions  of  interest  for  the  design  and  supervision  contract  for  the  proposed  Project  during  the\nfourth  quarter  of  2001.  MPAF  will  furnish  the  outline  terms  of  reference  to  ADB  for  its  approval.\nDesigns  exist  for  the  Lautoka  component.  Adequate  provision  for  physical  contingencies  has  been\nallowed  to  accommodate  changes  that  could  realistically  arise  from  detailed  design.

It  has  engaged  various  consultant  teams  to  support  its\nplanning, reorganization, technical, and financial reforms. MPAF is operating as a financially solvent\nand independent entity. While financial management of MPAF is sound, a plan will be prepared with\nADB technical assistance (TA)21 for improving port asset management, operational, and commercial\nperformance of MPAF (para. 71).\n\nE.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n55.\nADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium supports reform in areas of economic policy,\npublic  sector  management,  poverty,  governance,  and  private  sector  development.  It  addresses\nresults-oriented  management  of  government  systems  and  organizations,  processes  to  emphasize\nperformance,  and  improvement  in  service  delivery.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Fiji  Islands  continues  to\nsupport  the  transport,  urban,  and  tourism  sectors  with  a  focus  on  poverty  reduction.  These\ninterventions  aim  to  improve  industry-wide  resource  allocation,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  that\ncontribute to economy development. Greater emphasis is placed on institutional issues under sector-\nbased  lending  that  reduce  constraints;  the  proposed  Project  addresses  transport  sector\u2019s  ability  to\ncontribute to growth, trade, and competitiveness.\n\n56.\nThe  Project  targets  improvement  in  the  capacity  of  the  country\u2019s  primary  port  infrastructure\nand port management system. It aims to focus port activities toward trade facilitation and releasing\nthe  potential  growth  of  export  sectors.  It  further  targets  increase  in  the  competitiveness  of  the  two\nmain  ports  in  Suva  and  Lautoka  by  enhancing  productivity  and  the  quality  of  the  port  services,\nleading to reduction in transport and handling costs of imports and exports. The Project, additionally,\ntargets establishment of a lifeline and a relief port system in the country to ensure supply of goods at\ntimes of national disasters.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nPolicy  dialogue  undertaken  during  project  processing  is  reflected  in  the  output-based  and\n57.\ntime-bound policy matrix in Appendix 6. This focuses on targeted achievement of improvements in\nthe  use  of  the  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  facilities  under  the  Project  and  facilitates  monitoring\nachievement  of  these  objectives  with  target  dates  and  benefits.  ADB  has  contributed  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s  sector  agenda  with  a  multipronged  policy  dialogue  and  has  sharpened  the  focus\nunder sector issues. This policy dialogue has been designed to support sector reforms as well as\nto  strengthen \nthe  operational  and  commercial  management  of  MPAF.  The  port  sector\nreorganization  and  preparation  of  environmental  legislation  have  been  supported  through  past\nADB  TA.22  Associated  with  the  proposed  Project,  ADB-funded  TA  for  Port  Asset  Management\nImprovement  (footnote  21)  will  support  the  establishment  of  realistic  options  for  operational  and\norganizational improvement of the sector (para. 71).\n\n1.\n\nFurther Sector Reform\n\n58.\nTrade  facilitation  relies  on  effective  logistics  that  enhance  exporting  and  importing.  The\nexistence  of  supportive  logistics  is  a  key  to  attracting  investments  and  trade.  In  addition  to  trade\n                                                \n21 TA 3199-FIJ: Port Asset Management Improvement, for US$150,000, approved in 31 May 1999.\n22 TA 3155-FIJ: Strengthening the Public Enterprise Reform Program (Phase I), for US$150,000, approved on 5 January\n1999,  and  TA  2180-FIJ:  Environmental Awareness, Legislation, and Database, for  US$450,000,  approved  on  13\nOctober 1994.\n\n\f14\n\npolicy,  such  logistic  include  port  infrastructure,  port  and  cargo  management,  and  intermodal\nlinkages with land transport systems. The Fiji Islands\u2019 existing port facilities and operations are not\n(i)  sufficient  to  meet  the  current  cargo  throughput  in  the  medium  term,  (ii)  adequate  to  facilitate\nlong-term  growth  in  cargo  volumes,  or  (iii)  able  to  support  Fiji  Islands\u2019  trade  policy  efficiently\nsupporting trade.  Thus, cargo management and port infrastructure must be improved.\n\n2.\n\nManagement of Cargo Handling\n\n59.\nThe maritime  sector reform program needs to focus on the management of cargo handling\noperations. Current operations constrain the use of the existing infrastructure under the Project. Most\npressingly, no competition is present in the current cargo handling operation, which is managed by a\nGovernment-owned commercial company. Furthermore, cargo handling is constrained by insufficient\nequipment,  staff  incentives  and  training,  coordination  with  the  port  facilities.  Cargo  handling  at  the\nport  could  be  improved  immediately  by  introducing  competition  and  thus  establishing  a  market  for\ncargo handling service delivery.\n\nSuva Port is challenged with poor cargo handling. The self-servicing vessel cranes handle\n60.\nan average of eight containers per vessel hour (ranging from 4 to 13 containers per vessel hour).\nThis can be compared with regional equivalents of 15 containers per hour using ships\u2019 gear, which\nis  a  reasonable  target  for  the  Suva  Port  operations  and  for  cargo  handling  operations  in  the  Fiji\nIslands. The cost of poor performance in cargo handling services is borne by the Fijian consumers.\nShipping agents currently charge, on behalf of the vessel operators, an additional US$73 (F$150)\nper  TEU  container  due  to  the  slow  cargo  handling.  This  charge  recovers  the  vessel  operators\u2019\nadditional costs incurred due to the slow cargo handling. This costs Fiji Islands\u2019 consumers US$2.4\nmillion  (F$5.5  million)  per  annum.  Foregone  cargo  flows,  additional  costs  of  bulk  cargo,  and\nforegone opportunities for improved shipping services to Fiji and the related savings have not been\nincluded in this estimate.\n\nPTL,  a  Government  commercial  company,  provides  cargo  handling  and  storage  services\n61.\nunder a five-year nonexclusive license agreement with MPAF, which expires in February 2003. The\nfunctions of PTL are to undertake (i) stevedoring and cargo handling at Suva and Lautoka ports, (ii)\npilotage  in  designated  ports  and  on  coastal  routes,  (iii)  all  aspects  of  warehousing  in  Suva  and\nLautoka  ports,  and  (iv) management  of  local  wharves  in  Suva  and  Lautoka.  PTL\u2019s  objective  is  to\nprovide safe and cost effective port terminal services to enhance competitiveness, maximize returns\nto shareholders, and promote development of its employees. PTL has total assets of US$2.7 million\n(F$6.3  million),  in  2001,  32  percent  of  which  is  funded  from  borrowings,  18  percent  from  retained\nearnings,  and  the  balance  (50  percent)  from  the  owner\u2019s  capital.  Currently,  PTL  generates  about\nUS$3.7  million  (F$8.6  million)  in  gross  revenues,  which  yields  a  gross  margin  of  about  US$0.17\nmillion  (F$0.4  million),  or  a  6.3  percent  return  on  assets  and  12.6  percent  on  owner\u2019s  capital.  The\nprofit margin is forecast to decline during 2002 to 2007 due to the expected increases particularly in\npersonnel and vehicle expenses. No additional capital investments are planned.\n\n62.\nIn  1998,  PTL  committed  to  target  a  change  in  culture  and  business  focus,  increased\nefficiency  and  productivity,  provision  of  a  shareholder  return,  and  efficient  management  of  its\ncommunity service obligations by 2001. In the long term, PTL planned to develop its core business\n(container  handling),  improve  specialist  handling  facilities,  attract  more  transshipment  cargo,  and\nreduce the cost of cargo handling by 15 percent by 2003. For achieving its performance measures\u2014\nearnings before interest and tax and a return on invested capital\u2014the board of PTL is accountable\nto  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises.  Under  the  PAF  Reorganization  Charter,  market  pressure  on\nPTL's services is to be introduced by privatizing PTL and awarding of additional operating licenses\nfor  cargo  handling.  This  charter  provided  that  the  Government  should  have  sold  its  PTL  shares  to\nPTL  employees  and  its  strategic  partners  within  three  years  of  PTL  commencing  operation,  i.e.,\n\n\f15\n\nMarch 2001. Competitors were to be licensed to operate during 1999. Due to the political instability,\nthese reforms and improvements were not implemented.\n\n63.\nCargo  handling  performance  is  also  affected  by  constraints  in  storage  and  container  yard\nspace;  equipment;  labor  productivity;  coordination  and  allocation  of  berthing  space;  and\ncommunications  among  the  cargo  handling  operation,  the  port,  and  the  shipping  agents.\nImprovements  are  required  in  each  of  these  areas  and  competition  is  essential  to  improving  the\ncargo  handling  operations.  In  late  1999,  MPAF  confirmed  the  interest  of  the  private  sector  in\nparticipating  in  the  cargo  handling  operations  in  Suva  and  Lautoka  ports.  This  must  now  be\nreconfirmed,  and  subsequently,  an  additional  nonexclusive  license  for  cargo  handling  operation\ntendered  to  the  private  sector.  Cargo  handling  providers  from  the  private  sector  are  expected  to\ngive competitively priced services and to achieve this through training, productivity incentives, and\nprovision of appropriate equipment. Introduction of competition to cargo handling is a condition to\ndisbursement of loan proceeds under the project (para. 139).\n\n64.\nThe  move  to  privatize  cargo  handling  is  consistent  with  PTL\u2019s  reorientation  into  a\ncommercial operation. PTL\u2019s noncargo handling task would, consequently, be given to MPAF and\nFIMSA, in accordance with the legal mandates of these organizations.\n\n3.\n\nSector Regulation\n\nKey  features  in  the  public  sector  reform  have  been  commercialization,  and  separation  of\n65.\nregulatory from operational functions. The Government has endeavoured to focus on (i) regulating\nthe economic sectors, with the objective of enhancing competition, and (ii) developing the private\nsector,  to  create  employment  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Marine  Act  and  the  PAF  Act  have  been\namended to reflect the port sector reorganization. The PAF Reorganization Charter (1997) and that\nof the Marine Department (1998) were adopted with an outline for sector reform. The Government\nhas  completed  the  first  two  components  of  the  sector  restructuring:  (i)  incorporation  of  a\ncommercial cargo handling company under the Company Act, and (ii) establishment of MPAF as a\nGovernment CSA. Separation of the landlord functions of MPAF from its regulatory functions was\nexpected under this Reorganization Charter.\n\n66.\nThe  cabinet,  in  October  2000,  declared  FIMSA,  MPAF,  and  PTL  as  Reorganization\nEnterprises  with  the  objective  to  establish  commercial  port  operations  and  a  governmental\nregulatory function vested in FIMSA. This provides the necessary opportunity to focus on efficiency\nimprovements at the port and, in particular, on management of cargo handling operations. With an\naward  of  additional  cargo-handling  licenses,  competition  and  appropriate  incentives  for  effective\ncargo handling will be introduced as a first step under the reform program. MPAF will award two or\nmore stevedoring licenses no later than by February 2003 at the expiry of the PTL\u2019s contract and\nwill conduct the due tender process prior to that date (para. 139).\n\nPTL  needs  to  be  able  to  relinquish  its  noncargo  handling  activities  of  warehousing  and\n67.\nmanagement of local wharves in Suva and Lautoka. Piloting services at Suva Port are provided by\nPTL  and  a  private  pilot.  PTL\u2019s  piloting  license  is  part  of  the  cargo  handling  license  and  should  be\nseparated and tendered to private sector operators by MPAF. Warehouse leasing is a responsibility\nof the landlord port, and the management of the local wharves is a function of the Ministry of Tourism\nand Transport (MOTT)\u2014the successor of MWCE, which remains responsible for outerisland wharves\nand  jetties.  In  carrying  out  this  responsibility,  MOTT  may  seek  to  contract  this  function  to  capable\nparties.\n\n\f16\n\n4.\n\nPort Infrastructure\n\n68.\nIntroduction of market forces to cargo handling services requires concurrent improvements\nto the port infrastructure. These include identification of additional space for container storage and\nhandling. Space for container and cargo storage at Suva Port will be increased by the Project, as\ntwo  sheds  currently  occupying  5,930  m2  will  be  demolished.  This  will  result  in  126  additional\ncontainer  slots,  which  could  accommodate  378  container  spaces,  or  a  71  percent  increase.\nProvision of the additional space will be complemented by civil works to improve maneuverability\nand  will  include  regrading  pavements,  rearranging  light  towers,  providing  new  light  towers,  and\nreinstating  pavement.  Additional  space  for  about  300  containers,  or  56  percent  on  the  original\ncapacity  of  the  yard,  can  be  gained  from  realigning  the  containers  to  support  efficient  cargo\nmanagement.\n\n69.\nStrengthening  of  the  wharf  deck  is  planned  under  the  Project.  This  will  allow  operation  of\nfully laden 25 ton forklift trucks along the central and northern berths. The strengthening will also\nallow placing laden containers on the wharf for faster stacking, and operation of mobile cranes on\nthe  apron,  once  their  procurement  becomes  viable.  The  strengthening  and  additional  space  will\nhelp improve cargo management efficiency, port productivity, and vessel turn-around time.\n\n5.\n\nPort Operations\n\n70.\nPort operations can be enhanced through (i) improved and consultative yard planning; (ii)\neffective and purposeful space management, i.e. placing loaded rather than empty containers near\nthe loading vessel and separating outgoing from incoming loads; (iii) improved traffic routing; and\n(iv) separation of cargo handling from freight handling by haulers. Berth allocation, a responsibility\nof  MPAF,  additionally  requires  computerization  and  coordination  with  the  cargo  handling\noperations,  the  licensed  companies,  and  the  ship  agents.  Port  traffic  should  be  controlled  and\ncirculation improved to support maximum port efficiency. Additionally, activities requiring re-routing\nof  haulers  such  as  management  of  payments  for  port  services  require  relocation  to  improve\ntrafficability of the port area.\n\nThe TA (footnote 21) for port asset management improvement will (i) examine operational\n71.\nmanagement  of  port  assets  and  operations,  (ii)  delineate  regulatory  functions  and  noncore\noperations  of  PTL  and  MPAF,  (iii)  outline  a  program  for  improvement  in  the  commercial  and\noperational performance of MPAF, and (iv) recommend a fully integrated management information\nsystem for MPAF. MOTT will be the Executing Agency for the TA.\n\n6.\n\nEnvironmental Management\n\nEnvironmental management of Suva Port has significantly improved over the last two years.\n72.\nWhile the Fiji Maritime Policy Unit is responsible for implementation of national conventions in the\nsector  such  as  the  International  Convention  for  the  Prevention  of  Pollution  from  Ships  (MARPOL\n73/78), 23 MPAF has enhanced its capability to comply with the Clean Port Management Policy of\nthis convention. It has also added two people to the staff of the Occupational Health, Safety and\nTower Control Section, bringing the total staff to 10. This has enabled MPAF to carry out 24-hour\nport  surveillance.  It  is  also  establishing  quick  response  teams  with  equipment  and  personnel\ntrained  to  handle  accidents  in  the  port  area.  To  finance  the  recurrent  costs  of  such  operation,\nMPAF has introduced an environmental charge on vessel calls. The Sydney Ports Corporation has\n\n                                                \n23 MARPOL was adopted during the Convention in 1973 and modified by a protocol in 1978.\n\n\f17\n\nsupported MPAF in upgrading its capacity to implement the International Clean Port Management\nPolicy since 1998.\n\n73. While  the  port  regulations  cover  control  of  pollution  at  the  port,  the  penalties  for  violating\nenvironmental  provisions  are  not  adequate.  The  maximum  fine  to  violators  US$171  (F$400)  is\nineffective as a deterrent. Costs of environmental remedies are much higher than these fines. To\ncomply  with  its  obligations  under  the  clean  port  management  policy  of  MARPOL,  MPAF  will\nincrease  the  penalties.  Within  2001,  MPAF  will  impose  custodial  sentences  on  environmental\nviolators to strengthen the deterrent value of the port regulations.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\n74.\nThe Project will support the Fiji Islands' return to its normal growth path of about 4 percent\nper  annum.  The  Project's  goals  are  to  achieve  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment;  support\ntrade,  investment,  and  private  sector  development;  and  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  the\neconomy. As the Fiji Islands returns to its normal multiparty and democratic political climate, cargo\nvolumes  are  also  expected  to  increase  in  line  with  GDP.  Additional  demand  for  port  services\ncomes from new exports of mineral water to the United States and animal feed to the Middle East,\nand imports of coal and bricks. The country\u2019s two primary ports in Suva and Lautoka handle nearly\nall  of  the  cargo,  with  Suva  Port  concentrating  on  containerized  traffic  and  Lautoka  Port  on  bulk\ncargo. Port and cargo management operations require improvement (paras. 37-38), and structural\nweaknesses of the wharf apron must be remedied (para. 34). The Project aims to extend the life of\nthe port facilities by 15 years and thus defer the need to relocate Suva Port operations to a new\nsite.\n\n75.\nPort  facilities  in  Lautoka  are  unable  to  attract  the  vessel  traffic  required  by  the  export\nindustry, which may have to forego opportunities and face increasing transport costs resulting from\ncomplex,  slow,  and  expensive  land-to-maritime  transport  interfaces.  Extension  of  Lautoka  Port's\nlife  and  facilities  (with  additional  berth  space,  storage,  and  landing  site  facilities)  will  support  the\ncountry\u2019s  port  system  by  improving  the  division  of  labor  between  the  two  ports,  thus  postponing\ninvestment in a new port facility. The proposed Project will enhance the regional competitiveness\nof  the  port  system  and  the  competitiveness  of  port  operations  by  improving  cargo  handling\nmanagement and by thus decreasing the turnaround time of ships.\n\nKing\u2019s  Wharf  complex  and  its  reclamation  area  do  not  comply  with  current  seismic\n76.\nstandards.  In  the  event  of  an  earthquake,  the  capital  area,  with  30  percent  of  the  country\u2019s\npopulation, risks losing its only port facility. This would have serious social implications, and result\nin  significant  loss  of  income.  Damage  to  the  remote  secondary  ports  and  the  connecting  roads\nwould complicate rescue operations. While a complete seismic upgrade is not financially feasible, the\nProject will strengthen two berths at the northern end of the wharf complex, providing a lifeline facility\nwith the minimum required seismic standard.\n\nNew  clients  near  Lautoka  Port  need  better  port  services  to  facilitate  trade  growth  and\n77.\nindustrial  and  agricultural  development.  The  proposed  extension  of  Queen\u2019s  Wharf  and  the\ncontainer  storage  area  will  significantly  increase  capacity  for  cargo  storage  and  handling  and\nberthing  space  for  cruise  and  cargo  vessels.  The  additional  at  Lautoka  Port  will  support  and\nencourage  development  of  the  local  export  industries,  both  cargo  and  tourism,  encourage\ninternational cargo vessel operators to make Lautoka a single point of call in the Fiji Islands, en route\nto the United States and eastern Pacific destinations. The services at Lautoka Port also are crucial\nto  an  optimal  allocation  of  container  traffic  between  Suva  and  Lautoka  to  reduce  impact  on  the\n\n\f18\n\nroad  system  and  the  environment.  These  services  are  also  essential  for  trade  growth.  Increased\nstorage and berth facilities will reduce inter-facing needed with Suva Port, reduce the social impact\nof  increased  cargo  loads  on  the  country\u2019s  primary  road  system,  reduce  freight  time  between  the\ndestination  ports,  allow  Lautoka  Port  to  cope  with  exports  from  new  local  industries,  and  thus\nenable the Fiji Islands to successfully compete for new export opportunities and capture the related\nemployment and growth potential.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe Project will (i) rehabilitate the existing facilities and extend the life of King\u2019s Wharf by 15\n78.\nyears,  and  (ii)  extend  wharf  and  storage  facilities  at  Lautoka  Port  to  support  new  trade  and\neconomic  growth  of  the  Fiji  Islands.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  (i) arrest  the  deterioration  of  the\nwharf decks at Suva and Lautoka ports; (ii) strengthen critical sections of King\u2019s Wharf, enabling it\nto  comply  with  internationally  recognized  seismic  standards  assessed  for  the  Fiji  Islands  and  the\nsite;  (iii) improve  King\u2019s  Wharf's  deck  and  container  yard  capacity  to  efficiently  handle  the\nincreasing  cargo  loads,  (iv)  increase  berth  space  at  Lautoka  Port;  and  (v)  increase  container\nstorage area at Lautoka Port by 6 ha.\n\n79.\n\nThe Project will provide the following:\n\n(i) \n\nAt Suva Port,\n\n(ii) \n\nAt Lautoka Port,\n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\ncivil works for repairs and rehabilitation of the King\u2019s Wharf;\ncivil  works  for  strengthening  critical  sections  of  King\u2019s  Wharf  to  meet\nseismic standards;\ncivil  works  for  wharf  deck  strengthening  of  the  King\u2019s  Wharf  life-line\nberths;\ncivil works for the container yard reorientation; and\nconsulting services for design, supervision, and contract administration.\n\ncivil works for a wharf extension of 154 m in length and 48 m in width, and\ninstallation of fenders and lighting;\ncivil works for a reinforced concrete-piled access bridge of 38 m in length\nand  12  m  in  width  linking  Queen's  Wharf  to  the  south-side  reclamation\narea;\ncivil works to reclaim 5.7 ha north of Queen\u2019s Wharf; and\nconsulting  services \nadministration.\n\nfor  design  review,  supervision,  and  contract\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1. \n\nMaintenance and Repair of King\u2019s Wharf\n\n80.\nThe key structural elements of King's Wharf at Suva Port have been adversely affected by\ncorrosion. This needs to be arrested and repairs made to meet the required loads and sustain the\nanticipated  handling  and  storage  operations.  The  facilities  for  sewage  management  are\ninadequate,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  enforce  the  environmental  Port  Regulations.  Additional\nsewerage connections  are proposed to enable ships\u2019 sewage to be to channeled to shore-based\ntreatment facilities. Without the proposed maintenance and repair works, the life of King\u2019s Wharf is\nestimated to end in 2005.\n\n\f19\n\n2. \n\nSeismic Strengthening of King\u2019s Wharf\n\n81.\nThe fundamental technical justification for the seismic strengthening relates to the stability of\nthe  entire  reclamation  at  Suva  Port.  Seismic  stability  analyses  conducted  in  199324  showed  that\nfailure,  amounting  to  a  lateral  displacement  of  1  m  at  the  top  of  the  sheet  piles,  will  occur  in  an\nearthquake  of  generating  ground  accelerations  at  0.1g.25  This  corresponds  to  about  a  third  of  the\nassessed earthquake risk. The current seismic deficiencies in the structure can be resolved by tying\nthe structure to the reclamation area. Comprehensive information and analyses of the stability  and\nthe  prospect  of  liquefaction  were  prepared  in  1998.26  The  risk  of  soil  liquefaction  has  been\ninvestigated and assessed as low.\n\n82.\nThe calculated safety factors under earthquakes of generating ground acceleration of 0.3 g\nand  0.1  g.27  An  acceptable  seismic  load  safety  factor  is  in  excess  of  1.25.  The  1953  Suva\nearthquake generated a ground acceleration of 0.2 g at the site.28 The current stability of Suva Port\nfalls well short of the standard required for any new facility designed in the Suva area. The current\nreclamation area can withstand 0.073 g ground acceleration compared with a requirement of 0.38\ng, or is only 20 percent of the required standard. Thus, King\u2019s Wharf needs seismic strengthening.\nWhile a complete seismic upgrading is not financially feasible, the Project will strengthen the two\nmost frequently used berths at the northern end, Walu Bay Wharf, and a northern section of King\u2019s\nWharf.\n\n3.\n\nStrengthening the Deck of King\u2019s Wharf\n\nThe wharf deck slab is inadequate to support the anticipated loads and is barely sufficient\n83.\nfor the present loading operation. The longitudinal beams, assuming no deterioration, have only 65\npercent  of  their  required  strength.  Many  have  significant  deterioration  due  to  corrosion.  Only  two\nbridge sections connecting the container yard to the wharf are fully rated to carry a loaded 25-ton\nforklift truck. The proposed civil works include restoration of the longitudinal beams to their original\ncondition. These beams support the bridge units and require strengthening to take the increased\nloads. The proposed replacement of the bridge units will cater for the heavier loading. The recent\nload  testing  of  the  beam  strength  revealed  that  this  strengthening  will  also  enable  operation  of  a\nmobile  crane  on  the  apron.  Such  a  crane  would  permit  servicing  of  vessels  that  do  not  have\ncranes, and this would significantly enhance the productivity of the port.\n\n4.\n\nExtension of Queen\u2019s Wharf\n\n84.\nQueen's Wharf provides only one berth for large container vessels. To provide more berthing\nspace and flexibility for berth management, and to reduce conflicts for berth use, 150 m by 48 m will\nincrease the useful life of the berth by 50 years, and accommodate vessels up to 70,000 dead-weight\ntons  (DWT)  with  a  maximum  draught  of  12.5  m  on  its  western  berth  and  10,000  DWT  with  a\nmaximum draught of 7.5 m on the eastern berth. The size and structural design of the extension will\nallow forklift handling of fully laden 40 foot containers and temporary storage of up to 72 containers. It\nwill thus provide an additional berth for container vessels at Lautoka. The new facility is designed to\nenhance  of  container  loading  and  unloading.  It  will  allow  berthing  of  international  traffic  with  a\nmaximum  draught  of  12.5  m  at  the  west  berth  and  7.5  m  on  the  east.  The  design  will  provide\nflexibility  to  concurrently  berth  two  vessels;  accommodate  forklift  trucks  of  30  ton  capacity;\n                                                \n24 Murray-North/CMPS of April 1993.\n25 g = acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 meters/second/second.\n26 Geotechnical Review of King\u2019s Wharf,  February 1998.\n27 Ratio of strength to the applied load.\n28 April 1998.\n\n\f20\n\naccommodate  TEU  containers  stacked  three  and  four  high  wide  in  the  middle;  and  be  easily\nextended in the future. The seismic design of the new structural components comply with Fiji Islands'\ncodes of practice and current loading code used in New Zealand.\n\n5.\n\nAccess Bridge to Lautoka Wharf\n\n85.\nAn area to the south of Queen's Wharf is currently being reclaimed and will provide additional\ncontainer storage for 372 TEU containers. The proposed access bridge is located to minimize travel\ndistance between Queen\u2019s Wharf and the new container yard. The 34 m by 12 m access bridge will\ntake axle loads of 95 tons. This will allow the bridge to support fully laden forklift truck operations.\n\n6.\n\nReclamation\n\nCurrent  container  storage  is  limited  to  35  ground  spaces.  This  will  rise  to  124  container\n86.\nspaces  with  the  reclamation.  The  proposed  wharf  extension  will  provide  a  further  24  container\nground  slots.  Throughput  of  containers  is  expected  to  rise  from  the  present  100  containers  per\nweek  to  450  per  week  to  accommodate  water  exports  by  the  end  of  2003.  Additional  throughput\nfrom animal feed exports is projected to be 600 containers per week in 2003. The civil works for\nthe  proposed  reclamation  will  require  the  installation  and  compaction  of  gravel,  basecourse\nlighting,  power  points,  water  and  sewerage,  120  m  by  10  m  access  road  connecting  the  marine\ndrive  with  the  reclaimed  container  yard,  and  a  small  public  recreational  park  of  0.25  ha  at  the\nreclamation and in accordance with the Town Planning Act, 1978, and town planning guidelines of\nLautoka City Council.\n\n7.\n\nRemedial Work at Lautoka\n\n87.\nThe proposed extension to the north shows the vital importance of Queen's Wharf. The new\nfacilities  will  depend  on  Queen's  Wharf  for  access,  which  is  deteriorating  and  requires  remedial\nrepair  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  survey  the  technical  condition  of  the  wharf,  and\nimplement works necessary to maintain the integrity of the 1,000 piles, supporting beams, and the\nconcrete deck.\n\nThe total cost of the proposed Project, including taxes, duties, and financing costs29 during\n88.\nconstruction,  is  estimated  at  US$32.26  million  equivalent,  of  which  the  foreign  exchange  cost  is\nabout  US$17.61  million  (55  percent)  and  the  local  currency  cost  (including  taxes  and  duties)  is\nabout US$14.65 million equivalent (45 percent).\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n89.\nMPAF  has  requested  a  loan  of  US$16.80  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to\nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an\ninterest  rate  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,30  a\ncommitment fee of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of 1.0 (the fee will be capitalized in the loan),\nand conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms set in forth in the Draft\nLoan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for MPAF\u2019s decision to borrow\nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)\n\n                                                \n29 Includes interest and commitment charges on ADB\u2019s loan.\n30 London interbank offered rate.\n\n\f21\n\nstatement that these choices were MPAF\u2019s independent decision and not made in reliance on any\ncommunication or advice of ADB.\n\n90.\nMPAF  has  secured  cofinancing  from  the  Australia  and  New  Zealand  Banking  Group  (ANZ\nBank) to help finance local costs of the Project. ANZ Bank has confirmed a loan of F$14 million to\nMPAF.31 MPAF will finance all local currency costs of the Project from its own resources, in case this\ncofinancing does not materialize for any reason.

ADB  approval  is\nrequired for the evaluation of all bidders prior to the issuance of the invitation for tender and for the\nbid  evaluation  prior  to  the  award  of  contract.  The  prequalification  documents  and  bidding\ndocuments  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  Procurement  of  equipment  is  not\nenvisaged under the Project.\n\n94.\nThe  construction  works  are  divided  into  five  tentative  contract  packages  (Appendix  8).\nThese  are:  (i)  King's  Wharf  maintenance  repairs,  (ii)  King's  Wharf  seismic  upgrade  and  deck\nstrengthening, (iii) demolition of two storage sheds, (iv) container yard civil works, and (v) Lautoka\nWharf  extension  and  bridge  construction.  The  works  need  to  be  flexible  to  alter  locations  to\nminimize disruption of port operations. Contractors will be eligible to tender for one or more of the\ncontract packages within their bid capacities. ADB approval prior to the award of contracts will be\nrequired for all contracts.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nA tentative implementation schedule is given in Appendix 9. This allows for the application\n95.\nof  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  in  the  selection  of  consultants  for  design  and\nsupervision. The selection process has commenced in the fourth quarter of 2001. Contracts for civil\nworks  are  expected  to  be  awarded  in  the  second  quarter  of  2002.  The  pre-construction  activities\nwill commence in the second quarter of 2002 and the construction be completed within four years,\nby mid-2006. A technical review of the Project will be conducted jointly with MPAF during the first\nquarter of 2003.\n\n4.\n\nReporting, Accounts, and Audit\n\n96.\nMPAF will provide ADB and the Government with quarterly progress reports concerning the\nProject's  financial  aspects,  design,  preconstruction  activities,  and  all  civil  works.  Project\nimplementation  consultants  will  assist  in  this  reporting  responsibility.  MPAF  will  provide  annual\nreports  on  wharf  and  container-yard  maintenance  budgets,  activities,  and  expenditures  covering\nthe  past,  present,  and  foreseeable  future.  MPAF  will  advise  ADB  on  progress  achieved  in\nimplementing  further  commercialization  and  privatization  policy  initiatives,  regulations,  and\nreorganization  of  MPAF.  To  facilitate  post-evaluation  of  the  Project,  MPAF  will  provide  ADB  and\nthe Government, within three months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that\nwill  comprehensively  cover  details  of  project  implementation,  benefits  and  costs,  and  any  other\ninformation that may be requested by ADB concerning the Project.\n\n\f23\n\nMPAF will establish and maintain separate accounts for all expenditures under the Project,\n97.\nincluding  its  individual  components.  It  will  furnish  ADB  with  financial  statements  reflecting  the\naccounts  for  each  project-related  contract.  These  financial  statements  will  be  audited  using\ninternational auditing guidelines by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements,\ntogether  with  the  auditor\u2019s  report,  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  six  months  of  the  end  of  each\nrelated  fiscal  year.  Supervising  consultants  will  keep  detailed  costing  of  project  components  and\nassist MPAF with reporting, as required.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nDisbursements  will  be  made  for  eligible  expenditures  under  ADB's  Disbursement\n98.\nGuidelines  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  1996.  Under \nthe  proposed\nimplementation arrangements, all applications for withdrawing loan funds for eligible expenditures\nwill be carried out by direct payment or reimbursement procedures.\n\n6.\n\nTechnical Review\n\n99.\nIn addition to a schedule of twice yearly, regular review meetings to monitor the progress of\nthe Project, a technical review of the Project will be carried out during the first quarter of 2003. The\nfocus  of  the  review  will  be  to  determine  a  need  for  any  deviations  from  the  project  design  or\nimplementation; cost overruns; loan reallocations; and other factors, if any, including assumptions\nand  risks  that  might  constrain  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Project  and  achievement  of\ndevelopment objectives.\n\n7.\n\nLand Rights\n\n100.  The two ports of Suva and Lautoka are on land leased from the Government. All rights to\nland, dredging, and fishing have been acquired for the seabed under the Lautoka wharf extension\nand  reclamation  components.  Arrangements  for  the  fill  source  will  be  established  by  MPAF  in\naccordance with the Government\u2019s laws on land acquisition and compensation. The Government\u2019s\nland  acquisition  procedures,  compensation  rates,  and  processes  for  resolving  grievances  are\nsatisfactory and in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy. No resettlement is required under the Project.\n\n8.\n\nProject Performance Evaluation\n\n101. MPAF  will  compile  and  analyze  data  to  facilitate  project  performance  monitoring  and\nevaluation.  It  will  forward  this  information  to  ADB  and  the  Government  in  accordance  with  the\nagreed  schedule  of  performance  measurement  indicators  in  Appendix  10.  This  program  aims  to\nassess the macroeconomic impact and sector development goals of the Project. It includes three\nmajor  activities:  (i)  benchmarking,  to  provide  MPAF  management  with  objective  reference  points\nfor impact evaluation that correspond with the needs of the port users and consumers; (ii) benefit\nmonitoring,  to  ensure  that  the  project  benefits  actually  accrue  to  the  port  users;  and  (iii)  post-\nproject performance evaluation, to assess the overall effectiveness of the Project.\n\nG.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n102.\nPAF operated from 1975 to 1998. In 1998, MPAF assumed the responsibilities of PAF. MPAF\nis managed by a board that is accountable to the ministers of the Ministry of Public Enterprises and\nMCWE.  MPAF's  operations  are  directed  by  an  executive  officer,  who  is  assisted  by  financial,\ntechnical, and corporate general managers.\n\n\f24\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Management and Accounting\n\nfinance,  billing  and  customer  accounting,  payroll,  and \n\n103. MPAF\u2019s  small  finance  department  comprising  13  people  is  responsible  for  financial\nplanning,  corporate \nfinancial  and\nmanagement  reporting.  It  uses  modern  computerized  systems.  It  has  a  well-organized  general\nledger  that  produces  budgetary  comparisons  by  business  unit  and  responsibility  center.  Monthly\nfinancial reports are available within 15 days of the end of each month. The auditor generally signs\nthe  annual  financial  statements  about  six  months  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  which\nconforms  with  the  statutory  requirement.  Managers  for  finance  and  information  systems  report  to\nthe  general  finance  manager.  A  wide  area  network  is  planned  to  connect  the  port  management\nsystems with the corporate database and financial management systems.\n\n104. MPAF\u2019s  financial  administration  is  well  managed  and  responsive  to  organizational  needs.\nThe  financial  development  plans  are  sound.  The  ADB-supported  TA  for  port  asset  improvement\nwill  outline  a  program  for  improving  MPAF's  commercial  and  operational  performance,  including\naddressing accounting policies and developing traffic forecasting and financial planning models for\nMPAF (para. 71).\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Performance of MPAF\n\na.\n\nFinancial Reports and Plans\n\n105. MPAF\u2019s  fourth  statement  of  corporate  intent  contains  a  review  of  the  main  activities,\npolicies,  and plans,  including  borrowings, major asset procurement and disposal, and accounting\npolicies. Its quantified performance targets include one year\u2019s revenue, gross profit, operating profit\nand net tax paid profit, and nonfinancial targets of grant levy claim and industrial lost time.\n\nThe  corporate  plan  sets  out  MPAF\u2019s  vision,  mission,  values,  and  objectives  classified  as\n106.\nshort, medium, and long term. It includes financial projections for FY2001-FY2003.32 Gross and net\nprofits are projected to increase due to revenue growth of 13 percent outstripping cost increases of\n7 percent over the period. The accompanying cash-flow statement indicates the need for US$12.2\nmillion  (F$28.5  million)  of  new  borrowings  to  finance  capital  works,  repay  US$3.7  million  (F$8.6\nmillion)  of  loans,  and  close  with  about  US$1.1  million  (F$2.6  million)  on  hand  at  the  end  of\nFY2002.33\n\nThe  FY2001  budget  is  prepared  by  responsibility  centers  with  the  principal  profit  centers\n107.\nbeing the ports of Suva and Lautoka. Budget figures form the basis of the financial projections. The\nprojections incorporate the new tariff as of 1 July 2001.\n\nb.\n\nTariffs\n\nThe  tariffs  were  reviewed  in  1998,34  with  a  conclusion  that  the  tariff  structure  requires\n108.\nsimplification. The revised port tariff structure became effective on 1 July 2001. This simplified the\ntariff,  and  will  enhance  its  effectiveness  in  ensuring  economic  use  of  the  port  facilities.  The  tariff\nrevision will likely result in a maximum increase in revenue of 5 percent. The revised tariff includes\nmaritime charges of port dues; dockage; mooring; and anchorage dues; pilotage and towage fees;\n                                                \n32 Key assumptions: (i) unadjusted tariff, (ii) acceptance of staff and assets transferred from the Marine Department and\n\nassociated costs, (iii) no offsetting revenue, and (iv) volume projections at a low level.\n\n33 The capital investment projections include US$22.5 million for the King's Wharf rehabilitation; 63 percent of this sum,\n\nUS$14.2 million, is included as ADB\u2019s loan.\n\n34 KPMG Management Consulting Pty, Ltd. 1998. Tariff Review and Restructure. MPAF, Suva.\n\n\f25\n\nenvironmental  charge,  wharfage  charged  by  MPAF;  and  charges  for  demurrage,  and  storage,\ncargo  handling,  and  auxiliary  services  charged  by  PTL.  Tugboat  charges  are  no  longer  included\nunder  the  revised  tariff,  and  are  envisaged  to  be  set  from  January  2002  freely  by  the  private\nservice provider(s).\n\n109. Port dues are fees for the use of port facilities, space on berth, and marine services. The\ndues are based on vessel type and registry. With no fundamental changes, the revised port dues\ncontinue  to  favor  local  vessels.  The  port  dues,  however,  are  generally  levied  per  vessel  call.  An\nanchorage  fee  has  been  added  in  the  revised  tariff  and  no  significant  change  is  implemented  in\nmooring charge. The two are levied regardless of vessel type or registry.\n\n110. A charge for hiring a pilot vessel is levied on all vessels entering the ports, even when the\nship\u2019s master is qualified to enter or leave a port without a pilot. The charge reflects a considerable\nproportion  of  fixed  costs  and  safety  involved  in  providing  pilotage  services.  The  pilotage  fees\nincreased  significantly  under  the  tariff  revision,  reflecting  the  cost  of  the  service.  Mooring  and\ndockage levies have fundamentally remained unchanged.\n\n111. Wharfage  comprises  fees  for  landing  cargo  on  the  wharf.  In  general,  the  rates  have  been\nsimplified,  and  charges  for  landing  empty  containers  and  transhipment  containers  have  been\nintroduced.  The  revised  break-bulk  cargo  wharfage  rates  favor  exports,  while  the  old  tariff\nencouraged  imports,  and  the  bulk  rates  have  been  simplified,  reduced,  and  restructured  to\nencourage export of Fijian bulk cargo.\n\n112. Demurrage  and  container  and  bulk  cargo  storage  on  the  port  premises  is  free  for  the  first\nthree  days.  Relatively  high  escalation  of  the  storage  tariff  for  additional  storage  days  has  kept\ndemurrage levels low and use of space efficient. The storage tariff has been considerably simplified.\n\n113. An  environmental  charge  was  introduced  in  March  2001  to  finance  operations  of  a  fast-\nresponse  anti-pollution  unit,  its  equipment,  training,  and  support  to  implement  the  environmental\nimprovement  program.  In  1999,  Suva  Port's  compliance  with  the  MARPOL  was  considered\nmarginal, and vessels generally did not comply with environmental guidelines at the port. With the\nsupport of the Ports of Sydney, MPAF has identified environmental equipment for procurement, will\nliaise  with  the  petroleum  industry  in  the  country  on  effective  response  mechanisms  to  potential\naccidents,  and  will  train  staff  for  a  quick  response  unit.  The  University  of  the  South  Pacific  has\nbeen  contracted  to  monitor  water  quality  conditions  at  Suva  Port  and  will  assess  the  scope  of\nimprovement in the required port environment.\n\nc.\n\nPast Performance of PAF\n\n114. PAF  reported  modest  operating  profits  before  interest  and  tax  during  FY1994-FY199735\nvarying from 6 to 14 percent of fixed assets in service. However, it suffered heavy abnormal and\nextraordinary  losses  during  the  same  period,  mainly  for  losses  on  foreign  currency  denominated\nloans, redundancy payments, write-offs of subsidiary company debts, payment of indemnities, and\nvalue-added tax adjustments. Despite the low gearing (debt-to-equity ratio averaging about 0.15)\nthe earning rate on owner\u2019s equity ranged from negative in FY1994 to 12.1 percent in the following\nyear. This fell to 3.5 percent in FY1997.36\n\n                                                \n35 FY1997  was  in  fact  14  months  ending  on  28  February  1998;  FY1998  was  13  months  ending  on  31  March  1999.\n\nMPAF\u2019s balance date is now fixed at 31 March.\n\n36 As a statutory authority, PAF was exempt from income tax. MPAF as a CSA under the Public Enterprise Act is liable\n\nfor tax and dividend payments.\n\n\f26\n\n115. Since  repaying  most  of  its  foreign  currency  denominated  loans,  MPAF  has  borrowed\nheavily  on  a  short-term  basis  in  the  local  market  using  a  range  of  instruments,  including  finance\nleases,  promissory  notes,  and  bonds.  Most  have  now  been  repaid  and  replaced  with  a  secured\nlocal currency term loan from the ANZ Banking Group at 7.0 percent.\n\nThe gross profit (revenue less direct operating costs) as a percentage of revenue, declined\n116.\nin each of the three years, from 25.7 percent to 18.9 percent in FY1997, reflecting increasing costs.\nThis further declined to 18 percent in 2000 and 16 percent in 2001, on the account of lower traffic\nvolumes, but is forecasted to improve to 20 and 25 percent in 2002 and 2003.\n\n117.\nPAF was, and MPAF is, very capital intensive. In all years, the value of fixed assets exceeds\nthe combined investment of lenders and owner. The working capital ratios are poor with only about\nUS$0.25  (F$0.60)  of  current  assets  covering  each  dollar  of  current  liabilities  and  this  amount  is\ndeclining. However, this is not of concern because it is due to the large current portions of short- to\nmedium-term borrowings that have been due for repayment in past years. The ADB-funded TA will\naddress debt management issues of MPAF.\n\nd.\n\nFinancial Performance of MPAF\n\n118. Stevedoring  operations,  US$1.2  million  (F$2.8  million)  of  operating  assets,  and\nUS$128,520  (F$300,000)  working  capital  were  transferred  to  PTL  on  1  March  1988.  In  Tables  2\nand 3, FY1998 is the first year of MPAF\u2019s operations. Detailed financial performance forecasts are\ngiven in Appendix 11.\n\nTable 2: PAF/MPAF Income Statements FY1994-FY2006\n(F$ million)\n\n1997\nActual\n\n1995\n1996\nActual\nActual\n31 Deca 31 Deca 14 mos to\n28/2/98\n23.61\n19.16\n4.45\n\n 19.60\n 15.51\n4.09\n\n20.00\n14.86\n5.14\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nForecast Rev.

Much of the decline in revenue and operating profit between 1997 and 1998 is attributable\nto  the  reduced  scope  of  operations  and  from  2000  to  2001  due  to  the  reduction  in  cargo\nthroughput.  While  the  tariff  revision  of  1995  restored  profitability,  the  decline  resumed  in\nsubsequent years when the rates were unchanged and costs, particularly for administration, grew.\nThe operating profit (before interest and tax) turned into a small loss of US$122,094 (F$285,000) in\nFY1998.  Regular  short-term  borrowing  using  instruments  such  as  promissory  notes  and  bonds\nrequired heavy regular repayments that reduced the debt service cover and gave a negative self-\nfinancing ratio. Liquidity was good at all times, mainly because MPAF\u2019s terms of business require\nport charges to be prepaid, and receivables are low at around two weeks of revenue. In spite of the\nfrequent short-term borrowing, the total long-term debt capital employed is very low at less than 10\npercent of total employed capital.\n\n120.\nThe  rate  increases,  together  with  traffic  growth  projected  at  2.8  percent  per  annum,  are\nforecast to arrest the decline in profitability for a period, but are insufficient to offset the assumed 4\npercent per annum price inflation on operating costs. Profitability is projected to fall markedly again\nfrom FY2004, when depreciation charges on the rehabilitated wharf take effect.\n\n121. MPAF will, nevertheless, remain financially strong. It exhibits the classic characteristics of a\ncapital  intensive,  low  growth  utility,  generating  high  free  cash  flows.  As  a  result  of  a  stable  debt\nstructure, its debt service cover is projected to be greater than 1 from FY1998 and remain above\n1.5  for  all  subsequent  years  but  one.  With  completion  of  the  Project,  the  self-financing  ratio  will\nincrease from less than 1 to exceed 2 from FY2004. As a result of the proposed loan, the ratio of\ndebt-to-equity  will  rise  to  the  0.30  level,  and  the  proportion  of  capital  employed  financed  by  the\nowners will fall to about 80 percent. The projections indicate that if no dividends are paid, MPAF\nwill need about US$3.0 million of new borrowings to finance its capital expenditure program. This\nroughly offsets the amount of income tax payable over the same period. The agreed assurances\nrequire  that  MPAF  maintains  (i)  an  operating  profit  of  not  less  than  3  percent  to  be  earned  on\naverage net revalued fixed assets in service, and (ii) the debt service cover at a minimum of 1.5\ncommencing from FY2000. Under the assurances, the Government will not draw any dividends or\neffect any other drawdowns from MPAF, unless MPAF meets these financial conditions.\n\n122.\nThe ADB-funded TA for port asset management improvement (footnote 21) will, in addition\nto its other objectives, recommend a program to improve the commercial and operational efficiency\n\n\f28\n\nof MPAF. This includes addressing issues of (i) MPAF\u2019s management autonomy and authority; (ii)\naccountability  for  commercial  performance  of  MPAF;  (iii)  fair  market  conditions  in  the  sector;  (iv)\nMPAF\u2019s financial and operational targets; (v) accounting policies on depreciation and amortization;\n(vi) commercial development planning; (vii) the financial position of MPAF; (viii) foreign exchange\nrisk  mitigation  planning;  (ix)  interconnected  planning  models  for  traffic  forecasting;  (x)  financial\nplanning and management over a wide area network; (xi) accounting systems to match costs and\nrevenues by operating centers; and (xii) application of generally accepted accounting policies and\ncommercially  based  operations,  in  particular  for  depreciation,  debt,  and  foreign  exchange\nmanagement.  Loan  assurances  require  that  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  implementing  the  TA\u2019s\nrecommendations on these areas be agreed by MPAF and ADB within 2002 (para. 140, item [ii]).\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n123.\nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Accordingly,  an  initial\nenvironmental examination (IEE) was prepared for the Suva and Lautoka Port Project components\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE\nconcluded that impacts of the Project on the environment are within acceptable levels and can be\neffectively mitigated during construction and operations. Subsequently, no detailed environmental\nimpact  assessment  is  warranted.  With  the  adoption  of  sound  engineering  practices  and\nimplementation  of  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  described  in  Appendix  12,  environmental\nimpact during construction can be mitigated. These practices and measures will also be included in\nthe contracts for the civil works. Experienced construction supervision consultants will be engaged\nby  MPAF  to  supervise  the  implementation  of  sound  engineering  practices  and  environmental\nmitigation actions. The summary IEE is given in Appendix 13.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Considerations\n\na.\n\nWaste Control\n\n124. Provision of the proposed ship-to-shore sewerage connection will improve the environment\nin  Suva  Port  and  its  vicinity.  The  Department  of  Public  Works  of  MCWE  has  confirmed  that  the\nadditional sewage from ships can be managed within the capacity of the Suva sewage treatment\nplant. The risk of a leakage from the pipeline is negligible due to the small incremental quantity of\nwaste from the ships. This pipeline will, on the other hand, enable the port to control the discharge\nof ship wastes. Together with improved enforcement of the port regulations, discharging of these\nwastes  onto  the  wharf  and  into  the  port  waters  will  decrease  significantly.  As  a  result,  the  water\nquality at the port will improve.\n\nb.\n\nSeismic Risk\n\n125.\nThe recent earthquakes in the Asian and Pacific region have demonstrated the far-reaching\nsocial  implications  when  port  facilities  suffer  major  earthquake  damage.  The  situation  in  the  Fiji\nIslands  is  critical.  Immediately  following  a  major  earthquake,  loss  of  King\u2019s  Wharf  would  require\nrelief supplies to come through Lautoka Port by road to the capital area. This would be complex,\nexpensive,  and  time  consuming.  Were  the  roads  to  incur  damage,  this  option  would  become\nimpossible. If King\u2019s Wharf could not be used immediately after a major earthquake, considerable\nsocial disruption and difficulty in the relief effort can be assumed. This would be compounded by a\nserious loss of business revenue.\n\n\f29\n\nThe proposed development at Lautoka provides additional capacity to serve as Fiji Islands\u2019\n126.\nmain port in the event of earthquake. Use of Lautoka under such a scenario would lead to severe\ncongestion,  disrupt  established  social  and  commercial  activities,  and  place  stress  on  the  road\nsystem. Although new facilities at Lautoka will be designed to modern standards, Queen\u2019s Wharf\nmeets only two thirds of these requirements. The proposed deferred and regular maintenance and\nremedial work are necessary to maintain its structural integrity.\n\nc.\n\nCargo Handling\n\n127. An  important  social  impact  is  expected  from  improved  cargo  handling  operations.  The\nintroduction  of  competition,  and  improved  employment  of  technology  in  cargo  handling  will\nenhance productivity and reliability of these services at Suva Port. The proposed civil works make\nthese efficiency improvements possible. The added reliability and productivity improvements help\nkeep  down  freight  rates  to  the  Fiji  Islands  and  enhance  the  frequency  of  ship  visits.  Increased\nefficiency  resulting  from  the  reduced  time  spent  on  container  handling,  will  be  evidenced  in  a\ndecline in real freight cost per volume of cargo. A decrease in tariffs will reduce, in the long term,\nthe  overall  real  freight  costs  of  imports  and  exports.  These  will  constitute  savings,  adding  to  the\ndisposable income of Fijians.\n\nd.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n128.\nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  real  cost  of  freight  for  imports  and  exports  through  its  physical\nimprovements and policy content that will lead to improvements in the efficiency of port services and\ncommercial  performance  of  the  sector.  About  50  percent  of  the  consumer  price  index  comprises\nimported  goods\u2014all  affected  by  freight  rates.  The  real  reduction  in  the  consumer  price  index  will\nreduce expenditures by the poor. The project loan terms have limited, if any, impact on poverty. The\nProject will yield considerable savings for society as it will defer a large-scale port relocation project\nby 15 years.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nTraffic Projections\n\nTraffic and cargo volumes for Suva Port have been estimated on the basis of a low case\n129.\nscenario developed under a feasibility study for the Suva Port relocation project. This reviewed the\nhistorical  trends  in  the  Fiji  Islands'  commodity  trade  and  planned  economic  developments.  A\ngrowth rate of 2.3 percent per annum is used to forecast growth of cargo volumes. The throughput\nforecast is shown in Appendix 14. Details of the financial and economic analyses are in Appendix\n15.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n130. A  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  for  the  Project  components  at  Suva  and\nLautoka. Least-cost technical options have been selected for each project component as well as the\nentire Project. The financial analysis is based on with- and without-project comparison and presents\nall costs at constant values.\n\n131.\nFor  Suva,  under  the  without-project  case,  no  relocation  of  the  current  port  operation  is\nassumed, and the current facility is allowed to run to the end of its economic life, although incurring\n\n\f30\n\nincreasing maintenance and repair requirements as the structure deteriorates. The revenues include\nship revenues calculated with the new tariff from 1 July 2001. With the Project, the traffic volume is\nassumed to recover to the underlying trend prior to the political disturbances of May 2000 by the end\nof  2002,  and  thereafter  grow  by  2.3  percent  per  annum.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  growth  will  be\naffected by reducing serviceability of the wharf structure, and a lower rate of 1.0 percent is assumed\nuntil 2005, then growth will stabilize and eventually slowly decline as the wharf reaches the end of its\noperable  life.  A  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  22.3  percent  was  obtained  for  the  Project  and  a\nUS$7.6 million (F$17.7 million) net present value at a 12 percent discount rate.\n\nFor  Lautoka,  without  the  project,  growth  in  the  newly  developing  trades  in  bottled  water\n132.\nwould  be  constrained  and  the  water  would  continue  to  be  shipped  by  road  to  Suva,  bearing\nrelatively  high  inland  transport  costs.  The  export  of  animal  feed  also  depends  on  additional\ncapacity at Lautoka and it is assumed that this trade would not develop without the Project. Other\ngenerated traffic would not occur and there would be no transfer between road transport of inward\nfreight from Suva Port to Lautoka Port as volumes would be insufficient to induce ship calls. With\nthe Project, it is assumed that new trades would develop as projected by their stakeholders. The\nProject  is  estimated  to  achieve  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  16.5  percent  with  a  US$3.47\nmillion (F$8.1 million) net present value at 12 percent discount rate.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n133.\nEconomic values for costs and benefits are obtained by extracting taxes and duties, and by\napplying a standard conversion factor of 0.986 and labor conversion factor of 0.86 calculated for Fiji\nIslands. For Suva Port, the economic benefits of the project comprise returns to shippers of cargo in\nthe form of savings in handling charges\u2014at present a US$64.3 (F$150) surcharge per TEU is added\nto  the  normal  freight  rate  to  recover  costs  to  vessel  operators  from  cargo  handling  inefficiencies\n(para.  60).  The  seismic  strengthening  confers  a  benefit  from  the  averted  damage  cost  should  an\nearthquake occur, expressed as the expected value of damage multiplied by the annual probability of\noccurrence. An economic internal rate of return of 15.8 percent has been obtained, and a net present\nvalue of US$2.16 million (F$5.0 million) at a discount rate of 12 percent. It does also not calculate the\nrelated  impact  on  the  country\u2019s  balance  of  payments,  reserve  position,  and  debt  repayment\ncapability. Social consequences from the without-project case would include those from a reduction\nin imports of essential commodities, including medication. The analysis highlights the lifeline value of\nKing\u2019s Wharf to the country and underlines the emergency nature of the rehabilitation works under\nthe Project.\n\nFor the Lautoka component, economic benefits arise from efficiencies in cargo handling as a\n134.\nresult of being able to move full containers by forklift truck on the new wharf rather than the slower\nprocess  of  loading  containers  onto  trailers.  The  extension  removes  the  constraint  of  container\nvessels not being able to berth because a ship at the bulk terminal berth. This saves ship time. There\nis  also  a  substantial  reduction  in  inland  transportation,  with  benefits  in  vehicle  operating  and  road\nmaintenance  cost  savings.  Reduction  in  heavy  road  transport  between  Lautoka  and  Suva  will  also\nreduce traffic noise and safety risks to small villages along the route, although these have not been\nquantified. An economic internal rate of return of 17.6 percent has been estimated and a US$4.23\nmillion (F$9.8 million) net present value at 12 percent discount rate.\n\n4.\n\nLeast Cost Analysis for the Seismic Strengthening\n\nThe  seismic  strengthening  of  King's  Wharf  under  the  proposed  Project  is  given  an\n135.\nadditional economic analysis. The wharf is of significant strategic and economic importance to Fiji\nIslands. It is expected to have an enhanced role in a recovery period following a natural disaster of\nany  kind.  As  a  responsible  port  asset  manager,  MPAF  needs  to  ensure  that  all  its  assets  are\n\n\f31\n\ndesigned to the required minimum standards, including the seismic standards. Subsequently, there\nis  a  pressing  need  to  strengthen  the  wharf  to  provide  this  minimum  security.  Stability  analyses\ncarried out in 1998 indicated a safety factor of 0.4 for a 150-year return period event. This results in\na much higher risk than is normally accepted. Modern facilities are designed for a larger, 450-year\nevent, to have a safety factor of more than 1.0. The seismic strengthening under the Project is the\nleast  cost  option for  bringing King's  Wharf to the minimum acceptable seismic standards. Due to\nthe friction pile structure in the southern end of the King\u2019s Wharf complex, the cost of a full seismic\nupgrade is high. A full upgrade of the four Walu Bay berths and the three King\u2019s Wharf berths was\nestimated  in  January  1999  to  cost  US$18  million  (F$42  million).  For  the  two  lifeline  berths,  the\nseismic  upgrade  was  estimated  to  cost  US$4.5  million  (F$10.4  million).  Thus,  a  partial  technical\noption  has  been  selected  covering  strengthening  the  two  berths  at  the  northern  end  of  King\u2019s\nwharf.  This  strengthening  is  sufficient  to  protect  the  two  most  frequently  used  berths,  adjoining\nreclamation, and container yard.\n\n136. Damage if an earthquake occurs the year following completion of strengthening has been\nestimated.  Earthquakes  of  various  intensities  ranging  from  0.1  g  to  0.41  g  were  considered.  The\nobtained  benefit-cost  ratios,  shown  in  Table  4,  demonstrate  the  need  to  immediately  mitigate\nseismic risk. If an earthquake with an intensity equal to the 1953 tremor (with a return period of 50\nyears) occurs after the seismic strengthening, benefits will exceed costs by a factor of 1.4. Benefit\ncost ratios for a 150-year earthquake are in excess of 3.0 and for a 450 year earthquake, in excess\nof  5.0.  The  benefit-cost  ratios  are  also  shown  for  the  alternative  technical  option,  the  full  seismic\nupgrade.  The  proposed  new  developments  at  Lautoka  will  be  designed  to  meet  modern  seismic\ncodes, which will provide acceptable factors of safety.\n\nTable 4: Benefit-Cost Ratios from Mitigation of Seismic Risk\n\nEarthquake\nIntensity\n(Gravity 1.0 g)\n0.10\n0.20\n0.32\n0.38\n0.41\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\nReturn\nPeriod\n25\n50\n150\n450\n1000\n\nBenefit to Cost Ratio for\nPartial Seismic Mitigation\n0.1\n1.4\n3.0\n5.3\n8.5\n\nBenefit to Cost Ratio for\nFull Seismic Upgrade\n0.04\n0.50\n1.20\n2.03\n3.10\n\n137. As designed, the Project does not face unusual risks. Growth in traffic and cargo volumes\nto Suva Port is likely to exceed the forecast contributing to the urgent need to complete the Project.\nThe  costs  are  based  on  conservative  estimates  and  high  physical  contingencies  are  allowed  for\nunforeseen cost increases and design modifications that may arise from the detailed engineering\ndesign.\n\n138. Key parameters in the financial and economic analyses have been subjected to a sensitivity\ntest to assess the possible unfavorable scenarios. The analysis indicates that the Project remains\neconomically viable.

It includes a benefit monitoring program and measurement indicators. The role\nof  the  report  is  to  provide  benchmark  information  for  the  Maritime  and  Ports  Authority  of  Fiji\n(MPAF) and the Government as baseline data to enable objective project planning.\n\nB. \n\nBenefit Monitoring Evaluation Program and Measurement Indicators\n\n2.\nMPAF will undertake the (i) benchmarking identifying the current data for the proposed\nmeasurement  indicators,  (ii)  benefit  monitoring  involving  collection  of  indicator  data  one  year\nafter  the  completion  of  the  Project,  and  (iii)  postproject  benefit  evaluation  involving  collecting\nindicator  data  five  years  after  project  completion.  The  data  will  be  analyzed  and  the  findings\nsummarized  and  provided  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  proposed  benefit\nmonitoring  evaluation  and  measurement  indicators  shown  in  Table  A10  are  prepared  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation.\n\n3.\nMPAF  will  select,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  a  set  of  performance  indicators  and\nperformance  targets  to  monitor  the  benefits  of  the  Project  by  the  time  of  loan  inception.\nFinancial  performance  indicators  will  indicate  the  operating  revenues  under  the  heads  of\noperating expenditures to facilitate profit center calculations. Financial performance monitoring\nindicators  will  be  determined  under  the  associated  technical  assistance.  Data  on  vessel\nproductivity  to  be  collected  and  analyzed  by  MPAF,  supported  by  the  design  and  supervising\nconsultants,  will  comprise  turnaround  time  at  the  berths.  Data  on  cargo  handling  will  include\nrates  charged  for  different  products,  time  spent  for  unloading  and  loading,  data  on  equipment\navailability, and container-handling efficiency. MPAF will also monitor unquantifiable benefits of\nthe  sector  restructuring,  including  employment  creation  at  the  port  as  a  consequence  of  the\nrestructuring  process  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  measures  taken  to  improve  the  port\nenvironment.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10: Proposed Performance Measurement Indicators\n\nBenchmark\nProject\nCommencement\n\n1 Year after\nCompletion\n\n5 Years after\nCompletion\n\nDescription\n\nA.

MPAF  revalued  its  assets  in  1997  as  part  of  the  reorganization  of  the\nPorts Authority of Fiji. New asset values were prepared based on reinstatement and indemnity\nvalues for the assets. Adoption of the reinstatement values led to an increase in the fixed assets\nfrom  F$19.66  million  (US$10.22  million)  to  F$58  million,  or  US$30  million.  MPAF  prepaid  its\ndebt with the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank in 1996 and 1997\ncontributing together with staff redundancy payments to the accumulated losses.\n\nIncome Statement. Reorganization is accounted for in the financial statements of 1998\n3.\nand 1999. This separated cargo handling operations and the corresponding revenues and costs\nfrom MPAF to the Ports Terminal Ltd. Fees from the cargo operating license is collected.\n\nTraffic Volume. The Port Master Development Plan prepared a range of projections for\n4.\nlow,  medium,  and  high  traffic  growth.  The  low  projection  of  2.8  percent  per  annum  has  been\nused by MPAF in its planning and it has been used in the financial projections.\n\nTariff.  The  adopted  rate  increases  on  1  May  1999  yield  about  15  percent  increase  in\n5.\noverall revenue. These have been incorporated from the date of 1 May 1999. Tariff restructuring\nhas  been  incorporated  as  of  1  July  2001.  This  would  be  expected  to  yield  a  general  revenue\nincrease of 5 percent, which in light of reduced cargo throughput has not been realized in the\nrevenues.\n\nRecurring Expenses. Base year employment costs, and operations, maintenance, and\n\n6.\nadministration expenses have been escalated at 4 percent per annum.\n\n7.\nDepreciation  and  Fixed  Asset  Values.  MPAF  has  used  the  1997  net  values  for  the\nrevalued  fixed  assets  in  use.  These  have  also  been  used  for  the  asset  base  for  depreciation.\nThis base has been retained in the projections and a weighted average depreciation rate of 4.3\npercent per annum applied.\n\n8.\n\nIncome Tax. MPAF is liable for income tax on its profits at 35 percent.\n\nDividends.  The  policy  on  dividends  of  the  Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  remains\n\n9.\nunclear and flexible. No dividend payment has been assumed during the period of analysis.\n\n10. Working Capital. There are no inventories now that stevedoring has been transferred to\nthe  Ports  Terminal  Ltd.  Noncash  current  assets  and  liabilities  are  projected  as  steady\nproportions of revenue and purchased goods and services.\n\nLocal  Interest  Rates.  The  loan  from  the  ANZ  Bank  carries  7.0  percent  interest.  New\n\n11.\nborrowing of $14 million has been assumed at the same rate and repayable over five years.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nCapital  Works  Plan.  MPAF\u2019s  corporate  plan  gives  the  expected  capital  expenditure  in\n12.\naddition to the Project. Provision has been made for about one third of recent average annual\nexpenditure: $1.1 million per annum.\n\nB.\n\nDefinitions\n\n13.\nThe  operating  ratio  is  operating  expenses  (including  depreciation)  as  a  percentage  of\noperating  revenue.  The  debt-service  ratio  is  internal  cash  generation  (before  debt  service)\ndivided  by  debt-service  requirements.  The  self-financing  ratio  is  the  percent  of  capital\nexpenditures financed by MPAF after meeting operating expenses, debt service, and taxes over\nan average of three years.\n\n\fTable A11:

The  cargo  operations  at  its  King\u2019s  Wharf  are  carried  out  by  Port\nTerminal Services Limited (PTL). The Maritime and Ports Authority of Fiji (MPAF) is the landlord\nof the port facilities and administer policies and port regulations.\n\n2.\nConstruction  of  the  current  wharf  was  completed  in  1963.  The  wharf  has  since\nundergone  severe  damage  from  collision.  These  and  the  severe  tropical  marine  environment\nhave contributed to the early deterioration of the wharf. The Suva Port is currently degenerating\nwith  (i)  an  aged  wharf  apron  not  able  to  handle  the  current  cargo  requirements,  (ii)  wharf\nstructure and its land-fill below minimum seismic standards, and (iii) insufficient storage space.\nLife  expectancy  of  the  current  structure  has  been  estimated  to  2005.  MPAF  rehabilitate  the\nexisting  structure  to  increase  its  usable  life,  and  strengthen  the  wharf  to  accommodate\nanticipated traffic.\n\nNo  major  changes  are  proposed  in  the  port's  operations.  This  initial  environmental\n3.\nexamination  (IEE)  screens  the  possible  environmental  impacts  due  to  construction  works\nassociated  with  the  proposed  rehabilitation  Project  and  investigates  existing  operational\nimpacts.\n\n2.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n4.\nThe rehabilitation work for King\u2019s Wharf is estimated to take 34 months and will entail (i)\ncivil  works  for  maintenance  repairs  including  rebuilding  sides  of  longitudinal  beams  facing  the\nseabed,  restoring  fender  panels  and  their  supports,  rebuilding  the  southwest  corner  of  the\nwharf, and repairing all cracked piles and damaged bridge beams; (ii) civil works for establishing\na  minimum  seismic  standard  including  sheet  piles  and  rock  anchors;  (iii)  civil  works  for  wharf\ndeck strengthening including bridge beams, wharf edge beams, and wharf deck overlay; (iv) civil\nworks for reorientation of the container yard including regrading of pavements, moving of light\ntowers, removal of sheds 2 and 4, reinstatement of pavement in locations of sheds 2 and 4; and\n(v)  civil  works  for  ship-to-shore  sewerage.  The  following  main  activities  will  be  undertaken  to\nrehabilitate  King\u2019s  Wharf:  (i)  jack-hammering  and  chipping  off  deteriorating  concrete,  (ii)\nspraying on additional concrete, (iii) demolishing and reconstructing sections of the wharf, and\n(iv)  replacing  and/or  thickening  the  concrete  deck  slab.  The  concrete  replacement  work  will\ninvolve one or a combination of (i) microconcreting, (ii) spray concreting, (iii) concrete grouting\nof preformed structural members, and (iv) total reconstruction for small sections.\n\nThe Project will allow visiting ships to connect to the Suva sewerage line and dispose of\n\n5.\ntheir sewage directly into the Suva sewerage reticulation system.\n\n3.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nPhysical  Resources.  At  all  seasons,  the  predominant  winds  are  the  trade  winds  from\n6.\nthe east or southeast and are generally moderate. Average temperatures vary only 3(cid:176) C to 4(cid:176) C\nbetween  the  coldest  part  of  the  year  (July-August)  and  the  warmest  (January-February).  The\naverage rainfall on Viti Levu in the drier period averages 1,000-2,000 millimeter (mm), and in the\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nwetter  months,  1,800-2,600  mm.  The  marine  surface  current  flows  southwesterly  through  the\nislands.  Tidal  ranges  are  very  small,  neap  tides  having  a  mean  range  of  0.90  meters  (m)  and\nsprings  of  1.30  m.  King\u2019s  Wharf  is  within  a  second-generation  seismic  fault  zone,  a  structural\nmorphologic  overprinting  and  parallel  jointing  of  surfaces.  The  reactivation  of  the  faults  within\nthe  bedrock  and  slumping  of  the  overlying  sediments  were  partially  responsible  for  the  1953\nearthquake and tsunami. Several major earthquakes have been recorded, the most significant\nwere in Kadavu (1850) and Taveuni (1979), with another eight registered since 1850. The 1953\nSuva earthquake was the most destructive in Fiji\u2019s history.\n\n7.\nEcological  Resources.  The  current  estimate  of  mangrove  areas  in  the  Fiji  Islands  is\napproximately  45,000  hectares  (ha)  with  about  6  percent  converted  to  other  uses.  Reefs  are\nassociated with all the island groups. Many of the reef systems are extensive and complex, and\ninclude barrier, fringing, and platform reefs. Reefs at Suva bay entrance provide good shelter for\nthe harbor. Some mangrove stands are along the coastal line near to the harbor. These are in\ngood  condition.  Extensive  mangroves  are  found  across  the  bay.  Due  to  distance,  port\noperations  do  not  adversely  affect  the  mangrove  stands.  At  the  harbor,  water  showed  no\nindication of oil sheen or spills. The manufacturing industry in the Walu Bay area adjacent to the\nharbor  has  a  larger  contributory  impact  on  the  marine  ecosystem  than  operations  at  King\u2019s\nWharf.\n\nHuman  Economic  Development.  King\u2019s  Wharf  is  at  the  northern  end  of  the  capital\u2019s\n8.\ncentral business district. The Customs Department and other shipping/supplies companies are\nnear the port, as are the Suva bus station and the municipal markets. The area near the wharf is\nquite congested with traffic at peak hours. Residential areas next to the bus station and market\nare  about  1  kilometer  (km)  from  the  wharf.  At  the  northern  end  of  the  wharf  is  Walu  Bay.\nAdjacent to Walu Bay is a dedicated industrial area. Further north of King\u2019s Wharf is the Lami\nrubbish dump, which is built up on the foreshore area and serves the Suva and Lami areas. The\ndump does not have leacheate control systems or provision to protect the harbor waters from its\npollutants.  King\u2019s  Wharf  directly  and  indirectly  provides  employment  for  a  large  number  of\npeople. Any industry that imports and exports products from the Fiji Islands depends on King\u2019s\nWharf or Lautoka Port.\n\n4.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nPotential environmental impacts were screened using the Environmental Guidelines for\n9.\nSelected Infrastructure Projects of the Asian Development (ADB).  The  outcome  was  used  to\ndetermine  the  scope  of  works  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  port.  The\nscreening  process  found  no  significant  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  rehabilitation\nworks of King\u2019s Wharf.\n\nConstruction  Work.  The  construction  phase  will  have  localized  impacts  around  the\n\n10.\nwharf, concrete removal, and concrete repair.\n\n11.\nConcrete removal will create (i) concrete dust, (ii) spalls and debris, and (ii) noise. Jack-\nhammering  will  cause  large-  to  medium-size  pieces  of  concrete  to  fall  into  the  sea  under  the\nwharf. Due to the minimal quantity of the falling concrete, and because the sea floor under the\nwharf  consists  of  silts,  the  impact  on  the  marine  ecology  will  be  minimal.  Therefore,  special\nmitigation  measures  will  not  be  necessary.  The  quantity  of  dust  from  jack-hammering  is  not\nsignificant since the works will be done gradually. Most of the dust will float and/or be dissolved\ninto  the  sea.  The  airborne  dust  will  disperse  relatively  quickly.  However,  construction  workers\nmust  wear  protective  eyewear  and  disposable  dust  protection  mouth  pieces  during  all\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nconstruction  activities  below  the  wharf  deck.  These  requirements  will  be  stipulated  in  the\nconstruction  contract.  Noise  from  jack-hammering  of  concrete  will  be  too  far  away  from  any\nresidential areas, offices, or other social facilities to be considered significant. The construction\nworkers must use protective ear-muffs.\n\n12.\nConcrete repair work will involve (i) total repair of certain sections, (ii) sprayed concrete\nwork, (iii) micro concrete work, and (iv) grouting of performed concrete members. Environmental\nimpacts could arise from leaking of concrete products into the sea water in large quantities if, for\ninstance, a primary beam fails immediately following grouting. Similarly, in applying shotcreting\ntechniques,  inexperienced  handlers  could  unintentionally  spray  unacceptable  quantities  of  the\nconcrete product into the sea. To reduce the likelihood for such problems, strict quality control\nand  quality  assurance  measures  must  be  incorporated  the  construction  contract  and  all\nactivities  associated  with  the  construction  will  be  inspected  regularly  by  an  experienced\nsupervising engineer. The quality assurance or quality control program should be audited by the\nengineer to the contract on a regular basis.\n\nReorientation of the container yard will involve removal of two sheds, paving the area of\n13.\nthe two sheds, and moving a light tower and the power house. No additional land will be needed\nfor this activity. Dismantling the sheds will not cause significant environmental impacts. Paving\nwill  involve  concrete  removal  and  repair,  and  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impacts.\nInstalling the ship-to-shore sewerage line will not cause significant environmental impacts as it\nis a relatively small-scale activity.\n\n14.\nOperational  Phase.  Current  cargo  handling  operations  and  the  loading  and  unloading\nprocedures of containers and cargo will change. The anticipated traffic growth will also require\nincreased monitoring bilge water, ballast water, solid waste, and sewage disposal. To maintain\nand  enhance  the  environmental  quality  of  the  port,  MPAF  will  implement  a  clean  port\nmanagement  policy  during  the  project  construction  phase  and  operations  through  various\nmeasures.\n\n15.\nItems that need attention include (i) oil spills/leakage within the harbor that spread to the\nsea;  (ii)  oil  spills  from  tankers  on  their  way  to  or  from  harbor;  (iii)  inadequate  management  of\nwastes  from  ships;  (iv)  escape  of  oils  within  the  harbor;  and  (v)  adverse  effects  on  estuarine\nlagoons. Mitigation measures are suggested by the International Convention for the Prevention\nof Marine Pollution from Ships in 1973 (MARPOL 73/78). This was later modified by a Protocol\nin  1978.  MARPOL  73/78  is  a  legal  document  that  provides  guidelines  and  regulations  for  the\neffective control of port operations to minimize pollution and maximize safety/standards. The Fiji\nIslands is a signatory to MARPOL 73.78. Certain requirements of MARPOL 73/78 are reflected\nin the Port Authority of Fiji Act and the Marine Act. The following sections discuss some of the\nprovisions in MARPOL 73/78 that cover certain operational aspects and discuss ways in which\nsignificant environmental impacts can be mitigated during the operation of King\u2019s Wharf.\n\n16.\nPenalties.  The  maximum  fine  that  can  be  imposed  on  offenders  of  ports  regulations\nunder  the  Ports  Regulations  1990  is  F$400,  which  is  not  an  effective  deterrent.  The  costs  of\nenvironmental remedies can be considerably higher than the fine. Article 4 of MARPOL 73/78\nstates  that  penalties  must  be  adequate  in  severity  to  deter  violations  of  regulations.  MPAF  is\nrevising the policy to increase the fines (maximum F$50,000 to the owner/company, F$10,000\nto the captain, seizing the vessel, and prosecuting the offender). It is envisaged that revision of\nthe legislation will be brought about by June 2002.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nSewage Disposal. Facilities for the disposal of sewage are not currently provided to all\n17.\nships at King\u2019s Wharf. Shipping companies make their own arrangements for sewage disposal.\nMARPOL  73/78  states  that  the  Ports  Authority  should  provide  facilities  for  sewage  disposal.\nMARPOL  73/78  also  sets  out  the  requirements  for  the  discharging  of  sewage  at  sea  and  the\nequipment  that  is  required  by  ships  of  various  sizes.  To  maintain  the  environmental  quality  of\nthe  port  area  and  to  comply  with  MARPOL  requirements,  the  Project  will  provide  a  direct\nsewage  pipeline  from  the  ships  to  the  sewage  line  at  the  wharf.  The  sewage  line  will  be\nconnected  to  the  Suva  sewerage  system  and  subsequently  to  a  waste  water  treatment  plant.\nThe  present  capacity  of  the  sewage  treatment  plant  is  60,000  people,  and  is  planned  to  be\nupgraded.  The  total  capacity  after  upgrading  will  be  for  150,000  people.  The  Public  Works\nDepartment  indicated  that  additional  sewage  from  the  port  could  be  easily  accommodated  by\nthe treatment plant. Smaller local vessels deliver their sewage through mobile sewage collection\nvessel provided by the city council.\n\n18.\nBilge  Water.  Bilge  and  oily  water  at  Suva  Port  is  collected  by  a  private  company.\nMARPOL  73/78  specifies  that  nothing  except  clean  and  segregated  ballast  should  be\ndischarged within 50 nautical miles from land areas. The specific requirements for discharging\nbilge water vary from vessel to vessel, and depend on the ship type and the size. All ships will\nbe required to be surveyed and maintain certification, and an oil record book at all times.\n\nMost local ships will be under 400 gross tonnage. Under MARPOL 73/78, these vessels\n19.\ndo  not  require  surveys  or  certificates.  However,  they  will  be  required  to  adhere  to  off-shore\ndischarging  criteria.  For  ships  of  this  size,  MARPOL  73/78  recommends  that  they  (i)  have\napproved  oily-water  separating  or  oil  filter  equipment;  (ii)  have  a  holding  tank  to  retain  oily\nmixtures  and  oil  residues  on  board,  and  gutters  around  oil  appliances;  or  (iii)  where  these\nalternatives are not practicable, have simple oily water separating equipment. A number of local\nships  and  fishing  vessels  do  not  have  any  such  systems.  MPAF  will  set  a  phasing-in  period\nduring which boat operators can upgrade their vessels.\n\n20.\nSolid  Waste  Disposal.  Presently,  MPAF  provides  garbage  disposal  facilities  upon\nrequest. The garbage is then burned at the MPAF's incinerator. This service is mainly used by\nlarge ships. MPAF will provide garbage bins for the use of smaller vessels. This reduces the risk\nof rubbish being dumped into the harbor.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Programs\n\nEmergency Procedures. The Occupational Health, Safety, and Tower Control Section\n21.\nof  MPAF  has  a  checklist  of  procedures  and  safety  equipment  required  during  bunkering  and\ndischarging of petroleum products. Currently, there are no set procedures nor any equipment for\nan  environmental  emergency  such  as  a  large  oil  spill.  The  Fiji-based  petroleum  companies\n(Shell  Fiji  Limited,  B.P.  South  West  Pacific  Limited,  and  Mobil  Oil  Limited)  have  limited\nequipment  to  control  small  oil  spills  in  the  harbor.  MPAF  has  an  agreement  with  these\ncompanies to coordinate efforts if accidents happened. MPAF is also affiliated with the Pacific\nPorts  Association.  This  association  is  working  toward  developing  an  understanding  that  every\nport  in  the  Pacific  region  (including  New  Zealand  and  Australia)  would  come  to  the  aid  of\nanother  port  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  if  assistance  is  requested.  Thus,  well  equipped\nassistance  could  be  available  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  However,  to  enhance\npreparedness,  MPAF  will  procure  equipment  for  the  containment  and  dispersal  of  oil  spills.\nThese  comprise  flat  bottomed  aluminum  boats  with  outboard  motors,  approximately  100  m  of\ncontainment  boom,  oil  dispersant  and  spraying  equipment,  surface  skimmers,  and\ncommunication  equipment.  Environmental  personnel  will  be  trained,  and  the  number  of\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\npersonnel for environmental surveillance under the Occupational Health and Safety and Tower\nControl Section has been increased from 8 to 10 to enable 24-hour shifts. Initial discussion has\nbeen made with the port of Sydney, which will provide full support for such procurement and the\nneed of training.\n\n22.\nEnvironmental Impacts of Other Activities. Most of the water pollution at Suva Harbor\narea  is  a  result  of  land-based  point  sources  at  the  Walu  Bay  industrial  area  (21  industries).\nThese companies were surveyed and some of them (especially the food processing industries)\nwere found to have significant environmental impacts. A comprehensive monitoring program of\nthe  industries  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Public  Works  Department.  The  monetary  value  of\nenvironmental  fines  will  be  increased  to  act  as  a  deterrent  as  soon  as  the  sustainable\ndevelopment  bill  is  approved.  Under  the  Ports  Regulations  1990,  MPAF  is  responsible  for\nmonitoring the environmental health of the coastal areas and ports. Similar action will be taken\nfor the point source pollution from industries.\n\n6.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n23.\nEnvironmental  Impacts.  Based  on  the  screening  and  evaluation  of  environmental\nimpacts,  no  significant  environmental  impacts  were  identified  for  the  construction  associated\nwith  the  King's  Wharf  rehabilitation.  The  impacts  will  be  limited  (paras.  10-13).  Environmental\nimpacts  during  port  operation  can  be  mitigated  by  the  proper  implementation  of  revised  Port\nRegulations and MARPOL 73/78. Therefore, a detailed environmental impact assessment study\nis not warranted.\n\nMonitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  water  quality  will  be  undertaken  during  the  construction\n24.\nand  operational  phase  of  the  Project.  Through  coordination  by  the  concerned  agency,  e.g.,\nDepartment  of  Environment,  this  monitoring  program  can  be  extended  to  a  larger  area  of  the\nwharf  to  monitor  outflow  of  point  sources  pollution  from  Walu  Bay  industrial  area.  The\nforthcoming  environment  and  sustainable  development  bill  would  provide  an  effective\nmechanism to mitigate pollution in the Suva Harbor area.\n\n25.\nEmergency  Procedures  and  Monitoring.  An  action  plan  will  be  incorporated  into  the\nPorts  Regulations,  which  outlines  the  monitoring  procedures  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.\nLiaison  with  other  Pacific  ports  will  be  carried  out  to  determine  the  scope  of  assistance  and\nprocedures that would have to be undertaken to receive emergency services.\n\nPolicy  Requirements.  MARPOL  73/78  has  been  adopted  in  the  present  Port\n26.\nRegulation, 1990. The level of penalties will be adjusted from the current F$400 maximum fine\nto  a  level  that  will  deter  pollution  and  will  pay  for  all  costs  associated  with  environmental\nremedies in the event of a pollution incidence.\n\n27.\nEnforcement. MPAF can utilize the Sustainable Development Act and a stringent water\nquality  monitoring  program  to  enforce  its  Ports  Regulations,  1990  (or  subsequent  update\nlegislation) on point of source pollutants along the Suva foreshore including the industrial area\nof Walu Bay.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\n7.\n\nConclusion\n\n28.\nThis IEE concludes that significant environmental impacts are unlikely to result from the\nproposed  King\u2019s  Wharf  rehabilitation.  Potential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  will\nbe  within  acceptable  levels.  Nonetheless,  mitigation  measures  have  been  prepared  and\nworkers\u2019  safety  will  be  enforced.  Potential  environmental  impacts  during  port  operations  have\nbeen  identified  and  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  mitigation,  mitigation  measures  in\nAppendix 12 will be implemented. Therefore, the potential adverse environmental impacts of the\nProject during construction and the port operations thus can be mitigated to acceptable levels.\nThis IEE concludes that a detailed EIA is not warranted.\n\nB.\n\nLautoka Project Component\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\n29.\nLautoka Port is strategic to the Fiji Islands' economy as an alternative to the main port in\nSuva.  Lautoka  Port  is  on  the  northwestern  side  of  the  Fiji  Islands'  largest  island,  Viti  Levu,\napproximately 1 km from the center of Lautoka town. The port is Fiji Islands' second largest port,\nprincipally  catering  to  the  bulk  export  of  raw  and  semiprocessed  wood  chips  and  sugar.\nBecause  a  20-fold  increase  is  projected  by  2003  of  containerized  exports,  primarily  bottled\nwater and fodder, the port facilities must be expanded.1\n\n2.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nMPAF  has  commissioned  a  number  of  engineering  and  economic  investigations\n30.\nassessing  options  to  cater  for  the  projected  demand  on  port  facilities.  The  investigations\nrecommend\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nremedial  and  rehabilitation  works  on  Queen's  Wharf  to  improve  its  ability  to\naccommodate cargo-handling traffic;\nconstruction  of  an  access  bridge  (34x12  m)  between  the  southern  reclamation\nand Queen's Wharf to facilitate cargo movements to and from storage areas;\nconstruction  of  an  extension  (150x48  m)  to  Queen's  Wharf  to  cater  for  cargo\nvessels and international and local cruise vessels; and\nreclamation of 5.7 ha east of Queen's Wharf, primarily for container storage and\nindustrial  and  commercial  development,  and  including  a  new  road  and  a\nrecreational reserve.\n\n3.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n31.\nPhysical  Resources.  Lautoka  Port  is  on  the  northwest  side  of  Viti  Levu.  Its  tropical\nmaritime  climate  receives  light  to  moderate  winds,  mainly  local  sea  breezes,  temperatures  of\n18\u00b0C-32\u00b0C,  and  a  relatively  low  rainfall  of  2,000  mm/year.  The  rainy  season  is  November  to\nApril. In this period, the area is exposed to cyclones. The Port has a moderate tidal range of 0.9-\n1.5 m. The port is on the open coast, where tidal currents are minor. Under ambient conditions,\nthe  port  is  protected  from  ocean  swells  from  the  southwest  by  the  outer  barrier  reef  and  the\nYasawa Island chain. The in-shore water quality is degraded by pollution from industries a few\nmeters  east  of  the  area  for  reclamation.  The  combined  effects  of  the  good  tidal  flushing  and\nstrong  deepwater  currents  in  the  channels  have,  however,  helped  maintain  relatively  clean\nwaters  around  the  port.  The  Lautoka  area  sediments  are  basaltic  and  sand-size  volcanic\n\n1 Lautoka Port Development : Review of Master Planning, 2001, Sinclair Knight Merz.\n\n                  \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 13, page 7\n\nagglomerates and volcanogenic sediments. In places, muds, sands, and shells have deposited\nover  the  Ba  Group  bedrock  including  around  Queen's  Wharf.  This  is  overlain  by  recently\ndeposited,  very  soft,  marine  silty  clays  and  sands.  In  the  deeper  water,  the  upper  1-2  m  of\nrecent sediments are coarse to silty sand. The bedrock at the project site is sandstone including\nsoapstone, basaltic sandstone, volcanic sandstone, and altered rock. The tidal flats are edged\nwith a border of rocks moved onshore during cyclone.\n\n32.\nThe major ecosystem at the reclamation site is the foreshore area covered by 1-2 m of\nwater  at  high  tide,  but  exposed  during  low  tide.  The  area  is  ecologically  depleted.  The\nimpoverished intertidal flats and the foreshore are exposed to pollution from adjacent industries\nand  overexploitation  by  the  local  people.  Several  mangrove  trees  can  be  seen  from  the\nsubstrate,  but  appear  to  be  covered  in  mud,  and  may  not  survive.  The  dominant  fauna  is  the\nfiddler  crab,  Uca sp. Benthic  fauna  is  also  impoverished  as  a  result  of  cumulative  effects  of\npollution  from  the  land-based  industry.  Polychaete  worms  often  associated  with  anoxic\nconditions  dominated  the  benthic  fauna  of  the  area.  The  small  area  of  mangroves  at  the\nnortheastern  corner  of  the  area  to  be  reclaimed  comprises  20-30  trees.  Because  the  area  is\nsmall and trees are fairly short, fauna is not abundant or diverse. The biological breakdown of\norganic wastes from the industries and residential areas close to shore releases high levels of\nbiological  oxygen  demand  material  and  nutrients  into  the  water.  The  relatively  clean  waters\noffshore indicate the effective dilution and dispersion of these pollutants, as well as the filtering\ncapability  of  the  mangroves  around  Tava  Island.  Local  residents  sometimes  use  this  area  for\nline  fishing  at  high  tide.  MPAF  has  compensated  for  the  loss  of  fishing  by  the  residents  as  a\nresult of the Project.\n\nThe Sabeto River and its terrain have been previously used as borrow sources and are\n33.\nthe proposed borrow site for the Project. The landscape surrounding the river is dominated by\nsteep hills with forested summits, with some massive cliff faces. Beneath these, the landform is\nbroken  and  steep,  deeply  indented  by  numerous  small  streams  that  merge  into  larger  creeks\nand then form the Sabeto River. The river mouth has dense mangrove stands. The river valley\nhas  large  areas  under  sugarcane  cultivation.  The  riverbanks  and  valley  gullies  are  graced  by\nlarge  overhanging  rain  trees  with  secondary  regrowth  of  herbs  and  shrubs  forming  the\nundergrowth.\n\n34.\nHuman  Environment.  Lautoka's  urban  area  has  a  population  of  36,083.  The  land  in\nLautoka City is occupied by industry and manufacturing in the west of the port areas and, to a\nlesser extent, to the north of the city; the civic center with retail and government services is in\nthe north, and residential areas are in the eastern areas. Port activity is long established and,\nwith  the  sugar  industry,  has  been  the  main  factor  influencing  land  uses.  Industrial  and\nagricultural activities and employment rely on the port for export and are generally compatible\nwith the activities occurring at the port.\n\n4.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nPotential  environmental  impacts  were  screened  using  ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines\n35.\nfor  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  outcome  of  the  screening  process  was  used  to\ndetermine the mitigation action to be associated with the construction and operation of the port.\nThe  screening  process  found  that  no  significant  environmental  impacts  will  arise  from  the\nrehabilitation of Lautoka Port.\n\n36.\nConstruction Phase.  The construction is unlikely to cause environmental impacts, but\nslight  impacts  that  may  arise  must  be  mitigated.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 13, page 8\n\nwill  include  a  schedule  of  detailed  activities  to  implement  mitigation  measures  including\nmonitoring.  Most  potential  environmental  effects  from  construction,  including  water  quality,\ntraffic,  and  dust,  can  be  mitigated  by  sound  construction  practices  and  management  and\nmonitoring.  The  EMP  for  construction  will  be  implemented  by  the  contractor  as  a  contract\nrequirement, and be monitored by MPAF supported by the project management consultants.\n\n37.\nThe  extension  of  the  Queens  Wharf  by  150  m  northward  is  not  expected  to  cause\nsignificant ecological impact because no coral reefs are in the affected area. The location of the\naccess-bridge  rules  out  any  significant  environmental  impact.  Because  the  affected  area  is\nwithin the existing port area, no new threats to the environment or marine ecosystems will arise.\nThe sites of the wharf extension and the access bridge are not accessible for fishing due to the\nport activities. The reclamation will have impacts on the ecology, except for the destruction of a\nsmall  stand  of  mangroves  on  the  northeastern  corner  of  the  area  to  be  reclaimed.  If  these\nmangroves  are  destroyed,  MPAF  will  require  the  contractor  to  replant  mangrove  seedlings  in\nnearby areas to compensate for the loss.\n\nOperational Phase. The potential environmental and social effects of the Project can be\n38.\nmitigated by appropriate operational procedures. Procedures to satisfactorily mitigate the effects\nwill be identified. MPAF will prepare practical operational plans for the management of the port\nand port access traffic, and a hazardous materials spill contingency plan. MPAF will also require\noil  and  chemical  companies  to  review  their  handling,  storage,  and  emergency  procedures\nregularly,  to  provide  training  to  their  workers  and  any  MPAF  workers  involved  in  oil  and\nchemical handling, and to ensure that the companies have sufficient spill response equipment at\nthe  port.  These  procedures  will  be  documented  and  reviewed  regularly,  and \ntheir\nimplementation  via  training  and  workplace  practice  monitored  by  MPAF.  The  EMP  is  a  key\nbenefit of the Project.\n\n5.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n39.\nNo  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  during  the  construction  work  at\nLautoka  Port.  All  identified  impacts  are  minor  and  can  be  satisfactorily  mitigated.  Therefore,  a\ndetailed environmental impact assessment study is not warranted.\n\n40.\nMPAF  will  prepare  an  EMP  and  establish  practical  procedures  to  mitigate  impacts  of\nincreased port operations. The Project-related mitigation measures could improve current conditions\nat the port and the EMP will mitigate effects of the proposed expansion.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\n41.\nSignificant  environmental  impacts  are  unlikely  to  occur  as  a  result  of  the  proposed\nLautoka Port activities. The impacts that do occur can be mitigated (paras. 36-37). The Lautoka\nPort mitigating procedures is in Appendix 12.\n\n7.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\na.\n\nInstitutional Aspects\n\n42.\nThe  Department  of  Environment  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Housing  and\nEnvironment  is  currently  reviewing  the  Sustainable  Development  bill  of  1999.  The  draft  bill  is\nexpected  to  receive  Parliament\u2019s  consideration  during  2002.  The  draft  bill  covers  environment\nimpact  assessment  and  management  of  development  projects,  and  provision  for  controlling,\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 9\n\nregulating,  and  policing  the  release  of  wastes  from  industry.  Once  the  bill  is  approved  by\nParliament, enforcement of the environmental requirement is legally binding. The Department of\nEnvironment will be the coordinating body in cross-sectoral environmental issues.\n\nMPAF's  Occupational  Health,  Safety,  and  Tower  Control  Section  is  responsible  for\n43.\nsurveillance of the port operations, including monitoring discharges from ships at the wharf and\ncarrying  out  other  environmental  checks  on  operations  at  the  ports.  Fire  and  emergency  drills\nand safety training is carried out by the Occupational Health, Safety, and Tower Control Section.\nTo enhance surveillance of the port operation and to ensure the implementation of Clean Port\nManagement Policy, MPAF, has employed 2 additional personnel giving it a total of 10. Thus,\n12-hour shifts with 2 people per shift have been put in place, and the section can undertake 24\nhour  surveillance.  This  has  enhanced  the  capacity  of  the  section  to  police  and  monitor  port\noperations.\n\n8.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring\n\nMonitoring will ensure that environmental impacts of the Project will be minimized. The\n44.\ntwo major monitoring phases are during construction and during operation of the port, and are\nconsidered within MPAF's capability.\n\nConstruction.  No  major  environmental  impacts  are  expected  from  construction.\n45.\nWorkers  will  use  protective  eyewear,  disposable  dust  protection  mouth  pieces,  and  ear-muffs\nand an experienced supervising engineer will carry out strict, regular inspections of all activities\nassociated  with  the  construction  works.  A  monitoring  program  on  water  quality  will  be\nundertaken under the EMP prior to and during construction. The results of these tests can then\nbe compared with similar tests, undertaken at fixed intervals (as determined by the water quality\nengineer)  during  construction.  If  water  quality  tests  show  that  acceptable  limits  have  been\nbreached, construction will be halted to allow the particulates to disperse.\n\n46.\nOperation. Continued environmental surveillance during port operation under the control\nof  Pollution  of  the  Port  Regulations,  1990  (or  forthcoming  updated  Regulation)  will  include  (i)\nsewage discharge; (ii) garbage disposal; (iii) ballast water disposal; (iv) disposal of oily, galley,\nbathroom, and laundry wastes; (v) contaminated tank washings or cargo washings; (vi) disposal\nof  bilge  water  containing  oil;  (vii)  ship  accidents;  (viii)  accidental  release  of  undesirable\nsubstances;  (ix)  discharge  of  refuse;  and  (x)  disposal  of  putrefying  or  objectionable  matter\n(rubbish, corrosive substances, and dead plants and animals). Water quality will be monitored\nregularly  to  determine  the  long-term  impact  of  port  operations  on  the  marine  environment\n(especially on turbidity, pathogenics, and heavy metals).\n\n9.\n\nEducation\n\n47.\nMPAF  will  engage  in  public  awareness  and  education  programs.  These  programs  will\ninform the general public, especially children, of the value of the ocean and ports, and educate\nthem  on  the  role  the  public  can  play  in  preserving  the  cleanliness  and  vitality  of  the  marine\nenvironment.\n\n\fSUVA PORT THROUGHPUT\n(tons)\n\nDescription\n\nActual\n\nForecast\n\nAAGR Base Year

15, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nA.\n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\nAlternative designs were considered for each project component: (i) the wharf rehabilitation,\n1.\nseismic strengthening, and capacity improvements for King\u2019s Wharf, Suva; and (ii) Queen\u2019s Wharf,\nLautoka extension and reclamation. These were contrasted with capacity, cost, demand forecast,\nand  ship  service  time  considerations.  Least  cost  technical  solutions  have  been  identified  by\ncomparing costs and benefits of mutually exclusive project options.\n\nB.\n\nRationale\n\nKing's  Wharf  Component.  The  rationale  for  the  component  arises  from  the  least  cost\n2.\nanalysis. Under the master plan, relocation of Suva Port was proposed to a site 5 kilometers (km)\nfrom its current location by 2005. The construction was to commence in 2000 and permit transfer of\nport  and  cargo  operations  to  the  new  facility  by  2005.  The  current  facility  will  sustain  the  current\ncargo throughput until 2005 with the support of additional recurrent maintenance. Beyond this date,\nthe  wharf  will  require  increasing  maintenance  and  expenditure.  The  commissioning  of  the  new\nfacility was to correspond with the end of the structural life of the current facility. The relocation was\nestimated  to  cost  F$120  million  in  1997.  However,  a  geotechnical  study  conducted  in  1998\nconcluded that due to the extent of the required reclamation and the quality of the submarine soils,\nthe cost estimates would nearly double. This estimate was prepared for the least cost option for the\nport relocation, namely the dredge option. The scope includes (i) dredging the reclamation area, (ii)\nbunding and installing rock armors, (iii) bunding the core material, (iv) bunding the core material to\nquarried rock, (v) paving, and (vi) reinstating all buildings and access roads.\n\n3.\nIn light of the increased and currently unaffordable costs of relocating the port, the Maritime\nand  Ports  Authority  of  Fiji  (MPAF)  sought  to  attain  the  greatest  use  of  its  existing  Suva  Port\nfacilities. A program of deferred maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and seismic strengthening was\nprepared  to  extend  the  life  of  King\u2019s  Wharf  by  15  years,  to  2020.  The  proposed  rehabilitation,\ntogether with the container handling and yard performance improvements, will enable King\u2019s Wharf\nto handle the anticipated throughput to 2020.\n\n4.\nThe  selected  seismic  strengthening  option  was  furthermore  contrasted  with  a  full  seismic\nupgrade of the King\u2019s Wharf complex covering the Walu Bay berth and the three berths of King\u2019s\nWharf.  While  the  seismic  strengthening  needs  to  be  adequately  extensive  to  protect  the\nreclamation,  the  container  yard,  and  berths  used  most  frequently,  costs  of  a  full  seismic  upgrade\nwere estimated at F$42 million. The least cost seismic rehabilitation option of the northern section\nof Kings Wharf has been adopted for the Project.\n\nTo improve cargo handling operations, complementary institutional changes are required to\n5.\nthe physical improvements including opening of cargo handling at both Suva and Lautoka ports to\nprivate sector competition. At present, vessel operators apply a surcharge of F$150 per container\nto freight rates into and out of the Fiji Islands to compensate for delays in vessel turnaround time\ncaused by the slow rates of cargo handling. Together with the physical improvements to the wharf\nunder  the  Project,  increase  in  competition  is  expected  to  improve  cargo  handling  performance,\nwhich is expected to be passed on to shippers through elimination of this surcharge.\n\nLautoka  Port  Component.  The  rationale  for  the  Lautoka  Port  component  is  a  least  cost\n6.\nsolution  to  provide  adequate  length  for  concurrent  berthing  of  dry  bulk  cargo  vessels  and  large\ncontainer vessels. As presently constructed, when a bulk sugar or wood chip carrier occupies the\nsouthern Fiji Sugar Corporation berth it also occupies part of the west berth of Queen\u2019s Wharf, and\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nan incoming container vessel might then have to wait, or the bulk vessel will have to be temporarily\nshifted. The new facility will provide unobstructed berthage for one large (250 m) or two small (120\nm)  vessels  on  the  west  berth  of  Queen\u2019s  Wharf,  and  an  additional  shallower  draft  berth  on  east\nberth of Queen\u2019s Wharf.\n\n7.\nSignificant new trade through Lautoka is the export of bottled water to north America. This\nindustry  was  established  in  1996,  and  is  rapidly  expanding  through  a  modern  bottling  plant  at\nRakiraki, north Viti Levu. The firm is implementing its plans to double production by early 2002, and\ncould double again in subsequent years. Its business is well capitalized and has already developed\na  substantial  market  through  diversified  distributors  in  the  United  States  and  an  effective\nadvertising  campaign.  The  export  water  is  presently  transported  by  road  from  the  plant  to  Suva,\nwhich  is  both  costly  and  unacceptable  on  environmental  and  social  grounds  due  to  the  limited\ncapacity  of  Queen\u2019s  Road  and  the  numerous  villages  and  towns  along  the  route.  The  production\nrate of the firm will result in a container truck every 8 minutes along the primary road link between\nRakiraki, Lautoka, and Suva.The impact of heavy axle loads are damaging the road system, and\nthe  Land Transport Authority  is  reducing axle load limits to 16.8 tons from the current load of 24\ntons.  The  new  regulations  will  have  cost  implications  for  carriers  and  inland  road  transport.\nConstruction of the wharf extension will allow this trade to be shipped directly from Lautoka Wharf\neliminating  at  least  220  km  of  inland  transport.  Transport  to  Lautoka  would  be  by  road  or  barge.\nPort storage and wharf requirements and MPAF\u2019s revenues would be unaffected in either case.\n\n8.\nA  number  of  other  export  trades  based  in  northern  Viti  Levu  are  at  a  planning  or  trial\nshipment  stage  including  container  shipment  of  compacted  fodder  (animal  feed)  crops  to  the\nMiddle  East,  and  other  possibilities  such  as  foodstuffs  and  building  products.  The  market\ncompetitiveness of these products will depend on delivered (cargo, insurance, freight) price, which\nmakes  the  distance  to  a  suitable  export  port  and  efficient  port  handling  critical  in  determining\nviability  of  these  new  economic  and  trading  activities.  Once  established,  the  port  extensions  will\nencourage the establishment of such export industries and reduce the costs of imported goods.\n\nC.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nA  separate  financial  and  economic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  for  each  project\n\n9.\ncomponent. The financial analysis is summarized in Table A15.1.\n\n10.\nSuva  Port.  The  financial  analysis  for  King\u2019s  Wharf  is  based  on  with-  and  without-project\ncomparison. The analysis considers the relevant incremental costs of civil works and maintenance.\nThe financial calculations are based on 2001 constant prices including taxes, duties, and physical\ncontingencies.  They  exclude  price  contingencies  and  financing  costs.  The  cost  estimates  are\nprepared using conservative standards. In particular, for the seismic analysis, high cost estimates\nare used to sensitize these to the changes that may arise from the detailed designs. The costs of\ndirect operation and maintenance of King\u2019s Wharf are adopted from the financial forecast of MPAF.\nThe with-project case reflects no incremental maintenance during construction. Under the without-\nproject case, the port operator is maintaining the facility to meet the current and anticipated loads\nuntil  2005,  with  the  maintenance  effort  necessarily  consuming  increasing  resources  due  to  the\ndeteriorating condition of the wharf. A physical contingency of 10 percent has been used for each\nphysical  project  component,  except  the  container  yard  reorganization,  which  have  received\nphysical contingencies of 5 percent. A 15 percent physical contingency has been calculated for the\nconsulting services.\n\n11.\nUnder  the  with-  and  without-project  comparison,  the  revenues  include  ship  revenues\ncalculated  with  the  current  tariff  at  current  values.  A  growth  of  traffic  volume  is  assumed  in\naccordance with the low growth case of 2.3 percent per annum. Without the project, traffic growth will\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nbe  affected  by  reducing  serviceability  of  the  wharf  structure,  and  a  lower  rate  of  1.0  percent  is\nassumed until 2005, then static growth and eventually slow decline as the wharf reaches the end of\nits operable life. This decline is due to the increasing costs of shipping through King's Wharf arising\nfrom increasing limitations on wharf loading and the possible need to restrict the working berth length\nand  have  areas  periodically  shut  off  for  repair  work.  The  increasing  inefficiency  and  costs  of  sea\ntransport  make  export  goods  less  competitive  and  imported  goods  more  expensive,  dampening\nnational  economic  growth  and  overall  transport  demand,  and  increasing  a  tendency  for  shipping\ncompanies \nimprovements  and\naccompanying  freeing  up  of  competition,  the  port  will  be  able  to  improve  ship  turnaround  time,\nreduce costs, and allow the growth target of 2.3 percent to be met.\n\nto  avoid  Suva  where  possible.  With \n\nthe  project  physical \n\n12.\nWithout the project there is an annual risk of earthquake damage costs to the wharf of F$0.22\nmillion (tables A15.2 and A15.3) which would have to be met by MPAF and which would be averted\nwith the Project. This is shown as a cost to MPAF in the without-project case, the annual cost being\nthe probability of occurrence multiplied by the cost of repairs.\n\nA  financial  net  present  value  is  a  measure  of  financial  benefit  accruing  to  MPAF  at  the\n13.\ndiscount rate of 12 percent. The financial internal rate of return equalizes the present values of cost\nand benefit streams. It is estimated to be 22.3 percent for the Project, with F$17.7 million net present\nvalue for 12 percent discount rate.\n\n14.\nLautoka  Port.  The  financial  analysis  for  Lautoka  Wharf  extension  (Table  A15.4)  and  the\ncontainer  yard  reclamation  is  also  based  on  a  with-  and  without-project  comparison.  Without  the\nProject, the newly developing export trade in bottled water is expected to continue to be shipped by\nroad to Suva, bearing high inland transport costs, and the future expansion of this trade would be\nconstrained  as  a  result.  The  export  of  animal  feed  (compacted  Rhodes  grass  and  cane  leaves)\nwould  be  compromised  by  the  failure  to  provide  adequate  facilities  at  Lautoka,  and  this  trade  is\nassumed not to proceed in the without-project case. Other generated traffic would not occur, and\nthere would be no transfer between road transport of inward freight from Suva Port to Lautoka Port\nas volumes would be insufficient to induce ship calls. With the Project, the base case assumes that\nthe new trades would develop as projected by their stakeholders.\n\nUnder  the  base  projection,  container  cargo  exports  through  Lautoka  would  increase  by\n15.\n10,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 2003 on the opening of the new wharf, exceed 65,000\nTEU  in  2010,  when  the  trade  is  fully  developed  as  projected  by  the  industry  stakeholders.  The\ncontainer projections are based on continuation of an existing trade of 4,300 TEU per year, bottled\nwater trade rising to export 17,500 TEU per year on a fortnightly liner service, fodder crops rising to\n40,000  TEU  per  year  on  a  weekly  charter  service,  other  new  trades  contributing  2,000  TEU  per\nyear, and 2,600 TEU per year transferring from Suva. There would also be empty container imports\nto  balance  the  export  traffic,  although  the  growth  in  the  transport  of  these  would  be  less  than\nexports as the Fiji Islands has a surplus of empty containers due to the existing trade flows.\n\n16. With  the  Project,  it  is  assumed  that  new  trades  will  develop  as  projected  by  their\nstakeholders. The Project is estimated to achieve a financial internal rate of return of 16.5 percent\nwith a F$8.1 million net present value at 12 percent discount rate.\n\nD.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nCorrespondingly,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  equalizes  the  present  values  of\n17.\neconomic costs and benefits that accrue to the national economy. An economic net present value\nof the Project reflects return in excess of the discount rate of 12 percent. Economic values for costs\nand  benefits  are  obtained  by  extracting  taxes  and  duties,  and  by  applying  a  conversion  factor  to\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nlabor,  local  materials,  and  locally  produced  benefits  to  reflect  their  value  in  external  terms.  Local\ncomponents are adjusted to their border values using a standard conversion factor of 0.986 and a\nlabor conversion factor of 0.86 calculated for the Fiji Islands. The conversion factors are applied to\nthe  maintenance  costs,  as  local  materials  and  labor  will  be  used  for  to  carry  out  works.  The\neconomic  analyses  for  each  project  component  are  calculated  separately  based  on  with-  and\nwithout-project comparisons.\n\n18. \nSuva Port. For King\u2019s Wharf, the economic benefits (Table A15.5) comprise returns to cargo\nshippers of cargo in the form of savings in handling charges. At present a F$150 surcharge per TEU\nis  added  to  the  normal  freight  rate  to  recover  costs  to  vessel  operators  from  cargo  handling\ninefficiencies. The seismic strengthening confers a benefit from the averted damage cost should an\nearthquake occur, expressed as the expected value of damage multiplied by the annual probability of\noccurrence. For King\u2019s Wharf, an economic internal rate of return of 15.8 percent has been obtained\nwith a net present value of F$5.0 million for a discount rate of 12 percent.\n\n19.\nAn additional separate economic analysis has been prepared to estimate the real costs of\nearthquake  damage  if  an  earthquake  occurred  the  year  after  construction  is  completed.  Project\nbenefit-cost  ratios  are  calculated  for  each  earthquake  intensity  measured  by  ground  acceleration\non the basis of a probability of 1.00. Replacement of the facility is assessed at F$62 million based\non MPAF\u2019s asset revaluation.1 Probabilities of an earthquake at various intensities were determined\nbased  on  the  MPAF\u2019s  geotechnical  study2  and  data  obtained  from  the  South  Pacific  Applied\nGeoscience  Commission.  The  damage  ratio  before  mitigation  and  after  mitigation  is  the  cost  of\ndamage  divided  by  replacement  cost.  Damage  ratios  were  assigned  to  each  level  of  earthquake\nintensity.  For  each  earthquake  level,  the  benefits  of  mitigation  are  calculated  and  divided  by  the\ncost  of  the  seismic  strengthening  component,  estimated  in  economic  terms  at  F$7.2  million.  The\nresults show that the strengthening is rational and that the chosen strengthening option is the most\ncost effective.\n\nLautoka Port. Economic benefits of the Lautoka Port component (Table A15.6) arise from\n20.\nthe (i) reduction in transport costs of the existing cargo traffic through the port instead of through\nthe  road  system,  (ii)  cost  savings  to  existing  container  traffic  through  improved  cargo  handling\nefficiency,  and  (iii)  savings  to  the  new  cargo  loads  made  viable  by  the  new  logistics  systems\nprovided by the additional Lautoka Port facilities.\n\n21.\nTransport cost savings include efficiencies in port cargo handling, reduced ship delay, and\nreduced internal transport costs where maritime transport substitutes for land transport connection\nto  maritime  transport.  Ship  delay  savings  accrue  to  the  shipping  operator,  and  are  only  partially\nreturned  to  the  Fiji  economy.  For  locally  owned  shipping  companies  and  single  commodity\ncharters,  the  contract  between  shipper  and  shipping  company  would  be  expected  to  take\nadvantage of the transport cost savings.\n\n22.\nSavings  also  accrue  from  the  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  and  reduced  road\ndeterioration,  which  have  been  estimated  through  axle  loads  applied  to  the  road  system  by  the\nincremental traffic expected to transfer to direct shipping of containers from Lautoka to destination\nports without transit to Suva by road.\n\nAn  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  17.6  percent  has  been  obtained,  and  a  net  profit\n\n23.\nvalue of F$9.8 million based on a discount rate of 12 percent.\n\n                                                          \n1 MPAF. Port Asset Revaluation. Beca, 1997\n2 MPAF. Rokobili Geotechnical Study. Tonkin and Taylor, 1997\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 15, page 5\n\nThe  economic  analysis  shows  both  components,  Suva  and  Lautoka,  to  be  viable  in\n24.\neconomic  terms.  More  risk  is  associated  with  the  Lautoka  port  due  to  its  reliance  on  newly\ndeveloping  trades.  However,  discussions  with  the  project  proponents  and  shipping  companies,\ndetermination  of  commercial  commitments  made,  and  inspection  of  production  plant  give  good\nreason  to  expect  that  projections  of  new  trade  will  be  realized.
