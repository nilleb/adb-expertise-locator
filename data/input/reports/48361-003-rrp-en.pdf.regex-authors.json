THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for subprogram 3 of the Building Macroeconomic Resilience \nProgram. \n \n2.  The program, consisting of three subprograms, aims to strengthen Tonga\u2019s long-term \ngrowth prospects and capacity to respond to external shocks. It supports government efforts to \nimprove (i) its fiscal position by adopting prudent policies and better public financial management \n(PFM); and (ii) the business climate by continuing policy, regulatory, and public enterprise reforms. \nSubprogram 3 is the final subprogram, and builds on progress under two earlier subprograms of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners approved in fiscal year (FY) \n2016 and FY2017. 1 The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priority of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development  constraints.  Tonga  faces  challenges  to  macroeconomic  resilience \nbecause  of  geographic  disadvantages,  exposure  to  shocks,  and  internal  bottlenecks.  The \npopulation of 108,000 is dispersed across 36 of Tonga\u2019s 172 islands, with about a quarter of the \npopulation based in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. Small size and remoteness increase the cost of \nproviding services, limit competitiveness, and reduce economies of scale. Institutional capacity is \na challenge, with a small cadre of qualified public servants implementing several government \nfunctions. Legislative, cultural, and social barriers limit women\u2019s labor force participation and \neconomic empowerment. \n \n4.  Although the fiscal position has improved since the global economic crisis, Tonga remains \nheavily dependent on external assistance.3 Frequent external shocks such as substantial crop \nand infrastructure damage from Cyclone Ian in 2014, Cyclone Winston in 2016, and Cyclone Gita \nin 2018 jeopardize fiscal sustainability. Procurement and financial management capacity and \nsystems are improving, but need further strengthening. Tonga\u2019s business environment is stronger \nthan that of most Pacific developing countries,4 but the private sector faces several constraints \n(footnote 3) and foreign investment is about 2%\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP). While the \ncommercial returns of Tonga\u2019s state-owned enterprise (SOE) portfolio have improved since \nFY2009,  performance  is  still  volatile  and  can  be  further  improved  through  reforms  to  the \ngovernance and ownership structure of individual SOEs.5 \n \n5.  Recent macroeconomic performance. Economic growth, which is highly volatile, is \ndriven largely by the public sector. Tonga\u2019s GDP grew 1.9% on average during FY2009\u2013FY2018, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business \nPlan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2019\u20132021. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. \nManila.

In FY2018, Cyclone Gita caused \ndamages of about $164.3 million (36% of GDP), and the economy is estimated to have \nexpanded by only 0.4%. Recovery and reconstruction are expected to drive growth during \nFY2019\u2013FY2021, with the economy projected to grow at an annual average rate of about 2.0%. \n \n6.  Tonga\u2019s fiscal stance has generally been prudent, helped by increasing grants. Public \nexpenditure  prioritization  and  strong  domestic  revenue  performance saw  the  overall  deficit \n(including grants) shrink from 1.3% of GDP in FY2013 to a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY2017 \n(Table 1). Higher tax rates on petroleum products and unhealthy foods (partly offset by tax \nreductions on healthy alternatives) contributed to domestic revenue, and the tax\u2013GDP ratio rose \nfrom 17.0% in FY2013 to 21.1% in FY2018. Public expenditure also increased from 26.5% of \nGDP in FY2013 to 42.8% in FY2018, in response to reconstruction needs following periodic \ncyclones; investments in key maritime, transport, and energy infrastructure; and increases in \nwages for civil servants amid frequent pressure for pay increases and cost-of-living adjustments.6 \n \n7.  Despite reconstruction needs after Cyclone Gita, delays in scaling up public spending \nresulted in a fiscal surplus of 1.6% of GDP in FY2018. The government exercised control on \ncapital spending by freezing various sports- and leisure-related investments. Small fiscal deficits \nare  projected  during  FY2019\u2013FY2021  as  capital  expenditure  resulting  from  reconstruction \nincreases. A new remuneration structure introduced in FY2017 is expected to stabilize longer-\nterm wage growth, after an initial cost of transitioning to the new structure in FY2018\u2013FY2019.  \n \nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2016\u2013FY2021 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018e  FY2019p  FY2020p  FY2021p \nTotal revenue and grants  40.6  42.5  44.4  51.9  50.3  47.1 \n  Total revenue  30.4  29.3  29.7  29.9  29.7  29.9 \n       of which: tax revenue  20.6  21.0  21.1  22.9  21.9  21.7 \n  Grants  10.2  13.2  14.7  22.0  20.6  17.2 \nTotal expenditure  41.1  40.4  42.8  53.0  51.3  47.6 \n  Current expenditure  31.8  29.9  33.2  36.3  34.2  31.2 \n       of which: wages and salaries  12.1  11.3  12.1  13.1  12.5  12.0 \n       Capital expenditure  9.3  10.5  9.6  16.7  17.1  16.4 \nOverall balance, including grants  (0.4)  2.1  1.6  (1.2)  (1.1)  (0.5) \n     ($ million)  (1.6)  9.5  7.2  (5.6)  (5.3)  (2.5) \nOverall balance, excluding grants  (10.6)  (11.1)  (13.1)  (23.2)  (21.7)  (17.7) \n     ($ million)  (42.8)  (50.2)  (59.0)  (107.6)  (105.3)  (89.5) \nExternal debt  43.7  39.5  41.8  40.9  40.2  39.9 \nGDP ($ million, current prices)  403.7  452.0  450.2  463.8  485.3  505.4 \n( ) = negative, e = estimates, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Government of Tonga, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. \n \n8.  Tonga\u2019s medium-term external debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to remain stable, although its \nexternal debt distress rating changed from moderate to high risk in 2017 as the debt sustainability \nanalysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) incorporated the effects of potential natural \ndisasters into the methodology.7 The government has successfully avoided non-concessional \nexternal borrowing consistent with its debt strategy adopted under subprogram 1,8 and external \ndebt is well below 50% of GDP, which is the threshold established under subprogram 2.

In 2018, ADB and the World Bank moved to 100% grants for \nTonga, which helps mitigate fiscal risks.9 The recent 5-year extension of the grace period on two \nexternal loans has also reduced medium-term fiscal pressures.10  \n \n9.  Recent political developments. Tonga underwent political changes after the approval of \nsubprogram 2 in FY2017. In August 2017, the King dissolved the Parliament more than a year \nbefore the end of its term. In the November 2017 national elections, the incumbent party was \nreturned  to  power  with  an  expanded  majority  in  Parliament.  These  developments  were \naccompanied by several changes in the administration, including at the ministerial level.  \n \n10.  ADB contributions. ADB has supported government reforms through budget support and \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve Tonga\u2019s fiscal performance and business environment. ADB \ndisbursed budget support for Tonga in FY2010, FY2014, FY2016, and FY2017 to address \ndevelopment financing needs and provide incentives for implementation. Earlier policy-based \noperations backed the government\u2019s tax mobilization measures, which led to rapid domestic \nrevenue growth (para. 6). Reforms have addressed civil service performance management, \nintroduced a new debt management law and transparent fiscal targets to support medium-term \nfiscal  sustainability,  implemented  a  procurement  tracking  database,  and  supported  better \nprocedures to follow up on audit recommendations (including preparing new biannual reports on \naudit recommendations and actions). Advisory services provided by ADB through the Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative11 helped the government strengthen corporate governance \npractices, improve the SOE monitoring framework, implement skills-based SOE director selection, \ncommercialize selected SOEs, and approve a foreign investment bill (footnote 8). Progressive \nimplementation of reforms has improved the performance of the SOE portfolio.12 \n \n11.  Lessons learned. Subprogram 3 reflects several lessons from previous budget support \noperations, including that (i) budget support can achieve results if there is strong government \nownership; (ii) a programmatic engagement backed by sustained policy dialogue is an important \nmeans to advance policy reforms; (iii) close coordination with development partners is critical to \nprogress reforms in sectors where ADB has limited engagement; and (iv) TA support, coordinated \nacross development partners and provided parallel to budget support programs, can help push \nthe  reform  agenda.  Another  key  lesson  is  that  a  3-year  program  can  involve  significant \nimplementation challenges, given high rates of turnover (both within the civil service and at the \nministerial level) and Tonga\u2019s exposure to disruptive external shocks. These challenges became \nevident in the current program, originally expected to be implemented over FY2016\u2013FY2018, \nunder which reform priorities were initially established with the authorities in 2015. Since then, a \nchange in administration in 2017, followed by a major natural disaster in 2018, have affected \nprogress in some reform areas. Subprogram 3 has highlighted the importance of flexibility in \nadjusting the reforms to ensure that policy actions remain relevant and informed by the latest \nevidence and conditions. \n                                                \n9  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants is determined by its risk of debt distress. Since Tonga is at \nhigh risk of debt distress, it is eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants.  \n10 The two loans from the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, signed in FY2009 and FY2010, are valued at $70 million and \n$45 million. Instead of FY2019\u2013FY2024 and FY2020\u2013FY2025, the principal repayment periods for each loan will now \nbe FY2024\u2013FY2029 and FY2025\u2013FY2030 respectively. \n11 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase III. Manila. \n12 Following a decrease in the return on equity of Tonga\u2019s SOE portfolio from about 5.6% in FY2006 to 0.1% in FY2009, \nADB-supported measures helped increase the return to 4.0% in FY2016, based on latest available data (footnote 5). \n ", "4 \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  Government reforms. Tonga has adopted a vision for \u201ca more progressive Tonga \nsupporting a higher quality of life for all,\u201d following the Tonga Strategic Development Framework \n(TSDF), 2015\u20132025.13 This vision is translated into five pillars: economic institutions, social \ninstitutions, political institutions, infrastructure and technology, and environment. The TSDF \nemphasizes sustainability, good governance, shared prosperity, and gender equality. \n \n13.  Partner  coordination.  Since  2011,  the  government  has  prioritized  and  sequenced \nreforms  through  the  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM)  process,  which  brings  together  key \nministries and development partners to map out critical constraints, design policy and TA solutions, \nmonitor reform implementation, and mobilize financial assistance.14 ADB, the governments of \nAustralia and New Zealand, the European Union, and the World Bank coordinate their budget \nsupport and/or TA operations through the JPRM process. The IMF has provided an assessment \nletter for the grant.15 \n \n14.  Programmatic approach. ADB\u2019s Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program supports \ngovernment reforms through three subprograms, originally envisaged for FY2016\u2013FY2018.16 The \nprogrammatic design allows for reform sequencing across multiple areas to account for Tonga\u2019s \nlimited implementation capacity, while providing flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities \nand  constraints.  ADB  developed  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  in  consultation  with  the \ngovernment and other development partners, and in alignment with national priorities. All the \npolicy actions set out under subprograms 1 and 2 were completed in FY2016 and FY2017,17 and \nsupported reforms focused on fiscal consolidation, PFM, and improving the business environment. \n \n15.  Following Cyclone Gita, which hit Tonga on 12\u201313 February 2018, the government\u2019s focus \nshifted to response, recovery, and reconstruction. To meet the government\u2019s revised priorities in \nthe aftermath of the cyclone, ADB disbursed $6.0 million in disaster-contingent financing on \n16 February 2018 from ADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program.18 On 22 February, ADB \nprovided an additional $1 million under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund for humanitarian \nrelief  efforts.  Subsequently,  in  June  2018,  ADB  approved  a  $6.8  million  grant  for  the \nreconstruction and upgrade of electricity network infrastructure damaged by the cyclone.19 \n \n16.  Although the reform momentum was interrupted in FY2018, continuation of the program \nis appropriate given the progress achieved under the first two subprograms, the need to focus on \nimplementation, the new government\u2019s commitment to the JPRM, and the importance of budget \nsupport.  Under  subprogram  2,  nine  indicative  triggers  for  subprogram  3  were  identified \n(footnote 17), in line with government priorities and capacity.

Two indicative triggers were dropped from subprogram 3 as they are only feasible \nin the medium term because of delays arising from exogenous factors and issues around partner \nTA mobilization.20 A new indicative trigger was added, reflecting revised priorities. Eight prior \nactions were finalized for subprogram 3. The program will close on 30 June 2019. \n \n17.  Program description. The program aligns with the following TSDF impacts: (i) more \ninclusive and sustainable growth and development; (ii) a more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic \nknowledge-based economy; and (iii) more responsive good governance (footnote 13). The effect \nof the reforms will be an improved fiscal position and business environment in Tonga. Eight prior \nactions under three reform areas have been completed under subprogram 3 (Appendix 4). ADB \nhas added value through TA support for five prior actions, as outlined below. \n \n18.  Reform area 1: Fiscal resilience. Policy actions completed under subprograms 1 and 2 \nincluded measures to strengthen tax revenue mobilization (primarily taxes on unhealthy foods) \nand develop a fiscal strategy with medium-term targets for debt, revenue, and public service wage \naffordability. The government conducted a civil service remuneration review under subprogram 1. \nBased on this review, under subprogram 2, the government introduced a new public service salary \nstructure with a revised pay scale for fair and appropriate remuneration, along with a performance \nmanagement system (PMS) for competitive and fair performance assessments as a basis for in-\ngrade pay progression rather than automatic increments for public officials starting in 2018. \n(i)  Tax administration. Since 80% of Tonga\u2019s tax revenues come from consumption \nand trade taxes, maximizing the efficiency of tax and customs administration is \ncrucial. As a subprogram 3 prior action, the cabinet approved a revised revenue \nservices administration bill that introduces additional avenues for revenue recovery \nand  sets  updated  and  graduated  penalties  to  incentivize  compliance.21 The \nlegislation obligates taxpayers to apply for a tax identification number, which is \nexpected to improve compliance management. As another subprogram 3 prior \naction, the cabinet approved a new customs bill that ensures that national rules \nare  consistent  with  key  international  standards  (including  the  Revised  Kyoto \nConvention  and  World  Customs  Organization  recommended  practices)  and \nimproves  customs  administration.  The  reforms  will  standardize  and  simplify \ndeclaration  procedures  and  supporting  documentation,  clarify  principles  for \ncustoms  valuation  of  imported  goods,  and  enhance  the  predictability  and \ntransparency of customs actions. They will also reduce documentary compliance \ncosts by facilitating the online access and lodgment of documents, payments, and \ncustoms  clearance.  These  bills  will  be  implemented  following  Parliamentary \napproval expected in 2019, and implementation regulations are under preparation. \n(ii)  Civil service reforms. The public sector wage bill, about 56% of FY2018 domestic \nrevenue, remains a major fiscal challenge. To continue reforms in this area, the \ngovernment requested an assessment of PMS implementation introduced under \nsubprogram 2. A review was undertaken through ADB TA.22 While commending \nthe Public Service Commission for undertaking potentially contentious reforms in \na very competent manner, the review made 17 recommendations to strengthen \n                                                \n20 Indicative Triggers and Policy Actions Accomplished for Subprogram 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2) summarizes the changes in the policy actions for subprogram 3. \n21 Penalties related to tax administration (i.e., registration, late lodgment and payment, false or misleading statements, \nand dishonored checks) and tax offences (i.e., failure to maintain proper records, fraud, and obstruction) are clearly \ndefined, and graduated penalties (i.e., where the penalty increases, depending on the severity and/or length of time \nof the infraction) have been introduced for several offences to encourage compliance. \n22 ADB. 2013.

As a \nsubprogram 3 prior action, the Public Service Commission implemented three key \nrecommendations: (a) realignment of the PMS year to de-link it from the peak \nperiods of activity in the budget cycle, ensuring that management and staff have \nsufficient time to complete the performance assessment process adequately; \n(b) provision of target performance rating distributions to ministries to reduce the \nneed  for  substantial  moderation  by  the  Oversight  Moderation  Committee  of \nperformance  ratings  heavily  skewed  toward  the  highest  ratings;  and \n(c) clarification of eligibility for performance rewards and procedures for managing \npoor performance. \n  \n19.  Reform area 2: An inclusive, modern, and accountable state. Policy actions under \nsubprogram  1  included  the  approval  of  new  public  procurement  regulations  and  PFM \nimprovements,  such  as  audit  follow-up  procedures  (footnote  8).  A  procurement  database \nintroduced under subprogram 2 established an institutional mechanism to enable the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) to maintain a detailed record of all procurements above the small item threshold \n(T$7,500) and to monitor key performance indicators on procurement, which can help the MOF \nidentify bottlenecks in the procurement process. An  independent  regulator  with  powers to \nregulate communication services was also established under subprogram 1. \n(i)  Financial management. As a subprogram 3 prior action, the MOF has removed \nthe noneconomic items from the economic segment of the chart of accounts (COA), \nwhich will improve the accuracy of budget reporting. A comprehensive economic \nsegment is critical to the government\u2019s reporting requirements\u2014classifying items \nas revenues, expenditures, assets, or liabilities, and assigning these into standard \ncategories such as salaries, goods and services, and capital investment. In Tonga, \nthe integrity of the economic segment had been compromised by the inclusion of \nnoneconomic  concepts,  e.g.,  items  related  to  projects,  programs,  funds,  or \nactivities  (such  as  spending  for  national  celebrations),  undermining  the \neffectiveness of budget controls and presenting risks of inaccurate or misclassified \ninformation. The IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre supported \nthe removal  of  noneconomic  items from  the COA. In  parallel,  ADB and  the \nGovernment of Australia are providing TA for the upgrade of Tonga\u2019s financial \nmanagement information system (footnote 22), with the addition of new modules \nfor aid information, project management, budget preparation, and forecasting, \nwhich will be impacted by changes to the COA. Further revisions to the COA will \nbe implemented concurrently with the finalization of the financial management \ninformation system upgrade in 2019 to ensure compatibility. \n(ii)  Labor market regulations. A policy objective under the program is to improve the \nfunctioning of the labor market, which can in turn promote inclusive growth. Tonga \nlacked  labor  regulation in  the  private  sector to  ensure many  standard  basic \nprotections,  including  rights  to  leave  from  work,  nondiscrimination,  and  fair \ndismissal.  The  absence  of  flexible  work  arrangements  and  maternity  leave \nentitlements affected women disproportionately. As a subprogram 3 prior action, \nthe  cabinet  approved  for  submission  to  Parliament  a  landmark  employment \nrelations bill (ERB), which will ensure basic labor protections and reduce gender \ndisparities at work. This legislation, prepared with assistance from the International \nLabour Organization, has been widely consulted with stakeholders over more than \nfive years. It reflects key issues and priorities from consultations with women and \nwomen\u2019s organizations and includes a new entitlement for maternity leave, as well \nas legislative backing for new fundamental rights such as equal pay for equal work, \nfreedom of association, and prohibition of forced labor. \n ", "7 \n20.  Reform area 3: A more dynamic and inclusive economy. Business environment \nreforms under subprograms 1 and 2 included public enterprise governance improvements, and \nsteps toward the commercialization of Tonga Water Board, Tonga Cable Limited, and Tonga \nCommunications Corporation. Under subprogram 2, the cabinet approved a foreign investment \nbill to attract foreign investment. Progressive implementation of government initiatives has helped \nincrease the profitability of the SOE portfolio (footnote 5). \n(i)  Foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Act was passed by Parliament in \n2019 after extensive consultation, reflecting work ongoing since 2013 with ADB \nsupport (footnote 11). Replacing the 2002 Foreign Investment Act, the new act \n(a) clarifies the definition of foreign investment, (b) provides clearer principles for \nreviewing reserved and restricted activities, and (c) sets out a more transparent \nframework for screening foreign investment applications. As a subprogram 3 prior \naction, the cabinet approved revised foreign investment regulations,23 subject to \nformal enactment of the 2019 Foreign Investment Act.24 The new regulations will \nhelp ensure that the foreign investment registration process is simpler, streamlined, \nand clearer about information requirements. \n(ii)  Public enterprises. Subprogram 3 continued successful reforms to improve the \nfinancial  viability  of  selected  SOEs.  Currently,  stevedoring  (cargo  handling) \nactivities at Nuku\u2019alofa port are fragmented, with three private stevedores aligned \nto separate shipping lines but drawing on the same small labor pool, providing \nship-to-shore  handling  of  cargo.  Ports  Authority  Tonga  (PAT)  provides  the \nremaining functions to facilitate container transport to the terminal gate. A review \nconducted  with  ADB TA  (footnote 11)  noted  that  a  single  operator  providing \nseamless  cargo  handling  services  from  ship  to  terminal  gate  would  lead  to \nefficiency  gains  in  port  operations,  and  allow  greater  incentives  to  invest  in \nequipment and staff. As a subprogram 3 prior action, the cabinet approved that \nPAT will issue a concession contract for all cargo handling activities at Nuku\u2019alofa \nport to be provided by a single private sector operator, with PAT acting as the port \nlandlord. PAT will no longer incur ongoing operation and maintenance costs \nassociated with cargo handling, while collecting a concession fee from the private \noperator. PAT will issue a competitive tender for a concession contract to provide \nstevedoring and related services at the port. The 28 PAT employees potentially \naffected by the transition have been offered the option of employment with the new \nconcessionaire  or  a  redundancy  package,  limiting  employment  impacts.  The \nMinistry of Public Enterprises, with ADB support, aims to sign a concession \nagreement with a private company in 2019. \n(iii)  Private  sector  development.  As  a  subprogram  3  prior  action,  the  cabinet \napproved a private sector development strategy, 25 setting out a prioritized and \nsequenced list of gender-sensitive reforms\u2014addressing the business environment, \nmarket competition, access to finance, targeted business development, and public \nenterprises. The strategy was prepared with ADB support (footnote 11), with input \nfrom  women  and  women\u2019s  organizations.  It  includes  recommendations  that \naddress the challenges faced by women, such as measures to improve access to \nfinance  and  financial  literacy;  support  tourism-related  industries,  which  are \ndominated by women; and create more employment opportunities for women by \n                                                \n23 Regulations include processes, templates, and instructions for (i) registration as a foreign investor; (ii) reissuance, \nreinstatement, or transfer of registration; (iii) submission of annual reports; and (iv) cessation of business activity. A \nlist of reserved and restricted activities is also part of the regulations. \n24 Enactment follows assent by the King of Tonga, which will formally bring the 2019 Foreign Investment Act into effect. \n25 This action was originally part of subprogram 1, but was postponed because the limited development partner TA \nresources were re-prioritized to support other reforms.  \n ", "8 \ncontracting out government services such as home health care. The strategy also \naddresses the needs of disabled and young people in training and employment. \n \n21.  Reform area 4: Effective response to disasters. The program originally included a \nreform area for effective disaster response. Subprogram 1 supported a response plan to Cyclone \nWinston. This reform area was not part of subprograms 2 and 3, and ADB\u2019s support for disaster \nresilience reforms is provided outside of the program framework (footnote 18). \n  \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n22.  Subprogram 3 reforms build on good progress under the two earlier subprograms to \nstrengthen Tonga\u2019s macroeconomic resilience and ability to respond to economic shocks. Under \nreform area 1 (para. 18), more efficient customs administration and indirect tax collection will \nfurther enhance domestic revenue mobilization (including through better compliance),26 and a \ndeclining wage bill in the medium term will improve the fiscal position. These reforms can help \nbuild fiscal space to respond to economic shocks and disasters, and promote long-term growth. \nEnvisaged  reform  impacts  also  include  allocative  efficiency  gains  from  the  rebalancing  of \nexpenditure  to  priority  areas.  Under  reform  area  2  (para.  19),  financial  management \nimprovements will help the government to monitor budget spending and strengthen internal \ncontrols more systematically. Under reform area 3 (para. 20), clarity about foreign investment \nregistration  requirements  will  reduce  uncertainty  about  application  review  and  screening, \nencouraging foreign investors. More efficient SOEs will lead to less demand for government fiscal \nsupport. Implementation of the private sector development strategy will improve the business \nenvironment, which will help create more jobs and promote growth. \n  \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n23.  Excluding grants, the fiscal deficit in FY2019 is estimated to be $107.6 million (23.2% of \nGDP). FY2019 grants are estimated to total $102.0 million, of which $15.5 million is through the \nJPRM. Of this amount, ADB is expected to contribute $5.0 million. JPRM budget support grants \nalso include $2.2 million from the European Union, $2.8 million from the Government of Australia, \nand $5.5 million from the World Bank, as parallel collaborative partner financing not administered \nby ADB.27 JPRM budget support will finance 14.4% of the FY2019 projected fiscal deficit. \n \n24.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance subprogram 3. The grant proceeds \nwill support development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.28  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The existing institutional structure for aid management in Tonga will be used to implement \nand monitor the policy actions supported by the program. The MOF will be the executing agency. \nThe government\u2019s Budget Support Management Committee, which leads the JPRM process, \noversees the program. Through the committee, the MOF will provide overall guidance and \nassume responsibility for coordinating program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation as the \n                                                \n26 Reforms under the program helped raise the tax\u2013GDP ratio in Tonga to an estimated 21.1% in FY2018, higher than \nthe Pacific average of 18.1% (Table 1). \n27 The World Bank\u2019s policy matrix for its parallel Third Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, expected to be \napproved in May 2019, supports seven of the eight prior actions in ADB\u2019s subprogram 3 policy matrix. The action on \ncabinet approval of the private sector development strategy (para. 20) appears only in the ADB matrix. \n28 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nexecuting agency. The Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, the Ministry of Public \nEnterprises, the Ministry of Revenue and Customs, the Public Service Commission, and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office are the implementing agencies. The JPRM process will continue to facilitate \nbroad consultations on reform priorities. Government authorities have consulted on individual \nreform  initiatives,  with  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  as  needed.29 Subprogram  3  is \nimplemented from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2019, extended by a year because of external events \n(para. 11). The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, following \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  Governance. Promoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is \nimplementing its PFM reform road map, FY2015\u2013FY2019, to close the gaps identified through \ntwo PFM assessments.30 Despite capacity limitations, the assessments indicate that, compared \nwith international best practice, Tonga\u2019s PFM system is mostly operating at average levels. The \ngovernment has the ability to implement its budget but there are procurement, accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and auditing weaknesses (footnote 3). This program, complemented by \ndevelopment partner TA (para. 19 and footnote 8), addresses many of those weaknesses. Tonga \nhas taken steps to strengthen anticorruption measures, including by creating the Parliament \nStanding Committee on Anti-Corruption in 2015. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the MOF and the government. \n \n27.  Poverty and social. The public sector is a key provider of services to low-income \nhouseholds, and reform area 1 will help ensure that the government has the fiscal resources to \nrespond to future economic shocks and natural disasters (which tend to have an adverse effect \non the poor) while maintaining critical public services. Reform area 2 will improve work conditions \nfor all employees, to the extent that basic labor rights are protected by law once the ERB is \nenacted. The ERB provides the legal framework to establish minimum wages in the future, which \ncould have negative employment consequences. However, the ERB also stipulates that any \nminimum  wage  must  be  endorsed  by  representatives  from  the  government,  employers\u2019 \norganizations, workers\u2019 associations, and the Forum of Directors of Education. Given such \nmitigating measures, the ERB is considered supportive of vulnerable groups by protecting basic \nlabor rights and protections that are already standard in many countries. Reform area 3 will \nimprove the environment for private sector activity, which will help create more jobs in Tonga. \n \n28.  Gender. Subprogram 3 is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and includes \nproactive gender actions that will address a number of constraints to women\u2019s labor force \nparticipation and economic empowerment. The ERB (para. 19) addresses key legislative barriers \nto women\u2019s employment by providing new fundamental rights for women in the labor market. New \nprovisions for flexible work arrangements and maternity leave entitlements will support women\u2019s \nadvancement in the workplace; and ensure that women returning from maternity leave face no \nloss of wages, benefits, or seniority. In addition, legislation on freedom from discrimination and \nequal  remuneration  for  equal  work  will  help  to  address  wage  discrimination  and  sexual \nharassment in the workplace. The approval of the private sector development strategy (para. 20) \nwill lead to concrete steps to improve women\u2019s participation in the private sector, including \nmeasures to improve access to finance and financial literacy; employment opportunities for \n                                                \n29 Extensive consultations have been undertaken around foreign investment legislation, the ERB, and the private sector \ndevelopment strategy. \n30 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability. 2010.

Safeguards.  Following ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  3  is \nclassified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms.

Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 Development partners assess that \nPFM systems can support mostly reliable services for budget support.

The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  grant  document.

The JPRM is a living document that is updated based on government priorities and \nthe reform context. The JPRM guides the overall reforms undertaken by the government. Not all actions in the JPRM \nare prior policy actions for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s budget support operations. However, the policy actions in \nsubprogram 3 are a subset of the JPRM actions. \nc  The employment relations bill includes a new entitlement for maternity leave; provisions for equal pay for equal work, \nflexible  working,  freedom  of  association,  and  prohibition  of  forced  labor;  and  legislation  on  freedom  from \ndiscrimination and harassment in the workplace. \nd  The private sector development strategy includes recommendations to (i) review women\u2019s constraints to land tenure, \n(ii) improve women\u2019s access to finance and financial literacy programs, and (iii) increase employment opportunities \nfor women in the service industry. \ne  Development partners support several policy reforms across all three reform areas, which are necessary to reach \nthe outcome, as outlined in the JPRM (footnote 14 of the main text).
