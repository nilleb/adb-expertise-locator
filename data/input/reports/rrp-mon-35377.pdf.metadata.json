The corridor will link the Asian \nhighway  networks  of  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation \n(Russia)  and  passes  through  major  economic  centers  of \nMongolia.  The  Project  also  includes  (i)  a  cross-border  road \ntransport facilitation plan, (ii) road safety improvement, (iii) area \ndevelopment  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the \nProject,  and  (iv)  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  awareness  and \nprevention of HIV/AIDS1 and human trafficking on the north-south \nroad corridor. \n   \nRationale  The Project will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s transport links to the PRC \nand Russia as well as to other countries in the region through the \nport of Tianjin in the PRC. As part of the Asian highway network, \nthe project road will serve as an important route for domestic and \ninternational  transit  traffic.  The  Project  will  also  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth  in  the  aimags  (province)  of \nDornogovi and Govisumber in southern Mongolia by improving \nlocal  communities\u2019  access  to  markets,  job  and  business \nopportunities, and social services. The Government has accorded \nhigh priority to the Project, which is supportive of the objective of \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Mongolia and is consistent with its \nefforts for promoting regional cooperation. \n   \n                                                 \n1  AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \n ", "iv   \nObjective  The goal of the Project is to promote regional cooperation and \nsustainable  economic  growth  in  Mongolia.  The  purpose  is  to \nincrease the efficiency and safety of domestic and international \ntransit traffic between the PRC and Russia through Mongolia\u2019s \nnorth-south road transport corridor. The Project comprises five \ncomponents: \n \n  (i)  construction of 428 kilometers (km) of a two-lane, asphalt  \n  concrete  road  between  Choyr  and  the  PRC  border  in \n  Zamyn-Uud  \n \n  (ii)  implementation of a cross-border road transport facilitation \n  plan \n \n  (iii) improvement of road safety \n \n  (iv) implementation  of  an  area  development  program  that \n  includes (a) constructing four access roads totaling about \n  34  km  to  connect  Erdene,  Orgon,  and  Saynshand; \n  (b) establishing a pilot roadside station; (c) training local \n  laborers  on  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and \n  (d) enhancing stakeholder participation \n \n  (v)  technical  assistance  for  awareness  and  prevention  of \n  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the north-south road \n  corridor \n   \nCost Estimates  The  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $78.1  million  equivalent, \ncomprising $52.8 million (67.6%) in foreign exchange and $25.3 \nmillion equivalent (32.4%) in local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency \nAsian Development  31.6  5.5  37.1  47.5 \n  Bank   \nRepublic of Korea  18.0  5.9  23.9  30.6 \n  Government \nPeople\u2019s Republic of  1.2  0.3  1.5  1.9 \n  China Government \nMongolian Government  2.0  13.6  15.6  20.0 \n    Total  52.8  25.3  78.1  100.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR25,505,000  ($37.13  million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources to help finance the \nProject. The proposed loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n ", "  v\n   \nEstimated Project  31 July 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Roads (DOR) \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC), comprising representatives of \nArrangements  concerned central government agencies and local governments, \nwill be established to supervise project implementation. The PSC \nwill meet at least once every 6 months and ADB will participate as \nobserver. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up within \nDOR to take responsibility for implementation activities on a day-\nto-day basis. The PIU will be headed by a project director, who \nwill be assisted by two full-time project managers and a team of \nqualified  technical,  financial,  and  administrative  staff  during \nproject implementation. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the project road \n(including  the  access  roads  to  Saynshand  and  vegetation \nplanting) and the access road to Orgon will follow international \ncompetitive bidding procedures or relevant bilateral agreements. \nBecause the civil works contracts will cost less than $1 million and \ndomestic contractors are capable of undertaking such works, at \nthe Government\u2019s request local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB will be followed for civil works for the access \nroad  to  Erdene  and  the  provision  of  safety  features  on  the \nAltanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section.  Patrol  vehicles,  two-way \ncommunication  radios,  and  the  vehicle  weight  mat  will  be \nprocured following direct purchase or local competitive bidding \nprocedures. \n \nAdvance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  was  approved  on \n14 April 2004. \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  1,158  person-months  of  consulting  services  (177.5 \ninternational and 980.5 domestic) will help implement the Project. \nConsultants  will  undertake  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision,  strengthen  project  management,  improve  road \nsafety, assist in implementing the area development plan and the \ncross-border road transport facilitation plan, and help monitor and \nevaluate project impacts. The Government will finance consulting \nservices for detailed design, while ADB will finance the remaining \nconsulting services. ADB-financed consultants will be recruited \naccording  to  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  of \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n   ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit the people living along the road corridor in \nBeneficiaries  Mongolia  (about  48,400  based  on  the  2003  population),  road \ntransport operators and users, construction companies, traders, \nand other people who derive income from expanded traffic, trade, \nand investment in the region. The major benefits will be in the \nform  of  improved  trade  and  transit,  and  significantly  reduced \ntransaction costs among the PRC, Mongolia, Russia, and other \ntrading  partners.  Major  direct  benefits  will  be  lower  transport \ncosts, faster and more reliable road transport services, and job \nand income opportunities created during project implementation \n(i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) or along the \nproject road after project completion. The Project is expected to \ncreate about 1,800 jobs on road construction and maintenance, \nand  income  amounting  to  MNT3.4  billion  ($2.9  million)  for \nMongolians. The Project\u2019s economic internal return is estimated at \n29.7%.  Indirect  benefits  will  be  increased  business  and  job \nopportunities  in  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  which  have \nbackward or forward linkages to the Project. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has three potential risks. First, implementation may \nbe  delayed  due  to  DOR\u2019s  limited  experience  in  managing \nconstruction of a relatively long road. This risk will be mitigated by \nprovision of consulting services and advance procurement action. \nSecond, counterpart funds may not be provided on a timely basis. \nADB  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  that \nsufficient  counterpart  funds  for  the  Project  are  allocated  in  a \ntimely  manner.  Third,  maintenance  of  the  project  road  after \ncompletion  may  be  inadequate  due  to  insufficient  funding. \nThis risk will be mitigated mainly through the establishment of a \nfacility in Zamyn-Uud to collect vehicles fees beginning in 2009, \nwith  fee  revenues  to  be  allocated  to  the  Road  Fund  for \nmaintaining the project road. The fee revenues will be sufficient to \ncover the annual maintenance cost of the project road to ensure \nsustainability. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The proposed TA for $350,000 equivalent, to be financed from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program on a grant basis, will accompany the \nloan to create public awareness and take preventive measures to \nreduce the risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking \non the north-south road corridor.  \n   \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project (the Project). The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS1 and Human \nTrafficking, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES2 \n2.  The Project will develop the remaining section of Mongolia\u2019s north-south road transport \ncorridor between Choyr and the border with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Zamyn-\nUud. The Project is classified as a regional project for the following reasons. First, the corridor \nconstitutes a part of the Asian highway network (Route 3)3 linking the road systems of the PRC \nand the Russian Federation (Russia) and passing through major economic centers of Mongolia. \nSecond, regional traffic (i.e., traffic from or to Mongolia and transit traffic via Mongolia) is \nprojected to account for about 75% of total corridor traffic during 2009\u22122025; therefore the \ncorridor will serve as an important route for domestic and international transit traffic, promoting \ntrade and reducing transaction costs among countries in the region. Third, the Project will \ncomplement ongoing negotiations on the draft Transit Traffic Framework Agreement among the \nPRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  which  are  expected  to  be  concluded  soon.4  The  Mongolian \nGovernment has accorded the Project high priority and has sought assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s road sector is underdeveloped and is unable to fulfill its objective of fostering \neconomic and social development. A detailed road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. The main \nfeatures of the sector are summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  The country has a road network of about 49,250 kilometers (km), comprising \n11,063 km of state roads and 38,187 km of local roads. Only 12% of the roads \n(1,670 km) are paved, 13% (1,800 km) are gravel, and 75% are earth roads. \nRoad density (0.03 km per km2) and the share of paved roads (3.4%) are low. \n \n(ii)  Road transport carries only about 3% of freight in ton-kilometers (TKM) and less \nthan 20% of passengers in passenger-kilometers (PKM). \n \n(iii)  Registered vehicles (private vehicles in particular) increased rapidly by about 6% \nper annum during 1994\u20132003 due to economic recovery and progress on the \ntransition to a market-based system. In 2003 Mongolia had 138,307 registered \nvehicles with a ratio of 45.5 vehicles per 1,000 persons, which was close to the \n                                                 \n1  AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \n2  A project preparatory technical assistance was provided to prepare the feasibility study on this project. \n3  The concept of the Asian highway network that the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific has been promoting took a significant step forward when 31 regional countries including Mongolia \nsigned in April 2004 in Shanghai, PRC an agreement on the network\u2019s development. \n4  The PRC, Mongolia, and Russia began negotiations on the draft Transit Traffic Framework Agreement in 2000 with \nassistance from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Five negotiating meetings have been \nheld. ADB participated in the Fifth Negotiating Meeting in Qingdao, PRC on 14\u221215 January 2004. \n ", "2    \nmid value in the world.5 Registered vehicles in the project area were 3,137 in \n2003, with a ratio of 64.8 vehicles per 1,000 persons. The rapid increase in \nvehicle  ownership,  which  is  projected  to  continue  in  the  foreseeable  future, \nhighlights the potential growth of road transport and requires expansion and \nimprovement of the road network. \n \n(iv)  Road sector funding through the Road Fund6 has been inadequate, ranging from \n45 to 79% of the amount needed by the Department of Roads (DOR). Funding \nfor road maintenance is even limited, accounting for about 25% of the amount \nrequested  by  DOR  and  less  than  0.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nInadequate road sector funding leads to deterioration of the road network and will \nnot meet the needs of the reviving economy. \n \n(v)  Road  accidents  have  risen  significantly  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  the  total \nnumber growing from 860 in 1995 to 5,553 in 2002. The fatality rate in 2002 was \n24 persons per 10,000 vehicles, higher than in many other Asian countries.7 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  The key problem in Mongolia\u2019s road sector is underdevelopment of the road network, \neven taking into account the country\u2019s low population density. Road density (0.03 km per km2) \nand the share of paved roads (3.4%) in Mongolia are both close to the low end of the countries \nin  the  world.8  The  share  of  freight  transport  by  road  is  also  lowest  among  the  transition \neconomies of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.9 Moreover, many \npaved and gravel roads are deteriorating and a large proportion remains impassable during the \nrainy or winter seasons due to inadequate maintenance. \n \n5.  The  main  constraint  to  development  of  the  road  sector  is  inadequate  funding  (an \nassessment of the road sector financial management is in Appendix 2). A World Bank study \nnotes that for capital investment and maintenance, Mongolia\u2019s road sector requires a minimum \nannual funding equivalent to 2.4% of GDP during 1999\u22122014.10 The Road Fund has failed to \nreceive adequate revenues needed for the road sector, and actual road sector funding during \n1999\u22122003 accounted for less than 1% of GDP. Allocation for road maintenance has been \ninadequate, despite some improvement in recent years. The share of funds allocated for road \nmaintenance (less than 0.2% of GDP) in Mongolia is lower than in many other Asian countries.11 \nFiscal deficits of the Government (3.6% of GDP in 2003) and a high external debt (103.7% of \nGDP in 2003) are the primary factors limiting government funding for the road sector. Lack of an \nupdated sector strategy exacerbates the problem because the Government sometimes fails to \nallocate limited financial resources to priority projects on the basis of the country\u2019s development \nstrategy and sound technical and economic analyses. \n                                                 \n5  The mid value in the world was 45.8 vehicles per 1,000 persons. World Bank (web site). What Does the Average \nRoad Sector Look Like? Washington, DC. \n6  The Road Fund established in 1991 and administered by the Department of Roads provides funding for the road \nsector. \n7  For example, the road accident fatality rate in the PRC for 2001 was 17 persons per 10,000 vehicles. \n8  The mid-range values of road density and the share of paved roads in the world are 0.2 km per km2 and 45.5%, \nrespectively (footnote 5). \n9  World Bank. 2000. World Development Report. Washington, DC. \n10 World  Bank.  1999.  Taming  the  Tyrannies  of  Distance  and  Isolation:  A  Transport  Strategy  for  Mongolia. \nWashington, DC. \n11 For example, the share of road maintenance expenses to GDP was 1% in the PRC, 0.7% in Viet Nam, and 0.5% in \nKazakhstan in the early to mid-1990s (footnote 10). \n ", "    3 \n6.  Government funding for the road sector will likely remain inadequate over the medium \nterm, given the continued fiscal deficits. The potential of private financing to develop road \ninfrastructure is also limited, because the large capital investment requirements for developing \nroad  infrastructure  are  generally  beyond  the  private  sector\u2019s  present  capacity  to  mobilize \nresources. Hence,  there  is  justification  for external  aid  sources  including  ADB  to  continue \nassistance to the road sector of Mongolia, including financial support for the Project. The Project \nwill develop the road infrastructure between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud and will \nhave important implications for the following aspects. \n \n7.  Access to World Markets. As a large landlocked country, Mongolia depends on its two \nneighbors\uf8e7the PRC and Russia\uf8e7for access to world markets and economic development.  \nThe PRC and Russia dominate Mongolia\u2019s external trade and are major sources of its foreign \ndirect investment (FDI). In particular, the PRC is Mongolia\u2019s largest source of FDI, its largest \nmarket for exports, and second largest country (after Russia) for its imports.12 Mongolia also \nuses the port of Tianjin13 in the PRC, the closest seaport, for access to the markets of the \nUnited States and other countries in Asia and the Pacific. However, the lack of paved roads \nleading to the PRC is a constraint. The majority of Mongolia\u2019s external trade is carried on the \nexisting north-south railway line, which connects Suhbaatar at the border with Russia and \nZamyn-Uud at the border with the PRC. While the railway is suitable for carrying long haul and \nbulk cargoes, it is less flexible and responsive to the needs of private traders for smaller freight \nand  over  shorter  distances.14  Railway  transport  is  also  subject  to  the  problem  of  different \ngauges between Mongolia and the PRC. The Project will increase Mongolia\u2019s access to world \nmarkets through the establishment of an all-weather road to link the highways of the PRC and \nRussia,15 and induce competition between railway and roads. \n \n8.  Transit Traffic. Given its geographic location, Mongolia can serve as a corridor for \ntransit traffic between the PRC and Russia. The north-south road corridor from Altanbulag to \nZamyn-Uud through Ulaanbaatar, will connect the Chinese road leading to the port of Tianjin \nand the Russian road leading to Europe via the cities of Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, and thus can \nbecome an important transit route between the two neighbors. Transit traffic via this corridor is \nprojected to grow by 6\u22128% per annum during 2009\u22122025, from 25.1 million to 90.5 million in \nTKM and from 113.9 million to 289.4 million in PKM. By providing faster, safer, and more \nreliable road transport, this corridor will not only increase the efficiency of transit traffic between \nthe PRC and Russia via Mongolia, but also become a sustainable source of foreign exchange \nearnings for Mongolia. The importance of this corridor as a transit gateway and part of the Asian \nhighway network is recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand the Pacific (UNESCAP). With ADB assistance, the Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar section was \n                                                 \n12 The PRC accounted for 41.5% of Mongolia\u2019s exports ($217.3 million) and 20.2% of its imports ($139.5 million) in \n2002, as well as 40.2% of its FDI ($45.4 million) in 2003. \n13 Ulaanbaatar is 1,700 km away from Tianjin, and about 6,000 km from the ports of Vladivostok and Nakhodka in \nRussia. \n14 For example, there is a shortage of rail wagons in Zamyn-Uud, so trucks that carry freight from the PRC often have \nto wait 4 or more days to transship the freight to wagons for further railway transport to other destinations in \nMongolia.  Moreover,  the  railway  does  not  unload  cargo  at  intermediate  stops  between  Zamyn-Uud  and \nUlaanbaatar (e.g., Choyr and Saynshand), so traders have to either carry the goods in passenger compartments, \nor receive their cargo in Ulaanbaatar and then travel back to the ultimate destinations. \n15 With the construction of an all-weather road between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud, the transit time for container \nmovements between Tianjin and Ulaanbaatar will be reduced from the current 7\u221222 days to 3 days because trucks \ndo not need to wait for wagons in Zamyn-Uud.  ", "4    \nrehabilitated and the Nalayh-Choyr section is under construction.16 The Project will complete the \nremaining section of the corridor between Choyr and the border with the PRC. \n \n9.  Poverty Reduction. Mongolia is a poor country: 35.6% of the population lives in poverty \n(1998) and per capita GDP is $505 (2003). The project feasibility study shows that about 10,500 \npeople (21.6% of the total population) in the project area are living in poverty. Poverty is largely \nincome-based  and  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  job  opportunities.  The  number  of  people \nunemployed in the project area was about 3,600 in 2002, with the unemployment rate at 18.4%. \nAs about 57% of the population are 25 years or younger and many young people enter the labor \nmarket each year, the unemployment and poverty situation in the project area is grave. The lack \nof paved roads between Choyr and Zamym-Uud hinders investors from doing business in the \nproject area and limits local communities\u2019 access to markets and social services. The Project \nwill help tackle the poverty problem in the project area by improving the road infrastructure, so \nas to attract investments, create local jobs, and provide local communities with better access to \nmarkets and social services. \n \n10.  Road  Safety.  Road  safety  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  Mongolia.  Poor  road \nconditions are among the major factors conducive to the increase in road accidents, together \nwith poor driving skills, high vehicular speeds, intoxicated driving, and technical problems of \nvehicles. The road surface is deteriorating and some sections lack road safety features (e.g., \nmarkings, signage, and guardrails). The problem is exacerbated by weak enforcement of traffic \nsafety regulations due to the limited capacity of the Traffic Police Department (TPD), as most \ntraffic police officers have neither appropriate training nor adequate monitoring equipment.  \nWith the present rate of increase in vehicle ownership, there is the potential for more road \naccidents. The Project will improve road safety by designing and constructing the project road \nand access roads according to national standards, complemented by the implementation of a \nroad safety improvement component. \n \n11.  The Government\u2019s road sector strategy aims to improve the efficiency of road transport \nto facilitate the country\u2019s economic and social development. The strategy focuses on (i) creating \na favorable environment for developing a competitive road transport industry, (ii) increasing \ninvestment on road construction and rehabilitation to reduce Mongolia\u2019s isolation from world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities within the country, (iii) increasing \nfunding for road maintenance, (iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, \nand (v) improving road safety. While progress has been made on creating a favorable climate \nfor a competitive road transport industry, severe fiscal constraints have limited the progress on \nincreasing  funding  for  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  improving  road  safety. \nMoreover, the strategy should review the need to maintain the existing road network in areas \nwith low population densities. A Road Master Plan prepared with ADB assistance17 identified \npriority sections for investment and improvement, but the Master Plan needs updating as many \npriority projects identified have been constructed or are under construction. The Government \nhas accorded high priority to the Project and the construction of the east-west millennium road \nthat links several aimag (province) centers with Ulaanbaatar. However, the millennium road has \nsignificant implications for the fiscal stability and debt sustainability of the country, and is a \nsubject of ongoing dialogue between external aid agencies and the Government. \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1995.

The main objective of ADB\u2019s assistance strategy for Mongolia is to foster pro-poor \neconomic  growth  to  reduce  poverty.18  The  strategy  focuses  on  support  for  (i)  creating  an \nenvironment conducive to private sector-led growth, (ii) generating employment, (iii) maintaining \nstandards of human development, (iv) strengthening and reforming the social protection system, \nand (v) undertaking governance reforms. The latest country strategy and program update for \nMongolia19 indicates that roads should continue to be among the strategic focuses of ADB \noperations, and gives priority to the completion of the north-south road corridor. The Project, \nwhich is included in the assistance program for 2004, is supportive of the objective of ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and is consistent with its efforts for promoting regional cooperation, as it would \ncontribute to increasing traffic, trade, and investment among countries in the region. \n \n13.  Mongolia\u2019s road sector has received external assistance since 1991 (Appendix 3). ADB \nhas approved two loans totaling $50 million and five TA grants totaling $3.3 million for improving \nthe  north-south  road  corridor,  supporting  sector  reforms,  and  building  DOR\u2019s  capacity.  \nADB  assistance,  which  helped  advance  its  road  sector  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in \nMongolia, included (i) developing the Road Act and the Road Transport Act to lay the basis for a \nsector policy framework, (ii) formulating the Road Master Plan, and (iii) establishing the Road \nBoard to monitor operation of the Road Fund. However, the recommendations of the ADB-\nfinanced TA\uf8e7that the Road Fund be used primarily for maintenance and that most of the Road \nFund revenues come from road-user charges set at levels reflecting the costs that vehicles \nimpose on the road system\uf8e7have not been fully implemented.20 \n \n14.  ADB assistance has been complemented by activities of other external aid agencies. \nThe World Bank extended two credits totaling $64 million to upgrade part of the east-west road \ncorridor, improve road safety and maintenance, and train DOR staff. The Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  provided  grants  for  improving  roads  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  in  eastern \nMongolia.  The  Kuwait  Fund  is  assisting  in  improving  the  Darhan-Erdenet-Bulgan  road.  \nWith  support  from  the  Nordic  Development  Fund,  the  Government  is  formulating  a  road \nmaintenance plan. ADB has coordinated closely with other external aid agencies in the road \nsector.  A  working  group  on  infrastructure,  cochaired  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  was \nestablished in April 2004 to coordinate external assistance activities. ADB and the World Bank \nagreed to harmonize their respective positions on road sector issues and jointly assist the \nGovernment to develop a transport sector strategy that would assess total funding requirements \nto maintain the existing road network, identify major funding constraints, and recommend how to \naddress these constraints over the medium term. ADB also consults with UNESCAP regularly to \nmaintain collaboration in the road sector. \n \n15.  Lessons Learned. ADB\u2019s portfolio performance in Mongolia\u2019s road sector has been \ngenerally  satisfactory.  Evaluation  of  the  country  assistance  program  conducted  in  200221 \nconcluded that ADB\u2019s road sector projects helped increase traffic counts and expand economic \nactivities  in  the  project  road-influenced  areas.  The  first  road  project  for  rehabilitating  the \nAltanbulag-Ulaanbaatar section was completed in 2001 and was rated as highly successful.22 \nWhile  implementation  of  the  second  road  project  for  developing  the  Nalayh-Choyr  section \nexperienced initial delays due to limited experience of the contractor and the executing agency, \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2000.

", "6    \nthe pace of implementation has picked up and the Government and the contractor are working \non the target of completing the project at the end of 2004 as scheduled. Nevertheless, the road \nprojects supported by ADB and other external aid agencies in Mongolia and in the region have \nprovided four major lessons, which have been incorporated into the design of this Project.  \nFirst, loan projects involve risks of implementation delays because of (i) limited experience of \nimplementing agencies and contractors; (ii) Mongolia\u2019s extreme winter conditions that limit the \nannual construction season to only 6 months (April\u2212October), which means that even minor \ndelays in contractors\u2019 mobilization schedule or processing of project documents may result in \nslippage of 1 year in project implementation; and (iii) the complexity of resolving cross-border \nissues.23 While DOR\u2019s project management capacity has improved through training, it would be \nfurther strengthened by consulting services under the Project. Special attention will also be paid \nduring the bidding process to ensure the recruitment of experienced civil works contractors. \n \n16.  Second, the Government\u2019s repeated difficulties in meeting funding requirements for road \nmaintenance through the state budget highlights the need to establish a sustainable funding \nmechanism. Since the Road Fund by itself is not a guarantee that sufficient funds will be \nprovided to meet the needs of the road network, the Project will establish a facility in Zamyn-\nUud to collect vehicle fees, with fee revenues to be allocated to the Road Fund for road \nmaintenance. The fee revenues generated are estimated to be sufficient not only to cover the \nannual maintenance cost of the project road, but also to contribute for maintenance of other \npriority roads in the country. Third, adequate attention should be paid to road safety issues \nwhen  formulating  and  implementing  road  projects.  While  road  safety  features  will  be \nincorporated into the project design, the Project includes a road safety improvement component \n(para. 22). Fourth, the impact of road infrastructure projects on the local community and on \npoverty  reduction  should  be  strengthened.  The  Project  includes  an  area  development \ncomponent that will enhance project benefits for local communities, including the poor (paras. \n23\u221227).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n17.  The goal of the Project is to promote regional cooperation and sustainable economic \ngrowth in Mongolia. The purpose is to increase the efficiency and safety of domestic and \ninternational transit traffic between the PRC and Russia through Mongolia\u2019s north-south road \ntransport corridor. The project area covers a population of about 48,400 in the aimags of \nDornogovi and Govisumber in Mongolia. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n18.  The  Project  consists  of  five  components:  (i)  construction  of  the  project  road,  \n(ii)  implementation  of  a  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan,  (iii)  road  safety \nimprovement, (iv) implementation of an area development program, and (v) TA for awareness \nand prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the north-south road corridor. \n \n                                                 \n23 For example, it took more than 2 years before the Cross-Border Agreement between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, supported by ADB, was signed by the two governments and became effective. ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "    7 \n1.  Project Road \n19.  The project road, about 428 km, extends from Choyr (the point where the ADB-assisted \nSecond Roads Development Project ends) to the border with the PRC in Zamyn-Uud. The route \nbetween Choyr and Saynshand will run parallel to the railway line on the eastern side, while the \nroute between Saynshand and Zamyn-Uud will lie on the western side of the railway line, with a \nrailway level crossing in Saynshand. The project road will be designed according to Mongolian \nhighway design standards. The Choyr-Zamyn-Uud section will be a two-lane paved road with \n7.0-meter (m)-wide pavement and 1.5 m shoulders. The section between Zamyn-Uud and the \nborder with the PRC will be a four-lane paved road with 14.0 m wide pavement and 2.0 m \nshoulders. Civil works costs are estimated at $50.1 million equivalent. \n \n20.  As the project area is semiarid and sparsely vegetated steppe, vegetation will be planted \nalong the project road for a length of 15\u221218 km at intervals within an approximate distance of \n130 km to serve as windbreaks to control snow and sand drifts. About $1 million equivalent will \nbe allocated for vegetation planting. \n \n2.  Cross-Border Road Transport Facilitation Plan \n21.  The plan aims to promote efficient movement of vehicles across the Mongolian-PRC \nborder  (Appendix  4).  The  plan  comprises  the  Government\u2019s  committed  actions,  within  the \nspecific time frame, to (i) develop a transit traffic framework agreement with the PRC and \nRussia, (ii) establish regulations on cross-border vehicles according to international standards, \n(iii)  negotiate  with  the  PRC  on  increased  access  of  Mongolian  vehicles  to  PRC  territory,  \n(iv) improve the road between Zamyn-Uud and the border with the PRC, (v) collect vehicle fees \nfor road maintenance, (vi) enforce vehicle weight control, and (vii) establish emergency services \nfor vehicles and passengers traveling on the north-south road corridor. The amount of $230,000 \nequivalent will be allocated for consulting services to assist in implementing the plan. \n \n3.  Road Safety Improvement \n22.  This  component  comprises  (i)  installation  of  road  safety  features  (i.e.,  centerline \nmarkings,  reflectors  on  the  shoulders,  road  signs,  safety  barriers,  and  telephone  lines  for \nreporting  emergencies  along  the  road)  on  the  Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section  ($350,000);  \n(ii) independent road safety audit of the detailed design of the Project ($15,000); (iii) distribution \nof pamphlets and posters on road safety to raise public awareness; (iv) procurement of two \npatrol vehicles equipped with breath analyzers and speed monitoring equipment and 11 two-\nway  communication  radios  ($63,200);  and  (v)  training  of  traffic  police  officers  on  traffic \nregulations and enforcement by an international specialist within 1 year before the project road \nis opened ($46,000). The component will complement the inclusion of safety features into the \ndesign of the project road. DOR will coordinate with TPD on training the traffic police officers, \nand these officers will then deliver road safety education to concerned local communities.  \nThe amount of $474,200 equivalent will be allocated for this component. \n \n4.  Area Development \n23.  This component is designed to ensure that the benefits generated from the project road \nare shared adequately with local communities, including the poor. The component comprises  \n(i) construction of access roads, (ii) establishment of roadside stations, (iii) local labors\u2019 training \non road construction and maintenance, and (iv) stakeholder participation. \n ", "8    \n24.  Access Roads. Four access roads totaling 34 km will be constructed to facilitate the \nmovement  of  people  and  goods  between  towns  in  the  project  area  and  the  project  road.  \nThe four access roads comprise (i) a road from Erdene (10 km), (ii) a road from Orgon (20 km), \nand (iii) two roads from Saynshand (2 km each). The roads were selected with stakeholder \nparticipation and consultation. The roads from Saynshand will be built to the same standards as \nthe project road, while the road from Erdene and Orgon will be single-lane roads with double \nbituminous surface treatment (DBST) surface, with 4 m wide pavement, and 1 m shoulders.  \nThe amount of $3.6 million equivalent will be allocated for constructing the access roads. \n \n25.  Roadside Stations. Roadside stations serve as a place for interaction between road \noperators/users and local communities, and offer an organized venue for local specialty shops, \nrestaurants,  rests,  emergency  services,  gas  stations,  and  centers  for  traffic  and  local \ninformation, thus stimulating local business, jobs, and revenues. Roadside stations also reduce \nthe  transport  costs  of  local  residents  to  distant  markets.  A  pilot  roadside  station  at  the \nintersection between the project road and the access road linking Erdene is proposed for grant \nfunding from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).24 Erdene was selected for its high \npoverty incidence, underdeveloped status, availability of resources, and reasonable intervals \nbetween aimag centers.25 The pilot roadside station will be developed with the participation of \nlocal communities. The proposed JFPR grant is expected to finance detailed design of the \nroadside  station,  skills  training  for  small  enterprise  development  and  the  poor,  and  the \nestablishment and operation of a community-based participatory monitoring and evaluation \nsystem. If the pilot roadside station is successful, the Government plans to replicate it in other \nroad sector projects. \n \n26.  Local  Laborers\u2019  Training  on  Road  Construction  and  Maintenance.  Training  for \nsemiskilled equipment operators and construction workers will be conducted in the project area \nwithin 12 months after loan effectiveness to ensure maximum use of local labor during road \nconstruction. DOR will conduct the training program, while the governments of Dornogovi and \nGovisumber aimags will select the trainees, preferably unemployed youths. The trainees are \nexpected to be hired first for constructing access roads. With the experience gained, they will \nlikely be hired for constructing the project road. DOR will also train households living along the \nproject road on road maintenance 1 year before project completion. These households will then \nbe contracted by DOR to maintain short segments of the project road. The amount of $63,000 \nequivalent will be allocated for the training program. \n \n27.  Stakeholder Participation. Stakeholder participation began during project preparation \nand will continue during implementation to enhance the local community\u2019s ownership of the \nProject. Stakeholder participation will focus on (i) support for maximum use of local labor during \nroad construction and for good working conditions, (ii) job creation through business advice and \nskills development, (iii) development of roadside stations, (iv) implementation of the road safety \nprogram, (iv) involvement of households in road maintenance, (v) awareness and prevention of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and (vi) community-based environmental enhancement and \nmonitoring. A local nongovernment organization (NGO) will be engaged to facilitate stakeholder \nparticipation. The amount of $128,800 equivalent will be allocated for the service. \n \n                                                 \n24 The concept paper for the proposed roadside station component for JFPR funding was cleared on 13 February \n2004, and the component is expected to be submitted to the Government of Japan by 15 December 2004.  \n25 About 35.2% of the 623 households in Erdene live in poverty. Erdene has a kidney treatment center. It produces \nlivestock products and has potential for developing products such as shoes and bags. Many poor women in the \narea expressed interest in engaging in various income-generating activities such as garment making. \n ", "    9 \n5.  Awareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n28.  While Mongolia is at the early stage of HIV/AIDS epidemics with only four registered \ncases,26 the country is vulnerable to diseases due to high-risk behavior among the young \npopulation,  an  increasing  number  of  sex  workers  inexperienced  on  condom  use,  high \nprevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and rapidly growing HIV/AIDS diseases in \nthe neighboring countries. The construction of the project road and the operation of the north-\nsouth road transport corridor after project completion may increase the spread of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking because of a large number of workers during construction and increased \nmovement of the population across the borders with the PRC and Russia. With high poverty \nincidence,  women  are  disproportionately  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  for \nprostitution.27 The TA will help mitigate potential risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human \ntrafficking along the north-south road corridor. \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  Regional Cooperation. The Project will establish Mongolia\u2019s first paved road corridor to \nlink the Asian highway network of the PRC and Russia, and will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s transport \nlinks to its trading partners in the region. The project road will serve as an important corridor for \ntransit traffic, facilitating trade and reducing transaction costs in the region. The Republic of \nKorea and the PRC will provide concessional or grant resources to cofinance the construction of \nthe  project  road,  while  Japan  through  JFPR  is  expected  to  provide  financial  support  for \nestablishing the pilot roadside station. Implementing the cross-border road transport facilitation \nplan will foster the efficient movement of goods and passengers between Mongolia and the \nPRC. The Project is thus an example of ADB\u2019s efforts in promoting regional cooperation. \n \n30.  Policy Dialogue. ADB has continued policy dialogue with the Government on road \nsector financing (including the millennium road) and maintenance during the preparation of the \nProject. Important progress has been made in this regard. Following a substantial increase in \nroad maintenance funding from the Road Fund to MNT5.0 billion ($4.2 million) in 2004,28 the \nGovernment agreed to continue to increase road maintenance funding by 8% per annum to \nMNT7.5 billion in 2009 to fully meet the funding requirement. Moreover, the Project includes \nestablishing a facility in Zamyn-Uud to collect vehicle fees beginning in 2009, with fee revenues \nto be allocated to the Road Fund for road maintenance.29 Based on projected traffic, the \nestimated fee revenues would amount to about $2.0 million in 2009 and would increase to $3.6 \nmillion in 2025 (Appendix 5).30 This amount will not only be sufficient to cover the estimated \nannual maintenance cost of $1.9 million for the project road, but also contribute to funding to \nmaintain other priority roads in the country. The Government has agreed to engage the private \nsector for the fee collection services. These measures will complement the development of the \nGovernment\u2019s new transport sector strategy to address road sector financing and maintenance \nissues over the medium term. \n \n31.  Impact on Local Communities. The Project has been formulated to maximize the \npoverty  reduction  impact  on  local  communities  through  the  area  development  component.  \n                                                 \n26 The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS estimates that about 300 persons might have been infected with \nHIV in Mongolia by the end of 2003. \n27 An attempted trafficking of over 400 Mongolian girls was reported in the UB Post on 30 January 2004. \n28 This increased road maintenance funding by more than 170% compared with 2003. \n29 Fees will be collected amounting to $1 for small and medium cars, $1.5 for jeeps, $2 for small trucks and buses, $5 \nfor medium trucks and buses, $10 for large buses, and $20 for trucks with trailers. \n30 The amount of fee revenues to be collected from vehicles from the PRC and Russia during 2009\u22122025 is \nestimated at $6.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. ", "10    \nThe construction of local roads will improve the access of local residents to markets, job \nopportunities, and social services. The establishment of the pilot roadside station will expand \nlocal business and create jobs for local people. Training on road construction and maintenance \nwill improve the skills of local laborers, including the poor, so that they could be hired during \nproject implementation. The stakeholder participatory process will encourage involvement of \nlocal communities in project design and implementation. With these activities, the Project will \ncontribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the project area. \n \n32.  Awareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The  Project \nincludes the TA to address the risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking, which may \nbe associated with a large number of construction workers and the increased cross-border \nmovement of the population along the north-south road corridor after project completion. This is \nthe first externally financed project in Mongolia that will help develop road infrastructure and \naddress  the  issues  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  concurrently.  This  combination  will \nstrengthen the positive social impacts of the Project. \n \n33.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation. During project preparation, consultations \nwere held with the Government, civil society, local communities, and other external aid agencies \non major issues such as project alternatives, route alignment, social and environmental impacts, \nand project benefits for local communities (Appendix 6). The consultations revealed a high \ndegree of public support for the Project. Stakeholder participation and consultation will continue \nduring project implementation under the area development component.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n34.  The total project cost is estimated at $78.1 million equivalent, comprising $52.8 million \n(67.6%) in foreign exchange and $25.3 million equivalent (32.4%) in local currency.

Financing Plan \n35.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in various currencies equivalent \nto SDR25,505,000 ($37.13 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe Project. The proposed loan will finance $31.6 million (59.8%) of the foreign exchange cost \nand $5.5 million equivalent (21.7%) of the local currency cost, or 47.5% of the total project cost. \nThe  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  PRC  will  cofinance  the  Project  on  a  parallel  basis.  \nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will extend a loan of $23.9 million equivalent on \nconcessional terms to finance 30.6% of the total project cost for civil works for part of the Choyr-\nSaynshand section. The PRC Government will provide a grant of $1.5 million equivalent to \nfinance 1.9% of the total project cost for civil works for upgrading the section between Zamyn-\nUud and the border with the PRC. The Mongolian Government will finance 20% of the total \nproject cost (i.e., $15.6 million equivalent) including local taxes and duties. \n \n36.  The proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The loan from the Republic of Korea will have a maturity of 30 years including \na grace period of 10 years, with an interest rate of 2% per annum. The Borrower will be \nMongolia.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  DOR will be the Executing Agency to oversee and coordinate project implementation.  \nTo ensure close interagency coordination and effective implementation, DOR will be assisted by \na project steering committee (PSC) and a project implementation unit (PIU). The PSC will be set \nup at the central level to supervise project implementation. It will be chaired by the state \nsecretary of finance and economy and will comprise representatives of the ministries of finance \nand  economy,  foreign  affairs,  health,  infrastructure,  justice  and  home  affairs,  nature  and \nenvironment, DOR, and governments of Dornogovi and Govisumber aimags. The PSC will meet \nat least once every 6 months to review the progress of implementation and provide guidance, as \nnecessary. ADB will attend the PSC meetings as observer. \n \n38.  A PIU will be established within DOR to implement activities on a day-to-day basis.  \nThe deputy director of DOR will be appointed project director to head the PIU. The project \ndirector will be assisted by two full-time project managers: one to implement the road section \nfunded by the loan from the Republic of Korea and the other to implement the remaining project ", "12    \ncomponents. The project director and the project managers will be assisted by a team31 of \nqualified technical, financial, and administrative staff in the PIU. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The Project will be implemented over about 5 years, from August 2004 to July 2009.  \nA proposed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  Goods and services to be financed out of the proposed ADB loan will be procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia. \nCivil works for the project road (including the two access roads to Saynshand and vegetation \nplanting)  and  the  access  road  from  Orgon  are  divided  into  four  contract  packages  to  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding,  or  according  to  relevant  bilateral \nagreements. Because the civil works contracts will cost less than $1 million and domestic \ncontractors are capable of undertaking such works, civil works for the access road from Erdene \nand the provision of safety features on the Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar road section will be procured \nfollowing local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Patrol vehicles equipped with \nbreath analyzers and portable speed monitoring equipment, two-way communication radios, \nand a vehicle weight mat will be procured following direct purchase or local competitive bidding \nprocedures. The proposed contract packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n41.  The  Government  was  informed  that  ADB  encourages  joint  ventures  through  the \ndomestic  preference  margin  for  supply  contracts,  and  requires  the  borrower  (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-funded contracts to \nobserve the highest standard of ethics in procuring and executing such contracts. \n \n42.  Advance procurement action for civil works has been approved. Advance action will be \nundertaken according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement up to, but will not include, the \nsigning of contracts. It will cover (i) short-listing and selecting a consulting firm for construction \nsupervision,  (ii)  prequalifying  contractors,  and  (iii)  tendering  and  bid  evaluation.  \nThe Government was advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  The Project will provide 1,158 person-months of consulting services (177.5 international \nand 980.5 domestic) to assist in implementation. Of that number, 161 (international) and 884 \n(domestic) person-months will be required for detailed design, construction supervision, support \nfor project management, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The services will be provided \nby consulting firms with experience in detailed design and implementation of road projects of \nsimilar nature and size. The supervision team will be mobilized on the date the contractor begin \nthe works. During the defect liability period, the resident engineer will continue on a part-time \nbasis while the supervision team members will be mobilized on an as-required intermittent \nbasis. \n \n44.  Consulting  services  of  4  (international)  and  80  (domestic)  person-months  will  be \nprovided  through  a  local  NGO  to  help  implement  the  area  development  component.  \n                                                 \n31 Comprising four highway engineers, an accountant, and two administrative assistants.  \n ", "    13 \nThe services required cover (i) continued stakeholder participation process, (ii) monitoring of \nsocial safeguards, (iii) training for small enterprise and skills development, and (iv) support for \nvulnerable groups. For the road safety improvement component, an international consultant and \na domestic consultant will be engaged for 2 person-weeks each to jointly audit road safety \naspects of the detailed design of the Project. An international consultant will also be engaged for \n2 person-months to train traffic police officers on traffic regulations and enforcement. Further, an \ninternational consulting firm will provide 10 (international) and 16 (domestic) person-months of \nconsulting services to assist in implementing the cross-border road transport facilitation plan. \nThe Government will finance consulting services for detailed design, while ADB will finance the \nremaining consulting services. ADB-financed consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \nand engaging domestic consultants. \n \n45.  Facilities  (e.g.,  office  space,  vehicles,  communication,  and  staff  housing)  for  the \nconstruction supervision consultants will be provided under the civil works contracts. DOR will \nprovide administrative and logistical support to the consultants in the discharge of their duties. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001).  Since  most  payments  will  be  made  for  contracts  well  above \n$100,000, direct payment procedures will be used to withdraw the loan funds. If government \nfunds are first used for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement procedures will be applied. \nTo expedite loan disbursement, the Government will open after loan effectiveness an imprest \naccount at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial deposit of $500,000 equivalent. \nThe imprest account will be managed and liquidated according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure may be used for reimbursing eligible expenses and liquidating advances from the \nimprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE \nprocedure will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n47.  To ensure smooth project implementation, the proposed ADB loan, the loan from the \nRepublic of Korea, the PRC grant, and counterpart funding from the Mongolian Government are \nrequired to be disbursed according to the implementation schedule in Appendix 8. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  DOR will maintain separate project accounts and prepare financial statements for the \nProject according to international accounting standards. DOR will have the project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  with  adequate \nqualification and experience in international accounting and auditing and acceptable to ADB. \nThe audit report covering the audited project account and financial statements for each fiscal \nyear, together with a management letter, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement of timely submission of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nproposed ADB loan in case of noncompliance with the requirement. An independent road safety \naudit of the detailed design of the project road and access roads will be conducted before civil \nworks start. \n \n49.  DOR will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports on progress made and problems \nencountered  during  the  period  under  review,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the ", "14    \nproblems, and proposed activities and expected progress during the following period. Within  \n3 months of the completion of the Project, DOR will submit a project completion report to ADB to \nfacilitate postevaluation of the Project. The project completion report will provide details of \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  The  Mission  and  the  Government  have  jointly  prepared  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system (PPMS) (Appendix 10). The baseline values for project impact indicators will \nbe established before project implementation. Monitoring indicators will be measured with the \nnecessary frequency during project implementation. Findings will be incorporated in quarterly \nreports to ADB. In addition to indicators for implementation monitoring, indicators for project \nevaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where relevant, \nindicators will be disaggregated by sex. Participatory surveys will be conducted and results \ncompared with the baseline values. The construction supervision consultant will assist DOR in \nmonitoring and evaluating the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the Project.  \nAt inception, project completion, and 3 years after completion, DOR will submit to ADB a report \nthat summarizes the key findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the  \n3 preceding years. \n \n8.  Project Review \n51.  ADB will conduct regular (at least once a year) reviews of the Project\u2018s progress. If the \nreviews  show  serious  implementation  problems,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on \nappropriate mitigating measures to ensure achievement of the project objectives. In the second \nyear of construction of the project road, the Government and ADB will carry out a midterm \nreview of the Project to assess (i) implementation status; (ii) design and construction standards; \n(iii) performance of consultants and contractors; (iv) project impacts, particularly those relating \nto  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and \npoverty  reduction;  (v)  progress  on  road  sector  reforms;  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the \ncovenants stipulated in the loan agreement; and (vii) the need for additional works or changes in \nproject scope. With assistance from DOR, ADB will make a preliminary assessment of the \nsocioeconomic impacts of the Project by comparing indicators collected at the midterm review \nwith the baseline data. \n \n9.  Anticorruption \n52.  The Mission emphasized ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy to the Government and executing \nagency, highlighting the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe Mission also assessed financial management and procurement capacity in Mongolia. DOR \nhas adopted accounting and auditing procedures according to the Law on Accounting (approved \nin  2002)  and  the  State  Audit  Law  (approved  in  2003),  which  are  based  on  international \naccounting  and  auditing  standards.  Mongolia\u2019s  performance  in  submitting  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements for ADB-assisted projects has been generally satisfactory, \nalthough there was one case of noncompliance each year during 2001\u22122003. The risks of theft \nor misappropriation of ADB funds are comparatively low in Mongolia, but the country needs to \ncontinue anticorruption efforts. The Government has agreed to follow ADB\u2019s anticorruption \npolicy during project implementation. \n \n ", "    15 \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n53.  The Government has requested ADB to provide under the Project TA for awareness and \nprevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the north-south road corridor. The goal of the \nTA is to reduce the risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking that may be associated with the \nconstruction of the project road and operation of the north-south road transport corridor after \nproject completion. The purposes of the TA are to (i) raise public awareness of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking; (ii) address the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission among construction workers, \nsex workers, local communities, truck drivers, and other road users; and (iii) strengthen border \ncontrol capacity against human trafficking. Consultants with expertise in anti-human trafficking, \nhealth education and advocacy, HIV/AIDS medical services, and epidemiological surveillance \nand monitoring will provide 1.5 (international) and 160 (domestic) person-months of consulting \nservices. Individual consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. Equipment, supplies, and materials will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are in Appendix 11. \n \n54.  The  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $420,000  equivalent,  comprising  $115,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $305,000 equivalent in local currency. A grant of $350,000 equivalent from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program is proposed to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $235,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost by providing counterpart staff, office space, and workshop facilities.  \n \n55.  The Ministry of Health will be the Executing Agency and will implement the TA in \ncoordination  with  DOR.  The  PIU  of  the  ADB-assisted  Second  Health  Sector  Development \nProject32  (Loan  1998)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  full-time  TA  coordinator  will  be \nappointed  and  two  small  offices  with  part-time  assistants  will  be  set  up  at  the  health \ndepartments of Dornogovi and Govisumber aimags in Saynshand and Choyr, respectively.  \nA steering committee will be established at the national level to guide TA implementation.  \nThe  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  health  and  comprise \nrepresentatives of the PIU of the Second Health Sector Development Project, DOR, ministries \nof health and justice and home affairs, the General Customs Office, and a technical expert \ngroup. Advisory groups will also be set up at local levels, chaired by the governors\u2019 offices, with \nrepresentatives of aimag health and road departments; local transport operators; police, border, \nand customs officers; local communities; and relevant NGOs. The TA will be implemented over \n4.5 years, from February 2005 to July 2009. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n56.  The Project will benefit the people living along the road corridor in Mongolia (about \n48,400  based  on  the  2003  population),  road  transport  operators  and  users,  construction \ncompanies, traders, and other people who derive income from expanded traffic, trade, and \ninvestment in the region. The major benefits would accrue in the form of improved trade and \ntransit, and the significant reduction in transaction costs among the PRC, Mongolia, Russia, and \nother trading partners. Major direct benefits will be lower transport costs, faster and more \nreliable  road  transport  services,  and  job  and  income  opportunities  created  during  project \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Second Health Sector Development Project. Manila. ", "16    \nimplementation (i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) or after project completion. \nThe Project is expected to create about 1,800 jobs on road construction for Mongolians, which \nwill generate income amounting to MNT3.4 billion ($2.9 million). Moreover, 210 households are \nexpected to be hired to maintain the project road, which will provide an average supplemental \nincome of MNT55,000 ($48) per family per year. Improved access to markets and reduced \ntransport costs will also help reduce prices and improve the quality and availability of food and \nother traded goods. Indirect benefits will be increased business and job opportunities that have \nbackward or forward linkages to the Project in Mongolia, the PRC, and Russia.  \n \n57.  Distribution analysis shows that the Project will result in net benefits of $268.3 million, \ncomprising $235.7 million for Mongolia, $29.4 million for the PRC, and $3.2 million for Russia. \nMongolia will account for 87.8% of the total benefits, while the PRC and Russia are expected to \nreceive 11% and 1.2% of the total benefits, respectively. Within Mongolia, passengers and \nfreight shippers are the major beneficiaries, accounting for 57.8% and 26.3% of total benefits. \nThe Government\u2019s share is 15.9%. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n58.  The economic analysis33 of the Project compared the with- and without-project cases \n(Appendix  12).  The  analysis  is  based  on  2003  economic  prices  and  covers  20  years \n(2006\u22122025) comprising 3 years of construction and 17 years of operation. \n \n59.  Traffic  forecasts  for  2006\u22122025  were  made  based  on  an  analysis  of  macro  level \ndemographic and economic trends for Mongolia as well as for the corridor between Choyr and \nthe PRC border in Zamyn-Uud, and traffic surveys conducted along the project road. Mongolia\u2019s \nGDP is projected to grow by 4.5% per annum and its population to increase by 0.95% per \nannum during 2006\u22122025; these figures are largely in line with recent growth rates. Based on \neconomic and demographic growth projections, aggregate traffic for the corridor between Choyr \nand the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud is forecast to grow by 6.3% for freight traffic in TKM and \n5.1% for passenger traffic in PKM during 2006\u22122025. Traffic growth rates are higher than the \nrate for GDP because transport intensity of the economy has increased in recent years, with \nfreight transport intensity growing at a faster rate than passenger transport intensity. \n \n60.  Transport between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud is by road and rail. Based on the existing \nmodal  shares  and  an  analysis  of  traffic  patterns  on  modal  preference  derived  from  traffic \nsurveys, the projected corridor traffic was disaggregated into road and rail modes. The railway is \nprojected to remain the dominant mode of transport, although its shares in TKM and PKM are \nexpected to decrease gradually. The road will attract traffic, particularly from 2009 mainly due to \ndiverted traffic from railways. The share of the road is projected to increase from 0.4% to 5.8% \nin TKM and from 3.7% to 23.8% in PKM during 2006\u20132025. \n \n61.  On the basis of projected corridor traffic, traffic count surveys along the project road \nalignment during August\u2212September 2003, and data from DOR, traffic forecasts for with- and \nwithout-project cases were made. In the without-project case, traffic would continue to move \nalong the existing multiple unimproved earth tracks (normal traffic). The average daily traffic \n(ADT) will remain relatively low, from 288 vehicles in 2006 to 864 vehicles in 2025. In the with- \nproject case, ADT will increase significantly from 2009, the first year of operation of the project \n                                                 \n33 The economic analysis covers Mongolia only and does not take into account the project benefits accruing to the \nPRC and Russia. \n \n ", "    17 \nroad, since the road is forecast to carry diverted and generated traffic. ADT is projected to grow \nfrom 288 vehicles in 2006 to 3,075 vehicles in 2025. Regional traffic (i.e., traffic from or to \nMongolia and transit traffic via Mongolia) is projected to constitute the majority of total traffic, \nwith its share growing from about 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n \n62.  There are four ways of meeting the projected road traffic between Choyr and Zamyn-\nUud: (i) construction of an asphalt concrete road; (ii) construction of a road with DBST surface; \n(iii) construction of a gravel road; and (iv) expansion of the capacity of the existing railway \ninstead of constructing the project road, given that the preliminary alignment for the project road \nroughly parallels the railway line. An alternatives analysis shows that the railway alternative has \nthe lowest value in terms of economic internal rate of return (EIRR) (19.7%) and net present \nvalue (NPV, $59.1 million), and is thus less economically feasible. The gravel road option has \nthe second lowest value, with an EIRR of 26.4% and NPV of $68.2 million. The EIRR is highest \nfor the DBST road option (30.4%) and the second highest for the asphalt concrete road option \n(29.7%). In terms of NPV, the asphalt concrete road option ($131.3 million) shows a higher \nvalue than the DBST road option ($121.9 million). In view of NPV and given that the project road \nforms part of the Asian highway network and other sections of the north-south road corridor \nbetween Altanbulag and Choyr are asphalt concrete, the asphalt concrete road option appears \na better choice than the DBST option. The alternatives analysis indicated that an asphalt \nconcrete road between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud is the economically efficient \noption for increasing transport capacity on this corridor.  \n \n63.  The Project\u2019s primary benefit is transport cost savings due to the improved road surface \nroughness34 and resultant increases in vehicle speeds. Transport cost savings are estimated to \naccount for 96% of the total project benefits. The Project is expected to result in an average \nvehicle operating cost reduction of 43.1% per unit traveling between Choyr and the PRC border \nin Zamyn-Uud, ranging between 36.1% per car and 45.5% per heavy bus. The Project will also \nsave travel time because of the relatively straight alignment of the project road and increased \naverage vehicle speeds. The Project is expected to reduce average travel time between Choyr \nand the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud by 56%, from 13.4 hours to 5.9 hours per trip. The Project \nwill contribute to reducing road accidents, but such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not \nincluded in the economic analysis. The Project is not designed to alleviate traffic congestion \nsince  congestion  is  generally  not  a  concern  in  the  road  sector  of  Mongolia,  except  for \nUlaanbaatar during the rush hours on workdays. \n \n64.  Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR of the Project exceeds the cutoff level of 12%, \nexcept when (i) the Project\u2019s capital costs increase by 214%, (ii) road maintenance costs \nincrease by 1,139%, (iii) the surface roughness of the project road during the dry season \nincreases by 175%, and (iv) traffic growth or user benefits are reduced by 66%. However, such \nsignificant changes in those variables are unlikely to occur. \n \n65.  Risk analysis examined the probability distribution of the estimated EIRR and NPV of the \nProject. Within the assumed range of parameter estimates, the probability that the EIRR of the \nProject is less than 12% or NPV is negative 26%. The median EIRR is 14.7% with a range of \n0.5%\u221231.5%, and the medium NPV amounts to $22.7 million with a range of negative $110.9 \nmillion\u2013$152.2 million. \n \n                                                 \n34 The Project will significantly improve the road surface roughness between Choyr and the border with the PRC in \nZamyn-Uud, with reduction in its international roughness index value from the present 20\u221222 to 2\u22123. ", "18    \nC.  Project Impacts \n1.  Impact on Poverty Reduction  \n66.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Mongolia  by  creating  jobs  and \npromoting sustainable economic growth. The social and poverty analysis undertaken during \nproject preparation shows that about 10,500 poor (or 21.6% of total project beneficiaries) in the \nproject  area  will  benefit.  The  major  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project  will  include  \n(i)  creating  jobs  and  income  for  the  poor  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  the \nestablishment of the pilot roadside station; (ii) building local roads to increase the access of poor \ncommunities to markets and social services; (iii) developing job skills of the poor through \ntraining; (iv) lowering prices of food and other daily necessities in local markets due to reduced \ntransport costs and travel time; (v) improving water supply from wells constructed during project \nimplementation; (vi) improving road safety; and (vii) addressing potential risks of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking. For the poor, the Project is expected to create about 770 jobs in road \nconstruction,  comprising  130  for  skilled  and  semiskilled  labor  and  640  for  unskilled  labor. \nMoreover, about 70 poor households will likely be hired to maintain the project road after project \ncompletion. By the current wage level in Mongolia, these jobs are expected to earn a total \nannual salary of $1.2 million and help lift 1,574 poor households (about 6,300 people) out of \npoverty. The Project will thus move Mongolia toward achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals.35 A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n2.  Social and Gender Impacts \n67.  Land acquired for the Project and temporary use of land for construction will not involve \nany removal of structures or affect private landowners. The land acquired for the project road \nand access roads is state-owned, and is either wasteland or communal grazing land. The area \nof grazing land lost is insignificant compared with the total area required for grazing. There are \nadequate government regulations and procedures for transferring the right-of-way to DOR.  \nThe Project requires no resettlement. \n \n68.  The  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  the  livelihoods  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  who \ninclude Kazakh, Durvud, and Bayad and account for 3.5% of the population in the project area. \nThese groups do not face discrimination and are not considered vulnerable. The Project will \nhave no significant adverse impacts on the livelihoods of nomadic herders in the project area. \nInstead, it can help spur the development of the local livestock industry with improved access to \nmarkets and growing domestic and regional demands for livestock products. \n \n69.  The vulnerable groups in the project area are the poor, women (especially single female \nheads of households, or those with disabled family members), the disabled or chronically ill, \norphans, the elderly, and unemployed youths. The major constraint for these groups is the lack \nof job opportunities and skills. The Project will provide equal job opportunities for women and \nother vulnerable groups, help develop their skills, and address their needs by engaging them in \nproject design and implementation. Measures to promote women's participation and mitigate \npotentially  negative  impacts  on  women  are  integrated  into  the  project  components  and \nassurances. \n \n                                                 \n35 ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for Mongolia (2004\u22122006) (footnote 19) states: \u201cTo help the country \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, ADB needs to continue to help promote economic growth for job \ncreation and improve provision of essential social services for the poor.\u201d  \n ", "    19 \n70.  The Project will also have positive social impacts with the implementation of specific \ncomponents or measures to address issues such as HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, adequate \nworking conditions, and road safety. \n \n3.  Environmental Impact  \n71.  ADB classifies the Project in environmental category \u201cB sensitive\u201d. The environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) was undertaken through broad-based public consultations, and the \nsummary was circulated to the Board and made public on the ADB web site on 5 March 2004. \nThe EIA approved by the Ministry of Nature and Environment on 12 May 2004 concludes that \nthe Project will have no major adverse impacts on the environment. The project road alignment, \nwhich follows the railway line and crosses steppe and semidesert areas, does not impinge on \nany  existing  or  planned  protected  areas  and  is  not  expected  to  affect  wildlife  migration. \nOperation of a paved road will improve the environment as it provides an alternative to currently \ndriving through multiple unimproved earth tracks, which has contributed to land degradation. \nPlanting  of  vegetation  at  specific  locations  along  the  project  road  will  help  improve  the \nenvironment by controlling snow and sand drifts. The Government will implement the mitigating \nmeasures proposed in the EIA during project implementation. \n \nD.  Project Risks \n72.  The  Project  has  three  potential  risks.  First,  there  might  be  implementation  delays \nbecause of DOR\u2019s limited experience in managing the construction of a relatively long road. \nThis  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  consulting  services  to  assist  in  project  management  and \nimplementation, and advance action on procurement. Second, counterpart funds may not be \nprovided on a timely basis. ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure that sufficient \ncounterpart funds for the Project are allocated in a timely manner. Third, maintenance of the \nproject road after completion may be inadequate due to insufficient funding. This risk will be \nmitigated mainly through the establishment of the facility in Zamyn-Uud to collect vehicle fees \nbeginning in 2009, with fee revenues allocated to the Road Fund for maintenance of the project \nroad. The fee revenues will be sufficient to cover the estimated annual maintenance cost of the \nproject road to ensure sustainability. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n73.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n74.  Project Funding. The Government will ensure that all counterpart funds required for the \nProject are provided on a timely basis. \n \n75.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation. DOR will ensure that (i) baseline values for project \nimpact indicators are established before project implementation; (ii) findings on these indicators \nduring project implementation are incorporated in quarterly reports submitted to ADB; and  \n(iii) project impacts are monitored and evaluated through surveys at project completion and  \n3 years after completion, and findings are reported to ADB. \n \n76.  Road Maintenance.

Transport Modes \n \n1.  Mongolia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  railways,  roads,  air  transport,  and  inland \nwaterways. Railways are the dominant mode of transport, accounting for 97% of freight in ton-\nkilometers (TKM) and about 55% of passengers in passenger-kilometers (PKM). Road transport \ncarries most of the remaining traffic, accounting for about 3% of freight in TKM and 20% of \npassengers in PKM. Air transport is limited by poor quality, few operational airports, and high \ncost,  but  it  plays  a  key  role  in  providing  international  access  and  linking  the  otherwise \ninaccessible aimag (province) centers. The role of inland waterways is limited to a few lakes \n(e.g., Lake Khovsgol) located mainly in the northern part of the country. \n \n2.  The large share of railways is due to neither the relatively large geographic area, nor a \nwell-developed railway network in Mongolia. The railway network extends only 1,920 kilometers \n(km), primarily connecting Suhbaatar at the border with Russia to Zamyn-Uud at the border with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Mongolia\u2019s rail line density is 1.2 km per km2, lowest \namong the transition economies of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent \nSates. Compared with Mongolia, other transition economies have higher rail line densities, but \nlower share of rail transport.1 It appears that the higher share of railways in Mongolia is primarily \ndue to underdevelopment of its road network, which does not allow for efficient and competitive \nroad transport (para. 4). \n \n3.  Despite its relatively low share, road transport has the potential for rapid growth to meet \nthe  needs  of  a  reviving  economy.  As  Mongolia  moves  toward  a  free  market  system  and \ntransport demand becomes more diversified, the need for transport services with a greater \ndegree of reliability, flexibility, and efficiency will increase significantly. Road transport is better \nplaced than other transport modes to meet these demands. \n \nB.  The Road Sector \n \n1.  Road Network \n \n4.  Mongolia has a road network of about 49,250 km, connecting 21 major cities and towns \nas well as 160 smaller villages. The network comprises (i) 11,063 km of about 30 state roads \nthat connect Ulaanbaatar with aimag centers, major towns and border crossings; and (ii) 38,187 \nkm of local roads that link aimag centers with smaller villages. Only 12% of the roads (1,670 km) \nare paved, 13% (1,800 km) are gravel, and the remaining roads are earth tracks. Mongolia\u2019s \nroad network lags far behind that of other countries, including its neighbors. Road density (0.03 \nkm per km2) and the share of paved roads (3.4%) in Mongolia are both close to the lower end of \nthe countries in the world.2 Moreover, most of the road network is deteriorating and a large \nproportion  remains  impassable  during  the  rainy  or  winter  seasons  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, Kazakhstan has a rail line density of 5 km per km2, but its railways account for 94% of freight \ntransport in terms of TKM. \n2  The mid range values of road density and the share of paved roads in the world are 0.2 km per km2 and 45.5%, \nrespectively. World Bank. What Does the Average Road Sector Look Like? Washington, DC. \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n2.  Vehicle Ownership \n \n5.  Mongolia\u2019s registered vehicles (private vehicles in particular) have increased rapidly \nsince the mid-1990s due to economic recovery and progress on the transition to a market-based \nsystem. The average annual growth rate was 5.7% during 1994\u22122003 and it accelerated to \nabout 8% over the last 4 years. In 2003 Mongolia had 138,307 registered vehicles, comprising \n69,531 cars, 27,827 trucks, 26,361 motorcycles, 9,937 buses, and 4,651 trailers (Table A2.1). \nThe country\u2019s vehicle ratio was 45.5 vehicles (four and above wheels) per 1,000 persons, which \nwas close to the mid-value in the world (45.8 vehicles per 1,000 persons). The rise in vehicle \nownership, which is projected to continue in the foreseeable future, highlights the potential \ngrowth of road transport and requires improvement and expansion of the road network. \n \nTable A2.1: Registered Vehicles \n(unit) \n \nYear  Cars  Trucks  Buses  Motorcycles  Trailers     Total \n1991  11,890  29,813  1,928  43,552  9,110  96,293 \n1994  20,663  30,890  2,500  22,242  7,436  83,731 \n1997  35,578  30,528  3,982  26,114  7,170  103,372 \n2000  44,051  29,094  8,548  24,339  4,406  110,438 \n2003  69,531  27,827  9,937  26,361  4,651  138,307 \nSources: Traffic Police Department and National Statistical Yearbook, 1999 and 2002. \n \n  3.  Road Sector Institutions and Regulatory Framework \n \n6.  The Ministry of Infrastructure is responsible for overall transport planning, regulation, and \ncoordination. Within the ministry, the Policy and Coordination Department of Roads, Transport, \nand Tourism formulates transport policy, monitors its implementation, and liaises with external \naid  agencies.  Implementation  of  road  policy  and  operations  is  undertaken  by  the  Road \nTransport Agency and the Department of Roads (DOR). While the Road Transport Agency is \nresponsible for implementing policies and programs related to road transport operations, DOR is \nresponsible for construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of state roads. DOR is led by the \ndirector general and comprises a technical committee and four divisions, with permanent staff of \n61, of whom 41 are professional and 20 technical or administrative. In addition, 50 temporary \nemployees are assigned to externally financed projects. \n \n7.  The National Transport Advisory Committee, set up in February 1998 and reorganized in \nMarch 1999 and May 2000, monitors implementation of road sector policies. The committee is \nchaired by the director general of the Policy and Coordination Department of Roads, Transport, \nand Tourism of the Ministry of Infrastructure and comprises representatives of DOR; the Road \nTransport Agency; the State infrastructure Control Agency; Traffic Police Department; Urban \nTransport Coordination Department, National Transport Association; Trade Union for Workers of \nTransport, Communications, and Petroleum Companies; and state-owned road construction \nenterprises. \n \n8.  Mongolia\u2019s road sector policy is based mainly on the Road and Road Transport Sector \nPolicy Statement and two main pieces of legislation: the Road Act and the Road Transport Act, \nwhich were developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.3 The Road Act, which \nbecame effective on 1 February 1998, includes provisions for road sector organizations and \ninstitutional jurisdictions, road infrastructure classification and technical standards, and road \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Policy Support in the Road Sector. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2 27\nfinancing. The Road Transport Act, which took effect on 1 July 1999, focuses on licensing and \nregulatory aspects of the road transport industry. \n4.  Financial Management \n \n9.  The road sector is financed primarily through the Road Fund that was established in \n1991, controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and administered by DOR. Resource \nallocation of the Road Fund is part of the Government\u2019s budget process, and the Road Fund is \nfinanced mainly from the state budget and road user taxes. The state Road Fund revenues \nincreased from MNT6.4 billion ($6.3 million) in 1999 to MNT19.8 billion ($17.6 million) in 2003, \nwith the allocation from the state budget and road user taxes accounting for about 70% and \n30%,  respectively,  of  the  total.  The  state  Road  Fund  revenues  are  used  to  finance  road \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance,  as  well  as  serve  as  counterpart  funds  for \nexternally  assisted  road  projects.  During  1999\u22122003,  road  construction  and  rehabilitation \n(including counterpart funding for externally assisted projects) accounted for about 90% of total \nexpenditures. While the share of road maintenance in total expenditures rose from 5.8% in 1999 \nto 9.3% in 2003, expenses on equipment and research declined from 3.7% to 0.5% during the \nsame period (Table A2.2). \n \n10.  Despite the recent increases, total Road Fund revenues have been inadequate to meet \nroad sector funding requirements, which, ranged from 45% to 79% of the amount needed by \nDOR. According to a World Bank study,4 Mongolia\u2019s road sector requires a minimum annual \nfunding for capital investment and maintenance equivalent to 2.4% of GDP during 1999\u22122014. \nHowever, the actual funding during 1999\u22122003 accounted for less than 1% of GDP. Fiscal \ndeficits of the Government (3.6% of GDP in 2003) and a high external debt (103.7% of GDP in \n2003) are the primary factors limiting government funding for the road sector. The lack of an \nupdated  sector  strategy  also  exacerbates  the  problem  because  without  the  strategy  the \nGovernment is unable to allocate limited financial resources to priority projects on the basis of \nthe country\u2019s development strategy and sound technical and economic analyses. As a result, \npart  of  the  Road  Fund  revenues  has  been  used  for  unplanned  new  projects,  particularly \nconstruction of the millennium road. Moreover, despite increases in the retail price of gasoline \nand diesel, the fuel taxes have not been adjusted since 1995. Vehicle license fees have also not \nbeen  allocated  to  the  state  Road  Fund,  but  instead  have  been  appropriated  to  local \ngovernments for purposes not related to roads. \n \nTable A2.2: State Road Fund Revenues and Expenditures, 1999\u22122003 \n(MNT million) \nItem  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2003 \n(requested \nby DOR) \nRevenue  6,423.3  7,941.7  11,026.5  14,283.0  19,822.9  25,154.9 \n  State Budget  2,941.7  3,672.3  6,010.4  9,323.0  14,033.5   \n  Road User Taxes  3,481.0  4,222.0  4,654.8  4,839.6  5789.4   \n  Other Donations and Contributions  0.6  47.4  361.3  120.4  0.0   \nExpenditure  6,421.8  7,910.0  10,720.4  14,162.6  19,822.9   \n  Road Construction and Rehabilitation  2,225.4  2,379.5  3,491.9  8,203.9  13,387.1   \n  Counterpart Funds of Foreign Loan  3,539.3  3,843.7  4,772.3  3,452.4  4,468.6   \n     Projects \n  Road Maintenance  369.9  1,468.9  2,050.7  2,227.7  1,833.9  7,500.0 \n  Equipment  182.0  97.3  128.9  138.0  101.7   \n  Research   53.6  51.0  78.0  0.0  0.0   \n  Other  51.6  69.6  198.6  140.6  31.6   \nSource: Department of Roads. \n                                                 \n4  World  Bank.  1999.  Taming  the  Tyrannies  of  Distance  and  Isolation:  A  Transport  Strategy  for  Mongolia. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \n11.  As  a  recommendation  developed  with  ADB  technical  assistance,  the  Government \nestablished a Road Board in October 2003 to monitor operations of the Road Fund. The Road \nBoard  is  chaired  by  the  Scientific  Secretary  of  the  Transport  Institute  and  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  Ministries  of  Finance  and  Economy,  Infrastructure;  DOR;  Traffic  Police \nDepartment; major road transport companies, and transport nongovernment organizations. \n \n12.  The  Administration  and  Finance  Division  of  DOR  is  responsible  for  financial \nmanagement  of  road  sector  accounts,  including  preparing  the  budget  of  the  Road  Fund, \nmonitoring, and accounting of its revenues and expenditures as well as road sector projects \nimplemented by DOR. The division has eight staff members. With ADB technical assistance \n(footnote 3), DOR\u2019s financial management has improved. DOR has adopted accounting and \nauditing procedures according to the Law on Accounting (approved in 2002) and the State Audit \nLaw (approved in 2003), which are based on international accounting and auditing standards. \nDOR\u2019s performance in submitting audited project accounts and financial statements for ADB-\nassisted projects has been satisfactory. However, DOR\u2019s financial management capacity has \nbeen constrained due to inadequate provision of government budgets. Despite rapid increases \nin  road  investment  in  recent  years,  funding  allocated  from  the  state  budget  for  financial \nmanagement in DOR remains the same. The result is shortage of staff in the Administration and \nFinance Division. \n \n5.  Road Maintenance \n \n13.  Road maintenance funding has been inadequate to cover the needs of the road network. \nExpenditures on road maintenance from the state Road Fund increased from MNT370 million \n($0.4 million) in 1999 to MNT1.8 billion ($1.6 million) in 2003, but it accounted for about 25% of \nthe amount requested by DOR and less than 0.2% of GDP, and was lower than in many other \nAsian countries.5 Road maintenance funding from the Road Fund in 2004 increased significantly \nby more than 170% to MNT5.0 billion ($4.2 million). While this represented progress made on \nimproving road maintenance funding, continued efforts are needed to fully address this issue. \nInadequate funding for road maintenance will not prevent further deterioration of the road \nnetwork and remedy the accumulation of deferred maintenance. According to the Road Board, \nthe present conditions of the road network reach at best about 60% of the required level. \n \n14.  The problem of inadequate funding for road maintenance in Mongolia is similar to that \nexperienced in many other developing countries. Fiscal constraints have made it increasingly \ndifficult for the Government to provide adequate funds for the road sector. Within the road \nsector, priority is usually given to road construction and rehabilitation (including counterpart \nfunding  for  externally  assisted  projects).  Road  maintenance  should  be  excluded  from  the \ngovernment budget process and be funded primarily from road charges (e.g., road user taxes \nand fees) set at levels reflecting the costs that vehicles impose on the road system. \n \n15.  The  Government  recently  took  steps  to  increase  funding  for  road  maintenance. \nFollowing the substantial rise in road maintenance funding in 2004, the Government plans to \nfurther increase it to MNT5.5 billion in 2005. The establishment of the Road Board will help \nimprove the efficiency of Road Fund resources allocated for road maintenance. The Road \nBoard recommended to the Ministry of Finance and Economy in April 2004 that the Road Fund \nbe used primarily for road maintenance and that road maintenance funding be further increased. \nAs  a  first  step  in  encouraging  a  private  road  maintenance  industry,  the  Government  has \nremoved  route  maintenance  activities  from  state-owned  companies  or  joint  shareholding \n                                                 \n5  For example, the share of road maintenance expenditures to GDP was 1% in the PRC, 0.7% in Viet Nam, and \n0.5% in Kazakhstan in the early to mid-1990s (footnote 4). \n ", "Appendix 2 29\ncompanies. With support from the Nordic Development Fund, the Government is formulating a \nroad maintenance plan to provide a sustainable technical basis for the funds allocated for road \nmaintenance. In addition, road maintenance equipment was procured with funding from ADB \nand  the  World  Bank,  and  a  framework  for  the  management  and  operation  of  the  stock \nmaintenance equipment was established with ADB assistance. \n \n6.  Road Safety \n \n16.  Road accidents have increased significantly since the mid-1990s, with the total number \ngrowing from 860 in 1995 to 5,553 in 2002 (Table A2.3). The number of fatalities rose slightly, \nbut the number of injuries doubled during 1995\u22122002. The increase in road accidents in the \nurban areas (particularly in Ulaanbaatar) was more rapid than in the rural areas. Road accidents \nin the urban areas rose by about 750% during this period, compared with a 250% increase in \nthe rural areas. Road accident fatalities in the urban areas increased by 50%, while the number \nof deaths was relatively unchanged in the rural areas. However, road accidents in the rural \nareas rose significantly in 2002, accounting for two thirds of the total fatalities in the country. \nThe main reasons were poor driving skills, high speeds, intoxicated driving, careless behavior of \npedestrians, deficient road conditions, and technical problems with vehicles. \n \nTable A2.3: Road Traffic Accidents \n \nItem  1995 1997 1999 2000  2001  2002\nUrban Areas     \n  Accidents (no.)  513 794 4,330 5,074  4,398  4,358\n  Deaths (no.)  82 115 123 141  97  122\n  Injuries (no.)  476 826 930 940  878  818\nRural Areas     \n  Accidents (no.)  347 412 721 917  927  1,195\n  Deaths (no.)  212 194 173 197  238  205\n  Injuries (no.)  389 457 558 676  734  818\nTotal     \n  Accidents (no.)  860 1,206 5,051 5,991  5,325  5,553\n  Deaths (no.)  294 309 296 338  335  327\n  Injuries (no.)  865 1,283 1,488 1,616  1612  1,636\nSources: Traffic Police Department and National Statistical Yearbook, 1999 and 2002. \n \n17.  While the number of road accidents increased, the severity of accidents has decreased. \nThe fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles declined by 50% during 1995\u22122002. Deaths per accident \ndecreased  from  0.34  to  0.06,  and  injuries  from  1.01  to  0.29  during  the  same  period. \nNevertheless,  the  fatality  rate  for 2002  was about  24  persons  per 10,000  vehicles,  which \nremained  higher  than  in  many  other  Asian  countries.6  With  the  present  rate  of  growth  in \nvehicles, there is the potential for more road accidents. \n \n18.  Mongolia approved the Law on Road Safety and became a member of the International \nConvention on Road Signage in 1996. The Road Signage Standards were updated in 2003, \ntraffic safety regulations are being updated, and the standards on road marking and lighting are \nunder  review.  Road  safety  guidelines  were  developed  with  ADB  assistance.7  An  accident \nreporting system was revised and a vehicle inspection system developed and implemented with \nWorld  Bank  assistance.  Nevertheless,  road  safety  features  (e.g.,  markings,  signage,  and \nguardrails) are lacking on some road sections including the Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar section. \n                                                 \n6  For example, the road accident fatality rate in the PRC for 2001 was 17 persons per 10,000 vehicles. \n7  ADB. 1995. Regional Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \nMoreover, enforcement of traffic safety regulations is weak due to the limited capacity of the \nTraffic Police Department, as most traffic police officers have received neither appropriate \ntraining  nor  adequate  equipment  (e.g.,  patrol  vehicles,  breath  analyzers,  speed  monitoring \nequipment, and communication radios). Strong efforts are needed to (i) install safety features on \nall state roads, (ii) promote public awareness of traffic safety, (iii) strengthen the capacity of \ntraffic  police  officers  through  training,  and  (iv)  provide  the  Traffic  Police  Department  with \nequipment  such  as  patrol  vehicles  equipped  with  breath  analyzers  and  portable  speed \nmonitoring equipment, and two-way communication radios to enforce the implementation of \nroad traffic regulations. \n \nC.  Government Strategy and Priorities for the Road Sector \n \n19.  The  Government\u2019s  road  sector  strategy  aims  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  road \ntransport system and services to facilitate the country\u2019s economic and social development.  \nThe  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  favorable  environment  needed  for  developing  a \ncompetitive  road  transport  industry,  (ii)  increasing  investment  on  road  construction  and \nrehabilitation to reduce Mongolia\u2019s isolation from world markets and improve the accessibility of \nisolated  communities  within  the  country,  (iii)  increasing  funding  for  road  maintenance,  \n(iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, and (v) improving road safety. \n \n20.  While  important  progress  has  been  made  on  creating  a  favorable  climate  for  a \ncompetitive road transport industry, severe budgetary constraints have limited the progress on \nincreasing  funding  for  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  improving  road  safety. \nMoreover, the strategy should review the need to maintain and improve the existing road \nnetwork  in  areas  with  low  population  densities.  A  Road  Master  Plan  prepared  with  ADB \nassistance8 and approved by the Government identified priority road sections for investment and \nimprovement, but the Road Master Plan needs updating as many priority projects identified \nhave been constructed or are under construction. \n \n21.  The Government plans, with external assistance, to develop a new transport sector \nstrategy and update the Road Master Plan based on the country\u2019s development priority and the \navailability of financial resources. The new transport sector strategy will, among others, assess \ntotal  funding  requirements  to  maintain  the  existing  road  network,  identify  major  funding \nconstraints, and recommend how to address these constraints over the medium term. A working \ngroup, chaired jointly by ADB and the World Bank, was established in April 2004 to coordinate \nassistance to the Government in preparing the transport sector strategy. Over the medium term, \nthe  Government  accords  high  priority  to  developing  the  country\u2019s  two  key  road  corridors:  \n(i) a north-south corridor linking Mongolia with the PRC and Russia, and (ii) an east-west \ncorridor (i.e., the millennium road) linking several aimag centers with Ulaanbaatar. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995.

REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR AWARENESS AND \nPREVENTION OF HIV/AIDS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING \nA.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  Mongolia is at the early stage of HIV/AIDS1 epidemics with only four registered cases \ntransmitted mainly through sexual contact.2 However, the country is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS \ndiseases due to the high-risk behavior among young population, an increasing number of sex \nworkers with poor condom use, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and \nrapidly  growing  HIV/AIDS  diseases  in  neighboring  countries.  With  high  poverty  incidence, \nwomen  are  disproportionately  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  for  prostitution. \nSystematic trafficking cases have been reported.3 \n \n2.  The Regional Road Development Project will build the remaining section of Mongolia\u2019s \nnorth-south road transport corridor between Choyr and the border with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) in Zamyn-Uud4 to link the Asian highway networks of the PRC and Russia.  \nThe Project can have a significant impact on the spread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \nbecause  of  a  large  number  of  workers  employed  during  construction  and  the  increased \nmovement of passengers across the borders with the PRC and Russia after project completion.5 \nThe technical assistance (TA) will mitigate potential risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human \ntrafficking along the north-south road corridor. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n3.  The goal of the TA is to reduce the risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking that may be \nassociated with the construction of the project road and operation of the north-south road \ntransport  corridor  after  project  completion.  The  purposes  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  raise  public \nawareness of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; (ii) address the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission \namong construction workers, sex workers, local communities, truck drivers, and other road \nusers; and (iii) strengthen border control capacity against human trafficking.  \n \n4.  To achieve these objectives, the short-term strategy will focus on (i) creating awareness \nof HIV/AIDS including the transmission channel of drug use, and human trafficking among \nconstruction workers, sex workers, and local communities; (ii) promoting behavior change;  \n(iii) promoting use of condoms; (iv) implementing STI/HIV/AIDS prevention services, including \nSTI treatment and voluntary counseling and testing services at construction camps and in local \ncommunities; and (v) enhancing STI/HIV/AIDS monitoring. The long-term strategy will focus on \n(i) building HIV/AIDS prevention capacity of communities along the north-south road and at \nborders;  (ii)  promoting  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  among  business \ncommunities  (particularly  construction  companies,  transport  operators,  and  hotels),  border \nauthorities, and media; and (iii) strengthening border control and establishing a regional network \namong Mongolia, the PRC, and Russia for prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.  \nThe TA will contribute to the achievement of the long-term strategy. \n                                                 \n1 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS estimates that about 300 persons might be infected with HIV in \nMongolia by the end of 2003.  \n3  An attempted trafficking of over 400 Mongolian girls was recently reported in the UB Post on 30 January 2004. \n4  In 2001, there were 1.4 million inbound and outbound passengers in Mongolia, of whom 50% traveled via Zamyn-\nUud, 16% via Suhbaatar, and the rest through other border posts. \n5 Mobile populations are among the main transmitters of HIV/AIDS infection. Construction workers, transport workers, \ntruck drivers, and traders compose key mobile groups.   ", " 44 Appendix 11 \n5.  The TA will be built on the ongoing efforts of the Government and United Nations \nagencies, particularly the World Health Organization and the Global Fund for Fight against \nHIV/AIDS.6 In particular, technical capacity and coordination mechanisms are available to share \nfor  TA  implementation.  The  TA  will  complement  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  covenant  that  causes \ncontractors  to  disseminate  information  on  HIV/AIDS/STIs  to  the  workers  employed  during \nproject implementation and allow employees to attend health education, to be tested, or to \nreceive basic treatment; and (ii) the area development component of the Project. \n \n6.  The TA comprises five components to be undertaken at construction sites along the \nnorth-south road corridor and at borders: \n \n(i)  Advocacy  workshops.  To  improve  understanding  of  the  awareness  and \nprevention program on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking among stakeholders, \nadvocacy  workshops  will  be  conducted.  The  workshops  will  target  local \ngovernments  and  communities,  owners  of  hotels  and  entertainment \nestablishments,  relevant  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  transport \noperators,  business  communities,  media,  local  police,  road  construction \ncompanies and contractors, and the aimag branches of the Department of Roads \n(DOR) along the north-south road, and border and custom offices.  \n \n(ii)  Support for in-depth behavior change. Intensive health education campaigns \nand  peer  education  will  be  undertaken  to  promote  behavior  change  among \nconstruction  workers,  sex  workers,  and  local  people  in  the  project  area. \nKnowledge will be disseminated through posters, pamphlets, focus groups, and \nlaunch events in Mongolian and Chinese languages7 during construction and \nafter  the  opening  of  the  project  road.  NGOs  will  be  identified  to  facilitate \neducation for sex workers. The National AIDS Foundation will help the aimag \nhealth departments organize peer education through sensitization workshops, \ninitial training, and regular monitoring visits.8 Condoms will be made available \nfree of charge or at low prices during the first 2 years of construction of the \nproject road. \n \n(iii)  Comprehensive  medical  package. The TA will supervise STI treatments at \nconstruction camps, conduct training for health workers on STI management and \nVCT services, and provide STI drugs to cover excess needs that might arise from \nroad  construction.9 HIV  testing  kits  will  be  provided  to  construction  areas.  \nAimag health departments and the National Center for Communicable Disease \nControl will supervise the performance of health workers and provide supplies.10  \n \n(iv)  Border  control  and  cross-border  cooperation  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking.11 This comprises four subcomponents: (a) Training will be \nconducted to strengthen the capacity of border officers against HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking.  Training  will  be  first  organized  at  the  national  level  for \ngovernment  officials  and  relevant  NGOs,  and  then  at  border  offices.  \n                                                 \n6  This includes information and education campaigns, STI services, the 100% condom use program, provision of \nVCT services, surveillance systems, and regional cooperation on fight against HIV/AIDS. \n7  More than half of construction workers in Mongolia are Chinese.  \n8  The Global Fund has used this operational modality for peer education nationwide. \n9  The national health system will provide STI treatments free of charge or at low prices to insured people. \n10 The Global Fund has used this operational modality for medical support nationwide. \n11 ADB is contacting other aid agencies for possible funding for the same activities in Russia. ", "Appendix 11   45\n(b) International consultants will be engaged to work with relevant government \nagencies, local institutes such as the Center for Human Rights and Development, \nand NGOs for capacity building. (c) Workshops will be organized for participants \nfrom Mongolia and the PRC to discuss the possibility of establishing cross-border \ncooperation  mechanisms  and  exchange  information  on  the  fight  against \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. (d) Basic equipment will be provided to help \nborder offices identify and register suspects. \n \n(v)  Benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  system  in  construction  areas.  \nA BME system will be set up to strengthen the existing surveillance systems. The \nBME system will accommodate the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) need for \nproject performance and monitoring. In addition to performance indicators, sexual \nbehavior, treatment-seeking behavior, and prevalence of STI will be monitored. \nSurveys will be conducted to collect baseline data and assess progress. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n7.  The estimated costs of the TA and the proposed financing plan are given in Table A11.1. \nADB financing will be funded from its TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining  local  currency  cost  by  providing  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  workshop \nfacilities. \n \nTable A11.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \nItem    Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The economic analysis1 of the Project was based on a comparison of with- and without- \nproject cases. The analysis uses 2003 economic prices2 and covers the period of 2006\u22122025, \ncomprising 3 years of construction and 17 years of operation. \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n2.  Traffic forecasts for the project road were made for 2006\u22122025. A three-stage process \nwas used for making traffic forecasts:  \n \n(i)  Initial traffic forecasts were based on an analysis of macro level demographic \nand economic trends for Mongolia, as well as for the corridor between Choyr and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) border in Zamyn-Uud. \n \n(ii)  Macro  level  forecasts  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  between  Choyr  and \nZamyn-Uud were disaggregated into road and rail transport, based on the data \ngathered from interviews, traffic surveys, and published reports and statistics on \nrecent and anticipated modal shares. \n \n(iii)  Based on traffic survey data and actual traffic patterns along the project road, \nroad  traffic projections were  further  disaggregated  into  three  types  of  traffic:  \n(a) normal traffic, or existing traffic in the absence of the Project, (b) generated \ntraffic,  or  traffic  that  develops  due  to  reduced  transport  costs  or  increased \nbusiness activities in the project area, and (c) diverted traffic, or traffic that is \ndiverted from the existing railway to the project road. \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and population are projected to grow by 4.5% \nand 0.95% per annum, respectively, during 2006\u22122025. GDP and population growth projections \nare largely in line with recent growth rates. Based on economic and demographic growth \nprojections, traffic for the corridor between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud is forecast \nto grow by 6.3% for freight traffic in ton-kilometers (TKM) and 5.1% for passenger traffic in \npassenger-kilometers (PKM) per annum during 2006\u22122025 (Table A12.1). The growth rate of \nprojected traffic is higher than that of GDP because the transport intensity of the economy has \nincreased in recent years with freight transport intensity growing at a faster rate than passenger \ntransport intensity.3 \n \n4.  Transport between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud is by road and rail. Based on the existing \nmodal shares and an analysis of traffic patterns derived from traffic surveys,4 projected corridor \ntraffic was disaggregated into road and rail modes (Table A12.1). The railway is projected to \nremain the dominant mode of transport, although its shares in terms of TKM and PKM are \nexpected to decrease gradually. The road is projected to attract traffic, particularly passenger \ntraffic from 2009, the first year of operation of the project road. The road\u2019s share is projected to \nincrease from 3.7% to 23.8% in PKM and 0.4% to 5.8% in TKM during 2006\u22122025.  \n                                                 \n1 The economic analysis covers Mongolia only and does not take into account the project benefits accruing to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. \n2 The feasibility study was completed at the end of 2003.  \n3  Freight transport intensity tripled from 1.99 to 5.96 TKM of GDP, while passenger transport intensity increased by \n63.8% from 1.16 to 1.90 PKM of GDP during 1995\u22122002. \n4  Factors such as commodity type, distance, and cost for freight transport, and distance and cost for passenger \ntransport were used to project traffic for rail and road modes along the corridor between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud.

Based on the projected corridor traffic, traffic surveys5 conducted along the project road \nalignment in August\u2212September 2003, and the data provided by the Department of Roads, \ntraffic forecasts for with- and without- project cases were made (Table A12.2). In the without-\nproject case, traffic would continue to move along the existing multiple unimproved earth tracks \n(normal traffic). The average daily traffic (ADT) will remain relatively low, from 288 vehicles in \n2006 to 864 vehicles in 2025. In the with-project case, ADT will increase significantly from 2009 \nsince the road will create diverted and generated traffic. ADT is projected to grow from 288 \nvehicles in 2006 to 3,075 vehicles in 2025. Regional traffic (i.e., traffic from and to Mongolia and \ntransit traffic via Mongolia) is projected to constitute the bulk of total traffic, with its share \ngrowing from 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n \nB.  Alternatives Analysis \n \n6.  There are four ways of meeting the projected road traffic between Choyr and Zamyn-\nUud: (i) construction of a asphalt concrete road; (ii) construction of a road with double bitumen \nsurface treatment (DBST) surface; (iii) construction of a gravel road; and (iv) expansion of the \ncapacity  of  the  existing  railway  instead  of  constructing  the  project  road,  given  that  the \npreliminary alignment for the project road roughly parallels the railway line. An alternatives \nanalysis was undertaken to select the most appropriate project alternative. \n \n7.  Costs and benefits of the project alternatives used a domestic price numeraire with a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.07 (based on the 2002 data) to estimate foreign exchange \neffects. Costs were divided into tradable and nontradable materials, equipment, skilled labor, \nand unskilled labor. A composite conversion factor of 1.0078 was used to express the Project\u2019s \ncapital  costs  as  economic  costs  (Table  A12.3  explains  the  computation  of  the  composite \n                                                 \n5  The surveys included (i) traffic counts and origin-destination surveys conducted in August 2003 along the project \nroad alignment, (ii) vehicle axle load survey conducted in September 2003 along the project road alignment,  \n(iii) border survey conducted in August 2003 at the Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian Hot post, and (iv) survey of road-based \nbusiness establishments conducted in September 2003 along the Ulaanbaatar-Darhan road. ", " 50 Appendix 12 \nconversion factor). A shadow wage rate factor of 0.76 was used to estimate the economic price \nof unskilled workers, considering that if unemployed people are hired under the Project, their \neconomic opportunity costs would likely be zero or close to zero. Skilled workers are not \nshadow priced since there is no surplus of skilled workers in Mongolia. Costs for the road \noptions comprise costs of construction and maintenance, while costs for the railway option \ncomprises costs of additional investment, maintenance, and operating costs. The opportunity \ncost of land is assumed to be zero since the land along the alignment is low in quality with no \nalternative beneficial use. \n \nTable A12.2: Projected Average Daily Traffic between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud \n       \nYear  Without  With Project \nProject  Normal  Generated  Diverted  Total Traffic \nDomestic  Traffic  Transit  Total \nfrom/to  Traffic via \nMongolia  Mongolia \n2006  288  288  0  0  201  76  11  288 \n2007  305  305  0  0  216  77  12  305 \n2008  322  322  0  0  225  84  13  322 \n2009  341  341  34  974  332  628  389  1,349 \n2010  361  361  36  1,021  350  653  415  1,418 \n2011  382  382  38  1,089  371  696  442  1,509 \n2012  405  405  41  1,151  393  732  472  1,597 \n2013  429  429  43  1,215  415  770  502  1,687 \n2014  454  454  45  1,282  438  806  537  1,781 \n2015  481  481  48  1,351  462  846  572  1,880 \n2016  509  509  51  1,423  487  885  611  1,983 \n2017  540  540  54  1,523  517  948  652  2,117 \n2018  572  572  57  1,601  546  990  694  2,230 \n2019  607  607  61  1,683  577  1,033  741  2,351 \n2020  643  643  64  1,769  608  1,078  790  2,476 \n2021  682  682  68  1,834  638  1,104  843  2,585 \n2022  723  723  72  1,900  669  1,130  896  2,695 \n2023  767  767  77  1,971  704  1,158  953  2,815 \n2024  814  814  81  2,045  739  1,189  1,013  2,941 \n2025  864  864  86  2,125  778  1,220  1,077  3,075 \nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n \nTable A12.3: Computation of Composite Conversion Factor \n  \nItem  Share within  Conversion  Share of Project  Weighted \nCategory (%)  Factor  Cost (%)  Value \nMaterials      35.0   \n  Tradable Materials (i.e., cement, steel)  40.0  1.07    0.1498 \n  Nontradable Materials (i.e., gravel, sand)  60.0  1.00    0.2100 \nLabor      25.0   \n  Skilled Labor  60.0  1.00    0.1500 \n  Unskilled Labor  40.0  0.70    0.0700 \nEquipment      40.0   \n  Tradable Equipment        100.0  1.07    0.4280 \n  Nontradable Equipment   0.0  1.00    0.0000 \nComposite Conversion Factor        1.0078 \nSource: Technical assistance consultant.  \n \n                                                 \n6  A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) is the ratio between its shadow wage rate and its price (Appendix 12 of \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects). The SWRF of 0.7 is calculated based on the assumption that the \naverage  monthly  wage  for  project  labor  is  MNT80,000  while  the  shadow  wage  rate  for  unskilled  labor  is \nMNT56,000 (the average of the wages to employees of MNT50,000 and MNT62,000 inclusive of taxes).    ", "Appendix 12   51\n8.  Economic benefits consist of savings on transport costs and travel time for freight and \npassenger traffic, which are valued in terms of (i) vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings for \nnormal traffic, (ii) difference in cost and travel time of using the railway and the project road for \ndiverted traffic, and (iii) 50% of VOC savings from normal traffic as proxy for willingness to pay \nfor generated traffic. Transport cost savings embody the value of time saved by vehicle drivers \nand crews, but not by passengers or cargo. The value of time saved by passengers traveling to \nwork was calculated at $0.50 per hour. For passengers traveling for leisure, 25% of the value of \nthe work time saved is used as proxy for willingness to pay for a nonbusiness trip. The value of \ntime saved for freight is estimated at $0.16 per ton per day, based on an average value of $500 \nper ton at a 12% opportunity cost of capital. \n \n9.  The alternatives analysis was carried out in two phases. On the first level, the three \nalternatives for the project road were compared to determine the appropriate type of road \nsurface. The results (Table A12.4) show that the gravel road option has the lowest value, with \nan economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 26.4% and net present value (NPV) of $68.2 \nmillion. In terms of EIRR, the highest value is for the DBST road option (30.4%) and the second \nhighest value is for the asphalt concrete road option (29.7%). In terms of NPV, the asphalt \nconcrete road option ($131.3 million) shows a higher value than the DBST road option ($121.9 \nmillion). In view of NPV and given that the project road forms part of the Asian highway network \nand other sections of the north-south road corridor between Altanbulag and Choyr are asphalt \nconcrete, the asphalt concrete road option appears a better choice than the DBST option.  \nOn the second level, comparison is made between the asphalt concrete road option and the \nrailway option. The results show that the railway alternative has a lower EIRR value (19.7%) \nand NPV ($59.1 million), and is thus less economically feasible. Based on the alternatives \nanalysis, development of an asphalt concrete road between Choyr and the PRC border in \nZamyn-Uud is the economically efficient option for increasing transport capacity on this corridor.

Benefits of the Project \n \n10.  The Project\u2019s primary benefit is transport cost savings due to the improved road surface \nroughness7 and resultant increases in vehicle speeds. Transport cost savings are estimated to \naccount for 96% of the total project benefits. For nine types of vehicles, the Project is expected \nto result in an average VOC reduction of 43.1% per unit traveling between Choyr and the PRC \nborder in Zamyn-Uud, ranging between 36.1% per car and 45.5% per heavy bus (Table A12.5). \nThe benefits from VOC savings, which initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will be \nshared  gradually  with  users  of  road  transport  services  through  reduced  freight  rates  and \npassenger fares. \n \nTable A12.5: Vehicle Operating Cost by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle per trip)  \n \nItem  Without Project  With Project  VOC Savings  Savings (%) \nCar  95.5    61.0    34.5    36.1   \nJeep  197.0    119.4    77.5    39.3   \nLight Truck  246.3    143.2    103.2    41.9   \nMedium Truck  359.3    203.4    156.0    43.4   \nHeavy Truck  549.1    310.3    238.9    43.5   \nArticulated Truck  767.3    422.8    344.5    44.9   \nLight Bus  224.5    134.9    89.6    39.9   \nMedium Bus  338.4    195.1    143.2    42.3   \nHeavy Bus  403.8    220.2    183.6    45.5   \nAverage  353.5    201.1    152.4    43.1   \nVOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n11.  The project benefits include savings on travel time because of the relatively straight \nalignment of the project road and increased vehicle speeds. The Project is expected to reduce \nthe average travel time between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud by 56%, from 13.4 \nhours to 5.9 hours per trip (Table A12.6). The Project will contribute to reduce road accidents, \nbut such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not included in the economic analysis.  \nThe Project is not designed to alleviate traffic congestion since congestion is generally not a \nconcern in Mongolia\u2019s road sector, except for Ulaanbaatar during the rush hours on workdays. \n \nTable A12.6: Average Travel Time by Vehicle Type \n(hours per vehicle per trip) \n \nItem  Without Project  With Project  Time Savings  Savings (%)  \nCar  12.4    5.3    7.1    57.3   \nJeep  12.4    5.3    7.1    57.3   \nLight Truck  13.0    6.0    7.0    53.8   \nMedium Truck  13.0    6.1    6.9    53.1   \nHeavy Truck  14.1    6.1    8.0    56.7   \nArticulated Truck  15.6    6.5    9.1    58.3   \nLight Bus  12.6    5.5    7.1    56.3   \nMedium Bus  13.1    6.1    7.0    53.4   \nHeavy Bus  14.1    6.2    7.9    56.0   \nAverage  13.4    5.9    7.5    56.0   \nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n7  The Project will significantly improve the road surface roughness between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-\nUud, with the reduction in its international roughness index value from the present 20\u221222 to 2\u22123. \n ", " 56 Appendix 12 \nD.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to identify the parameters to which the EIRR of the \nProject is sensitive. The results (Table A12.7) indicate that the EIRR of the Project exceeds the \ncutoff level of 12%, except when (i) the Project\u2019s capital costs increase by 214%, (ii) road \nmaintenance costs increase by 1,139%, (iii) the surface roughness of the project road during the \ndry season increase by 175%, and (iv) traffic growth or user benefits are reduced by 66%.  \nEven when diverted traffic is reduced by 100%, the cutoff level of 12% will not be reached. \nEliminating routine and periodic maintenance on the project road will cause deterioration of road \nconditions, which will significantly reduce user benefits because of increased VOC. An increase \nin  the  roughness  index  of  the  project  road  to  19.8  will  reduce  the  EIRR  to  12%.  A  high \nroughness  coefficient  can  only  be  experienced  if  the  project  road  is  not  maintained  for  a \nconsiderable  period  of  time.  This  is  unlikely  to  occur  because  appropriate  measures  are \nincluded in the Project to ensure that adequate funding is available for maintenance of the \nproject road. \n \nTable A12.7: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nItem  EIRR (%)  Switching Value (%)a \nBase Case  29.7      \nCapital Cost Increase by 50%  22.4   214   \nMaintenance Cost Increase by 100%  28.7   1,139   \nNormal Daily Traffic Decrease by 100%  19.1   .   \nDiverted Traffic Decrease by 75%  19.7      \nGenerated Traffic Decrease by 100%  28.8      \nTraffic Growth Decrease by 50%  17.4   66   \nDry Season Road Surface Roughness Decrease by 175%  12.0   175   \nUser Benefits Decrease by 25%  24.1   66   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \na \nFactors applied to the best estimate for each cost/benefit item to reduce the EIRR to the 12% per annum threshold. \nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n \nE.  Risk Analysis \n \n13.  Risk analysis examined the probability distribution of the estimated EIRR and NPV of the \nProject. Within the assumed range of parameter estimates, the probability that the EIRR of the \nProject or NPV of the Project is negative is 26%. The median EIRR of the Project is 14.7%, with \na range of 0.5%\u221231.5%, and the medium NPV amounts to $22.7 million, with a range of \nnegative $110.9 million to $152.2 million. \n \nF.  Distribution Analysis \n \n14.  Distribution analysis was based on trade statistics and the data collected from interviews \nand surveys of passengers, freight companies, and customs officials. Two types of distribution \nanalysis were carried out to assess the distribution of project benefits: (i) among regional \neconomies, and (ii) among various stakeholders within Mongolia. The results are summarized in \nTable A12.8. The Project will result in total net project benefits of $268.3 million, comprising \n$235.7 million for Mongolia, $29.4 million for the PRC, and $3.2 million for Russia. Based on the \nproximity and established traffic patterns, 90% and 10% of the project benefits that do not \naccure to Mongolia are distributed between the PRC and Russia, respectively. Mongolia will \naccount for 87.8% of total project benefits, while the PRC and Russia are expected to receive \n11% and 1.2% of total benefits, respectively.  \n ", "Appendix 12   57\n \n15.

No    No \nagreement? \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia:  \nMongolia is a landlocked country with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $505 in 2003. The Government\u2019s \npoverty standard reflects subsistence living and is based on a fixed minimum income equivalent ranging from $0.56 \nper day in western Mongolia to $0.90 per day in Ulaanbaatar, the nation\u2019s capital. Approximately 21.6% of the \npopulation  in  the  project  area  (Govisumber  and  Dornogovi  aimags)  live  below  the  poverty  line  according  to \ngovernment estimates. The Project will provide reliable all-weather access to the poor towns and help reduce poverty \nin the area through (i) improved links to domestic and world markets; (ii) increased quality, quantity, and variety of \ngoods; (iii) increased job and income opportunities; (iv) improved market information and infrastructure for sales, \nwarehousing, and distribution; (v) increased private sector investments; (vi) reduced transport time and cost of goods; \nand (vii) increased options for personal travel. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Other \nPoverty in Mongolia is primarily income-based, with a high incidence of transient poverty\u2014those who live near the \npoverty line. According to local government data, about 21.6% of the people in the villages along the alignment are \npoor, of whom 7% are very poor. People living in transient poverty are vulnerable to external shocks, as they have \nlimited savings, job skills, and social protection against job loss. The official unemployment rate for the project area is \nabout 18.4% (Census 2002), while the project household survey indicated an unemployment rate of over 25%. The \ntransition from a socialist to a market economy caused many Mongolians in the public sector and state-owned \nenterprises to lose their jobs. Some have successfully made a transition to the private sector, but others have fallen \ninto poverty due to a lack of job opportunities. The cold weather conditions in the past years caused herders to lose \ntheir herds and migrate to the towns.  \n \n \nThe Project will improve the road transport infrastructure needed for pro-poor economic growth. Construction of the \nproject road and the components of cross-border road transport facilitation, road safety, and area development \nprovide a comprehensive approach to maximizing project benefits to people in the project area. The project road will \npromote economic growth and poverty reduction by improving economic efficiency, fostering trade, and facilitating \nregional cooperation. Competition with the existing parallel railway will contribute to reducing passenger and freight \nprices. Lower transport costs will help lower the prices of daily necessities in local markets and enhance income-\nearning opportunities.  \n \nConstruction of the project road will increase local expenditures, jobs, and tax revenues that could be used for \nimproving social infrastructure and services. The area development component comprises (i) construction of four \naccess roads, (ii) training local laborers for road construction and maintenance jobs, (iii) establishment of a pilot \nroadside station, and (iv) the continued stakeholder participation process that includes enhancing small business and \nskills development. By supporting local area development, the Project will promote regionally balanced economic \ngrowth  and  social  development.  The  road  safety  improvement  component  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nawareness and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and \nhuman trafficking will be implemented along the north-south road corridor to mitigate potential social risks and \nstrengthen the positive social and poverty reduction impacts of the Project. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nStakeholder analysis during project preparation helped identify the key project stakeholders and their interests. \nNumerous consultation meetings were held with government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), local \ncommunities, road construction and maintenance companies, and other external aid agencies. A household survey of \n3% of the project area population was conducted in the villages along the project road alignment. Stakeholder \nconsultations were useful in drawing lessons from previous projects: (i) a local training program on road construction \nwill help achieve local employment targets; and (ii) a wide right-of-way along the project road will help prevent \nencroachment along the alignment and subsequent strip development and reduce traffic accidents. Consultation with \nlocal governments was essential to reaching agreement on the road alignment and the need for access roads. \nDiscussions with NGOs confirmed the need to expand the traffic safety component to cover the entire north-south \ncorridor, and to strengthen the human trafficking subcomponent of the TA. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \nA stakeholder participation process is included in the area development component. The process will focus on (i) \ncontinued stakeholder meetings for project design and implementation; (ii) assistance in conducting training for road \nconstruction and maintenance, including good working conditions; (iii) enhanced small business skills and related job \n ", " 60 Appendix 13 \ncreation, especially for the poor; (iv) development of a pilot roadside station; (v) facilitation of the implementation of the \nroad  safety  improvement  component  among  traffic  police  officers  and  local  communities;  (vi)  involvement  of \nhouseholds interested in road maintenance; (vii) assistance with awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking; and (viii) community-based environmental enhancement and monitoring. Aimag and soum governments will \ncoordinate with the Department of Roads (DOR) during project implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTraditionally, Mongolia has been a patriarchal society with sharp gender division of responsibilities where women have \nplayed a subordinate role. During the socialist period (1921- 1990), the Government was committed to gender \nequality. Women had equal opportunity for education and gained considerable ground in employment and political \nparticipation. As Mongolia moves toward a market economy, women begin to face greater difficulty in the labor \nmarket, at home, and in politics. With higher education, wives achieve a higher status than their husbands. The \nsituation lead to friction and instability in marriages. About 30% household heads are women.  \n \nA gender plan is not necessary, as measures to promote women\u2019s participation and mitigate potentially negative \nimpacts on women are integrated into various project components and assurances.  Through the stakeholder \nparticipation process under the area development component, the needs of women and other vulnerable groups will \nbe addressed. The Project will encourage women\u2019s participation in planning and developing the pilot roadside station. \nWomen will benefit from the Project and will have equal access to project-created jobs and wages. The Project will \ngenerate additional revenue, which can be used to improve social infrastructure and services.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes   No \n \nE.
