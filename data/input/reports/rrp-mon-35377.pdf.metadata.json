The PSC \nwill meet at least once every 6 months and ADB will participate as \nobserver. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up within \nDOR to take responsibility for implementation activities on a day-\nto-day  basis.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director,  who \nwill  be  assisted  by  two  full-time  project  managers  and  a  team  of \nqualified  technical,  financial,  and  administrative  staff  during \nproject implementation. \n \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the project road \n(including \nto  Saynshand  and  vegetation \nplanting)  and  the  access  road  to  Orgon  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  or  relevant  bilateral  agreements. \nBecause the civil works contracts will cost less than $1 million and \ndomestic  contractors  are  capable  of  undertaking  such  works,  at \nthe  Government\u2019s  request  local  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  for  the  access \nroad  to  Erdene  and  the  provision  of  safety  features  on  the \nAltanbulag-Ulaanbaatar \ntwo-way \ncommunication  radios,  and  the  vehicle  weight  mat  will  be \nprocured  following  direct  purchase  or  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. \n \nAdvance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  was  approved  on \n14 April 2004. \n \nA  total  of  1,158  person-months  of  consulting  services  (177.5 \ninternational and 980.5 domestic) will help implement the Project. \nConsultants  will  undertake  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision,  strengthen  project  management, \nimprove  road \nsafety, assist in implementing the area development plan and the \ncross-border road transport facilitation plan, and help monitor and \nevaluate project impacts. The Government will finance consulting \nservices for detailed design, while ADB will finance the remaining \nconsulting  services.  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  recruited \naccording  to  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  of \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n \n\nsection.  Patrol \n\nvehicles, \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\fThe Project will benefit the people living along the road corridor in \nMongolia  (about  48,400  based  on  the  2003  population),  road \ntransport  operators  and  users,  construction  companies,  traders, \nand other people who derive income from expanded traffic, trade, \nand  investment  in  the  region.  The  major  benefits  will  be  in  the \nform  of  improved  trade  and  transit,  and  significantly  reduced \ntransaction  costs  among  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  Russia,  and  other \ntrading  partners.  Major  direct  benefits  will  be  lower  transport \ncosts,  faster  and  more  reliable  road  transport  services,  and  job \nand  income  opportunities  created  during  project  implementation \n(i.e.,  use  of  local  labor  and  construction  materials)  or  along  the \nproject  road  after  project  completion.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ncreate  about  1,800  jobs  on  road  construction  and  maintenance, \nand  income  amounting  to  MNT3.4  billion  ($2.9  million)  for \nMongolians. The Project\u2019s economic internal return is estimated at \n29.7%.  Indirect  benefits  will  be  increased  business  and  job \nopportunities  in  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  which  have \nbackward or forward linkages to the Project. \n \nThe  Project  has  three  potential  risks.  First,  implementation  may \nbe  delayed  due  to  DOR\u2019s  limited  experience  in  managing \nconstruction of a relatively long road. This risk will be mitigated by \nprovision of consulting services and advance procurement action. \nSecond, counterpart funds may not be provided on a timely basis. \nADB  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  that \nsufficient  counterpart  funds  for  the  Project  are  allocated  in  a \ntimely  manner.  Third,  maintenance  of  the  project  road  after \ncompletion  may  be  inadequate  due  to  insufficient  funding. \nThis  risk  will  be  mitigated  mainly  through  the  establishment  of  a \nfacility  in  Zamyn-Uud  to  collect  vehicles  fees  beginning  in  2009, \nwith  fee  revenues  to  be  allocated  to  the  Road  Fund  for \nmaintaining the project road. The fee revenues will be sufficient to \ncover the annual maintenance cost of the project road to ensure \nsustainability. \n \nThe  proposed  TA  for  $350,000  equivalent,  to  be  financed  from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program on a grant basis, will accompany the \nloan to create public awareness and take preventive measures to \nreduce  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  and  human  trafficking \non the north-south road corridor.  \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Regional Road Development Project (the Project). The report also describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Awareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS1  and  Human \nTrafficking, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES2 \n\n2. \nThe Project will develop the remaining section of Mongolia\u2019s north-south road transport \ncorridor  between  Choyr  and  the  border  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  in  Zamyn-\nUud. The Project is classified as a regional project for the following reasons. First, the corridor \nconstitutes a part of the Asian highway network (Route 3)3 linking the road systems of the PRC \nand the Russian Federation (Russia) and passing through major economic centers of Mongolia. \nSecond,  regional  traffic  (i.e.,  traffic  from  or  to  Mongolia  and  transit  traffic  via  Mongolia)  is \nprojected  to  account  for  about  75%  of  total  corridor  traffic  during  2009\u22122025;  therefore  the \ncorridor will serve as an important route for domestic and international transit traffic, promoting \ntrade  and  reducing  transaction  costs  among  countries  in  the  region.  Third,  the  Project  will \ncomplement ongoing negotiations on the draft Transit Traffic Framework Agreement among the \nPRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  which  are  expected  to  be  concluded  soon.4  The  Mongolian \nGovernment  has  accorded  the  Project  high  priority  and  has  sought  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nMongolia\u2019s road sector is underdeveloped and is unable to fulfill its objective of fostering \neconomic and social development. A detailed road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. The main \nfeatures of the sector are summarized as follows: \n \n\nThe  country  has  a  road  network  of  about  49,250  kilometers  (km),  comprising \n11,063 km of state roads and 38,187 km of local roads. Only 12% of the roads \n(1,670  km)  are  paved,  13%  (1,800  km)  are  gravel,  and  75%  are  earth  roads. \nRoad density (0.03 km per km2) and the share of paved roads (3.4%) are low. \n\nRoad transport carries only about 3% of freight in ton-kilometers (TKM) and less \nthan 20% of passengers in passenger-kilometers (PKM). \n\nRegistered vehicles (private vehicles in particular) increased rapidly by about 6% \nper  annum  during  1994\u20132003  due  to  economic  recovery  and  progress  on  the \ntransition  to  a  market-based  system.  In  2003  Mongolia  had  138,307  registered \nvehicles with a ratio of 45.5 vehicles per 1,000 persons, which was close to the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n1  AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \n2  A project preparatory technical assistance was provided to prepare the feasibility study on this project. \n3  The concept of the Asian highway network that the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe  Pacific  has  been  promoting  took  a  significant  step  forward  when  31  regional  countries  including  Mongolia \nsigned in April 2004 in Shanghai, PRC an agreement on the network\u2019s development. \n\n4  The PRC, Mongolia, and Russia began negotiations on the draft Transit Traffic Framework Agreement in 2000 with \nassistance from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Five negotiating meetings have been \nheld. ADB participated in the Fifth Negotiating Meeting in Qingdao, PRC on 14\u221215 January 2004. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\nmid  value  in  the  world.5  Registered  vehicles  in  the  project  area  were  3,137  in \n2003,  with  a  ratio  of  64.8  vehicles  per  1,000  persons.  The  rapid  increase  in \nvehicle  ownership,  which  is  projected  to  continue  in  the  foreseeable  future, \nhighlights  the  potential  growth  of  road  transport  and  requires  expansion  and \nimprovement of the road network. \n\n(iv) \n\nRoad sector funding through the Road Fund6 has been inadequate, ranging from \n45  to  79%  of  the  amount  needed  by  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR).  Funding \nfor  road  maintenance  is  even  limited,  accounting  for  about  25%  of  the  amount \nrequested  by  DOR  and  less  than  0.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nInadequate road sector funding leads to deterioration of the road network and will \nnot meet the needs of the reviving economy. \n\n(v) \n\nRoad  accidents  have  risen  significantly  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  the  total \nnumber growing from 860 in 1995 to 5,553 in 2002. The fatality rate in 2002 was \n24 persons per 10,000 vehicles, higher than in many other Asian countries.7 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n4. \nThe  key  problem  in  Mongolia\u2019s  road  sector  is  underdevelopment  of  the  road  network, \neven taking into account the country\u2019s low population density. Road density (0.03 km per km2) \nand the share of paved roads (3.4%) in Mongolia are both close to the low end of the countries \nin  the  world.8  The  share  of  freight  transport  by  road  is  also  lowest  among  the  transition \neconomies of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.9 Moreover, many \npaved and gravel roads are deteriorating and a large proportion remains impassable during the \nrainy or winter seasons due to inadequate maintenance. \n \n5. \nThe  main  constraint  to  development  of  the  road  sector  is  inadequate  funding  (an \nassessment  of  the  road  sector  financial  management  is  in  Appendix  2).  A  World  Bank  study \nnotes that for capital investment and maintenance, Mongolia\u2019s road sector requires a minimum \nannual  funding  equivalent  to  2.4%  of  GDP  during  1999\u22122014.10  The  Road  Fund  has  failed  to \nreceive  adequate  revenues  needed  for  the  road  sector,  and  actual  road  sector  funding  during \n1999\u22122003  accounted  for  less  than  1%  of  GDP.  Allocation  for  road  maintenance  has  been \ninadequate, despite some improvement in recent years. The share of funds allocated for road \nmaintenance (less than 0.2% of GDP) in Mongolia is lower than in many other Asian countries.11 \nFiscal deficits of the Government (3.6% of GDP in 2003) and a high external debt (103.7% of \nGDP in 2003) are the primary factors limiting government funding for the road sector. Lack of an \nupdated sector strategy exacerbates the problem because the Government sometimes fails to \nallocate limited financial resources to priority projects on the basis of the country\u2019s development \nstrategy and sound technical and economic analyses. \n\n                                                 \n5  The mid value in the world was 45.8 vehicles per 1,000 persons.

Washington, DC. \n\n6  The Road Fund established in 1991 and administered by the Department of Roads provides funding for the road \n\n7  For example, the road accident fatality rate in the PRC for 2001 was 17 persons per 10,000 vehicles. \n8  The mid-range values of road density and the share of paved roads in the  world are 0.2 km per km2 and 45.5%, \n\n9  World Bank. 2000.

The  potential  of  private  financing  to  develop  road \ninfrastructure is also limited, because the large capital investment requirements for developing \nroad  infrastructure  are  generally  beyond  the  private  sector\u2019s  present  capacity  to  mobilize \nresources.  Hence,  there  is  justification  for  external  aid  sources  including  ADB  to  continue \nassistance to the road sector of Mongolia, including financial support for the Project. The Project \nwill develop the road infrastructure between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud and will \nhave important implications for the following aspects. \n \n7. \nAccess to World Markets. As a large landlocked country, Mongolia depends on its two \nneighbors\uf8e7the  PRC  and  Russia\uf8e7for  access  to  world  markets  and  economic  development.  \nThe PRC and Russia dominate Mongolia\u2019s external trade and are major sources of its foreign \ndirect  investment  (FDI).  In  particular,  the  PRC  is  Mongolia\u2019s  largest  source  of  FDI,  its  largest \nmarket  for  exports,  and  second  largest  country  (after  Russia)  for  its  imports.12  Mongolia  also \nuses  the  port  of  Tianjin13  in  the  PRC,  the  closest  seaport,  for  access  to  the  markets  of  the \nUnited  States  and  other  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  However,  the  lack  of  paved  roads \nleading  to  the  PRC  is  a  constraint.  The  majority  of  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade  is  carried  on  the \nexisting  north-south  railway  line,  which  connects  Suhbaatar  at  the  border  with  Russia  and \nZamyn-Uud at the border with the PRC. While the railway is suitable for carrying long haul and \nbulk cargoes, it is less flexible and responsive to the needs of private traders for smaller freight \nand  over  shorter  distances.14  Railway  transport  is  also  subject  to  the  problem  of  different \ngauges between Mongolia and the PRC. The Project will increase Mongolia\u2019s access to world \nmarkets through the establishment of an all-weather road to link the highways of the PRC and \nRussia,15 and induce competition between railway and roads. \n \n8. \nTransit  Traffic.  Given  its  geographic  location,  Mongolia  can  serve  as  a  corridor  for \ntransit  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  Russia.  The  north-south  road  corridor  from  Altanbulag  to \nZamyn-Uud  through  Ulaanbaatar,  will  connect  the  Chinese  road  leading  to  the  port  of  Tianjin \nand the Russian road leading to Europe via the cities of Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, and thus can \nbecome an important transit route between the two neighbors. Transit traffic via this corridor is \nprojected  to  grow  by  6\u22128%  per  annum  during  2009\u22122025,  from  25.1  million  to  90.5  million  in \nTKM  and  from  113.9  million  to  289.4  million  in  PKM.  By  providing  faster,  safer,  and  more \nreliable road transport, this corridor will not only increase the efficiency of transit traffic between \nthe PRC and Russia via Mongolia, but also become a sustainable source of foreign exchange \nearnings for Mongolia. The importance of this corridor as a transit gateway and part of the Asian \nhighway network is recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand  the  Pacific  (UNESCAP).  With  ADB  assistance,  the  Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section  was \n\n                                                 \n12 The PRC accounted for 41.5% of Mongolia\u2019s exports ($217.3 million) and 20.2% of its imports ($139.5 million) in \n\n2002, as well as 40.2% of its FDI ($45.4 million) in 2003. \n\n13 Ulaanbaatar  is  1,700  km  away  from  Tianjin,  and  about  6,000  km  from  the  ports  of  Vladivostok  and  Nakhodka  in \n\nRussia. \n\n14 For example, there is a shortage of rail wagons in Zamyn-Uud, so trucks that carry freight from the PRC often have \nto  wait  4  or  more  days  to  transship  the  freight  to  wagons  for  further  railway  transport  to  other  destinations  in \nMongolia.  Moreover,  the  railway  does  not  unload  cargo  at  intermediate  stops  between  Zamyn-Uud  and \nUlaanbaatar (e.g., Choyr and Saynshand), so traders have to either carry the goods in passenger compartments, \nor receive their cargo in Ulaanbaatar and then travel back to the ultimate destinations. \n\n15 With  the  construction  of  an  all-weather  road  between  Choyr  and  Zamyn-Uud,  the  transit  time  for  container \nmovements between Tianjin and Ulaanbaatar will be reduced from the current 7\u221222 days to 3 days because trucks \ndo not need to wait for wagons in Zamyn-Uud.  \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\nrehabilitated and the Nalayh-Choyr section is under construction.16 The Project will complete the \nremaining section of the corridor between Choyr and the border with the PRC. \n \n9. \nPoverty Reduction. Mongolia is a poor country: 35.6% of the population lives in poverty \n(1998) and per capita GDP is $505 (2003). The project feasibility study shows that about 10,500 \npeople (21.6% of the total population) in the project area are living in poverty. Poverty is largely \nincome-based  and  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  job  opportunities.  The  number  of  people \nunemployed in the project area was about 3,600 in 2002, with the unemployment rate at 18.4%. \nAs about 57% of the population are 25 years or younger and many young people enter the labor \nmarket each year, the unemployment and poverty situation in the project area is grave. The lack \nof  paved  roads  between  Choyr  and  Zamym-Uud  hinders  investors  from  doing  business  in  the \nproject  area  and  limits  local  communities\u2019  access  to  markets  and  social  services.  The  Project \nwill help tackle the poverty problem in the project area by improving the road infrastructure, so \nas to attract investments, create local jobs, and provide local communities with better access to \nmarkets and social services. \n \nRoad  Safety.  Road  safety  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  Mongolia.  Poor  road \n10. \nconditions  are  among  the  major  factors  conducive  to  the  increase  in  road  accidents,  together \nwith  poor  driving  skills,  high  vehicular  speeds,  intoxicated  driving,  and  technical  problems  of \nvehicles.  The  road  surface  is  deteriorating  and  some  sections  lack  road  safety  features  (e.g., \nmarkings, signage, and guardrails). The problem is exacerbated by weak enforcement of traffic \nsafety  regulations  due  to  the  limited  capacity  of  the  Traffic  Police  Department  (TPD),  as  most \ntraffic  police  officers  have  neither  appropriate  training  nor  adequate  monitoring  equipment.  \nWith  the  present  rate  of  increase  in  vehicle  ownership,  there  is  the  potential  for  more  road \naccidents. The Project will improve road safety by designing and constructing the project road \nand  access  roads  according  to  national  standards,  complemented  by  the  implementation  of  a \nroad safety improvement component. \n \nThe Government\u2019s road sector strategy aims to improve the efficiency of road transport \n11. \nto facilitate the country\u2019s economic and social development. The strategy focuses on (i) creating \na  favorable  environment  for  developing  a  competitive  road  transport  industry,  (ii)  increasing \ninvestment  on  road  construction  and  rehabilitation  to  reduce  Mongolia\u2019s  isolation  from  world \nmarkets and improve the accessibility of isolated communities within the country, (iii) increasing \nfunding for road maintenance, (iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, \nand (v) improving road safety. While progress has been made on creating a favorable climate \nfor a competitive road transport industry, severe fiscal constraints have limited the progress on \nincreasing  funding  for  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  improving  road  safety. \nMoreover,  the  strategy  should  review  the  need  to  maintain  the  existing  road  network  in  areas \nwith  low  population  densities.  A  Road  Master  Plan  prepared  with  ADB  assistance17  identified \npriority sections for investment and improvement, but the Master Plan needs updating as many \npriority  projects  identified  have  been  constructed  or  are  under  construction.  The  Government \nhas accorded high priority to the Project and the construction of the east-west millennium road \nthat links several aimag (province) centers with Ulaanbaatar. However, the millennium road has \nsignificant  implications  for  the  fiscal  stability  and  debt  sustainability  of  the  country,  and  is  a \nsubject of ongoing dialogue between external aid agencies and the Government. \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB.  1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nThe  main  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  strategy  for  Mongolia  is  to  foster  pro-poor \n12. \neconomic  growth  to  reduce  poverty.18  The  strategy  focuses  on  support  for  (i)  creating  an \nenvironment conducive to private sector-led growth, (ii) generating employment, (iii) maintaining \nstandards of human development, (iv) strengthening and reforming the social protection system, \nand  (v)  undertaking  governance  reforms.  The  latest  country  strategy  and  program  update  for \nMongolia19  indicates  that  roads  should  continue  to  be  among  the  strategic  focuses  of  ADB \noperations,  and  gives  priority  to  the  completion  of  the  north-south  road  corridor.  The  Project, \nwhich  is  included  in  the  assistance  program  for  2004,  is  supportive  of  the  objective  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and is consistent with its efforts for promoting regional cooperation, as it would \ncontribute to increasing traffic, trade, and investment among countries in the region. \n \n13.  Mongolia\u2019s road sector has received external assistance since 1991 (Appendix 3). ADB \nhas approved two loans totaling $50 million and five TA grants totaling $3.3 million for improving \nthe  north-south  road  corridor,  supporting  sector  reforms,  and  building  DOR\u2019s  capacity.  \nADB  assistance,  which  helped  advance  its  road  sector  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in \nMongolia, included (i) developing the Road Act and the Road Transport Act to lay the basis for a \nsector  policy  framework,  (ii)  formulating  the  Road  Master  Plan,  and  (iii)  establishing  the  Road \nBoard  to  monitor  operation  of  the  Road  Fund.  However,  the  recommendations  of  the  ADB-\nfinanced TA\uf8e7that the Road Fund be used primarily for maintenance and that most of the Road \nFund  revenues  come  from  road-user  charges  set  at  levels  reflecting  the  costs  that  vehicles \nimpose on the road system\uf8e7have not been fully implemented.20 \n \n14. \nADB  assistance  has  been  complemented  by  activities  of  other  external  aid  agencies. \nThe World Bank extended two credits totaling $64 million to upgrade part of the east-west road \ncorridor,  improve  road  safety  and  maintenance,  and  train  DOR  staff.  The  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  provided  grants  for  improving  roads  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  in  eastern \nMongolia.  The  Kuwait  Fund  is  assisting  in  improving  the  Darhan-Erdenet-Bulgan  road.  \nWith  support  from  the  Nordic  Development  Fund,  the  Government  is  formulating  a  road \nmaintenance  plan.  ADB  has  coordinated  closely  with  other  external  aid  agencies  in  the  road \nsector.  A  working  group  on  infrastructure,  cochaired  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  was \nestablished in April 2004 to coordinate external assistance activities. ADB and the World Bank \nagreed  to  harmonize  their  respective  positions  on  road  sector  issues  and  jointly  assist  the \nGovernment to develop a transport sector strategy that would assess total funding requirements \nto maintain the existing road network, identify major funding constraints, and recommend how to \naddress these constraints over the medium term. ADB also consults with UNESCAP regularly to \nmaintain collaboration in the road sector. \n \n15. \nLessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Mongolia\u2019s  road  sector  has  been \ngenerally  satisfactory.  Evaluation  of  the  country  assistance  program  conducted  in  200221 \nconcluded that ADB\u2019s road sector projects helped increase traffic counts and expand economic \nactivities  in  the  project  road-influenced  areas.  The  first  road  project  for  rehabilitating  the \nAltanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section  was  completed  in  2001  and  was  rated  as  highly  successful.22 \nWhile  implementation  of  the  second  road  project  for  developing  the  Nalayh-Choyr  section \nexperienced initial delays due to limited experience of the contractor and the executing agency, \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2000.

Project  Completion  Report  on  the  Roads  Development  Project  (Loan  1364-MON  [SF])  in  Mongolia. \n\nManila. \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\nthe pace of implementation has picked up and the Government and the contractor are working \non the target of completing the project at the end of 2004 as scheduled. Nevertheless, the road \nprojects supported by ADB and other external aid agencies in Mongolia and in the region have \nprovided  four  major  lessons,  which  have  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  this  Project.  \nFirst,  loan  projects  involve  risks  of  implementation  delays  because  of  (i)  limited  experience  of \nimplementing  agencies and  contractors;  (ii)  Mongolia\u2019s  extreme  winter  conditions  that  limit  the \nannual  construction  season  to  only  6  months  (April\u2212October),  which  means  that  even  minor \ndelays  in  contractors\u2019  mobilization  schedule  or  processing  of  project  documents  may  result  in \nslippage  of  1  year  in  project  implementation;  and  (iii)  the  complexity  of  resolving  cross-border \nissues.23 While DOR\u2019s project management capacity has improved through training, it would be \nfurther strengthened by consulting services under the Project. Special attention will also be paid \nduring the bidding process to ensure the recruitment of experienced civil works contractors. \n \n16. \nSecond, the Government\u2019s repeated difficulties in meeting funding requirements for road \nmaintenance  through  the  state  budget  highlights  the  need  to  establish  a  sustainable  funding \nmechanism.  Since  the  Road  Fund  by  itself  is  not  a  guarantee  that  sufficient  funds  will  be \nprovided  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  road  network,  the  Project  will  establish  a  facility  in  Zamyn-\nUud  to  collect  vehicle  fees,  with  fee  revenues  to  be  allocated  to  the  Road  Fund  for  road \nmaintenance. The fee revenues generated are estimated to be sufficient not only to cover the \nannual  maintenance  cost  of  the  project  road,  but  also  to  contribute  for  maintenance  of  other \npriority  roads  in  the  country.  Third,  adequate  attention  should  be  paid  to  road  safety  issues \nwhen  formulating  and  implementing  road  projects.  While  road  safety  features  will  be \nincorporated into the project design, the Project includes a road safety improvement component \n(para.  22).  Fourth,  the  impact  of  road  infrastructure  projects  on  the  local  community  and  on \npoverty  reduction  should  be  strengthened.  The  Project  includes  an  area  development \ncomponent  that  will  enhance  project  benefits  for  local  communities,  including  the  poor  (paras. \n23\u221227).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  regional  cooperation  and  sustainable  economic \n17. \ngrowth  in  Mongolia.  The  purpose  is  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  domestic  and \ninternational  transit  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  Russia  through  Mongolia\u2019s  north-south  road \ntransport  corridor.  The  project  area  covers  a  population  of  about  48,400  in  the  aimags  of \nDornogovi and Govisumber in Mongolia. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  consists  of  five  components:  (i)  construction  of  the  project  road,  \n18. \n(ii)  implementation  of  a  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan,  (iii)  road  safety \nimprovement, (iv) implementation of an area development  program, and (v) TA for awareness \nand prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the north-south road corridor. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 For example, it took more than 2 years before the Cross-Border Agreement between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, supported by ADB, was signed by the two governments and became effective.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n1. \n\nProject Road \n\n19. \nThe project road, about 428 km, extends from Choyr (the point where the ADB-assisted \nSecond Roads Development Project ends) to the border with the PRC in Zamyn-Uud. The route \nbetween Choyr and Saynshand will run parallel to the railway line on the eastern side, while the \nroute between Saynshand and Zamyn-Uud will lie on the western side of the railway line, with a \nrailway level crossing in Saynshand. The project road will be designed according to Mongolian \nhighway  design  standards.  The  Choyr-Zamyn-Uud  section  will  be  a  two-lane  paved  road  with \n7.0-meter (m)-wide pavement and  1.5 m shoulders. The section between Zamyn-Uud and the \nborder  with  the  PRC  will  be  a  four-lane  paved  road  with  14.0  m  wide  pavement  and  2.0  m \nshoulders. Civil works costs are estimated at $50.1 million equivalent. \n \nAs the project area is semiarid and sparsely vegetated steppe, vegetation will be planted \n20. \nalong the project road for a length of 15\u221218 km at intervals within an approximate distance of \n130 km to serve as windbreaks to control snow and sand drifts. About $1 million equivalent will \nbe allocated for vegetation planting. \n \n\n2. \n\nCross-Border Road Transport Facilitation Plan \n\n21. \nThe  plan  aims  to  promote  efficient  movement  of  vehicles  across  the  Mongolian-PRC \nborder  (Appendix  4).  The  plan  comprises  the  Government\u2019s  committed  actions,  within  the \nspecific  time  frame,  to  (i)  develop  a  transit  traffic  framework  agreement  with  the  PRC  and \nRussia, (ii) establish regulations on cross-border vehicles according to international standards, \n(iii)  negotiate  with  the  PRC  on  increased  access  of  Mongolian  vehicles  to  PRC  territory,  \n(iv) improve the road between Zamyn-Uud and the border with the PRC, (v) collect vehicle fees \nfor road maintenance, (vi) enforce vehicle weight control, and (vii) establish emergency services \nfor vehicles and passengers traveling on the north-south road corridor. The amount of $230,000 \nequivalent will be allocated for consulting services to assist in implementing the plan. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety Improvement \n\n22. \nThis  component  comprises  (i)  installation  of  road  safety  features  (i.e.,  centerline \nmarkings,  reflectors  on  the  shoulders,  road  signs,  safety  barriers,  and  telephone  lines  for \nreporting  emergencies  along  the  road)  on  the  Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section  ($350,000);  \n(ii) independent road safety audit of the detailed design of the Project ($15,000); (iii) distribution \nof  pamphlets  and  posters  on  road  safety  to  raise  public  awareness;  (iv)  procurement  of  two \npatrol  vehicles  equipped  with  breath  analyzers  and  speed  monitoring  equipment  and  11  two-\nway  communication  radios  ($63,200);  and  (v)  training  of  traffic  police  officers  on  traffic \nregulations and enforcement by an international specialist within 1 year before the project road \nis  opened  ($46,000).  The  component  will  complement  the  inclusion  of  safety  features  into  the \ndesign  of  the  project  road.  DOR  will  coordinate  with  TPD  on  training  the  traffic  police  officers, \nand  these  officers  will  then  deliver  road  safety  education  to  concerned  local  communities.  \nThe amount of $474,200 equivalent will be allocated for this component. \n \n\n4. \n\nArea Development \n\n23. \nThis component is designed to ensure that the benefits generated from the project road \nare  shared  adequately  with  local  communities,  including  the  poor.  The  component  comprises  \n(i) construction of access roads, (ii) establishment of roadside stations, (iii) local labors\u2019 training \non road construction and maintenance, and (iv) stakeholder participation. \n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\nAccess  Roads.  Four  access  roads  totaling  34  km  will  be  constructed  to  facilitate  the \n24. \nmovement  of  people  and  goods  between  towns  in  the  project  area  and  the  project  road.  \nThe four access roads comprise (i) a road from Erdene (10 km), (ii) a road from Orgon (20 km), \nand  (iii)  two  roads  from  Saynshand  (2  km  each).  The  roads  were  selected  with  stakeholder \nparticipation and consultation. The roads from Saynshand will be built to the same standards as \nthe  project  road,  while  the  road  from  Erdene  and  Orgon  will  be  single-lane  roads  with  double \nbituminous  surface  treatment  (DBST)  surface,  with  4  m  wide  pavement,  and  1  m  shoulders.  \nThe amount of $3.6 million equivalent will be allocated for constructing the access roads. \n \n25. \nRoadside  Stations.  Roadside  stations  serve  as  a  place  for  interaction  between  road \noperators/users and local communities, and offer an organized venue for local specialty shops, \nrestaurants,  rests,  emergency  services,  gas  stations,  and  centers  for  traffic  and  local \ninformation, thus stimulating local business, jobs, and revenues. Roadside stations also reduce \nthe  transport  costs  of  local  residents  to  distant  markets.  A  pilot  roadside  station  at  the \nintersection between the project road and the access road linking Erdene is proposed for grant \nfunding from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).24 Erdene was selected for its high \npoverty  incidence,  underdeveloped  status,  availability  of  resources,  and  reasonable  intervals \nbetween aimag centers.25 The pilot roadside station will be developed  with the participation of \nlocal  communities.  The  proposed  JFPR  grant  is  expected  to  finance  detailed  design  of  the \nroadside  station,  skills  training  for  small  enterprise  development  and  the  poor,  and  the \nestablishment  and  operation  of  a  community-based  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem. If the pilot roadside station is successful, the Government plans to replicate it in other \nroad sector projects. \n \nLocal  Laborers\u2019  Training  on  Road  Construction  and  Maintenance.  Training  for \n26. \nsemiskilled equipment operators and construction workers will be conducted in the project area \nwithin  12  months  after  loan  effectiveness  to  ensure  maximum  use  of  local  labor  during  road \nconstruction.  DOR  will  conduct  the  training  program,  while  the  governments  of  Dornogovi  and \nGovisumber  aimags  will  select  the  trainees,  preferably  unemployed  youths.  The  trainees  are \nexpected  to  be  hired  first  for  constructing  access  roads.  With  the  experience  gained,  they  will \nlikely be hired for constructing the project road. DOR will also train households living along the \nproject road on road maintenance 1 year before project completion. These households will then \nbe contracted by DOR to maintain short segments of the project road. The amount of $63,000 \nequivalent will be allocated for the training program. \n \n27. \nStakeholder  Participation.  Stakeholder  participation  began  during  project  preparation \nand  will  continue  during  implementation  to  enhance  the  local  community\u2019s  ownership  of  the \nProject. Stakeholder participation will focus on (i) support for maximum use of local labor during \nroad construction and for good working conditions, (ii) job creation through business advice and \nskills development, (iii) development of roadside stations, (iv) implementation of the road safety \nprogram, (iv) involvement of households in road maintenance, (v) awareness and prevention of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  and  (vi)  community-based  environmental  enhancement  and \nmonitoring. A local nongovernment organization (NGO) will be engaged to facilitate stakeholder \nparticipation. The amount of $128,800 equivalent will be allocated for the service. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 The  concept  paper  for  the  proposed  roadside  station  component  for  JFPR  funding  was  cleared  on  13  February \n\n2004, and the component is expected to be submitted to the Government of Japan by 15 December 2004.  \n\n25 About 35.2% of the 623 households in Erdene live in poverty. Erdene has a kidney treatment center. It produces \nlivestock  products  and  has  potential  for  developing  products  such  as  shoes  and  bags.  Many  poor  women  in  the \narea expressed interest in engaging in various income-generating activities such as garment making. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\n5. \n\nAwareness and Prevention of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n28.  While  Mongolia  is  at  the  early  stage  of  HIV/AIDS  epidemics  with  only  four  registered \ncases,26  the  country  is  vulnerable  to  diseases  due  to  high-risk  behavior  among  the  young \npopulation,  an  increasing  number  of  sex  workers  inexperienced  on  condom  use,  high \nprevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and rapidly growing HIV/AIDS diseases in \nthe neighboring countries. The construction of the project road and the operation of the north-\nsouth road transport corridor after project completion may increase the spread of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking  because  of  a  large  number  of  workers  during  construction  and  increased \nmovement  of  the  population  across  the  borders  with  the  PRC  and  Russia.  With  high  poverty \nincidence,  women  are  disproportionately  vulnerable \nfor \nprostitution.27  The  TA  will  help  mitigate  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  and  human \ntrafficking along the north-south road corridor. \n \nC. \n\nto  HIV/AIDS  and \n\nSpecial Features \n\ntrafficking \n\nRegional Cooperation. The Project will establish Mongolia\u2019s first paved road corridor to \n29. \nlink the Asian highway network of the PRC and Russia, and will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s transport \nlinks to its trading partners in the region. The project road will serve as an important corridor for \ntransit  traffic,  facilitating  trade  and  reducing  transaction  costs  in  the  region.  The  Republic  of \nKorea and the PRC will provide concessional or grant resources to cofinance the construction of \nthe  project  road,  while  Japan  through  JFPR  is  expected  to  provide  financial  support  for \nestablishing the pilot roadside station. Implementing the cross-border road transport facilitation \nplan  will  foster  the  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  passengers  between  Mongolia  and  the \nPRC. The Project is thus an example of ADB\u2019s efforts in promoting regional cooperation. \n \n30. \nPolicy  Dialogue.  ADB  has  continued  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  road \nsector financing (including the millennium road) and maintenance during the preparation of the \nProject.  Important  progress  has  been  made  in  this  regard.  Following  a  substantial  increase  in \nroad  maintenance  funding  from  the  Road  Fund  to  MNT5.0  billion  ($4.2  million)  in  2004,28  the \nGovernment  agreed  to  continue  to  increase  road  maintenance  funding  by  8%  per  annum  to \nMNT7.5  billion  in  2009  to  fully  meet  the  funding  requirement.  Moreover,  the  Project  includes \nestablishing a facility in Zamyn-Uud to collect vehicle fees beginning in 2009, with fee revenues \nto  be  allocated  to  the  Road  Fund  for  road  maintenance.29  Based  on  projected  traffic,  the \nestimated fee revenues would amount to about $2.0 million in 2009 and would increase to $3.6 \nmillion  in  2025  (Appendix  5).30  This  amount  will  not  only  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  estimated \nannual  maintenance  cost  of  $1.9  million  for  the  project  road,  but  also  contribute  to  funding  to \nmaintain other priority roads in the country. The Government has agreed to engage the private \nsector for the fee collection services. These measures will complement the development of the \nGovernment\u2019s new transport sector strategy to address road sector financing and maintenance \nissues over the medium term. \n \n31. \nImpact  on  Local  Communities.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  to  maximize  the \npoverty  reduction  impact  on  local  communities  through  the  area  development  component.  \n                                                 \n26 The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS estimates that about 300 persons might have been infected  with \n\nHIV in Mongolia by the end of 2003. \n\n27 An attempted trafficking of over 400 Mongolian girls was reported in the UB Post on 30 January 2004. \n28 This increased road maintenance funding by more than 170% compared with 2003. \n29 Fees will be collected amounting to $1 for small and medium cars, $1.5 for jeeps, $2 for small trucks and buses, $5 \n\nfor medium trucks and buses, $10 for large buses, and $20 for trucks with trailers. \n\n30 The  amount  of  fee  revenues  to  be  collected  from  vehicles  from  the  PRC  and  Russia  during  2009\u22122025  is \n\nestimated at $6.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  construction  of  local  roads  will  improve  the  access  of  local  residents  to  markets,  job \nopportunities,  and  social  services.  The  establishment  of  the  pilot  roadside  station  will  expand \nlocal business and create jobs for local people. Training on road construction and maintenance \nwill  improve  the  skills  of  local  laborers,  including  the  poor,  so  that  they  could  be  hired  during \nproject  implementation.  The  stakeholder  participatory  process  will  encourage  involvement  of \nlocal  communities  in  project  design  and  implementation.  With  these  activities,  the  Project  will \ncontribute to economic growth and poverty reduction in the project area. \n \nAwareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The  Project \n32. \nincludes the TA to address the risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking, which may \nbe  associated  with  a  large  number  of  construction  workers  and  the  increased  cross-border \nmovement of the population along the north-south road corridor after project completion. This is \nthe  first  externally  financed  project  in  Mongolia  that  will  help  develop  road  infrastructure  and \naddress  the  issues  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  concurrently.  This  combination  will \nstrengthen the positive social impacts of the Project. \n \nStakeholder Participation and Consultation. During project preparation, consultations \n33. \nwere held with the Government, civil society, local communities, and other external aid agencies \non major issues such as project alternatives, route alignment, social and environmental impacts, \nand  project  benefits  for  local  communities  (Appendix  6).  The  consultations  revealed  a  high \ndegree of public support for the Project. Stakeholder participation and consultation will continue \nduring project implementation under the area development component.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n34. \nThe  total  project  cost is  estimated  at  $78.1  million  equivalent,  comprising  $52.8  million \n(67.6%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $25.3  million  equivalent  (32.4%)  in  local  currency.  The  cost \nestimates are summarized are in Table 1 and detailed costs estimates are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n1.

The proposed loan will finance $31.6 million (59.8%) of the foreign exchange cost \nand $5.5 million equivalent (21.7%) of the local currency cost, or 47.5% of the total project cost. \nThe  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  PRC  will  cofinance  the  Project  on  a  parallel  basis.  \nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  will  extend  a  loan  of  $23.9  million  equivalent  on \nconcessional terms to finance 30.6% of the total project cost for civil works for part of the Choyr-\nSaynshand  section.  The  PRC  Government  will  provide  a  grant  of  $1.5  million  equivalent  to \nfinance 1.9% of the total project cost for civil works for upgrading the section between Zamyn-\nUud  and  the  border  with  the  PRC.  The  Mongolian  Government  will  finance  20%  of  the  total \nproject cost (i.e., $15.6 million equivalent) including local taxes and duties. \n \n36. \nThe proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter. The loan from the Republic of Korea will have a maturity of 30 years including \na  grace  period  of  10  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  2%  per  annum.  The  Borrower  will  be \nMongolia. A proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan ($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nAsian Development Bank \nRepublic of Korea Government \nPRC Government  \nMongolian Governmenta \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \na  Financing from the Government of Mongolia includes local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n31.6\n18.0\n1.2\n2.0\n52.8\n\nTotal \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n5.5\n5.9\n0.3\n13.6\n25.3\n\nTotal Cost \n\nPercent of \nProject Cost\n47.5\n30.6\n1.9\n20.0\n100.0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n37.1 \n23.9 \n1.5 \n15.6 \n78.1 \n\nDOR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  to  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation.  \n37. \nTo ensure close interagency coordination and effective implementation, DOR will be assisted by \na project steering committee (PSC) and a project implementation unit (PIU). The PSC will be set \nup  at  the  central  level  to  supervise  project  implementation.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  state \nsecretary of finance and economy and will comprise representatives of the ministries of finance \nand  economy,  foreign  affairs,  health,  infrastructure,  justice  and  home  affairs,  nature  and \nenvironment, DOR, and governments of Dornogovi and Govisumber aimags. The PSC will meet \nat least once every 6 months to review the progress of implementation and provide guidance, as \nnecessary. ADB will attend the PSC meetings as observer. \n \n38. \nA  PIU  will  be  established  within  DOR  to  implement  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  \nThe  deputy  director  of  DOR  will  be  appointed  project  director  to  head  the  PIU.  The  project \ndirector  will  be  assisted  by  two  full-time  project  managers:  one  to  implement  the  road  section \nfunded by the loan from the Republic of Korea and the other to implement the remaining project \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\ncomponents.  The  project  director  and  the  project  managers  will  be  assisted  by  a  team31  of \nqualified technical, financial, and administrative staff in the PIU. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  5  years,  from  August  2004  to  July  2009.  \n\n39. \nA proposed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nthrough \n\ninternational  competitive  bidding,  or  according \n\n40. \nGoods  and  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia. \nCivil  works  for  the  project  road  (including  the  two  access  roads  to  Saynshand  and  vegetation \nplanting)  and  the  access  road  from  Orgon  are  divided  into  four  contract  packages  to  be \nprocured \nto  relevant  bilateral \nagreements.  Because  the  civil  works  contracts  will  cost  less  than  $1  million  and  domestic \ncontractors are capable of undertaking such works, civil works for the access road from Erdene \nand the provision of safety features on the Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar road section will be procured \nfollowing local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Patrol vehicles equipped with \nbreath  analyzers  and  portable  speed  monitoring  equipment,  two-way  communication  radios, \nand a vehicle weight mat will be procured following direct purchase or local competitive bidding \nprocedures. The proposed contract packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n41. \nThe  Government  was  informed  that  ADB  encourages  joint  ventures  through  the \ndomestic  preference  margin  for  supply  contracts,  and  requires  the  borrower  (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-funded contracts to \nobserve the highest standard of ethics in procuring and executing such contracts. \n \nAdvance procurement action for civil works has been approved. Advance action will be \n42. \nundertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  up  to,  but  will  not  include,  the \nsigning of contracts. It will cover (i) short-listing and selecting a consulting firm for construction \nsupervision, \ntendering  and  bid  evaluation.  \nThe Government was advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n\n(ii)  prequalifying  contractors,  and \n\n(iii) \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n43. \nThe Project will provide 1,158 person-months of consulting services (177.5 international \nand  980.5  domestic)  to  assist  in  implementation.  Of  that  number,  161  (international)  and  884 \n(domestic) person-months will be required for detailed design, construction supervision, support \nfor project management, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The services will be provided \nby  consulting  firms  with  experience  in  detailed  design  and  implementation  of  road  projects  of \nsimilar nature and size. The supervision team will be mobilized on the date the contractor begin \nthe  works.  During  the  defect  liability  period,  the  resident  engineer  will  continue  on  a  part-time \nbasis  while  the  supervision  team  members  will  be  mobilized  on  an  as-required  intermittent \nbasis. \n \n44. \nConsulting  services  of  4  (international)  and  80  (domestic)  person-months  will  be \nprovided  through  a  local  NGO  to  help  implement  the  area  development  component.  \n\n                                                 \n31 Comprising four highway engineers, an accountant, and two administrative assistants.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\nThe  services  required  cover  (i)  continued  stakeholder  participation  process,  (ii)  monitoring  of \nsocial safeguards, (iii) training for small enterprise and skills development, and (iv) support for \nvulnerable groups. For the road safety improvement component, an international consultant and \na  domestic  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  2  person-weeks  each  to  jointly  audit  road  safety \naspects of the detailed design of the Project. An international consultant will also be engaged for \n2 person-months to train traffic police officers on traffic regulations and enforcement. Further, an \ninternational consulting firm will provide 10 (international) and 16 (domestic) person-months of \nconsulting  services  to  assist  in  implementing  the  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation  plan. \nThe Government will finance consulting services for detailed design, while ADB will finance the \nremaining  consulting  services.  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \nand engaging domestic consultants. \n \n45. \nFacilities  (e.g.,  office  space,  vehicles,  communication,  and  staff  housing)  for  the \nconstruction supervision consultants will be provided under the civil works contracts. DOR will \nprovide administrative and logistical support to the consultants in the discharge of their duties. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46. \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001).  Since  most  payments  will  be  made  for  contracts  well  above \n$100,000,  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  the  loan  funds.  If  government \nfunds are first used for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement procedures will be applied. \nTo  expedite  loan  disbursement,  the  Government  will  open  after  loan  effectiveness  an  imprest \naccount at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial deposit of $500,000 equivalent. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenses  and  liquidating  advances  from  the \nimprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE \nprocedure will not exceed $100,000 equivalent. \n \n47. \nTo  ensure  smooth  project  implementation,  the  proposed  ADB  loan,  the  loan  from  the \nRepublic of Korea, the PRC grant, and counterpart funding from the Mongolian Government are \nrequired to be disbursed according to the implementation schedule in Appendix 8. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nfinancial  statements  audited  annually  by \n\n48. \nDOR  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  prepare  financial  statements  for  the \nProject according to international accounting standards. DOR will have the project accounts and \nrelated \nindependent  auditors  with  adequate \nqualification  and  experience  in  international  accounting  and  auditing  and  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe  audit  report  covering  the  audited  project  account  and  financial  statements  for  each  fiscal \nyear, together with a management letter, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of \neach  fiscal  year.  The  Government  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  of  timely  submission  of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nproposed ADB loan in case of noncompliance with the requirement. An independent road safety \naudit of the detailed design of the project road and access roads will be conducted before civil \nworks start. \n \n49. \nDOR will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports on progress made and problems \nencountered  during  the  period  under  review,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nproblems,  and  proposed  activities  and  expected  progress  during  the  following  period.  Within  \n3 months of the completion of the Project, DOR will submit a project completion report to ADB to \nfacilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project.  The  project  completion  report  will  provide  details  of \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50. \nThe  Mission  and  the  Government  have  jointly  prepared  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system (PPMS) (Appendix 10). The baseline values for project impact indicators will \nbe  established  before  project  implementation.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  measured  with  the \nnecessary  frequency  during  project  implementation.  Findings  will  be  incorporated  in  quarterly \nreports  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project \nevaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where relevant, \nindicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  sex.  Participatory  surveys  will  be  conducted  and  results \ncompared with the baseline values. The construction supervision consultant will assist DOR in \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project.  \nAt inception, project completion, and 3 years after completion, DOR will submit to ADB a report \nthat summarizes the key findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the  \n3 preceding years. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nADB will conduct regular (at least once a year) reviews of the Project\u2018s progress. If the \nreviews  show  serious  implementation  problems,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on \nappropriate mitigating measures to ensure achievement of the project objectives. In the second \nyear  of  construction  of  the  project  road,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  midterm \nreview of the Project to assess (i) implementation status; (ii) design and construction standards; \n(iii) performance of consultants and contractors; (iv) project impacts, particularly those relating \nto  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and \npoverty  reduction;  (v)  progress  on  road  sector  reforms;  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the \ncovenants stipulated in the loan agreement; and (vii) the need for additional works or changes in \nproject  scope.  With  assistance  from  DOR,  ADB  will  make  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the \nsocioeconomic impacts of the Project by comparing indicators collected at the midterm review \nwith the baseline data. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n52. \nThe Mission emphasized ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy to the Government and executing \nagency, highlighting the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe Mission also assessed financial management and procurement capacity in Mongolia. DOR \nhas adopted accounting and auditing procedures according to the Law on Accounting (approved \nin  2002)  and  the  State  Audit  Law  (approved  in  2003),  which  are  based  on  international \naccounting  and  auditing  standards.  Mongolia\u2019s  performance  in  submitting  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  for  ADB-assisted  projects  has  been  generally  satisfactory, \nalthough there was one case of noncompliance each year during 2001\u22122003. The risks of theft \nor misappropriation of ADB funds are comparatively low in Mongolia, but the country needs to \ncontinue  anticorruption  efforts.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  follow  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption \npolicy during project implementation. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n53. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide under the Project TA for awareness and \nprevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking on the north-south road corridor. The goal of the \nTA  is  to  reduce  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  that  may  be  associated  with  the \nconstruction  of  the  project  road  and  operation  of  the  north-south  road  transport  corridor  after \nproject completion. The purposes of the TA are to (i) raise public awareness of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking;  (ii)  address  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  among  construction  workers, \nsex workers, local communities, truck drivers, and other road users; and (iii) strengthen border \ncontrol capacity against human trafficking. Consultants with expertise in anti-human trafficking, \nhealth  education  and  advocacy,  HIV/AIDS  medical  services,  and  epidemiological  surveillance \nand monitoring will provide 1.5 (international) and 160 (domestic) person-months of consulting \nservices.  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. Equipment, supplies, and materials will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are in Appendix 11. \n \n54. \nThe  TA  cost  is  estimated  at  $420,000  equivalent,  comprising  $115,000  in  foreign \nexchange  and  $305,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  A  grant  of  $350,000  equivalent  from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program is proposed to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $235,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost by providing counterpart staff, office space, and workshop facilities.  \n \n55. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  implement  the  TA  in \ncoordination  with  DOR.  The  PIU  of  the  ADB-assisted  Second  Health  Sector  Development \nProject32  (Loan  1998)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  full-time  TA  coordinator  will  be \nappointed  and  two  small  offices  with  part-time  assistants  will  be  set  up  at  the  health \ndepartments  of  Dornogovi  and  Govisumber  aimags  in  Saynshand  and  Choyr,  respectively.  \nA  steering  committee  will  be  established  at  the  national  level  to  guide  TA  implementation.  \nThe  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  health  and  comprise \nrepresentatives of the PIU of the Second Health Sector Development Project, DOR, ministries \nof  health  and  justice  and  home  affairs,  the  General  Customs  Office,  and  a  technical  expert \ngroup. Advisory groups will also be set up at local levels, chaired by the governors\u2019 offices, with \nrepresentatives of aimag health and road departments; local transport operators; police, border, \nand customs officers; local communities; and relevant NGOs. The TA will be implemented over \n4.5 years, from February 2005 to July 2009. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  people  living  along  the  road  corridor  in  Mongolia  (about \n48,400  based  on  the  2003  population),  road  transport  operators  and  users,  construction \ncompanies,  traders,  and  other  people  who  derive  income  from  expanded  traffic,  trade,  and \ninvestment  in  the  region.  The  major  benefits  would  accrue  in  the  form  of  improved  trade  and \ntransit, and the significant reduction in transaction costs among the PRC, Mongolia, Russia, and \nother  trading  partners.  Major  direct  benefits  will  be  lower  transport  costs,  faster  and  more \nreliable  road  transport  services,  and  job  and  income  opportunities  created  during  project \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\nimplementation  (i.e.,  use  of  local  labor  and  construction  materials)  or  after  project  completion. \nThe Project is expected to create about 1,800 jobs on road construction for Mongolians, which \nwill generate income amounting to MNT3.4 billion ($2.9 million). Moreover, 210 households are \nexpected to be hired to maintain the project road, which will provide an average supplemental \nincome  of  MNT55,000  ($48)  per  family  per  year.  Improved  access  to  markets  and  reduced \ntransport costs will also help reduce prices and improve the quality and availability of food and \nother traded goods. Indirect benefits will be increased business and job opportunities that have \nbackward or forward linkages to the Project in Mongolia, the PRC, and Russia.  \n \n57. \nDistribution  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  will  result  in  net  benefits  of  $268.3  million, \ncomprising $235.7 million for Mongolia, $29.4 million for the PRC, and $3.2 million for Russia. \nMongolia will account for 87.8% of the total benefits, while the PRC and Russia are expected to \nreceive  11%  and  1.2%  of  the  total  benefits,  respectively.  Within  Mongolia,  passengers  and \nfreight shippers are the major beneficiaries, accounting for 57.8% and 26.3% of total benefits. \nThe Government\u2019s share is 15.9%. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  analysis33  of  the  Project  compared  the  with-  and  without-project  cases \n58. \n(Appendix  12).  The  analysis  is  based  on  2003  economic  prices  and  covers  20  years \n(2006\u22122025) comprising 3 years of construction and 17 years of operation. \n \n59. \nTraffic  forecasts  for  2006\u22122025  were  made  based  on  an  analysis  of  macro  level \ndemographic and economic trends for Mongolia as well as for the corridor between Choyr and \nthe PRC border in Zamyn-Uud, and traffic surveys conducted along the project road. Mongolia\u2019s \nGDP  is  projected  to  grow  by  4.5%  per  annum  and  its  population  to  increase  by  0.95%  per \nannum during 2006\u22122025; these figures are largely in line with recent growth rates. Based on \neconomic and demographic growth projections, aggregate traffic for the corridor between Choyr \nand  the  PRC  border  in  Zamyn-Uud  is  forecast  to  grow  by  6.3%  for  freight  traffic  in  TKM  and \n5.1%  for  passenger  traffic  in  PKM  during  2006\u22122025.  Traffic  growth  rates  are  higher  than  the \nrate  for  GDP  because  transport  intensity  of  the  economy  has  increased  in  recent  years,  with \nfreight transport intensity growing at a faster rate than passenger transport intensity. \n \n60. \nTransport  between  Choyr  and  Zamyn-Uud  is  by  road  and  rail.  Based  on  the  existing \nmodal  shares  and  an  analysis  of  traffic  patterns  on  modal  preference  derived  from  traffic \nsurveys, the projected corridor traffic was disaggregated into road and rail modes. The railway is \nprojected to remain the dominant mode of transport, although its shares in TKM and PKM are \nexpected to decrease gradually. The road will attract traffic, particularly from 2009 mainly due to \ndiverted traffic from railways. The share of the road is projected to increase from 0.4% to 5.8% \nin TKM and from 3.7% to 23.8% in PKM during 2006\u20132025. \n \n61. \nOn  the  basis  of  projected  corridor  traffic,  traffic  count  surveys  along  the  project  road \nalignment  during  August\u2212September  2003,  and  data  from  DOR,  traffic  forecasts  for  with-  and \nwithout-project  cases  were  made.  In  the  without-project  case,  traffic  would  continue  to  move \nalong  the  existing  multiple  unimproved  earth  tracks  (normal  traffic).  The  average  daily  traffic \n(ADT) will remain relatively low, from 288 vehicles in 2006 to 864 vehicles in 2025. In the with- \nproject case, ADT will increase significantly from 2009, the first year of operation of the project \n\n                                                 \n33 The  economic  analysis  covers  Mongolia  only  and  does  not  take  into  account  the  project  benefits  accruing  to  the \n\nPRC and Russia. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nroad, since the road is forecast to carry diverted and generated traffic. ADT is projected to grow \nfrom  288  vehicles  in  2006  to  3,075  vehicles  in  2025.  Regional  traffic  (i.e.,  traffic  from  or  to \nMongolia  and  transit  traffic  via  Mongolia)  is  projected  to  constitute  the  majority  of  total  traffic, \nwith its share growing from about 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n \n62. \nThere  are  four  ways  of  meeting  the  projected  road  traffic  between  Choyr  and  Zamyn-\nUud: (i) construction of an asphalt concrete road; (ii) construction of a road with DBST surface; \n(iii)  construction  of  a  gravel  road;  and  (iv)  expansion  of  the  capacity  of  the  existing  railway \ninstead of constructing the project road, given that the preliminary alignment for the project road \nroughly parallels the railway line. An alternatives analysis shows that the railway alternative has \nthe  lowest  value  in  terms  of  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  (19.7%)  and  net  present \nvalue (NPV, $59.1 million), and is thus less economically feasible. The gravel road option has \nthe second lowest value, with an EIRR of 26.4% and NPV of $68.2 million. The EIRR is highest \nfor the DBST road option (30.4%) and the second highest for the asphalt concrete road option \n(29.7%).  In  terms  of  NPV,  the  asphalt  concrete  road  option  ($131.3  million)  shows  a  higher \nvalue than the DBST road option ($121.9 million). In view of NPV and given that the project road \nforms  part  of  the  Asian  highway  network  and  other  sections  of  the  north-south  road  corridor \nbetween Altanbulag and Choyr are asphalt concrete, the asphalt concrete road option appears \na  better  choice  than  the  DBST  option.  The  alternatives  analysis  indicated  that  an  asphalt \nconcrete road between Choyr and the PRC border  in Zamyn-Uud is the economically efficient \noption for increasing transport capacity on this corridor.  \n \n63. \nThe Project\u2019s primary benefit is transport cost savings due to the improved road surface \nroughness34 and resultant increases in vehicle speeds. Transport cost savings are estimated to \naccount  for  96%  of  the  total  project  benefits.  The  Project  is  expected  to  result  in  an  average \nvehicle operating cost reduction of 43.1% per unit traveling between Choyr and the PRC border \nin Zamyn-Uud, ranging between 36.1% per car and 45.5% per heavy bus. The Project will also \nsave  travel time  because  of  the  relatively  straight  alignment  of  the  project  road  and  increased \naverage vehicle speeds. The Project is expected to reduce average travel time between Choyr \nand the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud by 56%, from 13.4 hours to 5.9 hours per trip. The Project \nwill contribute to reducing road accidents, but such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not \nincluded  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  Project  is  not  designed  to  alleviate  traffic  congestion \nsince  congestion  is  generally  not  a  concern  in  the  road  sector  of  Mongolia,  except  for \nUlaanbaatar during the rush hours on workdays. \n \n64. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR of the Project exceeds the cutoff level of 12%, \nexcept  when  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  capital  costs  increase  by  214%,  (ii)  road  maintenance  costs \nincrease  by  1,139%,  (iii)  the  surface  roughness  of  the  project  road  during  the  dry  season \nincreases by 175%, and (iv) traffic growth or user benefits are reduced by 66%. However, such \nsignificant changes in those variables are unlikely to occur. \n \n65. \nRisk analysis examined the probability distribution of the estimated EIRR and NPV of the \nProject. Within the assumed range of parameter estimates, the probability that the EIRR of the \nProject is less than 12% or NPV is negative 26%. The median EIRR is 14.7% with a range of \n0.5%\u221231.5%,  and  the  medium  NPV  amounts  to  $22.7  million  with  a  range  of  negative  $110.9 \nmillion\u2013$152.2 million. \n \n\n                                                 \n34 The Project  will significantly improve the road surface roughness between Choyr and the border  with the PRC in \n\nZamyn-Uud, with reduction in its international roughness index value from the present 20\u221222 to 2\u22123. \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nImpact on Poverty Reduction  \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Mongolia  by  creating  jobs  and \n66. \npromoting  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  social  and  poverty  analysis  undertaken  during \nproject preparation shows that about 10,500 poor (or 21.6% of total project beneficiaries) in the \nproject  area  will  benefit.  The  major  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project  will  include  \n(i)  creating  jobs  and  income  for  the  poor  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  the \nestablishment of the pilot roadside station; (ii) building local roads to increase the access of poor \ncommunities  to  markets  and  social  services;  (iii)  developing  job  skills  of  the  poor  through \ntraining; (iv) lowering prices of food and other daily necessities in local markets due to reduced \ntransport costs and travel time; (v) improving water supply from wells constructed during project \nimplementation; (vi) improving road safety; and (vii) addressing potential risks of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking.  For  the  poor,  the  Project  is  expected  to  create  about  770  jobs  in  road \nconstruction,  comprising  130  for  skilled  and  semiskilled  labor  and  640  for  unskilled  labor. \nMoreover, about 70 poor households will likely be hired to maintain the project road after project \ncompletion.  By  the  current  wage  level  in  Mongolia,  these  jobs  are  expected  to  earn  a  total \nannual  salary  of  $1.2  million  and  help  lift  1,574  poor  households  (about  6,300  people)  out  of \npoverty.  The  Project  will  thus  move  Mongolia  toward  achieving  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals.35 A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Gender Impacts \n\nLand acquired for the Project and temporary use of land for construction will not involve \n67. \nany  removal  of  structures  or  affect  private  landowners.  The  land  acquired  for  the  project  road \nand access roads is state-owned, and is either wasteland or communal grazing land. The area \nof grazing land lost is insignificant compared with the total area required for grazing. There are \nadequate  government  regulations  and  procedures  for  transferring  the  right-of-way  to  DOR.  \nThe Project requires no resettlement. \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  the  livelihoods  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  who \ninclude Kazakh, Durvud, and Bayad and account for 3.5% of the population in the project area. \nThese  groups  do  not  face  discrimination  and  are  not  considered  vulnerable.  The  Project  will \nhave no significant adverse impacts on the livelihoods of nomadic herders in the project area. \nInstead, it can help spur the development of the local livestock industry with improved access to \nmarkets and growing domestic and regional demands for livestock products. \n \n69. \nThe vulnerable groups in the project area are the poor, women (especially single female \nheads  of  households,  or  those  with  disabled  family  members),  the  disabled  or  chronically  ill, \norphans, the elderly, and unemployed youths. The major constraint for these groups is the lack \nof  job  opportunities  and  skills.  The  Project  will  provide  equal  job  opportunities  for  women  and \nother vulnerable groups, help develop their skills, and address their needs by engaging them in \nproject  design  and  implementation.  Measures  to  promote  women's  participation  and  mitigate \npotentially  negative  impacts  on  women  are  integrated  into  the  project  components  and \nassurances. \n \n\n                                                 \n35 ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for Mongolia (2004\u22122006) (footnote 19) states: \u201cTo help the country \nachieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  ADB  needs  to  continue  to  help  promote  economic  growth  for  job \ncreation and improve provision of essential social services for the poor.\u201d  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\nThe  Project  will  also  have  positive  social  impacts  with  the  implementation  of  specific \n70. \ncomponents  or  measures  to  address  issues  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  adequate \nworking conditions, and road safety. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\n71. \nADB  classifies  the  Project  in  environmental  category  \u201cB  sensitive\u201d.  The  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  was  undertaken  through  broad-based  public  consultations,  and  the \nsummary was circulated to the Board and made public on the ADB web site on 5 March 2004. \nThe EIA approved by the Ministry of Nature and Environment on 12 May 2004 concludes that \nthe Project will have no major adverse impacts on the environment. The project road alignment, \nwhich follows the railway line and crosses steppe and semidesert areas, does not impinge on \nany  existing  or  planned  protected  areas  and  is  not  expected  to  affect  wildlife  migration. \nOperation of a paved road will improve the environment as it provides an alternative to currently \ndriving  through  multiple  unimproved  earth  tracks,  which  has  contributed  to  land  degradation. \nPlanting  of  vegetation  at  specific  locations  along  the  project  road  will  help  improve  the \nenvironment by controlling snow and sand drifts. The Government will implement the mitigating \nmeasures proposed in the EIA during project implementation. \n \nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\n72. \nThe  Project  has  three  potential  risks.  First,  there  might  be  implementation  delays \nbecause  of  DOR\u2019s  limited  experience  in  managing  the  construction  of  a  relatively  long  road. \nThis  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  consulting  services  to  assist  in  project  management  and \nimplementation,  and  advance  action  on  procurement.  Second,  counterpart  funds  may  not  be \nprovided on a timely basis. ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure that sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  for  the  Project  are  allocated  in  a  timely  manner.  Third,  maintenance  of  the \nproject  road  after  completion  may  be  inadequate  due  to  insufficient  funding.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  mainly  through  the  establishment  of  the  facility  in  Zamyn-Uud  to  collect vehicle  fees \nbeginning in 2009, with fee revenues allocated to the Road Fund for maintenance of the project \nroad. The fee revenues will be sufficient to cover the estimated annual maintenance cost of the \nproject road to ensure sustainability. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nProject Funding. The Government will ensure that all counterpart funds required for the \n\n73. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n74. \nProject are provided on a timely basis. \n \n75. \nProject Monitoring and Evaluation. DOR will ensure that (i) baseline values for project \nimpact indicators are established before project implementation; (ii) findings on these indicators \nduring  project  implementation  are  incorporated  in  quarterly  reports  submitted  to  ADB;  and  \n(iii)  project  impacts  are  monitored  and  evaluated  through  surveys  at  project  completion  and  \n3 years after completion, and findings are reported to ADB. \n \n76. \nRoad Maintenance. The Government will ensure that (i) road maintenance funding from \nthe Road Fund is increased by at least 8% per annum from MNT5.0 billion in 2004 to MNT7.5 \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\nbillion in 2009; (ii) a facility is established in Zamyn-Uud to collect vehicle fees beginning in 2009 \nwith  fee  revenues  to  be  allocated  to  the  Road  Fund,  first  for  maintaining  the  project  road  and \nthen  for  other  priority  roads  in  the  country;  and  (iii)  DOR  engages  a  private  firm  for  managing \nthe operation of the fee collection facility. DOR will ensure that road maintenance units are set \nup  in  Ayrag,  Choyr,  Erdene,  and  Zamyn-Uud,  and  the  state-owned  maintenance  company  in \nSaynshand  is  provided  with  additional  staff  and  equipment  before  the  project  road  opens.  \nThe  Government  will  have  actual  expenses  on  road  maintenance  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors according to international auditing standards, and will furnish ADB with an \naudit report to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n77. \nCross-Border Road Transport Facilitation Plan. The Government will ensure that (i) it \napproves the cross-border road transport facilitation plan (Appendix 4) by 30 September 2004, \nand (ii) all actions in the plan are undertaken according to the schedule. \n \n78. \nVehicle Weight Control. The Government will ensure that vehicle axle weight limits are \nestablished  and  enforced  to  prevent  overloaded  vehicles  from  entering  the  project  road \nbeginning in 2006. \n \n79. \nRoad  Safety.  DOR  will  ensure  that  (i)  detailed  project  design  includes  road  safety \nfeatures,  and  (ii)  independent  road  safety  audit  of  the  detailed  design  of  the  project  road  is \nconducted  before  civil  works  begin.  DOR  will  notify  TPD  12  months  and  6  months  before  the \ncompletion of the project road, so that TPD can plan a traffic safety awareness and enforcement \ncampaign. DOR will procure patrol vehicles and communication equipment in coordination with \nTPD,  and  TPD  will  ensure  proper  maintenance  of  patrol  vehicles  and  the  communication \nequipment. \n \n80. \nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is  implemented  and \nproject  facilities  are  operated  and  maintained  according  to  existing  laws  and  government \nregulations  and  standards  concerning  environmental  protection,  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines; (ii) the guidelines developed under the EIA and the summary EIA are incorporated \ninto  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  environmental  mitigating \nmeasures  and  monitoring  requirements  identified  in  the  EIA  and  the  summary  EIA  are  fully \nimplemented during project implementation; and (iv) all necessary environmental approvals and \nclearances,  as  required  under  relevant  laws  and  government  regulations,  are  obtained  in  a \ntimely manner. \n \nResettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  entail  any  land \n81. \nacquisition and resettlement. In the event of any unforeseen resettlement, the Government will \ninform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement. Construction of civil \nworks will not start until ADB has reviewed and approved the resettlement plan. \n \n82. \nIndigenous  People.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  have  any \nadverse  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  nomadic  herders  and  ethnic  minority  groups  living  in  the \nproject area.  \n \n83. \nHealth Risks and Human Trafficking. The Government will ensure that (i) contractors \ndisseminate  information  on  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS/STIs  and  human  trafficking  to  workers \nemployed  during  project  implementation;  (ii)  similar  information  is  disseminated  to  local \ncommunities  in  the  project  area,  road  transport  operators,  and  road  users  during  operation  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 21\n\nthe project facilities; and (iii) contractors allow the HIV/AIDS teams to  conduct workshops and \ngive workers time to be tested or receive treatment.  \n \n84. \nLabor. DOR will verify that the Professional Inspectorate monitors the contractors\u2019 hiring \nand equal pay practices as well as wourking conditions, and will encourage women and other \nvulnerable  groups  to  participate  in  project  design  and  implementation.  DOR  will  clearly  state \nwage, worker safety, and work camp living standard requirements in the tender documents and \ncontracts according to relevant laws and government regulations, and will monitor the effects on \nwomen and other vulnerable groups during project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement \n\nBefore  the  disbursement  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan  for  civil  works,  the  agreements \n85. \ncovering  the  loan  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  grant  from  the  PRC,  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  have  been  signed  and  have  become  effective;  or  the \nGovernment will have made alternative funding arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n86. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  25,505,000  to  Mongolia  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  Project \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n\n28 June 2004 \n\n\fc\n~\n\n\"\nV\n\ni\n \n\nG\n\n)\n \n\ni\n;\n\n0\n\nQ\n\n.\n.\n\nC\nO\nO\n>\n\n.\n.\n.\n

 air  transport,  and  inland \nwaterways. Railways are the dominant mode of transport, accounting for 97% of freight in ton-\nkilometers (TKM) and about 55% of passengers in passenger-kilometers (PKM). Road transport \ncarries  most  of  the  remaining  traffic,  accounting  for  about  3%  of  freight  in  TKM  and  20%  of \npassengers  in  PKM.  Air  transport  is  limited  by  poor  quality,  few  operational  airports,  and  high \ncost,  but  it  plays  a  key  role  in  providing  international  access  and  linking  the  otherwise \ninaccessible  aimag  (province)  centers.  The  role  of  inland  waterways  is  limited  to  a  few  lakes \n(e.g., Lake Khovsgol) located mainly in the northern part of the country. \n \n2. \nThe large share of railways is due to neither the relatively large geographic area, nor a \nwell-developed railway network in Mongolia. The railway network extends only 1,920 kilometers \n(km), primarily connecting Suhbaatar at the border with Russia to Zamyn-Uud at the border with \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Mongolia\u2019s  rail  line  density  is  1.2  km  per  km2,  lowest \namong  the  transition  economies  of  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent \nSates. Compared with Mongolia, other transition economies have higher rail line densities, but \nlower share of rail transport.1 It appears that the higher share of railways in Mongolia is primarily \ndue to underdevelopment of its road network, which does not allow for efficient and competitive \nroad transport (para. 4). \n \nDespite its relatively low share, road transport has the potential for rapid growth to meet \n3. \nthe  needs  of  a  reviving  economy.  As  Mongolia  moves  toward  a  free  market  system  and \ntransport  demand  becomes  more  diversified,  the  need  for  transport  services  with  a  greater \ndegree of reliability, flexibility, and efficiency will increase significantly. Road transport is better \nplaced than other transport modes to meet these demands. \n \nB. \n \n\nThe Road Sector \n\n1. \n\nRoad Network \n\n \n4. \nMongolia has a road network of about 49,250 km, connecting 21 major cities and towns \nas well as 160 smaller villages. The network comprises (i) 11,063 km of about 30 state roads \nthat connect Ulaanbaatar with aimag centers, major towns and border crossings; and (ii) 38,187 \nkm of local roads that link aimag centers with smaller villages. Only 12% of the roads (1,670 km) \nare  paved,  13%  (1,800  km)  are  gravel,  and  the  remaining  roads  are  earth  tracks.  Mongolia\u2019s \nroad network lags far behind that of other countries, including its neighbors. Road density (0.03 \nkm per km2) and the share of paved roads (3.4%) in Mongolia are both close to the lower end of \nthe  countries  in  the  world.2  Moreover,  most  of  the  road  network  is  deteriorating  and  a  large \nproportion  remains  impassable  during  the  rainy  or  winter  seasons  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  Kazakhstan  has  a  rail  line  density  of  5  km  per  km2,  but  its  railways  account  for  94%  of  freight \n\ntransport in terms of TKM. \n\n2  The mid range values of road density and the share of paved roads in the world are 0.2 km per km2 and 45.5%, \n\nrespectively.

The  average  annual  growth  rate  was  5.7%  during  1994\u22122003  and  it  accelerated  to \nabout 8% over the last 4 years. In 2003 Mongolia had 138,307 registered vehicles, comprising \n69,531 cars, 27,827 trucks, 26,361 motorcycles, 9,937 buses, and 4,651 trailers (Table A2.1). \nThe country\u2019s vehicle ratio was 45.5 vehicles (four and above wheels) per 1,000 persons, which \nwas  close  to  the  mid-value  in  the world  (45.8 vehicles  per  1,000  persons).  The  rise  in  vehicle \nownership,  which  is  projected  to  continue  in  the  foreseeable  future,  highlights  the  potential \ngrowth of road transport and requires improvement and expansion of the road network. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Registered Vehicles \n(unit) \n\n \n\nYear \n\n1991 \n1994 \n1997 \n2000 \n2003 \n\nCars \n11,890 \n20,663 \n35,578 \n44,051 \n69,531 \n\nTrucks \n29,813 \n30,890 \n30,528 \n29,094 \n27,827 \n\nBuses \n1,928 \n2,500 \n3,982 \n8,548 \n9,937 \n\nMotorcycles \n43,552 \n22,242 \n26,114 \n24,339 \n26,361 \n\nTrailers \n9,110 \n7,436 \n7,170 \n4,406 \n4,651 \n\n   Total \n\n96,293 \n83,731 \n103,372 \n110,438 \n138,307 \n\n3. \n\nRoad Sector Institutions and Regulatory Framework \n\nSources: Traffic Police Department and National Statistical Yearbook, 1999 and 2002. \n \n \n \n6. \nThe Ministry of Infrastructure is responsible for overall transport planning, regulation, and \ncoordination. Within the ministry, the Policy and Coordination Department of Roads, Transport, \nand Tourism formulates transport policy, monitors  its implementation, and liaises with external \naid  agencies.  Implementation  of  road  policy  and  operations  is  undertaken  by  the  Road \nTransport  Agency  and  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR).  While  the  Road  Transport  Agency  is \nresponsible for implementing policies and programs related to road transport operations, DOR is \nresponsible for construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of state roads. DOR is led by the \ndirector general and comprises a technical committee and four divisions, with permanent staff of \n61,  of  whom  41  are  professional  and  20  technical  or  administrative.  In  addition,  50  temporary \nemployees are assigned to externally financed projects. \n \nThe National Transport Advisory Committee, set up in February 1998 and reorganized in \n7. \nMarch 1999 and May 2000, monitors implementation of road sector policies. The committee is \nchaired by the director general of the Policy and Coordination Department of Roads, Transport, \nand Tourism of the Ministry of Infrastructure and comprises representatives of DOR; the Road \nTransport  Agency;  the  State  infrastructure  Control  Agency;  Traffic  Police  Department;  Urban \nTransport Coordination Department, National Transport Association; Trade Union for Workers of \nTransport,  Communications,  and  Petroleum  Companies;  and  state-owned  road  construction \nenterprises. \n \n8. \nMongolia\u2019s road sector policy is based mainly on the Road and Road Transport Sector \nPolicy Statement and two main pieces of legislation: the Road Act and the Road Transport Act, \nwhich were developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance.3 The Road Act, which \nbecame  effective  on  1  February  1998,  includes  provisions  for  road  sector  organizations  and \ninstitutional  jurisdictions,  road  infrastructure  classification  and  technical  standards,  and  road \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.

The Road Transport Act, which took effect on 1 July 1999, focuses on licensing and \nregulatory aspects of the road transport industry. \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \nThe  road  sector  is  financed  primarily  through  the  Road  Fund  that  was  established  in \n9. \n1991, controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and administered by DOR. Resource \nallocation of the Road Fund is part of the Government\u2019s budget process, and the Road Fund is \nfinanced  mainly  from  the  state  budget  and  road  user  taxes.  The  state  Road  Fund  revenues \nincreased from MNT6.4 billion ($6.3 million) in 1999 to MNT19.8 billion ($17.6 million) in 2003, \nwith  the  allocation  from  the  state  budget  and  road  user  taxes  accounting  for  about  70%  and \n30%,  respectively,  of  the  total.  The  state  Road  Fund  revenues  are  used  to  finance  road \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance,  as  well  as  serve  as  counterpart  funds  for \nexternally  assisted  road  projects.  During  1999\u22122003,  road  construction  and  rehabilitation \n(including counterpart funding for externally assisted projects) accounted for about 90% of total \nexpenditures. While the share of road maintenance in total expenditures rose from 5.8% in 1999 \nto 9.3% in 2003, expenses on equipment and research declined from 3.7% to 0.5% during the \nsame period (Table A2.2). \n \n10. \nDespite the recent increases, total Road Fund revenues have been inadequate to meet \nroad  sector  funding  requirements,  which,  ranged  from  45%  to  79%  of  the  amount  needed  by \nDOR.  According  to  a  World  Bank  study,4  Mongolia\u2019s  road  sector  requires  a  minimum  annual \nfunding for capital investment and maintenance equivalent to 2.4% of GDP during 1999\u22122014. \nHowever,  the  actual  funding  during  1999\u22122003  accounted  for  less  than  1%  of  GDP.  Fiscal \ndeficits of the Government (3.6% of GDP in 2003) and a high external debt (103.7% of GDP in \n2003)  are  the  primary  factors  limiting  government  funding  for  the  road  sector.  The  lack  of  an \nupdated  sector  strategy  also  exacerbates  the  problem  because  without  the  strategy  the \nGovernment is unable to allocate limited financial resources to priority projects on the basis of \nthe  country\u2019s  development  strategy  and  sound  technical  and  economic  analyses.  As  a  result, \npart  of  the  Road  Fund  revenues  has  been  used  for  unplanned  new  projects,  particularly \nconstruction of the millennium road. Moreover, despite increases in the retail price of gasoline \nand diesel, the fuel taxes have not been adjusted since 1995. Vehicle license fees have also not \nbeen  allocated  to  the  state  Road  Fund,  but  instead  have  been  appropriated  to  local \ngovernments for purposes not related to roads. \n \n\nTable A2.2: State Road Fund Revenues and Expenditures, 1999\u22122003 \n(MNT million) \n\nItem \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\nRevenue \n  State Budget \n  Road User Taxes \n  Other Donations and Contributions \nExpenditure \n  Road Construction and Rehabilitation \n  Counterpart Funds of Foreign Loan \n     Projects \n  Road Maintenance \n  Equipment \n  Research  \n  Other \n\n6,423.3 \n2,941.7 \n3,481.0 \n0.6 \n6,421.8 \n2,225.4 \n3,539.3 \n\n7,941.7  11,026.5 \n6,010.4 \n3,672.3 \n4,654.8 \n4,222.0 \n361.3 \n47.4 \n7,910.0  10,720.4 \n3,491.9 \n2,379.5 \n4,772.3 \n3,843.7 \n\n369.9 \n182.0 \n53.6 \n51.6 \n\n1,468.9 \n97.3 \n51.0 \n69.6 \n\n2,050.7 \n128.9 \n78.0 \n198.6 \n\n14,283.0 \n9,323.0 \n4,839.6 \n120.4 \n14,162.6 \n8,203.9 \n3,452.4 \n\n2,227.7 \n138.0 \n0.0 \n140.6 \n\n19,822.9 \n14,033.5 \n5789.4 \n0.0 \n19,822.9 \n13,387.1 \n4,468.6 \n\n1,833.9 \n101.7 \n0.0 \n31.6 \n\nSource: Department of Roads. \n                                                 \n4  World  Bank.  1999.

The Road \nBoard  is  chaired  by  the  Scientific  Secretary  of  the  Transport  Institute  and  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  Ministries  of  Finance  and  Economy,  Infrastructure;  DOR;  Traffic  Police \nDepartment; major road transport companies, and transport nongovernment organizations. \n \n12. \nfinancial \nmanagement  of  road  sector  accounts,  including  preparing  the  budget  of  the  Road  Fund, \nmonitoring,  and  accounting  of  its  revenues  and  expenditures  as  well  as  road  sector  projects \nimplemented  by  DOR.  The  division  has  eight  staff  members.  With  ADB  technical  assistance \n(footnote  3),  DOR\u2019s  financial  management  has  improved.  DOR  has  adopted  accounting  and \nauditing procedures according to the Law on Accounting (approved in 2002) and the State Audit \nLaw  (approved  in  2003),  which  are  based  on  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards. \nDOR\u2019s  performance  in  submitting  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  ADB-\nassisted  projects  has  been  satisfactory.  However,  DOR\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  has \nbeen constrained due to inadequate provision of government budgets. Despite rapid increases \nin  road  investment  in  recent  years,  funding  allocated  from  the  state  budget  for  financial \nmanagement in DOR remains the same. The result is shortage of staff in the Administration and \nFinance Division. \n \n\nis  responsible \n\nfor \n\n5. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \n13. \nRoad maintenance funding has been inadequate to cover the needs of the road network. \nExpenditures  on  road  maintenance  from  the  state  Road  Fund  increased  from  MNT370  million \n($0.4 million) in 1999 to MNT1.8 billion ($1.6 million) in 2003, but it accounted for about 25% of \nthe amount requested by DOR and less than 0.2% of GDP, and was lower than in many other \nAsian countries.5 Road maintenance funding from the Road Fund in 2004 increased significantly \nby more than 170% to MNT5.0 billion ($4.2 million). While this represented progress made on \nimproving  road  maintenance  funding,  continued  efforts  are  needed  to  fully  address  this  issue. \nInadequate  funding  for  road  maintenance  will  not  prevent  further  deterioration  of  the  road \nnetwork and remedy the accumulation of deferred maintenance. According to the Road Board, \nthe present conditions of the road network reach at best about 60% of the required level. \n \n14. \nThe  problem  of  inadequate  funding  for  road  maintenance  in  Mongolia  is  similar  to  that \nexperienced  in  many  other  developing  countries.  Fiscal  constraints  have  made  it  increasingly \ndifficult  for  the  Government  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  the  road  sector.  Within  the  road \nsector,  priority  is  usually  given  to  road  construction  and  rehabilitation  (including  counterpart \nfunding  for  externally  assisted  projects).  Road  maintenance  should  be  excluded  from  the \ngovernment budget process and be funded primarily  from  road charges (e.g., road user taxes \nand fees) set at levels reflecting the costs that vehicles impose on the road system. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  recently  took  steps  to  increase  funding  for  road  maintenance. \nFollowing  the  substantial  rise  in  road  maintenance  funding  in  2004,  the  Government  plans  to \nfurther  increase  it  to  MNT5.5  billion  in  2005.  The  establishment  of  the  Road  Board  will  help \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  Road  Fund  resources  allocated  for  road  maintenance.  The  Road \nBoard recommended to the Ministry of Finance and Economy in April 2004 that the Road Fund \nbe used primarily for road maintenance and that road maintenance funding be further increased. \nAs  a  first  step  in  encouraging  a  private  road  maintenance  industry,  the  Government  has \nremoved  route  maintenance  activities  from  state-owned  companies  or  joint  shareholding \n                                                 \n5  For  example,  the  share  of  road  maintenance  expenditures  to  GDP  was  1%  in  the  PRC,  0.7%  in  Viet  Nam,  and \n\n0.5% in Kazakhstan in the early to mid-1990s (footnote 4). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n29\n\ncompanies. With support from the Nordic Development Fund, the Government is formulating a \nroad maintenance plan to provide a sustainable technical basis for the funds allocated for road \nmaintenance.  In  addition,  road  maintenance  equipment  was  procured  with  funding  from  ADB \nand  the  World  Bank,  and  a  framework  for  the  management  and  operation  of  the  stock \nmaintenance equipment was established with ADB assistance. \n \n\n6. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \nRoad accidents have increased significantly since the mid-1990s, with the total number \n16. \ngrowing from 860 in 1995 to 5,553 in 2002 (Table A2.3). The number of fatalities rose slightly, \nbut  the  number  of  injuries  doubled  during  1995\u22122002.  The  increase  in  road  accidents  in  the \nurban areas (particularly in Ulaanbaatar) was more rapid than in the rural areas. Road accidents \nin the urban areas rose by about 750% during this period, compared with a 250% increase in \nthe rural areas. Road accident fatalities in the urban areas increased by 50%, while the number \nof  deaths  was  relatively  unchanged  in  the  rural  areas.  However,  road  accidents  in  the  rural \nareas  rose  significantly  in  2002,  accounting  for  two  thirds  of  the  total  fatalities  in  the  country. \nThe main reasons were poor driving skills, high speeds, intoxicated driving, careless behavior of \npedestrians, deficient road conditions, and technical problems with vehicles. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Road Traffic Accidents \n\nItem \n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\nUrban Areas \n  Accidents (no.) \n  Deaths (no.) \n  Injuries (no.) \nRural Areas \n  Accidents (no.) \n  Deaths (no.) \n  Injuries (no.) \nTotal \n  Accidents (no.) \n  Deaths (no.) \n  Injuries (no.) \n\n513\n82\n476\n\n347\n212\n389\n\n860\n294\n865\n\n794\n115\n826\n\n412\n194\n457\n\n1,206\n309\n1,283\n\n4,330\n123\n930\n\n721\n173\n558\n\n5,051\n296\n1,488\n\n2000 \n \n5,074 \n141 \n940 \n \n917 \n197 \n676 \n \n5,991 \n338 \n1,616 \n\n2001 \n \n4,398 \n97 \n878 \n \n927 \n238 \n734 \n \n5,325 \n335 \n1612 \n\n2002\n\n4,358\n122\n818\n\n1,195\n205\n818\n\n5,553\n327\n1,636\n\nSources: Traffic Police Department and National Statistical Yearbook, 1999 and 2002. \n \n17.  While the number of road accidents increased, the severity of accidents has decreased. \nThe fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles declined by 50% during 1995\u22122002. Deaths per accident \ndecreased  from  0.34  to  0.06,  and  injuries  from  1.01  to  0.29  during  the  same  period. \nNevertheless,  the  fatality  rate  for  2002  was  about  24  persons  per  10,000  vehicles,  which \nremained  higher  than  in  many  other  Asian  countries.6  With  the  present  rate  of  growth  in \nvehicles, there is the potential for more road accidents. \n \n18.  Mongolia approved the Law on Road Safety and became a member of the International \nConvention  on  Road  Signage  in  1996.  The  Road  Signage  Standards  were  updated  in  2003, \ntraffic safety regulations are being updated, and the standards on road marking and lighting are \nunder  review.  Road  safety  guidelines  were  developed  with  ADB  assistance.7  An  accident \nreporting system was revised and a vehicle inspection system developed and implemented with \nWorld  Bank  assistance.  Nevertheless,  road  safety  features  (e.g.,  markings,  signage,  and \nguardrails)  are  lacking  on  some  road  sections  including  the  Altanbulag-Ulaanbaatar  section. \n                                                 \n6  For example, the road accident fatality rate in the PRC for 2001 was 17 persons per 10,000 vehicles. \n7  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGovernment Strategy and Priorities for the Road Sector \n\nMoreover,  enforcement  of  traffic  safety  regulations  is  weak  due  to  the  limited  capacity  of  the \nTraffic  Police  Department,  as  most  traffic  police  officers  have  received  neither  appropriate \ntraining  nor  adequate  equipment  (e.g.,  patrol  vehicles,  breath  analyzers,  speed  monitoring \nequipment, and communication radios). Strong efforts are needed to (i) install safety features on \nall  state  roads,  (ii)  promote  public  awareness  of  traffic  safety,  (iii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of \ntraffic  police  officers  through  training,  and  (iv)  provide  the  Traffic  Police  Department  with \nequipment  such  as  patrol  vehicles  equipped  with  breath  analyzers  and  portable  speed \nmonitoring  equipment,  and  two-way  communication  radios  to  enforce  the  implementation  of \nroad traffic regulations. \n \nC. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  road  sector  strategy  aims  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  road \n19. \ntransport  system  and  services  to  facilitate  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  \nThe  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  favorable  environment  needed  for  developing  a \ncompetitive  road  transport  industry,  (ii)  increasing  investment  on  road  construction  and \nrehabilitation to reduce Mongolia\u2019s isolation from world markets and improve the accessibility of \nisolated  communities  within  the  country,  (iii)  increasing  funding  for  road  maintenance,  \n(iv) improving the efficiency of state-owned transport enterprises, and (v) improving road safety. \n \n20.  While  important  progress  has  been  made  on  creating  a  favorable  climate  for  a \ncompetitive road transport industry, severe budgetary constraints have limited the progress on \nincreasing  funding  for  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and  improving  road  safety. \nMoreover,  the  strategy  should  review  the  need  to  maintain  and  improve  the  existing  road \nnetwork  in  areas  with  low  population  densities.  A  Road  Master  Plan  prepared  with  ADB \nassistance8 and approved by the Government identified priority road sections for investment and \nimprovement,  but  the  Road  Master  Plan  needs  updating  as  many  priority  projects  identified \nhave been constructed or are under construction. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  plans,  with  external  assistance,  to  develop  a  new  transport  sector \nstrategy and update the Road Master Plan based on the country\u2019s development priority and the \navailability of financial resources. The new transport sector strategy will, among others, assess \ntotal  funding  requirements  to  maintain  the  existing  road  network,  identify  major  funding \nconstraints, and recommend how to address these constraints over the medium term. A working \ngroup, chaired jointly by ADB and the World Bank, was established in April 2004 to coordinate \nassistance to the Government in preparing the transport sector strategy. Over the medium term, \nthe  Government  accords  high  priority  to  developing  the  country\u2019s  two  key  road  corridors:  \n(i)  a  north-south  corridor  linking  Mongolia  with  the  PRC  and  Russia,  and  (ii)  an  east-west \ncorridor (i.e., the millennium road) linking several aimag centers with Ulaanbaatar. \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995.

\n\nBackground and Rationale \n\nA. \n \nMongolia  is  at  the  early  stage  of  HIV/AIDS1 epidemics  with  only  four  registered  cases \n1. \ntransmitted  mainly  through  sexual  contact.2 However,  the  country  is  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS \ndiseases  due  to  the  high-risk  behavior  among  young  population,  an  increasing  number  of  sex \nworkers  with  poor  condom  use,  high  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs),  and \nrapidly  growing  HIV/AIDS  diseases  in  neighboring  countries.  With  high  poverty  incidence, \nwomen  are  disproportionately  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  for  prostitution. \nSystematic trafficking cases have been reported.3 \n \n2. \nThe Regional Road Development  Project will build the remaining section of Mongolia\u2019s \nnorth-south road transport corridor between Choyr and the border with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC)  in  Zamyn-Uud 4  to  link  the  Asian  highway  networks  of  the  PRC  and  Russia.  \nThe  Project  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nbecause  of  a  large  number  of  workers  employed  during  construction  and  the  increased \nmovement of passengers across the borders with the PRC and Russia after project completion.5 \nThe technical assistance (TA) will mitigate potential risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human \ntrafficking along the north-south road corridor. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe goal of the TA is to reduce the risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking that may be \n3. \nassociated  with  the  construction  of  the  project  road  and  operation  of  the  north-south  road \ntransport  corridor  after  project  completion.  The  purposes  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  raise  public \nawareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking;  (ii)  address  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission \namong  construction  workers,  sex  workers,  local  communities,  truck  drivers,  and  other  road \nusers; and (iii) strengthen border control capacity against human trafficking.  \n \n4. \nTo achieve these objectives, the short-term strategy will focus on (i) creating awareness \nof  HIV/AIDS  including  the  transmission  channel  of  drug  use,  and  human  trafficking  among \nconstruction  workers,  sex  workers,  and  local  communities;  (ii)  promoting  behavior  change;  \n(iii)  promoting  use  of  condoms;  (iv)  implementing  STI/HIV/AIDS  prevention  services,  including \nSTI treatment and voluntary counseling and testing services at construction camps and in local \ncommunities; and (v) enhancing STI/HIV/AIDS monitoring. The long-term strategy will focus on \n(i)  building  HIV/AIDS  prevention  capacity  of  communities  along  the  north-south  road  and  at \nborders;  (ii)  promoting  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  among  business \ncommunities  (particularly  construction  companies,  transport  operators,  and  hotels),  border \nauthorities, and media; and (iii) strengthening border control and establishing a regional network \namong  Mongolia,  the  PRC,  and  Russia  for  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  \nThe TA will contribute to the achievement of the long-term strategy. \n\n                                                 \n1  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  The  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on  HIV/AIDS  estimates  that  about  300  persons  might  be  infected  with  HIV  in \n\nMongolia by the end of 2003.  \n\n3  An attempted trafficking of over 400 Mongolian girls was recently reported in the UB Post on 30 January 2004. \n4  In 2001, there were 1.4 million inbound and outbound passengers in Mongolia, of whom 50% traveled via Zamyn-\n\nUud, 16% via Suhbaatar, and the rest through other border posts. \n\n5  Mobile populations are among the main transmitters of HIV/AIDS infection. Construction workers, transport workers, \n\ntruck drivers, and traders compose key mobile groups.   \n\n\f44\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  TA  will  be  built  on  the  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Government  and  United  Nations \n5. \nagencies,  particularly  the  World  Health  Organization  and  the  Global  Fund  for  Fight  against \nHIV/AIDS.6 In particular, technical capacity and coordination mechanisms are available to share \nfor  TA  implementation.  The  TA  will  complement  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  covenant  that  causes \ncontractors  to  disseminate  information  on  HIV/AIDS/STIs  to  the  workers  employed  during \nproject  implementation  and  allow  employees  to  attend  health  education,  to  be  tested,  or  to \nreceive basic treatment; and (ii) the area development component of the Project. \n \n6. \nnorth-south road corridor and at borders: \n \n\nThe  TA  comprises  five  components  to  be  undertaken  at  construction  sites  along  the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAdvocacy  workshops.  To  improve  understanding  of  the  awareness  and \nprevention  program  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  among  stakeholders, \nadvocacy  workshops  will  be  conducted.  The  workshops  will  target  local \ngovernments  and  communities,  owners  of  hotels  and  entertainment \nestablishments, \ntransport \nlocal  police,  road  construction \noperators,  business  communities,  media, \ncompanies and contractors, and the aimag branches of the Department of Roads \n(DOR) along the north-south road, and border and custom offices.  \n\nrelevant  nongovernment  organizations \n\n(NGOs), \n\nSupport  for  in-depth  behavior  change. Intensive health education campaigns \nand  peer  education  will  be  undertaken  to  promote  behavior  change  among \nconstruction  workers,  sex  workers,  and  local  people  in  the  project  area. \nKnowledge  will  be  disseminated  through  posters,  pamphlets,  focus  groups,  and \nlaunch  events  in  Mongolian  and  Chinese  languages 7 during  construction  and \nafter  the  opening  of  the  project  road.  NGOs  will  be  identified  to  facilitate \neducation  for  sex  workers.  The  National  AIDS  Foundation  will  help  the  aimag \nhealth  departments  organize  peer  education  through  sensitization  workshops, \ninitial  training,  and  regular  monitoring  visits.8 Condoms  will  be  made  available \nfree  of  charge  or  at  low  prices  during  the  first  2  years  of  construction  of  the \nproject road. \n\nComprehensive  medical  package.  The  TA  will  supervise  STI  treatments  at \nconstruction camps, conduct training for health workers on STI management and \nVCT services, and provide STI drugs to cover excess needs that might arise from \nroad  construction. 9  HIV  testing  kits  will  be  provided  to  construction  areas.  \nAimag  health  departments  and  the  National  Center  for  Communicable  Disease \nControl will supervise the performance of health workers and provide supplies.10  \n\nBorder  control  and  cross-border  cooperation  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman  trafficking.11 This  comprises  four  subcomponents:  (a)  Training  will  be \nconducted  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  border  officers  against  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman  trafficking.  Training  will  be  first  organized  at  the  national  level  for \nthen  at  border  offices.  \nrelevant  NGOs,  and \ngovernment  officials  and \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6  This  includes  information  and  education  campaigns,  STI  services,  the  100%  condom  use  program,  provision  of \n\nVCT services, surveillance systems, and regional cooperation on fight against HIV/AIDS. \n\n7  More than half of construction workers in Mongolia are Chinese.  \n8  The Global Fund has used this operational modality for peer education nationwide. \n9  The national health system will provide STI treatments free of charge or at low prices to insured people. \n10 The Global Fund has used this operational modality for medical support nationwide. \n11 ADB is contacting other aid agencies for possible funding for the same activities in Russia. \n\n\fAppendix 11   \n\n45\n\n(b)  International  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  work  with  relevant  government \nagencies, local institutes such as the Center for Human Rights and Development, \nand NGOs for capacity building. (c) Workshops will be organized for participants \nfrom Mongolia and the PRC to discuss the possibility of establishing cross-border \ncooperation  mechanisms  and  exchange  information  on  the  fight  against \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  (d)  Basic  equipment  will  be  provided  to  help \nborder offices identify and register suspects. \n\nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  system  in  construction  areas.  \nA BME system will be set up to strengthen the existing surveillance systems. The \nBME system will accommodate the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) need for \nproject performance and monitoring. In addition to performance indicators, sexual \nbehavior,  treatment-seeking  behavior,  and  prevalence  of  STI  will  be  monitored. \nSurveys will be conducted to collect baseline data and assess progress. \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe estimated costs of the TA and the proposed financing plan are given in Table A11.1. \n7. \nADB  financing  will  be  funded  from  its  TA  funding  program.

The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  of  the  ADB-assisted  Second \nHealth Sector Development Project (Loan 1998) will be the Implementing Agency. A full-time TA \ncoordinator will be appointed at the PIU, and two small offices with part-time assistants will be \nset  up  at  the  health  departments  of  Govisumber  and  Dornogovi  aimags  in  Choyr  and \nSaynshand, respectively. A steering committee at the national level will be established to guide \nTA  implementation.  The  steering  committee  will  be  chaired  by  a  vice  minister  of  health  and \ncomprise  representatives  of  the  PIU  of  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project,  DOR, \nministries of health and justice and home affairs, the General Customs Office, and an existing \ntechnical  expert  group.  Advisory  groups  will  also  be  set  up  at  local  levels,  chaired  by  the \ngovernors\u2019 offices and comprising representatives of aimag health and road departments, local \ntransport  operators,  local  police,  border  and  customs  officers,  local  communities,  and  relevant \nNGOs. The TA is expected to begin in February 2005 and be completed in July 2009. \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  1.5  person-months  of  international  and  160  person-months  of \n9. \ndomestic  consulting  services.  The \ninternational  consultant  should  have  expertise  and \nexperience  in  anti-human  trafficking.  The  domestic  consultants  should  have  expertise  in  anti-\nhuman  trafficking,  health  education  and  advocacy,  HIV/AIDS/STI  medical  services,  and \nepidemiological  surveillance  and  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Equipment,  supplies,  and  materials \nunder the TA will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.

The analysis uses 2003 economic prices2 and covers the period of 2006\u22122025, \ncomprising 3 years of construction and 17 years of operation. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nwas used for making traffic forecasts:  \n \n\nTraffic forecasts for the project road were  made for 2006\u22122025. A three-stage process \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nInitial  traffic  forecasts  were  based  on  an  analysis  of  macro  level  demographic \nand economic trends for Mongolia, as well as for the corridor between Choyr and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) border in Zamyn-Uud. \n\nMacro  level  forecasts  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  between  Choyr  and \nZamyn-Uud  were  disaggregated  into  road  and  rail  transport,  based  on  the  data \ngathered from interviews, traffic surveys, and published reports and statistics on \nrecent and anticipated modal shares. \n\nBased  on  traffic  survey  data  and  actual  traffic  patterns  along  the  project  road, \nroad  traffic  projections  were  further  disaggregated  into  three  types  of  traffic:  \n(a)  normal  traffic,  or  existing  traffic  in  the  absence  of  the  Project,  (b)  generated \ntraffic,  or  traffic  that  develops  due  to  reduced  transport  costs  or  increased \nbusiness  activities  in  the  project  area,  and  (c)  diverted  traffic,  or  traffic  that  is \ndiverted from the existing railway to the project road. \n\n \n3. \nMongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and population are projected to grow by 4.5% \nand 0.95% per annum, respectively, during 2006\u22122025. GDP and population growth projections \nare  largely  in  line  with  recent  growth  rates.  Based  on  economic  and  demographic  growth \nprojections, traffic for the corridor between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud is forecast \nto  grow  by  6.3%  for  freight  traffic  in  ton-kilometers  (TKM)  and  5.1%  for  passenger  traffic  in \npassenger-kilometers  (PKM)  per  annum  during  2006\u22122025  (Table  A12.1).  The  growth  rate  of \nprojected traffic is higher than that of GDP because the transport intensity of the economy has \nincreased in recent years with freight transport intensity growing at a faster rate than passenger \ntransport intensity.3 \n \n4. \nTransport  between  Choyr  and  Zamyn-Uud  is  by  road  and  rail.  Based  on  the  existing \nmodal shares and an analysis of traffic patterns derived from traffic surveys,4 projected corridor \ntraffic  was  disaggregated  into  road  and  rail  modes  (Table  A12.1).  The  railway  is  projected  to \nremain  the  dominant  mode  of  transport,  although  its  shares  in  terms  of  TKM  and  PKM  are \nexpected  to  decrease  gradually.  The  road  is  projected  to  attract  traffic,  particularly  passenger \ntraffic from 2009, the first year of operation of the project road. The road\u2019s share is projected to \nincrease from 3.7% to 23.8% in PKM and 0.4% to 5.8% in TKM during 2006\u22122025.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The  economic  analysis  covers  Mongolia  only  and  does  not  take  into  account  the  project  benefits  accruing  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. \n\n2  The feasibility study was completed at the end of 2003.  \n3  Freight transport intensity tripled from 1.99 to 5.96 TKM of GDP, while passenger transport intensity increased by \n\n63.8% from 1.16 to 1.90 PKM of GDP during 1995\u22122002. \n\n4  Factors  such  as  commodity  type,  distance,  and  cost  for  freight  transport,  and  distance  and  cost  for  passenger \ntransport were used to project traffic for rail and road modes along the corridor between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n 49\n\nTable A12.1 Traffic Projections for the Corridor Between Chyor and Zamyn-Uud \n\nFreight Traffic (TKM million) \n\nRailway \n4,238.7 \n4,555.7 \n4,882.6 \n4,955.0 \n5,290.1 \n5,694.6 \n6,113.0 \n6,546.4 \n6,996.1 \n7,463.3 \n7,976.9 \n8,511.0 \n9,122.2 \n9,701.9 \n10,362.5 \n10,883.5 \n11,292.5 \n11,733.5 \n12,209.2 \n12,722.3 \n\nRoad \n15.8 \n16.8 \n17.7 \n240.2 \n259.7 \n281.7 \n305.2 \n330.3 \n357.1 \n385.8 \n417.0 \n450.4 \n486.7 \n524.8 \n566.3 \n608.0 \n648.5 \n691.9 \n735.9 \n783.4 \n\nTotal \n4,254.5 \n4,572.5 \n4,900.3 \n5,195.2 \n5,549.7 \n5,976.2 \n6,418.1 \n6,876.7 \n7,353.2 \n7,849.0 \n8,393.9 \n8,961.3 \n9,608.9 \n10,226.7 \n10,928.7 \n11,491.5 \n11,940.9 \n12,425.4 \n12,945.2 \n13,505.7 \n\nPassenger Traffic (PKM million) \nRailway \n831.0 \n867.3 \n904.8 \n823.5 \n860.0 \n915.1 \n963.1 \n1,012.7 \n1,064.0 \n1,117.1 \n1,172.0 \n1,250.5 \n1,309.6 \n1,371.0 \n1,434.7 \n1,479.4 \n1,526.9 \n1,577.1 \n1,630.4 \n1,686.9 \n\nRoad \n31.8 \n33.7 \n35.5 \n251.5 \n263.0 \n279.8 \n294.6 \n310.0 \n326.0 \n342.5 \n359.7 \n383.6 \n402.2 \n421.5 \n441.6 \n456.6 \n472.4 \n489.3 \n507.1 \n526.0 \n\nTotal \n862.8 \n901.0 \n940.3 \n1,075.0 \n1,122.9 \n1,194.8 \n1,257.7 \n1,322.7 \n1,390.0 \n1,459.6 \n1,531.7 \n1,634.1 \n1,711.8 \n1,792.4 \n1,876.3 \n1,936.0 \n1,999.3 \n2,066.4 \n2,137.5 \n2,212.8 \n\n \n\nYear \n \n\n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n \nBased on the projected corridor traffic, traffic surveys5 conducted along the project road \n5. \nalignment  in  August\u2212September  2003,  and  the  data  provided  by  the  Department  of  Roads, \ntraffic  forecasts  for  with-  and  without-  project  cases  were  made  (Table  A12.2).  In  the  without-\nproject case, traffic would continue to move along the existing multiple unimproved earth tracks \n(normal  traffic).  The  average  daily  traffic  (ADT)  will  remain  relatively  low,  from  288  vehicles  in \n2006 to 864 vehicles in 2025. In the with-project case, ADT will increase significantly from 2009 \nsince  the  road  will  create  diverted  and  generated  traffic.  ADT  is  projected  to  grow  from  288 \nvehicles in 2006 to 3,075 vehicles in 2025. Regional traffic (i.e., traffic from and to Mongolia and \ntransit  traffic  via  Mongolia)  is  projected  to  constitute  the  bulk  of  total  traffic,  with  its  share \ngrowing from 30% in 2006 to 75% in 2025. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThere  are  four  ways  of  meeting  the  projected  road  traffic  between  Choyr  and  Zamyn-\nUud: (i) construction of a asphalt concrete road; (ii) construction of a road with double bitumen \nsurface treatment (DBST) surface; (iii) construction of a gravel road; and (iv) expansion of the \ncapacity  of  the  existing  railway  instead  of  constructing  the  project  road,  given  that  the \npreliminary  alignment  for  the  project  road  roughly  parallels  the  railway  line.  An  alternatives \nanalysis was undertaken to select the most appropriate project alternative. \n \n7. \nCosts  and  benefits  of  the  project  alternatives  used  a  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a \nshadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.07  (based  on  the  2002  data)  to  estimate  foreign  exchange \neffects.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable  materials,  equipment,  skilled  labor, \nand unskilled labor. A composite conversion factor of 1.0078 was used to express the Project\u2019s \ncapital  costs  as  economic  costs  (Table  A12.3  explains  the  computation  of  the  composite \n\nAlternatives Analysis \n\n                                                 \n5  The surveys included (i) traffic counts and origin-destination surveys conducted in August 2003 along the project \nroad  alignment,  (ii)  vehicle  axle  load  survey  conducted  in  September  2003  along  the  project  road  alignment,  \n(iii)  border  survey  conducted  in  August  2003  at  the  Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian  Hot  post,  and  (iv)  survey  of  road-based \nbusiness establishments conducted in September 2003 along the Ulaanbaatar-Darhan road. \n\n\f50\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconversion factor). A shadow wage rate factor of 0.76 was used to estimate the economic price \nof  unskilled  workers,  considering  that  if  unemployed  people  are  hired  under  the  Project,  their \neconomic  opportunity  costs  would  likely  be  zero  or  close  to  zero.  Skilled  workers  are  not \nshadow  priced  since  there  is  no  surplus  of  skilled  workers  in  Mongolia.  Costs  for  the  road \noptions  comprise  costs  of  construction  and  maintenance,  while  costs  for  the  railway  option \ncomprises  costs  of  additional  investment,  maintenance,  and  operating  costs.  The  opportunity \ncost of land is assumed to be zero since the land along the alignment is low in quality with no \nalternative beneficial use. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Projected Average Daily Traffic between Choyr and Zamyn-Uud \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n\nWithout \nProject \n\nNormal  Generated  Diverted \n\nTotal Traffic \n\nWith Project \n\nDomestic \n\nTraffic \nfrom/to \nMongolia \n76 \n77 \n84 \n628 \n653 \n696 \n732 \n770 \n806 \n846 \n885 \n948 \n990 \n1,033 \n1,078 \n1,104 \n1,130 \n1,158 \n1,189 \n1,220 \n\nTransit \nTraffic via \nMongolia \n11 \n12 \n13 \n389 \n415 \n442 \n472 \n502 \n537 \n572 \n611 \n652 \n694 \n741 \n790 \n843 \n896 \n953 \n1,013 \n1,077 \n\n201 \n216 \n225 \n332 \n350 \n371 \n393 \n415 \n438 \n462 \n487 \n517 \n546 \n577 \n608 \n638 \n669 \n704 \n739 \n778 \n\nTotal \n\n288 \n305 \n322 \n1,349 \n1,418 \n1,509 \n1,597 \n1,687 \n1,781 \n1,880 \n1,983 \n2,117 \n2,230 \n2,351 \n2,476 \n2,585 \n2,695 \n2,815 \n2,941 \n3,075 \n\n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\n288 \n305 \n322 \n341 \n361 \n382 \n405 \n429 \n454 \n481 \n509 \n540 \n572 \n607 \n643 \n682 \n723 \n767 \n814 \n864 \n\n288 \n305 \n322 \n341 \n361 \n382 \n405 \n429 \n454 \n481 \n509 \n540 \n572 \n607 \n643 \n682 \n723 \n767 \n814 \n864 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n34 \n36 \n38 \n41 \n43 \n45 \n48 \n51 \n54 \n57 \n61 \n64 \n68 \n72 \n77 \n81 \n86 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n974 \n1,021 \n1,089 \n1,151 \n1,215 \n1,282 \n1,351 \n1,423 \n1,523 \n1,601 \n1,683 \n1,769 \n1,834 \n1,900 \n1,971 \n2,045 \n2,125 \n\n \n\nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n \n\nItem \n\nTable A12.3: Computation of Composite Conversion Factor \n  \nShare within \nCategory (%) \n\nMaterials \n  Tradable Materials (i.e., cement, steel) \n  Nontradable Materials (i.e., gravel, sand) \nLabor \n  Skilled Labor \n  Unskilled Labor \nEquipment \n  Tradable Equipment \n  Nontradable Equipment  \nComposite Conversion Factor \n\n40.0 \n60.0 \n \n60.0 \n40.0 \n \n\n      100.0 \n0.0 \n \n\nConversion \nFactor \n \n1.07 \n1.00 \n \n1.00 \n0.70 \n \n1.07 \n1.00 \n \n\nShare of Project \nCost (%) \n35.0 \n \n \n25.0 \n \n \n40.0 \n \n \n \n\nWeighted \nValue \n\n \n\n0.1498 \n0.2100 \n \n0.1500 \n0.0700 \n \n0.4280 \n0.0000 \n1.0078 \n\nSource: Technical assistance consultant.  \n \n                                                 \n6  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  (SWRF)  is  the  ratio  between  its  shadow  wage  rate  and  its  price  (Appendix  12  of \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects). The SWRF of 0.7 is calculated based on the assumption that the \naverage  monthly  wage  for  project  labor  is  MNT80,000  while  the  shadow  wage  rate  for  unskilled  labor  is \nMNT56,000 (the average of the wages to employees of MNT50,000 and MNT62,000 inclusive of taxes).    \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n 51\n\nEconomic  benefits  consist  of  savings  on  transport  costs  and  travel  time  for  freight  and \n8. \npassenger  traffic,  which  are  valued  in  terms  of  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings  for \nnormal traffic, (ii) difference in cost and travel time of using the railway and the project road for \ndiverted traffic, and (iii) 50% of VOC savings from normal traffic as proxy for willingness to pay \nfor generated traffic. Transport cost savings embody the value of time saved by vehicle drivers \nand crews, but not by passengers or cargo. The value of time saved by passengers traveling to \nwork was calculated at $0.50 per hour. For passengers traveling for leisure, 25% of the value of \nthe work time saved is used as proxy for willingness to pay for a nonbusiness trip. The value of \ntime saved for freight is estimated at $0.16 per ton per day, based on an average value of $500 \nper ton at a 12% opportunity cost of capital. \n \n9. \nThe  alternatives  analysis  was  carried  out  in  two  phases.  On  the  first  level,  the  three \nalternatives  for  the  project  road  were  compared  to  determine  the  appropriate  type  of  road \nsurface. The results (Table A12.4) show that the gravel road option has the lowest value, with \nan  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  26.4%  and  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  $68.2 \nmillion. In terms of EIRR, the highest value is for the DBST road option (30.4%) and the second \nhighest  value  is  for  the  asphalt  concrete  road  option  (29.7%).  In  terms  of  NPV,  the  asphalt \nconcrete road option ($131.3 million) shows a higher value than the DBST road option ($121.9 \nmillion). In view of NPV and given that the project road forms part of the Asian highway network \nand other sections of the north-south road corridor between Altanbulag and Choyr are asphalt \nconcrete,  the  asphalt  concrete  road  option  appears  a  better  choice  than  the  DBST  option.  \nOn  the  second  level,  comparison  is  made  between  the  asphalt  concrete  road  option  and  the \nrailway  option.  The  results  show  that  the  railway  alternative  has  a  lower  EIRR  value  (19.7%) \nand  NPV  ($59.1  million),  and  is  thus  less  economically  feasible.  Based  on  the  alternatives \nanalysis,  development  of  an  asphalt  concrete  road  between  Choyr  and  the  PRC  border  in \nZamyn-Uud is the economically efficient option for increasing transport capacity on this corridor.  \n\n\fTable A12.4: Economic Feasibility Results of Project Alternatives  \n($ million) \n\nCapital \nCosta \n19.44 \n27.37 \n31.33 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00

\n\nC. \n \n10. \nThe Project\u2019s primary benefit is transport cost savings due to the improved road surface \nroughness7 and resultant increases in vehicle speeds. Transport cost savings are estimated to \naccount for 96% of the total project benefits. For nine types of vehicles, the Project is expected \nto result in an average VOC reduction of 43.1% per unit traveling between Choyr and the PRC \nborder in Zamyn-Uud, ranging between 36.1% per car and 45.5% per heavy bus (Table A12.5). \nThe benefits from VOC savings, which initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will be \nshared  gradually  with  users  of  road  transport  services  through  reduced  freight  rates  and \npassenger fares. \n \n\nTable A12.5: Vehicle Operating Cost by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle per trip)  \n\nItem \nCar \nJeep \nLight Truck \nMedium Truck \nHeavy Truck \nArticulated Truck \nLight Bus \nMedium Bus \nHeavy Bus \n\nAverage \n\nWithout Project \n95.5 \n197.0 \n246.3 \n359.3 \n549.1 \n767.3 \n224.5 \n338.4 \n403.8 \n353.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWith Project \n61.0 \n119.4 \n143.2 \n203.4 \n310.3 \n422.8 \n134.9 \n195.1 \n220.2 \n201.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nVOC Savings \n34.5 \n77.5 \n103.2 \n156.0 \n238.9 \n344.5 \n89.6 \n143.2 \n183.6 \n152.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSavings (%) \n\n36.1 \n39.3 \n41.9 \n43.4 \n43.5 \n44.9 \n39.9 \n42.3 \n45.5 \n43.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nVOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  benefits  include  savings  on  travel  time  because  of  the  relatively  straight \nalignment of the project road and increased vehicle speeds. The Project is expected to reduce \nthe average travel time between Choyr and the PRC border in Zamyn-Uud by 56%, from 13.4 \nhours to 5.9 hours per trip (Table A12.6). The Project will contribute to reduce road accidents, \nbut  such  benefits  are  not  quantifiable  and  thus  are  not  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  \nThe  Project  is  not  designed  to  alleviate  traffic  congestion  since  congestion  is  generally  not  a \nconcern in Mongolia\u2019s road sector, except for Ulaanbaatar during the rush hours on workdays. \n \n\nTable A12.6: Average Travel Time by Vehicle Type \n(hours per vehicle per trip) \n\nItem \nCar \nJeep \nLight Truck \nMedium Truck \nHeavy Truck \nArticulated Truck \nLight Bus \nMedium Bus \nHeavy Bus \n\nAverage \n\nWithout Project \n12.4 \n12.4 \n13.0 \n13.0 \n14.1 \n15.6 \n12.6 \n13.1 \n14.1 \n13.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWith Project \n5.3 \n5.3 \n6.0 \n6.1 \n6.1 \n6.5 \n5.5 \n6.1 \n6.2 \n5.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTime Savings \n7.1 \n7.1 \n7.0 \n6.9 \n8.0 \n9.1 \n7.1 \n7.0 \n7.9 \n7.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSavings (%)  \n57.3 \n57.3 \n53.8 \n53.1 \n56.7 \n58.3 \n56.3 \n53.4 \n56.0 \n56.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n7  The  Project  will  significantly  improve  the  road  surface  roughness  between  Choyr  and  the  PRC  border  in  Zamyn-\n\nUud, with the reduction in its international roughness index value from the present 20\u221222 to 2\u22123. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nD. \n \n12. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken to identify the parameters to which the EIRR of the \nProject is sensitive. The results (Table A12.7) indicate that the EIRR of the Project exceeds the \ncutoff  level  of  12%,  except  when  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  capital  costs  increase  by  214%,  (ii)  road \nmaintenance costs increase by 1,139%, (iii) the surface roughness of the project road during the \ndry  season  increase  by  175%,  and  (iv)  traffic  growth  or  user  benefits  are  reduced  by  66%.  \nEven  when  diverted  traffic  is  reduced  by  100%,  the  cutoff  level  of  12%  will  not  be  reached. \nEliminating routine and periodic maintenance on the project road will cause deterioration of road \nconditions, which will significantly reduce user benefits because of increased VOC. An increase \nin  the  roughness  index  of  the  project  road  to  19.8  will  reduce  the  EIRR  to  12%.  A  high \nroughness  coefficient  can  only  be  experienced  if  the  project  road  is  not  maintained  for  a \nconsiderable  period  of  time.  This  is  unlikely  to  occur  because  appropriate  measures  are \nincluded  in  the  Project  to  ensure  that  adequate  funding  is  available  for  maintenance  of  the \nproject road. \n \n\nTable A12.7: Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSwitching Value (%)a \n\nRisk Analysis \n\n \n214 \n1,139 \n. \n \n \n66 \n175 \n66 \n\nEIRR (%) \n29.7  \n22.4  \n28.7  \n19.1  \n19.7  \n28.8  \n17.4  \n12.0  \n24.1  \n\nItem \nBase Case \nCapital Cost Increase by 50% \nMaintenance Cost Increase by 100% \nNormal Daily Traffic Decrease by 100% \nDiverted Traffic Decrease by 75% \nGenerated Traffic Decrease by 100% \nTraffic Growth Decrease by 50% \nDry Season Road Surface Roughness Decrease by 175% \nUser Benefits Decrease by 25% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \na  Factors applied to the best estimate for each cost/benefit item to reduce the EIRR to the 12% per annum threshold. \nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nRisk analysis examined the probability distribution of the estimated EIRR and NPV of the \nProject. Within the assumed range of parameter estimates, the probability that the EIRR of the \nProject or NPV of the Project is negative is 26%. The median EIRR of the Project is 14.7%, with \na  range  of  0.5%\u221231.5%,  and  the  medium  NPV  amounts  to  $22.7  million,  with  a  range  of \nnegative $110.9 million to $152.2 million. \n \nF. \n \n14. \nDistribution analysis was based on trade statistics and the data collected from interviews \nand surveys of passengers, freight companies, and customs officials. Two types of distribution \nanalysis  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  distribution  of  project  benefits:  (i)  among  regional \neconomies, and (ii) among various stakeholders within Mongolia. The results are summarized in \nTable  A12.8.  The  Project  will  result  in  total  net  project  benefits  of  $268.3  million,  comprising \n$235.7 million for Mongolia, $29.4 million for the PRC, and $3.2 million for Russia. Based on the \nproximity  and  established  traffic  patterns,  90%  and  10%  of  the  project  benefits  that  do  not \naccure  to  Mongolia  are  distributed  between  the  PRC  and  Russia,  respectively.  Mongolia  will \naccount for 87.8% of total project benefits, while the PRC and Russia are expected to receive \n11% and 1.2% of total benefits, respectively.  \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12   \n \n\n57\n\nThe  project  benefits  accruing  to  Mongolia  are  distributed  among  three  stakeholders: \n15. \npassengers,  freight  shippers,  and  government.

The Government\u2019s \npoverty standard reflects subsistence  living and is based on a fixed minimum income equivalent ranging from $0.56 \nper  day  in  western  Mongolia  to  $0.90  per  day  in  Ulaanbaatar,  the  nation\u2019s  capital.  Approximately  21.6%  of  the \npopulation  in  the  project  area  (Govisumber  and  Dornogovi  aimags)  live  below  the  poverty  line  according  to \ngovernment estimates. The Project will provide reliable all-weather access to the poor towns and help reduce poverty \nin  the  area  through  (i)  improved  links  to  domestic  and  world  markets;  (ii)  increased  quality,  quantity,  and  variety  of \ngoods;  (iii)  increased  job  and  income  opportunities;  (iv)  improved  market  information  and  infrastructure  for  sales, \nwarehousing, and distribution; (v) increased private sector investments; (vi) reduced transport time and cost of goods; \nand (vii) increased options for personal travel. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nPoverty Classification: Other \nPoverty  in  Mongolia  is  primarily  income-based,  with  a  high  incidence  of  transient  poverty\u2014those  who  live  near  the \npoverty  line. According to local government  data, about 21.6% of the people  in the villages  along the  alignment are \npoor,  of  whom  7%  are  very  poor.  People  living  in  transient  poverty  are  vulnerable  to  external  shocks,  as  they  have \nlimited savings, job skills, and social protection against job loss. The official unemployment rate for the project area is \nabout  18.4%  (Census  2002),  while  the  project  household  survey  indicated  an  unemployment  rate  of  over  25%.  The \ntransition  from  a  socialist  to  a  market  economy  caused  many  Mongolians  in  the  public  sector  and  state-owned \nenterprises to lose their jobs. Some have successfully made a transition to the private sector, but others have fallen \ninto poverty due to a lack of job opportunities. The cold weather conditions in the past years caused herders to lose \ntheir herds and migrate to the towns.  \n  \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  road  transport  infrastructure  needed  for  pro-poor  economic  growth.  Construction  of  the \nproject  road  and  the  components  of  cross-border  road  transport  facilitation,  road  safety,  and  area  development \nprovide a comprehensive approach to maximizing project benefits to people in the project area. The project road will \npromote  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  by  improving  economic  efficiency,  fostering  trade,  and  facilitating \nregional  cooperation.  Competition  with  the  existing  parallel  railway  will  contribute  to  reducing  passenger  and  freight \nprices.  Lower  transport  costs  will  help  lower  the  prices  of  daily  necessities  in  local  markets  and  enhance  income-\nearning opportunities.  \n \nConstruction  of  the  project  road  will  increase  local  expenditures,  jobs,  and  tax  revenues  that  could  be  used  for \nimproving  social  infrastructure  and  services.  The  area  development  component  comprises  (i)  construction  of  four \naccess  roads,  (ii)  training  local  laborers  for  road  construction  and  maintenance  jobs,  (iii)  establishment  of  a  pilot \nroadside station, and (iv) the continued stakeholder participation process that includes enhancing small business and \nskills  development.  By  supporting  local  area  development,  the  Project  will  promote  regionally  balanced  economic \ngrowth  and  social  development.  The  road  safety  improvement  component  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nawareness  and  prevention  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and \nhuman  trafficking  will  be  implemented  along  the  north-south  road  corridor  to  mitigate  potential  social  risks  and \nstrengthen the positive social and poverty reduction impacts of the Project. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder  analysis  during  project  preparation  helped  identify  the  key  project  stakeholders  and  their  interests. \nNumerous  consultation  meetings  were  held  with  government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  local \ncommunities, road construction and maintenance companies, and other external aid agencies. A household survey of \n3%  of  the  project  area  population  was  conducted  in  the  villages  along  the  project  road  alignment.  Stakeholder \nconsultations were useful in drawing lessons from previous projects: (i) a local training program on road construction \nwill  help  achieve  local  employment  targets;  and  (ii)  a  wide  right-of-way  along  the  project  road  will  help  prevent \nencroachment along the alignment and subsequent strip development and reduce traffic accidents. Consultation with \nlocal  governments  was  essential  to  reaching  agreement  on  the  road  alignment  and  the  need  for  access  roads. \nDiscussions  with  NGOs  confirmed  the  need  to  expand  the  traffic  safety  component  to  cover  the  entire  north-south \ncorridor, and to strengthen the human trafficking subcomponent of the TA. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nA  stakeholder  participation  process  is  included  in  the  area  development  component.  The  process  will  focus  on  (i) \ncontinued stakeholder meetings for project design and implementation; (ii) assistance in conducting training for road \nconstruction and maintenance, including good working conditions; (iii) enhanced small business skills and related job \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n\f \n60\n\nAppendix 13 \n\ncreation, especially for the poor; (iv) development of a pilot roadside station; (v) facilitation of the implementation of the \nroad  safety  improvement  component  among  traffic  police  officers  and  local  communities;  (vi)  involvement  of \nhouseholds interested in road maintenance; (vii) assistance with awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking; and (viii) community-based environmental enhancement and monitoring. Aimag and soum governments will \ncoordinate with the Department of Roads (DOR) during project implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTraditionally, Mongolia has been a patriarchal society with sharp gender division of responsibilities where women have \nplayed  a  subordinate  role.  During  the  socialist  period  (1921- 1990),  the  Government  was  committed  to  gender \nequality.  Women  had  equal  opportunity  for  education  and  gained  considerable  ground  in  employment and political \nparticipation.  As  Mongolia  moves  toward  a  market  economy,  women  begin  to  face  greater  difficulty  in  the  labor \nmarket,  at  home,  and  in  politics.  With  higher  education,  wives  achieve  a  higher  status  than  their  husbands.  The \nsituation lead to friction and instability in marriages. About 30% household heads are women.  \n \nA  gender  plan  is  not  necessary,  as  measures  to  promote  women\u2019s  participation  and  mitigate  potentially  negative \nimpacts  on  women  are  integrated  into  various  project  components  and  assurances.  Through  the  stakeholder \nparticipation process under the area development component, the needs  of women and other vulnerable groups will \nbe addressed. The Project will encourage women\u2019s participation in planning and developing the pilot roadside station. \nWomen  will  benefit  from  the  Project  and  will  have  equal  access  to  project-created  jobs  and  wages.  The  Project  will \ngenerate additional revenue, which can be used to improve social infrastructure and services.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n No \n\n \nE.

All  licensed  motorized  vehicles  will  be  able  to  use  the \nroad.  The  Project  will  reduce  travel  time  and  transport  costs, \nwith savings passed on to the users of road transport services \nand  reduced  prices  of  daily  necessities  for  local  consumers. \nThe Project will make road transport services more affordable \nto a greater portion of the population. \nThe Project will help reduce unemployment through job creation \nand  skills  development.  Local  laborers  will  be  trained  for  road \nconstruction and maintenance work. Poor households along the \nalignment  will  receive  priority  for  road  maintenance  jobs.  DOR \nwill  ensure  that  contractors  follow  labor  laws.  The  Mongolian \nProfessional  Inspectorate  will  monitor  labor  conditions  at \nconstruction camps. \nEthnic  minority  groups  comprise  about  3.5%  of  the  population \nin the project area. They do not face discrimination and are not \nconsidered  vulnerable.  The  Project  will  not  adversely  affect \nseminomadic  herders.  It  will  help  improve  the  viability  of  the \nlocal  livestock  industry  with  improved  access  to  markets  and \nincreases  in  domestic  and  regional  demands  for  livestock \nproducts. \nHIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking:  The Project will complete \nthe  north-south  corridor  to  link  Russia  and  the  PRC  via \nMongolia.  The  Project  could  contribute  to  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  TA  associated  with  the \nloan  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  and \nraise awareness and strengthen border control capacity against \nhuman  trafficking.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  distribute \ninformation on HIV/AIDS to workers. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 June 2004) \n", "Currency Unit\nMNT1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "togrog (MNT)\n", "$0.0009  \n", "MNT1,167\n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADT \nBME \nDBST \nDOR \nEIA \nEIRR \nFDI \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \nJFPR \nMOFE \nNGO \nNPV \nPIU \nPKM \nPPMS \nPRC \nPSC \nSDR \nSOE \nSTI \nTA \nTKM \nTPD \nUNESCAP \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \naverage daily traffic \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation \ndouble bituminous surface treatment \nDepartment of Roads \nenvironmental impact assessment  \neconomic internal rate of return \nforeign direct investment \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nMinistry of Finance and Economy \nnongovernment organization \nnet present value \nproject implementation unit \npassenger-kilometer \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject steering committee \nspecial drawing rights \nstatement of expenditures \nsexually transmitted infection \ntechnical assistance \nton-kilometer \nTraffic Police Department \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  comprising  H.
