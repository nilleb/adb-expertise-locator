An initial environmental examination (IEE) that includes an \nAssessment  IEE  for  a  sample  project  was  undertaken.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  was  prepared  to  guide \nsubproject  selection  and  environmental  assessment  during  project \nimplementation. The summary IEE is in Appendix 10. The sample IEE \nand EARP are in Supplementary Appendices B and E, respectively. \nProject Description  The Project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the national \nnetwork of provincial and secondary roads through (i) rehabilitation of \nabout  100  kilometers  of  rural  roads;  (ii)  road  maintenance \nimprovements,  including  development  and  implementation  of \nmanagement systems, assistance with implementation of a national \ntransport  fund,  and  participation  of  private  sector  contractors  and \ncommunities  in  routine  maintenance  and  labor-based  equipment \nsupported  methods;  and  (iii)  project  management  and  capacity \nbuilding. \nRationale  Solomon Islands is emerging from several years of conflict (1999\u2013\n2003), and is one of the least developed of the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific developing member countries. The country is \nranked second lowest among Pacific island countries in the United \nNations\u2019 Human Development Index, and is unlikely to meet most of \nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \n \nThe socioeconomic situation is characterized by high unemployment, \nespecially among the youth, and one of the highest population growth \nrates in the world. Combined with slow economic growth, this situation \nexacerbates poverty. Due to the conflict, real gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita has declined by about 35% since 1999 to about \n$500.  \n \nInvestment in the road network, which never has been adequate, has \ndeclined in recent years, leaving the sector badly underfunded. The \nroad  network  is  sparse,  and  does  not  reach  77%  of  the  rural \npopulation. The road network has been constructed with low design \nstandards and poor quality materials. As a result, only 20% of roads \nare estimated to be in good condition, with the remainder not passable \nby light vehicles.  ", "ii   \n \nAs a poorly developed and weakly performing nation, Solomon Islands \nfaces many challenges. The most pressing issues include (i) sustained \neconomic growth, (ii) increased employment and income-generation \nopportunities,  (iii)  an  improved  legal  and  institutional  framework  to \nmanage  and  administer  public  sector  responsibilities,  and  (iv) \nimproved  human  and  institutional  capacity.  Improvement  in  these \nareas is expected to reduce poverty. \n \nPro-poor economic growth, as well as improvements in social and \nhealth indicators, depends on revitalization and decentralization of the \nrural economy. Better transportation infrastructure and services are \nessential to removing barriers to market access and promote rural \nproduction. The Government recognizes the overarching importance of \ninfrastructure  to  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  society;  and  that \nimproving infrastructure, particularly transport, is critical to increasing \nagricultural productivity, fostering private sector development, reducing \npoverty,  promoting  investment  and  human  development,  and \nstrengthening public capacity to deliver services. \n \nIn  recognition  of  ADB\u2019s  long  experience  and  implementation  of \nongoing projects and technical assistance (TA) in Solomon Islands\u2019 \nroad  sector,  as  well  as  its  expertise  in  designing  and  monitoring \nsafeguards, the Government requested that ADB take the lead in the \nroad  sector.  Other  partners  agreed  through  a  well-established  aid \ncoordination process. \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update identifies the development \nof transportation infrastructure and services as one of the two main \nareas  for  ADB  assistance.  ADB  is  implementing  a  TA  to  address \ncross-sectoral infrastructure issues and technical capacity building in \nthe road sector. The Project, therefore, will focus on rehabilitation of \nphysical road infrastructure. As a post-conflict and heavily indebted \ncountry, Solomon Islands is eligible for grant financing from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF).  An  ADF  grant  will  leverage  significant \ncofinancing from bilateral partners. \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  is  expected  to  increase  economic  growth  and  reduce \npoverty in the project area by (i) improving the accessibility of rural \nresidents to markets, as well as economic and social services; (ii) \npromoting  private  sector-led  development;  (iii)  fostering  market \nformation, and facilitating domestic and international trade; and (iv) \ngenerating  income  and  job  opportunities.  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved road infrastructure for economic and social development. \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $16.85 million. \nPlan ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n     \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  0.35  2.08 \nGovernment of Australia  6.10  36.20 \nGovernment of New Zealand  9.75  57.86 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  0.65  3.86 \nTotal  16.85  100.00 \n \nGrant Amount and  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $0.35  million  from  the  ADF.

ADB will administer all cofinancing. The combined grant \nwill  finance  all  civil  works  costs  and  consulting  services.  The \nGovernment of Solomon Islands will provide $0.65 million to finance \nthe local costs of project administration. \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. The pre-rehabilitation \nArrangements  activities  of  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \ntendering, and awarding of contracts will start in September 2006. Civil \nworks are expected to begin in October 2007, physical completion by \n31 December 2010, and grant closing by 30 June 2011. \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure and Development \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project, including for ADB and Government-\nfinanced packages, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Major \ncivil  works  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Minor civil works for maintenance will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding, shopping, and community procurement \nprocedures. \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consulting services will be required for (i) \nengineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (ii) \nconstruction supervision; (iii) road maintenance procedures, including \nformulation  of  policies,  training,  and  supervision;  (iv)  project \nmanagement; (v) capacity building and institutional development, (vi) \nsocioeconomic monitoring and evaluation; (vii) financial auditing; and \n(viii)  community  participation  initiatives.  The  Project  will  fund  136 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 278 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. \n  Consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve the capacity of the road network to support \nBeneficiaries  rural  development,  spur  economic  growth,  and  reduce  poverty  by \nfacilitating access to markets, as well as economic and social services. \nMore  reliable  transport  services  will  increase  the  ability  of  rural \npopulations to market their produce and derive income from natural \nresources. Greater accessibility will increase health and educational \nachievement, and facilitate the participation of women and youth in \neconomic and social activities. The Project also will provide people in \nthe  project  area  with  immediate  income-generating  opportunities. \nDirect benefits will include lower cost of transport services, reduced \ntravel time, and more efficient road maintenance expenditures.  \n  Subprojects will be assessed based on their contribution to national \ndevelopment  objectives  and  priorities.  Selection  criteria  will  require \nsubprojects to be economically viable, with a target economic internal \nrate of return greater than 12%. Poverty and social analysis at the \nsubproject level will be gender-disaggregated, taking into account (i) \nthe differential project impacts and risks facing women, (ii) gender-\nspecific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii)  the  interests  and  capacities  of  women  to  contribute  to  road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  be  proactive  in \nensuring women\u2019s involvement in road rehabilitation and maintenance, \nHIV/AIDS prevention, and road safety activities of the Project. \nRisks and  The project design considers potential risks associated with project \nAssumptions  management and rehabilitation quality. The Project will establish a \nProject  Management  and  Capacity  Building  Unit  to  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to handle increased responsibilities. A team of \ninternational and domestic consultants will assist with implementation.  \n  Environmental  impacts  will  be  monitored  through  construction \nsupervision and mitigated at the rehabilitation stage in accordance with \nthe EMP.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Solomon Islands is a large Melanesian island country, with a land area of about 28,000 \nsquare kilometers, comprising six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds of \nislets and atolls. More than 80% of the population of 475,000 is rural, living in widely dispersed \nvillages of a few hundred persons. The country, especially in rural areas, lacks adequate \ninfrastructure and services. The Project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nnational road network to increase rural accessibility and promote development. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3.  Solomon Islands is a weakly performing country1 emerging from several years of conflict \n(1999\u20132003), and is one of the least developed of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific \ndeveloping member countries. In the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index, Solomon \nIslands ranks second lowest among Pacific island countries. The country is unlikely to meet \nmost  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  2015.  The  socioeconomic  situation  is \ncharacterized by high unemployment (about 75% of the population is not formally employed), \nespecially among the youth, and rapid population growth. The population growth rate of 2.9% is \namong the highest in the world. Combined with slow economic growth, the socioeconomic \nsituation exacerbates poverty. \n4.  The economy is based on primary commodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. \nJobs  are  limited,  with  only  about  a  quarter  of  the  population  formally  employed.  Income-\ngenerating opportunities are scarce in rural areas. During the conflict, real gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  per  capita  declined  by  35%  to  about  $500.  Since  2003,  GDP  growth  has \naveraged 4\u20135% per year. Still, the International Monetary Fund and Central Bank of Solomon \nIslands estimate that the economy will require another 20 years to return to the pre-conflict level \nof GDP per capita. \n5.  The road network is sparse, reaching only 23% of rural villages with about 20% of the \nnational population. About 60% of the network is on Guadalcanal and Malaita, which serve \nabout 90% of the traffic in the country. Sealed or graveled roads are confined to Guadalcanal \nand Malaita, which also have the only significant inland roads, and a segment of secondary road \nin Western Province. Other provinces have relatively short coastal segments of gravel or earth \nroads near provincial centers. The network has about 185 watercourse crossings, mostly small \nlog bridges with few steel or reinforced concrete structures. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n6.  Investment in the road network, which never has been adequate, has declined in recent \nyears, leaving the sector badly underfunded and deteriorating. Development partners have \nfunded most of the road construction, providing $81 million over the past 15 years. That is \nequivalent to about 18% of the Government\u2019s development budget in those years. Over the \nsame period, the Government invested about $9 million and committed an average of about \n$0.5 million per year in maintenance funding through the recurrent budget. External assistance \nis summarized in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n1 The term \u201cweakly performing country\u201d should be considered synonymous with \u201cfragile state\u201d, as used in the \ndocuments of other development partners active in the country. ", "2 \n7.  The road network has been constructed with poor design standards and materials. \nAbout 8% of national roads are sealed, about 61% are gravel surfaced, and the rest are \nearthen. Shoulders are nonexistent, and drainage is poorly constructed and maintained. Roads \nthroughout the country have deteriorated due to years of neglect and deferred maintenance. \nOnly about 20% of the roads in Solomon Islands are estimated to be in good or fair condition; \nthe remainder are so deteriorated that they are impassable by cars and light trucks, and need \nrehabilitation. Similarly, as bridges have exceeded their design life, only about 25% are in good \ncondition, with 30% needing minor repairs, 37% requiring major repairs, and 8% closed to \ntraffic. The condition of the network does not provide much rural accessibility or optimize road \nagency and road user costs, thus restricting the contribution of road transport to economic \ngrowth, poverty reduction, and social development.  \n8.  The  poor  condition  of  many  roads  has  lowered  travel  speeds,  increased  fuel \nconsumption,  and  raised  vehicle  operating  costs.  Rough  surfaces  also  have  reduced  the \neconomic lives of the vehicles and suppressed road transport demand. Outside Honiara, road \ntransport costs are estimated to be 25% higher, and travel speeds are approximately half what \nthey would be if the roads were in good condition. Road access for rural areas has declined \ndramatically due to severe deterioration, road closures, and collapsed bridges.  \n9.  Due to the sparse road network, the main form of transport in rural areas is by small boat \naround coastal areas. Road transport services are provided by small-scale private companies \nand informally by a few vehicle owner-operators using market trucks, tractors, and small vans. \nThere are no publicly operated transport services, nor is there regulation of passenger or freight \ncharges. Traffic volumes are very low outside of Honiara. \n10.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Development  (MID)  is  responsible  for  road \ndevelopment and maintenance. Maintenance funding has been inadequate, and works have \ntypically been carried out by MID\u2019s own forces. Opportunities for the private sector have been \nlimited and uneven, constraining its development. Before the conflict, MID maintained a large \nlabor force that was not always fully utilized. Staffing levels fell greatly during the conflict, and \nhave not been restored. MID has recognized the need to rebuild its skills in asset planning and \nmanagement, contract administration, and policy and strategy development. As a result, it is \nnow recruiting more professional staff and training them with ADB assistance.  \n1.  Government\u2019s Sector Strategy \n11.  The Government\u2019s development vision, priorities, and strategies are articulated in the \nNational  Economic  Recovery,  Reform,  and  Development  Plan  2003\u20132006  (NERRDP).2  It \nidentifies key strategic areas for revitalizing the productive sector and rebuilding infrastructure, \nand  for  restoring  basic  social  services  and  fostering  social  development.  The  NERRDP \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  transport  infrastructure  as  an  enabling  input  for  community \ndevelopment. The Government expects that implementation of the plan, with a preferential \nfocus  on  disadvantaged  and  rural  populations,  will  lead  to  more  equitable  distribution  of \nincreasing incomes, social services, and development among provinces, social groups, and \ngenders. All stakeholders agree that the NERRDP is the appropriate basis for prioritizing and \ncoordinating  sector  activities.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  take  the  lead  among \ndevelopment partners in coordinating assistance to the transport sector. \n                                                 \n2 Solomon Islands Government. 2003. National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan 2003\u20132006. \nHoniara. (A successor to this plan is being prepared.) ", "3 \n12.  The Transport Sector Strategy3 contains the national transport policies and strategies. It \nfocuses on (i) rehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges in Guadalcanal and Malaita; (ii) \nextending  similar  rehabilitation  to  other  provinces;  (iii)  strengthening  capacity  to  manage \nprojects,  contracts,  and  road  assets;  (iv)  promoting  the  participation  of  the  private  sector, \ncommunities, women, and youth groups for maintenance; and (v) establishing a dedicated \ntransport fund with sustainable revenues from user charges, fuel taxes, and vehicle fees.  \n \n13.  The Transport Sector Strategy will be implemented according to the National Transport \nPlan (NTP). The NTP provides the framework and action plan for developing and maintaining \nphysical infrastructure, facilitating transport services, improving the capacity of Government \nagencies,  and  enhancing  private  sector  participation  (Appendix  2).4  The  NTP,  which  was \nendorsed in May 2006 and will be updated every 5 years, is supported by a three-year rolling \nworks program that will be updated annually. An official Transport Task Force (TTF) including \nrepresentatives  of  Government,  transport  users,  and  transport  service  providers  has  been \nestablished to advise on key issues, development options, and prioritization. \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy and Program \n14.  Infrastructure investments are needed to support economic growth, employment, poverty \nreduction, and social development. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for 2006\u201320075 \nprioritizes two major areas for ADB assistance: transportation infrastructure and services, and \nan enabling business environment. It also identifies institutional capacity development as central \nto all activities. These three themes are complementary. \n15.  ADB is implementing the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project6 (PCERP) to \nrehabilitate roads and bridges on Guadalcanal and Malaita that were damaged during the \nconflict.  A  project  management  unit  operates  under  the  direction  of  a  project  steering \ncommittee, comprising representatives from the ministries responsible for finance, planning, \nnational unity, and provincial government, as well as the concerned sectoral ministries. Physical \nworks, which began in June 2005 and are about 30% complete, are scheduled for completion in \nFebruary 2007. A recent change of scope, cofinanced by the Government of Australia and the \nGovernment of New Zealand, enabled ADB to expand this project.  \n16.  To leverage scarce public sector resources and promote opportunities for the private \nsector, MID will decrease its direct provision of works to concentrate on policy development, \nregulation,  asset  management,  and  contract  administration.  ADB  is  providing  technical \nassistance (TA) for an institutional strengthening project (footnote 4) to support the transition. A \nNational Transport Plan, National Transport Fund and Transport Policy and Planning Unit are \nbeing  developed  and  used  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  development  partners  to  plan \ninterventions.  \n17.  In recognition of ADB\u2019s long experience in implementing projects and TA in the road \nsector in Solomon Islands, as well as its expertise in designing and monitoring safeguards, the \nGovernment requested and other partners agreed that ADB take the lead in coordinating aid to \nin the road sector. ADB\u2019s country program in transportation complements assistance underway \n                                                 \n3 Solomon Islands Government. 2002. Transport Sector Strategy.

The NTP is a key factor in coordination. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n18.  As  a  weakly  performing  country  emerging  from  several  years  of  conflict,  Solomon \nIslands is confronting many challenges and opportunities. The most pressing issues include (i) \nsustained economic growth, (ii) increased employment and income-generating opportunities, (iii) \nan improved institutional framework to manage and administer public sector responsibilities, and \n(iv) improved human and institutional capacity. Progress in these areas is expected to contribute \ndirectly to poverty reduction. A review of road sector activities, policies and institutions, capacity \nbuilding progress, and lessons learned is in Appendix 2. \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n19.  Employment and Income Generation. Falling commodity prices, deteriorating rural \ninfrastructure, lack of rural services and access to markets, and low-productivity traditional \ncultivation practices hamper rural agricultural development. Poor and expensive infrastructure \nfacilities and services, a weak legal and institutional business environment, poor business and \nbanking  services,  and  a  limited  market  constrain  the  development  of  the  private  sector. \nEmployment growth, therefore, is severely constrained. \n20.  Sector Investments, Operations, and Sustainability. Road sustainability is a major \nchallenge. Financial constraints, poor equipment maintenance, and geographical conditions \nhave contributed to poor maintenance for many years. As a result, many roads need to be \nrehabilitated. Development partners are assisting with the rehabilitation of some roads and \nbridges in areas most damaged by the conflict. Rehabilitating and maintaining the road network \nrequire  significant  investment.  However,  the  Government  has  not  budgeted  for  new \ninvestments,  and  cannot  borrow  due  to  its  high  debt  burden.  Therefore,  prioritizing  and \nsequencing to maximize the benefits are essential. Past efforts, which have focused on basic \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and emergency works, have been inadequate and costly. A shift \nfrom this reactive approach to a preventive asset management approach is needed to sustain \nthe network.   \n21.  Road Network Development. The Government has invested about $9 million from \ndomestic sources and $81 million from external resources in the road sector over the past two \ndecades.  However,  due  to  poor  design  and  construction  standards,  and  negligible  asset \nmanagement,  about  80%  of  the  road  network  is  no  longer  maintainable,  and  requires \nreconstruction or rehabilitation. Almost all national, provincial, and secondary roads require road \nrepairs  and  replacement  of  bridges,  reshaping  and  strengthening  of  pavement,  and \nimprovement to drainage. Village and farm roads also need improvement to distribute the \nbenefits to poor rural communities.   \n22.  Road Asset Funding and Maintenance. Road maintenance funding has averaged $0.5 \nmillion annually since 1990. However, funding fell by 80% to an average of $0.1 million during \nthe 1998\u20132002 conflict, resulting in widespread deterioration, and has remained significantly \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005. Implementation of Interisland Transport Reforms. Manila (TA 4588-SOL, approved in May 2005 for \n$495,000). \n8 ADB. 2004. Diagnostic Assessment of Interisland Transport. Manila. (TA 4527-SOL, approved in December 2004 \nfor $350,000). ", "5 \nbelow the level necessary to sustain current assets. The proportion of this funding that goes \ntoward  maintenance,  versus  public  sector  overhead  costs,  is  unclear  due  to  limited \naccountability. Maintaining the 20% of the road network that remains in good or fair condition \nwould cost an estimated $1.6 million annually, or three times the current allocation.  \n23.  Institutional Capacity. Institutional capacity constraints have hindered MID\u2019s ability to \ndevelop  and  implement  road  maintenance  policies.  Declining  public  sector  budgets,  poor \ntraining, and conflict-related impacts have resulted in an inadequate human resource base. \nManagerial, administrative, technical, and vocational skills are in short supply in all sectors of \nthe economy and public service. Public sector recruitment has been a particular bottleneck to \nprogress, with about 25% of established and budgeted positions unfilled. These problems are \nacute in the road sector. An ADB TA project (footnote 4) is providing training and professional \nsupport for road planning, project preparation and implementation, and asset management. The  \nprivate contracting industry has little capacity and capability to perform major road maintenance \nand rehabilitation. MID will explore opportunities for local contractors to work with international \ncontractors  to  develop  knowledge,  skills,  and  experience  on  major  contracts.  In  addition, \noutsourcing routine and minor periodic maintenance contracts to local contractors will help to \ndevelop the private sector, while strengthening MID\u2019s role in asset management. \n24.  Labor-based  Methods.  Interest  in  developing  effective  labor-based  equipment \nsupported (LBES) approaches for routine road maintenance is strong. Compared to traditional \nmethods, LBES technology increases the labor component, supported by small fleets of basic \nequipment.  It  is  intended  to  increase  the  participation  of  small-scale  private  sector  and \ncommunity groups, with the potential for rural employment and poverty reduction. Although \npromising, such projects have had mixed results in Solomon Islands. While an LBES project for \nrural roads9 on Malaita has shown some success, a subsequent LBES project10 in 2003 on \nGuadalcanal was not sustained due to poor routine maintenance. More recently, the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  Community  Sector  Project  on  Malaita  and \nGuadalcanal  successfully  uses  LBES  methods  for  some  aspects  of  rehabilitation.11  LBES \nprojects that have used performance-based contracts have been more successful than those \ndone by force account. LBES methods are described in detail in Supplementary Appendix F. \n25.  Lessons  Learned.  Most  projects  in  the  road  sector  have  used  force  account \nprocedures, with only a few done by contract. Projects lacked quality at entry and were built to \npoor standards, which made them unsustainable. Key institutional and policy issues were not \nresolved, including (i) inaction on overloaded logging trucks, (ii) shortfall in maintenance funding \nin favor of capital expenditure, and (iii) failure to institutionalize an effective asset management \nsystem.  More  recently,  PCERP  encountered  initial  delays  because  (i)  the  inexperienced \nexecuting agency (EA) required training in ADB\u2019s guidelines for selection of consultants, (ii) \nrecruitment of local staff was delayed, and (iii) conflict eventually required the suspension of the \nproject. Following the resumption and training, however, the project is now being implemented \nsmoothly. Successful implementation of LBES methods requires close attention to training, \nsupervision, and performance standards, as well as commitment to routine maintenance once \ninitial rehabilitation is completed. \n                                                 \n9  United Nations Development Program / International Labor Organization. 1990.

Although the road transport sector can contribute significantly to national development, it \nhas  underperformed  in  Solomon  Islands  due  to  neglect  and  poor  implementation.  Clear \nopportunities exist to improve performance and increase benefits through a comprehensive \napproach  involving  asset  management,  institutional  reform,  better  planning,  and  increased \ncapacity.  \n27.  Sector-Wide  Approach.  Ad  hoc  management  of  the  road  sector  has  led  to  poor \nprioritization,  opportunistic  investment  and  maintenance  decisions,  and  limited  asset \npreservation. The Government and its development partners agree that a sector-wide approach \nis needed in the medium term to improve national control and ownership through the NERRDP \nand NTP. Given the constrained circumstances and development goals, Government policies to \nlimit  new  investment  and  concentrate  on  asset  preservation,  increase  private  sector \nparticipation  to  concentrate  on  planning  and  management,  and  build  capacity  to  improve \nplanning  and  finance  decisions  are  appropriate.  The  Government  is  using  a  sector-wide \napproach successfully in education, and is developing a similar approach to health. Supported \nby the necessary institutional reforms in MID, this experience can be transferred to the road \nsector. The Project will begin to establish the capacity and procedures to operate a sector-wide \napproach. \n28.  Improved Infrastructure for Economic Development and Rural Employment. An \nimproved  and  sustainable  rural  road  network  can  enhance  rural  economic  development \nsignificantly. Rehabilitated roads will improve access and lower costs of transport, which will \nraise rural incomes and stimulate production and employment. Focusing on the rehabilitation of \nprovincial and secondary roads can ensure connectivity and lower costs of access to markets, \ntowns, and social facilities. Contracting road maintenance through LBES methods will generate \nincome for the rural population. \n29.  Development Planning and Finance. The Government is updating the NERRDP and \nits associated implementation plan, based on the NTP. From 2006, the Government will prepare \na unified development and recurrent budget to improve the link between investments and \nmaintenance.  Government  planning  and  financial  management  reforms  underway  at  the \nnational level will complement and strengthen similar reforms in the transport sector. \n30.  Institutional  Reform  and  MID  Capacity  Building.  MID\u2019s  transition  from  providing \nworks directly to focusing on planning and asset management will facilitate a more effective and \ntransparent use of limited resources, and promote private sector participation. Targeted capacity \nbuilding, as part of a package of comprehensive implementation assistance, is supporting and \naccelerating the transition. The Transport Policy and Planning Unit (TPPU), with oversight from \nthe TTF, coordinate complementary project and TA activities supported by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners.  \n31.  Labor-Based  Equipment  Supported  Maintenance  Methods.  Existing  roads  in \noperable condition and newly rehabilitated roads can be preserved through relatively simple \nroutine  maintenance.  LBES  methods,  which  can  extend  the  life  of  roads  and  minimize \nexpenditures, can be more sustainable than traditional methods in areas with adequate labor \nsupply but poor access to capital and equipment. When supported by appropriate maintenance \npolicies,  institutionalization  of  a  contracting  system  for  communities  and  private  sector \ncontractors,  skills  development,  and  supervision,  LBES  methods  generate  business \nopportunities and income for local communities. This increases their sense of ownership, and \nsupports stability and security. ", "7 \n32.  Community and Gender Participation. Communities have an obvious interest in good \nroads, which creates an opportunity to involve them actively in rehabilitation and maintenance. \nConsultations allow them to determine how they will contribute, and on what terms (e.g., by \ncontributing labor or aggregates). An LBES approach to road rehabilitation and maintenance \nallows  the  capacities  and  contributions  of  communities,  including  youth,  to  be  utilized \nproactively. A gender-aware approach to community liaison and consultations can ensure that \nthe perspectives and capabilities of women are taken into account, and that an appropriate \nparticipation strategy is devised.  \n3.  Rationale for the Project \n33.  Pro-poor economic growth and improvement in social and health indicators depend on \nthe revitalization and decentralization of the rural economy. The poor condition of roads is a \nconstraint to the movement of people and goods, and a disincentive to productive rural activity. \nImproved transportation infrastructure and services, which would provide reliable access to \ndomestic  and  international  markets  for  rural  produce  and  commodities,  are  critical  to  (i) \nrestarting  and  building  rural  economies,  (ii)  reducing  migration  of  people  in  search  of \nemployment, (iii) decreasing conflict between groups competing for limited opportunities, and \n(iv) restoring basic social services in rural areas. The focus on improving rural accessibility will \nenhance poverty reduction. \n34.  Most previous projects, representing more than 90% of road sector investment, have \nfocused on Guadalcanal and Malaita. The other seven provinces consistently have received \nless attention, and have been subject to more deferred maintenance. As a result, provincial and \nsecondary roads in these other rural provinces are so badly deteriorated that they can no longer \nbe maintained, and urgently need rehabilitation. The Government requested preparation of the \nProject with a preferential focus on addressing the urgent needs in the rest of the country. Final \nsubproject selection will be based on the priorities established in the NTP. \n35.  The Government has embarked on institutional reforms, with ADB assistance, to ensure \nits capacity to implement a sector project effectively. The policy framework in the Government\u2019s \nTransport  Sector  Strategy,  which  is  appropriate  to  the  country\u2019s  circumstances,  is  driving \ndevelopment of an operational action plan to implement the NTP. This plan also will optimize \nthe use of domestic and external resources to reduce constraints caused by road network \nconditions. With the comprehensive implementation assistance and capacity building under the \nProject, this process will create the necessary capacity to implement these plans, as well as \ncontribute to the Government\u2019s ability to meet the goals in the NERRDP.  \n36.  These considerations present opportunities to consolidate reform. Given the widespread \nneed  for  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  investment,  these  issues  must  be  addressed  in \nparallel  across  all  aspects  of  the  sector.  Eventually  a  sector-wide  approach  to  external \ndevelopment assistance based on domestic processes will promote effective planning and \nimplementation  of  works  in  the  long  term.  The  Project  will  help  Government  to  build  the \ninstitutional framework and capacity to implement such an approach effectively. \n37.  By instituting a participatory approach to planning and maintenance, the Project also will \nincrease community involvement, improve the responsiveness of the Government\u2019s sector plans \nto  community  needs,  and  stimulate  rural  economies  through  increased  productivity  and \nopportunities for occasional labor.  \n38.  The Project represents the direct implementation of ADB\u2019s strategy for Solomon Islands \nby  (i)  upgrading  and  preserving  transportation  infrastructure,  (ii)  facilitating  expanded \ntransportation services, (iii) improving the enabling environment for private sector development, \n ", "8 \nand (iv) providing opportunities for direct private sector and community participation. Further, \nthe  Project  will  guide  future  external  assistance  in  the  road  sector  through  better  aid \ncoordination  and  consistent  development  planning,  while  serving  as  a  basis  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s road sector investments. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n39.  The Project is expected to increase economic growth and reduce poverty in the project \narea.  It  will  (i)  improve  accessibility  to  economic  opportunities;  (ii)  promote  agricultural \ndevelopment; (iii) foster market access, and facilitate domestic and international trade; (iv) \ngenerate income and employment opportunities; and (v) improve access to public and social \nservices. The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Components and Outputs  \n40.  Component  A:  Road  Rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  finance  a  portion  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s expected road rehabilitation works over 5 years of the NTP. This will include \nabout 100 kilometers of roads, of which about 15% will be sealed roads and about 85% gravel \nroads,  and  about  40  watercourse  crossings  (bridges,  culverts,  and  wet  crossings).  Each \nsubproject will be prioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria \nin  Appendix  5.  A  systematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject \nappraisal,  covering  (i)  social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii) \nprocurement;  (iv)  implementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will \nprovide sufficient evidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in accordance \nwith the detail and quality required to enable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of the \nsubproject. No subproject categorized as category A, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) or ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), will be financed under the \nProject.  Implementation  will  incorporate  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  and  general \nhealth and safety activities, as appropriate.  \n41.  Component  B:  Road  Maintenance  Improvement.  This  component  addresses \ninstitutional,  financial,  management,  and  implementation  aspects  of  road  and  bridge \nmaintenance through three subcomponents. The Project will implement the steps to be taken by \nthe Government in strengthening asset management and financing. It also will provide annual \nmaintenance of rehabilitated roads during the Project by routine and LBES methods. Outputs \nunder this component will include:  \n(i)  sound and sustainable road maintenance policies and practices; \n(ii)  annual maintenance of rehabilitated roads;  \n(iii)  procedures established and tested for maintenance of provincial and secondary \nroads using conventional and LBES methods;  \n(iv)  an  efficient  bidding  and  contracting  system  for  engaging  private  sector \ncontractors and communities in maintenance, plus training and supervision; and  \n(v)  improved project appraisal, management, supervision, and monitoring in MID. \n42.  Subcomponent B1: Institutional and Management Systems. The Project will facilitate \nthe transition of MID to an asset management regime by (i) strengthening transport policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory frameworks; (ii) increasing private sector participation; (iii) providing \njob opportunities for communities; and (iv) enhancing performance of the asset management \norganization. A systematic approach to subproject prioritization will be established for appraisal, \nincluding economic, social, and environmental evaluation. Subsequent design, procurement, ", "9 \nimplementation, and monitoring procedures also will be established. MID staff will be trained in \nall these aspects to develop their capability. The TPPU, with oversight from the TTF, will \ncoordinate complementary project and TA activities supported by ADB and other development \npartners. The TTF was established to oversee improvement in efficiency and management of \nthe road network, including the prioritization of projects to support the productive sectors. These \ninitiatives, which began with an ongoing TA (footnote 4), will be supported by the Project. \n43.  Subcomponent  B2:  Financing. Most  routine  maintenance  will  be  funded  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s ordinary recurrent budget and the National Transport Fund (NTF). During the \ntransition period, while the Government is increasing its budget allocations, the Project will \nfinance routine maintenance on all rehabilitated roads. The Project also will help MID improve \nits financial management systems, provide training, and assist with implementation. \n44.  Subcomponent  B3:  Labor-Based  Equipment  Supported  Maintenance  Program \nSupport.  For  basic  maintenance  works,  the  Project  will  establish  an  LBES  maintenance \nprogram. Program development will involve a review of (i) previous attempts at LBES, labor-\nintensive,  and  modified  equipment-based  methods  in  Solomon  Islands  and  elsewhere;  (ii) \nhuman, management, and equipment resources; and (iii) cultural and social issues that might \ninfluence implementation. The program will (i) train contractors and community organizations; \n(ii) provide appropriate equipment; (iii) engage small contractors for routine maintenance;12 (iv) \nprovide supervision and training during implementation; (v) conduct a needs assessment for \nprivate equipment pools for lease or hire; and (vi) regularly monitor program effectiveness, \nincluding comparative quality and costs of works undertaken by the technologies involved, to \nrefine the program as appropriate. Following evaluation of the pilot program, maintenance \nfunding will be allocated for LBES and traditional methods as appropriate. A road maintenance \nspecialist will train contractors and community organizations.  \n45.  Component C: Project Management and Capacity Building. The project will provide \nproject management and capacity building through a project management and capacity building \nunit (PMCBU) that will plan, assess, design, manage, and implement the road, drainage, and \nbridge works projects under Component A. This unit also will provide the advisory assistance \nnecessary for Component B. \nC.  Special Features \n46.  ADB, AusAID, and the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) \njointly prepared the Project in one of the Pacific region\u2019s more fragile and least developed \nstates. This collaboration has yielded a number of special features that reflect the experiences, \nperspectives, and lessons learned by the Government and its development partners. This is \nreflected in the attention to sustainability through longer-term capacity building integrated with \nproject  management  activities,  improvements  to  maintenance  programs,  participatory \napproaches, and LBES activities. These aspects will be complemented by the promotion of \nprivate sector participation. \n47.  The integration of capacity building and institutional strengthening with the PMCBU \nconsultancy  services  creates  economies  of  scale  that  permit  extended  capacity  building \nactivities  during  the  5  years  of  project  implementation\u2014well  beyond  the  typical  TA \nimplementation periods of 1\u20132 years.13 In addition to the implementation assistance that will \n                                                 \n12 Contract packages of up to $50,000 are envisaged for the LBES establishment period under the Project. \nEquipment will be provided through additional packages. \n13 ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department reports in related sectors support longer-term capacity building efforts as \na means of improving capacity building success.  \n ", "10 \nensure the works are performed efficiently and effectively, subsequent development and training \nin appropriate road and bridge maintenance systems are included in capacity building efforts.  \n48.  Approximately 72 person-months of staff services from the Pacific Technical Assistance \nFacility will supplement the capacity building components of the implementation assistance. \nSpecialist services will include community development and consultation, transport planning and \neconomics, and asset management and maintenance. AusAID will provide and finance these \nservices through a parallel arrangement. \n49.  Participatory activities have had an important role in the preparation of the Project, \nespecially the development of the NTP and the associated action plan for road management \n(footnote 4). With the inclusion of community maintenance initiatives and the LBES pilot project, \nthe Project also builds upon lessons learned by other development partners, and expands on \nthem through a review of international experience with LBES approaches (footnote 11). Since \nprivate sector development, including private sector participation in the delivery of infrastructure, \nis a key feature of ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy,14 the Project will develop MID capacity to outsource \nits functions, and prepare the private sector to undertake road and highway operations and \nmaintenance.  NZAID\u2019s  strategies  to  promote  local  contractor  participation  in  contracting \noperations also are reflected in project procurement, as feasible under ADB guidelines. \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n50.  The Project is estimated to require an investment of $16.85 million. A detailed cost \nestimate is in Appendix 4.

The Government has requested a grant of $0.35 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development \nFund to help finance the Project. The Government of Australia will provide a grant of $6.10 \nmillion and the Government of New Zealand will provide a grant of $9.75 million. ADB will \nadminister all financing, which will finance all costs of civil works and consulting services. \nWithdrawals from the Grant Account will be made on the basis of 100% of eligible expenditures \nfor each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by the grant. The Government of \nSolomon Islands will provide $0.65 million to finance the local costs of project administration. \nThe detailed financing plan is in Appendix 4, and is summarized in Table 2.  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  0.35  2.08 \nGovernment of Australia  6.10  36.20 \nGovernment of New Zealand  9.75  57.86 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands  0.65  3.86 \n    Total  16.85  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n52.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MID. The Government\u2019s TTF15 will serve as \nthe project steering committee, overseeing and monitoring all aspects of project implementation, \nincluding (i) policy guidance and coordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study and selection, (iii) \nproject  progress  reports  and  other  project  documentation,  (iv)  annual  reports  on  road \nmaintenance budgets and activities, and (v) audited accounts and financial statements. The \nPMCBU,  directed  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  MID,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation. Given MID\u2019s limited technical staff resources, a consulting firm will be retained \nfor  these  services.16  A  professionally  qualified  civil  engineer  with  appropriate  road  project \nmanagement  experience  will  head  the  PMCBU,  supported  by  technical  specialists, \nadministrative staff, and accounting services. The PMCBU will be fully integrated with MID \nprofessional and technical staff as counterparts.  \n53.  The  PMCBU  will  (i)  conduct  subproject  feasibility  documentation,  design,  and \nsupervision; (ii) manage tendering processes; (iii) manage contracts; (iv) prepare withdrawal \napplications; (v) prepare project progress reports and a project completion report; (vi) maintain \nproject accounts and complete grant financial records for auditing; (vii) monitor the Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic impacts; (vii) train MID staff and build their project implementation capacity; and \n(viii) complete related project management activities, as necessary to implement the Project \nsuccessfully and comply with ADB policies and guidelines. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 8. \n                                                 \n15 The TTF is chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Planning and includes the Permanent \nSecretaries of the Departments of Infrastructure and Development, Provincial Development, and Finance and \nTreasury as members. The MID Transport Policy and Planning Unit acts as the TTF secretariat. The Governments \nof Australia and New Zealand are also members by invitation of Government in recognition of their key role. \n16 See Component C and the Special Features section for information on additional capacity building activities. \n ", "12 \n2.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. Recruitment of the PMCBU consultants, \ninitiated after appraisal, will be completed by September 2006. Other preparatory activities for \ninitial works will be completed by September 2007, including feasibility studies, detailed design, \ntender documentation, award of contract, and mobilization. Rehabilitation activities, which will \nbegin soon after mobilization in October 2007, will be completed by the end of 2010. The grant \nis scheduled to close by the end of June 2011. This time frame takes into account the wet \nseason and appropriate construction periods for remote locations. Capacity building and the \ncommunity awareness program will be undertaken over the entire project period (2006\u20132011). \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.   \n3.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement under the Project, including ADB and the Government-financed packages, \nwill follow ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines.17 Civil works will be divided into packages. One major \npackage will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) and four small packages \nwill  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding,  shopping,  or  community  procurement \nprocedures.  A  number  of  packages  for  maintenance  contracts,  to  be  determined  during \nimplementation,  will  also  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding,  shopping,  or \ncommunity procurement procedures. ICB procedures will be used for civil works contracts of \nmore than $1 million, while national competitive bidding will be used for civil works contracts up \nto $1,000,000 and shopping procedures for contracts up to $100,000. Community participation \ncontracts will not exceed $50,000. Equipment packages valued at less than $300,000 will be \nprocured using limited international bidding procedures. Goods and equipment valued up to \n$100,000 will be procured using the shopping method. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \nTechnical and financial qualifications of contractors will be reviewed in conjunction with the \nreview of the bid proposals. Contractors might be awarded more than one contract based on the \nleast-cost  combination  of  contracts.  Evaluation  of  ICB  contracts  will  include  a  margin  of \npreference for domestic contractors as specified in ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  Consulting services will be required to set up the PMCBU, which will handle (i) project \nmanagement; (ii) institutional strengthening and capacity building; and (iii) feasibility studies of \nsubprojects, detailed engineering design, and supervision. All items will be combined into a \nsingle consultancy. The Project will fund approximately 136 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 278 person-months of national consulting services, provided by a firm. \nSpecialist services to be recruited include road and bridge engineering, contract management, \nprocurement,  construction  management,  community  development,  asset  management, \nmaintenance, accounting, and transport planning. A provisional sum is included for recruitment \nof other technical specialists under the same consultancy, if needed.18 The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 8.  \n57.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  the  use  of \nconsultants.19 At the request of the Government, ADB will recruit the PMCBU consultants. Given \nthe  challenges  of  attracting  firms  to  weakly  performing  countries  and  remote  locations, \nengagement of consultants using ADB\u2019s quality-based selection method based on full technical \nproposals is justified.   \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2006.

The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe disbursement procedures will include direct payments and reimbursements. The PMCBU \nwill open and maintain a dedicated imprest account in a domestic bank. The maximum amount \nin the account will be 10% of the total grant or the equivalent to 6 months of expenditures, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  initial  amount  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \n$300,000 equivalent. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement \nof  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidation  of  imprest  account  expenses,  and  is  applicable  to \nindividual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Direct  payments  will  be \nencouraged for most civil works and consulting services. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  Reports. MID, with assistance from the PMCBU, will submit to ADB quarterly progress \nreports on preconstruction activities and construction of civil works, including (i) physical and \nfinancial  progress,  (ii)  status  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),20  (iii) \nenvironmental  management,  (iv)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  (v)  public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (vi)  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that will \ncover implementation details, costs and benefits, and any other information that ADB might \nrequire. The Government will provide annual reports on road maintenance budgets, activities, \nand  expenditures.  In  coordination  with  the  institutional  strengthening  TA  (footnote  4),  the \nGovernment will advise ADB on progress in approving and implementing road transport sector \npolicy initiatives, regulations, cost recovery, and legal reforms.  \n60.  Accounts and Audits. MID, with assistance from the PMCBU, will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts that will identify the goods and services financed from the grant, the \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of counterpart funds. The project accounts \nwill  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \npractices  that  will  follow  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  External  auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the accounts and annual financial statements annually. The audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the grant proceeds and compliance with \nthe financial covenants included in the grant and project agreements. The Government will \nprovide  ADB  with  the  annual  audited  financial  statements,  audited  project  accounts,  audit \nreports, management letters, and other related statements no later than 6 months after the end \nof each fiscal year throughout the implementation period.  \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n61.   MID and PMCBU will establish a project performance and monitoring system within 6 \nmonths of grant effectiveness. ADB and the Government, in consultation with the Project\u2019s \ndevelopment partners, will agree on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project \nperformance in achieving its goals and purposes. These indicators will be refined and monitored \nduring project implementation. Guidelines for baseline values for subprojects, data collection \nand analysis, and periods for future monitoring are in Appendix 11. The indicators will include \ndata  for  monitoring  economic  development,  transport  sector  performance,  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, environmental impacts, maintenance, and institutional development. Monitoring \nand evaluation will be based on gender disaggregated data for social and poverty impact \nindicators. The PMCBU will provide hands-on training to the domestic consultants and TPPU \n                                                 \n20 As indicated in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 9), neither land acquisition nor \nresettlement is expected to be necessary. \n ", "14 \nstaff on data collection, monitoring, and evaluation. This will allow monitoring to be maintained \nin the future. The PMCBU will monitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide \na final report within 6 months of the end of the contract period. \n8.  Project Review \n62.  ADB and the Government, with AusAID and NZAID invited to participate, will undertake \nregular review missions (approximately every 6 months) and a midterm review about 2 years \nafter  project  inception.  The  reviews  will  evaluate  in  detail  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and other relevant aspects of the Project (including institutional, administrative, \norganizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and \nfinancial assets) that might affect project performance, viability, and achievement of scheduled \ntargets. \n9.  Anticorruption \n63.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with the Government and \nthe EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, ADB-financed contracts for the Project shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe Project. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n64.  The  Project  will  benefit  directly  the  rural  population,  many  of  whom  are  poor  and \nextremely poor, through better access and decreased travel time to markets and social services. \nGovernment agencies and private sector companies that use the roads to deliver products and \nservices will benefit similarly. The estimated benefits to these groups, as well as other impacts, \nassumptions, and risks, are described in this section.   \nA.  Economic Impacts \n65.  Rehabilitated roads will improve accessibility for rural populations. Direct benefits will \ninclude  travel  time  savings,  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and  fuel  use,  and  reduced \npassenger  travel  and  freight  charges  (e.g.,  shifting  from  sea  transport  to  road  transport). \nRehabilitated roads are likely to generate more traffic, promote more agricultural production, \nand create local employment during their construction and maintenance. Rehabilitated roads \nalso will create greater access to social services, including education and health. Lower costs \nfor routine maintenance will allow the Government to maintain more of the network and extend \nsimilar benefits to a greater proportion of the rural population. \n66.  Economic benefits from transport cost savings will flow to the areas served. Benefits \nfrom lower freight transport costs will be divided between producers, consumers, and transport \noperators. Since market prices are unlikely to fall substantially, most such benefits probably will \naccrue to producers. Prices for goods imported to subproject areas might fall. \n67.  The  NTP  (footnote  4),  which  is  based  on  a  least-cost  approach  to  achieving \ndevelopment  objectives,  identifies  the  Government\u2019s  prioritized  list  of  potential  subprojects. \nEconomic evaluations of subprojects will be carried out using the principles of the World Bank\u2019s \nRoads Economic Decision Model, including economic internal rates of return and sensitivity \nanalyses. The evaluations will be required to demonstrate that subprojects are economically ", "15 \njustifiable, with economic internal rates of return of at least 12%. They also will be used to \nprioritize individual subprojects. Economic criteria are in Appendix 5. \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact  \n68.  The Project will reduce poverty by improving people\u2019s access to local and provincial \nmarkets, agricultural fields, water supplies, and firewood, thereby offering income generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the project. \nDuring implementation, employment will be created in construction and maintenance for civil \nworks.  Following  completion,  employment  opportunities  will  arise  for  routine  maintenance \nconduced through LBES and traditional methods. By reducing the cost and time of travel, \ninducing economic activities, and employing people directly, the Project will improve people\u2019s \nincomes and food security. \n69.  During the poverty and social analysis of the subprojects, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and non-poor will be assessed using secondary and field data. Distributional \nanalysis will not be needed unless the initial assessment is considered insufficient, and if the \nextra data collection and analysis required for distributional analysis is considered worthwhile. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9, while a social and poverty \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \nC.  Social Impacts \n70.  Positive social impacts potentially include improved access to education facilities, which \nwill help raise school enrolment and retention rates, and improved access to health services, \nwhich will promote more frequent use and facilitate rapid care during medical emergencies. \nOther social benefits include easier access to administrative and service centers, including \ncommunication facilities. \n71.  Potential adverse impacts include hazards to pedestrians, particularly from increased \nand faster traffic flows brought about by road rehabilitation. A higher risk of HIV/AIDS is another \npotential adverse impact, since the road transport sector is a vector for transmission. However, \nthese risks are small due to low population densities and short travel distances that do not \nrequire overnight stops by service providers or travelers.  \n72.  Gender Inclusive Development. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject level will \nbe gender disaggregated. It will take into account (i) the differential project impacts and risks \nfacing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \nThe  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the road safety activities.  \n73.  Public Health Issues. While the reported number of infections remains low, Solomon \nIslands is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Risk factors include the prevalence of sexually transmitted \ninfections, teenage pregnancy, gender inequality and violence against women, recent violent \nsocial  conflict,  and  cultural  and  religious  factors.  Transport  systems  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment are recognized internationally as a vector for HIV transmission. Several HIV/AIDS \nprevention and treatment programs and projects are active in the Pacific region and Solomon \nIslands.  HIV/AIDS education and prevention will be integrated into the Project through links to \ndomestic and externally funded projects and a regional ADB project (Supplementary Appendix \nG). Construction contractors will be required to provide their crew and communities access to \neducation and control programs. \n ", "16 \n74.  Stakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  Under  ADB  TA  (footnote  4),  MID  is \nconducting a series of population and/or accessibility field surveys along road corridors of \ninfluence (COI) that allow transport users\u2019 priorities and needs to be incorporated into the NTP. \nAs  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  subprojects,  extensive  consultations  will  be \nundertaken in each subproject location with (i) resource owners, (ii) households, (iii) the poor \nand non-poor, (iv) females and males, (v) young and old, (vi) the disabled, (vii) community-\nbased and nongovernment organizations, (viii) transport service providers and users, (ix) local \ncontractors,  and  (x)  provincial  and  subprovincial  governments.  The  TTF,  assisted  by  the \nPMCBU, is expected to establish local consultative groups, which will serve as the primary \ncontact point between the Project and communities in the COI on project-related matters, \nincluding recruitment of labor and access to aggregates. \n75.  Resettlement  Impacts.  The  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require \nresettlement or land acquisition, as all works will be undertaken on existing roads within existing \nrights-of-way. \n76.  Indigenous  People.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the \npopulation, are the indigenous people of Solomon Islands. For the indigenous population, the \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  improve  access  to  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social \nservices. The Project is not expected to have a negative impact on indigenous peoples that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.21  \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n77.  The Project is classified as environmental category B, as all road improvement activities \nwill be confined to existing rights-of-way, and neither land acquisition nor resettlement will be \nrequired. Field surveys of sample subprojects were conducted to help assess environmental \nimpacts of the Project. A summary initial environmental examination (IEE) of the sector project, \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines,22 is in Appendix 10. \nADB\u2019s  assessment  procedure  is  aligned  with  the  environmental  impact  assessment \nrequirements of the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1998). \n78.  An IEE has been conducted for a sample subproject to develop the methodology for \nenvironmental assessment of subprojects, as well as an environmental assessment review \nprocess (EARP). The sample subproject IEE findings support the classification of the Project as \ncategory B.  \n79.  Subproject environmental selection criteria will ensure that the Project will not harm any \necologically or culturally sensitive areas. The construction of improved drainage structures, \nstabilization of slopes through bioengineering, and other measures undertaken by the Project \nwill  have  long-term  beneficial  impacts  on  the  environment.  Short-term  impacts  will  be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts, \nsuch as loss of vegetation due to earth moving, and minor sedimentation of waterways and the \ncoastal environment near the shore. These impacts will end with the completion of rehabilitation \nworks, and methods specified in the environmental management plan (EMP) will mitigate them. \nAdherence to best engineering practices during rehabilitation, and strict enforcement of the \nEMP, will avoid or adequately mitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts.  \n80.  Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific EMP \nprepared under the responsibility of the PMCBU. The EMP will specify the required mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring activities to ensure their effectiveness.   \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n22 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. ", "17 \nE.  Policy and Institutional Improvements  \n81.  The  road  sector  institutional  development  component  supported  by  the  Project  will \nadvance the objectives of Government policy in improving the efficiency of public services \ndelivery. It also will create participation opportunities for the private sector contracting industry \nthrough performance-based maintenance contracts, as well as smaller LBES construction and \nrehabilitation packages.  \nF.  Project Risks and Safeguards  \n82.  The risks and safeguards related to the Project include:  \n(i)  Technical  risks.  Underestimation  of  resource  allocation  and  improper \nemployment of appropriate construction methods and equipment might cause \ndelays and increase costs. Limited availability of aggregates in some areas could \npose difficulties. The project design will mitigate these risks by (a) incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance in \nsimilar conditions; (b) requiring a minimum level for provision of physical plant at \nmobilization,  detailed  quantification  of  engineering  risks,  and  adequate \ncontingencies for unforeseen items; and (c) holding community consultations \nadvance, with Government support, on subproject selection and for access to \nresources. \n(ii)  Financial risks. Grant-financed budgetary allocations for the Project could be \ninadequate as a result of underestimated construction costs, more-than-routine \nsupervision of contractors, inflation during implementation, and the potential cost \nof defending construction claims lodged by contractors. To mitigate these risks, \nthe  PMCBU  will  (a)  use  conservative  cost  estimates,  (b)  prepare  some \nsubprojects for concurrent implementation to absorb additional funding in case of \nslower-than-forecasted  implementation,  (c)  use  strict  and  effective  contract \nconditions to mitigate slow contractor performance, (d) develop measures to \nmitigate uninsurable risks during preparation of the contract documentation to \nlimit the employer\u2019s exposure, and (e) require a guarantee by the contractor for \none  year  following  rehabilitation  to  ensure  construction  quality.  Government \nbudgetary allocations for restructuring, road maintenance, and counterpart staff \ncould  be  inadequate  due  to  poor  national  financial  management.  Ongoing \nprograms  supported  by  development  partners  are  strengthening  Government \nbudgetary processes, financial management systems, and provincial governance \nand will thus improve the environment for project implementation and institutional \ncapacity building. The Government is expected to increase recurrent budgets for \nmaintenance  progressively  to  protect  investments  in  road  infrastructure.  The \nongoing TA and capacity building under the Project will mitigate the internal \nfinancial risks associated with the need to improve its financial systems.  \n(iii)  Institutional reforms and sector restructuring risks. Progress in restructuring \nMID and developing its management systems to transform itself into a planning \nand asset management agency depends on successful ADB TA and adequate \nGovernment  funding.  One  risk  is  that  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the \nreform process, and associated development and implementation of operational \nand  management  procedures,  could  wane.  The  approach  also  relies  on  a \ndedicated  source  of  funding  for  road  maintenance  and  investment,  supplied \nthrough the NTF. Further risks include the Government not progressing with \ntimely legal and institutional reforms, and resource shortages within MID. The \n ", "18 \nproject design mitigates these risks through close collaboration and cooperation \nwith the ongoing TA, which involves consultations between Government, private \nsector,  and  public.  ADB  project  and  TA  review  missions,  as  well  country \nconsultation missions, will engage in regular dialogue to maintain support and \ncommitment. ADB also will continue to work closely with development partners to \npromote sector governance improvements. \n(iv)  Land and material acquisition risks. Landowners and rural populations are \nexpected  to  welcome  road  rehabilitation  for  social  and  economic  benefits. \nExisting practice in Solomon Islands is for local landowners to grant access for \naggregates  as  their  counterpart  contribution.  Clear  Government  and \ndevelopment partner policies regarding counterpart contributions mitigate the risk \nof demands for compensation.  \n(v)  Post-conflict environment risks. The post-conflict environment is stable, and \nthe  economy  has  recovered  substantially.  The  business  environment  is \nincreasingly  positive,  as  contractors  and  consultants  respond  to  business \nopportunities. If political instability increases or the peace and order situation \ndeteriorates,  prospective  bidders  might  have  less  interest  in  the  Project, \nincreasing  tender  prices.  This  also  could  reduce  community  support  for  the \nProject. Continuing assistance by development partners that is both large in \nscope and long term, to help the Government with its economic and post-conflict \nrecovery efforts, mitigates this risk. \n83.  An analysis of the project risks shows the economic benefits to be robust, and adverse \nsocial and environmental impacts not to be significant and capable of mitigation. Cost and \nimplementation risks will be managed carefully through the proposed approach to contractor \nprequalification,  contract  conditions,  financial  incentives,  and  penalties  to  avoid  the  late \nperformance problems of previous projects. Overall, the risks are sufficiently manageable to not \nconstitute barriers to project approval.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, Government has given the following assurances, \nwhich will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n(i)  Counterpart staffing and support. The Government will ensure counterpart \nstaff for the TPPU and Land Transport Division of MID are employed on a timely \nbasis  and  from  its  ordinary  budgetary  allocations,  and  ensure  that  MID  has \nadequate budget to maintain staffing and support its routine operations, including \nper diem and local transport for staff participating in field activities.   \n(ii)  Project  management.  Within  3  months  of  the  grant  effectiveness  date,  the \nGovernment, through MID, and assisted by ADB in consultant selection, will \nestablish the PMCBU and will provide office space, utilities, counterpart staff, and \ntelecommunications for the PMCBU. \n(iii)  Subproject  Selection.  Prior  to  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  the \nGovernment will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for \nfinancing under the Project, based on the agreed appraisal and selection criteria. \n(iv)  Road maintenance policy. The Government, assisted by PMCBU, will establish \nmaintenance policies for the road sector, including budget and implementation \narrangements, satisfactory to ADB, by December 2006. The Government will \nensure that its budget allocation for road maintenance is increased to at least ", "19 \n$1.6 million for fiscal year 2007, and increased by 20% per annum in each \nsubsequent year of the Project. Within 1 year of the grant effectiveness date, the \nGovernment will establish a special fund (described in the proposal as a National \nTransport  Fund,  or  equivalent)  to  ensure  availability  of  these  increased \nallocations. \n(v)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that all project \nrehabilitation works are undertaken within existing rights-of-way. In the event of \nany  unforeseen  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the  Government  will \ninform ADB and prepare a resettlement plan according to relevant laws and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The PMCBU \nwill ensure that no construction activities begin until ADB has reviewed and \napproved such resettlement plan. \n(vi)  Environment. No project assessed as Category A (significant adverse impacts) \nwill be approved under the Project. The Government, through the PMCBU, will \nensure  that  (a)  the  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  and  preliminary \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  are  reviewed  and  updated  at  the \nengineering design stage; (b) the Project complies with the EMP reflected in the \nupdated  IEE,  all  applicable  national  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and \nguidelines, and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); (c) the EMP is reflected as \npart  of  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (d)  any  adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from the Project are minimized by implementing \nthe agreed mitigating measures; and (e) environmental monitoring is done by \nPMCBU and contractors. \n(vii)  Gender  and  employment.  The  Government,  through  the  PMCBU,  will  (a) \nencourage project contractors to employ women in road rehabilitation and labor-\nintensive maintenance of selected national roads; (b) provide equal pay to men \nand  women  for  work  of  equal  type,  in  accordance  with  national  laws  and \ninternational treaty obligations; (c) provide safe working conditions for male and \nfemale workers; and (d) ensure that project contractors comply with applicable \nlabor laws, and abstain from child labor. Specific provisions to this effect will be \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents.  The  PMCBU  will  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring  the  employment  targets  for  women  by  reviewing  periodically  the \npayroll statements of the construction contractors, and will reflect progress in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n(viii)  Health risks. The Government, through the PMCBU, will ensure that all civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  participate  in  an  HIV/AIDS \nprevention program to be funded under the Project in construction campsites. In \naddition,  the  PMCBU  will  ensure  that  similar  information  on  the  risk  of \ntransmission  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases  is \ndisseminated to local communities in the corridor of influence, in coordination \nwith national agencies working on this issue. The PMCBU will include specific \nprovisions  to  this  effect  in  civil  works  contracts,  and  will  strictly  monitor \ncompliance. \n(ix)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 6 months of the grant \neffectiveness date, the EA shall finalize and adopt a project performance and \nmonitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  indicators  and  procedures \nagreed between the Government and ADB. The EA shall monitor the indicators \n ", "20 \naccording  to  the  agreed  framework  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  determine  the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the Project, and shall provide to ADB biannual \nmonitoring  reports  from  the  commencement  of  project  implementation  until \nproject completion, and thereafter on an annual basis for the first 5 years after \nproject completion. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n85.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the grant not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to Solomon Islands for the \nRoad Improvement (Sector) Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources upon \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement submitted to the Board herewith;  \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $6,100,000 \nto Solomon Islands for the Project to be provided by the Government of Australia; \nand  \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $9,750,000 \nto Solomon Islands for the Project to be provided by the Government of New \nZealand. \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n  President  \n \n17 July 2006 \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nEconomic growth and  \u2022 A 20% increase in job  \u2022 Development partners\u2019  \u2022 Sufficient political stability \npoverty reduction  opportunities in the  country reports \n\u2022 Continued external financial \nproject area by \n\u2022 Socioeconomic monitoring  and institutional support \ncompletion \nreports \n\u2022 Sound management of \n\u2022 A 20% increase in \n\u2022 Household income and  financial resources \nincome in the project \nexpenditure survey \narea by completion  \u2022 Sufficient incentives for rural \n  agriculture to expand in \nresponse to improved \n \ntransport \n      Risk \n      \u2022 Decline in commodity prices \nor access to international \nmarkets \nOutcome      Assumptions \n1.

Road Network \n1.  Solomon Islands has a road network of about 1,950 kilometers (km) spread over 30 \nislands. The network comprises 390 km of main roads, 455 km of secondary roads, 425 km of \nprovincial roads, 120 km of Honiara Town roads, and about 560 km of private and plantation \naccess roads. The country has an estimated 800 km of logging roads. The road network also \nhas about 185 bridges. Sea is the dominant mode of transport in Solomon Islands. The Ministry \nof Infrastructure and Development (MID) manages the main and secondary roads, while the \nprovincial governments manage the provincial roads.   \n2.  About 60% of the network is on Guadalcanal and Malaita, which serves about 90% of \nthe traffic in the country. About 1,570 km have a graveled surface and about 100 km of main \nroads, mostly on Guadalcanal and Malaita, and 30 km of Honiara Town roads are sealed. Other \nprovinces have relatively short coastal segments of gravel or earth roads around provincial \ncenters. Compared to other Pacific nations, the road density is low: Solomon Islands has less \nthan 0.07 km per square kilometer and only 0.005 km per capita. About 23% of villages are \naccessible by road (normally by cars or trucks), 32% by sea, 40% by walking tracks, and 5% by \nriver.   \n3.  The  main  roads  serve  the  densely  populated  areas  linking  the  main  centers  with \ncommercial centers, markets, and main ports.  The secondary roads are extensions to the main \nroad network, or serve provincial and subprovincial centers and rural communities on the main \nislands.  Provincial  roads  serve  a  similar  function  to  secondary  roads.  They  also  connect \nagricultural areas and villages to wharves, and provide access to social services, including \nschools, clinics, and markets.   \n4.  Main,  secondary,  and  provincial  roads  were  not  built  to  high  standards  and  have \nsuffered from years of neglect. As a result, the condition of the network is poor. It provides \ninadequate  rural  access,  thereby  constraining  economic  growth  and  development,  poverty \nreduction, and social development. In rural areas, the potential of agriculture production of cash \ncrops is underdeveloped primarily due to irregular farm-to-market access, which leaves much of \nthe rural population reliant on subsistence livelihoods. Resource-based industries also rely on a \nsuitable standard of roads for marketing their production for export. \n5.  About 80% of roads have deteriorated to such an extent that damage to vehicles is \nexcessive, and the roads are impassable by cars and light trucks. Roads surfaces are deformed \nand eroded, drainage is not working, and vegetation is overgrown. Many log bridges have \nexceeded their design life, with only about 25% remaining in good condition, 30% requiring \nminor repairs, 37% requiring major repairs, and 8% not open to traffic. The poor condition of \nmany  roads  has  lowered  traveling  speeds,  while  increasing  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle \noperating costs. The rough road surfaces also have reduced the economic lives of the vehicles, \nand suppressed road transport demand. \n6.  Development partners are assisting with rehabilitation road and bridge works in areas \nworst affected by several years of conflict (1999\u20132003), and with the restoration of some wharf \nfacilities throughout the country. However, much more needs to be done urgently. \nB.  Traffic Volume \n7.  Solomon Islands has approximately 11,000 vehicles, 90% of which are on Guadalcanal \n(75% in the capital Honiara), 8% in Malaita, 1% in Western, and the remaining 1% in other \nprovinces. Private cars, light trucks, and medium trucks (up to 8 tons, 2 axles) are the dominant \nvehicle types. Larger multi-axle and articulated trucks are rare except in Honiara and specific \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nmining and logging areas. The fleet of large trucks in Guadalcanal is forecast to increase \nconsiderably over the next few years with the development of mining and oil palm activities. This \nmight result in axle loads of up to 11 tons (dual-tired) and up to 8 tons on single-tired axles. \nAppropriate axle load legislation must be enforced. Motorcycles, motor scooters, and bicycles \nare not common in Solomon Islands.    \n8.  The primary cause of road deterioration in Solomon Islands is the high rainfall, combined \nwith poor road construction, poor drainage, and lack of maintenance. Maintenance of drains is \nessential in areas of high rainfall and in steep areas. Heavy axle loads, the primary cause of \nroad damage in other countries, are not common in Solomon Islands, except on a few mining \nand logging roads. However, with the increase in heavy vehicles in some areas, the amount of \ndamage is likely to increase unless roads are properly engineered and constructed for the \nhigher loads, and laws against overloaded vehicles are enforced. The weak institutional and \nabsorptive capacity of MID has made improvements more difficult. \nC.  Transport Services \n9.  The majority of vehicles in the Solomon Islands are privately owned. Privately owned \nminibuses  and  taxis  are  the  leading  form  of  public  road  transport  in  Solomon  Islands, \nparticularly in Honiara. Little public transport is available outside of Honiara. Public transport in \nrural areas generally takes the form of light trucks that combine goods and passenger services. \nWalking is the most common form of travel for distances up to 10 km. A few small and medium-\nsized private operators provide all the freight services. In Honiara, a few companies operate \nheavy and articulated trucks, and carry containers. In addition, private logging trucks provide \nservices to the forestry sector. Although fares are not regulated, market forces ensure they \nreflect operating costs. \nD.  Road Safety \n10.  Figures obtained from MID show that on average six people die in road accidents per \nyear (1996 through 2003). That equates to a rate of 5 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which is \nrelatively  low  by  international  standards.  The  low  average  speeds  and  low  total  distance \ntraveled appear to contribute to this low road toll. \nE.  Institutional Framework  \n11.  The institutional framework of MID, which has responsibility for road management, is \nevolving. The former Ministry of Transport, Works and Communications was transformed in \n2001 into MID, which was divided into two departments\u2014the Department of Infrastructure and \nDevelopment and the Department of Communications Aviation and Meteorology, each with its \nown  minister  and  permanent  secretary.  Department  of  Infrastructure  and  Development  is \nresponsible for the management and development of the national road network. The creation of \nthe Transport Policy and Planning Unit (TPPU) in 2005 clarified responsibility for transport policy \nand planning.  \n12.  An ADB technical assistance (TA) is reviewing the organizational structure of MID with \nthe objectives of (i) enhancing its effectiveness and efficiency in asset management of transport \nmodes, and (ii) meeting the overall needs of transportation service providers and users. This \nreview will include the role of the Mechanical and Workshops Division, which primarily services \nplant, equipment, and vehicles owned by the Government. However, little of the plant and \nequipment remains serviceable. The Mechanical and Workshops Division is most active in \ntesting the condition of privately owned vehicles (a certificate of roadworthiness is a prerequisite \nfor vehicle registration), and repairing and maintaining of government-owned vehicles. As these \nlatter activities relate to traffic regulation and safety, rather than to infrastructure, responsibility ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nfor  them  would  be  better  placed  within  the  Department  of  Communications  Aviation  and \nMeteorology under a road traffic division responsible for road safety issues, as well as road \ntraffic regulations and legislation. \n13.  Similarly, the responsibilities of the Marine Division and its organizational structure are \nassociated more with maritime operations than with infrastructure. Therefore, the transfer of this \ndivision  to  Department  of  Communications  Aviation  and  Meteorology  is  being  considered. \nConcurrently, responsibility for wharf maintenance and development then should be vested \novertly in the Land Transport Division of MID. This would make the combination of wharf \nmaintenance works with road network maintenance easier, leading to cost savings in planning, \nprogramming, implementation, and supervision. \n14.  TPPU is responsible for policy preparation, planning and programming of road and \nbridge works, and Land Transport Division for their design and implementation. The TA, in \nconsultation  with  MID,  is  reviewing  the  organizational  structures  of  the  TPPU  and  Land \nTransport Division, and will recommend changes. The existing structure of TPPU is considered \ninappropriate for its responsibilities as a policy and planning unit for all modes of transport \ninfrastructure. Similarly, the Land Transport Division\u2019s structure is not suited to implementing a \npolicy  of  outsourcing  maintenance  and  capital  works,  and  will  be  restructured  for  asset \nmanagement.  \n15.  Staffing  and  recruitment  have  been  problematic  in  MID,  which  has  been  seeking \nadditional staff and recently filled five positions. Further recruitment is planned in 2006 for both \ndivisions. On-the-job training in planning, programming, budgeting, and project management is \ncontinuing for the staff in these two divisions under ADB TA. MID must continue to seek \nadditional staff, and make full use of training offered by TA and under the proposed Project. \nF.  Government Vision and Strategy  \n16.  National  Development  Plan.  The  Government\u2019s  development  vision,  priorities,  and \ndevelopment  strategies  are  articulated  in  the  National  Economic  Recovery,  Reform  and \nDevelopment Plan 2003\u20132006 (NERRDP). The overall national development goal of NERRDP \nis to enhance and improve the quality of life and living standards of all the people in Solomon \nIslands. This goal is to be achieved by ensuring peace, harmony, and personal safety among \nthe people; increasing incomes and their equitable distribution; and increasing the availability of, \nand  improving  the  access  to,  social  service  for  everyone.  This  would  lead  to  equitable \ndistribution of development among all provinces and people within each province, social groups, \nand genders. Preferential attention would be given to the disadvantaged and marginalized \ngroups and communities, including expansion of development to rural areas. The immediate \nobjectives of NERRDP 2003\u20132006 are to (i) improve the security environment by restoring law \nand order and fostering peace, (ii) strengthen and improve governance institutions and good \ngovernance, (iii) achieve macroeconomic stability and income growth, (iv) restore basic social \nservices in health and education, and (v) reestablish the foundations for sustained economic \ngrowth and human development. \n17.  The realization of these objectives hinges on increasing personal mobility and removing \nconstraints to the transportation of goods between areas of production and markets. Improving \nsecurity requires ensuring that law enforcement officers and justice administrators can respond \nquickly to emerging threats to peace and law compliance, as and where they occur. Effective, \nefficient, and transparent governance in other areas of governmental administration similarly \nrequires improved access within outlying areas of the country. Economic growth, particularly in \nthe production and distribution of tradable goods, depends on adequate, reliable, affordable, \nand secure transportation. Basic health and education facilities, as and where they are being \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nprovided,  will  be  effective  only  if  complementary  transport  infrastructure  and  services  are \ndeveloped that are accessible by a higher proportion of the population. \n18.  Thus, the improvement of transport infrastructure is fundamental to the realization of the \nNERRDP objectives. Transport improvements have an indirect impact on social and economic \ndevelopment, and play a supporting role to the direct components of the NERRDP in other \nsectors. Therefore, transport improvement and development must be made in concert with other \ndevelopments.  \n19.  National Transport Policy. National transport policies and strategies are contained in \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. Policies will focus immediately on the rehabilitation of transport \ninfrastructure in areas of most need. In the longer term, the Government\u2019s road sector policy will \nbe  to  (i)  restore  the  network  of  roads  and  bridges  to  conditions  that  promote  economic \ndevelopment and enhance social welfare and security; (ii) extend the scope of the maintainable \nroad network in accordance with socioeconomic criteria; (iii) establish an effective and efficient \nmaintenance and asset management system, including sustainable funding; (iv) improve the \nsafety, quality, and reliability of transport services; (v) promote private sector consultation on \npolicies  and  works  planning  and  programming;  (vi)  promote  private  sector  participation  in \ncontracting and service provision; (vii) encourage appropriate community participation; and (viii) \nprotect  the  social  and  environmental  standards,  and  the  interests  of  the  socially  and \neconomically disadvantaged. \n20.  The Government\u2019s strategy is to reconstruct high-priority roads to design standards \nappropriate  to  the  traffic  and  topography.  Improvements  needed  include  repairs  and \nreplacement  of  bridges,  reshaping  and  strengthening  of  pavement,  and  improvement  to \ndrainage (additional culverts and cross drains). Feeder roads connecting village settlements and \nfarms with main roads also should be considered for improvement. The Government, through \ndevelopment partners, is (i) rehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges in Guadalcanal and \nMalaita; (ii) strengthening the capacity and capability of MID to undertake project management, \ncontract management, contract supervision, and road asset management under the TA; and (iii) \nestablishing a dedicated transport fund with sustainable revenues from user charges. \n21.  The  Government\u2019s  limited  domestic  resources  dictate  that  external  agencies  will \ncontinue to fund most sector development. Similarly, the low capacity and capability of the local \nconstruction industry requires a heavy dependence on international consultants to carry out the \nworks. Asset management capability is being enhanced, enabling follow-up maintenance works \nto be carried out effectively and efficiently.   \n22.  National Transport Plan. The Transport Sector Strategy will be implemented according \nto the National Transport Plan (NTP). The NTP provides the framework and action plan for \ndeveloping and maintaining physical infrastructure, facilitating transport services, improving the \ncapacity of Government agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. The NTP, which \nwill be updated every 5 years, is supported by a 3-year rolling work program, which will be \nupdated annually.  \n23.  A national Transport Task Force (TTF) has been established to assist and advise on key \nissues and development options. The TTF comprises representatives of Government agencies \nresponsible  for  social  and  economic  planning  and  development,  and  representatives  of \ntransport users and transport service providers. The TTF endorsed the NTP in June 2006. \n24.  A  key  element  of  the  NTP  is  its  assessment  of  the  priorities  for  rehabilitation, \nmaintenance, and investment in expansion of the national network across the three modes of \nland, sea, and air transport. This assessment is based on the practicality of providing access by \nthe different modes of transport available in rural areas. The NTP decision framework is based ", "  Appendix 2  27 \non assessments of (i) existing networks; (ii) technical feasibility of providing access by different \nmodes; (iii) positive and negative economic, social, and environmental impacts; and (v) the \nneed for connecting infrastructure. After identifying potential subprojects, they were prioritized \nbased  on  a  multicriteria  analysis  of  economic  benefits,  social  welfare  considerations, \nenvironmental impacts, and promotion of intercommunity peace and reconciliation. \n25.  The NTP contains detailed transport sector and subsector road maps for all modes of \ntransport,  as  well  as  time-based  action  plans  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation  and \ndevelopment. These plans detail actions required, assign responsibilities for implementation, \nand identify associated costs and proposed sources of funding. The methodology is based on a \nleast-cost life cycle analysis of prioritized subprojects, as well as a full analysis of the road \nsector\u2019s contribution to development objectives in various locations. Since the plan covers all \nmodes of transport, alternatives to road rehabilitation are considered in this prioritization. \n26.  The  NTP  also  covers  organizational  reforms  and  human  resource  development \nprograms to ensure capacity is in place during the planning period. The NTP is intended to \nembody sufficient flexibility to meet emerging needs, constraints, and opportunities. The NTP is \ndesigned to satisfy eligibility criteria associated with development partner programs. The NTP \nwill be reviewed and updated periodically, incorporating new Government polices. \n27.  Sector Finance and the National Transport Fund. The Government has invested \nabout $9.0 million of its own resources and $81 million in external assistance to develop the \nroad  sector  over  the  past  15  years  (Appendix  3).  Given  the  large  investment  needs  and \nconstrained public finances, the Government will continue to rely on external assistance for road \nrehabilitation and development. \n28.  About 80% of the road network requires reconstruction due to neglected maintenance. \nRoad maintenance funding has averaged $0.5 million since 1990, with a temporary drop of 80% \nto  an  average  of  $0.1  million  during  the  conflict  (1998\u20132002),  resulting  in  widespread \ndeterioration. Funding is significantly below the levels necessary to sustain current assets. What \nproportion goes toward maintenance, versus public sector overhead costs, is unclear due to \nlimited accountability. Maintaining the 20% of roads that remain in good or fair condition would \ncost an estimated $1.55 million annually\u2014three times the current allocation. The benefits of \nroad  rehabilitation  will  not  be  realized  unless  a  comprehensive  maintenance  program  is \nimplemented. \n29.   To  address  the  shortfall  in  maintenance  funding,  the  Government  is  setting  up  a \ndedicated National Transport Fund (NTF), supported by ADB TA. The NTF initially will be \ncapitalized  through  an  expected  contribution  of  about  $13  million  from  the  European \nCommission.  The  Government  then  will  make  increasing  annual  contributions,  intended  to \neventually match sector maintenance needs. The NTF also will raise revenue from road user \ncharges,  which  are  appropriate  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation.  The  anticipated \nmagnitude of the NTF will be sufficient to maintain all rehabilitated roads. \n30.  It has been proposed that an independent board, comprising a comprehensive range of \nstakeholders from the Government and the private sector, should manage the NTF based on \nsound business principles. If the proposal is accepted, the board would be required to report \ntransparently  on  its  current  activities  and  future  plans.  The  operations  of  the  NTF  will  be \ndesigned to ensure more needs-related funding, as well as a more reliable flow and better \ndeployment of funding. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nG.  Main Challenges and Issues \n31.  Given its involvement in road maintenance and rehabilitation, the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID) plans to bring in about $2.70 million of road construction \nand  maintenance  plant  and  equipment  in  2006.  Options  for  deployment  include  (i)  MID \nownership for direct use, although it has limited capacity to operate and maintain a plant; (ii) \nMID ownership for lease to private contractors to enhance opportunities for the private sector; \n(iii) provincial government ownership and use, though they also have limited capacity to operate \nand maintain; or (iv) some combination of these options. AusAID and MID are evaluating these \noptions in the context of sector planning.  \n32.  The Government faces a number of challenges regarding road transport infrastructure: \n(i) resolving the scarcity and unreliability of budget allocations to the sector, (ii) recognizing that \nmaintenance  has  higher  priority  than  new  works,  and  (iii)  developing  asset  management \ncapability from planning to implementation. The major issues include (i) rehabilitating roads; (ii) \nmoving from a reactive to a preventive maintenance approach; (iii) increasing spending to \nmaintain the current road network; (iv) ensuring that road design recognizes life cycle costs; (v) \ninstituting sustainable arrangements for managing and maintaining roads; (vi) addressing social \nimpacts and community involvement; (vii) providing additional resources and skills for MID; and \n(viii) addressing the likelihood that, for many years, Government will be unable to borrow to \nfinance new investments due to its high debt.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR, 1990\u20132005 \nFunding  Loan or  Project Description  Amount \nAgency  TA No.  ($ million) \nADB  0704  Guadalcanal Road Improvement Projecta 6.50\n  1823  Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Projectb 18.50\n  4494  Institutional Strengthening of Ministry of Infrastructure  0.70\nand Development \nAusAID  Grant  Mataniko and Phoha Bridges  2.00\n  Grant  Community Sector Project  1.00\nEED  Grant  Sasamunga-Papara Road Rehabilitation Project  0.25\nEU  Grant  Transport Sector Strategy  0.45\n  Grant  Choiseul Road Improvement Project  0.30\n  Grant  Structural Adjustment Program for MID  0.80\n  Grant  Makira Road Improvement Project  0.15\n  Grant  Malaita Road Maintenance Project  0.10\n  Grant  Malaita Rural Infrastructure Project  7.00\n  Grant  Solomon Islands Rural Transport Project  4.00\n  Grant  Cyclone Nina Emergency Rehabilitation Project  1.00\nJapan  Grant  Lunnga Bridge   5.82\n  Grant  Metapono & Alligator Bridges   6.72\n  Grant  White River, Bonege & Tanaeba Bridges  7.45\n  Grant  Community Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project  0.50\n  Grant  Labor-Based Road Maintenance Projectc 0.46\n  Loan  Honiara Main Road Upgrading Project I  7.50\nKFAED  Loan  Honiara Main Road Upgrading Project IId 9.23\nTaipei,China  Grant  Weathercoast Road Improvement Project  0.20\n  Grant  Noro-Munda Road Rehabilitation Project  0.10\n  Grant  Gizo Road Upgrading Project  0.30\nTotal      81.03\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, EED = Evangelischer \nEntwicklungsdienst, EU = European Union, KFAED = Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, TA = technical \nassistance, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme. \na Amount includes cofinancing loans from International Development Association of World Bank ($2.0 million), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development ($1.5 million), and Government \nof Solomon Islands ($1.0 million). \nb Amount includes cofinancing grants from the governments of Australia and New Zealand in the amounts of $2.0 \nmillion and $6.5 million, respectively. \nc  Financed by Japan and executed by UNDP via subcontract with the International Labor Organization. \nd Amount includes cofinancing loans from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International \nDevelopment ($1.73 million), and Government of Solomon Islands $1.20 million. \nSource: Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Government of Solomon Islands. \n ", " \n3\n0\n \n \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN    \n \n \n($ \u2018000)    \nA\np\np\nCost  Financing  e\nn\n              dix\nItem     ADB  Australia  New Zealand Government   4\n \n               \nA.

Project Roads \n1.  The Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project will rehabilitate about 100 kilometers of \nprovincial and secondary roads, representing a 5-year time slice of the rehabilitation projects in \nthe Government\u2019s National Transport Plan (NTP). Subprojects will be selected based on agreed \neligibility criteria (section B).  \n2.  Roads to be rehabilitated are mostly gravel and earthen roads, with a small proportion \nthat are sealed, which have deteriorated to such an extent that patching is ineffective and \nuneconomical to restore the surfaces and contours to an acceptable quality and maintainable \ncondition. Such pavements require surface reconstruction and strengthening to handle future \ntraffic. Some new surface sealing might be required in areas of high erosion potential, such as \nsteep slopes. Rehabilitation subprojects will be subject to investigation and design criteria, \nthough a range of engineering solutions will be considered. Rehabilitation works also might \ninclude minor upgrading and safety improvements. \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria  \n3.  Subprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n(i)  The subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads assessed as high development \npriorities based on their contribution to the objectives of the National Economic \nRecovery, Reform, and Development Plan, particularly: \n(a)  improved  accessibility  to  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds,  including  schools,  health  facilities,  and  Government \nextension services; \n(b)  increased opportunities for employment and income generation among \npoor and rural households; \n(c)  potential  for  increased  private  sector  participation  in  provincial  and \nnational economic activities; \n(d)  potential to catalyze development in remote areas with poor access; and  \n(e)  contribution to poverty reduction among poor and rural households. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  endorse  the  subprojects  through  their  inclusion  and \nprioritization in the NTP. \n4.  Subprojects will be economically viable, and will demonstrate an economic internal rate \nof return of at least 12%. An economic analysis will be conducted in accordance with Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) guidelines for the economic analysis of projects.1 In addition to the \nstandard parameters of road sector analysis,2 the subproject will be assessed on quantitative \ngrounds for its contribution to \n(i)  potential for increased agriculture due to lower freight costs and more reliable \naccess; \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

Environmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects. No subproject classified \nas Category A in accordance with ADB's environmental assessment guidelines,3 will be eligible \nfor  funding  under  the  Project.  In  selecting  subproject  sites,  including  extraction  sites  for \nmaterials to be imported to the road construction sites, the following environmental criteria will \nbe used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, \nthen the subproject will not be accepted as part of the Project: \n(i)    roads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \nCategory A, requiring the production of an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) \n(ii)  requirement for major re-alignment of the existing road; \n(ii)    significant loss of natural/primary forest; \n(iii)  significant loss or damage to near-shore marine environments, such as reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(iv)  permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n(v)  permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n6.  Screening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects. No subproject that would entail involuntary resettlement, according to ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement,4 will be eligible for funding under the Project.5\n \nC.  Subproject Assessment Process \n7.  Potential  subprojects  are  identified  and  prioritized  in  the  NTP  based  on  high-level \nassessments of (i) existing networks; (ii) technical feasibility of providing access by alternative \nmodes; (iii) positive and negative economic, social, and environmental impacts; and (v) the \nneed for connecting infrastructure (Appendix 2).  \n8.  The Executing Agency, assisted by the Project Management and Capacity Building Unit \n(PMCBU), will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject based on the criteria \ndescribed in Section B. Each assessment will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to \ndetermine the detailed feasibility and impacts expected, using generally accepted transport \nplanning methods. Community consultations will be conducted to (i) validate baseline data; (ii) \nidentify positive and negative impacts; and (iii) evaluate technical, social, and environmental \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2003.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in  Is the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \nContribution of the sector and/or subsector to poverty reduction in Solomon Islands:  \nDue to several years of conflict (1999\u20132003), real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita declined by \n35% to about $500. Since 2003, GDP growth has averaged 4\u20135%. Based on projected economic and \npopulation growth rates, the International Monetary Fund and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands \nestimate that the economy will require another 20 years to return to the pre-conflict level of GDP per \ncapita. The distribution of national income is highly uneven between Honiara and provincial centers and \nrural villages; between rich and poor; and between women and men. Solomon Islands, one of the least \ndeveloped among the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific developing member countries, ranks \nsecond lowest among Pacific island countries in the United Nations\u2019 Human Development Index. The \ncountry is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \nThe socioeconomic situation is characterized by high unemployment, especially among the youth, and \nrapid population growth. The annual population growth rate of 2.9% is among the highest in the world. \nCombined with slow economic growth, this situation exacerbates poverty. The economy is based on \nprimary commodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Jobs are in short supply everywhere, with little \nformal employment outside the capital of Honiara, and scarce income-generating opportunities in rural \nareas. Falling commodity prices, deteriorating rural infrastructure, lack of rural services and access to \nmarkets, and low-productivity traditional cultivation practices hamper rural agricultural development. Poor \nand expensive infrastructure facilities, lack of an appropriate legal and regulatory environment, poor \nbusiness and banking services, and a limited market constrain the development of the private sector. \nSolomon Islands has some of the worst education and health statistics in the Pacific, which are a legacy of \nweak public institutions, low public funding, and poor service delivery in these sectors. Poor transportation \ninfrastructure, including roads, also hampers access to education and health facilities and services.   \nThe Project\u2019s focus on the rehabilitation of provincial and secondary roads matches the Government \npriorities, as set out in the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan (NERRDP). The \nentire road network\u2014from feeder roads to national roads\u2014is quickly deteriorating and impassable at many \npoints. The network requires urgent improvements to maintain access of the rural population to markets \nand services. Two key objectives are (i) to ensure connections between rural production and markets; and \n(ii) to improve access to health, education, and other services. While contributing to the overarching goal \nof poverty reduction, the rehabilitation of rural roads should be complemented by a long-term strategy to \nensure connectivity between national, provincial, secondary, and rural feeder roads; and cost-effective \nmethods to ensure sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nPoverty analysis of the subproject will be combined with social analyses, given the overlap between these \nanalyses.  \nThe poverty and social analysis (PSA) will focus on the population in the corridors of influence (COI) in the \npotential subproject areas, as well as others who might be impacted directly or indirectly by the project \n(known as COI plus). The PSA will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will involve gathering and \nanalyzing secondary data on the population living within the COIs, including information on poverty, \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nhuman development, livelihoods, and accessibility of social services. Sources of preliminary secondary \ndata include the 1997 census, United Nations Development Program Provincial Development Profiles, the \n2002 Solomon Islands Human Development Report, and the forthcoming national Household Income and \nExpenditure Survey. More in-depth secondary data possibly may be obtained from pertinent ministries in \nHoniara.  \nSome subprojects could be screened out based on an analysis of secondary data. For example, a \npotential subproject could be removed from further consideration due to the small size of the COI plus \npopulation in relation to preliminary costing of road rehabilitation, relatively low poverty incidence, and/or \nthe lack of connectivity of the road to markets or social services.  \nThe second stage of the PSA will involve direct engagement with appropriate stakeholders within the \nprovinces of the potential subprojects, and field-level impact assessment with representative communities \nalong the COI. The impact assessment will involve a combination of key informant interviews and focus \ngroup discussions with a range of stakeholders and social groups (these groups will be identified as part of \nthe process), including poor and non-poor, males and females, young and old, the disabled, and transport \nproviders.  \nThe purpose of the PSA of the Project is to (i) assess project impacts and risks, (ii) mitigate and manage \nthe adverse impacts, and (iii) assess the interest and capacity of stakeholder and social groups to \ncontribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \nThe potential poverty and social impacts of road rehabilitation stem from the improvement of people\u2019s \naccess to (i) local markets and provincial markets; (ii) basic and higher-level education and health facilities \nand services; (iii) administrative and service centers; and (iv) agricultural fields, water supplies, and \nfirewood. Road rehabilitation and maintenance activities also directly provide jobs for local groups and \nindividuals. \nThe potential economic benefits of road rehabilitation can be measured in terms of: \n(i)  time savings from switching to motorized road transport from walking or boats, \n(ii)  passenger and freight cost savings, \n(iii)  vehicle operating cost savings, \n(iv)  generated traffic, \n(v)  induced agricultural production and tourism, and \n(vi)  wages paid to local labor for road rehabilitation and maintenance activities. \nThe proportion of potential economic benefits that accrue to the poor and non-poor can be calculated \nthrough distributional analysis. However, determining whether the additional data collection and analysis \ninvolved is justified will depend in part upon the findings of the initial qualitative poverty analysis. A \nqualitative assessment of the degree to which the poor and non-poor are benefiting economically through \nthe channels outlined above might be sufficient.  \nOther benefits of the Project might include a more educated and healthy population. However, further data \nand analysis needs aside, these are merit goods in their own right, and cannot be captured fully in the \neconomic analysis. Measuring the increase in school attendance and use of health services resulting from \nroad rehabilitation will be sufficient. All impacts should be disaggregated by income and gender, as much \nas possible. \nAlthough this should not be assumed, the rehabilitation of a road might bring about simultaneously all the \nabove-mentioned benefits. The relative importance attached to different beneficial impacts should reflect \nthe priorities of communities in the COIs, as determined through the poverty and social impact, and \npriorities established by Government planning processes.  \nPotential adverse impacts include the hazard to pedestrians, particularly from increased and faster traffic \nbrought about by road rehabilitation. A higher risk of HIV/AIDS is another potential adverse impact, since \nthe road transport sector is a vector for transmission. Road safety and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nwill be built into the Project to help mitigate these risks.  \nLand holds tambu (sacred) sites and monuments that represent the history of people\u2019s clans, lineage, and \nsociety. Because of these historical ties, land becomes an important link between the living and their \nancestors. Politically, land binds people together as a landowning group. It is a source of political and \neconomic power, and is fundamental to Solomon Islanders\u2019 identity. Land is under customary tenure, with \nhouseholds often enjoying individual usufruct.   \nThe centrality of land to people\u2019s identity implies that the Project needs to work closely and sensitively with \nresource owners to avoid misunderstandings and gain their cooperation. Road rehabilitation work will \nentail gaining access to, and the use of, aggregates on customary land. It also might involve minor road \nrealignments, or the reclaiming of the fringes of remnant roads over which de facto property rights have \ndeveloped. Therefore, the Project must establish a credible liaison scheme with communities in the COIs \nfor discussing these issues and gaining resource owners\u2019 oral and written consent. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \nA national transport task force (TTF), comprising representatives of Government, transport users, and \ntransport service providers, is being established to advise on key issues, development options, and \nprioritization. These same stakeholders also will have opportunity to provide inputs and comments during \nthe development of the National Transport Plan, which is being led by the Ministry of Infrastructure and \nDevelopment (MID). Under ADB\u2019s Institutional Strengthening of MID technical assistance, systems are \nbeing established in MID for undertaking a series of population and/or accessibility field surveys along \nCOIs beginning in 2006. These surveys will provide another avenue for transport users\u2019 to incorporate \ntheir priorities and needs into the road sector planning framework. \nDuring the poverty and social analysis, stakeholders will be identified in each subproject location. The \nfocus will be on those who live with, or service, the COIs. Stakeholders to be consulted will include \nresource owners, urban and rural households and individuals, poor and non-poor, females and males, \nyoung and old, the disabled, community-based organizations, transport service providers and users, local \ncontractors, and provincial and sub-provincial governments. The stakeholder analysis will (i) identify \nstakeholders; (ii) assess their interests in the Project, as well as the potential impact of the Project on \nthese interests; (iii) assess the power of the stakeholders, and the importance of the stakeholders to \nproject success; and (iv) outline a stakeholder participation strategy.   \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \nA good relationship between the Project and community members and/or resource owners will be critical \nto its success. For each subproject, MID and the Project Management and Capacity Building Unit will \nmaintain contact with communities in the COI on all project matters, including issues related to property \nrights,  access  to  and  use  of  aggregates,  and  the  recruitment  of  labor  from  communities  for  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance. The possibility of labor contracts with community groups (as well as \nindividuals), and with women, will be explored actively with communities. Some opportunities also will exist \nfor interaction and consultation with local communities regarding HIV/AIDS and road safety issues. In \naddition, where the labor-based equipment support approach is intended to be used by the Project, \ncommunities will be involved actively in its design and implementation. Activities to build their capacities in \nroad rehabilitation and maintenance will be included.  \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAs the PSA will be gender-disaggregated, it will take into account the differential project impacts and risks \nfacing females, gender-specific measures to mitigate and/or manage these impacts, and the interests and \ncapacities of females to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. The Project will be proactive in \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \nensuring that women are involved in road rehabilitation and maintenance, HIV/AIDS prevention, and road \nsafety activities of the Project.  \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (IEE) provides information about the \ngeneral environmental settings of the Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project \nproposed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The summary IEE summarizes the findings of \nthe  IEE  regarding  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project,  their  magnitude  and  duration,  and \npotentially affected groups.  \n2.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  Project  has  been  undertaken  to  develop \nenvironmental screening criteria for subproject selection, and an environmental assessment and \nreview procedure for subproject assessment. A sample subproject on the island of Ghizo in \nWestern  Province  has  been  carried  out  to  assist  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  the \nProject. The sample subproject and the Project are classified as Category B under ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment guidelines.1 An environmental assessment and review procedure \n(EARP), which is in Supplementary Appendix E, will ensure that only subprojects that fall within \nthis category are included in the Project. \n3.  The Project will comply with the environmental provisions of ADB and the Government of \nSolomon Islands. The EARP follows the provisions of ADB\u2019s environment policy2 and guiding \nframework  (2003  and  later  revisions).  It  is  also  aligned  with  the  environmental  impact \nassessment process required under the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1988) and the National \nEnvironmental  Management  Strategy  (1993).  Mitigation  measures  are  prescribed  in  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  is  presented  in  detail  in  the  IEE  and  in  a \ngeneralized form as Table A10 to demonstrate the environmental management and monitoring \nrequirements of the Project. National law does not require formal approval of the summary IEE, \nIEE, EMP, or EARP. \nB.  Description of the Project \n4.  The proposed Project aims to rehabilitate provincial and secondary roads. The outcome \nwill be improved road infrastructure for economic and social development. Project activities \ninclude (i) rehabilitation and improvement of about 100 kilometers (km) of roads; (ii) labor-based \nequipment supported (LBES) road maintenance; (iii) sound and sustainable road maintenance \npolicies and practices; (iv) an efficient bidding and contracting system for engaging private \nsector contractors and communities in road maintenance; and (v) improved project appraisal, \nmanagement, supervision, and monitoring. \n5.  The subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads rated as high development priorities, \nbased  on  agreed  criteria.  No  subproject  categorized  as  Category  A,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy or ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (2005), shall be included as a \nsubproject. \n6.  Rehabilitation  works  will  entail  upgrading  of  existing  unsealed  rural  roads.  No \nrealignment or new road construction will be carried out. Construction activities will involve (i) \nvegetation removal immediately adjacent to the road, (ii) excavation and disposal of unsuitable \nmaterial from road shoulders and cuttings, (iii) placement and compaction of granular road \nbase, and (iv) reconstruction of bridges and culverts. Drains will be reconstructed along the road \nshoulders and diverted to suitable discharge points. They will be designed to minimize erosion \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n2 ADB. 2002. Environment Policy.

The upgrade works will require locally sourced sub-base and base materials \nfrom quarries and borrow pits suitably located to avoid adverse impacts. Some sections of road, \nsuch as along steep slopes and within towns, might be sealed with bitumen. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n7.  Physical Resources. Solomon Islands is an archipelago with a land area of about \n28,000 square kilometers in the southwest Pacific. The 992 islands extend 1,667 km southeast. \nSix major island groups make up 80% of the land area in two roughly parallel island chains. The \nnorthern group includes Choiseul, Isabel, and Malaita,  while the southern group has New \nGeorgia,  Guadalcanal,  and  Makira.  The  country  is  divided  into  nine  provinces:  Central, \nChoiseul, Guadalcanal, Isabel, Makira, Malaita, Renbel, Temoutu, and Western. \n8.  Many of the larger islands are rugged, heavily forested, and mountainous, while others \nare  low-lying  coral  atolls.  Topographically,  the  varied  and  rugged  terrain  supports  an \nextraordinary biodiversity and wide range of ecosystems. Most of the islands are of volcanic \norigin, surrounded by uplifted coral terraces and fringed by coral reefs. The soils found in \nSolomon Islands generally are well-drained and deep, though upland soils tend to be clay-rich \nand  poorly  drained.  On  moderate  and  steep  slopes,  the  soils  are  eroded  easily  where \nvegetation has been removed.   \n9.  Solomon Islands has a tropical climate with a relatively high and uniform temperature, \nhigh humidity, and abundant rainfall. The mean annual rainfall is 3\u20135 meters, though this varies \nconsiderably.  Heavy  rains  and  cyclones  generally  occur  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year. \nExtensive  rivers  and  perennial  streams  are  found  on  the  larger  islands  throughout  the \narchipelago. Rural communities obtain water primarily from streams, rivers, and springs, which \ncan be vulnerable to contamination. Many communities also harvest rainfall from building roofs \nfor drinking water. \n10.  Mitigation measures (such as terracing, construction of efficient drains, and planting to \nstabilize  slopes)  will  provide  long-term  beneficial  effects  by  reducing  soil  erosion  and \nsedimentation of surface waters. Construction of well-designed drainage systems capable of \nhandling the high intensity runoff characteristic of the region also will reduce localized flooding. \nWell-engineered slopes and drainage systems, combined with thorough planting, will reduce \nsignificantly the likelihood of landslides near the project roads. \n11.  Ecological Resources. Solomon Islands has a large number of terrestrial and marine \necosystems, many with exceptionally high biodiversity and endemism. About 80% of the country \nis covered with dense tropical rainforest. The rainforest is an important traditional resource for \nrural communities, providing food, building materials, and medicines. \n12.  Commercial forestry plays a central role in the economy of Solomon Islands by creating \njobs and generating revenue. However, when undertaken unsustainably, logging damages the \nenvironment with long-term irretrievable loss of resources. Soil erosion, contamination of water \nsupplies, loss of non-timber resources, and damage to coral reefs due to sedimentation are \nsome of the major impacts. The rate of extraction of logs has risen sharply over the past 5 \nyears. At current rates, natural forest resources are projected to be depleted before 2020.  \n13.  Fisheries  and  other  marine  resources  are  an  important  component  of  the  natural \nenvironment that the rural population heavily depends on. Up to 90% of the country\u2019s population \nrelies on fish and shellfish as a food source harvested largely from near-shore coral reefs, ", "Appendix 10  49 \nlagoons, mangrove swamps, and sea grass beds. The Solomon Islands coral reefs are mainly \nfringing and intermittent around all of the islands. The status of coral reefs in the Solomon \nIslands is relatively unknown, although the large increase in sediment runoff from logged areas \nprobably has impacted coral reefs and coastal fisheries severely in many places. \n14.  While  large,  formally  established  protected  areas  are  few,  many  smaller  sites  are \ninformally protected with the assistance from nongovernment organizations, resource owners, \nand community groups that that are being successfully managed. These include Kolombangara \n(Western  Province),  the  Bauro  Highlands  (Makira  Province),  and  the  East  Rennell  World \nHeritage site (Renbel Province).  \n15.  Social and Cultural Resources. The vast majority of the population of about 475,000 is \nMelanesian (95%), with the remainder being mostly of Polynesian origin. The population density \non some 347 islands is about 15 people per km2, one of the lowest in the Pacific. More than half \nof the population is below 15 years old. Malaita and Guadalcanal account for approximately half \nof the population. The next largest populated area is Western Province (65,000), with roughly \nequal numbers of people living in Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Central, and Temotu provinces. \nRenbel Province is the most sparsely populated. With an estimated annual growth rate of 2.9% \nover the past 5 years, the population is expected to nearly double by 2050.  \n16.  A prominent feature of the Solomon Islands is the widely dispersed rural population and \nthe many small villages, which are home to nearly 75% of the population. The country has an \nestimated 4,200 settlements with an average of 70 people in each and 6 people per household. \nThe relatively small population of internally diverse ethnic and linguistic groups dispersed over a \nlarge,  fragmented  land  area  of  mostly  rugged  terrain  with  a  limited  transportation  and \ncommunications infrastructure create conditions that hamper the delivery of basic services and \nrestrict economic growth. As a result, social and health indicators are among the worst in the \nPacific. \n17.  The Solomon Islands has been termed a \u201cdual economy,\u201d because the rural areas are \nlargely subsistence-based, while the few main population centers (e.g., Honiara) are cash-\nbased. The majority of the country\u2019s population depends almost solely on subsistence activities, \nsuch as vegetable gardening, hunting and/or gathering, and fishing. Gradually, subsistence \ngroups are becoming more dependent on earning cash\u2014largely from leasing customary lands \nto  logging  companies,  or  exchanging  goods  or  services\u2014which  can  be  used  to  purchase \nmanufactured goods and other items not obtainable from the immediate natural environment. \n18.  An  official  listing  of  sites  of  cultural,  historical,  or  archaeological  importance  is  not \navailable.  Within  the  subproject  areas,  the  EARP  will  identify  any  sites  of  clear  cultural \nsignificance, which will not be disturbed by the road rehabilitation. \nD.  Forecast of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n19.  The environmental impacts of the Project have been forecast using available national \ninformation and data from the sample subproject IEE. Screening of probable subprojects has \ndetermined that they are not likely to be located in or near protected areas, or in ecologically \nsensitive  areas,  and  that  environmental  impacts  will  be  minor.  However,  site-specific \nenvironmental  screening  of  each  subproject  through  the  IEE  process  will  confirm  the \nenvironmental effects and the impact categorization. The EARP (Supplementary Appendix E) \nwill preclude subprojects in or adjacent to sensitive habitats and ecosystems, or those that will \nproduce significant environmental impacts.  \n20.  Potential  adverse  environmental  effects  during  the  construction  of  subprojects,  with \ngeneric mitigation and monitoring measures, are described in the remainder of this section. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n21.  Soil Erosion and Sedimentation. The intense, high-frequency rainfall patterns in the \nSolomon Islands has the potential to affect temporarily downstream surface water catchments \nand  sensitive  near-shore  marine  environments  through  soil  erosion  and  associated \nsedimentation during road construction. Sediment contamination can harm downstream drinking \nwater supplies and freshwater ecosystems. Inland and coastal construction also can affect the \nnear-shore marine environment and sensitive reefs by generating a coastal sediment plume at \nriver mouths.  \n22.  The  main  sources  of  potential sediment  discharge  are  excavation  works  on  slopes \nabove and adjacent to rivers, and at the coastline. Subprojects in topographically steep terrain, \non the coast, or adjacent to waterways might risk erosion and slope instability during and after \nconstruction. \n23.  Simple and effective mitigation measures employing engineering best practices can \nensure that adverse effects associated with erosion and sedimentation are avoided. These risks \ncan be mitigated through (i) rapid replanting of vegetation, (ii) intercepting ditches above and \nbelow slopes, (iii) terracing or stepping slopes, (iv) flow dissipating structures in drains, and (v) \nrock lining drains where necessary. On coastal sections of road, the installation of sea walls or \nother  protective  measures  can  reduce  erosion.  Successful  avoidance  or  mitigation  of  soil \nerosion and sediment issues depends on careful planning before works start, as well as a daily \ninspection and maintenance schedule for mitigation works.   \n24.  The contractor should locate and be aware of drinking water sources downstream of \nroad  construction  activities.  Stringent  mitigation  measures  should  be  in  place  to  prevent \ncontamination  of  these  sources  from  sediment  or  any  hazardous  substances.  The  EMP \nspecifies that this activity should be undertaken before works begin. \n25.  Aggregate Extraction. Construction materials, such as sand, gravel, and borrow, will \nneed to be extracted from the surrounding areas. Aggregate extraction from quarries or borrow \npits potentially can cause adverse environmental and social effects. These extraction areas \nmust be selected carefully to avoid impacting sites with ecological or conservation significance.  \n26.  The Project Management and Capacity Building Unit (PMCBU) will develop aggregate \nextraction guidelines for the Project, which will encompass (i) negotiation and consultation with \nlandowners; (ii) the environmental effects of extraction (sedimentation, ecological disturbances, \nslope stability); (iii) site safety and public protection; and (iv) remediation of the extraction sites. \nSustainable extraction plans, which will have to be prepared during the IEE process, must \nadhere to a code of practice developed by MID for gravel abstraction. Aggregate sources will be \nagreed upon in close consultation with the local community. Aggregates may not be sourced \nfrom river beds, beaches, or reefs.  \n27.  Freshwater  and  Coastal  Water  Quality.  Localized  contamination  of  the  aquatic \nenvironment  by  hazardous  chemicals,  including  fuels,  bitumen,  and  lubricants  used  on \nconstruction sites and at encampments, has been identified as another potential risk. Fuel, oil, \nbitumen chemical storage facilities, as well as bitumen plants, will be positioned away from any \nwater body or drainage course. Further, they will on the inland side of coastal roads, and will not \nbe on beaches or immediately adjacent to the high water mark. Bulk storage facilities for fuel \nand bitumen will be surrounded by appropriate containment methods and a spill response plan \nwill be approved before works begin. Waste materials from construction sites and construction \ncamps will be removed and disposed of in areas that pose minimal risk of contaminating \nfreshwater and coastal environments. Further, these materials will be disposed of in manner \nthat poses no safety risk to the local rural population. ", "Appendix 10  51 \n28.  Hot mix bitumen plants, as well as the areas for loading, unloading, and discharging \naggregate materials, will be at least 30 meters from any waterway, drainage course, beach, or \nwetland.  The  plant  will  be  surrounded  by  appropriate  containment  methods  with  oil  traps \nconstructed to prevent the runoff of any contaminant into streams, wetlands, or the coast. Waste \nbitumen will be disposed of at a location approved by the PMCBU, and should be in an area at \nleast 500 meters from the coast or any waterway. \n29.  Before  works  begin,  drinking  water  sources  will  be  identified  along  the  road  route \nthrough the detailed IEE. Special care will be taken when working upstream of drinking water \nsupplies. Precautionary measures to warn local residents of potential contamination risks and to \nensure alternative sources are available, when necessary. \n30.  Private and Agricultural Lands. As the subprojects are upgrades of roads on the \nexisting alignments, permanent impacts on soil, vegetation, and land use are not foreseen. \nDuring construction, however, minor impacts on adjacent cultivated lands, plantations, roadside \ncrops, gardens, and residential properties might occur. In some areas, the often overgrown road \ncorridor will have to be cleared to accommodate shoulders and drains; and, in some cases, it \nwill be raised. Where the clearance of the road margin encroaches on land, landowners will be \nconsulted.  In  most  cases,  the  road  corridor  will  be  widened  only  to  its  original  width.  No \nhabitations are expected to lie on the existing right-of-way, and no involuntary relocation of \nresidents will be allowed under the Project. When the road is raised, effective drainage controls \nwill be incorporated into the design to prevent excessive runoff or flooding onto the surrounding \nland and in the vicinity of dwellings. \n31.  Negative impacts from drainage and sedimentation on roadside agricultural lands and \nresidential properties will be avoided by (i) locating spoil disposal and construction material \nstorage areas where they will not affect valuable land; (ii) controlling sediment discharge; (iii) \nutilizing cutoff drains and other sediment control measures, such as silt fences and grit traps; (v) \nusing effective storm water control measures; and (vi) careful design and location of culverts \nbased on local drainage regimes to prevent flooding and sedimentation. \n32.  Air  Quality  and  Noise  Effects.  Construction  might  affect  air  quality  due  to  the \ngeneration of dust, emissions from vehicles, and local emission of toxic gases and particulate \nmatter from bitumen plants (where sealing is to occur). These effects, however, are expected to \nbe short-lived, localized, and minor. Mitigation measures to reduce impacts on air quality and \npublic health will include (i) spraying water to suppress dust during construction, (ii) limiting the \nroad area that will be worked on at one time, and (iii) locating asphalt and crushing plants at a \nsufficient distance from dwellings or community facilities. \n33.  Higher noise levels are expected during construction. However, the impact will be limited \nto  within  about  100  meters  of  the  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  moderate.  Mitigation \nrequirements to minimize noise impacts include (i) placing stationary equipment at sites along \nuninhabited stretches; (ii) prohibiting construction during sensitive hours near residential areas \nand near schools during attendance hours; and (iii) keeping construction equipment in a good \nstate of repair. \n34.  Road  Safety.  Local  communities  will  use  the  subproject  roads  during  construction, \nwhich can pose a safety risk. This risk will be avoided by ensuring specific measures are \nundertaken, including timing the works to avoid periods when children are on the road, using \nclear signage, ensuring site safety staff are on duty at critical times, and providing road safety \neducation at the schools.  \n35.  Commercial  Forestry.  Improved  access  to  rural  areas  might  induce  damaging \nenvironmental activities, such as commercial logging. Logging operators could benefit from \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nrehabilitated roads in many indirect ways. However, a rehabilitated road is unlikely to contribute \nto opening up new forest areas for logging, because all project roads are pre-existing access \nroutes. Moreover, most logging operations construct their own roads and beach landings rather \nthan trucking logs along provincial roads. Heavy logging equipment might use the coastal \nsections of the rehabilitated roads, which could cause significant damage, particularly during \nwet weather. Provincial government authorities should agree on the use of the rehabilitated \nroads by logging companies. Further, new bridge structures should be designed carefully with \nweight and width limits to inhibit their use by heavy and potentially damaging logging vehicles \nand equipment. \nE.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n36.  Initial screening of potential subprojects has determined that they are unlikely to be \nlocated in or near protected areas, or in ecologically sensitive areas. Further screening in the \nIEE will establish whether proposed rehabilitation works might affect environmentally sensitive \nsites,  and  entail  the  loss  of  flora  or  fauna  with  conservation  significance.  Criteria  for  the \nselection  of  subprojects  will  preclude  those  in,  or  adjacent  to,  sensitive  habitats  and \necosystems. \n37.  In selecting subproject sites, including extraction sites for materials to be imported to the \nroad  construction  sites,  environmental  criteria  have  been  established  for  the  first  level  of \nscreening. If any of the following criteria are found applicable to the site, the subproject will not \nbe accepted as part of the Project: \n(i)    roads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \nCategory  A,  requiring  the  production  of  an  environmentalimpact  assessment \n(EIA) \n(ii)  requirement for major re-alignment of the existing road; \n(ii)    significant loss of natural/primary forest; \n(iii)  significant loss or damage to near-shore marine environments, such as reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(iv)  permanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n(v)  permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n38.  The IEE process to be applied will confirm these criteria, or recommend further work to \ncomplete  the  assessment.  The  preparation  of  the  IEE  document  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the EARP. All subprojects will require an IEE. \nF.  Institutional Requirements\u2014Environmental Management and Monitoring \n39.  The  PMCBU  will  administer  and  coordinate  daily  activities  and  overall  project \nimplementation. The PMCBU will assign a qualified staff member for environmental compliance \nto prepare subproject IEEs, outline EMPs, and provide training within the PMCBU team. The \nproject  manager  will  ensure  that  requirements  of  the  EMP  are  included  in  the  contract \ndocumentation, while the PMCBU will oversee and monitor the implementation of the EMP and \nEARP. \n40.  The Environment and Conservation Division (ECD) of the Ministry for the Environment of \nthe  Department  of  Forests,  Environment  and  Conservation  (DFEC)  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring  the  environmental  management  and  mitigation  requirements  of  the  Project  are \nundertaken to good standard. The ECD also will audit EMPs. TA provided through the PMCBU ", "Appendix 10  53 \nwill be available for participation by ECD to enable it to fulfill these functions, and to ensure that \nthe requirements of the Government\u2019s Environmental Act are implemented effectively. \n41.  The civil works contractor will be required to prepare and implement a detailed EMP at \nthe  construction  stage.  The  PMCBU  will  approve  the  plans  before  implementation.  The \ncontractor will undertake environmental monitoring under the supervision of the PMCBU.   \n42.  Environmental  Monitoring  Plan.  The  EMP  consists  of  mitigation,  monitoring,  and \ninstitutional  measures  to  be  taken  during  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the \nsubprojects to eliminate or reduce to acceptable levels any adverse environmental impact. A \nsummary of the EMP is in Table A10. \n43.  Subproject  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedure.  Supplementary \nAppendix  E  contains  the  EARP.  It  was  prepared  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy, and is consistent with the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1988) and the \nNational Environmental Management Strategy (1993).   \n44.  Reporting. A reporting system is a prerequisite for effective implementation of the EMP. \nDuring construction the PMCBU will provide quarterly reports to ADB on the implementation of \nthe EMP. The PMCBU is required to include a compliance status report, detailing environmental \nmitigation measures and monitoring. A designated PMCBU site engineer, who will be trained by \nthe  PMCBU  environmental  specialist,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  and \nreporting of the EMP. \n45.  Training.  To  ensure  the  success  of  the  proposed  institutional  and  environmental \nmanagement  arrangements,  training  and  skills  transfer  are  needed.  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough the training of local staff by the PMCBU environmental specialist in the supervision, \nreview, and reporting of EMP activities during the initial phase of the Project.   \nG.  Cost Estimates for Assessment, Monitoring, and Training \n46.  The  PMCBU  estimates  include  36  person-months  for  environmental  specialists  (12 \nperson-months international; 24 person-months domestic). In addition, the estimates include \nprovisional  sums  for  up  to  13  person-months  of  technical  services,  if  required.  The \nenvironmental specialists are expected to be employed full time during the assessment phase \nand intermittently during the monitoring phase.  \n47.  The  PMCBU  on  average  will  spend  40%  of  its  time  on  training.  The  international \nenvironmental specialists are expected to devote approximately 50% of their time to training the \ndomestic specialist and staff of the Environment and Conservation Department (ECD), who will \nhave oversight responsibilities. \nH.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n48.  Consultations will be held during project implementation with representative community \nleaders and community members along the subproject road sections.   \n49.  During consultations for the Ghizo sample subproject, local residents raised concerns \nover road safety and the loss of coconut trees if the road corridor needed to be widened. Some \nexpressed an interest in having road designs incorporate speed bumps for all areas with houses \nand schools near the road. These concerns will be addressed through the project design, as \nwell  as  through  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan.  In  general,  local \ncommunities displayed positive attitudes and a strong desire to see the roads improved. \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \nI.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n50.  The activities outlined for the Project are rehabilitation in scope, and no new construction \nis planned. The findings of the sample subproject IEE confirm that this Project should be \ndesignated as ADB environmental category B. No component activities of the sector project \nrequire a full EIA.  \n51.  Project  activities  are  expected  to  have  only  minor  and  temporary  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  during  construction.  These  are  considered  tolerable  with  adherence  to  the \nsubproject environmental selection criteria and the defined mitigating measures, and as detailed \nin the subproject-specific EMP. With proper road maintenance, no significant adverse impacts \nwill result from the existence and operation of the roads themselves. Maintenance activities will \nproduce minor impacts, though these are manageable through a continuation of the engineering \npractices and mitigation measures specified by the EMP. \n52.  In terms of capacity building in the Government environment sector, the Project should \nprovide local training of PMCBU and MID staff to undertake supervision, review, and reporting \nof EMP activities. The Project also should provide opportunities to the ECD of the Ministry for \nthe Environment to participate in PMCBU training and capacity building activities. This would \nenable  ECD  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  of  the  Government\u2019s  Environment  Act  are \nimplemented.  \n ", " \nTable A10: OUTLINE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN \n \n \nEnvironmental Issues and  Implementing  Responsible \nMitigation Measures Required  Monitoring Activity \nPotential Impacts  Organization   Organization \nPre-Construction Phase   \n\u2022  Soil erosion and sediment  i.

A project performance and monitoring system will be established within 6 months of \ngrant  effectiveness.  Performance  indicators  to  be  monitored  before,  during,  and  after \nconstruction  should  include  those  for  (i)  economic  development,  (ii)  transport  sector \nperformance, (iii) socioeconomic development, (iv) environmental impacts, (v) maintenance, \nand (vi) institutional development. Based on these guidelines the Executing Agency (EA) and \nthe Project Management Capacity Building Unit (PMCBU) will develop quantitative indicators for \nmonitoring and evaluating project performance in relation to its goals and purposes before \nproject commencement, and will refine these indicators during project implementation. \n2.  Baseline data for these indicators, which will be collected during the subproject feasibility \nanalysis, will be monitored after subproject completion. Some baseline data might become \navailable  from  two  national  surveys\u2014of  household  income  and  expenditure,  and  of \ndemographics and health\u2014to be conducted in 2006\u20132007. Monitoring and evaluation will be \nbased on gender-disaggregated data where feasible. The PMCBU will monitor and evaluate \nprogress on these indicators annually, and provide a final report within 6 months of the end of \nthe contract. \nA.  Economic Development \n3.   Improved accessibility is expected to increase output volume and prices of agricultural \ncommodities in the subproject areas. Baseline data on the production and prices of copra, \ncocoa, and market produce should be collected and updated. \n4.  Baseline data on formal and informal employment, disaggregated by sector or activity, \nshould be collected and updated. During and after rehabilitation, data should be kept on the \namount of employment created in rehabilitation and regular maintenance. \n5.  Indicators for annual household income and sources of income should be developed, \nbaseline data collected, and updated annually. The percentage of poverty or hardship of the \npopulation or households in the project area also should be estimated. \nB.  Transport Sector Performance \n6.  Subproject feasibility studies will document the conditions of roads, and measure and \nforecast  a  range  of  technical  performance  indicators  (Table  A11.1).  Appropriate  indicators \nshould be developed for rural conditions, which can be used during feasibility surveys, updated \nafter rehabilitation, and monitored before and after annual maintenance. In addition, because \ntransport demand is linked to gross domestic product (GDP), the real annual GDP growth rates \nfor the country (and for the provinces, where available) should be reported with the results.   \n \nTable A11.1: Transport Sector Performance Indicators \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \nCondition  \u2022  Roughness  \u2022  Poor/fair/good \n\u2022  Accessibility  \u2022  All weather/seasonal \nPerformance  \u2022  Traffic volumes  \u2022  AADT \n\u2022  Traffic growth  \u2022  % per year \n\u2022  Travel times to key destinations  \u2022  Average  \n\u2022  Vehicle ownership  \u2022  By vehicle type \n\u2022  Frequency of public transport services  \u2022  Number per day ", "Appendix 11  61   \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \n\u2022  Cost of passenger transport services  \u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Cost of freight transport services  \u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Accident rates  \u2022  Number per year \nAADT = average annual daily traffic, SBD \u2013 Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nC.  Socioeconomic Development \n7.  Indicators  should  be  developed  on  access  to  social  services,  including  school \nenrollment, visits to health facilities, and visits to government centers. \n8.  In addition to the economic development indicators specified above, information on \ngender-specific impacts of the Project should be developed, including increased employment \nand income for women and youth.  \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n9.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Project,  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  sample  subproject  at  Ghizo,  include  environmental \nmanagement plans that identify specific environmental impacts that must be monitored during \nand after rehabilitation.  \nE.  Road Maintenance Inputs \n10.  All road maintenance work, including routine and periodic work carried out by traditional \nand labor-based equipment supported methods, should be recorded, including (i) nature of the \nwork; (ii) physical quantities of work performed; (iii) cost of the work; (iv) form of execution (by \ndirect labor, small contract, or large contractor); and (v) location and extent of the work.   \nF.  Institutional Development \n11.  Two  important  institutional  development  outputs  of  the  Project  are  (i)  enhanced \nmaintenance arrangements, with improved participation of communities and women in road \nmaintenance; and (ii) improved capabilities in the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development \n(MID) for project appraisal, management, supervision and monitoring. Accordingly, the PMCBU \nand MID should develop and monitor indicators, as shown in Table A11.2. \nTable A11.2: Institutional Development Indicators \nItem  Indicators  Remarks \nEnhanced maintenance  \u2022  Quantity maintained  \u2022  Total km, value in SBD \n\u2022  Private sector contracts  \u2022  Number, value in SBD \n\u2022  Community group contracts  \u2022  Number, value in SBD \n\u2022  Road asset management system  \u2022  Completion on schedule \nImproved capacity in MID  \u2022  TPPU staffing  \u2022  Positions, job descriptions \n\u2022  Training  \u2022  Number, topics \n\u2022  Updates of National Transport Plan  \u2022  Completion on schedule \n\u2022  Updates of contract procedure manuals  \u2022  Completion on schedule \n\u2022  Condition surveys  \u2022  Number, schedule \n\u2022  Progress reports  \u2022  Completion on schedule \nSBD = Solomon Islands dollar, TPPU = Transport Policy and Planning Unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060818110857+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060718111407+08'00'", "Title": "Road Improvement (Sector) Project", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Company": "ADB", "SourceModified": "D:20060718020122"}}
