An initial environmental examination (IEE) that includes an \nIEE \nfor  a  sample  project  was  undertaken.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  was  prepared  to  guide \nsubproject  selection  and  environmental  assessment  during  project \nimplementation. The summary IEE is in Appendix 10. The sample IEE \nand EARP are in Supplementary Appendices B and E, respectively. \n\n(ii) \nrural \nincluding  development  and \n\nThe Project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the national \nnetwork of provincial and secondary roads through (i) rehabilitation of \nroad  maintenance \nabout  100  kilometers  of \nimplementation  of \nimprovements, \nmanagement  systems,  assistance  with  implementation  of  a  national \ntransport  fund,  and  participation  of  private  sector  contractors  and \ncommunities  in  routine  maintenance  and  labor-based  equipment \nsupported  methods;  and  (iii)  project  management  and  capacity \nbuilding. \n\nroads; \n\nSolomon  Islands  is  emerging  from  several  years  of  conflict  (1999\u2013\n2003),  and  is  one  of  the  least  developed  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB)  Pacific  developing  member  countries.  The  country  is \nranked  second  lowest  among  Pacific  island  countries  in  the  United \nNations\u2019  Human  Development  Index,  and  is  unlikely  to  meet  most  of \nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \n\nThe  socioeconomic  situation  is  characterized  by  high  unemployment, \nespecially among the youth, and one of the highest population growth \nrates in the world. Combined with slow economic growth, this situation \nexacerbates  poverty.  Due  to  the  conflict,  real  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  per  capita  has  declined  by  about  35%  since  1999  to  about \n$500.  \n\nInvestment in the road network, which never has been adequate, has \ndeclined  in  recent  years,  leaving  the  sector  badly  underfunded.  The \nroad  network  is  sparse,  and  does  not  reach  77%  of  the  rural \npopulation.  The  road  network  has  been  constructed  with  low  design \nstandards  and  poor  quality  materials.  As  a  result,  only  20%  of  roads \nare estimated to be in good condition, with the remainder not passable \nby light vehicles.  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs a poorly developed and weakly performing nation, Solomon Islands \nfaces many challenges. The most pressing issues include (i) sustained \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  increased  employment  and  income-generation \nopportunities,  (iii)  an  improved  legal  and  institutional  framework  to \nmanage  and  administer  public  sector  responsibilities,  and  (iv) \nimproved  human  and  institutional  capacity.  Improvement  in  these \nareas is expected to reduce poverty. \n\nPro-poor  economic  growth,  as  well  as  improvements  in  social  and \nhealth indicators, depends on revitalization and decentralization of the \nrural  economy.  Better  transportation  infrastructure  and  services  are \nessential  to  removing  barriers  to  market  access  and  promote  rural \nproduction. The Government recognizes the overarching importance of \ninfrastructure  to  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  society;  and  that \nimproving  infrastructure,  particularly  transport,  is  critical  to  increasing \nagricultural productivity, fostering private sector development, reducing \npoverty,  promoting \ninvestment  and  human  development,  and \nstrengthening public capacity to deliver services. \n\nIn  recognition  of  ADB\u2019s  long  experience  and  implementation  of \nongoing  projects  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  Solomon  Islands\u2019 \nroad  sector,  as  well  as  its  expertise  in  designing  and  monitoring \nsafeguards, the Government requested that ADB take the lead in the \nroad  sector.  Other  partners  agreed  through  a  well-established  aid \ncoordination process. \n\nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update identifies the development \nof  transportation  infrastructure  and  services  as  one  of  the  two  main \nareas  for  ADB  assistance.  ADB  is  implementing  a  TA  to  address \ncross-sectoral  infrastructure  issues  and  technical  capacity  building  in \nthe  road  sector.  The  Project,  therefore,  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of \nphysical  road  infrastructure.  As  a  post-conflict  and  heavily  indebted \ncountry, Solomon Islands is eligible for grant financing from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF).  An  ADF  grant  will  leverage  significant \ncofinancing from bilateral partners. \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  is  expected  to  increase  economic  growth  and  reduce \npoverty  in  the  project  area  by  (i)  improving  the  accessibility  of  rural \nresidents  to  markets,  as  well  as  economic  and  social  services;  (ii) \nfostering  market \npromoting  private  sector-led  development;  (iii) \nformation,  and  facilitating  domestic  and  international  trade;  and  (iv) \ngenerating  income  and  job  opportunities.  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved road infrastructure for economic and social development. \n\nProject Investment \nPlan \n\nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $16.85 million. \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\n \nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nGovernment of Australia \n\nGovernment of New Zealand \n\nGovernment of Solomon Islands \n\n \n\niii\n\n \nPercent \n\n2.08 \n\n36.20 \n\n57.86 \n\n3.86 \n\n \nTotal \n\n0.35 \n\n6.10 \n\n9.75 \n\n0.65 \n\nGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\nTotal \n\n16.85 \n\n100.00 \n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $0.35  million  from  the  ADF.

Civil \nworks are expected to begin in October 2007, physical completion by \n31 December 2010, and grant closing by 30 June 2011. \n\nProcurement  under  the  Project,  including  for  ADB  and  Government-\nfinanced  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Major \ncivil  works  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Minor  civil  works  for  maintenance  will  be  procured  using \nnational  competitive  bidding,  shopping,  and  community  procurement \nprocedures. \n\nInternational  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i) \nengineering  design  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents;  (ii) \nconstruction  supervision;  (iii)  road  maintenance  procedures,  including \n(iv)  project \nformulation  of  policies, \nmanagement;  (v)  capacity  building  and  institutional  development,  (vi) \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vii)  financial  auditing;  and \n(viii)  community  participation  initiatives.

Greater  accessibility  will  increase  health  and  educational \nachievement,  and  facilitate  the  participation  of  women  and  youth  in \neconomic and social activities. The Project also will provide people in \nthe  project  area  with  immediate  income-generating  opportunities. \nDirect  benefits  will  include  lower  cost  of  transport  services,  reduced \ntravel time, and more efficient road maintenance expenditures.  \n\nSubprojects  will  be  assessed  based  on  their  contribution  to  national \ndevelopment  objectives  and  priorities.  Selection  criteria  will  require \nsubprojects to be economically viable, with a target economic internal \nrate  of  return  greater  than  12%.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  at  the \nsubproject  level  will  be  gender-disaggregated,  taking  into  account  (i) \nthe  differential  project  impacts  and  risks  facing  women,  (ii)  gender-\nspecific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii)  the  interests  and  capacities  of  women  to  contribute  to  road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  be  proactive  in \nensuring women\u2019s involvement in road rehabilitation and maintenance, \nHIV/AIDS prevention, and road safety activities of the Project. \n\nThe  project  design  considers  potential  risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement  and  rehabilitation  quality.  The  Project  will  establish  a \nProject  Management  and  Capacity  Building  Unit  to  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to handle increased responsibilities.

More than 80% of the population of 475,000 is rural, living in widely dispersed \nvillages  of  a  few  hundred  persons.  The  country,  especially  in  rural  areas,  lacks  adequate \ninfrastructure  and  services.  The  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the \nnational road network to increase rural accessibility and promote development. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nSolomon Islands is a weakly performing country1 emerging from several years of conflict \n3. \n(1999\u20132003), and is one of the least developed of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific \ndeveloping  member  countries.  In  the  United  Nations\u2019  Human  Development  Index,  Solomon \nIslands  ranks  second  lowest  among  Pacific  island  countries.  The  country  is  unlikely  to  meet \nmost  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  2015.  The  socioeconomic  situation  is \ncharacterized  by  high  unemployment  (about  75%  of  the  population  is  not  formally  employed), \nespecially among the youth, and rapid population growth. The population growth rate of 2.9% is \namong  the  highest  in  the  world.  Combined  with  slow  economic  growth,  the  socioeconomic \nsituation exacerbates poverty. \n\n4. \nThe  economy  is  based  on  primary  commodities  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing. \nJobs  are  limited,  with  only  about  a  quarter  of  the  population  formally  employed.  Income-\ngenerating  opportunities  are  scarce  in  rural  areas.  During  the  conflict,  real  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  per  capita  declined  by  35%  to  about  $500.  Since  2003,  GDP  growth  has \naveraged  4\u20135%  per  year.  Still,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  Central  Bank  of  Solomon \nIslands estimate that the economy will require another 20 years to return to the pre-conflict level \nof GDP per capita. \n\n5. \nThe  road  network  is sparse,  reaching  only  23%  of  rural  villages  with about  20% of  the \nnational  population.  About  60%  of  the  network  is  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita,  which  serve \nabout 90% of the traffic in the country. Sealed or graveled roads are confined to Guadalcanal \nand Malaita, which also have the only significant inland roads, and a segment of secondary road \nin Western Province. Other provinces have relatively short coastal segments of gravel or earth \nroads near provincial centers. The network has about 185 watercourse crossings, mostly small \nlog bridges with few steel or reinforced concrete structures. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n\n6. \nInvestment in the road network, which never has been adequate, has declined in recent \nyears,  leaving  the  sector  badly  underfunded  and  deteriorating.  Development  partners  have \nfunded  most  of  the  road  construction,  providing  $81  million  over  the  past  15  years.  That  is \nequivalent  to  about  18%  of  the  Government\u2019s  development  budget  in  those  years.  Over  the \nsame  period,  the  Government  invested  about  $9  million  and  committed  an  average  of  about \n$0.5 million per year in maintenance funding through the recurrent budget. External assistance \nis summarized in Appendix 3. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  term  \u201cweakly  performing  country\u201d  should  be  considered  synonymous  with  \u201cfragile  state\u201d,  as  used  in  the \n\ndocuments of other development partners active in the country. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  road  network  has  been  constructed  with  poor  design  standards  and  materials. \n7. \nAbout  8%  of  national  roads  are  sealed,  about  61%  are  gravel  surfaced,  and  the  rest  are \nearthen. Shoulders are nonexistent, and drainage is poorly constructed and maintained. Roads \nthroughout  the  country  have  deteriorated  due  to  years  of  neglect  and  deferred  maintenance. \nOnly about 20% of the roads in Solomon Islands are estimated to be in good or fair condition; \nthe remainder are so deteriorated that they are impassable by cars and light trucks, and need \nrehabilitation. Similarly, as bridges have exceeded their design life, only about 25% are in good \ncondition,  with  30%  needing  minor  repairs,  37%  requiring  major  repairs,  and  8%  closed  to \ntraffic. The condition of the network does not provide much rural accessibility or optimize road \nagency  and  road  user  costs,  thus  restricting  the  contribution  of  road  transport  to  economic \ngrowth, poverty reduction, and social development.  \n\nThe  poor  condition  of  many  roads  has  lowered  travel  speeds,  increased  fuel \n8. \nconsumption,  and  raised  vehicle  operating  costs.  Rough  surfaces  also  have  reduced  the \neconomic lives of the vehicles and suppressed road transport demand. Outside Honiara, road \ntransport costs are estimated to be 25% higher, and travel speeds are approximately half what \nthey  would  be  if  the  roads  were  in  good  condition.  Road  access  for  rural  areas  has  declined \ndramatically due to severe deterioration, road closures, and collapsed bridges.  \n\n9. \nDue to the sparse road network, the main form of transport in rural areas is by small boat \naround  coastal  areas.  Road  transport  services  are  provided  by  small-scale  private  companies \nand informally by a few vehicle owner-operators using market trucks, tractors, and small vans. \nThere are no publicly operated transport services, nor is there regulation of passenger or freight \ncharges. Traffic volumes are very low outside of Honiara. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Development  (MID)  is  responsible  for  road \n10. \ndevelopment  and  maintenance.  Maintenance  funding  has  been  inadequate,  and  works  have \ntypically been carried out by MID\u2019s own forces. Opportunities for the private sector have been \nlimited  and  uneven,  constraining  its  development.  Before  the  conflict,  MID  maintained  a  large \nlabor force that was not always fully utilized. Staffing levels fell greatly during the conflict, and \nhave not been restored. MID has recognized the need to rebuild its skills in asset planning and \nmanagement,  contract  administration,  and  policy  and  strategy  development.  As  a  result,  it  is \nnow recruiting more professional staff and training them with ADB assistance.  \n\n1. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n11. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  vision,  priorities,  and  strategies  are  articulated  in  the \nNational  Economic  Recovery,  Reform,  and  Development  Plan  2003\u20132006  (NERRDP).2  It \nidentifies key strategic areas for revitalizing the productive sector and rebuilding infrastructure, \nand  for  restoring  basic  social  services  and  fostering  social  development.  The  NERRDP \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  transport  infrastructure  as  an  enabling  input  for  community \ndevelopment.  The  Government  expects  that  implementation  of  the  plan,  with  a  preferential \nfocus  on  disadvantaged  and  rural  populations,  will  lead  to  more  equitable  distribution  of \nincreasing  incomes,  social  services,  and  development  among  provinces,  social  groups,  and \ngenders.  All  stakeholders  agree  that  the  NERRDP  is  the  appropriate  basis  for  prioritizing  and \ncoordinating  sector  activities.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  take  the  lead  among \ndevelopment partners in coordinating assistance to the transport sector. \n\n                                                 \n2  Solomon  Islands  Government.  2003.  National  Economic  Recovery,  Reform,  and  Development  Plan  2003\u20132006. \n\nHoniara. (A successor to this plan is being prepared.) \n\n\fThe Transport Sector Strategy3 contains the national transport policies and strategies. It \n12. \nfocuses  on  (i)  rehabilitating  high-priority  roads  and  bridges  in  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita;  (ii) \nextending  similar  rehabilitation  to  other  provinces;  (iii)  strengthening  capacity  to  manage \nprojects,  contracts,  and  road  assets;  (iv)  promoting  the  participation  of  the  private  sector, \ncommunities,  women,  and  youth  groups  for  maintenance;  and  (v)  establishing  a  dedicated \ntransport fund with sustainable revenues from user charges, fuel taxes, and vehicle fees.  \n \n13. \nThe Transport Sector Strategy will be implemented according to the National Transport \nPlan  (NTP).  The  NTP  provides  the  framework  and  action  plan  for  developing  and  maintaining \nphysical  infrastructure,  facilitating  transport  services,  improving  the  capacity  of  Government \nagencies,  and  enhancing  private  sector  participation  (Appendix  2).4  The  NTP,  which  was \nendorsed in May 2006 and will be updated every 5 years, is supported by a three-year rolling \nworks program that  will be updated annually. An official Transport Task Force (TTF) including \nrepresentatives  of  Government,  transport  users,  and  transport  service  providers  has  been \nestablished to advise on key issues, development options, and prioritization. \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy and Program \n\n14. \nInfrastructure investments are needed to support economic growth, employment, poverty \nreduction, and social development. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for 2006\u201320075 \nprioritizes  two  major  areas  for  ADB  assistance:  transportation  infrastructure  and  services,  and \nan enabling business environment. It also identifies institutional capacity development as central \nto all activities. These three themes are complementary. \n\nADB  is  implementing  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project6  (PCERP)  to \n15. \nrehabilitate  roads  and  bridges  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita  that  were  damaged  during  the \nconflict.  A  project  management  unit  operates  under  the  direction  of  a  project  steering \ncommittee,  comprising  representatives  from  the  ministries  responsible  for  finance,  planning, \nnational unity, and provincial government, as well as the concerned sectoral ministries. Physical \nworks, which began in June 2005 and are about 30% complete, are scheduled for completion in \nFebruary 2007. A recent change of scope, cofinanced by the Government of Australia and the \nGovernment of New Zealand, enabled ADB to expand this project.  \n\nTo  leverage  scarce  public  sector  resources  and  promote  opportunities  for  the  private \n16. \nsector,  MID  will  decrease  its  direct  provision  of  works  to  concentrate  on  policy  development, \nregulation,  asset  management,  and  contract  administration.  ADB  is  providing  technical \nassistance (TA) for an institutional strengthening project (footnote 4) to support the transition. A \nNational  Transport  Plan,  National  Transport  Fund  and  Transport  Policy  and  Planning  Unit  are \nbeing  developed  and  used  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  development  partners  to  plan \ninterventions.  \n\nIn  recognition  of  ADB\u2019s  long  experience  in  implementing  projects  and  TA  in  the  road \n17. \nsector in Solomon Islands, as well as its expertise in designing and monitoring safeguards, the \nGovernment requested and other partners agreed that ADB take the lead in coordinating aid to \nin the road sector.

The NTP is a key factor in coordination. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n18. \nAs  a  weakly  performing  country  emerging  from  several  years  of  conflict,  Solomon \nIslands is confronting many challenges and opportunities. The most pressing issues include (i) \nsustained economic growth, (ii) increased employment and income-generating opportunities, (iii) \nan improved institutional framework to manage and administer public sector responsibilities, and \n(iv) improved human and institutional capacity. Progress in these areas is expected to contribute \ndirectly to poverty reduction. A review of road sector activities, policies and institutions, capacity \nbuilding progress, and lessons learned is in Appendix 2. \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\nEmployment  and  Income  Generation.  Falling  commodity  prices,  deteriorating  rural \n19. \ninfrastructure,  lack  of  rural  services  and  access  to  markets,  and  low-productivity  traditional \ncultivation  practices  hamper  rural  agricultural  development.  Poor  and  expensive  infrastructure \nfacilities and services, a weak legal and institutional business environment, poor business and \nbanking  services,  and  a  limited  market  constrain  the  development  of  the  private  sector. \nEmployment growth, therefore, is severely constrained. \n\n20. \nSector  Investments,  Operations,  and  Sustainability.  Road  sustainability  is  a  major \nchallenge.  Financial  constraints,  poor  equipment  maintenance,  and  geographical  conditions \nhave  contributed  to  poor  maintenance  for  many  years.  As  a  result,  many  roads  need  to  be \nrehabilitated.  Development  partners  are  assisting  with  the  rehabilitation  of  some  roads  and \nbridges in areas most damaged by the conflict. Rehabilitating and maintaining the road network \nfor  new \nrequire  significant \ninvestments,  and  cannot  borrow  due  to  its  high  debt  burden.  Therefore,  prioritizing  and \nsequencing  to  maximize  the  benefits  are  essential.  Past  efforts,  which  have  focused  on  basic \nmaintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  emergency  works,  have  been  inadequate  and  costly.  A  shift \nfrom this reactive approach to a preventive asset management approach is needed to sustain \nthe network.   \n\nthe  Government  has  not  budgeted \n\ninvestment.  However, \n\n21. \nRoad  Network  Development.  The  Government  has  invested  about  $9  million  from \ndomestic sources and $81 million from external resources in the road sector over the past two \ndecades.  However,  due  to  poor  design  and  construction  standards,  and  negligible  asset \nmanagement,  about  80%  of  the  road  network  is  no  longer  maintainable,  and  requires \nreconstruction or rehabilitation. Almost all national, provincial, and secondary roads require road \nrepairs  and  replacement  of  bridges,  reshaping  and  strengthening  of  pavement,  and \nimprovement  to  drainage.  Village  and  farm  roads  also  need  improvement  to  distribute  the \nbenefits to poor rural communities.   \n\n22. \nRoad Asset Funding and Maintenance. Road maintenance funding has averaged $0.5 \nmillion annually since 1990. However, funding fell by 80% to an average of $0.1 million during \nthe  1998\u20132002  conflict,  resulting  in  widespread  deterioration,  and  has  remained  significantly \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2005.  Implementation  of  Interisland  Transport  Reforms.  Manila  (TA  4588-SOL,  approved  in  May  2005  for \n\n8 ADB. 2004. Diagnostic Assessment of Interisland Transport. Manila. (TA 4527-SOL, approved in December 2004 \n\n$495,000). \n\nfor $350,000). \n\n\fbelow  the  level  necessary  to  sustain  current  assets.  The  proportion  of  this  funding  that  goes \ntoward  maintenance,  versus  public  sector  overhead  costs,  is  unclear  due  to  limited \naccountability.  Maintaining  the  20%  of  the  road  network  that  remains  in  good  or  fair  condition \nwould cost an estimated $1.6 million annually, or three times the current allocation.  \n\nInstitutional  Capacity.  Institutional  capacity  constraints  have  hindered  MID\u2019s  ability  to \n23. \ndevelop  and  implement  road  maintenance  policies.  Declining  public  sector  budgets,  poor \ntraining,  and  conflict-related  impacts  have  resulted  in  an  inadequate  human  resource  base. \nManagerial,  administrative,  technical,  and  vocational  skills  are  in  short  supply  in  all  sectors  of \nthe  economy  and  public  service.  Public  sector  recruitment  has  been  a  particular  bottleneck  to \nprogress,  with  about  25%  of  established  and  budgeted  positions  unfilled.  These  problems  are \nacute in the road sector. An ADB TA project (footnote 4) is providing training and professional \nsupport for road planning, project preparation and implementation, and asset management. The  \nprivate contracting industry has little capacity and capability to perform major road maintenance \nand rehabilitation. MID will explore opportunities for local contractors to work with international \ncontractors  to  develop  knowledge,  skills,  and  experience  on  major  contracts.  In  addition, \noutsourcing  routine  and  minor  periodic  maintenance  contracts  to  local  contractors  will  help  to \ndevelop the private sector, while strengthening MID\u2019s role in asset management. \n\nInterest \n\nin  developing  effective \n\nLabor-based  Methods. \n\n24. \nlabor-based  equipment \nsupported (LBES) approaches for routine road maintenance is strong. Compared to traditional \nmethods, LBES technology increases the labor  component, supported by small fleets of basic \nequipment.  It  is  intended  to  increase  the  participation  of  small-scale  private  sector  and \ncommunity  groups,  with  the  potential  for  rural  employment  and  poverty  reduction.  Although \npromising, such projects have had mixed results in Solomon Islands. While an LBES project for \nrural  roads9  on  Malaita  has  shown  some  success,  a  subsequent  LBES  project10  in  2003  on \nGuadalcanal was not sustained due to poor routine maintenance. More recently, the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  Community  Sector  Project  on  Malaita  and \nGuadalcanal  successfully  uses  LBES  methods  for  some  aspects  of  rehabilitation.11  LBES \nprojects  that  have  used  performance-based  contracts  have  been  more  successful  than  those \ndone by force account. LBES methods are described in detail in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n25. \nLessons  Learned.  Most  projects  in  the  road  sector  have  used  force  account \nprocedures, with only a few done by contract. Projects lacked quality at entry and were built to \npoor  standards,  which  made  them  unsustainable.  Key  institutional  and  policy  issues  were  not \nresolved, including (i) inaction on overloaded logging trucks, (ii) shortfall in maintenance funding \nin favor of capital expenditure, and (iii) failure to institutionalize an effective asset management \nsystem.  More  recently,  PCERP  encountered  initial  delays  because  (i)  the  inexperienced \nexecuting  agency  (EA)  required  training  in  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  selection  of  consultants,  (ii) \nrecruitment of local staff was delayed, and (iii) conflict eventually required the suspension of the \nproject. Following the resumption and training, however, the project is now being implemented \nsmoothly.  Successful  implementation  of  LBES  methods  requires  close  attention  to  training, \nsupervision,  and  performance  standards,  as  well  as commitment  to  routine  maintenance  once \ninitial rehabilitation is completed. \n\n                                                 \n9   United  Nations  Development  Program  /  International  Labor  Organization.  1990.

Clear \nopportunities  exist  to  improve  performance  and  increase  benefits  through  a  comprehensive \napproach  involving  asset  management,  institutional  reform,  better  planning,  and  increased \ncapacity.  \n\ninvestment  and  maintenance  decisions,  and \n\n27. \nSector-Wide  Approach.  Ad  hoc  management  of  the  road  sector  has  led  to  poor \nlimited  asset \nprioritization,  opportunistic \npreservation. The Government and its development partners agree that a sector-wide approach \nis needed in the medium term to improve national control and ownership through the NERRDP \nand NTP. Given the constrained circumstances and development goals, Government policies to \nincrease  private  sector \nlimit  new \nparticipation  to  concentrate  on  planning  and  management,  and  build  capacity  to  improve \nplanning  and  finance  decisions  are  appropriate.  The  Government  is  using  a  sector-wide \napproach successfully in education, and is developing a similar approach to health. Supported \nby  the  necessary  institutional  reforms  in  MID,  this  experience  can  be  transferred  to  the  road \nsector. The Project will begin to establish the capacity and procedures to operate a sector-wide \napproach. \n\ninvestment  and  concentrate  on  asset  preservation, \n\nImproved  Infrastructure  for  Economic  Development  and  Rural  Employment.  An \n28. \nimproved  and  sustainable  rural  road  network  can  enhance  rural  economic  development \nsignificantly.  Rehabilitated  roads  will  improve  access  and  lower  costs  of  transport,  which  will \nraise rural incomes and stimulate production and employment. Focusing on the rehabilitation of \nprovincial and secondary roads can ensure connectivity and lower costs of access to markets, \ntowns, and social facilities. Contracting road maintenance through LBES methods will generate \nincome for the rural population. \n\nDevelopment  Planning  and  Finance.  The  Government  is  updating  the  NERRDP  and \n29. \nits associated implementation plan, based on the NTP. From 2006, the Government will prepare \na  unified  development  and  recurrent  budget  to  improve  the  link  between  investments  and \nmaintenance.  Government  planning  and  financial  management  reforms  underway  at  the \nnational level will complement and strengthen similar reforms in the transport sector. \n\n30. \nInstitutional  Reform  and  MID  Capacity  Building.  MID\u2019s  transition  from  providing \nworks directly to focusing on planning and asset management will facilitate a more effective and \ntransparent use of limited resources, and promote private sector participation. Targeted capacity \nbuilding, as part of a package of comprehensive implementation assistance, is supporting and \naccelerating the transition. The Transport Policy and Planning Unit (TPPU), with oversight from \nthe  TTF,  coordinate  complementary  project  and  TA  activities  supported  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n\n31. \nLabor-Based  Equipment  Supported  Maintenance  Methods.  Existing  roads  in \noperable  condition  and  newly  rehabilitated  roads  can  be  preserved  through  relatively  simple \nroutine  maintenance.  LBES  methods,  which  can  extend  the  life  of  roads  and  minimize \nexpenditures,  can  be  more  sustainable  than  traditional  methods  in  areas  with  adequate  labor \nsupply but poor access to capital and equipment. When supported by appropriate maintenance \npolicies,  institutionalization  of  a  contracting  system  for  communities  and  private  sector \ncontractors,  skills  development,  and  supervision,  LBES  methods  generate  business \nopportunities  and  income  for  local  communities.  This  increases  their  sense  of  ownership,  and \nsupports stability and security. \n\n\fCommunity and Gender Participation. Communities have an obvious interest in good \n32. \nroads, which creates an opportunity to involve them actively in rehabilitation and maintenance. \nConsultations  allow  them  to  determine  how  they  will  contribute,  and  on  what  terms  (e.g.,  by \ncontributing  labor  or  aggregates).  An  LBES  approach  to  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance \nallows  the  capacities  and  contributions  of  communities,  including  youth,  to  be  utilized \nproactively. A gender-aware approach to community liaison and consultations can ensure that \nthe  perspectives  and  capabilities  of  women  are  taken  into  account,  and  that  an  appropriate \nparticipation strategy is devised.  \n\n3. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n33. \nPro-poor  economic  growth  and  improvement  in  social and  health  indicators  depend  on \nthe  revitalization  and  decentralization  of  the  rural  economy.  The  poor  condition  of  roads  is  a \nconstraint to the movement of people and goods, and a disincentive to productive rural activity. \nImproved  transportation  infrastructure  and  services,  which  would  provide  reliable  access  to \ndomestic  and  international  markets  for  rural  produce  and  commodities,  are  critical  to  (i) \nrestarting  and  building  rural  economies,  (ii)  reducing  migration  of  people  in  search  of \nemployment,  (iii)  decreasing  conflict  between  groups  competing  for  limited  opportunities,  and \n(iv) restoring basic social services in rural areas. The focus on improving rural accessibility will \nenhance poverty reduction. \n\n34.  Most  previous  projects,  representing  more  than  90%  of  road  sector  investment,  have \nfocused  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita.  The  other  seven  provinces  consistently  have  received \nless attention, and have been subject to more deferred maintenance. As a result, provincial and \nsecondary roads in these other rural provinces are so badly deteriorated that they can no longer \nbe maintained, and urgently need rehabilitation. The Government requested preparation of the \nProject with a preferential focus on addressing the urgent needs in the rest of the country. Final \nsubproject selection will be based on the priorities established in the NTP. \n\nThe Government has embarked on institutional reforms, with ADB assistance, to ensure \n35. \nits capacity to implement a sector project effectively. The policy framework in the Government\u2019s \nTransport  Sector  Strategy,  which  is  appropriate  to  the  country\u2019s  circumstances,  is  driving \ndevelopment  of  an  operational  action  plan  to  implement  the  NTP.  This  plan  also  will  optimize \nthe  use  of  domestic  and  external  resources  to  reduce  constraints  caused  by  road  network \nconditions. With the comprehensive implementation assistance and capacity building under the \nProject,  this  process  will  create  the  necessary  capacity  to  implement  these  plans,  as  well  as \ncontribute to the Government\u2019s ability to meet the goals in the NERRDP.  \n\n36. \nThese considerations present opportunities to consolidate reform. Given the widespread \nneed  for  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and  investment,  these  issues  must  be  addressed  in \nparallel  across  all  aspects  of  the  sector.  Eventually  a  sector-wide  approach  to  external \ndevelopment  assistance  based  on  domestic  processes  will  promote  effective  planning  and \nimplementation  of  works  in  the  long  term.  The  Project  will  help  Government  to  build  the \ninstitutional framework and capacity to implement such an approach effectively. \n\n37. \nBy instituting a participatory approach to planning and maintenance, the Project also will \nincrease community involvement, improve the responsiveness of the Government\u2019s sector plans \nto  community  needs,  and  stimulate  rural  economies  through  increased  productivity  and \nopportunities for occasional labor.  \n\nThe Project represents the direct implementation of ADB\u2019s strategy for Solomon Islands \n38. \nby  (i)  upgrading  and  preserving \nfacilitating  expanded \ntransportation services, (iii) improving the enabling environment for private sector development, \n\ninfrastructure,  (ii) \n\ntransportation \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nand  (iv)  providing  opportunities  for  direct  private  sector  and  community  participation.  Further, \nthe  Project  will  guide  future  external  assistance  in  the  road  sector  through  better  aid \ncoordination  and  consistent  development  planning,  while  serving  as  a  basis  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s road sector investments. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT   \n\n39. \nThe Project is expected to increase economic growth and reduce poverty in the project \narea.  It  will  (i)  improve  accessibility  to  economic  opportunities;  (ii)  promote  agricultural \ndevelopment;  (iii)  foster  market  access,  and  facilitate  domestic  and  international  trade;  (iv) \ngenerate  income  and  employment  opportunities;  and  (v)  improve  access  to  public  and  social \nservices. The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n40. \nComponent  A:  Road  Rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  finance  a  portion  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  expected  road  rehabilitation  works  over  5  years  of  the  NTP.  This  will  include \nabout 100 kilometers of roads, of which about 15% will be sealed roads and about 85% gravel \nroads,  and  about  40  watercourse  crossings  (bridges,  culverts,  and  wet  crossings).  Each \nsubproject will be prioritized and selected in accordance with the process and eligibility criteria \nin  Appendix  5.  A  systematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject \nappraisal,  covering  (i)  social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii) \nprocurement;  (iv)  implementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will \nprovide sufficient evidence of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will be in accordance \nwith  the  detail  and  quality  required  to  enable  ADB  to  assess  the  viability  and  suitability  of  the \nsubproject.  No  subproject  categorized  as  category  A,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  (2002)  or  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  will  be  financed  under  the \nProject.  Implementation  will  incorporate  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  and  general \nhealth and safety activities, as appropriate.  \n\nfinancial,  management,  and \n\nComponent  B:  Road  Maintenance \n\nImprovement.  This  component  addresses \n41. \ninstitutional, \nimplementation  aspects  of  road  and  bridge \nmaintenance through three subcomponents. The Project will implement the steps to be taken by \nthe  Government  in  strengthening  asset  management  and  financing.  It also  will  provide  annual \nmaintenance  of  rehabilitated  roads  during  the  Project  by  routine  and  LBES  methods.  Outputs \nunder this component will include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsound and sustainable road maintenance policies and practices; \n\nannual maintenance of rehabilitated roads;  \n\nprocedures established and tested for maintenance of provincial and secondary \nroads using conventional and LBES methods;  \n\nan  efficient  bidding  and  contracting  system  for  engaging  private  sector \ncontractors and communities in maintenance, plus training and supervision; and  \n\n(v) \n\nimproved project appraisal, management, supervision, and monitoring in MID. \n\n42. \nSubcomponent B1: Institutional and Management Systems. The Project will facilitate \nthe  transition  of  MID  to  an  asset  management  regime  by  (i)  strengthening  transport  policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory frameworks; (ii) increasing private sector participation; (iii) providing \njob  opportunities  for  communities;  and  (iv)  enhancing  performance  of  the  asset  management \norganization. A systematic approach to subproject prioritization will be established for appraisal, \nincluding  economic,  social,  and  environmental  evaluation.  Subsequent  design,  procurement, \n\n\fimplementation, and monitoring procedures also will be established. MID staff will be trained in \nall  these  aspects  to  develop  their  capability.  The  TPPU,  with  oversight  from  the  TTF,  will \ncoordinate complementary project and TA activities supported by ADB and other development \npartners.  The  TTF  was  established  to  oversee  improvement  in  efficiency  and  management  of \nthe road network, including the prioritization of projects to support the productive sectors. These \ninitiatives, which began with an ongoing TA (footnote 4), will be supported by the Project. \n\n43. \nSubcomponent  B2:  Financing.  Most  routine  maintenance  will  be  funded  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ordinary  recurrent  budget  and  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF).  During  the \ntransition  period,  while  the  Government  is  increasing  its  budget  allocations,  the  Project  will \nfinance routine maintenance on all rehabilitated roads. The Project also will help MID improve \nits financial management systems, provide training, and assist with implementation. \n\nSubcomponent  B3:  Labor-Based  Equipment  Supported  Maintenance  Program \n44. \nSupport.  For  basic  maintenance  works,  the  Project  will  establish  an  LBES  maintenance \nprogram.  Program  development  will  involve  a  review  of  (i)  previous  attempts  at  LBES,  labor-\nintensive,  and  modified  equipment-based  methods  in  Solomon  Islands  and  elsewhere;  (ii) \nhuman,  management,  and  equipment  resources;  and  (iii)  cultural  and  social  issues  that  might \ninfluence  implementation.  The  program  will  (i)  train  contractors  and  community  organizations; \n(ii) provide appropriate equipment; (iii) engage small contractors for routine maintenance;12 (iv) \nprovide  supervision  and  training  during  implementation;  (v)  conduct  a  needs  assessment  for \nprivate  equipment  pools  for  lease  or  hire;  and  (vi)  regularly  monitor  program  effectiveness, \nincluding  comparative  quality  and  costs  of  works  undertaken  by  the  technologies  involved,  to \nrefine  the  program  as  appropriate.  Following  evaluation  of  the  pilot  program,  maintenance \nfunding will be allocated for LBES and traditional methods as appropriate. A road maintenance \nspecialist will train contractors and community organizations.  \n\n45. \nComponent C: Project Management and Capacity Building. The project will provide \nproject management and capacity building through a project management and capacity building \nunit  (PMCBU)  that  will  plan,  assess,  design,  manage,  and  implement  the  road,  drainage,  and \nbridge  works  projects  under  Component  A.  This  unit  also  will  provide  the  advisory  assistance \nnecessary for Component B. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n46. \nADB,  AusAID,  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development  (NZAID) \njointly  prepared  the  Project  in  one  of  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  more  fragile  and  least  developed \nstates. This collaboration has yielded a number of special features that reflect the experiences, \nperspectives,  and  lessons  learned  by  the  Government  and  its  development  partners.  This  is \nreflected  in  the  attention  to  sustainability  through  longer-term  capacity  building  integrated  with \nproject  management  activities, \nto  maintenance  programs,  participatory \napproaches,  and  LBES  activities.  These  aspects  will  be  complemented  by  the  promotion  of \nprivate sector participation. \n\nimprovements \n\n47. \nThe  integration  of  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  with  the  PMCBU \nconsultancy  services  creates  economies  of  scale  that  permit  extended  capacity  building \ntypical  TA \nactivities  during \nimplementation  periods  of  1\u20132  years.13  In  addition  to  the  implementation  assistance  that  will \n\nimplementation\u2014well  beyond \n\nthe  5  years  of  project \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n12  Contract  packages  of  up  to  $50,000  are  envisaged  for  the  LBES  establishment  period  under  the  Project. \n\nEquipment will be provided through additional packages. \n\n13 ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department reports in related sectors support longer-term capacity building efforts as \n\na means of improving capacity building success.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nensure the works are performed efficiently and effectively, subsequent development and training \nin appropriate road and bridge maintenance systems are included in capacity building efforts.  \n\n48. \nApproximately 72 person-months of staff services from the Pacific Technical Assistance \nFacility  will  supplement  the  capacity  building  components  of  the  implementation  assistance. \nSpecialist services will include community development and consultation, transport planning and \neconomics,  and  asset  management  and  maintenance.  AusAID  will  provide  and  finance  these \nservices through a parallel arrangement. \n\n49. \nParticipatory  activities  have  had  an  important  role  in  the  preparation  of  the  Project, \nespecially  the  development  of  the  NTP  and  the  associated  action  plan  for  road  management \n(footnote 4). With the inclusion of community maintenance initiatives and the LBES pilot project, \nthe  Project  also  builds  upon  lessons  learned  by  other  development  partners,  and  expands  on \nthem  through  a  review  of  international  experience  with  LBES  approaches  (footnote  11).  Since \nprivate sector development, including private sector participation in the delivery of infrastructure, \nis a key feature of ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy,14 the Project will develop MID capacity to outsource \nits  functions,  and  prepare  the  private  sector  to  undertake  road  and  highway  operations  and \nmaintenance.  NZAID\u2019s  strategies  to  promote  local  contractor  participation  in  contracting \noperations also are reflected in project procurement, as feasible under ADB guidelines. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  require  an  investment  of  $16.85  million.

Manila. \n\n\fE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n51. \nThe Government has requested a grant of $0.35 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development \nFund  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  Government  of  Australia  will  provide  a  grant  of  $6.10 \nmillion  and  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  will  provide  a  grant  of  $9.75  million.  ADB  will \nadminister  all  financing,  which  will  finance  all  costs  of  civil  works  and  consulting  services. \nWithdrawals from the Grant Account will be made on the basis of 100% of eligible expenditures \nfor each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by the grant. The Government of \nSolomon  Islands  will  provide  $0.65  million  to  finance  the  local  costs  of  project  administration. \nThe detailed financing plan is in Appendix 4, and is summarized in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Australia \nGovernment of New Zealand \nGovernment of Solomon Islands \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTotal Cost \n0.35 \n6.10 \n9.75 \n0.65 \n16.85 \n\nPercent \n2.08 \n36.20 \n57.86 \n3.86 \n100.00 \n\nProject Management \n\n1. \nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be MID. The Government\u2019s TTF15 will serve as \n52. \nthe project steering committee, overseeing and monitoring all aspects of project implementation, \nincluding (i) policy guidance and coordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study and selection, (iii) \nproject  progress  reports  and  other  project  documentation,  (iv)  annual  reports  on  road \nmaintenance  budgets  and  activities,  and  (v)  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements.  The \nPMCBU,  directed  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  MID,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation. Given MID\u2019s limited technical staff resources, a consulting firm will be retained \nfor  these  services.16  A  professionally  qualified  civil  engineer  with  appropriate  road  project \ntechnical  specialists, \nmanagement  experience  will  head \nadministrative  staff,  and  accounting  services.  The  PMCBU  will  be  fully  integrated  with  MID \nprofessional and technical staff as counterparts.  \n\nthe  PMCBU,  supported  by \n\nThe  PMCBU  will  (i)  conduct  subproject \n\n53. \nfeasibility  documentation,  design,  and \nsupervision;  (ii)  manage  tendering  processes;  (iii)  manage  contracts;  (iv)  prepare  withdrawal \napplications; (v) prepare project progress reports and a project completion report; (vi) maintain \nproject  accounts  and  complete  grant  financial  records  for  auditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic impacts; (vii) train MID staff and build their project implementation capacity; and \n(viii)  complete  related  project  management  activities,  as  necessary  to  implement  the  Project \nsuccessfully  and  comply  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 8. \n\n                                                 \n15  The  TTF  is  chaired  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Planning  and  includes  the  Permanent \nSecretaries  of  the  Departments  of  Infrastructure  and  Development,  Provincial  Development,  and  Finance  and \nTreasury as members. The MID Transport Policy and Planning Unit acts as the TTF secretariat. The Governments \nof Australia and New Zealand are also members by invitation of Government in recognition of their key role. \n16 See Component C and the Special Features section for information on additional capacity building activities. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n54. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years. Recruitment of the PMCBU consultants, \ninitiated  after  appraisal, will  be  completed  by  September  2006.  Other  preparatory  activities  for \ninitial works will be completed by September 2007, including feasibility studies, detailed design, \ntender  documentation,  award  of  contract,  and  mobilization.  Rehabilitation  activities,  which  will \nbegin soon after mobilization in October 2007, will be completed by the end of 2010. The grant \nis  scheduled  to  close  by  the  end  of  June  2011.  This  time  frame  takes  into  account  the  wet \nseason  and  appropriate  construction  periods  for  remote  locations.  Capacity  building  and  the \ncommunity awareness program will be undertaken over the entire project period (2006\u20132011). \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.   \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement under the Project, including ADB and the Government-financed packages, \n55. \nwill follow ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines.17 Civil works will be divided into packages. One major \npackage will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) and four small packages \nwill  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding,  shopping,  or  community  procurement \nprocedures.  A  number  of  packages  for  maintenance  contracts,  to  be  determined  during \nimplementation,  will  also  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding,  shopping,  or \ncommunity  procurement  procedures.  ICB  procedures  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  of \nmore than $1 million, while national competitive bidding will be used for civil works contracts up \nto $1,000,000 and shopping procedures for contracts up to $100,000. Community participation \ncontracts  will  not  exceed  $50,000.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  less  than  $300,000  will  be \nprocured  using  limited  international  bidding  procedures.  Goods  and  equipment  valued  up  to \n$100,000 will be procured using the shopping method. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \nTechnical  and  financial  qualifications  of  contractors  will  be  reviewed  in  conjunction  with  the \nreview of the bid proposals. Contractors might be awarded more than one contract based on the \nleast-cost  combination  of  contracts.  Evaluation  of  ICB  contracts  will  include  a  margin  of \npreference for domestic contractors as specified in ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n56. \nConsulting services  will  be  required  to  set  up  the  PMCBU,  which  will handle  (i)  project \nmanagement; (ii) institutional strengthening and capacity building; and (iii) feasibility studies of \nsubprojects,  detailed  engineering  design,  and  supervision.  All  items  will  be  combined  into  a \nsingle  consultancy.  The  Project  will  fund  approximately  136  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 278 person-months of national consulting services, provided by a firm. \nSpecialist services to be recruited include road and bridge engineering, contract management, \nprocurement,  construction  management,  community  development,  asset  management, \nmaintenance, accounting, and transport planning. A provisional sum is included for recruitment \nof  other  technical  specialists  under  the  same  consultancy,  if  needed.18  The  outline  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 8.  \n\n57. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  the  use  of \nconsultants.19 At the request of the Government, ADB will recruit the PMCBU consultants. Given \nthe  challenges  of  attracting  firms  to  weakly  performing  countries  and  remote  locations, \nengagement of consultants using ADB\u2019s quality-based selection method based on full technical \nproposals is justified.   \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n\f5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n58. \nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nThe  disbursement  procedures  will  include  direct  payments  and  reimbursements.  The  PMCBU \nwill open and maintain a dedicated imprest account in a domestic bank. The maximum amount \nin  the  account  will  be  10%  of  the  total  grant  or  the  equivalent  to  6  months  of  expenditures, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  initial  amount  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \n$300,000 equivalent. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement \nof  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidation  of  imprest  account  expenses,  and  is  applicable  to \nindividual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Direct  payments  will  be \nencouraged for most civil works and consulting services. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nReports. MID, with assistance from the PMCBU, will submit to ADB quarterly progress \n59. \nreports  on  preconstruction  activities  and  construction  of  civil  works,  including  (i)  physical  and \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),20  (iii) \nfinancial  progress,  (ii)  status  of \nenvironmental  management,  (iv)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  (v)  public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (vi)  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that will \ncover  implementation  details,  costs  and  benefits,  and  any  other  information  that  ADB  might \nrequire.  The  Government  will  provide  annual  reports  on  road  maintenance  budgets,  activities, \nand  expenditures.  In  coordination  with  the  institutional  strengthening  TA  (footnote  4),  the \nGovernment will advise ADB on progress in approving and implementing road transport sector \npolicy initiatives, regulations, cost recovery, and legal reforms.  \n\n60. \nAccounts  and  Audits.  MID,  with  assistance  from  the  PMCBU,  will  maintain  separate \nrecords  and  accounts  that  will  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant,  the \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  counterpart  funds.  The  project  accounts \nwill  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \npractices  that  will  follow  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  External  auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the accounts and annual financial statements annually. The audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the grant proceeds and compliance with \nthe  financial  covenants  included  in  the  grant  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  will \nprovide  ADB  with  the  annual  audited  financial  statements,  audited  project  accounts,  audit \nreports, management letters, and other related statements no later than 6 months after the end \nof each fiscal year throughout the implementation period.  \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n61. \n MID  and  PMCBU  will  establish  a  project  performance  and  monitoring  system  within  6 \nmonths  of  grant  effectiveness.  ADB  and  the  Government,  in  consultation  with  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners,  will  agree  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project \nperformance in achieving its goals and purposes. These indicators will be refined and monitored \nduring  project  implementation.  Guidelines  for  baseline  values  for  subprojects,  data  collection \nand analysis, and periods for future monitoring  are in Appendix 11. The indicators will include \ndata  for  monitoring  economic  development,  transport  sector  performance,  socioeconomic \ndevelopment,  environmental  impacts,  maintenance,  and  institutional  development.  Monitoring \nand  evaluation  will  be  based  on  gender  disaggregated  data  for  social  and  poverty  impact \nindicators.  The  PMCBU  will  provide  hands-on  training  to  the  domestic  consultants  and  TPPU \n                                                 \n20  As  indicated  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (Appendix  9),  neither  land  acquisition  nor \n\nresettlement is expected to be necessary. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nstaff on data collection, monitoring, and evaluation. This will allow monitoring to be maintained \nin the future. The PMCBU will monitor and evaluate the Project\u2019s progress annually, and provide \na final report within 6 months of the end of the contract period. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nADB and the Government, with AusAID and NZAID invited to participate, will undertake \nregular  review  missions  (approximately  every  6  months)  and  a  midterm  review  about  2  years \nafter  project  inception.  The  reviews  will  evaluate  in  detail  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  and  other  relevant  aspects of  the  Project  (including institutional,  administrative, \norganizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and \nfinancial assets) that might affect project performance, viability, and achievement of scheduled \ntargets. \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n63. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with the Government and \nthe EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the \nbidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  ADB-financed  contracts  for  the  Project  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe Project. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n64. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  directly  the  rural  population,  many  of  whom  are  poor  and \nextremely poor, through better access and decreased travel time to markets and social services. \nGovernment agencies and private sector companies that use the roads to deliver products and \nservices will benefit similarly. The estimated benefits to these groups, as well as other impacts, \nassumptions, and risks, are described in this section.   \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n65. \nRehabilitated  roads  will  improve  accessibility  for  rural  populations.  Direct  benefits  will \ninclude  travel  time  savings,  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  and  fuel  use,  and  reduced \npassenger  travel  and  freight  charges  (e.g.,  shifting  from  sea  transport  to  road  transport). \nRehabilitated  roads  are  likely  to  generate  more  traffic,  promote  more  agricultural  production, \nand  create  local  employment  during  their  construction  and  maintenance.  Rehabilitated  roads \nalso will create greater access to social services, including education and health. Lower costs \nfor routine maintenance will allow the Government to maintain more of the network and extend \nsimilar benefits to a greater proportion of the rural population. \n\n66. \nEconomic  benefits  from  transport  cost  savings  will  flow  to  the  areas  served.  Benefits \nfrom lower freight transport costs will be divided between producers, consumers, and transport \noperators. Since market prices are unlikely to fall substantially, most such benefits probably will \naccrue to producers. Prices for goods imported to subproject areas might fall. \n\n67. \nThe  NTP  (footnote  4),  which  is  based  on  a  least-cost  approach  to  achieving \ndevelopment  objectives,  identifies  the  Government\u2019s  prioritized  list  of  potential  subprojects. \nEconomic evaluations of subprojects will be carried out using the principles of the World Bank\u2019s \nRoads  Economic  Decision  Model,  including  economic  internal  rates  of  return  and  sensitivity \nanalyses.  The  evaluations  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  that  subprojects  are  economically \n\n\fjustifiable,  with  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  at  least  12%.  They  also  will  be  used  to \nprioritize individual subprojects. Economic criteria are in Appendix 5. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact  \n\n68. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  improving  people\u2019s  access  to  local  and  provincial \nmarkets,  agricultural  fields,  water  supplies,  and  firewood,  thereby  offering  income  generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the project. \nDuring  implementation,  employment  will  be  created  in  construction  and  maintenance  for  civil \nworks.  Following  completion,  employment  opportunities  will  arise  for  routine  maintenance \nconduced  through  LBES  and  traditional  methods.  By  reducing  the  cost  and  time  of  travel, \ninducing  economic  activities,  and  employing  people  directly,  the  Project  will  improve  people\u2019s \nincomes and food security. \n\n69. \nDuring the poverty and social analysis of  the subprojects, the economic impacts of the \nProject on the poor and non-poor will be assessed using secondary and field data. Distributional \nanalysis  will  not  be  needed  unless  the  initial  assessment  is  considered  insufficient,  and  if  the \nextra data collection and analysis required for distributional analysis is considered worthwhile. A \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  9,  while  a  social  and  poverty \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n70. \nPositive social impacts potentially include improved access to education facilities, which \nwill  help  raise  school  enrolment  and  retention  rates,  and  improved  access  to  health  services, \nwhich  will  promote  more  frequent  use  and  facilitate  rapid  care  during  medical  emergencies. \nOther  social  benefits  include  easier  access  to  administrative  and  service  centers,  including \ncommunication facilities. \n\nPotential  adverse  impacts  include  hazards  to  pedestrians,  particularly  from  increased \n71. \nand faster traffic flows brought about by road rehabilitation. A higher risk of HIV/AIDS is another \npotential adverse impact, since the road transport sector is a vector for transmission. However, \nthese  risks  are  small  due  to  low  population  densities  and  short  travel  distances  that  do  not \nrequire overnight stops by service providers or travelers.  \n\n72. \nGender Inclusive Development. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject level will \nbe  gender  disaggregated.  It  will  take  into  account  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks \nfacing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \nThe  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the road safety activities.  \n\nPublic  Health  Issues.  While  the  reported  number  of  infections  remains  low,  Solomon \n73. \nIslands  is  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS.  Risk  factors  include  the  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  teenage  pregnancy,  gender  inequality  and  violence  against  women,  recent  violent \nsocial  conflict,  and  cultural  and  religious  factors.  Transport  systems  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment are recognized internationally as a vector for HIV transmission. Several HIV/AIDS \nprevention  and  treatment  programs  and  projects  are  active  in  the  Pacific  region  and  Solomon \nIslands.  HIV/AIDS education and prevention will be integrated into the Project through links to \ndomestic and externally funded projects and a regional ADB project (Supplementary Appendix \nG).  Construction  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  their  crew  and  communities  access  to \neducation and control programs. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nStakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  Under  ADB  TA  (footnote  4),  MID  is \n74. \nconducting  a  series  of  population  and/or  accessibility  field  surveys  along  road  corridors  of \ninfluence (COI) that allow transport users\u2019 priorities and needs to be incorporated into the NTP. \nAs  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  subprojects,  extensive  consultations  will  be \nundertaken  in  each  subproject  location  with  (i)  resource  owners,  (ii)  households,  (iii)  the  poor \nand  non-poor,  (iv)  females  and  males,  (v)  young  and  old,  (vi)  the  disabled,  (vii)  community-\nbased and nongovernment organizations, (viii) transport service providers and users, (ix) local \ncontractors,  and  (x)  provincial  and  subprovincial  governments.  The  TTF,  assisted  by  the \nPMCBU,  is  expected  to  establish  local  consultative  groups,  which  will  serve  as  the  primary \ncontact  point  between  the  Project  and  communities  in  the  COI  on  project-related  matters, \nincluding recruitment of labor and access to aggregates. \n\nResettlement  Impacts.  The  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require \n75. \nresettlement or land acquisition, as all works will be undertaken on existing roads within existing \nrights-of-way. \n\n76. \nIndigenous  People.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the \npopulation,  are  the  indigenous  people  of  Solomon  Islands.  For  the  indigenous  population,  the \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  improve  access  to  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social \nservices.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.21  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n77. \nThe Project is classified as environmental category B, as all road improvement activities \nwill  be  confined  to  existing  rights-of-way,  and  neither  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement  will  be \nrequired.  Field  surveys  of  sample  subprojects  were  conducted  to  help  assess  environmental \nimpacts of the Project. A summary initial environmental examination (IEE) of the sector project, \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines,22 is in Appendix 10. \nimpact  assessment \nADB\u2019s  assessment  procedure \nrequirements of the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1998). \n\nthe  environmental \n\nis  aligned  with \n\n78. \nAn  IEE  has  been  conducted  for  a  sample  subproject  to  develop  the  methodology  for \nenvironmental  assessment  of  subprojects,  as  well  as  an  environmental  assessment  review \nprocess (EARP). The sample subproject IEE findings support the classification of the Project as \ncategory B.  \n\n79. \nSubproject environmental selection criteria will ensure that the Project will not harm any \necologically  or  culturally  sensitive  areas.  The  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures, \nstabilization  of  slopes  through  bioengineering,  and  other  measures  undertaken  by  the  Project \nwill  have  long-term  beneficial  impacts  on  the  environment.  Short-term  impacts  will  be \nunavoidable during construction. These might include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts, \nsuch as loss of vegetation due to earth moving, and minor sedimentation of waterways and the \ncoastal environment near the shore. These impacts will end with the completion of rehabilitation \nworks, and methods specified in the environmental management plan (EMP) will mitigate them. \nAdherence  to  best  engineering  practices  during  rehabilitation,  and  strict  enforcement  of  the \nEMP, will avoid or adequately mitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts.  \n\n80. \nEach subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific EMP \nprepared  under  the  responsibility  of  the  PMCBU.  The  EMP  will  specify  the  required  mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring activities to ensure their effectiveness.   \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n\fE. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements  \n\n81. \nThe  road  sector  institutional  development  component  supported  by  the  Project  will \nadvance  the  objectives  of  Government  policy  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  public  services \ndelivery. It also will create participation opportunities for the private sector contracting industry \nthrough performance-based maintenance contracts, as well as smaller LBES construction and \nrehabilitation packages.  \n\nF. \n\nProject Risks and Safeguards  \n\n82. \n\nThe risks and safeguards related to the Project include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nresource  allocation  and \n\nTechnical  risks.  Underestimation  of \nimproper \nemployment  of  appropriate  construction  methods  and  equipment  might  cause \ndelays and increase costs. Limited availability of aggregates in some areas could \npose difficulties. The project design will mitigate these risks by (a) incorporating \nprovisions in tender documents for evidence of satisfactory past performance in \nsimilar conditions; (b) requiring a minimum level for provision of physical plant at \nrisks,  and  adequate \nmobilization,  detailed  quantification  of  engineering \ncontingencies  for  unforeseen  items;  and  (c)  holding  community  consultations \nadvance,  with  Government  support,  on  subproject  selection  and  for  access  to \nresources. \n\nFinancial  risks.  Grant-financed  budgetary  allocations  for  the  Project  could  be \ninadequate  as  a  result  of  underestimated  construction  costs,  more-than-routine \nsupervision of contractors, inflation during implementation, and the potential cost \nof  defending  construction  claims  lodged  by  contractors.  To  mitigate  these  risks, \nthe  PMCBU  will  (a)  use  conservative  cost  estimates,  (b)  prepare  some \nsubprojects for concurrent implementation to absorb additional funding in case of \nslower-than-forecasted  implementation,  (c)  use  strict  and  effective  contract \nconditions  to  mitigate  slow  contractor  performance,  (d)  develop  measures  to \nmitigate  uninsurable  risks  during  preparation  of  the  contract  documentation  to \nlimit the employer\u2019s exposure, and (e) require a guarantee by the contractor for \none  year  following  rehabilitation  to  ensure  construction  quality.  Government \nbudgetary  allocations  for  restructuring,  road  maintenance,  and  counterpart  staff \ncould  be  inadequate  due  to  poor  national  financial  management.  Ongoing \nprograms  supported  by  development  partners  are  strengthening  Government \nbudgetary processes, financial management systems, and provincial governance \nand will thus improve the environment for project implementation and institutional \ncapacity building. The Government is expected to increase recurrent budgets for \nmaintenance  progressively  to  protect  investments  in  road  infrastructure.  The \nongoing  TA  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project  will  mitigate  the  internal \nfinancial risks associated with the need to improve its financial systems.  \n\nInstitutional reforms and sector restructuring risks. Progress in restructuring \nMID and developing its management systems to transform itself into a planning \nand  asset  management  agency  depends  on  successful  ADB  TA  and  adequate \nGovernment  funding.  One  risk  is  that  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the \nreform process, and associated development and implementation of operational \nand  management  procedures,  could  wane.  The  approach  also  relies  on  a \ndedicated  source  of  funding  for  road  maintenance  and  investment,  supplied \nthrough  the  NTF.  Further  risks  include  the  Government  not  progressing  with \ntimely  legal  and  institutional  reforms,  and  resource  shortages  within  MID.  The \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nproject design mitigates these risks through close collaboration and cooperation \nwith the ongoing TA, which involves consultations between Government, private \nsector,  and  public.  ADB  project  and  TA  review  missions,  as  well  country \nconsultation  missions,  will  engage  in  regular  dialogue  to  maintain  support  and \ncommitment. ADB also will continue to work closely with development partners to \npromote sector governance improvements. \n\nLand  and  material  acquisition  risks.  Landowners  and  rural  populations  are \nexpected  to  welcome  road  rehabilitation  for  social  and  economic  benefits. \nExisting  practice  in  Solomon  Islands  is  for  local  landowners  to  grant  access  for \naggregates  as \ntheir  counterpart  contribution.  Clear  Government  and \ndevelopment partner policies regarding counterpart contributions mitigate the risk \nof demands for compensation.  \n\nPost-conflict  environment  risks.  The  post-conflict  environment  is  stable,  and \nthe  economy  has  recovered  substantially.  The  business  environment \nis \nincreasingly  positive,  as  contractors  and  consultants  respond  to  business \nopportunities.  If  political  instability  increases  or  the  peace  and  order  situation \ndeteriorates,  prospective  bidders  might  have  less  interest  in  the  Project, \nincreasing  tender  prices.  This  also  could  reduce  community  support  for  the \nProject.  Continuing  assistance  by  development  partners  that  is  both  large  in \nscope and long term, to help the Government with its economic and post-conflict \nrecovery efforts, mitigates this risk. \n\n83. \nAn analysis of the project risks shows the economic benefits to be robust, and adverse \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts  not  to  be  significant  and  capable  of  mitigation.  Cost  and \nimplementation  risks  will  be  managed  carefully  through  the  proposed  approach  to  contractor \nprequalification,  contract  conditions,  financial  incentives,  and  penalties  to  avoid  the  late \nperformance problems of previous projects. Overall, the risks are sufficiently manageable to not \nconstitute barriers to project approval.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, Government has given the following assurances, \n\n84. \nwhich will be incorporated in the Grant Agreement: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCounterpart  staffing  and  support.  The  Government  will  ensure  counterpart \nstaff for the TPPU and Land Transport Division of MID are employed on a timely \nbasis  and  from  its  ordinary  budgetary  allocations,  and  ensure  that  MID  has \nadequate budget to maintain staffing and support its routine operations, including \nper diem and local transport for staff participating in field activities.   \n\nProject  management.  Within  3  months  of  the  grant  effectiveness  date,  the \nGovernment,  through  MID,  and  assisted  by  ADB  in  consultant  selection,  will \nestablish the PMCBU and will provide office space, utilities, counterpart staff, and \ntelecommunications for the PMCBU. \n\nSubproject  Selection.  Prior  to  the  detailed  design  of  any  subproject,  the \nGovernment will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for \nfinancing under the Project, based on the agreed appraisal and selection criteria. \n\nRoad maintenance policy. The Government, assisted by PMCBU, will establish \nmaintenance  policies  for  the  road  sector,  including  budget  and  implementation \narrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  by  December  2006.  The  Government  will \nensure  that  its  budget  allocation  for  road  maintenance  is  increased  to  at  least \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n$1.6  million  for  fiscal  year  2007,  and  increased  by  20%  per  annum  in  each \nsubsequent year of the Project. Within 1 year of the grant effectiveness date, the \nGovernment will establish a special fund (described in the proposal as a National \nTransport  Fund,  or  equivalent)  to  ensure  availability  of  these  increased \nallocations. \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that all project \nrehabilitation  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  rights-of-way.  In  the  event  of \nany  unforeseen  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the  Government  will \ninform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  relevant  laws  and \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  PMCBU \nwill  ensure  that  no  construction  activities  begin  until  ADB  has  reviewed  and \napproved such resettlement plan. \n\nEnvironment. No project assessed as Category A (significant adverse impacts) \nwill  be  approved  under  the  Project.  The  Government,  through  the  PMCBU,  will \nensure  that  (a)  the  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  and  preliminary \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  are  reviewed  and  updated  at  the \nengineering design stage; (b) the Project complies with the EMP reflected in the \nupdated  IEE,  all  applicable  national  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and \nguidelines,  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (c)  the  EMP  is  reflected  as \npart  of  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (d)  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project  are  minimized  by  implementing \nthe  agreed  mitigating  measures;  and  (e)  environmental  monitoring  is  done  by \nPMCBU and contractors. \n\n(vii)  Gender  and  employment.  The  Government,  through  the  PMCBU,  will  (a) \nencourage project contractors to employ women in road rehabilitation and labor-\nintensive maintenance of selected national roads; (b) provide equal pay to men \nand  women  for  work  of  equal  type,  in  accordance  with  national  laws  and \ninternational treaty obligations; (c) provide safe working conditions for male and \nfemale  workers;  and  (d)  ensure  that  project  contractors  comply  with  applicable \nlabor laws, and abstain from child labor. Specific provisions to this effect will be \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents.  The  PMCBU  will  be  responsible  for \nmonitoring  the  employment  targets  for  women  by  reviewing  periodically  the \npayroll  statements  of  the  construction  contractors,  and  will  reflect  progress  in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n\n(viii)  Health  risks.  The  Government,  through  the  PMCBU,  will  ensure  that  all  civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  participate  in  an  HIV/AIDS \nprevention program to be funded under the Project in construction campsites. In \naddition,  the  PMCBU  will  ensure  that  similar  information  on  the  risk  of \ntransmission  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually \nis \ndisseminated  to  local  communities  in  the  corridor  of  influence,  in  coordination \nwith  national  agencies  working  on  this  issue.  The  PMCBU  will  include  specific \nprovisions  to  this  effect  in  civil  works  contracts,  and  will  strictly  monitor \ncompliance. \n\ntransmitted  diseases \n\n(ix) \n\nProject performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 6 months of the grant \neffectiveness  date,  the  EA  shall  finalize  and  adopt  a  project  performance  and \nmonitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  indicators  and  procedures \nagreed between the Government and ADB. The EA shall monitor the indicators \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\faccording  to  the  agreed  framework  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  determine  the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  Project,  and  shall  provide  to  ADB  biannual \nmonitoring  reports  from  the  commencement  of  project  implementation  until \nproject  completion,  and  thereafter  on  an  annual  basis  for  the  first  5  years  after \nproject completion. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n85. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $350,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the \nRoad  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  upon \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement submitted to the Board herewith;  \nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $6,100,000 \nto Solomon Islands for the Project to be provided by the Government of Australia; \nand  \nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $9,750,000 \nto  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  New \nZealand. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n17 July 2006 \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nImpact \n\nEconomic growth and \npoverty reduction \n\n\u2022 Development partners\u2019 \n\n\u2022 Sufficient political stability \n\nAssumptions \n\n\u2022 A 20% increase in job \nopportunities in the \nproject area by \ncompletion \n\n\u2022 A 20% increase in \n\nincome in the project \narea by completion \n\ncountry reports \n\n\u2022 Socioeconomic monitoring \n\nreports \n\n\u2022 Household income and \nexpenditure survey \n\nOutcome \n\n1.

The network comprises 390 km of main roads, 455 km of secondary roads, 425 km of \nprovincial  roads,  120  km  of  Honiara  Town  roads,  and  about  560  km  of  private  and  plantation \naccess  roads.  The country  has  an  estimated  800  km  of  logging  roads. The  road  network  also \nhas about 185 bridges. Sea is the dominant mode of transport in Solomon Islands. The Ministry \nof  Infrastructure  and  Development  (MID)  manages  the  main  and  secondary  roads,  while  the \nprovincial governments manage the provincial roads.   \n\n2. \nAbout  60%  of  the  network  is  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita,  which  serves  about  90%  of \nthe  traffic  in  the  country.  About  1,570  km  have  a  graveled  surface  and  about  100  km  of  main \nroads, mostly on Guadalcanal and Malaita, and 30 km of Honiara Town roads are sealed. Other \nprovinces  have  relatively  short  coastal  segments  of  gravel  or  earth  roads  around  provincial \ncenters. Compared to other Pacific nations, the road density is low: Solomon Islands has less \nthan  0.07  km  per  square  kilometer  and  only  0.005  km  per  capita.  About  23%  of  villages  are \naccessible by road (normally by cars or trucks), 32% by sea, 40% by walking tracks, and 5% by \nriver.   \n\nThe  main  roads  serve  the  densely  populated  areas  linking  the  main  centers  with \n3. \ncommercial centers, markets, and main ports.  The secondary roads are extensions to the main \nroad network, or serve provincial and subprovincial centers and rural communities on the main \nislands.  Provincial  roads  serve  a  similar  function  to  secondary  roads.  They  also  connect \nagricultural  areas  and  villages  to  wharves,  and  provide  access  to  social  services,  including \nschools, clinics, and markets.   \n\n4. \nMain,  secondary,  and  provincial  roads  were  not  built  to  high  standards  and  have \nsuffered  from  years  of  neglect.  As  a  result,  the  condition  of  the  network  is  poor.  It  provides \ninadequate  rural  access,  thereby  constraining  economic  growth  and  development,  poverty \nreduction, and social development. In rural areas, the potential of agriculture production of cash \ncrops is underdeveloped primarily due to irregular farm-to-market access, which leaves much of \nthe rural population reliant on subsistence livelihoods. Resource-based industries also rely on a \nsuitable standard of roads for marketing their production for export. \n\n5. \nAbout  80%  of  roads  have  deteriorated  to  such  an  extent  that  damage  to  vehicles  is \nexcessive, and the roads are impassable by cars and light trucks. Roads surfaces are deformed \nand  eroded,  drainage  is  not  working,  and  vegetation  is  overgrown.  Many  log  bridges  have \nexceeded  their  design  life,  with  only  about  25%  remaining  in  good  condition,  30%  requiring \nminor  repairs,  37%  requiring  major  repairs,  and  8%  not  open  to  traffic.  The  poor  condition  of \nmany  roads  has  lowered  traveling  speeds,  while  increasing  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle \noperating costs. The rough road surfaces also have reduced the economic lives of the vehicles, \nand suppressed road transport demand. \n\n6. \nDevelopment  partners  are  assisting  with  rehabilitation  road  and  bridge  works  in  areas \nworst affected by several years of conflict (1999\u20132003), and with the restoration of some wharf \nfacilities throughout the country. However, much more needs to be done urgently. \n\nB. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\nSolomon Islands has approximately 11,000 vehicles, 90% of which are on Guadalcanal \n7. \n(75%  in  the  capital  Honiara),  8%  in  Malaita,  1%  in  Western,  and  the  remaining  1%  in  other \nprovinces. Private cars, light trucks, and medium trucks (up to 8 tons, 2 axles) are the dominant \nvehicle  types.  Larger  multi-axle  and  articulated  trucks  are  rare  except  in  Honiara  and  specific \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmining  and  logging  areas.  The  fleet  of  large  trucks  in  Guadalcanal  is  forecast  to  increase \nconsiderably over the next few years with the development of mining and oil palm activities. This \nmight  result  in  axle  loads  of  up  to  11  tons  (dual-tired)  and  up  to  8  tons  on  single-tired  axles. \nAppropriate  axle  load  legislation  must  be  enforced.  Motorcycles,  motor  scooters,  and  bicycles \nare not common in Solomon Islands.    \n\n8. \nThe primary cause of road deterioration in Solomon Islands is the high rainfall, combined \nwith poor road construction, poor drainage, and lack of maintenance. Maintenance of drains is \nessential  in  areas  of  high  rainfall  and  in  steep  areas.  Heavy  axle  loads,  the  primary  cause  of \nroad damage in other countries, are not common in Solomon Islands, except on a few mining \nand logging roads. However, with the increase in heavy vehicles in some areas, the amount of \ndamage  is  likely  to  increase  unless  roads  are  properly  engineered  and  constructed  for  the \nhigher  loads,  and  laws  against  overloaded  vehicles  are  enforced.  The  weak  institutional  and \nabsorptive capacity of MID has made improvements more difficult. \n\nC. \n\nTransport Services \n\nThe  majority  of  vehicles  in  the  Solomon  Islands  are  privately  owned.  Privately  owned \n9. \nminibuses  and  taxis  are  the  leading  form  of  public  road  transport  in  Solomon  Islands, \nparticularly in Honiara. Little public transport is available outside of Honiara. Public transport in \nrural areas generally takes the form of light trucks that combine goods and passenger services. \nWalking is the most common form of travel for distances up to 10 km. A few small and medium-\nsized  private  operators  provide  all  the  freight  services.  In  Honiara,  a  few  companies  operate \nheavy  and  articulated  trucks,  and  carry  containers.  In  addition,  private  logging  trucks  provide \nservices  to  the  forestry  sector.  Although  fares  are  not  regulated,  market  forces  ensure  they \nreflect operating costs. \n\nD. \n\nRoad Safety \n\nFigures  obtained  from  MID  show  that  on  average  six  people  die  in  road  accidents  per \n10. \nyear  (1996  through  2003).  That  equates  to  a  rate  of  5  deaths  per  10,000  vehicles,  which  is \nrelatively  low  by  international  standards.  The  low  average  speeds  and  low  total  distance \ntraveled appear to contribute to this low road toll. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Framework  \n\n11. \nThe  institutional  framework  of  MID,  which  has  responsibility  for  road  management,  is \nevolving.  The  former  Ministry  of  Transport,  Works  and  Communications  was  transformed  in \n2001 into MID, which was divided into two departments\u2014the Department of Infrastructure and \nDevelopment and the Department of Communications Aviation and Meteorology, each with its \nown  minister  and  permanent  secretary.  Department  of  Infrastructure  and  Development  is \nresponsible for the management and development of the national road network. The creation of \nthe Transport Policy and Planning Unit (TPPU) in 2005 clarified responsibility for transport policy \nand planning.  \n\n12. \nAn ADB technical assistance (TA) is reviewing the organizational structure of MID with \nthe objectives of (i) enhancing its effectiveness and efficiency in asset management of transport \nmodes,  and  (ii)  meeting  the  overall  needs  of  transportation  service  providers  and  users.  This \nreview will include the role of the Mechanical and Workshops Division, which primarily services \nplant,  equipment,  and  vehicles  owned  by  the  Government.  However,  little  of  the  plant  and \nequipment  remains  serviceable.  The  Mechanical  and  Workshops  Division  is  most  active  in \ntesting the condition of privately owned vehicles (a certificate of roadworthiness is a prerequisite \nfor vehicle registration), and repairing and maintaining of government-owned vehicles. As these \nlatter activities relate to traffic regulation and safety, rather than to infrastructure, responsibility \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nfor  them  would  be  better  placed  within  the  Department  of  Communications  Aviation  and \nMeteorology  under  a  road  traffic  division  responsible  for  road  safety  issues,  as  well  as  road \ntraffic regulations and legislation. \n\n13. \nSimilarly,  the  responsibilities  of  the  Marine  Division  and  its  organizational  structure  are \nassociated more with maritime operations than with infrastructure. Therefore, the transfer of this \ndivision  to  Department  of  Communications  Aviation  and  Meteorology  is  being  considered. \nConcurrently,  responsibility  for  wharf  maintenance  and  development  then  should  be  vested \novertly  in  the  Land  Transport  Division  of  MID.  This  would  make  the  combination  of  wharf \nmaintenance works with road network maintenance easier, leading to cost savings in planning, \nprogramming, implementation, and supervision. \n\n14. \nTPPU  is  responsible  for  policy  preparation,  planning  and  programming  of  road  and \nbridge  works,  and  Land  Transport  Division  for  their  design  and  implementation.  The  TA,  in \nconsultation  with  MID,  is  reviewing  the  organizational  structures  of  the  TPPU  and  Land \nTransport Division, and will recommend changes. The existing structure of TPPU is considered \ninappropriate  for  its  responsibilities  as  a  policy  and  planning  unit  for  all  modes  of  transport \ninfrastructure. Similarly, the Land Transport Division\u2019s structure is not suited to implementing a \npolicy  of  outsourcing  maintenance  and  capital  works,  and  will  be  restructured  for  asset \nmanagement.  \n\nStaffing  and  recruitment  have  been  problematic  in  MID,  which  has  been  seeking \n15. \nadditional staff and recently filled five positions. Further recruitment is planned in 2006 for both \ndivisions. On-the-job training in planning, programming, budgeting, and project management is \ncontinuing  for  the  staff  in  these  two  divisions  under  ADB  TA.  MID  must  continue  to  seek \nadditional staff, and make full use of training offered by TA and under the proposed Project. \n\nF. \n\nGovernment Vision and Strategy  \n\n16. \nNational  Development  Plan.  The  Government\u2019s  development  vision,  priorities,  and \ndevelopment  strategies  are  articulated  in  the  National  Economic  Recovery,  Reform  and \nDevelopment Plan 2003\u20132006 (NERRDP). The overall national development goal of NERRDP \nis to enhance and improve the quality of life and living standards of all the people in Solomon \nIslands.  This  goal  is  to be  achieved  by  ensuring  peace,  harmony,  and  personal  safety  among \nthe people; increasing incomes and their equitable distribution; and increasing the availability of, \nand  improving  the  access  to,  social  service  for  everyone.  This  would  lead  to  equitable \ndistribution of development among all provinces and people within each province, social groups, \nand  genders.  Preferential  attention  would  be  given  to  the  disadvantaged  and  marginalized \ngroups  and  communities,  including  expansion  of  development  to  rural  areas.  The  immediate \nobjectives of NERRDP 2003\u20132006 are to (i) improve the security environment by restoring law \nand  order  and  fostering  peace,  (ii)  strengthen  and  improve  governance  institutions  and  good \ngovernance,  (iii)  achieve  macroeconomic  stability  and  income  growth,  (iv)  restore  basic  social \nservices  in  health  and  education,  and  (v)  reestablish  the  foundations  for  sustained  economic \ngrowth and human development. \n\n17. \nThe realization of these objectives hinges on increasing personal mobility and removing \nconstraints to the transportation of goods between areas of production and markets. Improving \nsecurity requires ensuring that law enforcement officers and justice administrators can respond \nquickly to emerging threats to peace and law compliance, as and where they occur. Effective, \nefficient,  and  transparent  governance  in  other  areas  of  governmental  administration  similarly \nrequires improved access within outlying areas of the country. Economic growth, particularly in \nthe  production  and  distribution  of  tradable  goods,  depends  on  adequate,  reliable,  affordable, \nand  secure  transportation.  Basic  health  and  education  facilities,  as  and  where  they  are  being \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nprovided,  will  be  effective  only  if  complementary  transport  infrastructure  and  services  are \ndeveloped that are accessible by a higher proportion of the population. \n\n18. \nThus, the improvement of transport infrastructure is fundamental to the realization of the \nNERRDP objectives. Transport improvements have an indirect impact on social and economic \ndevelopment,  and  play  a  supporting  role  to  the  direct  components  of  the  NERRDP  in  other \nsectors. Therefore, transport improvement and development must be made in concert with other \ndevelopments.  \n\nNational  Transport  Policy.  National  transport  policies  and  strategies  are  contained  in \n19. \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. Policies will focus immediately on the rehabilitation of transport \ninfrastructure in areas of most need. In the longer term, the Government\u2019s road sector policy will \nbe  to  (i)  restore  the  network  of  roads  and  bridges  to  conditions  that  promote  economic \ndevelopment and enhance social welfare and security; (ii) extend the scope of the maintainable \nroad network in accordance with socioeconomic criteria; (iii) establish an effective and efficient \nmaintenance  and  asset  management  system,  including  sustainable  funding;  (iv)  improve  the \nsafety,  quality,  and  reliability  of  transport  services;  (v)  promote  private  sector  consultation  on \npolicies  and  works  planning  and  programming;  (vi)  promote  private  sector  participation  in \ncontracting and service provision; (vii) encourage appropriate community participation; and (viii) \nprotect  the  social  and  environmental  standards,  and  the  interests  of  the  socially  and \neconomically disadvantaged. \n\n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  reconstruct  high-priority  roads  to  design  standards \nappropriate  to  the  traffic  and  topography.  Improvements  needed  include  repairs  and \nreplacement  of  bridges,  reshaping  and  strengthening  of  pavement,  and  improvement  to \ndrainage (additional culverts and cross drains). Feeder roads connecting village settlements and \nfarms  with  main  roads  also  should  be  considered  for  improvement.  The  Government,  through \ndevelopment  partners,  is  (i)  rehabilitating  high-priority  roads  and  bridges  in  Guadalcanal  and \nMalaita; (ii) strengthening the capacity and capability of MID to undertake project management, \ncontract management, contract supervision, and road asset management under the TA; and (iii) \nestablishing a dedicated transport fund with sustainable revenues from user charges. \n\n21. \nThe  Government\u2019s  limited  domestic  resources  dictate  that  external  agencies  will \ncontinue to fund most sector development. Similarly, the low capacity and capability of the local \nconstruction industry requires a heavy dependence on international consultants to carry out the \nworks. Asset management capability is being enhanced, enabling follow-up maintenance works \nto be carried out effectively and efficiently.   \n\nNational Transport Plan. The Transport Sector Strategy will be implemented according \n22. \nto  the  National  Transport  Plan  (NTP).  The  NTP  provides  the  framework  and  action  plan  for \ndeveloping and maintaining physical infrastructure, facilitating transport services, improving the \ncapacity of Government agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. The NTP, which \nwill  be  updated  every  5  years,  is  supported  by  a  3-year  rolling  work  program,  which  will  be \nupdated annually.  \n\n23. \nA national Transport Task Force (TTF) has been established to assist and advise on key \nissues and development options. The TTF comprises representatives of Government agencies \nresponsible  for  social  and  economic  planning  and  development,  and  representatives  of \ntransport users and transport service providers. The TTF endorsed the NTP in June 2006. \n\n24. \nA  key  element  of  the  NTP  is  its  assessment  of  the  priorities  for  rehabilitation, \nmaintenance,  and  investment  in  expansion  of  the  national  network  across  the  three  modes  of \nland, sea, and air transport. This assessment is based on the practicality of providing access by \nthe different modes of transport available in rural areas. The NTP decision framework is based \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\non assessments of (i) existing networks; (ii) technical feasibility of providing access by different \nmodes;  (iii)  positive  and  negative  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts;  and  (v)  the \nneed  for  connecting  infrastructure.  After  identifying  potential  subprojects,  they  were  prioritized \nbased  on  a  multicriteria  analysis  of  economic  benefits,  social  welfare  considerations, \nenvironmental impacts, and promotion of intercommunity peace and reconciliation. \n\n25. \nThe  NTP  contains  detailed  transport  sector  and  subsector  road  maps  for  all  modes  of \ntransport,  as  well  as  time-based  action  plans  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation  and \ndevelopment.  These  plans  detail  actions  required,  assign  responsibilities  for  implementation, \nand identify associated costs and proposed sources of funding. The methodology is based on a \nleast-cost  life  cycle  analysis  of  prioritized  subprojects,  as  well  as  a  full  analysis  of  the  road \nsector\u2019s  contribution  to  development  objectives  in  various  locations.  Since  the  plan  covers  all \nmodes of transport, alternatives to road rehabilitation are considered in this prioritization. \n\n26. \nThe  NTP  also  covers  organizational  reforms  and  human  resource  development \nprograms  to  ensure  capacity  is  in  place  during  the  planning  period.  The  NTP  is  intended  to \nembody sufficient flexibility to meet emerging needs, constraints, and opportunities. The NTP is \ndesigned  to  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  associated  with  development  partner  programs.  The  NTP \nwill be reviewed and updated periodically, incorporating new Government polices. \n\n27. \nSector  Finance  and  the  National  Transport  Fund.  The  Government  has  invested \nabout  $9.0  million  of  its  own  resources  and  $81  million  in  external  assistance  to  develop  the \nroad  sector  over  the  past  15  years  (Appendix  3).  Given  the  large  investment  needs  and \nconstrained public finances, the Government will continue to rely on external assistance for road \nrehabilitation and development. \n\nAbout  80%  of  the  road network  requires  reconstruction  due  to  neglected  maintenance. \n28. \nRoad maintenance funding has averaged $0.5 million since 1990, with a temporary drop of 80% \nto  an  average  of  $0.1  million  during  the  conflict  (1998\u20132002),  resulting  in  widespread \ndeterioration. Funding is significantly below the levels necessary to sustain current assets. What \nproportion  goes  toward  maintenance,  versus  public  sector  overhead  costs,  is  unclear  due  to \nlimited accountability. Maintaining the 20% of roads that remain in good or fair condition would \ncost  an  estimated  $1.55  million  annually\u2014three  times  the  current  allocation.  The  benefits  of \nroad  rehabilitation  will  not  be  realized  unless  a  comprehensive  maintenance  program  is \nimplemented. \n\n29. \n To  address  the  shortfall  in  maintenance  funding,  the  Government  is  setting  up  a \ndedicated  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF),  supported  by  ADB  TA.  The  NTF  initially  will  be \ncapitalized  through  an  expected  contribution  of  about  $13  million  from  the  European \nCommission.  The  Government  then  will  make  increasing  annual  contributions,  intended  to \neventually  match  sector  maintenance  needs.  The  NTF  also  will  raise  revenue  from  road  user \ncharges,  which  are  appropriate  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation.  The  anticipated \nmagnitude of the NTF will be sufficient to maintain all rehabilitated roads. \n\n30. \nIt has been proposed that an independent board, comprising a comprehensive range of \nstakeholders  from  the  Government  and  the  private  sector,  should  manage  the  NTF  based  on \nsound  business  principles.  If  the  proposal  is  accepted,  the  board  would  be  required  to  report \ntransparently  on  its  current  activities  and  future  plans.  The  operations  of  the  NTF  will  be \ndesigned  to  ensure  more  needs-related  funding,  as  well  as  a  more  reliable  flow  and  better \ndeployment of funding. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nG. \n\nMain Challenges and Issues \n\n31. \nGiven its involvement in road maintenance and rehabilitation, the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  plans  to  bring  in  about  $2.70  million  of  road  construction \nand  maintenance  plant  and  equipment  in  2006.  Options  for  deployment  include  (i)  MID \nownership  for  direct  use,  although  it  has  limited  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  a  plant;  (ii) \nMID ownership for lease to private contractors to enhance opportunities for the private sector; \n(iii) provincial government ownership and use, though they also have limited capacity to operate \nand maintain; or (iv) some combination of these options. AusAID and MID are evaluating these \noptions in the context of sector planning.  \n\n32. \nThe  Government  faces a  number  of  challenges regarding  road  transport  infrastructure: \n(i) resolving the scarcity and unreliability of budget allocations to the sector, (ii) recognizing that \nmaintenance  has  higher  priority  than  new  works,  and  (iii)  developing  asset  management \ncapability from planning to implementation. The major issues include (i) rehabilitating roads; (ii) \nmoving  from  a  reactive  to  a  preventive  maintenance  approach;  (iii)  increasing  spending  to \nmaintain the current road network; (iv) ensuring that road design recognizes life cycle costs; (v) \ninstituting sustainable arrangements for managing and maintaining roads; (vi) addressing social \nimpacts and community involvement; (vii) providing additional resources and skills for MID; and \n(viii)  addressing  the  likelihood  that,  for  many  years,  Government  will  be  unable  to  borrow  to \nfinance new investments due to its high debt.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR, 1990\u20132005 \n\nFunding \nAgency \n\nLoan or \nTA No. \n\nProject Description \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nADB \n \n \n\n6.50\n18.50\n0.70\n\n0704 \n1823 \n4494 \n\nGuadalcanal Road Improvement Projecta\nPost-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Projectb\nInstitutional Strengthening of Ministry of Infrastructure \nand Development \nMataniko and Phoha Bridges \nCommunity Sector Project \nSasamunga-Papara Road Rehabilitation Project \nTransport Sector Strategy \nChoiseul Road Improvement Project \nStructural Adjustment Program for MID \nMakira Road Improvement Project \nMalaita Road Maintenance Project \nMalaita Rural Infrastructure Project \nSolomon Islands Rural Transport Project \nCyclone Nina Emergency Rehabilitation Project \nLunnga Bridge  \nMetapono & Alligator Bridges  \nWhite River, Bonege & Tanaeba Bridges \nCommunity Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \nLabor-Based Road Maintenance Projectc\nHoniara Main Road Upgrading Project I \nHoniara Main Road Upgrading Project IId\nWeathercoast Road Improvement Project \nNoro-Munda Road Rehabilitation Project \nGizo Road Upgrading Project \n \n\n2.00\nGrant \nAusAID \n1.00\nGrant \n \n0.25\nGrant \nEED \n0.45\nGrant \nEU \n0.30\nGrant \n \n0.80\nGrant \n \n0.15\nGrant \n \n0.10\nGrant \n \n7.00\nGrant \n \n4.00\nGrant \n \n1.00\nGrant \n \n5.82\nGrant \nJapan \n6.72\nGrant \n \n7.45\nGrant \n \n0.50\nGrant \n \nGrant \n \n0.46\n7.50\nLoan \n \nKFAED \nLoan \n9.23\n0.20\nTaipei,China  Grant \n0.10\nGrant \n \n0.30\nGrant \n \n \nTotal \n81.03\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, EED = Evangelischer \nEntwicklungsdienst, EU = European Union, KFAED = Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, TA = technical \nassistance, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme. \na  Amount  includes  cofinancing  loans  from  International  Development  Association  of  World  Bank  ($2.0  million), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development ($1.5 million), and Government \nof Solomon Islands ($1.0 million). \n\nb  Amount  includes  cofinancing  grants  from  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  in  the  amounts  of  $2.0 \n\nmillion and $6.5 million, respectively. \n\nc   Financed by Japan and executed by UNDP via subcontract with the International Labor Organization. \nd  Amount  includes  cofinancing  loans  from  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment ($1.73 million), and Government of Solomon Islands $1.20 million. \n\nSource: Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Government of Solomon Islands. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ \u2018000) \n\nCost \n\n  \n\n \n\nFinancing\n \n\n \n\nADB \n  \n\nAustralia \n  \n\n \nNew Zealand Government \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n3\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\n \nItem  \n \nA.

Subprojects will be selected based on agreed \neligibility criteria (section B).  \n\nRoads to be rehabilitated are mostly gravel and earthen roads, with a small proportion \n2. \nthat  are  sealed,  which  have  deteriorated  to  such  an  extent  that  patching  is  ineffective  and \nuneconomical  to  restore  the  surfaces  and  contours  to  an  acceptable  quality  and  maintainable \ncondition.  Such  pavements  require  surface  reconstruction  and  strengthening  to  handle  future \ntraffic. Some new surface sealing might be required in areas of high erosion potential, such as \nsteep  slopes.  Rehabilitation  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  investigation  and  design  criteria, \nthough  a  range  of  engineering  solutions  will  be  considered.  Rehabilitation  works  also  might \ninclude minor upgrading and safety improvements. \n\nSubproject Eligibility Criteria  \n\nB. \n\n3. \n\nSubprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n\n(i) \n\nThe subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads assessed as high development \npriorities  based  on  their  contribution  to  the  objectives  of  the  National  Economic \nRecovery, Reform, and Development Plan, particularly: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nimproved  accessibility \nhouseholds, \nextension services; \n\nincluding  schools,  health \n\nto  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nfacilities,  and  Government \n\nincreased  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  among \npoor and rural households; \n\npotential  for  increased  private  sector  participation  in  provincial  and \nnational economic activities; \n\npotential to catalyze development in remote areas with poor access; and  \n\ncontribution to poverty reduction among poor and rural households. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  endorse  the  subprojects  through  their  inclusion  and \nprioritization in the NTP. \n\n4. \nSubprojects will be economically viable, and will demonstrate an economic internal rate \nof  return  of  at  least  12%.  An  economic  analysis  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) guidelines for the economic analysis of projects.1 In addition to the \nstandard  parameters  of  road  sector  analysis,2  the  subproject  will  be  assessed  on  quantitative \ngrounds for its contribution to \n\n(i) \n\npotential  for  increased  agriculture  due  to  lower  freight  costs  and  more  reliable \naccess; \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997.

No  subproject  classified \n5. \nas Category A in accordance with ADB's environmental assessment guidelines,3 will be eligible \nfor  funding  under  the  Project.  In  selecting  subproject  sites,  including  extraction  sites  for \nmaterials to be imported to the road construction sites, the following environmental criteria will \nbe used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to the site, \nthen the subproject will not be accepted as part of the Project: \n\n(i)   \n\nroads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \nCategory  A,  requiring  the  production  of  an  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA) \n\n(ii) \n\nrequirement for major re-alignment of the existing road; \n\n(ii)   \n\nsignificant loss of natural/primary forest; \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsignificant  loss  or  damage  to  near-shore  marine  environments,  such  as  reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n\npermanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n\npermanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n6. \nScreening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects. No subproject that would entail involuntary resettlement, according to ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement,4 will be eligible for funding under the Project.5\n \nC. \n\nSubproject Assessment Process \n\n7. \nPotential  subprojects  are  identified  and  prioritized  in  the  NTP  based  on  high-level \nassessments of (i) existing networks; (ii) technical feasibility of providing access by alternative \nmodes;  (iii)  positive  and  negative  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts;  and  (v)  the \nneed for connecting infrastructure (Appendix 2).  \n\n8. \nThe Executing Agency, assisted by the Project Management and Capacity Building Unit \n(PMCBU), will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject based on the criteria \ndescribed in Section B. Each assessment will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to \ndetermine  the  detailed  feasibility  and  impacts  expected,  using  generally  accepted  transport \nplanning methods. Community consultations will be conducted to (i) validate baseline data; (ii) \nidentify  positive  and  negative  impacts;  and  (iii)  evaluate  technical,  social,  and  environmental \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2003.

The objective is to enhance capability to a \nlevel that will enable standards of design and implementation management to be sustained at a \nsatisfactory \ninstitutional \nlevel  with  minimal  assistance  after  project  completion.  Some \nstrengthening  activities  have  been  completed  or  are  underway,  including  TA  4494-SOL: \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (ISMID).3 Activities \nunder  this  component  will  refine,  expand,  and  build  upon  ISMID  achievements.  As  such, \ncoordination with the ISMID TA, which will be ongoing at project inception, is essential. \n\nThe  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  MID  will  be  accomplished \n5. \nthrough  on-the-job  training,  workshops  and  seminars  conducted  by  the  consultants,  external \ntraining  (as  appropriate),  and  development  and  implementation  of  standard  procedures  and \ncodes  of  practice  appropriate  for  MID  operations  and  responsibilities.  The  PMCBU  will \nundertake the following capacity building activities: \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nin  developing  systems  and  procedures \n\nCoordinate with the project team that is implementing the ISMID TA. \nAssist MID in Honiara and the provinces in enhancing its capacity in all aspects \nof road and bridge infrastructure planning and management. \nFurther  develop  training  in  asset  management,  including  baseline  asset \ninventory. \nAssist  MID \nassessment, monitoring, and reporting. \nAdvise  and  assist  in  implementing  systems  and  procedures  for  procurement  of \nservices and equipment, including under international competitive bidding. \nFurther  develop  improved  business  processes  in  MID\u2019s  support  functions,  with \nrespect  to  financial  management,  planning  and  programming,  procurement, \nquality assurance, and monitoring. \nAssist  MID  in  the  development  and  trial  of  a  labor-based  equipment  supported \n(LBES) maintenance program. \n\nfor  environmental \n\n(viii)  Refine  MID\u2019s  maintenance  program  and  develop  procedures \n\nfor  using \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts,  participatory  processes  (including \nLBES  contracts  and  other  community-based  initiatives),  and  private  sector \nparticipation. \nRefine  tools  based  on  ISMID  trial  testing,  including  manuals,  guidelines  and \nprocedures,  use  of  off-the-shelf  software  (potentially  including  databases), \n\n(ix) \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.

Yes \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector and/or subsector to poverty reduction in Solomon Islands:  \n\nDue  to  several  years  of conflict  (1999\u20132003),  real  gross domestic  product (GDP)  per capita  declined  by \n35%  to  about  $500.  Since  2003,  GDP  growth  has  averaged  4\u20135%.  Based  on  projected  economic  and \npopulation  growth  rates,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands \nestimate  that  the  economy  will  require  another  20  years  to  return  to  the  pre-conflict  level  of  GDP  per \ncapita.  The distribution  of national  income  is  highly  uneven between Honiara and  provincial  centers  and \nrural  villages;  between  rich  and  poor;  and  between  women  and  men.  Solomon  Islands,  one  of  the  least \ndeveloped  among  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  ranks \nsecond  lowest  among  Pacific  island  countries  in  the  United  Nations\u2019  Human  Development  Index.  The \ncountry is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n\nThe  socioeconomic  situation  is  characterized  by  high  unemployment,  especially  among  the  youth,  and \nrapid  population  growth.  The  annual  population  growth  rate  of  2.9%  is  among  the  highest  in  the  world. \nCombined  with  slow  economic  growth,  this  situation  exacerbates  poverty.  The  economy  is  based  on \nprimary commodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Jobs are in short supply everywhere, with little \nformal  employment  outside  the  capital  of  Honiara,  and  scarce  income-generating  opportunities  in  rural \nareas.  Falling  commodity  prices,  deteriorating  rural  infrastructure,  lack  of  rural  services  and  access  to \nmarkets, and low-productivity traditional cultivation practices hamper rural agricultural development. Poor \nand  expensive  infrastructure  facilities,  lack  of  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  poor \nbusiness  and  banking  services,  and  a  limited  market  constrain  the  development  of  the  private  sector. \nSolomon Islands has some of the worst education and health statistics in the Pacific, which are a legacy of \nweak public institutions, low public funding, and poor service delivery in these sectors. Poor transportation \ninfrastructure, including roads, also hampers access to education and health facilities and services.   \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  focus  on  the  rehabilitation  of  provincial  and  secondary  roads  matches  the  Government \npriorities, as set out in the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan (NERRDP). The \nentire road network\u2014from feeder roads to national roads\u2014is quickly deteriorating and impassable at many \npoints. The network requires urgent improvements to maintain access of the rural population to markets \nand services. Two key objectives are (i) to ensure connections between rural production and markets; and \n(ii) to improve access to health, education, and other services. While contributing to the overarching goal \nof poverty reduction, the rehabilitation of rural roads should be complemented by a long-term strategy to \nensure  connectivity  between  national,  provincial,  secondary,  and  rural  feeder  roads;  and  cost-effective \nmethods to ensure sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads. \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                 Proposed Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nPoverty analysis of the subproject will be combined with social analyses, given the overlap between these \nanalyses.  \n\nThe poverty and social analysis (PSA) will focus on the population in the corridors of influence (COI) in the \npotential  subproject  areas,  as  well  as  others  who  might  be  impacted  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  project \n(known as COI plus). The PSA will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will involve gathering and \nanalyzing  secondary  data  on  the  population  living  within  the  COIs,  including  information  on  poverty, \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nhuman  development,  livelihoods,  and  accessibility  of  social  services.  Sources  of  preliminary  secondary \ndata include the 1997 census, United Nations Development Program Provincial Development Profiles, the \n2002 Solomon Islands Human Development Report, and the forthcoming national Household Income and \nExpenditure Survey. More in-depth secondary data possibly may be obtained from pertinent ministries in \nHoniara.  \n\nSome  subprojects  could  be  screened  out  based  on  an  analysis  of  secondary  data.  For  example,  a \npotential  subproject  could  be  removed  from  further  consideration  due  to  the  small  size  of  the  COI  plus \npopulation in relation to preliminary costing of road rehabilitation, relatively low poverty incidence, and/or \nthe lack of connectivity of the road to markets or social services.  \n\nThe  second  stage  of  the  PSA  will  involve  direct  engagement  with  appropriate  stakeholders  within  the \nprovinces of the potential subprojects, and field-level impact assessment with representative communities \nalong  the  COI.  The  impact  assessment will  involve  a  combination  of  key  informant  interviews and  focus \ngroup discussions with a range of stakeholders and social groups (these groups will be identified as part of \nthe process), including poor and non-poor, males and females, young and old, the disabled, and transport \nproviders.  \n\nThe purpose of the PSA of the Project is to (i) assess project impacts and risks, (ii) mitigate and manage \nthe  adverse  impacts,  and  (iii)  assess  the  interest  and  capacity  of  stakeholder  and  social  groups  to \ncontribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \n\nThe  potential  poverty  and  social  impacts  of  road  rehabilitation  stem  from  the  improvement  of  people\u2019s \naccess to (i) local markets and provincial markets; (ii) basic and higher-level education and health facilities \nand  services;  (iii)  administrative  and  service  centers;  and  (iv)  agricultural  fields,  water  supplies,  and \nfirewood.  Road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  activities  also  directly  provide  jobs  for  local  groups  and \nindividuals. \n\nThe potential economic benefits of road rehabilitation can be measured in terms of: \n\ntime savings from switching to motorized road transport from walking or boats, \n\npassenger and freight cost savings, \n\nvehicle operating cost savings, \n\ngenerated traffic, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ninduced agricultural production and tourism, and \n\nwages paid to local labor for road rehabilitation and maintenance activities. \n\nThe  proportion  of  potential  economic  benefits  that  accrue  to  the  poor  and  non-poor  can  be  calculated \nthrough distributional analysis. However, determining whether the additional data collection and analysis \ninvolved  is  justified  will  depend  in  part  upon  the  findings  of  the  initial  qualitative  poverty  analysis.  A \nqualitative assessment of the degree to which the poor and non-poor are benefiting economically through \nthe channels outlined above might be sufficient.  \n\nOther benefits of the Project might include a more educated and healthy population. However, further data \nand  analysis  needs  aside,  these  are  merit  goods  in  their  own  right,  and  cannot  be  captured  fully  in  the \neconomic analysis. Measuring the increase in school attendance and use of health services resulting from \nroad rehabilitation will be sufficient. All impacts should be disaggregated by income and gender, as much \nas possible. \n\nAlthough this should not be assumed, the rehabilitation of a road might bring about simultaneously all the \nabove-mentioned benefits. The relative importance attached to different beneficial impacts should reflect \nthe  priorities  of  communities  in  the  COIs,  as  determined  through  the  poverty  and  social  impact,  and \npriorities established by Government planning processes.  \n\nPotential adverse impacts include the hazard to pedestrians, particularly from increased and faster traffic \nbrought about by road rehabilitation. A higher risk of HIV/AIDS is another potential adverse impact, since \nthe  road  transport  sector  is  a  vector  for  transmission.  Road  safety  and HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nwill be built into the Project to help mitigate these risks.  \n\nLand holds tambu (sacred) sites and monuments that represent the history of people\u2019s clans, lineage, and \nsociety.  Because  of  these  historical  ties,  land  becomes  an  important  link  between  the  living  and  their \nancestors.  Politically,  land  binds  people  together  as  a  landowning  group.  It  is  a  source  of  political  and \neconomic power, and is fundamental to Solomon Islanders\u2019 identity. Land is under customary tenure, with \nhouseholds often enjoying individual usufruct.   \n\nThe centrality of land to people\u2019s identity implies that the Project needs to work closely and sensitively with \nresource  owners  to  avoid  misunderstandings  and  gain  their  cooperation.  Road  rehabilitation  work  will \nentail gaining access to, and the use of, aggregates on customary land. It also might involve minor road \nrealignments, or the reclaiming of the fringes of remnant roads over which de facto property rights have \ndeveloped. Therefore, the Project must establish a credible liaison scheme with communities in the COIs \nfor discussing these issues and gaining resource owners\u2019 oral and written consent. \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes \n\nA  national  transport  task  force  (TTF),  comprising  representatives  of  Government,  transport  users,  and \ntransport  service  providers,  is  being  established  to  advise  on  key  issues,  development  options,  and \nprioritization. These same stakeholders also will have opportunity to provide inputs and comments during \nthe  development  of  the  National  Transport  Plan,  which  is  being  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and \nDevelopment  (MID).  Under  ADB\u2019s  Institutional  Strengthening  of  MID  technical  assistance,  systems  are \nbeing  established  in  MID  for  undertaking  a  series  of  population  and/or  accessibility  field  surveys  along \nCOIs  beginning  in  2006.  These  surveys  will  provide  another  avenue  for  transport  users\u2019  to  incorporate \ntheir priorities and needs into the road sector planning framework. \n\nDuring  the  poverty  and  social  analysis,  stakeholders  will  be  identified  in  each  subproject  location.  The \nfocus  will  be  on  those  who  live  with,  or  service,  the  COIs.  Stakeholders  to  be  consulted  will  include \nresource  owners,  urban  and  rural  households  and  individuals,  poor  and  non-poor,  females  and  males, \nyoung and old, the disabled, community-based organizations, transport service providers and users, local \ncontractors,  and  provincial  and  sub-provincial  governments.  The  stakeholder  analysis  will  (i)  identify \nstakeholders;  (ii)  assess  their  interests  in  the  Project,  as  well  as  the  potential  impact  of  the  Project  on \nthese  interests;  (iii)  assess  the  power  of  the  stakeholders,  and  the  importance  of  the  stakeholders  to \nproject success; and (iv) outline a stakeholder participation strategy.   \n\nIs there a participation strategy? Yes \n\nA good relationship between the Project and community members and/or resource owners will be critical \nto  its  success.  For  each  subproject,  MID  and  the  Project  Management  and  Capacity  Building  Unit  will \nmaintain contact  with  communities  in  the  COI on  all project  matters,  including  issues  related  to  property \nrights,  access  to  and  use  of  aggregates,  and  the  recruitment  of  labor  from  communities  for  road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  possibility  of  labor  contracts  with  community  groups  (as  well  as \nindividuals), and with women, will be explored actively with communities. Some opportunities also will exist \nfor  interaction  and  consultation  with  local  communities  regarding  HIV/AIDS  and  road  safety  issues.  In \naddition,  where  the  labor-based  equipment  support  approach  is  intended  to  be  used  by  the  Project, \ncommunities will be involved actively in its design and implementation. Activities to build their capacities in \nroad rehabilitation and maintenance will be included.  \n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nAs the PSA will be gender-disaggregated, it will take into account the differential project impacts and risks \nfacing females, gender-specific measures to mitigate and/or manage these impacts, and the interests and \ncapacities of females to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. The Project will be proactive in \n\n \n\n\fensuring that women are involved in road rehabilitation and maintenance, HIV/AIDS prevention, and road \nsafety activities of the Project.  \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nHas an output been prepared?

The summary IEE summarizes the findings of \nthe  IEE  regarding  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project,  their  magnitude  and  duration,  and \npotentially affected groups.  \n\n2. \nAn  environmental  assessment  of  the  Project  has  been  undertaken  to  develop \nenvironmental screening criteria for subproject selection, and an environmental assessment and \nreview  procedure  for  subproject  assessment.  A  sample  subproject  on  the  island  of  Ghizo  in \nWestern  Province  has  been  carried  out  to  assist  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  the \nProject.  The  sample  subproject  and  the  Project  are  classified  as  Category  B  under  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  guidelines.1  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure \n(EARP), which is in Supplementary Appendix E, will ensure that only subprojects that fall within \nthis category are included in the Project. \n\n3. \nThe Project will comply with the environmental provisions of ADB and the Government of \nSolomon  Islands.  The  EARP  follows  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy2  and  guiding \nframework  (2003  and  later  revisions).  It  is  also  aligned  with  the  environmental  impact \nassessment process required under the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1988) and the National \nEnvironmental  Management  Strategy  (1993).  Mitigation  measures  are  prescribed  in  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  is  presented  in  detail  in  the  IEE  and  in  a \ngeneralized form as Table A10 to demonstrate the environmental management and monitoring \nrequirements of the Project. National law does not require formal approval of the summary IEE, \nIEE, EMP, or EARP. \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n4. \nThe proposed Project aims to rehabilitate provincial and secondary roads. The outcome \nwill  be  improved  road  infrastructure  for  economic  and  social  development.  Project  activities \ninclude (i) rehabilitation and improvement of about 100 kilometers (km) of roads; (ii) labor-based \nequipment supported (LBES) road maintenance; (iii) sound and sustainable road maintenance \npolicies  and  practices;  (iv)  an  efficient  bidding  and  contracting  system  for  engaging  private \nsector  contractors  and  communities  in  road  maintenance;  and  (v)  improved  project  appraisal, \nmanagement, supervision, and monitoring. \n\n5. \nThe subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads rated as high development priorities, \nbased  on  agreed  criteria.  No  subproject  categorized  as  Category  A,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  or  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (2005),  shall  be  included  as  a \nsubproject. \n\n6. \nRehabilitation  works  will  entail  upgrading  of  existing  unsealed  rural  roads.  No \nrealignment  or  new  road  construction  will  be  carried  out.  Construction  activities  will  involve  (i) \nvegetation removal immediately adjacent to the road, (ii) excavation and disposal of unsuitable \nmaterial  from  road  shoulders  and  cuttings,  (iii)  placement  and  compaction  of  granular  road \nbase, and (iv) reconstruction of bridges and culverts. Drains will be reconstructed along the road \nshoulders and diverted to suitable discharge points. They will be designed to minimize erosion \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n2 ADB. 2002. Environment Policy.

The  upgrade  works  will  require  locally  sourced  sub-base  and  base  materials \nfrom quarries and borrow pits suitably located to avoid adverse impacts. Some sections of road, \nsuch as along steep slopes and within towns, might be sealed with bitumen. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nPhysical  Resources.  Solomon  Islands  is  an  archipelago  with  a  land  area  of  about \n7. \n28,000 square kilometers in the southwest Pacific. The 992 islands extend 1,667 km southeast. \nSix major island groups make up 80% of the land area in two roughly parallel island chains. The \nnorthern  group  includes  Choiseul,  Isabel,  and  Malaita,  while  the  southern  group  has  New \nGeorgia,  Guadalcanal,  and  Makira.  The  country  is  divided  into  nine  provinces:  Central, \nChoiseul, Guadalcanal, Isabel, Makira, Malaita, Renbel, Temoutu, and Western. \n\n8. \nMany of the larger islands are rugged, heavily forested, and mountainous, while others \nare  low-lying  coral  atolls.  Topographically,  the  varied  and  rugged  terrain  supports  an \nextraordinary  biodiversity  and  wide  range  of  ecosystems.  Most  of  the  islands  are  of  volcanic \norigin,  surrounded  by  uplifted  coral  terraces  and  fringed  by  coral  reefs.  The  soils  found  in \nSolomon Islands generally are well-drained and deep, though upland soils tend to be clay-rich \nand  poorly  drained.  On  moderate  and  steep  slopes,  the  soils  are  eroded  easily  where \nvegetation has been removed.   \n\n9. \nSolomon  Islands  has  a  tropical  climate  with  a  relatively  high  and  uniform  temperature, \nhigh humidity, and abundant rainfall. The mean annual rainfall is 3\u20135 meters, though this varies \nconsiderably.  Heavy  rains  and  cyclones  generally  occur  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year. \nExtensive  rivers  and  perennial  streams  are  found  on  the  larger  islands  throughout  the \narchipelago. Rural communities obtain water primarily from streams, rivers, and springs, which \ncan be vulnerable to contamination. Many communities also harvest rainfall from building roofs \nfor drinking water. \n\n10.  Mitigation  measures  (such  as  terracing,  construction  of  efficient  drains,  and  planting  to \nstabilize  slopes)  will  provide  long-term  beneficial  effects  by  reducing  soil  erosion  and \nsedimentation  of  surface  waters.  Construction  of  well-designed  drainage  systems  capable  of \nhandling the high intensity runoff characteristic of the region also will reduce localized flooding. \nWell-engineered  slopes  and  drainage  systems,  combined  with  thorough  planting,  will  reduce \nsignificantly the likelihood of landslides near the project roads. \n\n11. \nEcological  Resources.  Solomon  Islands  has  a  large  number  of  terrestrial  and  marine \necosystems, many with exceptionally high biodiversity and endemism. About 80% of the country \nis covered with dense tropical rainforest. The rainforest is an important traditional resource for \nrural communities, providing food, building materials, and medicines. \n\n12. \nCommercial forestry plays a central role in the economy of Solomon Islands by creating \njobs and generating revenue. However, when undertaken unsustainably, logging damages the \nenvironment with long-term irretrievable loss of resources. Soil erosion, contamination of water \nsupplies,  loss  of  non-timber  resources,  and  damage  to  coral  reefs  due  to  sedimentation  are \nsome  of  the  major  impacts.  The  rate  of  extraction  of  logs  has  risen  sharply  over  the  past  5 \nyears. At current rates, natural forest resources are projected to be depleted before 2020.  \n\nFisheries  and  other  marine  resources  are  an  important  component  of  the  natural \n13. \nenvironment that the rural population heavily depends on. Up to 90% of the country\u2019s population \nrelies  on  fish  and  shellfish  as  a  food  source  harvested  largely  from  near-shore  coral  reefs, \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\nlagoons, mangrove swamps, and sea grass beds. The Solomon Islands coral reefs are mainly \nfringing  and  intermittent  around  all  of  the  islands.  The  status  of  coral  reefs  in  the  Solomon \nIslands is relatively unknown, although the large increase in sediment runoff from logged areas \nprobably has impacted coral reefs and coastal fisheries severely in many places. \n\n14.  While  large,  formally  established  protected  areas  are  few,  many  smaller  sites  are \ninformally  protected  with  the  assistance  from  nongovernment  organizations,  resource  owners, \nand community groups that that are being successfully managed. These include Kolombangara \n(Western  Province),  the  Bauro  Highlands  (Makira  Province),  and  the  East  Rennell  World \nHeritage site (Renbel Province).  \n\n15. \nSocial and Cultural Resources. The vast majority of the population of about 475,000 is \nMelanesian (95%), with the remainder being mostly of Polynesian origin. The population density \non some 347 islands is about 15 people per km2, one of the lowest in the Pacific. More than half \nof the population is below 15 years old. Malaita and Guadalcanal account for approximately half \nof  the  population.  The  next  largest  populated  area  is  Western  Province  (65,000),  with  roughly \nequal  numbers  of  people  living  in  Choiseul,  Isabel,  Makira,  Central,  and  Temotu  provinces. \nRenbel Province is the most sparsely populated. With an estimated annual growth rate of 2.9% \nover the past 5 years, the population is expected to nearly double by 2050.  \n\n16. \nA prominent feature of the Solomon Islands is the widely dispersed rural population and \nthe many small villages, which are home to nearly 75% of the population. The country has an \nestimated 4,200 settlements with an average of 70 people in each and 6 people per household. \nThe relatively small population of internally diverse ethnic and linguistic groups dispersed over a \nlarge,  fragmented  land  area  of  mostly  rugged  terrain  with  a  limited  transportation  and \ncommunications infrastructure create conditions that hamper the delivery of basic services and \nrestrict  economic  growth.  As  a  result,  social  and  health  indicators  are  among  the  worst  in  the \nPacific. \n\n17. \nThe Solomon Islands has been termed a \u201cdual economy,\u201d  because the rural areas are \nlargely  subsistence-based,  while  the  few  main  population  centers  (e.g.,  Honiara)  are  cash-\nbased. The majority of the country\u2019s population depends almost solely on subsistence activities, \nsuch  as  vegetable  gardening,  hunting  and/or  gathering,  and  fishing.  Gradually,  subsistence \ngroups are becoming more dependent on earning cash\u2014largely from leasing customary lands \nto  logging  companies,  or  exchanging  goods  or  services\u2014which  can  be  used  to  purchase \nmanufactured goods and other items not obtainable from the immediate natural environment. \n\n18. \nAn  official  listing  of  sites  of  cultural,  historical,  or  archaeological  importance  is  not \navailable.  Within  the  subproject  areas,  the  EARP  will  identify  any  sites  of  clear  cultural \nsignificance, which will not be disturbed by the road rehabilitation. \n\nD. \n\nForecast of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  have  been  forecast  using  available  national \n19. \ninformation  and  data  from  the  sample  subproject  IEE.  Screening  of  probable  subprojects  has \ndetermined  that  they  are  not  likely  to  be  located  in  or  near  protected  areas,  or  in  ecologically \nsensitive  areas,  and  that  environmental  impacts  will  be  minor.  However,  site-specific \nenvironmental  screening  of  each  subproject  through  the  IEE  process  will  confirm  the \nenvironmental  effects  and  the  impact  categorization.  The  EARP  (Supplementary  Appendix  E) \nwill preclude subprojects in or adjacent to sensitive habitats and ecosystems, or those that will \nproduce significant environmental impacts.  \n\nPotential  adverse  environmental  effects  during  the  construction  of  subprojects,  with \n\n20. \ngeneric mitigation and monitoring measures, are described in the remainder of this section. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSoil  Erosion  and  Sedimentation.  The  intense,  high-frequency  rainfall  patterns  in  the \n21. \nSolomon Islands has the potential to affect temporarily downstream surface water catchments \nand  sensitive  near-shore  marine  environments \nthrough  soil  erosion  and  associated \nsedimentation during road construction. Sediment contamination can harm downstream drinking \nwater supplies and freshwater ecosystems. Inland and coastal construction also can affect the \nnear-shore marine environment and sensitive reefs by generating a coastal sediment plume at \nriver mouths.  \n\n22. \nThe  main  sources  of  potential  sediment  discharge  are  excavation  works  on  slopes \nabove and adjacent to rivers, and at the coastline. Subprojects in topographically steep terrain, \non the coast, or adjacent to waterways might risk erosion and slope instability during and after \nconstruction. \n\nSimple  and  effective  mitigation  measures  employing  engineering  best  practices  can \n23. \nensure that adverse effects associated with erosion and sedimentation are avoided. These risks \ncan  be  mitigated  through  (i)  rapid  replanting  of  vegetation,  (ii)  intercepting  ditches  above  and \nbelow slopes, (iii) terracing or stepping slopes, (iv) flow dissipating structures in drains, and (v) \nrock lining drains where necessary. On coastal sections of road, the installation of sea walls or \nother  protective  measures  can  reduce  erosion.  Successful  avoidance  or  mitigation  of  soil \nerosion and sediment issues depends on careful planning before works start, as well as a daily \ninspection and maintenance schedule for mitigation works.   \n\n24. \nThe  contractor  should  locate  and  be  aware  of  drinking  water  sources  downstream  of \nroad  construction  activities.  Stringent  mitigation  measures  should  be  in  place  to  prevent \ncontamination  of  these  sources  from  sediment  or  any  hazardous  substances.  The  EMP \nspecifies that this activity should be undertaken before works begin. \n\n25. \nAggregate  Extraction.  Construction  materials,  such  as  sand,  gravel,  and  borrow,  will \nneed to be extracted from the surrounding areas. Aggregate extraction from quarries or borrow \npits  potentially  can  cause  adverse  environmental  and  social  effects.  These  extraction  areas \nmust be selected carefully to avoid impacting sites with ecological or conservation significance.  \n\n26. \nThe  Project  Management  and  Capacity  Building  Unit  (PMCBU)  will  develop  aggregate \nextraction guidelines for the Project, which will encompass (i) negotiation and consultation with \nlandowners; (ii) the environmental effects of extraction (sedimentation, ecological disturbances, \nslope stability); (iii) site safety and public protection; and (iv) remediation of the extraction sites. \nSustainable  extraction  plans,  which  will  have  to  be  prepared  during  the  IEE  process,  must \nadhere to a code of practice developed by MID for gravel abstraction. Aggregate sources will be \nagreed  upon  in  close  consultation  with  the  local  community.  Aggregates  may  not  be  sourced \nfrom river beds, beaches, or reefs.  \n\n27. \nFreshwater  and  Coastal  Water  Quality.  Localized  contamination  of  the  aquatic \nenvironment  by  hazardous  chemicals,  including  fuels,  bitumen,  and  lubricants  used  on \nconstruction sites and at encampments, has been identified as another potential risk. Fuel, oil, \nbitumen chemical storage facilities, as well as bitumen plants, will be positioned away from any \nwater body or drainage course. Further, they will on the inland side of coastal roads, and will not \nbe  on  beaches  or  immediately  adjacent  to  the  high  water  mark.  Bulk  storage  facilities  for  fuel \nand bitumen will be surrounded by appropriate containment methods and a spill response plan \nwill be approved before works begin. Waste materials from construction sites and construction \ncamps  will  be  removed  and  disposed  of  in  areas  that  pose  minimal  risk  of  contaminating \nfreshwater  and  coastal  environments.  Further,  these  materials  will  be  disposed  of  in  manner \nthat poses no safety risk to the local rural population. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nHot  mix  bitumen  plants,  as  well  as  the  areas  for  loading,  unloading,  and  discharging \n28. \naggregate materials, will be at least 30 meters from any waterway, drainage course, beach, or \nwetland.  The  plant  will  be  surrounded  by  appropriate  containment  methods  with  oil  traps \nconstructed to prevent the runoff of any contaminant into streams, wetlands, or the coast. Waste \nbitumen will be disposed of at a location approved by the PMCBU, and should be in an area at \nleast 500 meters from the coast or any waterway. \n\n29. \nBefore  works  begin,  drinking  water  sources  will  be  identified  along  the  road  route \nthrough  the  detailed  IEE.  Special  care  will  be  taken  when  working  upstream  of  drinking  water \nsupplies. Precautionary measures to warn local residents of potential contamination risks and to \nensure alternative sources are available, when necessary. \n\n30. \nPrivate  and  Agricultural  Lands.  As  the  subprojects  are  upgrades  of  roads  on  the \nexisting  alignments,  permanent  impacts  on  soil,  vegetation,  and  land  use  are  not  foreseen. \nDuring construction, however, minor impacts on adjacent cultivated lands, plantations, roadside \ncrops, gardens, and residential properties might occur. In some areas, the often overgrown road \ncorridor  will have  to  be cleared  to  accommodate  shoulders  and  drains;  and,  in  some  cases, it \nwill be raised. Where the clearance of the road margin encroaches on land, landowners will be \nconsulted.  In  most  cases,  the  road  corridor  will  be  widened  only  to  its  original  width.  No \nhabitations  are  expected  to  lie  on  the  existing  right-of-way,  and  no  involuntary  relocation  of \nresidents will be allowed under the Project. When the road is raised, effective drainage controls \nwill be incorporated into the design to prevent excessive runoff or flooding onto the surrounding \nland and in the vicinity of dwellings. \n\n31. \nNegative  impacts  from  drainage  and  sedimentation  on  roadside  agricultural  lands  and \nresidential  properties  will  be  avoided  by  (i)  locating  spoil  disposal  and  construction  material \nstorage  areas  where  they  will  not  affect  valuable  land;  (ii)  controlling  sediment  discharge;  (iii) \nutilizing cutoff drains and other sediment control measures, such as silt fences and grit traps; (v) \nusing  effective  storm  water  control  measures;  and  (vi)  careful  design  and  location  of  culverts \nbased on local drainage regimes to prevent flooding and sedimentation. \n\n32. \nAir  Quality  and  Noise  Effects.  Construction  might  affect  air  quality  due  to  the \ngeneration of  dust,  emissions  from  vehicles,  and  local  emission  of  toxic  gases  and  particulate \nmatter from bitumen plants (where sealing is to occur). These effects, however, are expected to \nbe  short-lived,  localized,  and  minor.  Mitigation  measures  to  reduce  impacts  on  air  quality  and \npublic health will include (i) spraying water to suppress dust during construction, (ii) limiting the \nroad area that will be worked on at one time, and (iii) locating asphalt and crushing plants at a \nsufficient distance from dwellings or community facilities. \n\n33. \nHigher noise levels are expected during construction. However, the impact will be limited \nto  within  about  100  meters  of  the  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  moderate.  Mitigation \nrequirements to minimize noise impacts include (i) placing stationary equipment at sites along \nuninhabited stretches; (ii) prohibiting construction during sensitive hours near residential areas \nand near schools during attendance hours; and (iii) keeping construction equipment in a good \nstate of repair. \n\n34. \nRoad  Safety.  Local  communities  will  use  the  subproject  roads  during  construction, \nwhich  can  pose  a  safety  risk.  This  risk  will  be  avoided  by  ensuring  specific  measures  are \nundertaken,  including  timing  the  works  to  avoid  periods  when  children  are  on  the  road,  using \nclear signage, ensuring site safety staff are on duty at critical times, and providing road safety \neducation at the schools.  \n\n35. \nCommercial  Forestry.  Improved  access  to  rural  areas  might  induce  damaging \nenvironmental  activities,  such  as  commercial  logging.  Logging  operators  could  benefit  from \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nrehabilitated roads in many indirect ways. However, a rehabilitated road is unlikely to contribute \nto  opening  up  new  forest  areas  for  logging,  because  all  project  roads  are  pre-existing  access \nroutes. Moreover, most logging operations construct their own roads and beach landings rather \nthan  trucking  logs  along  provincial  roads.  Heavy  logging  equipment  might  use  the  coastal \nsections  of  the  rehabilitated  roads,  which  could  cause  significant  damage,  particularly  during \nwet  weather.  Provincial  government  authorities  should  agree  on  the  use  of  the  rehabilitated \nroads by logging companies. Further, new bridge structures should be designed carefully with \nweight and width limits to inhibit their use by heavy and potentially damaging logging vehicles \nand equipment. \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n36. \nInitial  screening  of  potential  subprojects  has  determined  that  they  are  unlikely  to  be \nlocated  in  or  near  protected  areas,  or  in  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  Further  screening  in  the \nIEE  will  establish  whether  proposed  rehabilitation  works  might  affect  environmentally  sensitive \nsites,  and  entail  the  loss  of  flora  or  fauna  with  conservation  significance.  Criteria  for  the \nselection  of  subprojects  will  preclude  those  in,  or  adjacent  to,  sensitive  habitats  and \necosystems. \n\n37. \nIn selecting subproject sites, including extraction sites for materials to be imported to the \nroad  construction  sites,  environmental  criteria  have  been  established  for  the  first  level  of \nscreening. If any of the following criteria are found applicable to the site, the subproject will not \nbe accepted as part of the Project: \n\n(i)   \n\nroads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \nCategory  A,  requiring  the  production  of  an  environmentalimpact  assessment \n(EIA) \n\n(ii) \n\nrequirement for major re-alignment of the existing road; \n\n(ii)   \n\nsignificant loss of natural/primary forest; \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nsignificant  loss  or  damage  to  near-shore  marine  environments,  such  as  reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n\npermanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \n\npermanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n38. \nThe IEE process to be applied will confirm these criteria, or recommend further work to \ncomplete  the  assessment.  The  preparation  of  the  IEE  document  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the EARP. All subprojects will require an IEE. \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Requirements\u2014Environmental Management and Monitoring \n\nThe  PMCBU  will  administer  and  coordinate  daily  activities  and  overall  project \n39. \nimplementation. The PMCBU will assign a qualified staff member for environmental compliance \nto  prepare  subproject  IEEs,  outline  EMPs,  and  provide  training  within  the  PMCBU  team.  The \nproject  manager  will  ensure  that  requirements  of  the  EMP  are  included  in  the  contract \ndocumentation, while the PMCBU will oversee and monitor the implementation of the EMP and \nEARP. \n\n40. \nThe Environment and Conservation Division (ECD) of the Ministry for the Environment of \nthe  Department  of  Forests,  Environment  and  Conservation  (DFEC)  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring  the  environmental  management  and  mitigation  requirements  of  the  Project  are \nundertaken to good standard. The ECD also will audit EMPs. TA provided through the PMCBU \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nwill be available for participation by ECD to enable it to fulfill these functions, and to ensure that \nthe requirements of the Government\u2019s Environmental Act are implemented effectively. \n\n41. \nThe civil works contractor will be required to prepare and implement a detailed EMP at \nthe  construction  stage.  The  PMCBU  will  approve  the  plans  before  implementation.  The \ncontractor will undertake environmental monitoring under the supervision of the PMCBU.   \n\n42. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Plan.  The  EMP  consists  of  mitigation,  monitoring,  and \ninstitutional  measures  to  be  taken  during  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the \nsubprojects  to  eliminate  or  reduce  to  acceptable  levels  any  adverse  environmental  impact.  A \nsummary of the EMP is in Table A10. \n\n43. \nSubproject  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedure.  Supplementary \nAppendix  E  contains  the  EARP.  It  was  prepared  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy, and is consistent with the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1988) and the \nNational Environmental Management Strategy (1993).   \n\n44. \nReporting. A reporting system is a prerequisite for effective implementation of the EMP. \nDuring construction the PMCBU will provide quarterly reports to ADB on the implementation of \nthe EMP. The PMCBU is required to include a compliance status report, detailing environmental \nmitigation measures and monitoring. A designated PMCBU site engineer, who will be trained by \nthe  PMCBU  environmental  specialist,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  and \nreporting of the EMP. \n\n45. \nTraining.  To  ensure  the  success  of  the  proposed  institutional  and  environmental \nmanagement  arrangements,  training  and  skills  transfer  are  needed.  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough  the  training  of  local  staff  by  the  PMCBU  environmental  specialist  in  the  supervision, \nreview, and reporting of EMP activities during the initial phase of the Project.   \n\nG. \n\nCost Estimates for Assessment, Monitoring, and Training \n\nThe  PMCBU  estimates  include  36  person-months  for  environmental  specialists  (12 \n46. \nperson-months  international;  24  person-months  domestic).  In  addition,  the  estimates  include \nprovisional  sums  for  up  to  13  person-months  of  technical  services,  if  required.  The \nenvironmental specialists are expected to be employed full time during the assessment phase \nand intermittently during the monitoring phase.  \n\n47. \nThe  PMCBU  on  average  will  spend  40%  of  its  time  on  training.  The  international \nenvironmental specialists are expected to devote approximately 50% of their time to training the \ndomestic specialist and staff of the Environment and Conservation Department (ECD), who will \nhave oversight responsibilities. \n\nH. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nConsultations will be held during project implementation with representative community \n\n48. \nleaders and community members along the subproject road sections.   \n\n49. \nDuring  consultations  for  the  Ghizo  sample  subproject,  local  residents  raised  concerns \nover road safety and the loss of coconut trees if the road corridor needed to be widened. Some \nexpressed an interest in having road designs incorporate speed bumps for all areas with houses \nand  schools  near  the  road.  These  concerns  will  be  addressed  through  the  project  design,  as \nwell  as  through  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan.  In  general,  local \ncommunities displayed positive attitudes and a strong desire to see the roads improved. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nI. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n\n50. \nThe activities outlined for the Project are rehabilitation in scope, and no new construction \nis  planned.  The  findings  of  the  sample  subproject  IEE  confirm  that  this  Project  should  be \ndesignated  as  ADB  environmental  category  B.  No  component  activities  of  the  sector  project \nrequire a full EIA.  \n\n51. \nProject  activities  are  expected  to  have  only  minor  and  temporary  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  during  construction.  These  are  considered  tolerable  with  adherence  to  the \nsubproject environmental selection criteria and the defined mitigating measures, and as detailed \nin  the  subproject-specific  EMP.  With  proper  road  maintenance,  no  significant  adverse  impacts \nwill result from the existence and operation of the roads themselves. Maintenance activities will \nproduce minor impacts, though these are manageable through a continuation of the engineering \npractices and mitigation measures specified by the EMP. \n\n52. \nIn terms of capacity building in the Government environment sector, the Project should \nprovide local training of PMCBU and MID staff to undertake supervision, review, and reporting \nof EMP activities. The Project also should provide opportunities to the ECD of the Ministry for \nthe  Environment  to  participate  in  PMCBU  training  and  capacity  building  activities.  This  would \nenable  ECD  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  of  the  Government\u2019s  Environment  Act  are \nimplemented.  \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental Issues and \nPotential Impacts \n\nPre-Construction Phase \n\nTable A10: OUTLINE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN \n\n \n\nMitigation Measures Required \n\nImplementing \nOrganization  \n\nMonitoring Activity \n\nResponsible \nOrganization \n\n\u2022  Soil erosion and sediment \n\ncontamination of water resources \n(freshwater and coastal waters). \n\ni.

Performance  indicators  to  be  monitored  before,  during,  and  after \ntransport  sector \nconstruction  should \nperformance,  (iii)  socioeconomic  development,  (iv)  environmental  impacts,  (v)  maintenance, \nand  (vi)  institutional  development.  Based  on  these  guidelines  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and \nthe Project Management Capacity Building Unit (PMCBU) will develop quantitative indicators for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  purposes  before \nproject commencement, and will refine these indicators during project implementation. \n\nfor  (i)  economic  development,  (ii) \n\nthose \n\nfrom \n\n2. \nBaseline data for these indicators, which will be collected during the subproject feasibility \nanalysis,  will  be  monitored  after  subproject  completion.  Some  baseline  data  might  become \nincome  and  expenditure,  and  of \navailable \ndemographics  and  health\u2014to  be  conducted  in  2006\u20132007.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nbased  on  gender-disaggregated  data  where  feasible.  The  PMCBU  will  monitor  and  evaluate \nprogress on these indicators annually, and provide a final report within 6 months of the end of \nthe contract. \n\ntwo  national  surveys\u2014of  household \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Development \n\n Improved accessibility is expected to increase output volume and prices of agricultural \n3. \ncommodities  in  the  subproject  areas.  Baseline  data  on  the  production  and  prices  of  copra, \ncocoa, and market produce should be collected and updated. \n\nBaseline  data  on  formal  and  informal  employment,  disaggregated  by  sector  or  activity, \n4. \nshould  be  collected  and  updated.  During  and  after  rehabilitation,  data  should  be  kept  on  the \namount of employment created in rehabilitation and regular maintenance. \n\n5. \nIndicators  for  annual  household  income  and  sources  of  income  should  be  developed, \nbaseline  data  collected,  and  updated  annually.  The  percentage  of  poverty  or  hardship  of  the \npopulation or households in the project area also should be estimated. \n\nB. \n\nTransport Sector Performance \n\n6. \nSubproject  feasibility  studies  will  document  the  conditions  of  roads,  and  measure  and \nforecast  a  range  of  technical  performance  indicators  (Table  A11.1).  Appropriate  indicators \nshould be developed for rural conditions, which can be used during feasibility surveys, updated \nafter  rehabilitation,  and  monitored  before  and  after  annual  maintenance.  In  addition,  because \ntransport demand is linked to gross domestic product (GDP), the real annual GDP growth rates \nfor the country (and for the provinces, where available) should be reported with the results.   \n\n \n\nItem \n\nCondition \n\nPerformance \n\nTable A11.1: Transport Sector Performance Indicators \n\nIndicators \n\nRemarks \n\n\u2022  Roughness \n\u2022  Accessibility \n\u2022  Traffic volumes \n\u2022  Traffic growth \n\u2022  Travel times to key destinations \n\u2022  Vehicle ownership \n\u2022  Frequency of public transport services \n\n\u2022  Poor/fair/good \n\u2022  All weather/seasonal \n\u2022  AADT \n\u2022  % per year \n\u2022  Average  \n\u2022  By vehicle type \n\u2022  Number per day \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n61   \n\nItem \n\nIndicators \n\nRemarks \n\n\u2022  Cost of passenger transport services \n\u2022  Cost of freight transport services \n\u2022  Accident rates \n\n\u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  SBD per kilometer \n\u2022  Number per year \n\nAADT = average annual daily traffic, SBD \u2013 Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nC. \n\nSocioeconomic Development \n\nIndicators  should  be  developed  on  access  to  social  services,  including  school \n\n7. \nenrollment, visits to health facilities, and visits to government centers. \n\n8. \nIn  addition  to  the  economic  development  indicators  specified  above,  information  on \ngender-specific  impacts  of  the  Project  should  be  developed,  including  increased  employment \nand income for women and youth.  \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n9. \nThe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Project,  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  sample  subproject  at  Ghizo,  include  environmental \nmanagement  plans  that  identify  specific  environmental  impacts  that  must  be  monitored  during \nand after rehabilitation.  \n\nE. \n\nRoad Maintenance Inputs \n\n10. \nAll road maintenance work, including routine and periodic work carried out by traditional \nand labor-based equipment supported methods, should be recorded, including (i) nature of the \nwork; (ii) physical quantities of work performed; (iii) cost of the work; (iv) form of execution (by \ndirect labor, small contract, or large contractor); and (v) location and extent of the work.   \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n11. \nTwo  important  institutional  development  outputs  of  the  Project  are  (i)  enhanced \nmaintenance  arrangements,  with  improved  participation  of  communities  and  women  in  road \nmaintenance;  and  (ii)  improved  capabilities  in  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Development \n(MID) for project appraisal, management, supervision and monitoring.
