Unhampered \nextraction of carbon-based fossil resources such as coal and oil to meet the region\u2019s expanding \nenergy needs has added to the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to global \nclimate  change  and  harm  the  environment.  This  development  path  will  need  to  be  balanced \nover the long term with more sustainable alternatives.  \n \n3. \nDespite  rapid  development,  many  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  do  not  have  affordable  power  for  large  portions  of  their  populations \nbecause energy investment cannot keep up with demand. Some DMCs in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS)1 and in South Asia,2 whose energy sectors are less developed than those of \ntheir peers, obviously need attention. Because of policy, financial, and technical limitations, they \nhave  not  achieved  their  vast  potential  for  clean  energy  resource  development  and  clean \ntechnology  use.  Investing  in  a  clean  energy  sector  fund  that  would  provide  more  capital  to \nalternative  energy  and  environment  sector  projects  in  the  region  would  help  overcome  the \nfinancial limitations.  \n \nInvestment  in  clean  energy  projects  in  these  target  DMCs  is  low  primarily  because \n4. \n(i) energy policy frameworks do not adequately support or encourage clean energy projects, and \n(ii) the countries have limited financial and technical expertise in this sector. On the policy side, \nADB\u2019s  public  sector  departments  have  been  proactively  addressing  and  working  with  the \ncountry  governments  in  the  GMS  and  South  Asia  through  regional  cooperation  strategies  and \nprograms.  But,  especially  given  the  DMC  governments\u2019  limited  resources,  the  private  sector \nmust  also  mobilize  funds  for  energy  as  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms  are  made.  To \nachieve  energy  security  the  public  and  private  sectors  should  thus  complement  each  other  in \ninvesting in clean energy in the target DMCs. The private sector can efficiently mobilize funds \nfor the sector through various means, including long-term private equity. \n\n1. \n\nGreater Mekong Subregion \n\nThe  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program 3   for  energy  foresees  a \n5. \ncompetitive regional market that facilitates the optimal development and use of the subregion\u2019s \nenergy  resources,  contributing  significantly  to  economic  development  and  reducing  poverty.  4 \nThe development of regional power trade will enable the GMS countries to lower power costs, \nstabilize  supply,  and  reduce  GHG  emissions.  The  GMS  program  also  looks  forward  to  wider \ncooperation in the energy subsectors, including  alternative energy sources such as renewable \n\n                                                \n \n1  Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014collectively referred to in this \n\nreport as \u201cthe target countries in the GMS.\u201d \n\n2  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka\u2014referred to here as as \u201cthe target countries in South Asia.\u201d \n3  ADB.  2004. GMS Economic Cooperation Strategy and Program, 2004\u20132008. Manila. \n4  Most of the information in this section is from the published documents of the GMS project, which are accessible \n\nthrough the ADB website. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2 \n \nand  clean  energy,  to  strengthen  energy  security,  energy  efficiency,  and  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of energy resources. \n \n6. \nAnother  component  of  the  program  is  increased  and  sustained  investment,  from  both \nlocal and outside sources, through cooperative efforts. In support of this goal, (i) the institutional \nframework for investment promotion will be strengthened; and (ii) development partners and the \nprivate sector, within and outside the subregion, will be encouraged to invest in the GMS. \n \n7. \nA significant portion of the population of the GMS still has no access to modern forms of \nenergy.  In  2008,  24%,  or  about  70  million  people,  had  no  access  to  electricity.  Eighty-three \npercent  of  all  households  in  Cambodia,  80%  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \n(Lao PDR),  and  over  50%  in  Viet  Nam  still  use  wood  for  fuel. 5  Clearly,  sustainable  energy \ninvestments must increase in the target countries. \n\n2. \n\nSouth Asia \n\n8. \nThe statistics for the South Asian countries are often worse. Most of these countries lag \nbehind  in  energy  sector  development,  despite  their  significant  (but  underdeveloped)  natural \nresource  potential.  In  Nepal,  only  48%  of  the  population  in  2007  had  access  to  electricity  and \nother  modern  forms  of  energy.6  Institutional,  technical,  and  financial  limitations  constrain  the \ndevelopment of its rich hydropower resources. \n \n9. \nIn Bangladesh and Bhutan, half of the populations lack access to electricity. The policies \nand  institutions  in  these  two  countries  are  weak  but  are  being  strengthened  with  the  help  of \nmultilateral  organizations  such  as  ADB,  the  United  Nations,  and  the  World  Bank  Group.  In \nBangladesh, ADB is supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of the \nenergy,  transport,  education,  and  other  infrastructure  sectors  that  are  critical  to  sustainable \ndevelopment.7  Bhutan,  for  its  part,  is  striving  to  improve  its  policies  to  increase  private  sector \nparticipation  (especially  foreign  direct  investment)  in  hydropower  and  other  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.8 \n\nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy 20209 provides a context within ADB\u2019s primary goal of poverty reduction \n10. \nin the region for (i) all member countries to become low-carbon economies over the long term to \nmitigate  the  effects  of  climate  change,  and  (ii)  those  countries  to  attain  energy  security  while \nsustaining  economic  development  through  the  use  and  expansion  of  clean  energy  sources. \nWhile the public sector has a major role in realizing these objectives, Strategy 2020 also looks \nforward  to  the  greater  participation  of  the  private  sector.  The  strategy  thus  provides  for \nincreased support for private sector business activities in sustainable clean energy. \n\n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

The GMS \nsubregional  cooperation  business  plan, 10  together  with  other  GMS  documents,  sets  a  clear \nagenda for clean energy programs in the GMS countries. The Energy Strategic Thrust I under \nthe GMS program of action in the medium term11 refers to broader energy cooperation through \nimproved  energy  security  and  sustainable  resource  development,  including  subregional \ncooperation  in  renewable  energy.  The  objectives  of  the  GMS  program  for  the  energy  sector \nwere  expanded  in  the  GMS  midterm  review  to  include  the  development  of  alternative  and \nrenewable sources of energy, energy efficiency, and energy security.12  \n \n12. \nThe goals and programs defined in the regional cooperation operations business plan for \nSouth  Asia13  also  involve  increasing  energy  investments  and  improving  the  energy  mix  in  the \nsubregion with a bias toward renewable sources. Among the five key operational objectives of \nADB\u2019s strategy for South Asia14 are cooperation in energy and private sector participation.  \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategies \n\nThe  proposed  investment  is  broadly  aligned  with  the  country  strategies  for  the  various \n\n13. \ncountries to be targeted by the fund. Examples of this are as follows: \n \nCambodia.  In  its  country  operations  business  plan,15  Cambodia  is  concerned  mainly \n14. \nwith using the GMS cooperation program to pursue its renewable energy development agenda, \nparticularly to widen access to energy through rural electrification. The strategy also fosters the \nactive participation of the private sector in the various hard infrastructure investments that must \nbe made, particularly in agriculture and energy, for a sustainable future. This complements the \npublic  sector's  various  interventions  in  improving  access  of  the  population  to  reliable  and \naffordable power supply.  \n \n15. \nNepal and Bangladesh. According to the midterm review of Nepal\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy6,  inefficiency,  unpredictability,  and  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability  in  key \nenergy  service  institutions  are  the  main  impediments  to  energy  sector  development.  For \nBangladesh,  the  challenges  are  similar.  Thus,  in  these  two  countries  ADB  assistance  will  be \ndirected  at  improving  governance  and  efficiency  in  the  power  sector  and  encouraging  private \nsector  participation.    This  also  supports  the  public  sector's  initiatives  to  improving  rural \nelectrification and renewable energy access necessary for the countries' broad-based economic \ngrowth. \n \n16. \nSri Lanka. Given the country\u2019s recent high deficits, and its need to sustain its economic \ndevelopment  path,  its  high  dependence  on  oil  imports  could  be  very  costly  to  Sri  Lanka.  The \ncountry  partnership  strategy 16  identifies  opportunities  that  could  help  prevent  future  supply\u2013\ndemand imbalances, such as the adoption of renewable energy and other environment-friendly \nalternative energy sources. To complement this effort, the strategy also supports the application \nof energy efficiency measures in all sectors. The private sector is recognized to be an important \ndriver  in  realizing  these  opportunities,  while  the  public  sector  is  expected  to  lead  the  needed \n\n                                                \n \n10 ADB. 2008.

Energy  sector  and  private  sector  development  are  likewise  priorities  for \nThailand. Among the five key strategies behind the national development plan, as stated in the \ncountry partnership strategy,17 is economic restructuring for increased productivity, investment, \nand  competitiveness.  Infrastructure  development,  capital  market  development,  and  energy \nefficiency improvements, particularly new investments in energy security, are core elements of \nthis strategy. The country\u2019s operations business plan18 highlights the need for expanded private \nsector  operations,  and  for  ADB\u2019s  assistance  with  cofinancing,  private  sector  participation,  and \nspecialized expertise for complex projects. This private sector involvement will supplement the \npublic  sector's  large  program  of  mainstreaming  energy  efficiency  measures  and  promoting \nenergy conservation in country's municipal governments. \n \nViet  Nam.  Viet Nam\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  2009\u2013201119  emphasizes \n18. \nthe need for new climate change and renewable energy interventions. ADB, through its public \nsector window, will also assist the government in promoting clean energy and expanding rural \nelectrification,  particularly  to  households  in  underserved  areas.  Several  of  these  public  sector \nactivities include the implementation of clean energy and power generation projects all over the \ncountry. The plan recognizes the role of the private sector in providing additional resources on \ntop  of  public  sector  funding  for  energy  infrastructure\u2014ultimately  strengthening  public\u2013private \npartnership in energy sector development. \n\n4. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s new Energy Policy20 defines the role of the private sector in securing the energy \n19. \nneeds  of  the  region.  The  policy  encourages  private  sector  participation  (and  public\u2013private \npartnership)  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency  through  competition  and  an  increase  in \ninvestable  resources  in  DMCs.  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development  organizations  have \npoured capital into this sector through public sector loans and other financing mechanisms for \nclean  energy  projects.  However,  the  investment  has  been  insufficient  to  build  and  sustain  the \nincreasingly energy-intensive infrastructure and economic activities. The private sector must fill \nthe gap, by allocating financial resources and technical expertise for clean energy businesses in \nthe  DMCs,  particularly  the  target  countries  in  the  GMS  and  South  Asia  (which  lag  far  behind \nDMCs such as the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] and India in this regard).  \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned from Previous Operations \n\nKey  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  evaluation  study  of  the  energy  sector  in  the  GMS 21 \n20. \nreleased in 2008 are to: (i) promote other energy investments besides power trading and focus \nmore attention on clean energy investments, in line with ADB\u2019s initiatives for energy efficiency \nand  climate  change;  and  (ii)  expand  cofinancing  by  leveraging  ADB\u2019s  resources  to  mobilize \nfinancing  from  the  private  sector  and  other  development  partners.  A  recent,  separate \nindependent  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  GMS  program22  rated  it  successful  overall,  identifying  some \nlessons  that  are  relevant  to  the  program\u2019s  next  phases  of  implementation.  These  lessons \ninclude a recognition that coordination within the GMS energy program and between energy and \nother sectors (e.g., the private sector) could still improve. Two relevant recommendations of this \n\n \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2007. Country Partnership Strategy: Thailand, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n18 ADB. 2008.

This project generates synergies \nbetween public sector efforts in the various target countries, and the private sector investments \nthat will be made through the fund, and also aligns with ADB's focus (that has been articulated \nthroughout recent funds operations) on underinvested countries and sectors.    \n\nC. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe key output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of the fund itself, which will \nbe  considered  successful  if  the  fund  raises  at  least  $80  million  within  1  year  after  the  initial \nclose.24  Other  outputs  will  include  the  various  activities  of  the  fund  as  it  moves  through  the \ninvestment  process,  i.e.,  as  investment  opportunities  are  identified,  screened,  and  evaluated; \nfinancially  viable  investments  are  made;  the  portfolio  is  monitored  and  value  is  added  to  the \ninvestments made; and divestments from the investments yield a commercial return to the fund. \nThese  outputs  will  increase  the  flow  of  funding  and  expertise  in  clean  energy  projects  in  the \ntarget  regions  (outcome)  through  the  fund\u2019s  investment  in  at  least  10  clean  energy  and \nenvironment  projects  or  companies  by  2014,  and  the  fund  manager\u2019s  ongoing  management \nadvice to those investees. As a result, the sustainable energy sectors in the DMCs will develop \nover  time,  and  the  private  sector  will  contribute  more  to  the  clean  energy  and  environment \nsectors (impact).  \n\n2. \n\nImpact \n\n23. \nAs mentioned in para. 23, the ultimate development impact of the proposed investment \nwill  be  sustainable  energy  development  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  particularly  in  the  target  countries  in \nthe  GMS  and  South  Asia,  as  well  as  private  sector  development  in  the  clean  energy  and \nenvironment sectors. These objectives will be facilitated through the following channels: \n\na. \n\nSustainable Energy Security and Economic Development \n\n24. \nIn light of ADB\u2019s goal of securing the energy needs of its DMCs, the fund will invest in \nclean  energy  projects  to  augment  public  or  private  sector\u2013led  projects,  thus  bridging  the  gap \nbetween  the  available  supply  of  and  actual  demand  for  energy  in  these  countries.  As \nsustainable  energy  supply  is  achieved  through  the  public  and  private  sector  initiatives, \ncompetition will result in more efficient power markets and more affordable power prices for the \nmillions  of  industrial,  commercial,  and  domestic  end-users  in  the  region.  Access  to  affordable \nenergy for these end-users could lead to more business opportunities and investments, and in \nturn to more jobs and higher living standards for the population.  \n\n                                                \n \n23 ADB. 2008.

The sector, \nas  a  result,  is  often  undercapitalized.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  fund  will  help  to  provide  a \nmeasure  of  confidence  to  the  private  sector  that  investing  in  the  clean  energy  sector  in  these \nDMCs \ninducing  more-active  and \nmore-confident private sector participation.  \n \nBesides investing in the growth and expansion of existing clean energy companies, the \n26. \nfund is also expected to invest in early-stage projects, resulting in local start-up companies and \njob creation that can help sustain employment in the region. \n \nThe  Fund  will  provide  management  advice  to  entrepreneurial  companies  on  financial \n27. \nplanning,  project  development,  business  expansion  strategies,  human  resource  development, \ntechnology,  environmental  and  social  issues,  and  the  implementation  of  international  best \npractices  in  corporate  governance,  thus  raising  the  quality  of  individual  companies.  As \ncompanies  in  the  industry  are  forced  to  compete  for  market  share  and  financing,  the  whole \nindustry will gain in sophistication and efficiency. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nClimate Change Mitigation \n\n28. \nADB has affirmed its strong support for efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nThe  proposed  investment  in  the  fund  can  directly  and  indirectly  contribute  to  this  particular \nagenda,  particularly  on  the  mitigation  side.  The  clean  energy  projects  in  which  the  fund  will \ninvest  will  substantially  reduce  GHG  emissions  in  the  target  countries  versus  the  baseline \nscenario of carbon-intensive energy projects that would otherwise be developed. \n \nADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for  the  Regional  Review  of  the  Economics  of  Climate \n29. \nChange  in  Southeast  Asia25  gives  insights  into  the  significant  economic  costs  that  would  be \nincurred  if  nothing  is  done  to  combat  climate  change.  A  similar  study  is  being  done  for  South \nAsia (Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia, a subproject under ABD\u2019s technical \nassistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia).26 Given the need to build \na low-carbon and climate-resilient society, the prospective project investments of the fund can \nhave  an  obvious  and  significant  role.  Once  clean  energy  projects  are  in  place  and  are \ncommercially  viable,  the  countries  in  these  subregions  can  substantially  lower  their  carbon \nfootprint  in  the  medium  to  long  term  by  investing  in  further  projects,  thereby  reducing  the \neconomic costs associated with climate change. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nA. \n\nOwnership \n\nThe  fund  manager  will  be  Dragon  Capital  Clean  Development  Investments  Ltd., \n30. \nincorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The fund manager is owned by Dragon Capital Group \n(Dragon), an integrated asset management company with a focus on Viet Nam\u2019s capital markets. \nEstablished  in  1994,  Dragon  is  among  the  largest  and  most  experienced  asset  managers  in \nViet Nam, with total assets in excess of $1 billion.  \n \n\n                                                \n \n25 ADB. 2007.

Technical Assistance for the Development Partnership Program in South Asia. Manila (TA 6337-REG). \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nDragon employs over 100 people based in Bangkok in Thailand,27 Ho Chi Minh City and \n31. \nHa  Noi  in  Viet  Nam,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  It  has  a  lengthy  track  record  of  investing,  and \ncurrently  manages  six  funds  in  Viet  Nam\u2014three  public  equity  market  funds,  one  fixed-income \nfund, one natural resources fund, and one real estate fund\u2014which are listed on exchanges in \nIreland and Luxembourg, and in London.  \n \n32. \nDragon has a well-established research team that covers a large number of companies \nin  the  Viet  Nam  market.  It  has  worked  for  many  years  with  the  Vietnamese  government  and \nmajor financial institutions in Viet Nam. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n1. \n\nManagement \n\n33. \nDragon has put together an experienced management team for the fund. The investment \nteam of the fund manager is composed of individuals whose backgrounds combine experience \nin project development, investment, deal origination, and clean energy technology.  \n\n2. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\nThe  fund  will  have  an  advisory  board,  comprising  certain  institutional  investors,  to \n34. \nrepresent the interests of the investors, supervise the fund\u2019s operations, and advise and guide \nthe fund manager. ADB will be represented on the advisory board.  \n\n3. \n\nRisk Management \n\n35. \nThe  fund  manager  will  manage  risk  through  its  investment  process,  which  involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed \npredominantly  of  independent  members  with  extensive  experience  in  clean  energy  and \ninvestment management.  \n\nC. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objectives and Policies \n\n36. \nThe  fund  aims  to  provide  investors  with  stable,  long-term  capital  growth  and  cash \ndistributions  by  investing  in  clean  energy  and  environment  projects  in  the  target  countries  in \nGMS  and  South  Asia.  The  partnership  will  attempt  to  achieve  its  objective  by  making \ninvestments  that  meet  the  \u201ctriple  bottom  line\u201d  principles  of  \u201cpeople,  planet,  and  profit\u201d\u2014values \nthat would require that each investment have  a positive impact on the environment and make \ncontributions to sustainable development. The  embedding of environmental sustainability in its \nbusiness  model  will  drive  the  fund  manager  to  comply  with  the  requirement  that  each \ninvestment  should:  (i)  meet  or  exceed  domestic  environmental  and  social  regulations  and \nrequirements;  (ii)  demonstrate  a  significant  contribution  to  reductions  in  GHG  emissions, \nozone-depleting  substances,  and  other  pollutants;  and  (iii)  comply  with  the  environmental  and \nsocial guidelines of ADB.  \n\n                                                \n \n27  The Bangkok office was established recently to assist in the operations of the fund. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Strategy \n\n37. \nThe target investment subsectors are categorized into three primary areas: (i) renewable \nenergy  (including  energy  production  [hydro,  solar,  wind,  biomass,  biogas]  and  energy \nequipment); (ii) energy efficiency (including energy-efficient process [heat, sensors, combustion, \ninsulation]  and  energy  efficiency  products);  and  (iii)  conservation  (including  natural  resource \nconservation, industrial wastewater and solid waste treatment, and recycling).  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nADB Intervention and Transaction Structure \n\nADB proposes to make an equity investment of up to $15 million in the fund or 25% of \n38. \nthe fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. ADB will not be the single-largest investor in the \nfund. The targeted fund size is $100 million, with a first closing of a minimum of $40 million. The \nfund  has  been  well  received  by  other  development  financial  institutions,  including  the  Belgian \nInvestment Company for Developing Countries, the Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, and \nthe Netherlands Development Finance Company.  \n\nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n39. \nThere are a number of justifications for ADB\u2019s support of this investment. ADB\u2019s primary \nvalue addition in this investment is its catalytic role in the fund-raising being undertaken by the \nfund, which should encourage private investors and other multilateral and bilateral development \npartners to bring in more capital to the fund. This will help to develop the capital markets in the \nregion by filling the gap that currently exists vis-\u00e0-vis risk capital for clean energy projects. ADB \nhas  also  been  instrumental  in  assisting  the  fund  manager  in  conceptualizing  the  fund  and  its \nclean energy investment strategy.  \n \n40. \nAnother important value addition of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund is the guarantee that \nsustainable  development  issues  and  concerns  are  addressed  in  every  investee  project  of  the \nfund,  particularly  with  respect  to  balancing  the  varying  priorities  of  economic  development \nobjectives,  environmental  protection,  and  social  equity \nthe  different  DMCs.  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies and procedures will help to guide the fund at every \nstep in ensuring the sustainability of its future clean energy projects. This is an important value \naddition, since the fund\u2019s target countries frequently possess fragile and exploited environments \nas a result of prior uncontrolled industrial activity, as well as the possible existence of vulnerable \ncommunities  including  indigenous  groups  or  ethnic  minorities  who  may  be  adversely  affected, \nand to which ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies and procedures may apply.  \n \n41. \nGiven the significant need for private investments in the target countries in the GMS and \nSouth  Asia,  ADB\u2019s  intervention  through  the  fund  will  help  mobilize  capital  to  support  other \nprivate equity funds to pursue this path. It will help to develop a class of new fund managers and \nfinancial  professionals  in  the  sustainability  sectors  in  the  target  region\u2019s  more  challenging \neconomies. \n \n42. \nThe fund, similar to others in which ADB invests, will make a direct contribution to private \nsector development. The fund will employ market-based mechanisms to develop profitable and \nsustainable enterprises in the sectors that need them the most. ADB\u2019s contribution to this type \nof  initiative  helps  its  DMCs  to  implement  their  respective  country-specific  private  sector \ndevelopment strategies. \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n43. \nADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  fund  is  classified  as  category  FI  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and as category C under both ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The fund will be required to establish and implement an \nappropriate environmental and social management system (ESMS) for its investee companies \nto  meet  national  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  in  the  countries  in  which  these  companies  are \nlocated. ADB will coordinate with the fund manager to ensure that the ESMS is adopted prior to \ndisbursement for the first investment, and implemented in environmental and social safeguards \ndue diligence, monitoring, and reporting.  \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nThe  fund  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  fund  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  fund  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nAs  mentioned,  the  fund  manager  will  be  incorporated  in  the  British  Virgin  Islands,  an \n45. \noffshore  financial  center  (OFC)  and  common  location  of  incorporation  for  funds  and  fund \nmanagers. The fund itself will be incorporated in Guernsey, Channel Islands, another commonly \nused  OFC.  Incorporation  in  an  OFC  allows  the  fund  and  its  investors  to  avoid  excessive \ntaxation, as a result of the British Virgin Islands\u2019 own tax regulations and the tax treaties that it \nhas  with  other  countries.  Having  undertaken  its  own  due  diligence  of  this  matter,  ADB  is \nsatisfied  that  the  fund  will  not  be  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism. \n\nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nFollowing  the  approval  of  the  proposed  investment  by  ADB's  Board  of  Directors,  ADB \n\n46. \nwill enter into suitable documentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n47. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ninvestment  of  up  to  $15,000,000  to  the  Mekong  Brahmaputra  Clean  Development  Fund,  L.P. \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n26 November 2009 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nenergy \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \n \nSustainable \ndevelopment in DMCs \n \nsector \nPrivate \nthe \ndevelopment \nclean  energy  and/or \nenvironment  sectors  in \nDMCs \n\nin \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators \n\n \n \nImprovement  by  2022a \nin \nclean \nthe \nenergy/environment \nsector  from  the  2007 \nmeasured \nlevel, \nthrough: \n \n(i)  50% increase in \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\n \n \nDMC government reports;c  \nenergy \nfrom \nstatistics \nIEA,e  or  APEC; \nADB,d \nWorld \nBank\u2019s  World \nDevelopment Indicatorsf\n \n \nOngoing \ncompany  reports \nfund \n \n \n\nfund  portfolio \nthe \n\nto \n\npower generation \ncapacities from \nrenewable energy \nprojects in target \nDMCs \n\n \n(ii)  20% decrease in \npower cost in \nDMCs \n\n \n(iii) 5% reduction in \n\ngreenhouse gas (in \ntons CO2 \nequivalent) \nachieved through \nthe fund-assisted \nprojects in DMCsb \n\n \n(iv) 200 additional jobs \ncreated by the \nfund\u2019s investee \ncompanies \n\n \n(v)  5 additional private \n\nequity funds \ncreated in the \nregion \n\n \n \n \nThe  fund  invests  in  at \nclean \n10 \nleast \ntechnology  projects  by \n2014a\n \nleverages \nThe \nprivate \npublic \nand \nfunding of at least $160 \nmillion by 2014 \n \nfund  manager \nThe \ninvests  in  and  provides \nmanagement  advice  to \nat least 10 investees \n\nfund \n\nOutcome \n \nIncrease \nflow  of \nin \nfunding and expertise in \nclean \ntechnology \nprojectsg  in  the  target \nregions h\n \n   \n\n \n \nQuarterly \nreports of the fund \n \nADB evaluation reports \n\nand \n\nannual \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nthat \n\ntechnologies \n\nAssumptions \n \nTargeted  DMC  governments \nmaintain legal and regulatory \nframeworks \nfacilitate \nprivate  equity  investments  in \nclean technology projects \n \nTargeted  DMC  governments \ncontinue  to  implement  their \npollution  control  laws  and \nthe  adoption  of \nsupport \nclean \nin  all \nsectors \n \nData  on  energy  supply  and \ndemand,  electrification,  new \nand \njobs \ncreated, \nenvironmental \nquality \nparameters  are  gathered \nand \ntargeted \nDMCs \n \nRisk \n \nThe  global  recession  may \nlast for several years, limiting \neconomic \nopportunities \navailable \n \n\nreported \n\nin \n\nAssumptions \n \nAdequate  demand  exists  for \ntechnology \nclean \ninvestments  in  the  targeted \nDMCs \n \nThird-party  debt  and  other \nfinancing \nare \navailable to provide leverage \nfor the fund\u2019s investments \n \nInvestees  of  the  fund  are \nwilling  to  accept  the  fund\u2019s \nadvice \ntheir \nto \nbusiness operations \n \n\nschemes \n\nimprove \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \n \nThere  is  market  interest  to \ninvest  in  clean  technology \nprojects in targeted DMCs \n \nThe \nfinds \nfund  manager \nattractive  clean  technology \ninvestment opportunities \n \nThe fund manager invests in \ncapable \nopportunities \nof \ncommercially \ngenerating \nattractive returns \n \nThe fund manager is able to \nfind  appropriate  exit  routes \nfor investments \n \n\nInputs \n \n \nADB: $15 million \nOther investors: $20 million \n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nOutputs \n \n1.
