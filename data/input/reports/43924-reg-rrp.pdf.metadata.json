I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $15 million in Mekong Brahmaputra Clean Development Fund, L.P. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Aggressive development throughout Asia has put substantial pressure on the region\u2019s \nresource  base  and  has  strained  the  buffering  capacity  of  the  environment.  Unhampered \nextraction of carbon-based fossil resources such as coal and oil to meet the region\u2019s expanding \nenergy needs has added to the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to global \nclimate change and harm the environment. This development path will need to be balanced \nover the long term with more sustainable alternatives.  \n \n3.  Despite rapid development, many developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) do not have affordable power for large portions of their populations \nbecause energy investment cannot keep up with demand. Some DMCs in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS)1 and in South Asia,2 whose energy sectors are less developed than those of \ntheir peers, obviously need attention. Because of policy, financial, and technical limitations, they \nhave  not  achieved  their  vast  potential  for  clean  energy  resource  development  and  clean \ntechnology use. Investing in a clean energy sector fund that would provide more capital to \nalternative energy and environment sector projects in the region would help overcome the \nfinancial limitations.  \n \n4.  Investment in clean energy projects in these target DMCs is low primarily because \n(i) energy policy frameworks do not adequately support or encourage clean energy projects, and \n(ii) the countries have limited financial and technical expertise in this sector. On the policy side, \nADB\u2019s  public  sector  departments  have  been  proactively  addressing  and  working  with  the \ncountry governments in the GMS and South Asia through regional cooperation strategies and \nprograms. But, especially given the DMC governments\u2019 limited resources, the private sector \nmust  also  mobilize  funds  for  energy  as  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms  are  made.  To \nachieve energy security the public and private sectors should thus complement each other in \ninvesting in clean energy in the target DMCs. The private sector can efficiently mobilize funds \nfor the sector through various means, including long-term private equity. \n1.  Greater Mekong Subregion \n5.  The  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program 3  for  energy  foresees  a \ncompetitive regional market that facilitates the optimal development and use of the subregion\u2019s \nenergy resources, contributing significantly to economic development and reducing poverty. 4 \nThe development of regional power trade will enable the GMS countries to lower power costs, \nstabilize supply, and reduce GHG emissions. The GMS program also looks forward to wider \ncooperation in the energy subsectors, including alternative energy sources such as renewable \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014collectively referred to in this \nreport as \u201cthe target countries in the GMS.\u201d \n2  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka\u2014referred to here as as \u201cthe target countries in South Asia.\u201d \n3  ADB.  2004.

Another component of the program is increased and sustained investment, from both \nlocal and outside sources, through cooperative efforts. In support of this goal, (i) the institutional \nframework for investment promotion will be strengthened; and (ii) development partners and the \nprivate sector, within and outside the subregion, will be encouraged to invest in the GMS. \n \n7.  A significant portion of the population of the GMS still has no access to modern forms of \nenergy. In 2008, 24%, or about 70 million people, had no access to electricity. Eighty-three \npercent  of  all  households  in  Cambodia,  80%  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \n(Lao PDR), and over 50% in Viet Nam still use wood for fuel.5 Clearly, sustainable energy \ninvestments must increase in the target countries. \n2.  South Asia \n8.  The statistics for the South Asian countries are often worse. Most of these countries lag \nbehind in energy sector development, despite their significant (but underdeveloped) natural \nresource potential. In Nepal, only 48% of the population in 2007 had access to electricity and \nother modern forms of energy.6 Institutional, technical, and financial limitations constrain the \ndevelopment of its rich hydropower resources. \n \n9.  In Bangladesh and Bhutan, half of the populations lack access to electricity. The policies \nand institutions in these two countries are weak but are being strengthened with the help of \nmultilateral organizations such as ADB, the United Nations, and the World Bank Group. In \nBangladesh, ADB is supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of the \nenergy, transport, education, and other infrastructure sectors that are critical to sustainable \ndevelopment.7 Bhutan, for its part, is striving to improve its policies to increase private sector \nparticipation (especially foreign direct investment) in hydropower and other renewable energy \ndevelopment.8 \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n10.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 20209 provides a context within ADB\u2019s primary goal of poverty reduction \nin the region for (i) all member countries to become low-carbon economies over the long term to \nmitigate the effects of climate change, and (ii) those countries to attain energy security while \nsustaining economic development through the use and expansion of clean energy sources. \nWhile the public sector has a major role in realizing these objectives, Strategy 2020 also looks \nforward  to  the  greater  participation  of  the  private  sector.  The  strategy  thus  provides  for \nincreased support for private sector business activities in sustainable clean energy. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008. Evaluation Study: Energy Sector in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2007. Country Partnership Strategy Midterm Review: Nepal, 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n7   ADB. 2005.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "  3\n2.  Consistency with Subregional Strategies \n11.  The GMS and South Asia in particular will need more private sector investment to \ncomplement the limited public sector spending on sustainable energy infrastructure. The GMS \nsubregional cooperation business plan,10 together with other GMS documents, sets a clear \nagenda for clean energy programs in the GMS countries. The Energy Strategic Thrust I under \nthe GMS program of action in the medium term11 refers to broader energy cooperation through \nimproved  energy  security  and  sustainable  resource  development,  including  subregional \ncooperation in renewable energy. The objectives of the GMS program for the energy sector \nwere expanded in the GMS midterm review to include the development of alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy, energy efficiency, and energy security.12  \n \n12.  The goals and programs defined in the regional cooperation operations business plan for \nSouth Asia13 also involve increasing energy investments and improving the energy mix in the \nsubregion with a bias toward renewable sources. Among the five key operational objectives of \nADB\u2019s strategy for South Asia14 are cooperation in energy and private sector participation.  \n3.  Consistency with Country Strategies \n13.  The proposed investment is broadly aligned with the country strategies for the various \ncountries to be targeted by the fund. Examples of this are as follows: \n \n14.  Cambodia. In its country operations business plan,15 Cambodia is concerned mainly \nwith using the GMS cooperation program to pursue its renewable energy development agenda, \nparticularly to widen access to energy through rural electrification. The strategy also fosters the \nactive participation of the private sector in the various hard infrastructure investments that must \nbe made, particularly in agriculture and energy, for a sustainable future. This complements the \npublic  sector's  various  interventions  in  improving  access  of  the  population  to  reliable  and \naffordable power supply.  \n \n15.  Nepal and Bangladesh. According to the midterm review of Nepal\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy6,  inefficiency,  unpredictability,  and  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability  in  key \nenergy  service  institutions  are  the  main  impediments  to  energy  sector  development.  For \nBangladesh, the challenges are similar. Thus, in these two countries ADB assistance will be \ndirected at improving governance and efficiency in the power sector and encouraging private \nsector  participation.    This  also  supports  the  public  sector's  initiatives  to  improving  rural \nelectrification and renewable energy access necessary for the countries' broad-based economic \ngrowth. \n \n16.  Sri Lanka. Given the country\u2019s recent high deficits, and its need to sustain its economic \ndevelopment path, its high dependence on oil imports could be very costly to Sri Lanka. The \ncountry partnership strategy16 identifies opportunities that could help prevent future supply\u2013\ndemand imbalances, such as the adoption of renewable energy and other environment-friendly \nalternative energy sources. To complement this effort, the strategy also supports the application \nof energy efficiency measures in all sectors. The private sector is recognized to be an important \ndriver in realizing these opportunities, while the public sector is expected to lead the needed \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.

Energy  sector  and  private  sector  development  are  likewise  priorities  for \nThailand. Among the five key strategies behind the national development plan, as stated in the \ncountry partnership strategy,17 is economic restructuring for increased productivity, investment, \nand  competitiveness.  Infrastructure  development,  capital  market  development,  and  energy \nefficiency improvements, particularly new investments in energy security, are core elements of \nthis strategy. The country\u2019s operations business plan18 highlights the need for expanded private \nsector operations, and for ADB\u2019s assistance with cofinancing, private sector participation, and \nspecialized expertise for complex projects. This private sector involvement will supplement the \npublic sector's large program of mainstreaming energy efficiency measures and promoting \nenergy conservation in country's municipal governments. \n \n18.  Viet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s country operations business plan for 2009\u2013201119 emphasizes \nthe need for new climate change and renewable energy interventions. ADB, through its public \nsector window, will also assist the government in promoting clean energy and expanding rural \nelectrification, particularly to households in underserved areas. Several of these public sector \nactivities include the implementation of clean energy and power generation projects all over the \ncountry. The plan recognizes the role of the private sector in providing additional resources on \ntop of public sector funding for energy infrastructure\u2014ultimately strengthening public\u2013private \npartnership in energy sector development. \n4.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n19.  ADB\u2019s new Energy Policy20 defines the role of the private sector in securing the energy \nneeds of the region. The policy encourages private sector participation (and public\u2013private \npartnership)  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency  through  competition  and  an  increase  in \ninvestable resources in DMCs. ADB and other multilateral development organizations have \npoured capital into this sector through public sector loans and other financing mechanisms for \nclean energy projects. However, the investment has been insufficient to build and sustain the \nincreasingly energy-intensive infrastructure and economic activities. The private sector must fill \nthe gap, by allocating financial resources and technical expertise for clean energy businesses in \nthe DMCs, particularly the target countries in the GMS and South Asia (which lag far behind \nDMCs such as the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] and India in this regard).  \n5.  Lessons Learned from Previous Operations \n20.  Key recommendations of ADB\u2019s evaluation study of the energy sector in the GMS21 \nreleased in 2008 are to: (i) promote other energy investments besides power trading and focus \nmore attention on clean energy investments, in line with ADB\u2019s initiatives for energy efficiency \nand climate change; and (ii) expand cofinancing by leveraging ADB\u2019s resources to mobilize \nfinancing  from  the  private  sector  and  other  development  partners.  A  recent,  separate \nindependent evaluation of ADB\u2019s GMS program22 rated it successful overall, identifying some \nlessons  that  are  relevant  to  the  program\u2019s  next  phases  of  implementation.  These  lessons \ninclude a recognition that coordination within the GMS energy program and between energy and \nother sectors (e.g., the private sector) could still improve. Two relevant recommendations of this \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2007. Country Partnership Strategy: Thailand, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n18 ADB. 2008.

", "  5\nevaluation are for ADB to (i) design a revised GMS strategy using a holistic approach, which \nwould include private sector participation in infrastructure development and would strengthen \nconnectivity among the GMS countries; and (ii) identify other development partners, as well as \npartners from the private sector and the GMS member countries that could bridge the financing \ngap in the GMS program, especially for integrated multisector projects. \n \n21.  Key recommendations of ADB's evaluation study of private equity funds23, in addition to \na number of general suggestions (e.g. enhancing staffing, risk management systems, and \nportfolio management), included: (i) strengthening country programming arrangements so there \nis better coordination in development of the nonbank financial sector, and (ii) articulating an \noperational strategy that sets out target countries and sectors. This project generates synergies \nbetween public sector efforts in the various target countries, and the private sector investments \nthat will be made through the fund, and also aligns with ADB's focus (that has been articulated \nthroughout recent funds operations) on underinvested countries and sectors.    \nC.  Development Impact \n1.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n22.  The key output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of the fund itself, which will \nbe considered successful if the fund raises at least $80 million within 1 year after the initial \nclose.24 Other outputs will include the various activities of the fund as it moves through the \ninvestment process, i.e., as investment opportunities are identified, screened, and evaluated; \nfinancially viable investments are made; the portfolio is monitored and value is added to the \ninvestments made; and divestments from the investments yield a commercial return to the fund. \nThese outputs will increase the flow of funding and expertise in clean energy projects in the \ntarget  regions  (outcome)  through  the  fund\u2019s  investment  in  at  least  10  clean  energy  and \nenvironment projects or companies by 2014, and the fund manager\u2019s ongoing management \nadvice to those investees. As a result, the sustainable energy sectors in the DMCs will develop \nover time, and the private sector will contribute more to the clean energy and environment \nsectors (impact).  \n2.  Impact \n23.  As mentioned in para. 23, the ultimate development impact of the proposed investment \nwill be sustainable energy development in ADB\u2019s DMCs, particularly in the target countries in \nthe GMS and South Asia, as well as private sector development in the clean energy and \nenvironment sectors. These objectives will be facilitated through the following channels: \na.  Sustainable Energy Security and Economic Development \n24.  In light of ADB\u2019s goal of securing the energy needs of its DMCs, the fund will invest in \nclean energy projects to augment public or private sector\u2013led projects, thus bridging the gap \nbetween  the  available  supply  of  and  actual  demand  for  energy  in  these  countries.  As \nsustainable  energy  supply  is  achieved  through  the  public  and  private  sector  initiatives, \ncompetition will result in more efficient power markets and more affordable power prices for the \nmillions of industrial, commercial, and domestic end-users in the region. Access to affordable \nenergy for these end-users could lead to more business opportunities and investments, and in \nturn to more jobs and higher living standards for the population.  \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2008. Special Evaluation Study: Private Equity Fund Operations. Manila. \n24  The initial close is scheduled before the end of the first quarter of 2010. \n ", "6   \n \n  b.  Private Sector Participation and Development \n25.  Unlike private investors in the PRC and India, private investors in the target countries \nare often reluctant to invest in clean energy projects because of the inherent risks. The sector, \nas a result, is often undercapitalized. ADB\u2019s participation in the fund will help to provide a \nmeasure of confidence to the private sector that investing in the clean energy sector in these \nDMCs  is  both  operationally  and  economically  viable,  thus  inducing  more-active  and \nmore-confident private sector participation.  \n \n26.  Besides investing in the growth and expansion of existing clean energy companies, the \nfund is also expected to invest in early-stage projects, resulting in local start-up companies and \njob creation that can help sustain employment in the region. \n \n27.  The Fund will provide management advice to entrepreneurial companies on financial \nplanning, project development, business expansion strategies, human resource development, \ntechnology,  environmental  and  social  issues,  and  the  implementation  of  international  best \npractices  in  corporate  governance,  thus  raising  the  quality  of  individual  companies.  As \ncompanies in the industry are forced to compete for market share and financing, the whole \nindustry will gain in sophistication and efficiency. \n  c.  Climate Change Mitigation \n28.  ADB has affirmed its strong support for efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nThe proposed investment in the fund can directly and indirectly contribute to this particular \nagenda, particularly on the mitigation side. The clean energy projects in which the fund will \ninvest will substantially reduce GHG emissions in the target countries versus the baseline \nscenario of carbon-intensive energy projects that would otherwise be developed. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  for  the  Regional  Review  of  the  Economics  of  Climate \nChange in Southeast Asia25 gives insights into the significant economic costs that would be \nincurred if nothing is done to combat climate change. A similar study is being done for South \nAsia (Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia, a subproject under ABD\u2019s technical \nassistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia).26 Given the need to build \na low-carbon and climate-resilient society, the prospective project investments of the fund can \nhave  an  obvious  and  significant  role.  Once  clean  energy  projects  are  in  place  and  are \ncommercially viable, the countries in these subregions can substantially lower their carbon \nfootprint in the medium to long term by investing in further projects, thereby reducing the \neconomic costs associated with climate change. \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Ownership \n30.  The  fund  manager  will  be  Dragon  Capital  Clean  Development  Investments  Ltd., \nincorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The fund manager is owned by Dragon Capital Group \n(Dragon), an integrated asset management company with a focus on Viet Nam\u2019s capital markets. \nEstablished in 1994, Dragon is among the largest and most experienced asset managers in \nViet Nam, with total assets in excess of $1 billion.  \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2007.

Dragon employs over 100 people based in Bangkok in Thailand,27 Ho Chi Minh City and \nHa Noi in Viet Nam, and the United Kingdom. It has a lengthy track record of investing, and \ncurrently manages six funds in Viet Nam\u2014three public equity market funds, one fixed-income \nfund, one natural resources fund, and one real estate fund\u2014which are listed on exchanges in \nIreland and Luxembourg, and in London.  \n \n32.  Dragon has a well-established research team that covers a large number of companies \nin the Viet Nam market. It has worked for many years with the Vietnamese government and \nmajor financial institutions in Viet Nam. \nB.  Governance Structure \n1.  Management \n33.  Dragon has put together an experienced management team for the fund. The investment \nteam of the fund manager is composed of individuals whose backgrounds combine experience \nin project development, investment, deal origination, and clean energy technology.  \n2.  Corporate Governance \n34.  The  fund  will  have  an  advisory  board,  comprising  certain  institutional  investors,  to \nrepresent the interests of the investors, supervise the fund\u2019s operations, and advise and guide \nthe fund manager. ADB will be represented on the advisory board.  \n3.  Risk Management \n35.  The fund manager will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed \npredominantly  of  independent  members  with  extensive  experience  in  clean  energy  and \ninvestment management.  \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n1.  Investment Objectives and Policies \n36.  The  fund  aims  to  provide  investors  with  stable,  long-term  capital  growth  and  cash \ndistributions by investing in clean energy and environment projects in the target countries in \nGMS  and  South  Asia.  The  partnership  will  attempt  to  achieve  its  objective  by  making \ninvestments that meet the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d principles of \u201cpeople, planet, and profit\u201d\u2014values \nthat would require that each investment have a positive impact on the environment and make \ncontributions to sustainable development. The embedding of environmental sustainability in its \nbusiness  model  will  drive  the  fund  manager  to  comply  with  the  requirement  that  each \ninvestment  should:  (i)  meet  or  exceed  domestic  environmental  and  social  regulations  and \nrequirements;  (ii)  demonstrate  a  significant  contribution  to  reductions  in  GHG  emissions, \nozone-depleting substances, and other pollutants; and (iii) comply with the environmental and \nsocial guidelines of ADB.  \n                                                 \n27  The Bangkok office was established recently to assist in the operations of the fund. \n ", "8   \n \n2.  Investment Strategy \n37.  The target investment subsectors are categorized into three primary areas: (i) renewable \nenergy  (including  energy  production  [hydro,  solar,  wind,  biomass,  biogas]  and  energy \nequipment); (ii) energy efficiency (including energy-efficient process [heat, sensors, combustion, \ninsulation] and energy efficiency products); and (iii) conservation (including natural resource \nconservation, industrial wastewater and solid waste treatment, and recycling).  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Intervention and Transaction Structure \n38.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment of up to $15 million in the fund or 25% of \nthe fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. ADB will not be the single-largest investor in the \nfund. The targeted fund size is $100 million, with a first closing of a minimum of $40 million. The \nfund has been well received by other development financial institutions, including the Belgian \nInvestment Company for Developing Countries, the Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, and \nthe Netherlands Development Finance Company.  \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n39.  There are a number of justifications for ADB\u2019s support of this investment. ADB\u2019s primary \nvalue addition in this investment is its catalytic role in the fund-raising being undertaken by the \nfund, which should encourage private investors and other multilateral and bilateral development \npartners to bring in more capital to the fund. This will help to develop the capital markets in the \nregion by filling the gap that currently exists vis-\u00e0-vis risk capital for clean energy projects. ADB \nhas also been instrumental in assisting the fund manager in conceptualizing the fund and its \nclean energy investment strategy.  \n \n40.  Another important value addition of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund is the guarantee that \nsustainable development issues and concerns are addressed in every investee project of the \nfund,  particularly  with  respect  to  balancing  the  varying  priorities  of  economic  development \nobjectives,  environmental  protection,  and  social  equity  in  the  different  DMCs.  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies and procedures will help to guide the fund at every \nstep in ensuring the sustainability of its future clean energy projects. This is an important value \naddition, since the fund\u2019s target countries frequently possess fragile and exploited environments \nas a result of prior uncontrolled industrial activity, as well as the possible existence of vulnerable \ncommunities including indigenous groups or ethnic minorities who may be adversely affected, \nand to which ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies and procedures may apply.  \n \n41.  Given the significant need for private investments in the target countries in the GMS and \nSouth Asia, ADB\u2019s intervention through the fund will help mobilize capital to support other \nprivate equity funds to pursue this path. It will help to develop a class of new fund managers and \nfinancial  professionals  in  the  sustainability  sectors  in  the  target  region\u2019s  more  challenging \neconomies. \n \n42.  The fund, similar to others in which ADB invests, will make a direct contribution to private \nsector development. The fund will employ market-based mechanisms to develop profitable and \nsustainable enterprises in the sectors that need them the most. ADB\u2019s contribution to this type \nof  initiative  helps  its  DMCs  to  implement  their  respective  country-specific  private  sector \ndevelopment strategies. ", "  9\nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n43.  ADB\u2019s investment in the fund is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and as category C under both ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The fund will be required to establish and implement an \nappropriate environmental and social management system (ESMS) for its investee companies \nto meet national laws and ADB\u2019s requirements in the countries in which these companies are \nlocated. ADB will coordinate with the fund manager to ensure that the ESMS is adopted prior to \ndisbursement for the first investment, and implemented in environmental and social safeguards \ndue diligence, monitoring, and reporting.  \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  The fund was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  fund  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the fund will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n45.  As mentioned, the fund manager will be incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, an \noffshore  financial  center  (OFC)  and  common  location  of  incorporation  for  funds  and  fund \nmanagers. The fund itself will be incorporated in Guernsey, Channel Islands, another commonly \nused  OFC.  Incorporation  in  an  OFC  allows  the  fund  and  its  investors  to  avoid  excessive \ntaxation, as a result of the British Virgin Islands\u2019 own tax regulations and the tax treaties that it \nhas  with  other  countries.  Having  undertaken  its  own  due  diligence of  this  matter,  ADB  is \nsatisfied that the fund will not be used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or the \nfinancing of terrorism. \nC.  Assurances \n46.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB's Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable documentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ninvestment of up to $15,000,000 to the Mekong Brahmaputra Clean Development Fund, L.P. \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n26 November 2009 \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nSustainable  energy  Improvement by 2022a  DMC government reports;c  Targeted DMC governments \ndevelopment in DMCs  in  the  clean  energy  statistics  from  maintain legal and regulatory \n  energy/environment  ADB,d  IEA,e  or  APEC;  frameworks  that  facilitate \nPrivate  sector  sector  from  the  2007  World  Bank\u2019s  World  private equity investments in \ndevelopment  in  the  level,  measured  Development Indicatorsf clean technology projects \nclean  energy  and/or  through:     \nenvironment sectors in      Targeted DMC governments \nDMCs  (i)  50% increase in  Ongoing  fund  portfolio  continue to implement their \npower generation  company  reports  to  the  pollution  control  laws  and \ncapacities from  fund  support  the  adoption  of \nrenewable energy    clean  technologies  in  all \nprojects in target    sectors \nDMCs   \n  Data on energy supply and \n(ii)  20% decrease in  demand, electrification, new \npower cost in  jobs  created,  and \nDMCs  environmental  quality \n  parameters  are  gathered \n(iii) 5% reduction in  and  reported  in  targeted \ngreenhouse gas (in  DMCs \ntons CO    \n2\nequivalent)  Risk \nachieved through   \nthe fund-assisted  The  global  recession  may \nprojects in DMCsb  last for several years, limiting \n  economic  opportunities \n(iv) 200 additional jobs  available \ncreated by the   \nfund\u2019s investee \ncompanies \n \n(v) 5 additional private \nequity funds \ncreated in the \nregion \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nIncrease  in  flow  of  The fund invests in at  Quarterly  and  annual  Adequate demand exists for \nfunding and expertise in  least  10  clean  reports of the fund  clean  technology \nclean  technology  technology  projects  by    investments in the targeted \nprojectsg  in  the  target  2014a ADB evaluation reports  DMCs \nregions h    \n  The  fund  leverages  Third-party  debt  and  other \n    private  and  public  financing  schemes  are \nfunding of at least $160  available to provide leverage \nmillion by 2014  for the fund\u2019s investments \n   \nThe  fund  manager  Investees  of  the  fund  are \ninvests in and provides  willing  to  accept  the  fund\u2019s \nmanagement advice to  advice  to  improve  their \nat least 10 investees  business operations \n ", "  Appendix 1  11\nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Technical Assistance for Energy Sector Strategy and Development. Manila (TA 6322-REG). \nThe intended outcome is to develop and recommend strategies that ADB needs to adopt in its lending operations to further \nenhance the effectiveness of its energy sector assistance to DMCs along the four priority areas highlighted in the 2000 \nreview. One expected output of this regional technical assistance is the development of an ADB energy outlook and \ndatabook that will cover regular updates on energy statistics of DMCs. \ne  International Energy Agency. 2009.
