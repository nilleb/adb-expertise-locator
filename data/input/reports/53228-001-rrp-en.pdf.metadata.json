(LAV).1 \n \n2. \nLAV  is  a  private  equity  fund  established  as  a  Cayman  Islands  exempted  limited \npartnership with an expected fund size of $200 million\u2013$250 million. LAV\u2019s general partner, which \nwill also act as its manager, is Lombard Asia Management Limited, a newly established Cayman \nIslands exempted company (Lombard Asia Management). Lombard Asia Management\u2019s adviser \nwill be the Private Equity (Thailand) Company Limited (PETCL), a Thai limited company. \n \n3. \nLAV is expected to make equity and equity-linked investments in midsized companies in \nAsia,  primarily  in  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  and  selectively  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Myanmar. 2 LAV  is  expected  to  pursue  investments  in \nsectors  that  include  (i)  agriculture  logistics,  transport,  and  retailing;  (ii)  education;  (iii)  food \nproducts;  (iv)  financial  services;  (v)  health  care;  (vi)  hospitality  and  restaurants;  (vii)  human \nresources and outsourcing; (viii) light manufacturing and construction materials; and (ix) media \nand  entertainment. 3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  not  classified  the  proposed \ninvestment as part of its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response because of the wide-ranging \nsectors being targeted by Lombard Asia. The majority of these are unlikely to be directly linked to \nCOVID-19-related  health  care  initiatives  and/or  are  not  intended to  provide  short-term  liquidity \nsupport for companies in LAV\u2019s target countries. Instead, the aims of ADB\u2019s investment are to \nprovide growth equity to a range of middle-market companies in Southeast Asia (many of which \nhave been negatively impacted by COVID-19), to mobilize capital from third-party sources, and \nto promote best practice safeguards and governance standards. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nDescription. LAV was established in January 2019 with the intention of being managed \nand advised by Lombard Investments Inc. and its affiliated companies (the Lombard platform).4 \nThe  Lombard  platform  was  established  in  the  United  States  (US)  in  1985  to  invest  in  middle-\nmarket private equity opportunities in Asia and North America. Since 1997, the Lombard platform \nhas managed and advised four Asia-focused investment vehicles, which had total assets under \nmanagement of about $1.09 billion as of 30 June 2020.5 The Lombard platform currently has two \nongoing Asia-focused funds\u2014Lombard Asia III, L.P. (LAIII) and Lombard Asia IV, L.P. (LAIV)\u2014\nwith its prior fund, the Thailand Equity Fund (TEF), being fully divested. Since 1997, the Lombard \nplatform, comprising a combination of US- and Asia-based professionals, increased its hiring of \nlocally based investment and management teams and has opened offices in Bangkok; Ho Chi \n\n \n\n1  The commitment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be the greater of $10 million or 10% of LAV\u2019s total capital \n\ncommitments, capped at $20 million. \n\n2  LAV may invest a limited portion of its capital in other countries in Asia, subject to certain restrictions. ADB will have \nexcusal  rights  in  relation  to  any  investment  that  is  not  in  an  investee  company  operating  in  one  of  its  specified \ndeveloping member countries. \n\n3 A climate change target amount has not been specified as this is an equity investment into a fund (as opposed to a \ndirect investment into a company) and hence, the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet known. \n4  The  Lombard  platform  currently  consists  of  Lombard  Investments  Inc.;  Lombard  Holdings,  LLC;  Lombard  Asia \nAdvisors LLC; Lombard Asia III, L.P. (LAIII); Lombard Asia IV GP; Lombard Asia IV, L.P. (LAIV); PETCL; Lombard \nInvestments (HK) Limited; and its Viet Nam representative office). \n\n5  LAIV ($359 million); LAIII ($234 million); the Thailand Equity Fund (TEF) ($245 million); and Lombard Asian Private \n\nInvestment Company LDC ($252 million). \n\n\fMinh City; and Hong Kong, China while retaining its San Francisco office for US-based members.6 \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n It is proposed that LAV will now be managed and advised by Lombard Asia Management \n5. \nand its affiliates (Lombard Asia).

Further information is set out in para. 16. \nThree  other  members  of  Lombard  Asia\u2019s  senior  management  team  have \nconsiderable  experience  with  the  Lombard  platform.  Specifically,  Aongorn \nSomprasong was promoted to managing director of PETCL in 2017 and has been \nwith the Lombard platform for 7 years. Ekaluck Wangchucherdkul was promoted \nto  managing  director  of  PETCL  in  2017  and  has  also  been  with  the  Lombard \nplatform for 7 years. Mai Nguyen was promoted to director of PETCL in 2017 and \nhas been with the Lombard platform for 4 years. Other management members\u2014\nKalaya  Uahwatanasakul,  Chaniporn  Chitvarakorn,  Plengchat  Triyawatanyu,  and \nNapol  Kamthornkittikul\u2014are  all  current  members  of  the  Lombard  platform\u2019s \ninvestment and management teams. \n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \n8. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \nB. \n \n9. \nLAV\u2019s strategy aims to take advantage of changes in Southeast Asia\u2019s markets driven by \ncompetitive, regulatory, and/or technological developments. Specifically, these relate to (i) growth \nin service industries, including financial services, health care, hospitality, entertainment, media \nand logistics; (ii) increases in domestic demand in segments benefiting from rising middle-class \nconsumption;  and  (iii)  growth  in  export-driven  businesses  with  a  sustainable  competitive \nadvantage.  Factors  influencing  Lombard  Asia\u2019s  target  choice  of  markets  include  (i)  under \npenetration of private equity financing in Thailand relative to the economy\u2019s size (bank lending is \n\n \n\n6  Team Composition and Track Record (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) shows how the \nAsia-based management and investment team of the Lombard platform has expanded from the TEF (2001) through \nto LAIII (2007) and LAIV (2013).  \n\n7  ADB.

Lombard \nAsia  expects  demand  for financing from  private equity to increase  after COVID-19  because  of \nexpected reduced flows of capital into more challenging and frontier markets. \n \n10. \nLAV intends to build a diversified portfolio of equity and equity-linked minority investments \nin small to medium-sized growth-oriented companies in Southeast Asia in sectors where Lombard \nAsia has prior expertise. LAV is expected to focus on growth opportunities in companies whose \noperations are located primarily in Thailand and Viet Nam and, to a lesser extent, in Myanmar, \nCambodia, and the Lao PDR. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception \nto disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n11. \nThe management team of Lombard Asia has a large network of contacts and relationships \ngenerated from its experience in Southeast Asia working as part of the Lombard platform. The \nnetwork  includes  family  conglomerates;  local  and  regional  investors  (including  institutional \ninvestors);  networks  of  legal,  accounting,  advisory,  and  business  professionals;  government \nagencies;  and  company  managers  and  entrepreneurs  (including  executives  from  portfolio \ncompanies of the Lombard platform\u2019s prior funds). \n \nC. \n \n12. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]  \n \n13. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n14. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n15. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n16.

The chair of PETCL and proposed chair of LAV\u2019s investment committee, \nPote  Videt,  has  18  years  of  experience  with  the  Lombard  platform  and served  as  a  managing \ndirector  for  Credit  Suisse  First  Boston  and  Goldman  Sachs  prior  to  joining.  He  is  a  Harvard \nBusiness  School  graduate  and  has  had  several  roles  advising  the  Government  of  Thailand \n(including  briefly  acting  as  the  deputy  minister  for  commerce  in  1997).  The  senior  managing \ndirector of PETCL, Surasak Khaoroptham, has 17 years of experience with the Lombard platform, \nprior to joining PETCL. He worked in several senior strategic advisory roles in Southeast Asia for \nThai Airways and Credit Suisse First Boston.

Women are significantly underrepresented among the \ninvestment decision-makers at private equity and venture capital firms in Asia, accounting for 18% \nof employees on average and just 12% of senior roles.9 Lombard Asia\u2019s figures are above industry \naverages, with four women in its proposed management team of twelve investment professionals, \ntwo of whom are members of LAV\u2019s investment committee. \n \n18. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n19. \nAdvisory committee.

The  investment  seeks  to  contribute  to  private  sector \ndevelopment, improve investor confidence, and boost job creation in medium-sized companies in \nSoutheast  Asia  (noting  that  the  services  sector accounts for  a  substantial  share  of  developing \nAsia\u2019s output, employment, and growth).10 The investment aims to contribute to efforts to counter \nCOVID-19-related  economic  shock  waves,  supply-chain  disruptions,  and  labor  shortages.  The \neconomic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are disproportionately hitting low- and middle-income \ncountries  and  the  poor.  Countries  in  Southeast  Asia  have  fewer  support  systems  and  less \ncapacity to withstand shocks than developed economies, which poses heightened risks. \n \nCatalytic  anchor  role.  While  the  market  opportunity  in  Southeast  Asia  is  increasingly \n26. \nattractive,  there  is  a  large  unmet  demand  for  private  sector  financing;  many  medium-sized \ncompanies continue to face difficulties in accessing financing without fixed assets to pledge as \ncollateral.  Asian  banks  have  stepped  back  because  of  regulations  that  impose  relatively  strict \nrules for bank capital adequacy requirements and expanding portfolios of nonperforming loans.11 \nIn this sense, ADB seeks to play a catalytic role in helping to attract capital to the region during \nan unprecedented time because of COVID-19 impacts. \n \nIncreased  gender  inclusiveness.  As  reflected  by  the  effective  gender  mainstreaming \n27. \nrating  for  this  transaction,  gender  equality  has  become  an  important  element  of  the  Lombard \nplatform\u2019s  operations,  and  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  LAV  is  expected  to  introduce  new  gender \nelements  for  LAV.  This  includes  Lombard  Asia  introducing  a  gender  equality  scorecard  for \nevaluating  potential  investee  companies  and  implementing  an  internal  anti-sexual-harassment \npolicy (with associated training).12 \n \nE. \n \n28. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n29. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n30. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n31. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n\n \n\n10 D.

The project is aligned with the following impact: access to critical growth equity \n32. \nfor middle-market companies in Southeast Asia improved at a time when few companies have \ncapital  available  for  new  initiatives  and  when  financial  institutions  and  investors  are  becoming \nincreasingly risk averse from pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n33.  Outcome  The  project\u2019s  outcome  is  the  demonstration  of  financial  sustainability  and \noperational value addition of private equity investments in middle-market companies in Southeast \nAsia. \n \n34.  Outputs.  The  outputs  of  the  project  include  the  successful  establishment  of  LAV,  LAV \ncapital  deployed  to  support  greater  gender  equality  and  economic  development  across  ADB\u2019s \ntarget sectors, and enhancement of gender equality of Lombard Asia\u2019s operations. \n \nB. \n \n35. \nConsistency with ADB strategy. ADB\u2019s investment in LAV aligns with several of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  operational  priorities,  including  priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequalities), whereby LAV would be providing much-needed growth capital for middle-\nmarket companies in Southeast Asia, supporting small business, and creating new jobs.13 LAV\u2019s \ncommitment  to  supporting  gender  equality,  as  reflected  by  the  proposed  effective  gender \nmainstreaming rating, aligns with operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality). \n \n36. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  The  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategies  for  Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Myanmar,  and  the  country \noperations  business  plan  for  Thailand  (for  which  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  is  being \ndeveloped), which seek to foster private sector development, support economic diversification, \npromote market development, and improve corporate governance. \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  investment  is \n37. \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations (2019\u20132024), which aims \nto efficiently deploy and mobilize equity capital to support a portfolio of mostly privately owned \nmiddle-market companies in realizing their expansion plans.15 The investment also allows ADB \nto  leverage the  local market knowledge  and domain  expertise  of  the  Lombard  Asia team,  and \nbroaden ADB\u2019s reach into sectors and/or countries where direct equity programs may have limited \npenetration (as co-investment opportunities may be presented to ADB). In line with the operational \nplan, ADB expects the investment to help spur overall economic growth by driving job creation, \ntax revenue generation, and technology adoption. \n \n38. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n14  \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \n\n13 ADB.  2018.

Currently,  approximately  33%  of  the  proposed  LAV \nteam  are  expected  to  be  women.  Following  discussions  on  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment,  Lombard  Asia  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities.17 Key features of the gender action plan include \n(i) using a gender equality scorecard to support Lombard Asia\u2019s decision-making regarding LAV\u2019s \ninvestments; (ii) providing recommendations to LAV\u2019s investees on how to improve their gender \nequality, e.g., additional female board members or implementation of an anti-sexual-harassment \npolicy; and (iii) developing a company-wide anti-sexual-harassment policy and training staff on \nthe policy.
