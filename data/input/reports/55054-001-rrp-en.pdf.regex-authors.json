THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Sustainable Urban Development and Service Delivery Program, \nand (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to India for subprogram 1 of the Sustainable Urban \nDevelopment and Service Delivery Program. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Urban Development and \nService Delivery, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program is the first national PBL in the urban sector in India. It is a \nprogrammatic PBL with two subprograms of $350 million each within the PBL period of 2021\u2013\n2023 and will be supported by the attached TA (paras. 32\u201333). It aims to improve access to basic \nurban services in India by accelerating a series of policy actions and reforms that will mainstream \nperformance-linked funding for urban service delivery. The program reforms will establish and \noperationalize (i) national and subnational policies, guidelines, and programs for accelerated \nachievement of universal water supply and improved sanitation service delivery with associated \nurban reforms; (ii) policies and programs for providing rental housing to urban migrant and \nindustrial workers, working women, and the poor; and (iii) policies and guidelines for performance-\nbased central fiscal transfers. Subprogram 1 will establish essential policies and guidelines at the \nnational level. Subprogram 2 will prepare and commence the specific reform actions and program \nproposals at state and urban local body (ULB) levels following the set policies and guidelines \nunder subprogram 1, which will be enforced through performance-based grants. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n  \n3.  India\u2019s economy. India was among the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies from fiscal \nyear (FY) 2013 to FY2020, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 6.6%, supported \nby  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  economic  development  policies  that  have \ncontributed to a substantial reduction in poverty.1 The central government\u2019s fiscal deficit averaged \n3.6% during FY2016\u2013FY2020, down from 4.8% in FY2011\u2013FY2015.2 GDP contracted sharply to \n\u20137.3% in FY2021 because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The government\u2019s \nstructural reforms\u2014such as the reduction in the corporate tax, introduction of the goods and \nservices tax, and streamlining of business processes to improve the ease of doing business\u2014\nhave helped to raise India\u2019s productivity and competitiveness. Building on these reforms, the \ngovernment launched Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Campaign) to initiate wider \neconomic  reforms\u2014including  measures  to  boost  manufacturing  competitiveness  with  job \ncreation, urban reforms, and infrastructure investments of $1.4 trillion during FY2019\u2013FY2025\u2014\nto accelerate inclusive economic transformation, and to stir post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  \n \n4.  GDP is expected to recover strongly, with growth of 9.5% in FY2022 and 8.5% in FY2023.3 \nAfter a sharp increase of public debt in FY2021 estimated at 90% of GDP, it is projected to decline \nto 85% of GDP by FY2027, reflecting lower deficits and favorable interest rate\u2013growth differential, \nbut debt will remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and gross financing needs are \n \n1  Computed from Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Plan Implementation.

The government\u2019s economic reforms focus on reviving \nthe investment momentum, attracting strong inflows of foreign investment, strengthening the rural \neconomy, encouraging start-ups, promoting domestic manufacturing, and addressing constraints \nto infrastructure growth. Although no standard methodology is in place for estimating urban GDP \nin India, based on estimates by the Central Statistics Office, private agencies, and researchers, \nthe urban share of GDP is estimated at average 60%.4 The country\u2019s general direction of \nmacroeconomic conditions and policies is deemed satisfactory. \n \n5.  Urbanization in India. India\u2019s urban population of 460 million in 2020 is the second largest \nin the world.5 However, as a share of the country\u2019s total population (34%), it is much less than the \nAsian average of 50%. India\u2019s urban population is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.01% \nover the next 3 decades to reach nearly 600 million by 2030 and 876 million by 2050.6 Estimates \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) suggest that, for developing Asia, a one percentage point \nincrease in urbanization is associated with 3%\u20135% higher real GDP per capita.7 Therefore, the \nurban sector must become a strong engine of growth for India to become an upper middle-income \ncountry, generating economic activity and outputs, creating jobs absorbing massive amounts of \nworkers,  improving  competitiveness  and  urban  livability,  and  protecting  environment.  As \nurbanization grows, there is also a significant increase in urban slums as rural poor migrate to the \ncities in search of better livelihood. As per 2011 census, about 65.5 million or 17.4% of the urban \npopulation live in slums, which was estimated to have reached about 81 million by 2020. \n \n6.  Core development problem. Urban development in India has not been able to maximize \nthe economic benefits associated with increasing urbanization.8 With uncontrolled urbanization, \nmany cities are not equipped to provide basic urban services such as water supply, sanitation, \nand housing to their increasing urban populations.9 Poorly managed urbanization has curbed \nsocial gains, and compromised environmental sustainability, exposing many people to worsening \nclimate  and  disaster  risks.  Urban  sector  development  has  been  constrained  by  several \noverarching factors: (i) insufficient urban service delivery; (ii) limited progress in the nationwide \ndelivery of the urban reform agenda, with inadequate incentives for reforms; (iii) insufficient \nfunding to the urban sector; (iv) low financial capacity of ULBs, with overdependence on fiscal \ntransfers; and (v) evolving governance frameworks, which slow private sector participation in \nurban services delivery.10 These constraints are further described in paras. 7\u201311.  \n \n7.  Insufficient urban service delivery. There has been a strong bias towards adding \nphysical  infrastructure  rather  than  providing  financially  and  environmentally  sustainable \n \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA). 2019.

Only 53.5% are connected to underground drainage, and others dispose of their wastewater \nin covered surface drains (16.2%) or in an unsafe manner (27.8%). Wastewater treatment capacity is at 37%, which \nmeans that untreated sewage is dumped into water bodies and pollutes the environment. About 36.2% of urban \nhouseholds do not own a house, and 23.1% of urban householders are staying in rental housing without rental \ncontracts (Government of India, National Statistical Office. 2019. Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing \nCondition in India. NSS 76th Round. New Delhi). \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "3 \nservices.11 Indian cities score very low on the Ease of Living Index 2021 as urban investment \ndoes not target to incentivize improvement in urban service delivery.12 The urban poor, especially \nwomen, suffer from lack of tap water connections and poor sanitation services, which create \nunhealthy conditions, and result in high health risks and deprive women of income-generating \nactivities.  Water  bodies  are  polluted  and/or  silted  because  of  unplanned  urbanization  and \ninefficient drainage systems. Groundwater is being depleted because of over-abstraction. Water \ncharges are low and often do not meet even operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The urban \npoor gets pushed into slums or informal settlements. Insufficient supply of good quality affordable \nhousing undermines workforce productivity and the potential for economic gains.  \n \n8.  Need to fast-track progress on reforms. ULBs implement development plans and urban \ndevelopment strategies approved by states, and are responsible for providing urban services such \nas water, sanitation, and solid waste management.13 ULBs need to be empowered to plan and \ndeliver urban services through effective devolution and capacity building. The extent of urban \ndevelopment and sectoral reforms varies because of widely differing urban landscapes and \nsocioeconomic contexts across India. Past national urban missions\u2014such as the Jawaharlal \nNehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban \nTransformation (AMRUT),14 and Smart Cities Mission15 laid the foundation for urban reforms. \nHowever, the pace and quality of reforms have been below expectations as these national \nprograms focused on infrastructure investments and did not clearly articulate the service level \nstandards requirement. Certain qualitative and process-oriented reforms under those programs \nwere not linked to tangible service delivery outcomes.16 Also, there were no significant incentives \nprovided for the states and ULBs to undertake critical reforms measures. \n \n9.  Insufficient urban investment. The average annual capital expenditure required for the \nurban sector during FY2021\u2013FY2025, including covering shortfalls in previous years, is expected \nto be $45.7 billion, which equals 1.5% of GDP.17 Average annual grant support from the central \ngovernment since FY2015 has been about $7.7 billion. Though information on capital expenditure \nin the urban sector by various states is not consolidated, annual average capital expenditure in \nthe urban sector is estimated to be about $19 billion (equals 0.70% of GDP), of which ULB funding \nis no more than 20%. Therefore, the central and state governments together are estimated to \nfund about $15 billion (or 0.55% of GDP), indicating a significant shortfall. India is still in the early \nstages of implementing public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in the urban sector.18 Private sector \ninvestment in urban services is negligible for lack of bankable projects in the urban sector, \n \n11 The World Bank. 2011.

New Delhi. \n13 ULBs' main sources of revenue include property taxes, user fees for urban services, and fiscal transfers from the \nnational and state governments. \n14 AMRUT was launched in 2015 to improve urban services (water supply, sewerage and septage management, \nstormwater drainage, nonmotorized urban transport, and green space) in 500 selected towns with a population of \nmore than 0.1 million (2011 census) and some other towns. To date, about 5,891 projects worth $11.1 billion are \neither completed or under implementation, and the mission has provided 11.2 million water connections and \n8.7 million sewer connections to households and sewage treatment plants with a total capacity of 1,800 million liters \nper day. As part of municipal reforms, 468 ULBs were credit rated and nine ULBs raised municipal bonds under \nAMRUT. In addition, 439 ULBs have established online building permit systems as part of improved e-governance. \n15  MOHUA launched Smart Cities Mission in 2015 to promote 100 smart cities that provide core infrastructure, clean \nand sustainable environment and give decent quality of life to citizens through applicability of technological solutions. \n16 Reforms such as ULBs following double-entry accounting, preparing city level urban planning, creating municipal \nstaffing, conducting energy and water audits, were qualitative and process oriented. \n17 Government of India. 2020.

Infrastructure \nFinance, PPS, and Guarantees.  \n \n ", "4 \nbecause of inadequate municipal reforms in setting up affordable user charges for sustainable \noperations, limited mobilization of other revenues, and staff capacity constraints for delivering \nPPP transactions. \n \n10.  Low financial capacity of urban local bodies. The municipal finance system equals \nabout 1% of GDP. Financial support from the central and state governments increased from \n0.35% of GDP in FY2011 to 0.45% in FY2018.19 This occurred with increased attention to grant \nsupport for investments in urban infrastructure from both the national and state governments. \nWith growing demand for sustainable urban infrastructure and services, ULBs need to strengthen \ntheir capacity to mobilize their own revenues. ULBs\u2019 own-source revenue has remained low, equal \nto about 0.55% of GDP, because of slow pace of municipal finance reforms, lack of incentives to \nimplement reforms, and high dependence on government support. Ample scope exists to increase \nULB own-source revenues, not least by reforming the property tax regime. Property tax is a major \nsource of municipal revenue in many countries. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development show that average property tax collection for countries in the group \nequals to about 1.10% of GDP. In India, it has been 0.15%\u20130.20%, which is even less than the \naverage of 0.60% in developing countries, peers such as Malaysia and the Philippines collecting \n0.50% and Indonesia 0.30%.20  \n \n11.  Evolving governance framework. The government\u2019s first guiding framework for urban \ngovernance reforms started with the 74th constitutional amendment of 1992, which gave urban \nlocal governments a constitutional status as the third tier of governance. State governments are \nresponsible for defining key strategic policies, for example approving tariffs for urban services. \nThe central government continuously strives to shape the urban reform agenda with a view to \nempowering ULBs. It consistently provides discretionary financial support through fiscal transfers \nto the states and ULBs through its national urban programs, which has enabled increased urban \nexpenditure and asset creation in priority areas. However, it has not sufficiently translated into \nimproved service delivery to meet national benchmarks. This is partly because of the prevalence \nof input-based funding, with a limited focus on outcomes. The government also needs to promote \ndata-driven and participatory governance through a citizen feedback mechanism, and validation \nof ULB performance in urban service delivery in real time. \n \n12.  Alignment with government and ADB priorities. The Government of India intends to \nsignificantly accelerate national urban programs and associated reforms supported by the Ministry \nof Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA). The program aligns with the government\u2019s national \nprograms that promote cities as engines of economic growth by improving the quality of urban \nlife\u2014through the creation of high-quality urban infrastructure, assured service provisions, and \nefficient governance.21 The program aligns with the ADB country partnership strategy for India, \n2018\u20132022, which envisages inclusive urbanization by supporting investments in municipal \ninfrastructure, promoting municipal reforms, improving governance, and building capacity in ULBs, \n \n19 Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. 2019.

Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n13.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. The government, as a part of its COVID-19 economic \nrecovery reform initiative (para. 3), intends to significantly accelerate reforms in urban service \ndelivery. On 1 October 2021, the Prime Minister launched AMRUT 2.0, a national flagship urban \nwater mission, which aim to achieve universal coverage of piped water supply across all urban \nareas, and improved sanitation in 500 larger towns in the next 5 years.24 Under AMRUT 2.0, \ncentral government grant disbursements are linked to meeting the service delivery outcome \ntargets such as household water and sewerage or septage connections, as well as targeted \nreform incentives to ensure water security such as reducing NRW to less than 20%, rejuvenation \nof water bodies, reuse of treated wastewater to meet 20% of cities\u2019 water demand and 40% of \naggregate industry water demand at state level (Reform area 1). The government has also \nestablished a new urban rental housing program for migrant laborers and the poor to safeguard \ntheir livelihoods as COVID-19 recovery program (Reform area 2). Further, in line with the report \nof India\u2019s 15th Finance Commission, routine fiscal devolution is made conditional on local revenue \nimprovements, with yearly targets to reach 95% efficiency in the coverage and collection of \nproperty taxes and user charges (Reform area 3). 25  \n \n14.  The PBL modality is designed to accelerate the implementation of policy actions that are \ncrucial for structural urban reforms linked to (i) improving water supply and sanitation service \ndelivery outcomes and local revenue under AMRUT 2.0, with the aim of making cities water-\nsecure and climate resilient through circular water economies achieved through water source \nconservation, rejuvenation of water bodies, groundwater management, and the reuse of treated \nwastewater; (ii) enhancing access to affordable housing for the poor, migrant workers, industrial \nworkers,  and  working  women;  and  (iii) implementing  the  15th  Finance  Commission\u2019s \nrecommendation for performance-based fiscal transfers to the states and ULBs. A programmatic \napproach (vertical packaging of reforms) with two subprograms, each for $350 million, is proposed \nto support policy actions in a sequential manner at the national level (subprogram 1), and to \nensure that reforms are undertaken coherently at the state and ULB levels (subprogram 2) within \nthe PBL period of 2021\u20132023.26 All actions for subprogram 1 have been completed. Under \nsubprogram 1, critical policies at the central level are consolidated under three reform areas, to \n \n22 ADB. 2017.

Under subprogram 2, AMRUT 2.0 will be broken down into subcomponents such as \ncommencing implementation of holistic action plans by states and ULBs for improved service \ndelivery and reforms, and operationalizing and implementing policies at the state and ULB levels.  \n \n15.  Reform area 1: National and subnational policies and guidelines for universal and \nimproved  water  supply  and  sanitation  service  delivery  established.  AMRUT  2.0  was \napproved by the cabinet with financial outlay of over $37 billion, which aims to provide universal \ncoverage of piped water supply and improved sanitation coverage by providing 26.8 million new \nwater supply connections, and 26.4 million new sewerage or septage connections.27 The program \nwill disproportionately benefit urban poor and women not having piped water and sewerage \nconnections. Under subprogram 1, as per the government-approved AMRUT 2.0, MOHUA issued \nprogram implementation regulations through operational guidelines to the states, which articulate \nthe key strategic elements of (i) accelerated achievement of universal coverage of piped water \nsupply in 4,800 towns, and sewerage or septage management in 500 AMRUT towns, and \nincentive based reforms for reducing NRW to less than 20%, recycling and reuse of treated \nwastewater to meet 20% of water demand of ULBs, and O&M sustainability; (ii) rejuvenating \nurban water bodies to augment fresh water supply, with the objectives of developing green spaces \nto augment water conservation and amenity value, reducing flood impacts, maintaining a positive \ngroundwater balance; (iii)  projects amounting to at least 10% of the total project allocation for \ncities  with  population  above  1  million  to  be  mandatorily  taken  up  in  PPP  mode;  and  (iv) \nmainstreaming gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) measures in achieving universal \ncoverage of water supply and sanitation including involvement of women in water demand \nmanagement,  capacity  building,  O&M  of  assets,  behavior  change  communication,  and \ninformation, education, and communication strategies.  \n \n16.  Under subprogram 2, the MOHUA will operationalize the mission with state governments, \ncovering the following aspects: (i) at least 10 states will approve and commence implementation \nof state water action plans outlining annual targets (2023\u20132026) for providing universal coverage \nof piped water supply through tap connections to all urban households, and sewerage and/or \nseptage connections in AMRUT towns; (ii) following the memorandum of understanding signed \nbetween MOHUA, states and ULBs, the 10 states will enjoin at least 250 ULBs in those states to \ncarry out reforms under AMRUT 2.0, and allocate funds to ULBs annually based on identified \nfinancing gaps; (iii) at least 10 states will operationalize the policy guidelines for recycling and \nreusing water to meet 20% of their ULBs\u2019 water demand; (iv) at least 250 ULBs will begin \nimplementing action plans for continuous water supply with NRW reduction (2023\u20132026); and (v) \nat least 10 states will implement a policy or government order on user charges for water supply \nand sewerage, with periodic increases to recover O&M costs for sustainable operations and \nimprove collection efficiency. 28 MOHUA will operationalize a paperless AMRUT 2.0 monitoring \nsystem  to  promote  data-driven  and  participatory  governance,  using  a  technology-based \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) platform and a citizen feedback mechanism involving women \n \n27  AMRUT 2.0 has earmarked significant grant component of $290 million (3.25% of the central allocation) to support \nULBs in preparing and implementing various action plans, including detailed project reports, setting up of project \nmanagement and implementation units, cost of project development and management consultants, capacity building, \nand support in reforms implementation. Separate grant allocations are made for (i) project management at MOHUA \nlevel ($160 million); (ii) information, education, and communication campaigns ($90 million); and (iii) supporting \nimplementation of innovative environment-friendly technologies in water sector ($90 million). \n28 States and ULBs set up different user charges for non-domestic and domestic water consumers, including lower \ncharges for the poor, considering the affordability and equitability of the provision of services. \n \n ", "7 \nfor direct validation of ULBs\u2019 performance on an annual basis. MOHUA will roll out an e-learning \nplatform to sensitize ULBs with GESI in urban water supply service delivery. At least 10 states \nwill implement measures to mainstream GESI aspects in state water action plans to enhance \nservice delivery through women\u2019s participation in water management. MOHUA will institute a \npolicy for states for time-bound implementation of water body rejuvenation and operationalize \npolicy guidelines for inclusion of PPP component in state water action plans for cities with \npopulation above 1 million. At least 250 AMRUT towns operationalize policy guidelines by \ndeveloping  road  map  for  ground  water  recharge  augmentation  through  time-bound \nimplementation of urban aquifer management plans. \n \n17.  Reform area 2: Housing policies and programs to improve access to rental housing \nfor urban migrant and industrial workers, working women, and the poor established. This \nreform area focuses on Housing for All (PMAY-U), which is a very large, nationwide program \nlaunched in 2015 to build 11.3 million households at a total investment of nearly $100 billion.29 \nThe housing agenda has advanced following reforms such as the Real Estate (Regulation and \nDevelopment) Act, 2016; establishment of state real estate regulatory authorities; the Model \nTenancy Act, 2019; and the establishment of various state housing programs for the poor. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the reverse migration of urban migrant workers, industrial \nlaborers, and the poor, which has severely affected the sustainability of urban economic activities. \nUrban migrant workers, industrial laborers, working women, and the poor need decent rental \nhousing at affordable rates near their work sites. The government launched a program for \nproviding affordable rental housing complexes (ARHCs) for urban migrant and industrial workers, \nworking women, and the poor residing in unorganized settlements. 30 The outcome from this \nreform is significant as it will curb reverse migration trend and help in increasing labor productivity.  \n \n18.  Under subprogram 1, MOHUA approved (i) a policy for ARHCs to (a) provide universal \nshelter for urban migrant workers, industrial workers, and the poor in urban areas; (b) ensure \npreference in allotments for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes, widows, \nworking women, people with disability, minorities from economically weaker sections, and other \nlow-income groups; and (c) provide incentives to the concessionaires of ARHCs (e.g., exemptions \nfrom income tax, goods and services tax, and concessional loans); (ii) a policy to provide \ninnovation grants for projects that incorporate innovative technologies in affordable housing \nconstruction  including six  demonstration  projects;  and (iii)  policies  or directives  for  houses \ndeveloped by states to ensure barrier free accessibility following the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities Act, 2016; and to include rainwater harvesting systems to promote sustainable \nbuilding practices.  \n \n19.  Under subprogram 2, (i) at least 10 states will comply with ARHC policy guidelines for \nproviding shelter to urban migrant workers, industrial workers, working women, and the poor in \nurban areas by converting vacant government-funded houses into ARHCs through PPP or by \npublic  agencies,  or  incentivizing  public  or  private  entities  to  provide  ARHCs  on  their  own \nproperty;31 (ii) at least 10 states will implement guidelines for ULBs to operationalize a system for \ngenerating sex-disaggregated data on the beneficiaries to evaluate the inclusion of women and \n \n29 Under PMAY-U, about 76% households from economically weaker section category (household with annual income \nless than $4,025) will be benefitted. As of end-October 2021, about 8.86 million houses are grounded for construction, \nout of which 5.18 million have been completed with central assistance commitment of about $25 billion. \n30 ARHC is a sub-scheme under PMAY-U, which is expected to have investment of about $1 billion and will generate \n0.42 million direct and indirect jobs. Government of India, MOHUA. 2020. Affordable Rental Housing Complexes: \nOperational Guidelines. New Delhi. \n31 About 75,000 government-owned vacant dwelling units are targeted to be converted to ARHCs. In addition, new \nconstruction of 40,000 dwelling units and 180,000 dormitory units are targeted by public and private entities. \n \n ", "8 \ndisadvantaged groups; (iii) MOHUA will institute a policy for any state or concessionaire to \nincorporate at least 10 innovative and replicable technologies (e.g., green and climate resilient, \ncost-effective, speedier implementation,  or meeting  diverse  geo-climatic  conditions)  in their \nproposals for accessing MOHUA grants; and (iv) at least 10 states will comply with policy \nguidelines in the state housing projects under PMAY-U to include design features for older \npersons, women, children, and persons with disability; and provisions for rainwater harvesting \nsystem to promote sustainable building practices. \n \n20.  Reform  area  3:  Policies  and  guidelines  for  performance-based  central  fiscal \ntransfers to urban local bodies established. This reform area promotes performance-based \ncentral fiscal transfers based on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission. This \nreform will help improve local financial resource generation in ULBs, and will have a significant \nimpact  on  urban  governance  improvement.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Ministry  of  Finance \napproved operational guidelines for the states to implement the recommendation of the 15th \nFinance Commission progressively from FY2022 to FY2026 toward linking fiscal transfers to \nULBs to (i) urban service delivery improvements in water supply, sanitation, rainwater harvesting, \nand water recycling; (ii)  property tax collection reform; and (iii)  their timely submission of audited \naccounts and online disclosure of their accounts.32 \n \n21.  Under subprogram 2, (i) at least 10 states will comply with operational guidelines issued \nby the government through a memorandum of understanding with MOHUA, that include a \nbaseline for urban services as of 1 April 2021, and annual targets for achieving urban service \ndelivery benchmarks  until FY2026 through investments planned under AMRUT 2.0; (ii) at least \n10 states will amend state municipality and municipal corporation acts and rules on floor rates for \nproperty tax for different types of properties\u2014residential, commercial, and industrial\u2014to broaden \nthe tax revenue base;33 and (iii) at least 250 ULBs will (a) comply with municipal accounts \nmanuals and/or guidelines prepared by states based on the National Municipal Accounts Manual \npublished by MOHUA, and (b) disclose online by 31 December 2023 provisional accounts for \nFY2023 and audited accounts for FY2022. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s experience in the sector and lessons. ADB is a key development partner in \nIndia\u2019s urban sector. It has worked with various states since 1996 to support urban infrastructure \nand service delivery, institutional capacity building, policy advice, and sector reforms. ADB \nsupported JNNURM, the government\u2019s first nationwide urban mission, launched in 2005, through \nTA  to  ensure  (i) governance  reforms  in  states  and  ULBs,  (ii)  the  efficient  processing  and \nimplementation of interventions in ULBs, and (iii) the effective management and disbursement of \ngrant funds.34 In addition, ADB supported MOHUA\u2019s Smart Cities Mission. Lessons from ADB\u2019s \npolicy-based lending to make greater use of PBL in sectors where investment loans are also \nundertaken and ADB has experience, to ensure that policy constraints on the achievement of the \noverall development outcome, such as increased access to services, are supported by relevant \npolicy  reforms.35 The  relevant  reference  is  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector \n \nDevelopment Program, which comprises of a program financed by PBL to support policy reforms, \n \n32 15th Finance Commission has recommended fiscal transfer of $16.2 billion for the period FY2022 to FY2026, to be \nallocated to two categories of cities: (a) $5.1 billion is allocated for million plus cities ($1.6 billion linked to air quality \nimprovement, and the remaining $3.5 billion for meeting service level benchmark for water supply, sanitation and \nsolid waste management); and (b) $11.1 billion for other cities\u2014of which 60% ($6.6 billion) is earmarked equally for \n(i) drinking water, rainwater harvesting  and water recycling, and (ii) sanitation and solid waste management. \n33 ULBs are required to show consistent improvement in collection of property tax in line with at least the simple average \ngrowth rate of respective state\u2019s own GDP from FY2024 onwards.  \n34 ADB.

This is ADB\u2019s first national PBL in the urban sector in India, but it \nbuilds upon long engagement in urban sector at the state level. ADB has engaged with MOHUA \nand in various states toward implementing urban national flagship missions after JNNURM, such \nas AMRUT and the Smart Cities Mission, which have helped MOHUA design AMRUT 2.0. ADB\u2019s \nexperience has contributed to AMRUT 2.0, which, with ADB\u2019s policy support, will be widely \nreplicated through the mission. ADB helped MOHUA finalize guidelines for AMRUT 2.0 that \nincorporate a number of replicable elements demonstrated in ADB\u2019s interventions including NRW \nreduction; inclusive sanitation; and smart technologies such as supervisory control and data-\nacquisition  systems  to  support  high-quality,  efficient,  and  continuous  tap  water  supply  for \nconsumers; GESI and a poverty focus, and cost recovery through volumetric tariff collection. \nAMRUT 2.0 provides a significant platform for ADB to work with MOHUA and state governments \nto scale up and replicate these elements, with ADB providing policy advice on important and \ntimely urban sector reforms. Reform area 2 focuses on affordable rental housing scheme for the \npoor, working women, industrial workers, and migrant workers, the design of which is drawn on \nADB\u2019s rental housing project in Tamil Nadu. ADB was engaged with the Finance Commission and \nprovided inputs on the performance-based fiscal transfer to local governments.37 \n \n24.  In subprogram 2, ADB will support follow-up reform in states and ULBs by leveraging its \nexperience, working with development partners, and having dialogue at various government level \nto help states and ULBs improve service delivery through performance-linked financing. ADB\u2019s \nTA support focusing on lower-income states with capacity constraints will result in quality state \nand city level water action plans and proposals complying with AMRUT 2.0 guidelines by reflecting \nbest practices in project design including safeguards and GESI aspects, institutional mechanisms, \nand capacity building for effective program implementation. TA will also support (i) establishing \ndata-driven governance through a digital platform for effective mission M&E to ensure timely \ndelivery of outcomes, and (ii) public outreach and stakeholder consultations and engagement. \nExperiences and lessons from the program will be disseminated to other states in India and \nbeyond, as will international best practices, through knowledge publications, workshops, and \ninternational dialogues on key topics like municipal resource mobilization. These will be facilitated \nusing the Capacity Development Resource Center platform of ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission.  \n \n25.  Post-program engagement framework. ADB envisages continued engagement with the \ncentral and state governments alike in urban service delivery, financing, and policy advocacy \nthrough national flagship programs. The focus will be on lower-income states, which require \nsupport  in  capacity  building,  institution  strengthening,  and  policy  reform  implementation. \nEnvisaged as a future engagement is a potential state-level sector development program or \nresults-based lending that combines policy reforms and project investment under AMRUT 2.0, in \ncoordination with other development partners. This PBL could facilitate future investments in the \nurban water segment by private players through the One ADB approach.38 It would also provide \nopportunities for structuring PPP components under AMRUT 2.0 and ARHCs. Private sector \ninvestment is envisaged in projects such as water and sewage treatment plants, sewage water \nrecycling for industrial use, and municipal bonds. \n \n36 Independent Evaluation Department. 2020.

Sustainability. The reform agendas of AMRUT 2.0 and the 15th Finance Commission are \ngeared toward water security by reducing NRW, meeting 20% of water demand through recycled \nwater,  waterbody  rejuvenation,  groundwater  management,  and  toward  ensuring  financial \nsustainability through annual revision of user charges, property tax reform, ULB creditworthiness \nenhancement, and urban planning reforms. All reforms serve to increase climate resilience of the \nurban water sector. ADB will play an important role in implementing reforms in states and ULBs, \ndrawing on its vast experience in India and elsewhere in Asia. \n \n27.  Development partner coordination. Development partner support in the urban sector is \nguided by the country\u2019s policy direction and reform agenda. Given that urban planning and \ndevelopment are the responsibilities of individual states, most development partner support is \ndirected at the states. The World Bank recognizes urban livability and sustainability and air \npollution  control  as  key  development  challenges,  and  prioritizes  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, and affordable housing.39 The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) also \nprioritizes urban development and provide loans and TAs focused on urban transport, water \nsupply, and sewerage. The New Development Bank (NDB) is processing a $500 million loan to \nMOHUA for PMAY-U.40 ADB was engaged with AFD in conceptualizing their program for Smart \nCities Mission.41 The program team held consultations with the World Bank, JICA,  Department \nof International Trade, British High Commission in India, and the NDB to (i) maximize reform \nimpact and results; (ii) build partnership and cooperation, and ensure complementarity in program \nimplementation in states and ULBs; and (iii) share lessons. ADB has collaborated closely on fiscal \nprojections and broader macroeconomic analysis with the International Monetary Fund, which \nhas  provided  an  assessment  letter  for  the  program. 42 ADB  will  continue  to  engage  with \ndevelopment partners, including during the post-program phase, for a well-coordinated approach. \n  \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n28.  The program will assist state governments and ULBs in commencing implementation of \nnational  urban  flagship  programs  for  improving  access  to  basic  urban  services  for  water, \nsanitation, and housing as its outcome. It aligns with the country\u2019s overarching development \nobjective of rapidly transforming cities into economically vibrant and environmentally sustainable \nhabitats that provide equitable access to basic infrastructure, public services, and opportunities \nto all citizens, especially poor including women (footnote 21) over the longer term. Reforms of \nnational and subnational policies for universal and improved service delivery will ensure access \nto basic urban services such as water supply, sanitation, and affordable rental housing, especially \nfor the poor most affected by the pandemic.43 Performance-based reform-linked fiscal transfers \nwill ensure the sustainability of urban services and incentivize ULBs to generate local resources, \nand holistically address underlying urban constraints (paras. 6\u201311). The program will support the \npost- pandemic recovery by providing impetus for critical urban investments. 44  \n \n \n39 World Bank. 2018. Country Partnership Framework for India, 2018\u20132022.

ADB supported consultation, \nevaluation and selection of projects for financing. \n42 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 After completion of the PBL, states and ULBs are expected to commence implementation of national urban flagship \nprograms, which will take 5-7 years to complete. Improved access to basic services will only be fully realized after \ncompletion of civil works and all infrastructure is put in operation. \n44 Program Economic or Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n \n29.  The COVID-19 pandemic caused the government\u2019s fiscal deficit to increase significantly \nto 9.2% of GDP ($245.1 billion) in FY2021. It is estimated that it could gradually decrease to 6.8% \nof GDP ($201.1 billion) in FY2022 (budget estimate) and 5.4% of GDP ($203.2 billion) by FY2024, \nin  line  with  the  government\u2019s  targeted  fiscal  deficit\u2013GDP  ratio  of  4.5%  by  FY2026.45 The \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  needs  in  FY2022,  computed  as  the  sum  of  the  fiscal  deficit  and \nrepayments, will be met almost entirely from domestic sources that include market borrowings \n(dated securities), borrowings from financial institutions, and drawdown of cash balances. Gross \nexternal borrowings in FY2022 are expected to be $5,664.9 million, of which $2,090.2 million \n(36.9%) will be from ADB and the remainder from other sources, including other development \npartners. ADB\u2019s $350 million financing for subprogram 1 will account for 6.2% of the gross external \nborrowings and 0.17% of the government\u2019s fiscal deficit in FY2022.  \n \nTable 1: India\u2019s Central Government Financing Needs ($ million) \nFY2022  Proportion of \nBudget  Gross External \nNo.  Indicators  FY2021  Estimates  Borrowings \nA  Total receipts  227,721.9  263,812.8   \nB  Total expenditure  473,198.4  464,941.9   \nC=B-A  Fiscal deficit (net financing need)  245,476.5  201,129.1   \nD  Net domestic borrowings  236,006.1  200,927.0   \nE  Net external borrowings   9,470.4  202.1   \nF  External debt repayments  4,678.5  5,462.8   \nE+F  Gross external borrowings, of which  14,148.9  5,664.9   \n  ADB    2,090.2  36.9% \n  Other sources    3,574.7  63.1% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on data from the Government of India\u2019s Budget 2021\u20132022; and \nexchange rates from International Monetary Fund. 2021.

The \ngovernment has requested a regular loan of $350 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance subprogram 1.46 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-\nline method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  India will be the borrower of this loan. MOHUA will be the executing and implementing \nagency for the program. MOHUA will guide and monitor the implementation of the PBL. ADB will \nmonitor program implementation through regular missions and periodic reviews to (i) confirm the \nprogress and fulfillment of policy actions; (ii) monitor the continued applicability of the assumptions \nthat may impact program success, as well as specified risks and their mitigating measures; and \n(iii) advise on actions to maintain effective implementation within the program period.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n32.  Attached  TA  will  provide  knowledge  and  advisory  support  to  MOHUA  and  state \ngovernments toward rolling out policy reforms under AMRUT 2.0 in states and ULBs, mainly under \nsubprogram 2. The TA has two outputs: (i) MOHUA\u2019s capacity to manage, implement, monitor, \nand evaluate the reform program under AMRUT 2.0 strengthened; and (ii) capacity of states and \nULBs to prepare and implement AMRUT 2.0 and related programs strengthened. The first output \nwill help MOHUA (i) develop guidelines and establish mechanisms to monitor the implementation \nof AMRUT 2.0,47 (ii) capture lessons from AMRUT 2.0 implementation, and (iii) strengthen the \ncapacity  of  the  AMRUT 2.0  program  management  unit.  The  guidelines  will  ensure  that \ncrosscutting issues, such as climate change and GESI mainstreaming, are addressed. TA \nresources will be used to implement key GESI actions. The second output is designed to facilitate \nthe high-quality preparation of AMRUT2.0 programs and implementation of reforms including \nmunicipal resource mobilization, prioritizing lower-income states having capacity constraints, \nwhich can be replicated by other states and ULBs. TA will help ULBs and states prepare \ninvestment plans and provide recommendations on safeguards assessment and monitoring. 48  \n \n33.  TA is estimated to cost $1,670,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \nADB will administer the TA.49 The government will undertake policy actions with TA support; and \nidentify opportunities for expanding, strengthening, and sustaining reforms in states and ULBs \nincluding  preparation  of  AMRUT  2.0  projects.  The  TA  will  begin  in  January  2022  and  be \nimplemented over 30 months until June 2024. TA implementation arrangements will align with the \nprogram implementation arrangements. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n34.  Economic. The program team qualitatively assessed the PBL. The program is expected \nto have the following positive economy-wide impacts: (i) improved access to drinking water and \nsanitation services, as well as improved access to affordable housing for migrant workers, \nindustrial workers, working women, and the poor, will have health benefits and reduce the disease \nburden on urban residents, especially women, thereby enhancing labor productivity; (ii) policy \nprovision for ARHCs and viability gap funding for PPP projects in the water sector will help attract \nprivate sector investment in the urban sector; (iii) ULBs will be incentivized and supported to \ndevelop institutional capacity, take ownership, and develop decentralized demand-driven urban \nservices,  as  well  as  improve  service  quality  as  their  financial  envelope  expands  through \nperformance-linked central fiscal transfers, reduced NRW, increased property tax collection, and \nperformance improvements that reduce the cost of service delivery and create efficiencies; (iv) \nwater resources management will be improved by reusing wastewater, managing groundwater \n \n47 The TA will support preparation of guidelines for states and ULBs to prepare quality city water balance plan, city \nwater action plan, aquifer management plan, and water rejuvenation plans. \n48 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n49 All consultants will be recruited following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). All \ndisbursements under the TA will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time). \n \n ", "13 \naquifers, rejuvenating water bodies, and setting water tariffs that reflect O&M costs and the \nscarcity value of water; and (v) jobs will be created in urban areas by public investment in building \ndownstream infrastructure.  \n \n35.  Governance.  MOHUA  follows  national  laws  on  public  financial  management,  while \nsubnational governments follow the respective public financial management regulations. Central \nand state governments practice a well-organized and systematic approach to budget formulation, \nlinked to fiscal targets under the respective fiscal responsibility legislation, to ensure prudence in \nfiscal management and fiscal stability. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India \n(the supreme audit institution of India) carries out regular statutory external audits. ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 (footnote 22) flagged two issues: (i) low capacity in \nexecuting  agencies  to  handle  multidisciplinary  tasks  on  interdepartmental  coordination  and \ngovernance; and (ii) weaknesses in the urban governance institutional framework. While MOHUA \nhas experience in implementing various national programs, the attached TA will enhance the \ncapacity of MOHUA and state agencies (including ULBs) to mitigate the risk further. The program \nwill strengthen ULB capacity to deliver basic services through better planning and an enhanced \nrevenue base. Moreover, an online M&E platform to be established by MOHUA under the program \nwill improve reform monitoring and increased transparency. As ADB financing will be provided as \nbudget support to the Ministry of Finance, no significant risk is associated with fund flow. \n \n36.  Safeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \nclassified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. The policy actions supported by the program are not expected to have adverse \nimpacts on the environment or indigenous peoples or require involuntary resettlement. The \nsafeguard  assessment  matrix  indicates  the  potential  impacts  of  each  policy  action  under \nsubprogram 1, together with the corresponding mitigation measures.50 The safeguards matrix \nfocuses on subprogram 1, but during the processing of subprogram 2, ADB will discuss with the \ngovernment the potential indirect environment and social impacts of the policies once they are \nimplemented by the states and ULBs. TA will support an institutional review and capacity \nassessment for safeguards under subprogram 2, and provide recommendations to address any \nconstraints or suggest any improvements. \n \n37.  Mainstreaming  climate  change.  A  climate  risk  and  adaptation  assessment  was \nundertaken during program preparation, and identified how basic urban services are sensitive to \na changing climate. An increase in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns will affect \nthe performance of service delivery under reform area 1. Urban water supply is very sensitive to \nchanges in rainfall and requires adaptation measures on both the supply side, such as through \nimproved  water  resources  management,  and  through  demand-side  management.  Extreme \nweather and higher temperatures can affect the performance of wastewater treatment plants. \nUrban water bodies, while very sensitive to climate impacts, are critical for building resilience \nthrough improved groundwater recharge and for reducing flood risks. Accordingly, relevant policy \nactions proposed for reform areas 1 and 2 promote the integration of climate adaptation and \nresilience considerations based on the local climate risk context.51 The program will contribute to \nclimate  mitigation  by  reducing  water  wastage  and  promoting  energy-efficient  technologies. \nClimate change adaptation is estimated to cost $75.69 million, and climate change mitigation \n$31.99 million. ADB will finance 100% of climate change adaptation and mitigation costs. \n \n \n50  Matrix for Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) \n51 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "14 \n38.  Poverty and social. Following the 2020 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index, India \nhalved its Multidimensional Poverty Index value from FY2006 to FY2016 and achieved the world\u2019s \nlargest reduction in the number of multidimensionally poor people (by 273 million).52 However, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic could affect about 400 million workers in India\u2019s informal sector, pushing \nthem deeper into poverty. Based on the international poverty line of $3.2 per day, the population \nliving below the poverty line reached 44.1% in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic but is \nexpected to fall back to 33.5% in 2022.53 A growing gap between higher- and lower-income states \nremains  a  chronic  concern.  The  program  will  support  equitable  access  to  basic  urban \ninfrastructure,  public  services,  and  opportunities  for  all  through  better  living  conditions,  by \naccelerating and implementing policy actions and urban reforms for improved urban service \ndelivery. Urban poor communities and other socially excluded and vulnerable populations such \nas older people, women, children, and people with disabilities suffer disproportionately from a lack \nof reliable and safe water supply and sanitation services. Insufficient affordable housing forces \nmigrant workers, industrial workers, and the poor, including women, to live in substandard housing, \nor commute long distances. The program will benefit about 81 million current urban poor by \nimproving their living conditions. It is estimated that during pandemic response, there was a \nhomeward exodus of 11.4 million migrant workers, and ARHC is a small but important step toward \nsolving the shelter problem for the migrant population. Program benefits are more prominent \nconsidering the COVID-19 pandemic, as the provision of shelter, clean water, and improved \nsanitation are important to combat health risks, particularly for the poor. \n \n39.  Gender. Subprogram 1 is categorized some gender elements. The program will help \nMOHUA institutionalize GESI commitments in the key urban programs of AMRUT 2.0 and PMAY-\nU  by  mainstreaming  policies  on  women\u2019s  participation  in  water  demand  management  and \ninfrastructure operation. GESI guidelines established under subprogram 1 will be applied across \nall schemes benefiting women and other disadvantaged groups in AMRUT2.0 and ARHC. \nSubprogram  2  will  build  on  subprogram  1  to  pursue  effective  gender  mainstreaming \ncategorization. AMRUT 2.0 guidelines strongly commit to gender equality by supporting women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision-making processes, such as through a citizen feedback mechanism, \nstructures and practices related to water resources management, and self-help groups to support \nasset operations. States and ULBs will implement the guidelines, which will include gender \ntargets,  under  subprogram  2.  Subprogram  2  will  include  preparing  and  implementing  a \nstandardized module to mainstream GESI in urban services delivery; as well as set up an e-\nlearning platform to enable state agencies and ULBs to sustain the inclusion of GESI principles \nin urban service delivery. Under reform area 2, guidelines will be prepared to help ULBs use a \nsex-disaggregated beneficiary database to evaluate compliance with ARHC\u2019s preferential policy \nfor women and disadvantaged groups. This program will improve the quality of urban life, \nespecially for women, the poor, slum dwellers, industrial workers, and migrant workers\u2014by \nmaking access to housing, water supply, and sanitation services gender and socially inclusive. \nThe policy actions will enable states and ULBs to narrow GESI gaps across urban service \nprovision by (i) identifying women and disadvantaged groups as target beneficiaries, (ii) ensuring \ntheir participation in resource and service planning and management, and (iii) obtaining feedback \nfrom them on functional performance so that their unmet needs can be systematically addressed.  \n \n40.
