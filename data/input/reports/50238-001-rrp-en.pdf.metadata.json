NACL  also  lends  directly  to  certain  customer  segments  that  have  traditionally  had \nlimited access to finance. The debt financing of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support \nNACL\u2019s  plan  to  restart  its  funding  and  guarantees,  which  came  to  a  standstill  during  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown, and will target individual micro borrowers; \nmicro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs);  and  home  loan  borrowers.  These \ncustomer  segments  have  been  particularly  impacted  by  COVID-19.  NACL  will  lend  directly  to \nthem and provide support to financiers lending to these segments by catalyzing private debt from \nbanks,  international  financial  institutions,  and  local  capital  markets.  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s \nintervention, NACL will implement measures under a gender action plan (GAP) to expand access \nto credit for women. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\n \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\nA. \n \n3. \nConstrained access to finance for individuals and micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises. About 190 million Indian adults still do not have a bank account despite account \nownership greatly increasing from 35% in 2011 to 80% in 2017.1 Less than 6.6% of borrowers \naccess  credit  through  formal  channels.2 In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017,  India  had  an  estimated  55.8 \nmillion (nonagricultural) MSMEs operating in the top-five industries: retail (46.0%), food products \nand  beverages  (6.0%),  apparel  (5.0%),  motor  vehicle  repair  (4.0%),  and  textiles  (3.0%). 3 \nPredominantly unregistered, 94.9% of MSMEs were micro-, 4.9% small-, and 0.2% medium-sized \nenterprises.4 MSMEs  accounted  for  about  31%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  45%  of \nexports, and employed more than 124 million people. About 59.5% of MSMEs are in rural and \n40.5% in urban areas. The lack of adequate access to finance is a major obstacle to growth of \nMSMEs, with 84% self-financing or using informal finance sources and only 16% accessing credit \nfrom formal financial institutions. For women who own businesses, the issue is more acute, with \nmore than 90% of their finance requirements being met through informal sources. The reasons \ninclude limited awareness and understanding of financial products because of women\u2019s lack of \nfinancial education and unfamiliarity with formal banking institutions, lack of collateral to guarantee \ncredit, and difficulty in presenting their personal profiles and track records. Women also require \nsupport from male family members for loan applications and are subjected to other discriminatory \n\n \n\n1  Global Findex Database. 2017.

Financing India\u2019s MSMEs: Estimation of Debt Requirement of MSMEs in \n\nIndia. Washington, DC. \n\n4  Only 15% of MSMEs are registered as enterprises with district industry centers or the online Udyog Aadhaar system. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npractices by loan officers.5 Access to long-term, larger loans, such as mortgages, are particularly \nproblematic.6 \n \n4. \nNonbank financial companies at the forefront of financial inclusion. As of the end of \nMarch 2020, 9,601 NBFCs were registered7 but only 278 were considered systemically important \nby the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).8 State-owned banks, which have traditionally \ndominated the  banking  landscape, continue to focus  on  direct  agriculture  loans and collateral-\nbacked loans to MSMEs, allowing NBFCs to flourish, with their share of total credit rising sharply \nfrom  18%  in  FY2015  to  23%  in  FY2019.  NBFCs  have  created  a  business  niche  in  inclusive \nsectors,  targeting  lower-income  segments,  where  banks  have  limited  or  negligible  presence. \nNBFCs often rely on alternative credit lending models, such as assessing cash flows for informal \nbusinesses  or  relying  on  the  social  contract  that  exists  in  close-knit  communities  rather  than \ntraditional  collateral-backed  lending  models.  NBFCs  have  reached  underserved  and  unserved \ncustomers by establishing superior low-cost distribution models. Banks have also started relying \non NBFCs to support lower-income segments, lending to which qualifies as priority sector lending \n(PSL),9 by  (i)  purchasing  portfolios  originated  by  NBFCs  through  the  securitization  and  direct \nassignment  route,10 (ii)  partnering  with  them  through  the  business  correspondent  route,11 and \n(iii) entering into co-lending arrangements.12 The success of the NBFC business model can be \ngauged from the conversion, in 2016, of nine NBFCs into small finance banks (SFBs), a special \nbank category created by RBI to assist the underserved and unserved segments. Housing finance \ncompanies  (HFCs)  primarily  target  special  customer  segments  (often  outside  urban  areas), \nincluding  affordable  housing  buyers  and  the  self-employed,  whom  commercial  banks  do  not \nserve. As of March 2020, HFCs accounted for 34% of the total mortgage loan market.13 \n \nConstraints  in  raising  debt.  Access  to  medium-  and  long-term  finance  is  highly \n5. \nconstrained  for  NBFCs,  especially  small  and  medium-sized  ones.  Typically,  the  only  formal \nsources of funding available to such NBFCs are domestic bank loans and, selectively, finance \nfrom multilateral development banks and development finance institutions for the larger, higher-\nrated NBFCs. Even then, the quantum of funding is often restricted because of the limited track \nrecord,  small  size,  and  lower  credit  ratings  of  many  NBFCs.

An estimated 90% of the shortage is in the affordable housing segment, primarily for \nthe economically weaker section and the low-income group. ICRA Research. 2020. Indian Mortgage Finance Market. \nAugust 2020. Delhi; Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation. 2017. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. Delhi. \nAccording to the ministry, those in the economically weaker section have a family income of less than \u20b90.3 million \nper  annum;  in  the  low-income  group,  \u20b90.3  million\u2013\u20b90.6  million;  and  in  the  middle-income  group,  more  than  \u20b90.6 \nmillion and less than \u20b91.8 million. \n\n7  In this document, NBFCs include MFIs and housing finance companies (HFCs) unless specified. \n8  Those with total assets of more than \u20b95 billion. \n9  PSL is a requirement of RBI to support financial inclusion. As per current guidelines, commercial banks must lend at \nleast  40%  of  their  adjusted  net  bank  credit  of  the  previous  year  to  specified  priority  sectors  such  as  agriculture, \nMSMEs, and export-oriented industries, focusing on rural borrowers. If a bank fails to achieve the PSL target, any \nshortfall needs to be deployed in funds, such as the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund run by the National Bank \nfor Agriculture and Rural Development, where the rates of interest are low and determined based on the extent of \nthe bank\u2019s PSL shortfall. RBI. Frequently Asked Questions.  \n\n10 Securitization allows a lender to pool certain assets and sell them to different investors.  Please refer to a sample \nsecuritization  structure  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  As  per  estimates  by  ICRA \nResearch, a credit rating agency in India, the total volume of securitization and direct assignment  increased to an \nestimated \u20b92.0 trillion in FY2020, nearly triple the \u20b9692.0 billion in FY2016. \n\n11 Business correspondents are essentially  bank agents that extend services, such as opening accounts, mobilizing \n\ndeposits, accepting remittances, making remittance payouts, and originating loans on behalf of the bank. \n\n12 Customer origination, collection, and servicing are done by the NBFC while typically retaining 20% of a loan on its \n\nbalance sheet, with the balance booked by the partner bank. Co-lending is expected to increase. \n\n13 ICRA Research. 2020. Indian Mortgage Finance Market. August 2020. Delhi. \n\n\ftraditionally catered to government entities and large top-rated corporates and thus have limited \ndepth.  As  a  result,  most  small  and  medium-sized  NBFCs  do  not  access  the  bond  markets, \nespecially for medium- and long-term paper. NBFCs that focus on financially inclusive sectors are \noften small, which limits their access to medium- and long-term bank funding and to debt capital \nmarkets. \n \n6. \nAccess  to  debt  funding  has  been  further  constrained  since  the  collapse,  in  September \n2018, of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS),14 a large and well-known \nNBFC, as well as certain other NBFCs. The mutual fund industry\u2019s exposure to NBFCs decreased \nsharply  by  48%  from  July  2018  to  July  2020.15 Banks  bridged  part  of  the  gap,  with  lending  to \nNBFCs as a percentage of total bank credit rising from  7.0% in October 2018 to 9.0% in June \n2020.16 The  same  was  not  adequate,  however,  to  prevent  a  slowdown  in  credit  growth  in  the \nNBFC  sector,  which  saw  its  annual  growth  of  17.7%  in  FY2014\u2013FY2018  fall  to  an  estimated \n11.3% in FY2018\u2013FY2020. By comparison, bank credit growth was 6.7% in FY2014\u2013FY2018 and \n12.0% in FY2018\u2013FY2020. \n \nCOVID-19 impact. The Government of India responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by \n7. \nimposing  one  of  the  most  stringent  lockdowns,  starting  24  March  2020,  before  easing  some \nrestrictions in May 2020 and easing them further in June 2020.17 The lockdowns halted business \noperations and mobility during April and May 2020, which not only impacted businesses but also \nresulted  in  increasing  loss  of  livelihoods,  primarily  in  the  lower-income  segment.  As  a  result, \nIndia\u2019s GDP is expected to contract by 9.0% in FY2021.18 NBFCs and their customers have been \nheavily impacted by COVID-19. Most NBFC clients, who are largely in the informal segment, were \n(and,  in certain locations,  still  are)  affected  by lockdowns.  The  effect  of the  pandemic and the \nresulting  lockdowns  was  evident  in  the  loan  moratoriums  availed  by  customers  to  conserve \nliquidity and tide them over during the shortfall of cash flows. As per NACL estimates, in April and \nMay  2020,  NBFCs  extended  moratoriums  to  ~95%  of  micro  borrowers,  ~70%  of  MSMEs,  and \n~35%  of  affordable  housing  customers.  CRISIL  estimates  revenues  for  MSMEs  to  reduce  by \n17%\u201321% and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to decline \nby  30%\u201340%  in  FY2021.19 A  slow  recovery  cycle  because  of  extended  or  rolling  lockdowns, \ncoupled  with  limited  credit  and  weakening  demand,  worsened  the  credit  profiles  of  these \ncustomers. NBFCs\u2019 ability to extend moratoriums allowed by RBI was compromised because they \ndid  not  get  a  moratorium  from  all  their  lenders  thus  adversely  impacting  the  NBFCs\u2019  liquidity \nposition.20 The flow of fresh credit to the sector, especially to the lower-rated NBFCs, was curtailed \n\n \n\n14 IL&FS, a AAA-rated NBFC, defaulted on its payment obligations, driven by asset\u2013liability mismatches, with short-\nterm  funding  supporting  the  development  of  long-gestation  infrastructure  projects.  The  default  caused  a  crisis  of \nconfidence  among  capital  market  investors,  leading  to  a  liquidity  crunch  for  NBFCs.  Dewan  Housing  Finance \nCorporation, one of the largest HFCs in India, defaulted on its payments in June 2019. It had significant exposure to \nreal  estate companies,  which were  in  the  middle of  a  prolonged slowdown  and heavily  dependent  on  short-term \ncommercial paper, which contributed to liquidity issues. In September 2019, Altico, an NBFC focused on real estate \nfinancing,  defaulted  because of  large-ticket  exposures  to  the  troubled  real  estate  developer  segment  and  asset\u2013\nliability mismatches. \n\n15 Securities Exchange Board of India. 2020.

MSMEs Face Existential Crisis, Revenues to Fall a Fifth. Mumbai (15 June). \n20 RBI allowed banks and NBFCs to extend a moratorium to their clients for 3 months, from March to June 2020. During \nthis  cycle,  NBFCs,  which  are  largely  funded  by  banks  and  mostly  non-deposit  taking,  received  on  average  a \nmoratorium from 50% of their lenders (capital market investors were not covered by RBI\u2019s circular), while extending \nthe moratorium to a larger subset of their customers. RBI later extended the moratorium until the end of August 2020, \nafter which it allowed banks and NBFCs to offer a one-time restructuring of loans for businesses and/or individuals \nafflicted by the pandemic. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndespite some targeted government interventions.21 In its annual financial stability report of July \n2020, RBI expressed concern about the declining share of market funding for NBFCs, especially \nsmaller and medium-sized ones, which had not been supported by banks and the capital markets. \nRBI felt that this situation could accentuate the liquidity risk for the sector and the financial system. \nBecause of the expected slowdown in funding, the NBFC sector is expected to experience a 50%\u2013\n60% decline in disbursements and its first fall in assets under management (AUMs) in nearly 2 \ndecades, with negative growth of 1%\u20133% in FY2021. 22 \n \nLessons. The project draws on the experience of previous ADB loans to NBFCs and MFIs \n8. \nin India, as well as lessons from support to MSMEs during times of crisis.23 These lessons include \nthe following: (i) a timely and relevant response is needed (ADB supported the NBFC and MFI \nsector  after  demonetization  in November  2016  and  the  IL&FS-linked challenges  in September \n2018); (ii) local currency loans should be provided; and (iii) amortizing loans, which align with the \nclient\u2019s  underlying  cash  flows,  are  preferable to  bullet  loan  structures,  to  reduce  asset\u2013liability \nmismatches and refinancing risk for the company. \n \nRationale. Underserved segments\u2019 access to finance, particularly during the pandemic, \n9. \nremains a problem. NACL, with its deep understanding of NBFCs and India\u2019s capital markets and \nstrong  originating  capabilities,  coupled  with  its  sound  risk  culture  and  innovative  product \ndevelopment capabilities, is a suitable candidate for ADB funding. NACL has been a partner in \nADB\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program since 2011.24 NACL is a pioneer \nin the capital markets, facilitating access to mainstream finance for MFIs through innovative risk-\nsharing structures. Initially, NACL facilitated financing to the microfinance segment as a strategy \nfor banks to meet PSL requirements. Over the years, however, NACL has expanded its support \nto other inclusive asset classes by offering MSME, vehicle, agriculture, and affordable housing \nfinancing,  among  others,  primarily  for  smaller  and  lower-rated  NBFCs.  NACL  also  started \nproviding direct loans to MSMEs and individuals for business purposes along with some personal \nloans.  The  direct  loans  are  either  originated  by  NACL  (in  the  case  of  smaller  corporates  and \nmedium-sized enterprises) or through its NBFC partners, where NACL co-finances each exposure \nand  thus  takes  the  underlying  credit  risk  (in  the  case  of  micro  and  small  enterprises  and \nindividuals). More than 90% of total business volumes25 raised by NACL support the livelihood of \ncustomers, i.e., loans are for productive purposes. From its inception to the end of March 2020, \nNACL  has  raised  funding  of  close  to  $12.0  billion  to  the  inclusive  finance  sector.  Given  its \nsuccessful  track  record  in  limiting  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  in  wholesale  lending  portfolios, \nNACL  witnessed  increased  demand  from  other  investors  that  did  not  have  PSL requirements, \nsuch as impact funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign institutional investors. \n\n \n\n21 The Government of India has extended various measures to support  NBFCs, including additional liquidity lines to \nbanks, through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Small Industries Development Bank \nof India; 20% first-loss guarantee for purchasing NBFC paper; guarantee cover to support onlending by banks and \nNBFCs to existing MSME customers, among others. \n\n22 RBI. 2020.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Modalities for the \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program in India. Manila. When the program was approved in December 2010, NACL \nwas not included since the program was focused on risk participation with a local lender. However, in May 2011, the \nprogram was amended to include the guarantee structure, given the compelling partnership potential of NACL.. \n25 Business volume refers to the total amount of debt capital and guarantees raised by NACL for its clients. NACL takes \na portion of this business volume exposure on its balance sheet, which is reflected in its AUMs. AUMs include all on-\nbalance assets and off\u2013balance sheet items with recourse to NACL. NACL earns an arranger fee on the business \nvolumes and earns net interest income on the AUMs.  \n\n\fBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s funding is important to support much-needed access to long-term and stable debt \n10. \nfunding  to  NACL  given  COVID-19\u2019s  impacts  on  the  market  and  NBFCs\u2019  client  base.  NACL \nextended moratoriums to a large portion of its NBFC clients in April and May 2020 to allow them \nto cope with requests for moratoriums from their customers during the complete lockdown. As \nlockdowns started easing in June, moratorium requirements reduced, but still there were demand \nfor moratorium from significant number of clients. The moratoriums ended in August 2020. The \ntransaction will support plans of NACL to restart guarantee operations and disbursements to its \nclients. The support will address a key concern of smaller NBFCs, which is access to fresh credit, \nand allow them to lend to their customers in highly affected segments such as microfinance and \nMSME financing. Given NACL\u2019s business model, the transaction is expected to catalyze domestic \nand foreign capital financing for these inclusive segments. \n \nNACL is well placed to mitigate some of COVID-19\u2019s impacts despite a large share of its \n11. \nportfolio being affected by the pandemic. The company has a strong capital adequacy ratio, which \nis expected to absorb possible increases in credit costs as per stress tests conducted by ADB. \nSimilarly, the company has maintained good liquidity buffers. Fresh debt funding from ADB will \nallow  NACL  to  further  boost  its  liquidity  profile  and  allow  it  to  increase  disbursements  to  and \nguarantees for its clients, helping them recover faster. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nOverview.  NACL  was  established  as  IFMR  Capital  Limited  in  2008  by  Dvara  Trust \n(erstwhile  IFMR  Trust),  a  not-for-profit  foundation  focused  on  financial  inclusion.  NACL  was \nfounded  to  connect  high-quality  NBFCs  with potential  investors for  debt fundraising,  to enable \nthem  to  deepen  their  presence  and  improve  the  access  of  millions  of  financially  excluded \nhouseholds in India to financial services. NACL has become a market-leading debt platform for \nNBFCs with a presence in 680 districts in 29 states and 5 union territories through its 242 partner \noriginators,  serving  more  than  33  million  underlying  borrowers  as  of  FY2020.  NACL  has \ndeveloped its expertise across sectors and a variety of products over the years. NACL acts as an \nintermediary between originators, which cater to financially excluded households and enterprises \nacross the country, and debt capital market investors by providing direct loans and by undertaking \nstructured  transactions  where  NACL  subscribes  to  a  junior  tranche  (higher  risk) 26 or  takes  a \nsecond  loss  position  in  transactions  that  it  originates  for  its  clients.  Such  a  structure  often \nstrengthens the credit rating of the senior tranche, thus attracting mainstream financial investors. \nThe company, in effect, is a wholesale lender and provides debt financing to NBFCs through a \ncombination of its own balance sheet lending, syndications, securitizations, and guarantees. The \nbusiness volumes managed by NACL include all the fund raising it has arranged for its clients, \nwhile  NACL\u2019s  balance  sheet  exposure  forms  part  of  its  assets  under  management.  NACL \nmanages  an  alternate  investment  fund  investing  in  structured  debt  issued  by  financial  service \ncompanies through its 100% subsidiary, Northern Arc Investment Managers.  \n \n13. \nBusiness strategy. NACL plans to continue using its strong risk management capability \nto  retain  its  core  focus  as  a  debt  platform  for  NBFCs.  The  company  also  plans  to  make  its \nexposures  more  granular  by  expanding  its  partnership  model  for  supporting  MSMEs  and \nconsumer lending businesses, while moving into new sectors such as gold loans. The total direct \norigination  portfolio,  through  co-lending  with  partner  financial  institutions,  including  the  MSME \nsegment, is expected to grow faster than the rest of the business and increase its contribution. \nThe company has established strong technology infrastructure to monitor and integrate the direct \nlending portfolio with its partner originators.  \n\n26 The senior tranche has preference in cash flows over a junior tranche, thus improving the credit rating of the structure. \n\nSecuritization Structure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nC. \n \nOwnership. 27  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence  on  NACL,  its  managers  and \n14. \nshareholders,  and  their  fund  managers  and  shareholders. 28  NACL\u2019s  shareholders  are \npredominantly institutional investors, private equity funds, trusts, and a foundation.  \n \n15. \nCorporate governance. NACL\u2019s board of directors is responsible for providing strategic \ndirection,  setting  policies,  supervising  the  company\u2019s  performance,  and  ensuring  NACL\u2019s \ncompliance  with  laws  and  regulations.  NACL  has  a  strong  board  with  eminent  and  reputable \nmembers, each with decades of experience in financial services. In accordance with applicable \nregulatory guidelines, 36% of the board is represented by four independent board members. The \nother seven members include nominee directors of the shareholders and the managing director \nand chief executive officer of the company. The board has various committees, including for audit, \nremuneration, corporate social responsibility, and risk, which govern NACL\u2019s functions. \n \n16.  Management.  Kshama  Fernandes,  a  risk  professional  with  more  than  20  years  of \nexperience in financial services, consulting, and academia, heads a team of 227 people. She was \npreviously the chief risk officer of NACL. She is supported by Nandita Ganapathy, chief financial \nofficer, with more than 20 years of experience; Bama Balakrishnan, chief operating officer, with \nmore  than  20  years  of  experience;  and  Pardhasaradhi  Rallabandi,  chief risk  officer,  with  more \nthan 20 years of experience in organizations such as Standard Chartered and IDBI Bank. \n \n17. \nRisk  management.  NACL  has  a strong risk  culture  as  can  be  seen  from  its  near-zero \ndelinquency track record in its direct wholesale lending portfolio. NACL follows an integrated risk \nmanagement  approach  to  evaluate  the  complete  credit  cycle,  from  onboarding  to  monitoring, \nmaking  extensive  use  of  analytics  and  modeling  to  measure  macro-,  sector-,  and  company-\nspecific trends. Any new segment undergoes 12\u201318 months of evaluation with two or three clients, \nwith  the  board  having  final  responsibility  for  approving  the  onboarding.  The  board\u2019s  risk \nmanagement committee meets every quarter to review the portfolio, sets exposure limits for each \nclient, and is responsible for setting policy. The chief risk officer directly reports to the committee. \nAs a response to various crisis impacting the NBFC sector, NACL adopted stricter changes in its \nexposure limits and governance monitoring of portfolio entities. \n \nD. \n \n\nConfidential Information Deleted  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nto NACL at a tenor of up to 5 years by subscribing to NCDs.29  \n \n\n \n\nADB will provide a senior secured debt financing of up to $50 million (in rupee equivalent) \n\n \n\n27 For details on ownership, board of directors, senior management, and risk management, please refer to Ownership, \n\nManagement, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila; and Integrity Due Diligence Disclosure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n\n29 An NCD is a form of fixed-maturity debt security regulated by RBI and SEBI. Upon issuance, the NCD will be listed \non the Bombay Stock Exchange or National Stock Exchange. If a regulatory change makes it unfeasible to structure \nthe financing as an NCD issuance, ADB may provide a bilateral loan to NACL on substantially the same terms. \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nB. \n \n19. \nUse of proceeds. NACL will use the proceeds of the ADB financing to fund or provide \nguarantees to its NBFC and SFB clients, microfinance borrowers, and MSMEs. A small part of \nADB\u2019s proceeds will be used to provide housing loans to the economically weaker section and \nlow-income group. \n \nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.30 NACL \n20. \nwill  submit  to  ADB  (i)  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  (ii)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, (iii) quarterly loan portfolio and covenant reports, (iv) annual development indicators \nagreed  between  ADB  and  NACL,  (v)  annual  reports  on  safeguards  and  social  protection \ncompliance, and (vi) annual progress reports on the GAP implementation. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nSupporting  livelihoods.  The  transaction  will  support  NACL\u2019s  funding  and  guarantee \nactivities  for  the  inclusive  finance  sector, 31 thus  facilitating  the  flow  of  credit  to  MSMEs  and \nmicrofinance  borrowers  adversely  affected  by  COVID-19  and  allowing  them  to  restart  their \noperations.  Crucially,  the  transaction  will  catalyze  funding  to the  sector  from  private  investors. \nNACL\u2019s typical ratio of business volume to on\u2013balance sheet exposure is five times (i.e., NACL \nenables  a  significantly  higher  amount  of  credit  flow  for  its  clients  for  every  dollar  it  provides \ndirectly). The funding from ADB to NACL is likely to give a positive signal to other lenders and, \nthus, catalyze additional funding for the company. \n \nProviding access to longer tenor funding. By providing long-tenor financing, ADB will \n22. \nhelp NACL support longer-tenor asset classes such as affordable housing and MSME loans. More \nimportantly, ADB will provide a source of stable long-term funding, which is especially difficult to \nraise given market events since September 2018. ADB funding will allow NACL to offer longer-\ntenor financing to its NBFC and SFB clients, which is not readily available through India\u2019s bond \nmarkets, especially after the onset of COVID-19. \n \n23. \nHelping  develop  capital  markets.  The  transaction  will  support  the  issuance  of  debt \ncapital  by small  and medium-sized  NBFCs  by  aiding  the  overall  growth of  NACL\u2019s  operations. \nNACL has diversified the investor base for its inclusive finance clients, which has helped broaden \ncapital markets. ADB\u2019s support will  help NACL continue expanding its innovative products and \nstructures, thereby crowding in private capital for the growth of the inclusive finance space. \n \n24. \nPromoting  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  intervention,  the  gender \nmeasures for NACL include developing and using a gender equality scorecard to evaluate the \ngender equality actions of new institutional clients, the outputs of which may be used for an annual \nworkshop  with  institutional  clients  to  increase  gender  equality.  The  GAP  includes  NACL \nincreasing  the  proportion  of  loans  of  its  MSME  financiers  that  go  to  women  borrowers  or  co-\nborrowers. \n \n\n \n\n30 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 NACL may be required to put up cash collateral, which can be funded from ADB\u2019s proceeds, to provide guarantee \n\nsupport to its clients.  \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n \n\nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.

The potential environmental \nand  social  effects  and  associated  risks  of  the  debt  investment,  and  NACL\u2019s  commitment  and \ncapacity for environmental and social management were assessed. NACL has an environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) policy and a responsible-investment code, which are applied to all \nNACL  investments.  During  due  diligence,  ADB  identified  the  following  actions  to  strengthen \nNACL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements:  (i)  adopt  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list  in  NACL\u2019s  ESG \npolicy; (ii) screen subprojects, and if they are in category A and category B for the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement,  and indigenous peoples, make them  ineligible to  use  ADB  proceeds; \n(iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nabide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy; (iv) take measures to comply with international core labor standards; and (v) \nadopt these changes as a supplementary environmental and social plan of the ESG policy before \ndisbursement of funds.39 NACL will submit periodic reports to ADB to confirm the environmental \nand  social  impacts  of  ADB-funded  NBFCs  and  MSMEs  and  their  compliance  with  local  and \nnational environmental, health and safety, and labor regulations and standards (footnote 41). The \nclimate change impact from the project is expected to be low because of the nature and scale of \nloans that may be financed by the ADB loan proceeds. \n \nEffective gender mainstreaming. In 2016, 90% of women entrepreneurs surveyed had \n31. \nnot availed themselves of finance from formal institutional channels, and an estimated 70% or \n\u20b91.4 trillion of financing demand remained unmet.40 Nearly 3 million MSMEs are fully or partially \nowned by women, and about 78% are in services, which have been particularly hard hit by the \nCOVID-19 crisis.41 NACL is a pioneer in enabling finance to NBFCs that lend predominantly to \nwomen.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  NACL  will  commit  to \nincorporate  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  business \nactivities. Confidential information deleted. NACL will submit periodic reports on implementation \nof gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \nNACL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \n32. \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
