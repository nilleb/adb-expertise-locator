THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Xinjiang  Changji  Integrated  Urban\u2013Rural \nInfrastructure Demonstration Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  significantly  strengthen  the  business  environment  of  Changji  Hui \nAutonomous  Prefecture  (Changji)  along  the  Urumqi\u2013Changji  economic  corridor  through \ncoordinated  and  integrated  multisector  development,  and  a  people-centered  approach  to \nurbanization.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) is located on the northwestern frontier of \nthe PRC. It shares borders with eight countries and lies on the ancient Silk Road. Xinjiang\u2019s rapid \nrate of economic growth (9.8%) and urbanization since the early 1990s has improved the overall \neconomic well-being of its residents.2 Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, serves as a regional \ntransportation and logistics hub between the PRC and Central Asia. The value of Xinjiang\u2019s \ninternational trade increased during 2001\u20132013 at an average annual rate of 25.7%.3 However, \nXinjiang remains one of the PRC\u2019s least developed regions, and as such has been a beneficiary \nof the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region.4 The region also suffers from \npoor industrial performance and low educational attainment among workers.5  \n \n4.  Changji covers an area of 73,140 square kilometers, and is situated on a narrow piedmont \nplain between the Tianshan mountain ranges in the south and the Gurbantunggut Desert in the \nnorth;  the  corridor  (40\u201380  kilometers  [km]  in  width)  contains  settlements,  agriculture,  and \nindustries. Changji surrounds Urumqi; Changji City (seat of the prefecture) is located 30 km from \nUrumqi. Changji is located at the center of the Northern Tianshan economic zone, the Urumqi\u2013\nChangji\u2013Shihezi city cluster, and the Urumqi\u2013Changji economic corridor. This location gives \nChangji an important role, and some key service activities provided by Urumqi have been \nrelocated to Changji. It is urbanizing rapidly reflecting the PRC\u2019s strategy to accelerate the \ndevelopment of the western regions and its policy to promote regional economic cooperation with \nneighboring countries, but the Prefecture\u2019s economic development is constrained by significant \ndeficiencies in urban infrastructure and environmental management, including (i) inadequate \nconnectivity of Changji\u2019s cities and towns to the major corridor, (ii) poor service-level solid waste \nmanagement, (iii) rapid depletion of groundwater supplies, (iv) soil erosion caused by geologic \nand severe climatic conditions, and (v) weak urban management capacity. Changji\u2019s favorable \nlocation and its potential for economic growth encourages companies and industries to locate \nthere, and has resulted in increased pressure on the environment and the inadequate, poorly \nperforming urban infrastructure.  \n                                                                                       \n1  Changji comprises  Changji City,  Fukang  City,  Hutubi  County, Jimsar  County,  Manas  County,  Mori  Kazakh \nAutonomous County, and Qitai County. \n2   The PRC government is pursuing urbanization to enable more efficient provision of public and social services. \n3   Xinjiang Statistical Bureau. Various years. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Statistical Yearbook. Urumqi. \n4  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2000. The National Strategy for Development of the Western Region. Beijing. \nThe PRC\u2019s western region has six provinces, five autonomous regions (including Xinjiang), and one municipality. \n5  A 2014 labor market survey of Xinjiang indicated 71.8% of enterprises experienced difficulties finding appropriately \nskilled  workers;  69.0%  experienced  difficulties  in  recruitment,  including  30.1%  with  difficulties  in  recruiting \ntechnicians.  G. Wang, et al. 2014. Research on Workforce Demand and Supply in Enterprises. Xinjiang.  \n ", "2 \n5.  Fukang City and Hutubi and Qitai counties of Changji, located in the Urumqi\u2013Changji \neconomic corridor, have experienced significant economic growth during 1994\u20132014, driven \nmainly by growth in urban-based secondary and tertiary sectors, and rural-based primary sector.6 \nConsequently, an appropriate urbanization process\u2014involving both physical and social aspects \nof urbanization\u2014is needed to accommodate the rural\u2013urban shift of economic activities. An \nindustrial demand analysis conducted during project preparation projected significant demand for \nemployees and industrial land in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai. However, the current business \nenvironment and urban infrastructure facilities in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai are relatively weak. \nMany people living in the urban center, peripheries, and villages within the urban area\u2014a large \nnumber  of  whom  are  rural  migrants\u2014still  lack  access  to  safe  and  reliable  basic  urban \ninfrastructure services. Establishment of a sound economic base and livable environment requires \nthat Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai respond to economic and social development challenges, and take \nadvantage of the economic growth opportunities available to cities and towns in the Urumqi\u2013\nChangji economic corridor. \n \n6.  Value added by Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank \nprovided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  involving  rigorous  policy  dialogue  and \nengagement, and supported adoption by the government of a strategic, holistic, and integrated \nmultisector people-centered urban development approach as compared to construction-focused \napproach in Changji.7 This aligns with the PRC\u2019s National New-type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u2013\n2020 (NNUP),8 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.9 In addition to \nengineering solutions to address basic infrastructure needs and environmental issues, Changji \nrecognized the importance of adding nonstructural components (as part of outputs 2, 4, and 5) to \nthe project to address issues including the needs to (i) strengthen urban planning capacity, \nintroduce people-centered approaches to urban planning and development consistent with the \nPRC Government\u2019s urbanization direction, and apply people-centered approaches during master \nplan updates that may be undertaken during project implementation; (ii) address the needs of \nworkers and employers by enhancing the quality of technical and vocational education and \ntraining; and (iii) improve solid waste management and raise environmental awareness by piloting \nwaste reduction, reuse, and recycling in Xinjiang. The original project scope mainly focusing on \nroads and pipes was completely transformed by ADB intervention into strategic multisector, \npeople-centered  urbanization,  and  sustainable  approach.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment (CRVA) was conducted confirming the project\u2019s medium climate risk categorization. \nA list of design and engineering strategies that address the vulnerabilities identified in the CRVA \nhas been incorporated into the design of project components.  \n \n7.  Development prospects in the project areas are attracting rural migrants to industrial \ncenters in search of employment opportunities. In line with the NNUP, the project aims to \ndemonstrate a modern, innovative approach to urban\u2013rural development that creates integrated, \nlivable, green, and economically sustainable communities.10 In addition to physical infrastructure, \n                                                                                       \n6  Average annual gross domestic product growth rates in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai in 2004\u20132014 were 8.6%\u20139.1% in \nthe primary sector, 13.7%\u201330.3% in the secondary sector, and 13.4%\u201315.3% in the tertiary sector. \n7  Initially, the government proposal included 67 new road segments of 137 km, which justification was identified to be \ninadequate to contribute to sustainable or resilient development, as they are widely dispersed, unconnected, and \nsimply fill gaps in the master plans to expand the urban areas in the three city and counties. The proposal was \nreduced to 22 segments of 36.4 km, including both new and rehabilitated roads, that are assessed to be justifiable \nfor ADB investment. Furthermore, ADB organized a New-type Urbanization workshop to engage with stakeholders \nto share information on how Changji\u2019s project proposal for ADB investment aligns with the sustainable urban \ndevelopment agenda of the PRC. This participatory workshop was in itself an innovation for Changji. \n8  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2014. National New-type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. Beijing. \n9  ADB. 2016. Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian Development Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n10 The strategy of the PRC government is to efficiently integrate services in urban areas by linking nearby rural areas \nthrough better road networks and extending service availability to nearby rural residents. \n ", "3 \nthe project\u2019s integrated social infrastructure components seek to facilitate the transition of rural \nmigrants to the urban environment by providing them with skills to take advantage of employment \nand income opportunities in emerging communities around the industrial zones. High economic \ngrowth  together  with  improved  business  and  living  environments  resulting  from  project \ninvestments could attract additional private sector investments, with spillover effects on small \ncities and county towns along the strategic economic corridor, including Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai. \nThe experience in Changji could serve as a demonstration project for other small cities and towns \nin Xinjiang and the PRC. \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The proposed project closely aligns with the (i) the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, which aims to balance the development of rural and urban areas to facilitate inclusive \nurbanization and industrial transformation; (ii) the NNUP (footnote 8), which promotes people-\ncentered urbanization and development of small and medium-sized cities and towns; (iii) the ADB \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 9), with strategic priorities that \ninclude (a) integrated, green, inclusive, and competitive urban development, focusing on small \nand medium-sized cities in less-developed regions; (b) regional cooperation and integration; and \n(c) managing climate change and the environment; and (iv) the ADB Urban Operational Plan, \n2012\u20132020, which supports green, competitive, and inclusive development.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  Changji\u2019s  cities  and  counties\u2019 \nurbanization and business environment enhanced, 12 and (ii) people\u2019s living conditions in small \ncities and towns improved (footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: services \nprovided by urban\u2013rural infrastructure and environmental features improved.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  Output 1: Roads and road ancillary facilities (including utility pipes) constructed or \nrehabilitated. The project will (i) construct five roads of 7.2 km and rehabilitate four roads of               \n6.4 km with ancillary facilities, including utility pipes (water, wastewater, and heating), and the \npurchase of road maintenance equipment for the Fukang urban area; (ii) construct five roads of \n3.4 km with ancillary facilities, including utility pipes (water, wastewater, and heating), and the \npurchase of road maintenance equipment for Ganhezi Town of Fukang; (iii) construct three roads \nof 8.0 km with ancillary facilities, including utility pipes (water, wastewater, heating, and gas) in \nHutubi; and (iv) construct five roads of 11.4 km with ancillary facilities, including water pipes in \nQitai. Road ancillary facilities include underground utility pipes; green space with irrigation \nsystems; ditches, culverts and drainage systems; and road safety facilities, such as light-emitting \ndiode street lighting, signals, and signage. The roads will improve connectivity and facilitate \ntransfer of goods, while pipe installations will cover previously unserved areas and fill gaps in \nexisting utility networks. \n \n11.  Output 2: Water supply and solid waste management facilities in Qitai improved. In \nQitai, the project will (i) build water transmission pipelines of about 68 km; (ii) construct a domestic \nsolid waste sanitary landfill with capacity of 1.81 million cubic meters; (iii) close an existing \ndomestic solid waste landfill with capacity of 787,000 cubic meters to avoid adverse effects on \n                                                                                       \n11  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project is technically feasible as a result of examination of the project\u2019s compatibility \nwith the PRC\u2019s engineering guidelines and standards, local regulations, topography and climate, \nand  strategic  and  sector  priorities.  Design  options  and  alternatives  were  compared  before \nselecting the best possible technologies in terms of cost and environmental and social impacts. \nLandfill site selection and closure of existing landfill will minimize impact on the environment and \nurban area. Pavement structure and pipe foundation design considered local topography and \nclimate. Baseline information collected was applied to the design. Capacity building was based \non a needs assessment for successful implementation and operation of project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis. Economic analyses for all components were prepared in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines.16 Access roads were justified by comparing project journey time savings \n                                                                                       \n16 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nwith do-minimum access arrangements. In a few cases, there were also diversion benefits. For \nroads upgrades, net benefits arise from road-user cost savings. The water supply component will \naugment supplies from sustainable resources to the Qitai urban area, where aquifer depletion is \nincreasingly  limiting  water  availability.  Net  benefits  were  assessed  following  a  survey  of \nwillingness-to-pay for improved supplies. Similarly, Qitai\u2019s landfill capacity is expected to be \nexhausted by the end of 2018, so the project will add landfill capacity (net benefits were assessed \nusing the results of the survey). The technical and vocational education and training component \nwill contribute to increasing worker educational and skill levels and is justified using expected \nwage increases. The benefits of ecological protection shelterbelts arise from soil and water \nconservation and carbon sequestration. The present value of benefits of all components is \nCNY1,321 million and that of costs is CNY1,235 million, giving an overall economic internal rate \nof return estimated at 12.8%. \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The project has no revenue-generating components. The financial \nanalysis, therefore, focuses on the ability of the end borrowers\u2014Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai \ngovernments\u2014to service project debts and provide counterpart funds. ADB loan funds will be \nchanneled to the project through Xinjiang Finance Department to the Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai \ngovernments. In addition, the Xinjiang government provided assurances (as noted in the legal \ncovenants) on the availability of counterpart funds, and funds for project recurrent expenses. A \nfinancial sustainability analysis was undertaken based on the fiscal impact of the project on the \nfinances of Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai; it shows that their commitment to the project during \nimplementation (October 2017\u2013March 2023), as a percentage of revenue, will be (i) for Fukang, \nfrom 3.40% in 2019 to 0.22% in 2022; (ii) for Hutubi, from 2.35% in 2020 to 0.15% in 2022; and \n(iii) for Qitai, from 6.45% in 2019 to 0.34% in 2022. The commitment will rise in 2023 (to an \nestimated 1.17% for Fukang, 0.63% for Hutubi, and 1.27% for Qitai) with commencement of debt \nrepayment,  but  will  decline  beginning  in  2024.  The  Xinjiang  and  PRC  governments  have \naddressed past revenue shortfalls through budget transfers. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  A financial management assessment found that primary financial risks are the (i) financial \nposition of Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai to independently provide funding for (a) counterpart funds \nduring implementation, (b) debt service payments, and (c) funding for operation and maintenance \nafter project completion; and (ii) lack of familiarity on the part of PMO staff with ADB accounting \nand disbursement policy and procedures. The participation of the Xinjiang government through \nthe  Xinjiang  Finance  Department  results  in  a  moderate  overall  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk, with a moderate to substantial risk for the implementing agencies. These risks \nare mitigated through a time-bound action plan for financial and procurement matters, which was \nagreed upon with the PMOs. Given these measures and domestic supervision, the procurement \nand financial management arrangements are adequate. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures regarding procurement and financial management are described in the \nPAM. \n \n25.  A procurement risk assessment found that the primary procurement risk is the lack of \nknowledge regarding procurement requirements and procedures for ADB-funded projects on the \npart  of  project  implementation  units.  Xinjiang  PMO  will  provide  overall  management  and \nsupervision  based  on  its  extensive  ADB  project  experience,  which  mitigates this risk to  a \nmoderate level. With additional support from the tendering agency and project implementation \nconsultants during project implementation, and considering that most of the contract packages \nare common and similar to those procured previously in other ADB projects in Xinjiang managed \nby its PMO, the procurement arrangement is concluded adequate. \n ", "8 \n \n26.  The  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the executing agency. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  In 2015, the project area had a population of 573,819, with 184,242 households; the poor \npopulation of Changji numbered 26,218, including 15,863 within the project city and counties.17 \nThe project has a direct beneficiary population of 304,159 in the three project city and counties, \nwith 134,675 (44.3%) in urban areas, and 169,484 (55.7%) in rural areas. The project\u2019s indirect \nbeneficiary population is 269,660, including 131,055 (48.6%) urban residents, and 138,605 \n(51.4%) rural residents. The project will generate 202 skilled and 910 unskilled jobs during \nconstruction  and  64  skilled  and  95  unskilled  jobs  during  operations.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies provided assurance that priority for employment will be given to vulnerable \ngroups such as women, the poor, and ethnic minorities. A social and gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure that the positive benefits of the project accrue to the beneficiaries. \n \n28.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The \nproject will have significant benefits for women because they are primarily responsible for water \ncollection, solid waste disposal, and related household activities. The social and gender action \nplan will help ensure (i) up to 50% of participants in consultation meetings are women; (ii) women \nare employed for at least 25% of jobs during construction and 30% during operations; (iii) up to \n50%  of  participants  in  gender-sensitive  trainings  on  public  road  safety,  prevention  of \ncommunicable diseases, drugs and human trafficking, environmental awareness, and education \nprograms on sanitation are women; (iv) up to 60% of participants in technical and vocational \neducation and training short-term courses are women; and (v) appropriate gender targets, \nindicators, and sex-disaggregated data are used for project monitoring and evaluation. A social \ndevelopment  specialist  with  gender  expertise  under  output  5  will  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of the social and gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \nclassification is category B for the environment and indigenous peoples, and category A for \ninvoluntary resettlement.18 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website in April \n2017. The IEE incorporated findings of the domestic feasibility studies and environmental impact \nassessments,  CRVA,  and  technical  assessments.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  and  risks  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through  effective \nimplementation of the EMP. Construction dust, noise, soil erosion, and local disruption to traffic \nand communities will be temporary and localized. During operation, special attention will be given \nto sustainable use of irrigation water, operational control of the proposed new sanitary landfill, \nand  proper  closure  and  rehabilitation  of the  current  Qitai  landfill  site. The  EMP  defined  a \nmonitoring  plan  to  verify  the  project\u2019s  environmental  performance.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies are committed to managing the identified environmental risks. The CRVA \n                                                                                       \n17 PRC, Xinjiang, and Changji (Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai). 2015.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n ", "9 \nconcluded that the project area is characterized by (i) low rainfall, which will increase by between \n2% and 3% by 2040 with high yearly variability; and (ii) very low average temperatures, which will \nincrease by between 10% and 20%. It recommended adaptation measures for the design of \nbridges,  culverts,  landfill  leachate  treatment,  and  shelterbelts  to  address  these  impacts. \nReductions in greenhouse gas emissions through design and management of roads, irrigation, \nsolid waste recycling plus the carbon sequestration of the project\u2019s forests have been estimated \nat 68,934 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030. Environmental management is \nsupported by a comprehensive set of loan covenants and capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening activities under the project. Environment safeguards documents were disclosed to \nthe affected people. Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance \nwith the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Three resettlement plans were agreed to by ADB \nand the government and will be updated during project implementation. The key information in \nthe resettlement plans was disclosed to the affected people and uploaded on the ADB website in \nMarch 2017. The project will permanently acquire an estimated 10,193 mu of land, consisting \nprimarily (9,575.44 mu) of collective cultivated land, with the remainder residential, woodland, \ngrassland, and construction land.19 Of the estimated 590 affected households (2,529 persons), \nabout 304 households (1,557 persons) belong to ethnic minority groups (Kazak, Hui, and Uygur), \naccounting for 62% of the total affected population. About 199 households (724 persons) will be \nrequired to relocate; 58 of these households (254 persons) belong to ethnic minority groups, while \n20 households have residential shops. In addition, there were 21 house renters identified. The \nproject will affect the structures of one enterprise with six workers. During resettlement planning, \nthe affected households, villages and communities, village or community leaders, and town and \ntownship and county or city governments actively participated in the meaningful consultations, \nrisk assessment, and disclosure activities. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, \ninternal and external monitoring will be carried out, and the required resettlement staff in each \nPMO has been identified and will be provided with the necessary training on resettlement \nimplementation. The resettlement budget will be made available on a timely basis. All monitoring \nreports will be disclosed and uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category B). In 2015, Changji had an ethnic minority population of \nabout 437,800 accounting for 27.4% of the total residents, including Hui (8.8%), Kazakh (10.7%), \nand Uygur (5.8%). Within the direct project areas, ethnic minorities comprise over 27% of the \npopulation.  Although  the  urban  communities  are  ethnically  mixed,  some  differences\u2014e.g., \nrelating to culture, religion, and language\u2014are maintained. Ethnic minorities will not be adversely \naffected,  except for  1,557  persons  who  belong  to  ethnic minority groups  affected  by  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. All households in the urban areas will benefit from the new \nand upgraded infrastructure services. An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been \nprepared and endorsed by the PMOs. The EMDP focuses on measures to facilitate the inclusion \nof ethnic minorities in all project activities, and to ensure that their customs and beliefs are \nrespected throughout project implementation. The EMDP was disclosed to ethnic minorities in the \nareas targeted by the project in their respective local languages, and uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite in April 2017. EMDP implementation and monitoring is supported under output 5. \nMonitoring and reporting arrangements for the ethnic minority safeguard are included in the PAM \nand the project arrangement. \n \n \n \n                                                                                       \n19 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "10 \nF.
