It shares borders with eight countries and lies on the ancient Silk Road. Xinjiang\u2019s rapid \nrate of economic growth (9.8%) and urbanization since the early 1990s has improved the overall \neconomic  well-being  of  its residents.2 Urumqi,  the  capital  city  of Xinjiang, serves  as  a  regional \ntransportation  and  logistics  hub  between  the  PRC  and  Central  Asia.  The  value  of  Xinjiang\u2019s \ninternational trade increased during 2001\u20132013 at an average annual rate of 25.7%.3 However, \nXinjiang remains one of the PRC\u2019s least developed regions, and as such has been a beneficiary \nof the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region.4 The region also suffers from \npoor industrial performance and low educational attainment among workers.5  \n \nChangji covers an area of 73,140 square kilometers, and is situated on a narrow piedmont \n4. \nplain between the Tianshan mountain ranges in the south and the Gurbantunggut Desert in the \nnorth;  the  corridor  (40\u201380  kilometers  [km]  in  width)  contains  settlements,  agriculture,  and \nindustries. Changji surrounds Urumqi; Changji City (seat of the prefecture) is located 30 km from \nUrumqi. Changji is located at the center of the Northern Tianshan economic zone, the Urumqi\u2013\nChangji\u2013Shihezi  city  cluster,  and  the  Urumqi\u2013Changji  economic  corridor.  This  location  gives \nChangji  an  important  role,  and  some  key  service  activities  provided  by  Urumqi  have  been \nrelocated  to  Changji.  It  is  urbanizing  rapidly  reflecting  the  PRC\u2019s  strategy  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of the western regions and its policy to promote regional economic cooperation with \nneighboring countries, but the Prefecture\u2019s economic development is constrained by significant \ndeficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  environmental  management,  including  (i)  inadequate \nconnectivity of Changji\u2019s cities and towns to the major corridor, (ii) poor service-level solid waste \nmanagement, (iii) rapid depletion of groundwater supplies, (iv) soil erosion caused by geologic \nand severe climatic conditions, and (v) weak urban management capacity. Changji\u2019s favorable \nlocation  and  its  potential  for  economic  growth  encourages  companies  and  industries  to  locate \nthere,  and  has  resulted  in  increased  pressure  on  the  environment  and  the  inadequate,  poorly \nperforming urban infrastructure.  \n\n                                                                                         \n1  Changji  comprises  Changji  City,  Fukang  City,  Hutubi  County,  Jimsar  County,  Manas  County,  Mori  Kazakh \n\nAutonomous County, and Qitai County. \n\n2   The PRC government is pursuing urbanization to enable more efficient provision of public and social services. \n3   Xinjiang Statistical Bureau.

Beijing. \nThe PRC\u2019s western region has six provinces, five autonomous regions (including Xinjiang), and one municipality. \n5  A 2014 labor market survey of Xinjiang indicated 71.8% of enterprises experienced difficulties finding appropriately \nskilled  workers;  69.0%  experienced  difficulties  in  recruitment,  including  30.1%  with  difficulties  in  recruiting \ntechnicians.  G. Wang, et al. 2014. Research on Workforce Demand and Supply in Enterprises. Xinjiang.  \n\n \n\n\fFukang  City  and  Hutubi  and  Qitai  counties  of  Changji,  located  in  the  Urumqi\u2013Changji \n5. \neconomic  corridor,  have  experienced  significant  economic  growth  during  1994\u20132014,  driven \nmainly by growth in urban-based secondary and tertiary sectors, and rural-based primary sector.6 \nConsequently, an appropriate urbanization process\u2014involving both physical and social aspects \nof  urbanization\u2014is  needed  to  accommodate  the  rural\u2013urban  shift  of  economic  activities.  An \nindustrial demand analysis conducted during project preparation projected significant demand for \nemployees  and  industrial  land  in  Fukang,  Hutubi,  and  Qitai.  However,  the  current  business \nenvironment and urban infrastructure facilities in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai are relatively weak. \nMany people living in the urban center, peripheries, and villages within the urban area\u2014a large \nnumber  of  whom  are  rural  migrants\u2014still  lack  access  to  safe  and  reliable  basic  urban \ninfrastructure services. Establishment of a sound economic base and livable environment requires \nthat Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai respond to economic and social development challenges, and take \nadvantage  of  the  economic  growth  opportunities  available  to  cities  and  towns  in  the  Urumqi\u2013\nChangji economic corridor. \n \n6. \nValue added by Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank \nprovided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  involving  rigorous  policy  dialogue  and \nengagement, and supported adoption by the government of a strategic, holistic, and integrated \nmultisector people-centered urban development approach as compared to construction-focused \napproach  in  Changji.7 This  aligns  with  the  PRC\u2019s  National  New-type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u2013\n2020 (NNUP),8 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.9 In addition to \nengineering solutions to address basic infrastructure needs and environmental issues, Changji \nrecognized the importance of adding nonstructural components (as part of outputs 2, 4, and 5) to \nthe  project  to  address  issues  including  the  needs  to  (i)  strengthen  urban  planning  capacity, \nintroduce  people-centered  approaches to  urban planning  and  development  consistent  with  the \nPRC Government\u2019s urbanization direction, and apply people-centered approaches during master \nplan  updates  that  may  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation;  (ii)  address  the  needs  of \nworkers  and  employers  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and \ntraining; and (iii) improve solid waste management and raise environmental awareness by piloting \nwaste reduction, reuse, and recycling in Xinjiang. The original project scope mainly focusing on \nroads  and  pipes  was  completely  transformed  by  ADB  intervention  into  strategic  multisector, \npeople-centered  urbanization,  and  sustainable  approach.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment (CRVA) was conducted confirming the project\u2019s medium climate risk categorization. \nA list of design and engineering strategies that address the vulnerabilities identified in the CRVA \nhas been incorporated into the design of project components.  \n \nDevelopment  prospects  in  the  project  areas  are  attracting  rural  migrants  to  industrial \n7. \ncenters  in  search  of  employment  opportunities.  In  line  with  the  NNUP,  the  project  aims  to \ndemonstrate a modern, innovative approach to urban\u2013rural development that creates integrated, \nlivable, green, and economically sustainable communities.10 In addition to physical infrastructure, \n                                                                                         \n6  Average annual gross domestic product growth rates in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai in 2004\u20132014 were 8.6%\u20139.1% in \n\nthe primary sector, 13.7%\u201330.3% in the secondary sector, and 13.4%\u201315.3% in the tertiary sector. \n\n7  Initially, the government proposal included 67 new road segments of 137 km, which justification was identified to be \ninadequate to contribute to sustainable or resilient development, as they are widely dispersed, unconnected, and \nsimply  fill  gaps  in  the  master  plans  to  expand  the  urban  areas  in  the  three  city  and  counties.  The  proposal  was \nreduced to 22 segments of 36.4 km, including both new and rehabilitated roads, that are assessed to be justifiable \nfor ADB investment. Furthermore, ADB organized a New-type Urbanization workshop to engage with stakeholders \nto  share  information  on  how  Changji\u2019s  project  proposal  for  ADB  investment  aligns  with  the  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment agenda of the PRC. This participatory workshop was in itself an innovation for Changji. \n8  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2014. National New-type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. Beijing. \n9  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n10 The strategy of the PRC government is to efficiently integrate services in urban areas by linking nearby rural areas \n\nthrough better road networks and extending service availability to nearby rural residents. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nthe project\u2019s integrated social infrastructure components seek to facilitate the transition of rural \nmigrants to the urban environment by providing them with skills to take advantage of employment \nand income opportunities in emerging communities around the industrial zones. High economic \ngrowth  together  with  improved  business  and  living  environments  resulting  from  project \ninvestments  could  attract  additional  private  sector  investments,  with  spillover  effects  on  small \ncities and county towns along the strategic economic corridor, including Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai. \nThe experience in Changji could serve as a demonstration project for other small cities and towns \nin Xinjiang and the PRC. \n \n8. \nStrategic fit. The proposed project closely aligns with the (i) the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, which aims to balance the development of rural and urban areas to facilitate inclusive \nurbanization  and  industrial  transformation;  (ii)  the  NNUP  (footnote  8),  which  promotes  people-\ncentered urbanization and development of small and medium-sized cities and towns; (iii) the ADB \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020  (footnote  9),  with  strategic  priorities  that \ninclude (a) integrated, green, inclusive, and competitive urban development, focusing on small \nand medium-sized cities in less-developed regions; (b) regional cooperation and integration; and \n(c)  managing  climate  change  and  the  environment;  and  (iv)  the  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan, \n2012\u20132020, which supports green, competitive, and inclusive development.11  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  Changji\u2019s  cities  and  counties\u2019 \nurbanization  and  business  environment  enhanced, 12 and  (ii)  people\u2019s  living  conditions  in  small \ncities  and  towns  improved  (footnote  8).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  services \nprovided by urban\u2013rural infrastructure and environmental features improved.13 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Roads and road ancillary facilities (including utility pipes) constructed or \n10. \nrehabilitated.  The  project  will  (i)  construct  five  roads  of  7.2  km  and  rehabilitate  four  roads  of               \n6.4 km  with  ancillary  facilities,  including  utility  pipes  (water,  wastewater, and  heating),  and the \npurchase of road maintenance equipment for the Fukang urban area; (ii) construct five roads of \n3.4 km  with  ancillary  facilities,  including  utility  pipes  (water,  wastewater, and  heating),  and the \npurchase of road maintenance equipment for Ganhezi Town of Fukang; (iii) construct three roads \nof 8.0 km with ancillary facilities, including utility pipes (water, wastewater, heating, and gas) in \nHutubi; and (iv) construct five roads of 11.4 km with ancillary facilities, including water pipes in \nQitai.  Road  ancillary  facilities  include  underground  utility  pipes;  green  space  with  irrigation \nsystems; ditches, culverts and drainage systems; and road safety facilities, such as light-emitting \ndiode  street  lighting,  signals,  and  signage.  The  roads  will  improve  connectivity  and  facilitate \ntransfer  of  goods,  while  pipe  installations  will  cover  previously  unserved  areas  and  fill  gaps  in \nexisting utility networks. \n \n11. \nOutput 2: Water supply and solid waste management facilities in Qitai improved. In \nQitai, the project will (i) build water transmission pipelines of about 68 km; (ii) construct a domestic \nsolid  waste  sanitary  landfill  with  capacity  of  1.81  million  cubic  meters;  (iii)  close  an  existing \ndomestic solid waste landfill with capacity of 787,000 cubic meters to avoid adverse effects on \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                                                         \n11  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

Design  options  and  alternatives  were  compared  before \nselecting the best possible technologies in terms of cost and environmental and social impacts. \nLandfill site selection and closure of existing landfill will minimize impact on the environment and \nurban  area.  Pavement  structure  and  pipe  foundation  design  considered  local  topography  and \nclimate. Baseline information collected was applied to the design. Capacity building was based \non a needs assessment for successful implementation and operation of project facilities. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis. Economic analyses for all components were prepared in accordance \n22. \nwith  ADB  guidelines.16 Access  roads  were  justified  by  comparing  project  journey  time  savings \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                                                         \n16 ADB. 2017.

For \nroads upgrades, net benefits arise from road-user cost savings. The water supply component will \naugment supplies from sustainable resources to the Qitai urban area, where aquifer depletion is \nincreasingly  limiting  water  availability.  Net  benefits  were  assessed  following  a  survey  of \nwillingness-to-pay  for  improved  supplies.  Similarly,  Qitai\u2019s  landfill  capacity  is  expected  to  be \nexhausted by the end of 2018, so the project will add landfill capacity (net benefits were assessed \nusing the results of the survey). The technical and vocational education and training component \nwill  contribute  to  increasing  worker  educational  and  skill  levels  and  is  justified  using  expected \nwage  increases.  The  benefits  of  ecological  protection  shelterbelts  arise  from  soil  and  water \nconservation  and  carbon  sequestration.  The  present  value  of  benefits  of  all  components  is \nCNY1,321 million and that of costs is CNY1,235 million, giving an overall economic internal rate \nof return estimated at 12.8%. \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  project  has  no  revenue-generating  components.  The  financial \nanalysis,  therefore,  focuses  on  the  ability  of  the  end  borrowers\u2014Fukang,  Hutubi,  and  Qitai \ngovernments\u2014to  service  project  debts  and  provide  counterpart  funds.  ADB  loan  funds  will  be \nchanneled to the project through Xinjiang Finance Department to the Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai \ngovernments. In  addition, the Xinjiang government  provided  assurances (as  noted  in the  legal \ncovenants) on the availability of counterpart funds, and funds for project recurrent expenses. A \nfinancial sustainability analysis was undertaken based on the fiscal impact of the project on the \nfinances  of  Fukang,  Hutubi,  and  Qitai;  it  shows  that  their  commitment  to  the  project  during \nimplementation (October 2017\u2013March 2023), as a percentage of revenue, will be (i) for Fukang, \nfrom 3.40% in 2019 to 0.22% in 2022; (ii) for Hutubi, from 2.35% in 2020 to 0.15% in 2022; and \n(iii)  for  Qitai,  from  6.45%  in  2019  to  0.34%  in  2022.  The  commitment  will  rise  in  2023  (to  an \nestimated 1.17% for Fukang, 0.63% for Hutubi, and 1.27% for Qitai) with commencement of debt \nrepayment,  but  will  decline  beginning  in  2024.  The  Xinjiang  and  PRC  governments  have \naddressed past revenue shortfalls through budget transfers. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nA financial management assessment found that primary financial risks are the (i) financial \nposition of Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai to independently provide funding for (a) counterpart funds \nduring implementation, (b) debt service payments, and (c) funding for operation and maintenance \nafter project completion; and (ii) lack of familiarity on the part of PMO staff with ADB accounting \nand disbursement policy and procedures. The participation of the Xinjiang government through \nthe  Xinjiang  Finance  Department  results  in  a  moderate  overall  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk, with a moderate to substantial risk for the implementing agencies. These risks \nare mitigated through a time-bound action plan for financial and procurement matters, which was \nagreed upon with the PMOs. Given these measures and domestic supervision, the procurement \nand  financial  management  arrangements  are  adequate.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures regarding procurement and financial management are described in the \nPAM. \n \n25. \nA  procurement  risk  assessment  found  that  the  primary  procurement  risk  is  the  lack  of \nknowledge regarding procurement requirements and procedures for ADB-funded projects on the \npart  of  project  implementation  units.  Xinjiang  PMO  will  provide  overall  management  and \nsupervision  based  on  its  extensive  ADB  project  experience,  which  mitigates  this  risk  to  a \nmoderate  level. With  additional  support from the  tendering  agency  and  project  implementation \nconsultants during project implementation, and considering that most of the contract packages \nare common and similar to those procured previously in other ADB projects in Xinjiang managed \nby its PMO, the procurement arrangement is concluded adequate. \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n26. \nThe  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the executing agency. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nIn 2015, the project area had a population of 573,819, with 184,242 households; the poor \npopulation of Changji numbered 26,218, including 15,863 within the project city and counties.17 \nThe project has a direct beneficiary population of 304,159 in the three project city and counties, \nwith 134,675 (44.3%) in urban areas, and 169,484 (55.7%) in rural areas. The project\u2019s indirect \nbeneficiary  population  is  269,660,  including  131,055  (48.6%)  urban  residents,  and  138,605 \n(51.4%)  rural  residents.  The  project  will  generate  202  skilled  and  910  unskilled  jobs  during \nconstruction  and  64  skilled  and  95  unskilled  jobs  during  operations.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies provided assurance that priority for employment will be given to vulnerable \ngroups  such  as  women,  the  poor,  and  ethnic  minorities.  A  social  and  gender  action  plan  was \nprepared to ensure that the positive benefits of the project accrue to the beneficiaries. \n \n28. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \nproject will have significant benefits for women because they are primarily responsible for water \ncollection, solid waste disposal, and related household activities. The social and gender action \nplan will help ensure (i) up to 50% of participants in consultation meetings are women; (ii) women \nare employed for at least 25% of jobs during construction and 30% during operations; (iii) up to \n50%  of  participants  in  gender-sensitive  trainings  on  public  road  safety,  prevention  of \ncommunicable diseases, drugs and human trafficking, environmental awareness, and education \nprograms  on  sanitation  are  women;  (iv)  up  to  60%  of  participants  in  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  short-term  courses  are  women;  and  (v)  appropriate  gender  targets, \nindicators, and sex-disaggregated data are used for project monitoring and evaluation. A social \ndevelopment  specialist  with  gender  expertise  under  output  5  will  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of the social and gender action plan. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \nclassification  is  category  B  for  the  environment  and  indigenous  peoples,  and  category  A  for \ninvoluntary resettlement.18 \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website in April \n2017. The IEE incorporated findings of the domestic feasibility studies and environmental impact \nassessments,  CRVA,  and  technical  assessments.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  and  risks  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through  effective \nimplementation of the EMP. Construction dust, noise, soil erosion, and local disruption to traffic \nand communities will be temporary and localized. During operation, special attention will be given \nto  sustainable  use  of  irrigation  water,  operational  control  of the  proposed  new  sanitary  landfill, \nand  proper  closure  and  rehabilitation  of  the  current  Qitai  landfill  site.  The  EMP  defined  a \nmonitoring  plan  to  verify  the  project\u2019s  environmental  performance.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies are committed to managing the identified environmental risks. The CRVA \n                                                                                         \n17 PRC, Xinjiang, and Changji (Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai). 2015.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n\n\fconcluded that the project area is characterized by (i) low rainfall, which will increase by between \n2% and 3% by 2040 with high yearly variability; and (ii) very low average temperatures, which will \nincrease  by  between  10%  and  20%.  It  recommended  adaptation  measures  for  the  design  of \nbridges,  culverts,  landfill  leachate  treatment,  and  shelterbelts  to  address  these  impacts. \nReductions in greenhouse gas emissions through design and management of roads, irrigation, \nsolid waste recycling plus the carbon sequestration of the project\u2019s forests have been estimated \nat  68,934  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  year  in  2030.  Environmental  management  is \nsupported by a comprehensive set of loan covenants and capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening activities under the project. Environment safeguards documents were disclosed to \nthe affected people. Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance \nwith the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). Three resettlement plans were agreed to by ADB \n31. \nand the government and will be updated during project implementation. The key information in \nthe resettlement plans was disclosed to the affected people and uploaded on the ADB website in \nMarch  2017.  The  project  will  permanently  acquire  an  estimated  10,193  mu  of  land,  consisting \nprimarily  (9,575.44  mu)  of  collective  cultivated  land,  with  the  remainder  residential,  woodland, \ngrassland, and construction land.19 Of the estimated 590 affected households (2,529 persons), \nabout 304 households (1,557 persons) belong to ethnic minority groups (Kazak, Hui, and Uygur), \naccounting for 62% of the total affected population. About 199 households (724 persons) will be \nrequired to relocate; 58 of these households (254 persons) belong to ethnic minority groups, while \n20 households have residential shops. In addition, there were 21 house renters identified. The \nproject will affect the structures of one enterprise with six workers. During resettlement planning, \nthe affected households, villages and communities, village or community leaders, and town and \ntownship  and  county  or city  governments  actively  participated  in the  meaningful consultations, \nrisk assessment, and disclosure activities. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, \ninternal and external monitoring will be carried out, and the required resettlement staff in each \nPMO  has  been  identified  and  will  be  provided  with  the  necessary  training  on  resettlement \nimplementation. The resettlement budget will be made available on a timely basis. All monitoring \nreports will be disclosed and uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n32. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). In 2015, Changji had an ethnic minority population of \nabout 437,800 accounting for 27.4% of the total residents, including Hui (8.8%), Kazakh (10.7%), \nand  Uygur  (5.8%). Within  the  direct  project  areas,  ethnic  minorities  comprise  over  27%  of  the \npopulation.  Although  the  urban  communities  are  ethnically  mixed,  some  differences\u2014e.g., \nrelating to culture, religion, and language\u2014are maintained. Ethnic minorities will not be adversely \naffected,  except  for  1,557  persons  who  belong  to  ethnic  minority  groups  affected  by  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. All households in the urban areas will benefit from the new \nand  upgraded  infrastructure  services.  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been \nprepared and endorsed by the PMOs. The EMDP focuses on measures to facilitate the inclusion \nof  ethnic  minorities  in  all  project  activities,  and  to  ensure  that  their  customs  and  beliefs  are \nrespected throughout project implementation. The EMDP was disclosed to ethnic minorities in the \nareas  targeted  by  the  project  in  their  respective  local  languages,  and  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  in  April  2017.  EMDP  implementation  and  monitoring  is  supported  under  output  5. \nMonitoring and reporting arrangements for the ethnic minority safeguard are included in the PAM \nand the project arrangement. \n \n \n \n\n                                                                                         \n19 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n33. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nChangji project management office \n(CPMO), implementing agencies, and \nproject implementing units lack \nexperience and sufficient capacity in \nimplementing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-financed projects, resulting in \ndelays and mistakes in procurement, \ndisbursement, and construction. \nEntity-specific risks include limited \nunderstanding of roles between XPMO, \nCPMO, implementing agencies, and \nother agencies. \n\nNonperformance of contractors or \nsuppliers. \n\nMitigation Measures \nXinjiang project management office (XPMO), which has extensive \nand proven ADB project experience, will lead all the procurement \nactivities. \nStart-up consultants will be engaged to provide support for project \nreadiness activities. \nA project implementation consultant and a procurement agent will be \nhired to provide ongoing support and training in ADB guidelines and \nprocedures. \nA clear organizational structure involving XPMO, CPMO, and \nimplementing agencies has been established in relation to the \nproject, and separation of roles and responsibilities between parties \nmade clear.
