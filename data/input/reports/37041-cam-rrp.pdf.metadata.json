The  summary \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) on 31 January 2006. \n \nSihanoukville,  Cambodia\u2019s  only  deep-sea  port,  is  a  fast-growing \ncity  with  major  ongoing  developments  to  (i)  expand  the  port \nfacilities,  (ii)  upgrade  the  airport,  and  (iii)  set  up  an  export \nprocessing zone, thus making Sihanoukville an import gateway to \nthe  southern  economic  corridor.  No  power  transmission  grid \nconnects Sihanoukville to the national grid. The city gets its power \nfrom a small, isolated power system based on diesel generators. \nThis mode of power generation is expensive, inefficient, as it does \nnot  achieve  economies  of  scale,  and  cannot  meet  the  demand. \nThe  Project  will  complement  previous \nthe \ntransmission  and  distribution  facilities.  It  will  (i)  extend  the \n230 kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  from  Kampot  to  Sihanoukville, \n(ii) build  associated  substations  and  bulk  supply  distribution \nfacilities, and (iii) carry out institutional development and capacity \nbuilding for Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC). \n \nThe  power  sector  in  Cambodia  is  highly  fragmented,  with  24 \nisolated  power  systems  centered  on  the  various  provincial  cities. \nThe  lack  of  an  integrated  high-voltage  transmission  system, \ncoupled  with  the  high  cost  of  imported  diesel  fuel,  has  made \nelectricity  in  Cambodia  among  the  costliest  in  the  world.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  the  high  cost  of  electricity  and \ninadequate supply significantly limits economic growth and hinder \nthe country from attracting investments and stimulating economic \nactivities.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  are  assisting  the \nGovernment in building 230 kV backbone transmission lines in the \nsouthern  part  of  the  country,  originating  at  a  substation  on  the \nborder with Viet Nam and passing through Takeo to Kampot and \nalso  to  Phnom  Penh.  These  facilities  will  allow  EDC  to  import \nlower-cost  electricity  from  Viet Nam  at  $0.05\u2013$0.07  per  kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh)  (at  off-peak  and  peak  hours)  to  meet  the  power \ndemand \nin  Phnom  Penh,  Takeo,  Kampot,  and,  ultimately, \nSihanoukville. \n\ninvestments \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\nThe  transmission  lines  and  distribution  facilities  to  be  built  under \nthe  Project  are  priority  investments  in  the  planned  national \nbackbone power grid included in EDC\u2019s transmission master plan. \nBy  extending  the  transmission  line  and  distribution  systems,  the \nProject  will  (i)  provide  reliable,  sufficient,  and  less  costly  power \nsupply  to  Sihanoukville  and  Kampot  provinces,  including  rural \nareas  along  the  transmission  line  corridor;  (ii)  reduce  tariffs  for \nconsumers;  (iii)  reduce  distribution  losses;  and  (iv)  make  the \ncommercial  and  industrial  sectors  more  competitive.  The  bulk \nsupply  distribution  component  will  provide  reliable  medium-  and \nlow-voltage supplies to rural villages along the transmission line. \n \nThe Project will (i) extend the 230 kV power grid from Kampot to \nSihanoukville  and  provide  reliable  supply  of  electricity  at \naffordable  prices  to  consumers  in  Sihanoukville  and  adjacent \nareas  along  the  transmission  corridor,  (ii)  increase  connections, \n(iii) stimulate economic growth in the southern economic corridor, \nand  (iv)  improve  EDC\u2019s  operational  efficiency  and  performance \nthrough institutional development and capacity building. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $52.36 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $8.36 million.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB Loan (Special Fund) \nJBIC Loan \nGovernment Funds \n\nTotal \n\n($ million) \nTotal \n20.00 \n22.30 \n10.06 \n52.36 \n\n%  \n38.0 \n43.0 \n19.0 \n100.0 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $20.00  million  from  its  Special  Fund \nresources.

Project  engineering  and  construction  will  be \ncontracted out, and the contracts will be administered by EDC.  \n \nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n \nGoods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan will be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). The \nmajor  works  for  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  Project  will  be \n(i) a turnkey contract for the civil works for three substations, and \n(ii) the improvement of the EDC information system.  \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  during  implementation  to \nassist EDC in (i) preparing preliminary designs and bid documents \nfor  the  bidding  of  the  works;  (ii)  evaluating  bids;  (iii)  supervising \ninstallation  and  construction;  (iv)  carrying  out  final  testing  and \ncommissioning; \nassurance; \nperforming \n(vi)   implementing  the  environmental  management  plan,  the \nresettlement  plan,  and  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation \nprogram;  and  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  performance  of \nthe  Project.  About  40  person-months  of  international  and  45 \nperson-months of national consultant inputs will be required. EDC \nwill  recruit  the  consultants  through  a  firm,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2006)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  hiring  of \nnational consultants.  \n \nAdequate and reliable supply of power to industry and commercial \nconsumers  will  enable  the  sustainable  development  of  these \nsectors and promote socioeconomic development in the southern \nregion.  The  project  benefits  will  be  increased  revenues  to  the \nGovernment  and  EDC  and  reduced  costs \nto  consumers, \nparticularly  those  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  using \nprivate  generation  facilities  without  the  Project.  In  addition,  rural \nhouseholds  along  the  transmission  line  corridor  will  have  access \nto electricity for the first time. The provision of firm capacity supply \nwill  allow  the  diesel  generators  to  be  decommissioned,  thus \nreducing air pollution. The Project\u2019s net present value of economic \nbenefits is estimated at $17.4 million.

The key risks \nare  (i)  lower-than-expected  demand  for  electricity,  (ii)  insufficient \nelectricity supply from Viet Nam, (iii) delay in the creation of export \ntariff  and \nprocessing  zone \nconnection  charges,  discouraging  large-scale  consumers  from \nswitching from their own generation sources to EDC\u2019s grid supply. \nEconomic  growth  has  been  strong  and  is  envisaged  to  continue, \nresulting in an increased demand for electricity. Viet Nam\u2019s power \ndemand  is  also  increasing  but  the  Government  is  committed  in \nhonoring the power purchase agreement it signed with Cambodia. \nViet Nam is an active member of the GMS Regional Power Trade \nCoordinating Committee and supports this power interconnection. \nBy  importing  lower-priced  electricity  from  Viet  Nam,  the  Project \nwill allow EDC to keep tariffs low to ensure connections by large-\nscale  industrial  consumers.  In  addition,  the  Government  will \nreview tariffs to ensure that proper tariffs and connection charges \nthat reflect best international practices are set. \n \nEDC\u2019s  weak  financial  performance  is  a  potential  risk.  Concrete \nand  achievable  financial  indicators  have  been  developed  and \nagreed  on with  the  Government.  These  will  be  closely  monitored \nduring project implementation. \n \nCompensation,  resettlement,  and  income-restoration  measures \nmight  not  be  delivered  as  agreed,  thereby  impoverishing  the \naffected people and delaying the start of civil works. EDC will hire \ninternational  and  national  resettlement  specialists  to  assist  in  the \npreparation and implementation of resettlement plans. The Project \nwill ensure that the impact of resettlement is further minimized by \ncarefully locating the towers during detailed design. EDC will hire \nan independent organization to monitor the resettlement activities \nthroughout. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nCambodia  has  a  small  population  of  about  13  million,  of  which  about  one  third  live  in \npoverty.  The  country\u2019s  infrastructure  was  largely  destroyed  during  decades  of  civil  war  and \nconflict,  and  its  socioeconomic  indicators  are  relatively  lower  than  elsewhere  in  the  region. \nSince  peace  and  stability  has  been  achieved  only  in  the  last  few  years,  the  Government  of \nCambodia  (the  Government)  is  taking  measures  to  further  improve  its  economic  base  and \nstimulate economic growth. But to achieve this, Cambodia must improve its basic infrastructure. \n\nThe  power  sector  in  Cambodia  is  both  small  and  highly  fragmented,  with  24  isolated \n3. \npower  systems  covering  various  provincial  cities  and  the  capital,  Phnom  Penh.  About  85%  of \nthe population lives in the rural areas and most have no access to electricity. Nationwide, less \nthan 17% of the population has access to electricity supply. Electricity consumption per capita is \nestimated at 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2004, one of the lowest in the region.1 In addition, the \nlack  of  an  integrated  high-voltage  transmission  system,  the  absence  of  interconnections  with \nneighboring countries, and the high cost of imported diesel fuel have raised electricity prices in \nCambodia  to  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  after  Japan. 2  Since  Cambodia  has  limited \nindigenous energy sources,3 it relies primarily on imported diesel, which is expensive for power \ngeneration.  The  lack  of  adequate  and  affordable  electricity  supply  is  a  main  constraint  on \neconomic  growth.  Given  the  importance  of  electricity  in  stimulating  economic  growth,  this \nconstraint, if not removed, will significantly limit growth and hinder the country\u2019s ability to attract \ninvestments that would stimulate economic activities, create employment, and reduce poverty. \n\n4. \nCambodia  has  begun  to  rehabilitate  its  infrastructure  with  support  from  development \npartners. Power demand has increased significantly, at 12% per year on average from 2000 to \n2005.  Increasing  access  to  electricity,  especially  in  provincial  and  rural  areas,  is  essential  to \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  gives  priority  to  establishing  a  national  power  grid  and  expanding  it  to  unserved \nareas. \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  assist  it  in \n5. \nexpanding  its  power  transmission  network  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country,  including \nconstructing  a  new  high-voltage  230  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  linking  Cambodia  and \nViet Nam  to  allow  Cambodia  to  import  reliable  low-cost  power.  ADB  approved  a  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)4 in January 2003. The first component of this TA entailed \na  feasibility  study  of  a  230  kV  transmission  line  from  the  Vietnamese  border  to  Takeo  and \n\n                                                 \n1  In  comparison,  that  same  year  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  consumed  206  KWh  per  capita,  Viet Nam \n\n550 kWh, and Thailand 1,890 kWh. \n\n2  Commercial and industrial users are now charged $0.21/kWh, and residential users $0.10/kWh. In comparison, the \naverage  retail  tariffs  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  are  around  $0.04/kWh, \n$0.07/ kWh, and $0.06/ kWh, respectively. \n\n3   Offshore findings of oil and gas have been reported but these will be confirmed in 2007, when ongoing drillings are \n\ncompleted and the results evaluated. \n\n4  ADB.  2003.

An  ADB  loan  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transmission  Project 5 was \napproved  in  December  2003.  The  project  is  now  being  implemented  and  the  230  kV \ntransmission line is expected to be commissioned in early 2008. The second component of the \nTA  was  a  feasibility  study  of  the  construction  of  a  230  kV6 transmission  line  from  Kampot  to \nSihanoukville  and  the  associated  distribution  system.  The  TA\u2019s  findings  led  to  a  visit  to \nCambodia by an ADB fact-finding mission from 22 November to 1 December 2005. This report \nis based on the agreements reached with the Government during the mission. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the proposed project is in Appendix 1. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategies \n\n6. \nThe  Government  has  drawn  up  policies  to  accelerate  pro-poor  economic  growth  in \nconjunction with its socioeconomic development plans. In 2004, the Government put together its \nRectangular  Strategy,  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  guide  the  country\u2019s  development  with \nemphasis on agriculture, the private sector, infrastructure, and capacity building. Acknowledging \nthe importance of the power sector in the overall development of the country, the Government \nmade  the  establishment  of  a  reliable  power  supply  and  transmission  grid  a  top  priority  in  the \nstrategy. \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy 7  aims  to  provide  adequate, \n7. \nreliable,  and  stable  power  supply  at  affordable  prices  throughout  the  country.  The  key  policy \nframework  consists  of  (i)  intensifying  investments  in  power  generation  and  transmission, \n(ii) connecting  Cambodia\u2019s  transmission  lines  to  the  power  grids  in  neighboring  countries  to \nallow  Cambodia  to  import  lower-cost  electricity  and  possibly  engage  in  power  trading  in  the \nfuture,  (iii)  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (iv)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation,  and  (v)  expanding  provincial  and  rural  electrification.  The  Government  is  also \ncommitted to providing reliable and affordable electricity service to 90% of villages and 70% of \nrural  households  by  2030.  To  meet  the  growing  demand  for  electricity,  the  Government  is \ndeveloping  a  nationwide  high-voltage  transmission  system  as  a  backbone  to  give  provincial \ncenters  access  to  electricity  from  efficient,  large-scale  power  stations,  and  other  low-cost \nsources of imported power. \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy8 \n\nThe  power  sector  plays  a  key  role  in  economic  growth  and  social  development  in \n8. \nCambodia. ADB\u2019s approach is to assist the Government in achieving its development objectives \nas  stated  in  the  Rectangular  Strategy  by  providing  continuing  support  for  power  sector \ndevelopment. ADB\u2019s development assistance strategy is to focus on (i) expanding the country\u2019s \nbackbone power transmission and distribution systems to unserved areas and providing reliable \nand  affordable  power  supply  to  consumers,  (ii)  improving  sector  performance  and  operational \nefficiency  through  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building,  (iii)  promoting  tariff  reform \nand  adopting  sound  development  strategies  and  policies  to  maintain  sustainable  and  efficient \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

Such  an  integrated  approach  will  reinforce  investment \nprojects,  thereby  maximizing  efforts and  lowering  costs  through  economies  of  scale.  Thus  far, \nADB  has  provided  four  loans  totaling  about  $110  million  to  finance  power  sector  projects  in \nCambodia. These loans are the Special Rehabilitation Assistance in 1992, Power Rehabilitation \nProject  in  1994,  Provincial  Power  Supply  Project  in  2000,  and  GMS  Transmission  Project  in \n2003 (refer to para. 17 and Appendix 2). \n\n3. \n\nPower Sector Performance and Development Strategies \n\n9. \nThe provision of power is the responsibility of Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodia (EDC), under the \noverall supervision of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME). MIME is responsible \nfor formulating and implementing policies, strategies, and plans, and for setting guidelines and \nstandards. EDC owns and operates small power-generating plants that are fueled by expensive \nlight diesel and heavy fuel oil. EDC also purchases more than 50% of the power it distributes to \nits customers in Phnom Penh and 13 provincial towns from independent power producers (IPPs) \nat costs that range from $0.11/kWh to $0.17/kWh.  \n\n10. \nSihanoukville  is  Cambodia\u2019s  only  deep-sea  port  and  is  growing  fast.  There  are  major \nongoing development projects to (i) expand the existing port infrastructure facilities to handle the \nincrease in container traffic, (ii) establish an export-processing zone with backward linkages that \nwould  increase  employment,  and  (iii)  upgrade  and  expand  the  domestic  airport  to  handle \ninternational flights and attract tourists to Sihanoukville\u2019s beaches. Sihanoukville is also a part of \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Southern  Economic  Corridor  Project,  one  of  the  three \ncore projects of the GMS economic cooperation program.9 \n\n11. \nPower  supply  in  Sihanoukville  is  now  based  on  diesel  generators  that  provide  about \n20 gigawatt-hours (GWh) with a peak demand of 5 megawatts (MW) for 8,000 consumers (as of \n2004).  The  coverage  of  the  distribution  system  is  limited  to  the  town,  beach  resorts,  and  port \nareas, and some villages along National Road 4. In 1998, ADB assisted EDC in installing a 5 \nMW  diesel  generator  in  Sihanoukville  and  upgrading  the  distribution  system. 10  However, \nbecause  of  the  high  growth  in  power  demand,  the  power  system  is  once  again  severely \nconstrained and unable to meet the demand. EDC needs to purchase another 5 MW of power \nfrom  IPPs  or  add  another  5  MW  of  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  of  its \npresent  customers.  Electricity  consumers,  particularly  commercial  and  industrial  consumers, \nface the problem of high electricity tariffs. Rather than connecting to the power grid, many major \nconsumers choose to generate their own electricity as they can ensure reliability of supply and it \nis  cheaper  to  generate.  Self-generation  cost  is  around  $0.14/kWh  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs.  The  present  captive  energy  demand11 in  Sihanoukville  is  estimated  to  be \nmore than 20 GWh. \n\nTo ensure reliable electricity supply to meet the growing demand and sustain economic \n12. \ngrowth, EDC needs to import additional power at lower cost from neighboring countries. ADB, \n\n                                                 \n9  An  economic  corridor  is  a  geographic  area  in  which  infrastructure  is  linked  directly  with  trade,  investment,  and \nproduction  opportunities.  Three  economic  corridors\u2014north\u2013south,  east\u2013west,  and  southern\u2014are  being \nimplemented as the flagship programs of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) with the endorsement of the GMS \ncountry  leaders.  The  GMS  countries  are  Cambodia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, \n\n10 ADB.  1994.

Manila (Loan 1345-CAM[SF]). \n\n11 Captive demand refers to the energy consumption by those consumers that currently supply their own needs with \ndiesel generators or have access to private power supply from diesel generators. These consumers will shift to the \nEDC power grid once it is available. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ntogether  with  other  development  partners,  is  assisting  EDC  in  importing  reliable  and  cheaper \npower from Viet Nam through the construction of a 230 kV high-voltage bulk transmission line, \nwhich is scheduled for commissioning in 2008 (footnote 4). The transmission line comes from a \nsubstation  at  the  Vietnamese  border  through  Takeo  to  Phnom  Penh.  It  will  evacuate  a  total \ncapacity  of  200  MW  at  tariffs  lower  than  the  generating  cost  in  Phnom  Penh.12 In  parallel,  a \n230 kV  transmission  line  from  Takeo  to  Kampot  will  be  built  under  a  grant  funded  by  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW).13 This transmission line \nwill also be commissioned in 2008. This interconnection will relieve the strain on the country\u2019s \ngeneration  capacity  and  also  stimulate  economic  growth  in  the  southern  provinces  of  Takeo, \nKampot, and Sihanoukville. \n\n13. \nThe proposed project will directly complement previous investments in transmission and \ndistribution  facilities.  It  will  extend  the  230  kV  transmission  line  from  Kampot  to  Sihanoukville, \nthus providing efficient and economical means to electrify those areas. The Project is identified \nas a priority project in the Government\u2019s current investment plan (2005\u20132020) (footnote 7). The \npower sector is analyzed in detail in Appendix 3. \n\n4. \n\nRural Electrification and Private Sector Participation \n\n14. \nThe  provision  of  electricity  to  rural  areas  has  been  recognized  as  a  key  to  reducing \npoverty  in  rural  areas.  With  help  from  the  World  Bank,  the  Government  has  established  the \nRural Electrification and Renewable Energy Fund, which will promote private sector participation \nin rural electrification and renewable energy development. \n\n15. \nEDC  has  developed  a  rural  electrification  program,  which  consists  of  grid  extension  in \nthe outlying areas of major provincial towns, including Sihanoukville and Kampot, with the aim of \nachieving  about  13,000  new  connections  in  these  two  areas.  The  Project  will  assist  EDC  in \nproviding  electricity  supply  to  these  rural  areas.  This  will  be  done  on  a  least-cost  basis,  using \nconventional 22 kV feeders for villages in the vicinity of the provincial towns. \n\n16. \nRural  electricity  enterprises  (REEs)  provide  electricity  services  in  small  towns  and \nvillages. These private entrepreneurs supply power to a few hundred local residents and small \ncommercial establishments. However, they supply power to end users at a cost that far exceeds \nEDC\u2019s, and for only 4 to 6 hours a day. Supplying bulk electricity power to REEs to enable them \nto supply the rural areas is the most realistic business model in the absence of a transmission \ngrid. In addition, EDC does not have the capability or the resources to provide electricity to such \nareas  with  low  customer  density.  Furthermore,  there  are  about  600  existing  REEs  that  could \npurchase electricity at the transformer terminal and distribute it to their customers. The Project \nwill therefore assist REEs in expanding their business and connecting more rural customers by \nbuilding distribution facilities.  \n\n                                                 \n12 A  power  purchase  agreement  between  EDC  and  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  was  signed  in  2004.  Tariffs  agreed  with \nViet Nam range from $0.05/kWh to $0.07/kWh for off-peak and peak periods. EDC will sell the purchased power to \nthe grid at $0. 08/kWh, which is lower than the cost of captive power generation. \n\n13 The  financing  and  project  agreement  between  KfW  and  the  Government  was  signed  in  September  2005.  The \n\nproject is being implemented as scheduled. \n\n\f5. \n\nLessons \n\nOf the four ADB-financed projects, two projects have been completed,14 while two others \n17. \nare  still  being  implemented. 15  The  experience  from  these  projects  shows  EDC\u2019s  strong \ncommitment  and  generally  satisfactory  technical  capabilities  in  implementing  power  projects. \nBut  EDC\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  deal  with  resettlement  and  environmental  management  is \nweak,  and  poor  implementation  has  delayed  resettlement.  In  addition,  deficiencies  in \nresettlement implementation have not been brought to light because of inadequate monitoring. \nEDC  needs  better  institutional  arrangements  and  more  capacity  building  in  resettlement  and \nenvironmental management. ADB has provided technical assistance under Loan 2052 for social \nand  environmental  management,  and  will  continue  to  do  so  for  this  proposed  project.  EDC  is \nstrengthening  its  Environment  and  Social  Unit.  The  Inter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee \n(IRC)  is  also  improving  its  resettlement  management  capacity.  ADB  is  providing  separate \ntechnical  assistance  to  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  legal  framework  and \ninstitutional arrangements and its capacity for involuntary resettlement.16 \n\n18. \nThe  completed  projects  also  highlighted  the  need  to  (i)  continuously  improve  the \ncapacity  of  EDC  in  project  processing  and  implementation,  (ii)  increase  efficiency  and \ntransparency  in  budget  utilization,  (iii)  formulate  and  implement  anticorruption  measures,  and \n(iv) involve local communities and stakeholders in the identification and prioritization of project \nactivities  for  resettlement  and  environmental  management.  These  lessons  have  been \nincorporated  into  the  proposed  project.  The  Project  will  further  strengthen  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  capacity  of  EDC\u2019s  provincial  branches.  A  procurement  committee  consisting  of \nrepresentatives from government agencies concerned will be formed to ensure that all project-\nrelated  activities,  including  anticorruption  measures,  are  being  carried  out  as  planned  (paras. \n46\u201347). \n\n6. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n19.  While  the  Project  will  assist  EDC  in  expanding  and  reinforcing  its  transmission  and \ndistribution facilities, it will also continue the policy dialogue with the energy sector to expedite \npolicy  formulation  and  institutional  reform  in  (i)  formulating  and  adopting  a  comprehensive \nenergy sector strategy and implementation plan that is costed, (ii) improving EDC\u2019s financial and \noperational  efficiency  (paras.  23\u201327),  and  (iii)  carrying  out  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building (para. 33). \n\n20. \nEnergy sector development is constrained by a number of related factors including lack \nof  sound  sector  policy  and  legal  framework,  limited  access  to  the  capital  market  for \nimprovements  in  system  operations,  high  generation  costs  resulting  in  high  tariffs,  and \nunreliable power supply. The Government recognizes that it must develop a strategic framework \nto  govern  the  systematic  development  of  the  energy  sector  in  Cambodia  and  lead  to  the \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  1992.

With  assistance  from  its  development \npartners, the Government is carrying out a major exercise\u2014the Energy Sector Strategy Review \n(ESSR)17 programmed over a 3-year period from 2005 to 2007. The stakeholders have agreed \nthat  a  government-owned  sector  development  strategy  with  the  funding  agencies\u2019  full \nparticipation would be the basis for a sector-wide approach to future assistance. The ESSR will \nassess  the  performance  of  the  sector,  diagnose  key  deficiencies,  and  develop  appropriate \nstrategies  and  implementation  plans  within  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks,  and \nprioritized investment programs. \n\nEDC  has  not  complied  satisfactorily  with  financial  covenants  under  previous  loans.  By \n21. \nthe  end  of  2005,  it  was  able  to  meet  only  the  debt-equity  ratio  covenant,  and  to  reduce  its \ntransmission and distribution losses. But it has not complied with the debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR), accounts receivable from government agencies, and revenue breakeven covenants. \n\n22. \nEDC\u2019s  poor  financial  performance  is  due  to  (i)  steep  increases  in  fuel  oil  price, \n(ii) depreciation  of  the  local  currency,  (iii)  high  price  of  power  purchases  from  IPPs  in  the  late \n1990s,  (iv)  small  (uneconomical)  size  of  diesel  generation  plants,  and  (v)  high  level  of  duties \nand  taxes  levied  by  the  Government  on  imported  fuel  and  spare  parts.  EDC\u2019s  financial \nperformance  is  also  affected  by  late  electricity  payments  by  some  line  ministries  due  to \ninsufficient  budget  or  improper  use  of  budget  allocation  for  other  purposes.  These  problems \nhave been further compounded by the lack of timely action from the Government to address the \nproblems, to refund the value-added taxes to EDC, and to introduce automatic tariff adjustments \nto cover oil price increases and foreign exchange fluctuations that would permit EDC to meet its \nannual revenue requirements. \n\n23.  While  EDC  has  made  considerable  progress  in  its  operations  in  the  last  decade,  a \nnumber  of  financial  issues  still  need  to  be  addressed.  The  Government,  recognizing  EDC\u2019s \nfinancial  situation,  took  action  in  2005  to  increase  EDC\u2019s  tariff  in  Phnom  Penh  and  Kandal \nprovince.  Effective  1  July  2005,  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC)  revised  the  tariff \ncategory  of  major  consumers  in  these  two  service  areas  of  EDC  to  rationalize  tariffs  by \n(i) introducing an automatic foreign exchange adjustment to the cost of EDC's power purchases, \n(ii)  having  one  tariff  level  for  both  industrial  and  commercial  (small  and  medium)  consumers, \n(iii) rationalizing the lifeline tariffs, and (iv) applying one tariff rate for the entire consumption of \nresidential consumers. A second action on electricity tariffs taken by the Government to further \nimprove  the  financial  position  of  EDC  increased  the  lifeline  tariff  and  applied  automatic \nadjustments  for  all  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  not  only  in  Phnom  Penh  but  also  in \nKandal  and  Kampong  Speu  provinces.  The  new  power  tariffs,  which  also  raised  the  average \ntariffs by 11%, took effect on 1 November 2005.  \n\n24. \nThe Government has increased the budget allocation for electricity payments and settled \npart  of  the  past-due  arrears.  The  total  government  arrears  were  reduced  from  KR47  billion  in \n2004 to KR28.8 billion by December 2005, representing about 3 weeks of electricity sales. The \nGovernment has helped EDC maintain a satisfactory debt-to-equity ratio by converting debt of \naround $60 million to equity. The debt-to-equity ratio improved from 58:42 in 1999 to 48:52 in \n\n                                                 \n17 The Energy Sector Strategy Review is a major policy review exercise programmed from 2005 to 2007, to create a \nstrategic framework that would govern the systematic development of the energy sector in Cambodia. The exercise \nwill  be  participatory,  with  the  Government  taking  the  lead  and  funding  agencies  including  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  JBIC,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), \nand the World Bank contributing. Major outputs include an update of the power development master plan, studies \non renewable energy strategy and power sector efficiency, a review of infrastructure, a hydropower master plan, a \nrural electrification master plan, a regulatory framework for the oil and gas industry, and an energy sector strategy \nand implementation plan. \n\n\f2005. If total tariff increases are taken into account, EDC\u2019s financial performance has improved \nand should achieve breakeven in revenue terms by 2007. \n\n25. \nThe Government is also committed to taking further measures including (i) renegotiating \nand  purchasing  more  electricity  through  competitive  bidding  from  various  IPPs  and  importing \nlower-cost  electricity  from  neighboring  countries,  (ii)  settling  past  arrears  of  line  ministries \nthrough  budget  allocation,  and  (iii)  continuously  reducing  EDC\u2019s  system \nlosses.  The \nGovernment has prepared a time-bound action plan, outlining concrete steps to fully reimburse \nEDC  for  the  past  arrears  of  line  ministries  as  of  the  end  of  2005  and  for  VAT  (para.  74\u201375). \nDetails of EDC\u2019s financial performance and projections are given in Appendix 4. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n26. \nThe Project will (i) directly expand the 230 kV power transmission grid from Kampot to \nSihanoukville  to  provide  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  supply  at  affordable  prices  to \nconsumers in Sihanoukville and adjacent areas along the transmission corridor, and (ii) improve \nEDC\u2019s  operational  efficiency  and  performance  through  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding. \n\nThe  first  outcome  will  be  achieved  by  facilitating  the  importation  of  electricity  from \n27. \nViet Nam  through  the  project  transmission  lines,  thus  providing  sustainable  and  reliable \nelectricity  supply  at  a  lower  cost  than  any  alternative,  and  improving  EDC\u2019s  financial  position. \nCurrently,  the  EDC  tariff  in  Sihanoukville  ranges  from  $0.13  to  $0.20  per  kWh.  In  rural  towns, \nREEs  supply  electricity  at  tariffs  as  high  as  $0.38\u2013$0.63/kWh.  Through  the  Project,  electricity \nfrom  Viet  Nam  will  have  a  delivered  electricity  price  in  Sihanoukville  of  around  $0.08/kWh, \nincluding losses, operation and maintenance, and all taxes. This will greatly ease the burden of \nconsumers  by  enabling  them  to  use  the  savings  for  other  purposes  (education,  health,  or \nbusiness),  and  promote  sustainable  economic  development.  Rural  villages  and  communities \nclose to the transmission line that are currently not served will also be supplied with electricity.  \n\n28. \nThe Project will also assist the Government in four key areas: (i) reducing electricity cost \nand  formulating  sound  tariff  policies,  (ii)  enhancing  EDC\u2019s  financial  performance,  (iii)  reducing \ndistribution losses, and (iv) improving the efficiency of EDC\u2019s operations. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  has  two  major  components.  Part  A  will  focus  on  the  infrastructure \n29. \ncomponents,  while  part  B  will  entail  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building.  The \nProject\u2019s infrastructure components were developed following technical, economic, and financial \nstudies  that  took  environmental  and  social  aspects  into  consideration.  The  feasibility  study \n(footnote  4)  considered  various  alternatives  for  power  supply  to  Sihanoukville  and  involved  a \nleast-cost analysis, including comparisons of power supply from diesel generation, transmission \nline, generators, etc. The study concluded that developing a double-circuit 230 kV transmission \nline  and  associated  distribution  facilities  was  the  most  cost-effective  option  for  the  supply  of \nelectricity in the target areas. \n\n30. \n\nPart A comprises five subcomponents:  \n\n(i) \n\nExtension of 230 kV transmission line. The high-voltage 230 kV double-circuit \ntransmission  lines  will  be  extended  from  Kampot  to  Sihanoukville,  for  a  total \nlength of about 78 kilometers (km). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn part B, the operating efficiency and performance of EDC will be improved. Part B will \n\n31. \nhave the following four subcomponents: \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nConstruction of substations. A new 230 kV grid substation at Veal Renh, a 230 \nkV/22 kV substation in Sihanoukville, and a 230 kV line bay at Kampot substation \nwill be built. \n\nConstruction  of  medium-  and  low-voltage  distribution  system.  The  Project \nwill put up conventional medium-voltage 22 kV double-circuit distribution lines in \nSihanoukville connecting to the 230 kV substation and the existing 22 kV network, \nand 22 kV feeders from Sihanoukville and Veal Renh substations serving nearby \nvillages.  To  serve  the  villages  along  the  transmission  line  corridor,  22  kV  and \n400 V distribution lines will also be erected. \n\nConsulting  services  to  assist  EDC  in  detailed  project  design,  implementation \nsupervision, and other capacity-building support. \n\nProject  management  and  monitoring  activities,  including  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  environmental  mitigation,  monitoring,  training  for  EDC  staff  in \nenvironmental management, and resettlement implementation. \n\nStrengthening  of  EDC\u2019s  provincial  operations.  With  the  extension  of  the \npower  grid,  EDC\u2019s  operation  and  maintenance  capacity  in  Sihanoukville  and \nKampot  provinces  will  also  need  to  be  strengthened.  The  provincial  branches \nnow operate the diesel generators, maintain the distribution system, and collect \nthe  electricity  charge.  When  outages  occur,  EDC  sends  technical  staff  from \nheadquarters for system recovery. The Project will strengthen the EDC branches \nin Sihanoukville and Kampot by providing the necessary vehicles and equipment \nto detect outage points, thus speeding up system recovery and reducing its cost. \n\nTraining  in  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  high-voltage  transmission \nsystem.  Considering  the  number  of  staff  required  to  operate  the  high-voltage \ntransmission system to be developed in the coming decade, EDC staff will need \ncontinuous and increasingly more advanced training. \n\nImprovement  of  EDC\u2019s  data  management  system.  EDC\u2019s  critical  statistical \ndata  are  now  scattered  in  its  headquarters  and  branch  offices,  hampering \ncentralized  activities  such  as  backup,  reporting,  processing,  and  management. \nThe  Project  will  support  EDC  in  establishing  a  consolidated  data  platform \nincluding  reliable  backup  systems  and  improved  communication  systems \nbetween headquarters and branches, by procuring the necessary hardware and \nsoftware.  EDC  can  thus  efficiently  maintain  electronic  information  and  improve \ncustomer billing, archiving, and services. 18 \n\nin  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental \nTraining  of  EDC  staff \nmanagement.  EDC  is  striving  to  strengthen  its  capacity  by  recruiting  more \nqualified  staff  and  providing  on-the-job  training.  The  Project  will  finance  higher-\nlevel  education  for  two  social  and  environmental  specialists  from  existing  EDC \nstaff at appropriate agencies in ASEAN countries. \n\n                                                 \n18 This component is an incremental step with a budget of $500,000 and will supplement EDC\u2019s existing programs to \ncentralize and archive customer and billing records. The proposed work involves installing and commissioning the \nstorage  and  data  management  system  and  its  tape  backup  system  including  hardware  and  software  installation, \ntraining, and other customer support services. \n\n\fC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nThe Project has a regional cooperation focus. It forms part of the planned transmission \nbackbone grid: the transmission lines between Cambodia and Viet Nam will be connected to the \ngrid. Through the Project, EDC will be able to provide the southern provinces with reliable and \naffordable electricity from the lowest-cost source of power. The Project will increase importation \nof  power  from  Viet  Nam  by  around  50  MW  by  2015  and  will  thus  benefit  both  Viet  Nam  and \nCambodia. The Project will also contribute to the economic development of the GMS Southern \nEconomic  Corridor,  a  flagship  program  of  GMS  economic  cooperation,  by  providing  basic \neconomic infrastructure. \n\n33. \nThe  provision  of  firm  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity  to  Sihanoukville  would  allow  the \ndecommissioning  of  the  low-efficiency  and  high-cost  diesel  generating  plants  (around  5  MW). \nLarge consumers, who now run their own small, low-efficiency diesel generators (estimated at \n10 MW), will connect to the EDC power grid when cheap and reliable power becomes available. \nThus, EDC, the private sector, and the country as a whole will spend less foreign exchange on \nfuel imports and also benefit from reduced environmental pollution. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n34. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $52.36 million equivalent. The cost estimates \nare based on 2005 price levels for base costs. Physical contingencies were estimated at 10% of \nbase  costs,  and  price  contingencies  were  calculated  using  ADB\u2019s  current  rates  of  inflation  for \nlocal and foreign goods and services. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and set out \nin detail in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n35. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  for  a  loan  of  $20  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund to help finance the Project. The ADB loan will finance 38% of total project \ncosts. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% during principal amortization, and such other terms and \nconditions as are set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n\nin  supporting \n\n36. \nThe  Government  of  Japan  supports  the  construction  of  transmission  lines  and  the \nexpansion of substations to promote stable electric supply through the importation of electricity \nfrom neighboring countries. In this context, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is \nlies  between \ninterested \nKampong Cham,  Phnom  Penh,  and  Sihanoukville.  JBIC  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  for  a \nJapanese  yen  loan  of  about  $22.3  million  equivalent  for  the  transmission  and  distribution  line \npackages and part of the capacity-building activities, representing 43% of total project cost. The \nGovernment  will  fund  $10.06  million  of  local  project  costs,  representing  19%  of  total  project \ncosts. If cofinancing does not materialize, the scope of the Project may have to be reconsidered. \nThe financing plan based on these initial assumptions is presented in Table 2. \n\nthe  southern  economic  growth  corridor,  which \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \nItem \n \nA.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance will relend the ADB loan to EDC for a loan of 20-\nyear  maturity,  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  at  an  interest  rate  of  4.2%,  and  will  relend  the \nJBIC  loan  on  the  same  terms.  EDC  will  bear  the  Government\u2019s  foreign  exchange  risk  on  the \nproposed loan. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n38. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  will  be  EDC.  EDC  has  implemented  two \nADB-funded projects in the power sector, and is implementing two other projects (footnote 15), \nin  the  process  demonstrating  that  it  has  adequate  capacity  to  implement  similar  projects.  The \nProject will be implemented by a project management unit. To ensure continuous improvement \nof EDC\u2019s project management capacity, the project management unit will consist of EDC staff \nthat  have  been  part  of  previous  ADB-financed  transmission  line  projects.  During  project \nimplementation, EDC will also be assisted by a team of international and national consultants. \nEDC  will  assign  at  least  three  experienced  and  qualified  engineers  full-time  to  coordinate  and \nwork with the consultants. EDC will also appoint two recent graduates in environment and social \nscience to its Environment and Resettlement Unit to gain experience through on-the-job training. \nThe  consultants  and  the  seconded  EDC  staff  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  executed  on  time \nand according to international standards. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  from  the  first  quarter  of  FY2007.  The \n39. \nphysical works are expected to be completed by the end of 2009. After that, the contractor will \ntrain EDC staff for 6 months to operate and maintain the transmission lines. The implementation \nschedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n\nResettlement work will begin shortly after the appointment of the project implementation \n40. \nconsultants  (PICs)  and  independent  monitoring  organization  and  after  detailed  design,  with \nfieldwork  for  the  detailed  measurement  survey  to  confirm  the  number  of  affected  households \nand  the  nature  and  magnitude  of  impacts,  determine  compensation  rates  at  replacement  cost \nfor  all  categories  of  loss,  and  update  and  disclose  the  agreed  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  the \ntransmission  component.  After  the  detailed  design  of  the  distribution  component,  resettlement \nplanning  will  be  undertaken  and  an  RP  will  be  prepared  according  to  the  agreed  resettlement \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nframework (RF). The updated RP for the transmission component and the RP for the distribution \nsystem  will  be  agreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  disclosed  according  to  ADB\u2019s \npublic  communications  policy, 19 and  implemented  satisfactorily  according  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement.20 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nGoods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), and those financed by JBIC will be procured according \nto  JBIC  guidelines.  The  contracts  for  the  230  kV  substation  package  will  be  awarded  on  a \nturnkey  basis  through  international  competitive  bidding,  using  a  single-stage,  two-envelope \nprocedure. To expedite project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action \nfor the ADB-financed components. The Government has been advised that approval of advance \naction for procurement will not commit ADB to subsequently finance the Project. A procurement \nplan,  which  sets  forth  the  proposed  contracts,  method  of  procurement,  and  related  ADB \nprocedures, is shown in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nPICs  will  be  required  during  implementation  to  assist  EDC  in  project  engineering, \nprocurement,  supervision  of  installation  and  construction,  final  testing  and  commissioning, \nquality assurance, design and implementation of environmental management and resettlement \nplans,  and other  technical  inputs. About  40  person-months  of  international  consulting  services \nand  about  45  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  project \nsupervision. The terms of reference for the PICs are given in Appendix 8. \n\n43. \nPICs will be recruited through a firm by EDC, according to the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  (2006).  A  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection procedure will be used. The Government has been advised that approval of advance \naction for consulting services does not commit ADB to subsequently finance the Project.  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand EDC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n\n45. \nAttention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement and execution of contracts, and the sanctions imposed on those who violate these \nstandards.  Government  policy  and  experience  in  fighting  corruption  dictate  the  use  of  the \n                                                 \n19  ADB.  2005.  The  Public  Communications  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank:  Disclosure  and  Exchange  of \n\nInformation. Manila. \n\n20 ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n\ffollowing  preventive  measures:  (i)  a  procurement  committee  will  be  formed  to  supervise  the \nentire  procurement  process,  according  to  the  guidelines  prescribed  in  the  Government-\napproved Procurement Manual; and (ii) the Government will also cause EDC to initiate liaison \nmeetings every 6 months with the National Auditor Office to review and discuss information on \ncorrupt practices. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nADB  funds  under  the  proposed  project  will  be  disbursed  mainly  for  the  construction  of \n46. \nsubstations  and  for  PIC  services.  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  procedures  stated  in  the  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  will  be  followed.  An  imprest \naccount  will  be  used  for  local  expenditures.  At  the  start,  the  account  will  hold  the  amount  of \nestimated local expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, but no more than \n10%  of  the  loan  amount  (i.e.,  $2.0  million).  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated under the statement-of-expenditures procedure should not exceed $100,000. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n47. \nProgress  reports  for  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  EDC  and  submitted  to  ADB  every \nquarter.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical  progress,  procurement  and \ncontractual status, resettlement progress, and highlights of any implementation issues including \nthe  number  of  consumers  connected.  The  progress  reports  will  also  contain  a  summary  of \nproject  components,  including  details  on  the  latest  project  disbursements  for  incremental \nexpenditures  and  contract  amounts.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and \nJBIC within 3 months after the completion of the Project. \n\n48. \nEDC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of \nEDC\u2019s  fiscal  year  (31  December),  EDC  will  submit  audited  annual  project  accounts  (APA)  to \nADB, describing in detail the sources of funds and the expenditures made. In addition, EDC will \nsubmit  audited  corporate  financial  statements  (CFS)  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  fiscal \nyear,  including  statements  of  income  and  expenditures,  assets  and  liabilities  with  notes  to  the \naccounts, and cash flows. An auditor acceptable to ADB must audit EDC\u2019s CFS and APA, and \nthe audit report together with the memorandum on issues identified during the audit process will \nalso be attached to the respective reports (see details in Supplementary Appendix D: Financial \nManagement Assessment of EDC). \n\nAccording  to  current  practice,  EDC  will  continue  to  hire  external  auditors  to  audit  its \n49. \ncorporate  financial  statements  and  all  separate  project  accounts  including  resettlement \nexpenditures.  International  accounting  standards  will  be  followed  in  the  preparation  of  the \naccounts, and International Auditing Standards in the performance of the audit. The auditors will \nbe  required  to  provide  an  opinion  on  EDC\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Project\u2019s  financial  covenants \nand indicate the details of the actual calculations for all ratios as defined in the Loan and Project \nAgreements. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50. \nA number of measurable performance targets will be selected during the implementation \nstage, according to ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring and evaluation system. The number \nof  electricity  customers  and  demand  in  various  categories  will  be  monitored  using  EDC\u2019s \nconsumer database, with a separate category for poor consumers (i.e., those consuming up to \n50  kWh  of  electricity  a  month).  Efficiencies  in  utility  operations  will  be  measured  by  data  on \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fdistribution  losses,  energy  sales,  employee-customer  ratio,  and  average  cost  of  service.  The \ndegree  of  compliance  with  financial  covenants  will  provide  an  indication  of  EDC\u2019s  financial \nperformance  throughout  the  implementation  period.  The  monitoring  of  EDC\u2019s  Sihanoukville \nbranch  will  include  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  demand  management  and \nconsumer  services  component  of  the  Project.  Within  the  first  year  of  connections,  a  baseline \nsurvey  will  be  carried  out  by  EDC  to  monitor  connection  rates  of  householders,  electricity \nexpenditures,  and  other  relevant  indicators.  Two  years  after  the  baseline  survey,  an  impact \nsurvey will be carried out by EDC to monitor the Project\u2019s sustainability and development impact. \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nADB  will  review  the  Project  regularly  throughout  its  implementation.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment, ADB, and JBIC will also jointly undertake a detailed midterm review of the Project \nafter  2  years  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  appraise  the  project  scope,  cost \nestimates,  implementation  arrangements,  number  of  connections,  and  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants;  and  (ii)  identify  any  issues  to  be  addressed  to  improve  project  impact  and \nsustainability. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  the  potential  associated \n52. \nrisks. Adequate and reliable supply of power to industry and commercial consumers will enable \nthe sustainable development of these sectors and promote the socioeconomic development of \nthe southern region. The project benefits are increased revenues to the Government and EDC \nand  reduced  costs  to  consumers,  particularly  the  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  using \nprivate  generation  facilities  without  the  Project.  The  provision  of  firm-capacity  supply  would \nallow  existing  diesel  generators  to  be  decommissioned,  thus  reducing  greenhouse  gas  and \nother  air-polluting  emissions.  The  combined  benefits  and  positive  impacts  outweigh  the  costs, \nand net benefits will accrue to the project area. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  follows  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \n53. \nAnalysis  of Projects.  The  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  benefits  and  costs  with  and \nwithout  the  Project.  The  least-cost  analysis  minimizes  the  present  value  of  the  southern  grid \nexpansion  cost  between  2007  and  2035.  All  costs  are  expressed  in  world  prices  in  constant \n2005 dollars and discounted over 30 years using a discount factor of 12%. The base case for \nthe analysis is the with-project construction of the transmission line between Sihanoukville and \nKampot  in  2010.  Without  the  transmission  line  project,  the  feasible  least-cost  alternative  is  to \nadd  several  diesel  power  plants  in  Sihanoukville  to  meet  the  increasing  demand.  The  with-\nproject  scenario  would  result  in  lower  expansion  costs  than  for  the  alternative  without-project \nscenario. This shows that the Project is the least-cost option. \n\n54. \nThe financial capital costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \ncost of project inputs. The capital costs are classified into tradable goods and services, and non-\ntradable goods and services. The non-tradable goods and services are converted to the world \nprice  numeraire  using  a  standard  conversion  factor.  Costs  for  operating  and  maintaining  the \ntransmission  line  are  included  in  the  analysis.  The  project benefits  are  the  cost-savings  in  the \nsouthern transmission grid expansion between the with-project and the without-project scenario. \nThe calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 20.9 %. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fSensitivity and risk analyses have been undertaken for key risk variables to examine the \n55. \nrobustness  of  the  economic  results.  The  result  shows  that  the  Project  is  economically \nworthwhile even under combined extreme adverse conditions (Appendix 9). \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n56. \nThe financial benefits are essentially derived from the increase of electricity sales due to \nload growth, and from savings due to the lower price of energy purchased, and electricity loss \nreduction  in  the  Project  areas.  A  model  was  developed  to  forecast  the  trend  in  electricity \nconsumption  for  the  following  current  customers  of  EDC:  residential,  commercial  and  hotels, \nindustries, and government agencies. The model also includes the forecast of captive demand \nof large hotels and industries that are currently generating energy for their own consumption. \n\n57. \nA  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nFinancial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects.  The  following  projections  and \nassumptions were used: (i) the total system demand in the south is expected to reach 30 MW \nand  140  GWh  in  2010  and  52  MW  and  240  GWh  in  2014,  (ii)  annual  sales  will  grow  15%  on \naverage from 2006 to 2013, and (iii) average tariff will increase from KR666 in 2006 to KR718 in \n2013. Given these assumptions for the benefit and cost analyses, the post-tax evaluation of the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project was estimated at 13.3% in real terms. The \ndetailed financial analysis is shown in Appendix 10. \n\n58. \nSensitivity analysis indicated that the Project was robust for a potential decrease in load \ngrowth, increase in construction cost, increase in price of power purchases, and 2 years\u2019 delay \nin  completing  the  Project.  Overall,  the  Project  remains  financially  viable  under  the  various \nranges of scenarios. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B\u2013sensitive.  An  initial  environmental \n59. \nexamination  (IEE)  has  been  conducted.  The  IEE  assessed  the  likely  environmental  impact  of \nthe  proposed  project,  the  anticipated  significance  of  such  impact,  and  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  programs.  Special  attention  was  given  to  the  assessment  of  the \nproject  alignment,  which  may  traverse  the  buffer  zone  of  the  Bokor  National  Park.21 The  IEE \nprocess  also  included  extensive  public  consultations  with  stakeholders  from  the  local \ncommunities.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  project  will  have  insignificant  environmental  impact. \nThe IEE has been circulated to the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded onto the ADB Web \nsite in February 2006. \n\nEDC  is  committed  to  providing  adequate  staff  and  budget  resources  to  implement  the \n60. \nIEE,  during  project \nenvironmental  management  plan,  which  was  prepared \nimplementation  and  operation.  The  Government  will  ensure  special  care  and  adequate \ncoordination  during  the  construction  of  the  Project  within  or  adjacent  to  the  Bokor  National \nPark\u2019s buffer zone, to minimize its impact on the park.  \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n21 Around 20 km of the proposed transmission line route crosses the southern edge of the Bokor National Park buffer \nzone to avoid the greater net impact from the line that would result from crossing other sections of the coastal plain \nbetween  the  park  and  the  coastline.  The  main  impact  on  the  Park  will  be  the  loss  of  15  hectares  of \ndegraded/regrowth forest and the creation of modest visual impact. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nD. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n61. \nThe  social  analysis  undertaken  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  indicated  the  need  for  a \nshort  RP  for  the  230  kV  transmission  line  and  for  the  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville  substations \nbecause  fewer  than  200  persons  will  experience  major  impact.22 An  RP  has  been  prepared, \ntherefore, for the construction of the following: (i) the 78 km 230 kV double-circuit transmission \nline from Kampot to Sihanoukville, (ii) one 230 kV substation at Veal Renh, and (iii) one 230 kV \nsubstation  at  Sihanoukville.  The  230  kV  substation  at  Kampot  will  be  extended  within  the \nexisting site, and will not entail any land acquisition. For the 230 kV transmission line and two \nsubstations,  resettlement  planning  has  identified  731  households  that  will  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition.  Of  these,  it  is  anticipated  that  only  12  households  would  need  to  move  out  of  the \n30 m right-of-way (ROW): 7 could move back on their remaining land outside the ROW, and 5 \nwould relocate within their own villages. Fourteen households would also have to relocate their \ntemporary field huts on their remaining land outside the ROW. Only two households would lose \nland  to  the  two  new  substations.  Of  the  rest  of  the  700  or  so  households,  220  would  be \nmarginally affected by a loss of 100 m2 of land for the transmission line towers. A total of 3.92 \nhectares of land will be permanently acquired. It is also estimated that 3,000 trees would have \nto  be  removed  to  ensure  sufficient  vertical  clearance  for  the  230  kV  line.  Except  for  land \nrequired for towers, the land within the ROW can continue to be used for agriculture. \n\nLand acquisition may also be required for the 22 kV distribution system, but the location \n62. \nand  design  of  the  distribution  system  will  not  be  known  until  the  detailed  design  of  the \ntransmission line and substations is completed in the third year of the Project implementation. \nFor  the  distribution  system,  a  hybrid  loan23 approach  has  been  taken,  since  the  impact  area \ncannot  be  determined  before  appraisal,  because  of  the  undeveloped  stage  of  the  technical \ndesign.  The  distribution  system  will  require  building  poles  mainly  within  existing  road  ROWs, \nand  this  should  entail  only  minor  impact,  which  cannot  be  identified  until  after  the  detailed \ndesign of the 230 kV transmission line and substations is finalized. An RF has been prepared \nfor  the  distribution  system  to  guide  the  preparation  of  a  short  RP  during  loan  implementation. \nThe  summary  RP  and  RF  is  in  Appendix  11,  and  the  complete  RP  and  RF  are  attached  as \nsupplementary appendixes. \n\nSatisfactory  resettlement  planning  and  implementation,  to  mitigate  adverse  effects,  will \n63. \nbe  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  as  well  as  the  RP  and  RF \nadopted  for  the  Project.  The  impact  will  be  further  reduced  through  careful  location  of  the \ntransmission  line  alignment  and  towers  during  the  detailed  design.  A  gender  analysis  of  the \naffected  households  has  been  included  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix 12).  Compensation  for  all  lost  assets  will  be  provided  at  replacement  cost  and  at \ncurrent market value, and socioeconomic rehabilitation measures will be provided to ensure that \naffected  people  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as  they  would  have  been  without  the  Project.  The \ntheir \npoorest  affected  and  vulnerable  affected  people  will  be  assisted \nsocioeconomic status. \n\nimproving \n\nin \n\nE. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n64. \nThe social analysis indicates that most of the affected people are Khmer and that 2.4% \nare  of  Cham  descent  but  are  not  socioeconomically  more  vulnerable  than  the  Khmer  people \n\n                                                 \n22 Major impact involves the physical displacement of the affected people from housing or the loss of 10% or more of \n\ntheir productive income-generating assets, or both. \n\n23 ADB.  2003.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2/OP: Involuntary  Resettlement.  Manila  (29  October),  para.  40  defines \n\nhybrid loans and resettlement planning documentation. \n\n \n\n\fliving in the project area. The findings do not set off ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The \nsocial  and  gender  strategy  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (Appendix \n12)  includes  capacity  building  for  commune  leaders  (men  and  women)  and  members  from \nrelevant  agencies.  The  increased  capacity  of  the  commune  leaders  and  affected  people  will \nenable  the  effective  implementation  of  resettlement  and  livelihood  activities.  The  Project  will \nincrease  the  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  diseases \nbecause  of  the  influx  of  workers  during  construction.  This  potential  will  be  mitigated  or \nminimized through a program to increase awareness and provide preventive measures for the \nlocal communities and the workforce. \n\nF. \n\nRisks \n\nThe Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Tariff and connection charges may \n65. \nnot give large-scale consumers enough incentives to switch from their own generation sources \nto EDC\u2019s grid supply. By evacuating imported lower-priced power from Viet Nam, the Project will \nallow  EDC  to  maintain  lower  tariffs  than  would  have  been  the  case  without  the  Project.  In \naddition, the Government will carry out a tariff review to ensure that the tariffs and connection \ncharges are properly set.  \n\n66. \nEDC\u2019s weak financial performance, particularly the arrears from government agencies, is \na potential risk. Concrete and practical financial improvement measures have been developed \n(see details in Appendix 4) and will be closely monitored during project implementation.  \n\n67. \nAnother  potential  risk  is  the  generation  source,  i.e.,  whether  the  required  capacity  and \nenergy  available  will  be  provided.  EDC  has  entered  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  with \nElectricity of Viet Nam to ensure that 200 MW of power will be provided to Cambodia from 2008 \nonward. \n\n68. \nCompensation,  resettlement,  and  income-restoration  measures  might  not  be  delivered \nas agreed, thereby impoverishing the affected people and delaying the start of civil works. EDC \nwill  have  specialists  to  assist  in  preparing  and  implementing  the  RPs,  with  assistance  from \ninternational and national PIC consultants. The impact of resettlement will be further reduced by \ncareful location of the transmission line alignment and towers during detailed design. The PIC \nwill engage an independent monitoring organization for the duration of the resettlement activities. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\nFinancial  matters.  During  the  course  of  project  implementation  the  financial \ncovenants herein will be periodically reviewed and, unless otherwise agreed with \nADB, EDC will maintain the following financial covenants. \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nA  minimum  DSCR  of  1.3  will  be  achieved  in  FY2007  and  will  be \nmaintained thereafter.  \n\nA maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 will be maintained through 2010.  \n\nRevenue  breakeven  will  be  achieved  for  FY2007  and  maintained \nthereafter, such that total operating revenues are equivalent to or not less \nthan the sum of total operating expenses minus depreciation costs.  \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  total  accounts  receivable  of  EDC  will  be  maintained  at  a  level  that \ndoes  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  3  months  of  the  average  sales \nrevenues. \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate  sufficient  budget  to  offset  the  input  VAT \nowed by EDC to the Government\u2019s Customs and Tax Department. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  past-due  arrears  of  government \nagencies  with  EDC \nfull  by \n30 June 2007.  \n\nfor  FY2006  are  paid  or  credited \n\nin \n\nThe  Government  will  credit  or  directly  pay  to  EDC,  from  the  annual \nbudget  allocated  to  each  government  agency,  institution,  and  local \nauthority,  an  estimated  amount  for  each  entity\u2019s  expected  electricity \nconsumption for the coming fiscal year. \n\nEDC  will  maintain  its  transmission  and  distribution  system  losses  at  a \nlevel not exceeding 16% in FY2006 and thereafter. \n\nNo  later  than  3  months  prior  to  the  commencement  of  each  fiscal  year \nfrom  FY2007,  EDC  will  furnish  ADB  and  JBIC  with  a  draft  power \ndevelopment plan that sets forth the EDC power development plans and \ninvestment requirements for the next 10 years. \n\n(ii) \n\nOperational matters \n\n(iii) \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe Government will ensure that the Government\u2019s laws and regulations \nfor  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  are  followed.

If  there  is  a \ndiscrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements,  then  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  will \nprevail. \n\nfor \n\nthat  (i) \n\nEDC  will  ensure \nland  acquisition  and \nfunds  needed \nresettlement are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; (ii) the RP is \nupdated  and  submitted  to  ADB  after  the  detailed  measurement  surveys \nand  detailed  design  are  completed,  and  approved  by  ADB  before  it  is \nimplemented; (iii) the updated RP will be disclosed to all affected persons; \nand  (iv)  ADB  is  promptly  advised  of  any  changes  in  the  resettlement \nimpact,  and  if  necessary,  a  revised  RP  is  submitted  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence. \n\n\f(v) \n\nOthers \n\n(a) \n\nSocial issues. The Borrower will ensure that EDC includes the following \nconditions  in  the  civil  works  contract  documents:  (i)  mandatory  \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions; \n(ii)   requirements  that  the  contractor  comply  with  all  applicable  labor \nlaws;  (iii)  employment  targets  for  women;  (iv)  appropriate  child-care \nfacilities  in campsites  with  women  employees;  and  (v)  a  dissemination \ncampaign  or  campaigns, \nthrough  a  qualified  nongovernment \norganization  or  other  appropriate  body,  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), and on the risks of trafficking \nwomen  and  children,  to  those  employed  during  project  implementation \nand communities in the project area. \n\nBenefit  monitoring.  Within  the  first  year  of  electricity  connections,  a \nbaseline  survey  will  be  carried  out  by  EDC,  and  two  years  after  the \nbaseline survey an impact survey will be carried out by EDC to monitor \nthe Project\u2019s sustainability and development impact. The impact survey \nneeds  to  include  specific  indicators,  which  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation with ADB. \n\nAnticorruption. The Government will establish a procurement committee \nto supervise the procurement process, in accordance with the relevant \nADB  and  government  guidelines.  The  Procurement  Committee  will  be \nestablished by the first quarter of 2007 and chaired by a representative \nfrom  EDC.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  EDC  initiates  semiannual \nliaison meetings  with the Borrower\u2019s National Auditor Office in order to \nreview  and  discuss  information  with  regard  to  corrupt  practices.  The \nBorrower will ensure that all project staff fully know and comply with the \nBorrower\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nAs  a  condition  for  ADB  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  obtained  the \n70. \napproval  for  cofinancing  arrangement  from  JBIC  or  made  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB for the foreign currency funds, which are anticipated to be provided by JBIC.  \n\nA  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  in  a  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been \n\n71. \nduly executed and delivered on behalf of the Government and EDC. \n\n72. \nThe Government will submit to the National Assembly for approval an additional budget \nallocation  for  MEF  to  enable  MEF  to  offset  all  the  past-due  input  VAT  owed  by  EDC  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Customs  (about  KR43.5  billion)  and  Tax  Department  (KR19.7  billion)  as  of \n31 December 2005 and the estimated amount for FY2006. \n\n73. \nThe Government will submit to the National Assembly for approval an additional budget \nallocation for MEF to enable MEF to offset the arrears of the accounts receivable by EDC from \nthe Government\u2019s institutions, agencies, and local authorities, in an amount recorded by EDC at \napproximately KR22 billion as of 31 December 2005. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n74. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,519,000 to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n   LIQUN JIN \nVice President \n\n \n12 September 2006 \n \n \n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \n \nThe national power \ngrid in the region is \nextended, and \nprovides reliable, \nadequate, and \naffordable electricity. \n \nThe quality of power \nsupply in the \nsouthern region \nimproves. \n \n \nOutcome \n \nThe national \nbackbone 230 kV \npower grid and \nassociated \ndistribution facilities \nin the southern region \nare expanded and \nstrengthened, and  \nEDC\u2019s operation \nefficiency and \nperformance are \nimproved.  \n \n\n\u2022  Country economic and \npower sector analysis \nreports \n\n\u2022  Socioeconomic \n\nstatistics of provinces \nand districts \n\n\u2022  Project inception, \nprogress, and \ncompletion reports \n\u2022  Consultants\u2019 survey \n\nreports   \n\n\u2022  EDC annual report, \n\nfinancial statements, \nand project accounts \n\u2022  Project inception and \ncompletion reports \n\u2022 Project performance \n\nmonitoring and \nevaluation system \n\nFive years after project \ncompletion \n\u2022  Electrification ratio by \n\npopulation increases from \n17% in 2005 to 30% in \n2010  \n\n\u2022  The average tariff in the \nSihanoukville region is \nreduced from the current \n$0.13\u20130.2/kWh to \n0.08/kWh by 2010. \n\u2022  All towns and villages \n\nalong the transmission line \nhave access to the \nnational power grid. \n\nAfter project completion \n \n\u2022  There is an increase in \n\n230 kV transmission lines, \nsubstations, and \ndistribution facilities in \nproject area. \n\n\u2022  EDC energy sales and \n\nconsumption in the project \narea increase from 20 \nGWh to 45 GWh. \n\n\u2022  About 25,000 people are \nserved by the power grid. \n\n\u2022  EDC\u2019s financial ratios \n\ntargets are fully met, and \ndistribution loss is kept at \nless than 16%. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.  230 kV \ntransmission lines \nfrom Kampot to \nSihanoukville are fully \noperational. \n \n2.

The power supply system \nin  Cambodia  is  dispersed  and  isolated.  Except  for  Phnom  Penh  and  some  towns  near  the \nThailand  and  Viet  Nam  borders,  the  supply  typically  comprises  diesel  generators  and  the \nassociated distribution system. At present, only 17% of the population has access to electricity \nsupply,  and  electricity  consumption  was  estimated  to  be  55  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  capita  in \n2004, the lowest in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n\n2. \nThe provision of electricity in Cambodia is the responsibility of Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge \n(EDC),  a  government-owned  national  electricity  utility  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry, \nMines and Energy (MIME) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). As such, EDC is an \nautonomous  limited-liability  company  with  a  consolidated,  nonexclusive  license  from  the \nnational  regulator  to  provide  full  electricity  service  to  the  country  as  a  whole.  However,  at \npresent,  EDC  operates  only  the  isolated  systems  of  Phnom  Penh  and  five  other  provincial \ntowns,  namely,  Sihanoukville,  Siem  Reap,  Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  and  Takeo.  Before \nlong,  EDC  is  also  expected  to  take  over  operational  responsibility  for  seven  other  provincial \ntowns  now  under  the  responsibility  of  MIME  and  its  provincial  offices.  EDC  is  responsible  as \nwell for a number of areas where supply is provided by medium-voltage transmission lines from \nViet Nam. The rest of the country is supplied by independent power producers (IPPs) in larger \ntowns and rural electricity enterprises (REEs) in small villages and communes. \n\nWith  the  passage  of  the  Electricity  Law  in  2001,  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia \n3. \n(EAC)  was  created  as  an  independent  regulatory  body  mainly  responsible  for  licensing \noperators;  setting  tariffs,  rates,  and  charges  for  electric  power  services;  and  approving  and \nenforcing  appropriate  standards  for  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  electricity \nsystems.  \n\n4. \nAccording  to  the  Electricity  Law,  MIME  has  overall  responsibility  for  setting  and \nadministering  government  policies,  strategies,  and  plans  in  the  power  sector,  as  well  as \ngovernment decisions on such matters as (i) investments in the rehabilitation and development \nof the power sector, (ii) sector restructuring and private sector participation, (iii) promotion of the \nuse of indigenous energy resources, and (iv) planning and agreements on the export and import \nof electricity. \n\nB. \n\nPower Generation and Supply  \n\n5. \nIn the past 5 years, EDC has made tremendous strides in its operation, through the joint \nefforts  of  the  Government,  EDC  staff,  and  development  partners  like  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) and the World Bank. Electricity sales have more than doubled, and now grow about \n14% yearly on average. Assets have increased by about 50%. The installed generation capacity \nin the major provincial towns served by EDC in 2004 is summarized in Table A3 below. \n\nPhnom  Penh,  which  has  a  population  of  about  1  million,  has  the  only  relatively  large \n6. \npower  system  in  the  country  and  accounts  for  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  consumption. \nFollowing the commissioning of several generation projects and 115 kV transmission lines, and \nthe upgrading of distribution facilities, EDC has increased its generation capacity continuously. \nEDC\u2019s power system in Phnom Penh serves about 151,000 consumers with a peak demand of \n122 MW in 2004.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nThe  EDC  branch  in  Sihanoukville  operates  an  isolated  diesel-based  electricity  supply \n7. \nsystem serving about 8,000 consumers with sales of 20.7 GWh in 2004 and a peak demand of \n5 MW. The coverage of the distribution system is limited to the town, beach and port areas, and \nvicinity areas along National Road No. 4 toward Phnom Penh. \n\nTable A3: Installed Generating Capacity  \n \n\nLocation \n\nInstalled Capacity \n(MW) \n12 \n14 \n10 \n18 \n11 \n\nGeneration Plant \nEDC C2 \nEDC C3 \nEDC C5 \nEDC C6 \nEDC multiple units \nEDC multiple units \nEDC Russian units \n         Subtotal \nIPP-1 \nIPP Caterpillar \nIPP Kirirom Hydro \nIPP multiple units \nIPP Cummings \nIPP multiple units \nIPP Detroit Diesel \nIPP multiple units \n        Subtotal \n Total Capacity \n\nPhnom Penh \nPhnom Penh \nPhnom Penh \nPhnom Penh \nSihanoukville \nSiem Reap \nBattambang \n \nPhnom Penh \nPhnom Penh \nPhnom Penh \nSiem Reap \nBattambang \nKompong Cham \nKompong Cham \nTakeo \n                   \n  \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt.  \nSource: EDC. \n\n2.5 \n2.6 \n70.1 \n35 \n20 \n30 \n\n4.7 \n2.9 \n3.6 \n0.8 \n0.9 \n97.9 \n\n168 \n\nOwnership \n\nEDC \nEDC \nEDC \nEDC \nEDC \nEDC \nEDC \n \nCUPL \nJupiter Power \nCETIC \nNewland \nNewland \nGTS \nJupiter Power \nPrivate \n \n \n\nAn  ADB-financed  project  that  included  the  construction  of  a  new  5  MW  diesel  power \n8. \nplant  and  the  upgrading  of  the  distribution  system  for  EDC  Sihanoukville  was  completed  in \n1998. However, because of high growth in power demand,  the system is once again severely \nconstrained  by  a  shortage  of  generating  capacity.  EDC  is  negotiating  with  IPPs  to  purchase \nadditional power of around 5 MW to supplement its generation capacity.  \n\n9. \nThe  transmission  and  distribution  networks  in  Phnom  Penh  and  provincial  towns  have \nbeen  rehabilitated  and  reinforced,  and  are  being  further  expanded.  Distribution  losses  have \ntherefore been progressively reduced, from 25% in 1999 to 18% in  2004.  Power imports  from \nViet  Nam  at  reasonable  cost  have  begun  at  medium  voltage  level  in  the  border  areas.  Bulk \npower  purchase  agreements  at  high  voltage  level  from  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand  have  been \nsigned.  A  230  kV  transmission  line  project  from  the  Viet  Nam  border  to  Phnom  Penh  is  now \nbeing constructed with financing from ADB, World Bank, and Nordic Development Fund. Other \ntransmission and distribution projects are proposed and will begin around 2010. These projects \nwill allow EDC to import a large amount of energy at an acceptable low tariff from neighboring \ncountries to relieve the strain on domestic generation capacity.  \n\nC. \n\nSector Development Policies and Strategies   \n\n10. \nIn January 2005, MIME issued the Cambodia Energy Strategy, which included proposed \ndevelopment  policies  and  strategies  for  the  power  sector.  The  power  sector  development \nobjectives over the next 15 years are to develop an adequate and reliable electric power source \nand  a  national  power  supply  network  to  meet  the  growing  demand.  The  strategies  consist  of \n(ii)  establishing \n(i) increasing \n\ntransmission  projects, \n\nin  generation  and \n\ninvestment \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ninterconnections  with  neighboring  countries,  (iii)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  the \nsector,  (iv) commercializing  EDC  and  other  state-owned  enterprises,  (v)  encouraging  private \nsector participation, and (vi) promoting an increase in the provincial and rural electrification ratio \namong households to 70% by 2020.  \n\nThe  Power  Generation  Master  Plan  and  National  Transmission  System  Master  Plan \n11. \nwere  developed  in  2003  and  updated  yearly  thereafter.  Base  generation  projects  with  large \ninstalled capacity are planned for Sihanoukville, considering its independent access to imported \noil and the need to reduce the amount of oil transported on the Mekong River. Peak generation \nplants will be developed in Phnom Penh to meet the high growth in peak demand. Small- and \nmedium-sized diesel units will be constructed in the provincial towns as necessary. A least-cost \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  national  transmission  and  distribution  system  was  formulated  to \nachieve the overall sector development objectives.    \n\nD. \n\nKey Deficiencies and Challenges   \n\n12. \nThe  legal  and  policy  framework  for  the  power  sector  in  Cambodia  needs  to  be \nstrengthened.  The  lack  of  transparent  and  competitive  processes  in  IPP  project  development \nhas (i) raised electricity costs, (ii) created conflict with the optimum use of the transmission line, \nand (iii) discouraged private sector investment. With support from the World Bank and ADB, the \nGovernment is formulating and will adopt a private sector policy.  \n\nThe technical and financial health of the distribution subsector is critical to the future of \n13. \npower  supply  development  in  Cambodia.  However,  the  current  policy  framework  is  not \nconducive to the adequate development of the distribution subsector, and more active policies \nand measures encouraging private sector participation across all geographic areas of the power \nmarket are needed to give the population better access to electricity more rapidly. \n\n14.  With  the  support  of  major  funding  agencies  including  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  an \nenergy  sector  strategy  review  is  being  conducted.  The  review  includes  (i)  an  update  of  the \nsector development situation, (ii) an assessment of the performance of key sector players, (iii) a \nreview  of  crucial  issues  including  the  long-term  sector  development  strategic  framework,  and \n(iv) development of, and agreement with the Government, on strategic plans and priority actions \nfor  the  short  to  medium  term.  It  will  be  critical  for  the  Government  to  adopt  and  implement \neffectively the outputs of the strategic review.    \n\n15.  While  EDC\u2019s  financial  performance  has  improved  significantly  in  the  past  5  years,  it  is \nstill  very  weak  and  precarious,  mainly  because  of  (i)  escalating  costs  of  fuel  and  purchased \npower,  which  increased  by  24%  and  29%,  respectively,  from  FY2003  to  FY2005,  and  the \ninability of EDC to pass on these costs to consumers through tariffs; (ii) large payment arrears \nespecially from government agencies; and (iii) inability of EDC to pass on to consumers (in its \nelectricity  bills)  the  value-added  taxes  (VAT)  it  pays  on  its  power  purchases,  effectively \nsubsidizing consumers at its own expense. \n\n16. \nEDC continues to struggle with the high power generation costs, which are primarily due \nto  (i)  the  expensive  power  purchased  from  IPPs,  as  many  of  the  IPP  contracts  were  not \nawarded  through  competitive  bidding;  (ii)  the  small-scale  generation  capacity,  which  makes \nelectricity more expensive as economies of scale are not achieved; and (iii) the limited access to \nthe capital markets.  \n\n17. \nThe  limited  power  grid  coverage  and  unreliable  power  supply  have  led  many  large \nconsumers  to  continue  to  rely  on  in-house  generation,  with  its  low  efficiency  and  high  costs. \nMore investments in generation, transmission, and distribution projects by the Government and \nthe private sector, as well as external assistance, are highly required.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \nOF ELECTRICIT\u00c9 DU CAMBODGE \n\nA. \n\nGeneral Overview \n\n1. \nSince  its  creation  in  fiscal  year  1996,  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC)  has  gradually \nimproved  its  financial  performance.  Until  2005,  it  was  mostly  unable  to  make  a  profit,  mainly \nbecause  (i)  its  costs  and  revenues  are  very  sensitive  to  exchange  rate  and  fuel  price \nfluctuations;  (ii)  tariffs  could  not  cover  its  operational  costs;  (iii)  it  had  large  amounts  of \nreceivables  from  government  departments  and  local  authorities;  (iv)  its  dependence  on \nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs)  made  its  power  purchases  less  competitive;  and  (v)  its \ndistribution  losses  were  relatively  high.  However,  its  future  financial  performance  seems \nfavorable,  as  the  Government  and  EDC  have  been  vigorously  devising  remedial  measures  to \ndeal  with  the  problems.  The  more  significant  remedial  measures  include  (i)  adjusting  tariffs \naccording  to  fluctuations  in  fuel  prices  and  foreign  exchange  gain  or  loss,  (ii)  allowing  EDC  to \npurchase  from  a  wider  range  of  sources,  (iii)  settling  past-due  government  arrears  through \nbudget  allocation,  (iv)  converting  to  equity  some  loans  from  international  financiers,  and \n(v) continuously improving EDC\u2019s transmission and distribution systems to reduce losses.  \n\nB. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\n2. \nDespite  an  increase  in  energy  sales  from  320  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  in  2000  to  681 \nGWh in 2005 (14%\u201322% annual growth), EDC mostly continued to operate at a loss. Its net loss \nincreased  from  about  KR15  billion  in  2000  to  KR25  billion  in  2005.  Although  its  cash  flow \nimproved from about KR4 billion in 2000 to about KR40 billion in 2005, EDC\u2019s revenues could \nnot cover its operating expenses. EDC also faced difficulties in its debt service requirement, as \nthe ratios were mostly less than 1. Investments in EDC were not attractive, as its rates of return \nwere  below  2%.  Overall,  EDC\u2019s  previous  financial  performance  was  poor.  Details  of  EDC\u2019s \nfinancial performance and projections are presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\nPast Key Financial Issues  \n\nC. \n \nInsufficient  Tariff. EDC\u2019s weak financial performance was mainly due to low tariffs, as \n3. \nits main sources of income were insufficient to cover its costs. Tariffs in the last 5 years mostly \nfell short, except in 2001\u20132002. \n \nOutstanding  Government  Arrears.  EDC\u2019s  financial  performance  has  been  further \n4. \nadversely affected by the slow collection of accounts receivable from government departments \nand local authorities. EDC continued to struggle with the collection of government arrears and \ncompliance with the receivables covenant. Accounts receivable in 2004 totaled KR76 billion, of \nwhich  KR47  billion  represented  past-due  arrears  of  various  government  ministries  and \nagencies.  \n \n5. \nSensitivity to Exchange Rate and Fuel Price Fluctuations. More than 75% of EDC\u2019s \noperational  costs  were  dollar-based  because  EDC\u2019s  generation  was  almost  exclusively  based \non imported fuel and IPPs, both payable in dollars. Therefore, EDC was extremely sensitive to \nfuel  cost  and  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  The  riel  depreciated  from  $1:KR2,600  in  1995  to \n$1:KR3,800 in 2002 and about $1:KR4,000 in 2005. The steady increase in the price of crude \noil has also severely affected EDC\u2019s financial performance over the years. \n\n6. \nLess Competitive IPPs. As of 2003, about 45% of the EDC generation capacity system \nwas  provided  by  IPPs,  and  these  are  likely  to  continue  to  have  a  significant  role  in  providing \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\ngeneration in towns. The earlier IPP experience was not good, as purchased power prices were \nhigh  in  the  absence  of  competitive  selection  procedures.  EDC  had  had  little  experience  in \nnegotiating  these  contracts  and  had  allowed  itself  to  be  advised  by  the  investors  themselves \nand by lawyers acting in the investors\u2019 behalf.  \n\nDistribution Losses. Some networks suffered from power interruptions because of poor \n7. \nand  minimally  maintained  distribution  networks.  Although  EDC  has  continuously  improved  its \nsystems, the average losses were 25% in FY1999 and 11.5% in FY2005. \n\nD. \n\nCompliance with Financial Covenants  \nIn  the  first  ADB  loan  for  power  rehabilitation  project, 1  EDC  agreed  to  achieve  the \n8. \nfollowing  loan  covenants  (by  2000):  (i)  30%  minimum  self-financing  ratio  (SFR),  (ii)  1.3  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  (DSCR),  (iii)  accounts  receivable  not  exceeding  3  months  of  electricity \nsales,  and  (iv)  debt-to-equity  ratio  not  to  exceed  60:40.  The  principal  financial  covenants  for \nanother loan project2 focused on adjusting tariffs to achieve at least cash breakeven, improving \nDSCR to 1.2, and reducing the distribution losses to less than 17%. The progress and remedial \nmeasures under each covenant are as follows.  \n\n9. \nReduced  Government  Arrears.  The  Government  has  satisfactorily  complied  with  this \ncovenant. In FY2003, the Government took measures to address the long-standing issue in the \n2003 financial action plans by offsetting receivables against taxes and duties. The Government \nhas  increased  its  budget  allocation  for  electricity  payments  and  allocated  a  budget  for  settling \npast-due  arrears.  As  shown  in  Table  A4.1,  the  total  government  arrears  were  reduced  from \nKR47 billion in 2004 to KR28.8 billion by December 2005. By the end of that period, the amount \nowed  from  government  institutions  that  was  more  than  3  months  overdue  represented  only \naround  3  weeks  of  electricity  sales.  Furthermore,  MEF  agreed  to  implement  a  government \narrears  management  plan  focused  on  maintaining  total  accounts  receivable  at  3  months  of \nEDC\u2019s average sales.  \n\nTable A4.1: Aged Accounts Receivable, as of 31 March 2005  \n \n[THIS  INFORMATION  WAS  DEEMED  CONFIDENTIAL  ACCORDING  TO  EXCEPTION  #18 \nOF ADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY]. \n \n\n10. \nLower  Debt-to-Equity  Ratio.  EDC  has  satisfactorily  complied  with  this  covenant. \nDespite  cumulative  losses  of  KR87  billion  in  2002  and  KR146  billion  in  2004,  EDC\u2019s  financial \nperformance improved because of the Government\u2019s conversion to equity of the following funds: \n(i)  $25  million  of  the  ADB  loan,  (ii)  $15  million  from  the  Japanese-funded  Phnom  Penh \ndistribution  project,  and  (iii)  additional  contributions  of  about  $20  million  in  2002\u20132003.  The \ndebt-to-equity ratio improved from 58:42 in 1999 to 48:52 in 2005. \n\n11. \nReduced  Distribution  Losses.  EDC  has  fully  complied  with  the  distribution  losses \ncovenant,  as  such  losses  declined  from  25%  in  1999  to  11.5%  in  2005.  EDC  will  continue  to \n(i) identify  and  take  advantage  of  loss  reduction  opportunities  in  the  weakest  areas  of  the \nsystem, (ii) require industrial and big commercial customers to install capacitors to maintain the \nminimum power factors, (iii) set up vigilance squads to conduct surprise checks at costumers\u2019 \npremises  to  detect  energy  theft,  (iv)  introduce  energy  audit  systems,  and  (v)  implement \nincentive  schemes.  With  such  measures,  the  distribution  losses  are  expected  to  decrease \nfurther.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1994.

Manila (Loan 1794-CAM[SF]). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nHowever,  EDC  has  not  fully  complied  with  other  covenants  (breakeven,  DSCR  of  1.3, \n12. \nand SFR of 30%) mainly because of its substantial operating losses. EDC still cannot pass on \nthe  escalating  costs  of  fuel  and  purchased  power  to  consumers  through  tariffs.  However, \neffective  1  July  2005,  the  Government  has  rationalized  tariffs  by  (i)  introducing  an  automatic \nadjustment  to  the  cost  of  EDC\u2019s  power  purchases  in  dollar  terms,  such  that  the  revised  tariffs \napplied  to  industrial  and  commercial  (medium  and  large)  customers  were  linked  to  fuel  price \nfluctuations, foreign exchange gain or loss, and quantity of power purchased from various EDC \nsources; (ii) having one tariff level for industrial and commercial (small and medium) consumers; \nand (iii) rationalizing the lifeline tariffs, such that subsidized rates (at KR350/kWh) were charged \nfor consumption not exceeding 50 kWh/month.  \n\n13. \nRounds of tariff setting took place not only in Phnom Penh and immediate environs but \nalso in all EDC branches to improve EDC\u2019s overall financial performance. The Government also \nacted to rationalize electricity tariffs by changing subsidized tariff rates and applying automatic \nadjustments  to  the  tariff  applicable  to  small  commercial  and  industrial  consumers  in  Phnom \nPenh, Kandal, and Kampong Speu provinces. The new power tariffs, which effectively raise the \naverage tariffs of local residential, embassy and foreign residential, and government consumers \nby 11%, took effect on 1 November 2005. These adjustments will contribute to achieving a tariff \nsurplus, as targeted in Table A4.2. \n\nTable A4.2: EDC\u2019s Revenue Requirements and Tariffs, 2005\u20132010  \n(KR billion) \n2008 \n27 \n481 \n42 \n56 \n605 \n642 \n628 \n6 \n\nItem \nFuel Cost  \nPower Purchase \nOther Operating Costs \nDepreciation \nTotal Costs \nTotal Revenue  \nAverage Tariff \nTariff Surplus (%) \n\n2006 \n35 \n354 \n34 \n40 \n462 \n467 \n628 \n1 \n\n2007 \n21 \n424 \n34 \n49 \n528 \n539 \n628 \n2 \n\n2010 \n27 \n571 \n50 \n61 \n709 \n796 \n628 \n11 \n\n2009 \n27 \n525 \n46 \n59 \n656 \n718 \n628 \n9 \n\n2011 \n27 \n614 \n55 \n63 \n759 \n870 \n628 \n13 \n\n2012 \n27 \n664 \n60 \n66 \n816 \n955 \n629 \n15 \n\nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge estimates. \n\n14. \nEDC  did  not  achieve  the  cash  breakeven  targets  because  of  its  substantial  operating \nlosses.  EDC  continuously  struggled  with  the  collection  of  government  arrears,  as  several \nministries either had insufficient resources or assigned a low priority to the payment of electricity \nbills.  For  example,  total  consumption  for  FY2005  exceeded  the  KR67  billion  budgeted  by  the \nGovernment. In September 2003, the Government decided that input value added taxes (VAT) \nwould  be  a  subsidy  to  customers  with  the  Government  reimbursing  EDC  for  past  VAT \n(calculated  at  KR40  billion  from  FY2002).  EDC  and  MEF  are  preparing  a  detailed  time-bound \naction plan for potentially offsetting the reimbursement of VAT against the repayment of EDC\u2019s \nloans to MEF (about $15 million as of December 2005). \n\nE. \n\nEDC\u2019s Projected Financial Performance \n\n15. \nGiven  the  remedial  measures  discussed  in  paras.  10\u201314,  the  following  are  the  main \nassumptions regarding EDC\u2019s future financial performance: (i) sales will grow from 943 GWh in \n2006 to 2,181 GWh in 2012, for an average annual growth rate of 15%; (ii) average tariffs will \nincrease from KR666 in 2006 to KR711 in 2012; (iii) the share of power imported from Viet Nam \nin the total power generated will increase from 0% in 2006 to 49% in 2012; and (iv) the riel will \ndepreciate versus the US dollar from $1:KR4,126 in 2006 to $1:KR4,404 in 2012.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThese assumptions indicate that EDC will make a small profit of about KR4.9 billion in \n16. \n2006,  and  then  the  profit  will  grow  significantly  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  period.  There  will \nalso  be  significant  improvements  in  most  of  EDC\u2019s  financial  ratios  as  follows:  (i)  the  current \noperating ratio will always be higher than 1, indicating that cash flow is adequate to cover EDC\u2019s \nexpenses;  (ii)  rate  of  returns  will  also  be  more  than  12%,  indicating  that  investments  will  be \nprofitable; (iii) SFR, starting in 2010, will be more than 30%, indicating adequate self-financing \nfor  investments;  and  (iv)  DSCR  will  be  more  than  1.5  over  the  next  decade,  improving  EDC\u2019s \nability to repay its debts. \n\nF. \n\nProposed Financial Covenants  \n\n17.  With the Government\u2019s decision to adjust average tariffs and implement other remedial \nmeasures, EDC can look forward to a better financial performance by FY2007 and beyond. This \nwould allow EDC to continue operating more efficiently and comply with the agreed covenants. \nDuring project implementation these financial covenants shall be periodically reviewed. Unless it \nagrees otherwise with ADB, EDC will be expected to adhere to the following covenants: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nA DSCR of 1.3 shall be achieved by FY2007 and maintained thereafter.  \n\nA maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 shall be maintained up to 2010.  \n\nThe revenue breakeven shall be achieved for FY2007. This means that operating \nrevenues are equivalent to or not less than the sum of total operating expenses \nminus depreciation costs.  \n\nThe total accounts receivable of EDC shall be maintained at a level that does not \nexceed the equivalent of 3 months of the average sales revenues.  \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate  sufficient  budget  to  offset  the  input  VAT  owed  by \nEDC to the Government\u2019s Customs and Tax Department. \n\nThe Government will ensure that past-due arrears of government agencies with \nEDC for FY2006 are paid or credited in full by 30 June 2007. \n\n18. \nThe Government will credit or directly pay to EDC, from the annual budget allocated to \neach government agency, institution, and local authority, an estimated amount for each entity\u2019s \nexpected electricity consumption for the coming fiscal year. \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\nTable A5.1: Summary of Detailed Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nLocal \n\nTotal  Exchange  Base Costs \n\n($ million) \nForeign\n\n% Foreign \n\n% Total \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

The  Project\u2019s  economic  benefits \nconsist  of  cost  savings  from  the  grid  system  expansion  between  the  with-project  and  the \nwithout-project  scenarios  over  the  next  30  years.  The  economic  analysis  includes  an \nassessment  of  the  load  forecast,  a  least-cost  analysis,  and  a  valuation  of  project  costs  and \nbenefits, followed by an assessment of the project economic internal rate of return (EIRR). Risk \nand sensitivity analyses have been undertaken for key risk variables to examine the robustness \nof the economic results.  \n\nDemand Forecasts \n\n1. \n\nSouth Grid System Demand Forecasts \n\n2. \nThe  South  Electricity  Grid  (the  South  Grid)  consists  of  Phnom  Penh,  Kampong  Speu, \nTakeo,  Kampot,  and  Sihanoukville.  The  energy  demand  forecasts  updated  by  Electricit\u00e9  du \nCambodge (EDC) in June 2005 are shown in Table A9.1. \n \n\nTable A9.1: South Grid Energy Demand Forecast (GWh) \n \n\nTakeo\n\nKampot\n\nSihanoukville\n\nKampong Speu\n\nItem\nPhnom Penh\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n       \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n       \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n       \n    \n\n       \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       \n\n       \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       \n\n       \n        \n        \n        \n         \n    \n\n2010\n1,445\n5.9\n7.9\n6.7\n260\n1,726\n\n2005\n736\n3.0\n3.8\n3.9\n47\n794\n\n2011\n1,585\n6.6\n8.9\n7.4\n289\n1,897\n\n2006\n844\n3.6\n4.5\n4.5\n56\n913\n\n2007\n975\n4.2\n5.3\n5.0\n63\n1,053\n\n2009\n1,302\n5.3\n7.0\n6.1\n189\n1,509\n\n2008\n1,163\n4.7\n6.1\n5.6\n115\n1,294\nTotal\nSource: EDC, June 2005, (Sihanoukville: ADB estimates.) \n \n3. \nThese  cities  are  not  yet  connected  except  Phnom  Penh  and  Kampong  Speu.  In  2008, \nTakeo will be connected with Phnom Penh by a 230 kV interconnection line between Viet Nam \nand Phnom Penh and will be brought into the South Grid. In the same year, Kampot will also be \nconnected with Takeo and will be brought into the grid by a 230 kV transmission line under a \nproject  funded  by  German  development  cooperation  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW). \n \n\n2014\n2,118\n9.0\n12.5\n9.7\n378\n2,527\n\n2013\n1,921\n8.1\n11.2\n8.9\n348\n2,297\n\n2012\n1,740\n7.3\n10.0\n8.1\n318\n2,083\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n       \n    \n\n    \n        \n      \n        \n       \n    \n\n    \n        \n      \n        \n       \n    \n\n    \n        \n      \n        \n       \n    \n\n \n\n2. \n\nDemand Forecast for Sihanoukville \n\n4. \nFor  the  demand  forecast  for  Sihanoukville,  the  methodology  used  a  combination  of \nforecasts on the large consumer surveys and information on the Sihanoukville Growth Corridor \nDevelopment Plan. The load forecast for the city is divided into two parts: (i) the forecast for the \nEDC system, and (ii) the forecast for captive consumers that generate their own electricity.  \n\n5. \nFor the load forecast for the EDC system in Sihanoukville, estimates were developed to \nforecast  electricity  demand  for  four  sectors  between  2006  and  2035.  These  sectors  are \nresidential, commercial entities, small and large industry, and Government. The key parameters \nfor deriving the demand forecast for the EDC system are population growth, GDP growth, and \nconnection rates. The assumed population growth rate is 3.5%, which is higher than the national \naverage rate of 2.5%, because of the growth potential of Sihanoukville and surrounding areas. \nThe  GDP  growth  rate  adopted  for  the  region  is  4%,  which  again  is  higher  than  the  projected \nnational  average  rate  of  3.5%.  Income  elasticity  of  demand  was  calculated  for  residential \nconsumption  per  consumer.  Elasticity  of  1.21  was  obtained  on  the  basis  of  the  data.  Rates  of \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nconnection  to  each  district  in  Sihanoukville,  and  consumption  and  consumer  growth  rates \nadopted for the other sectors, are shown in Table A9.2. A detailed forecast was prepared up to \n2015 and projected to 2035 using the assumptions in Table A9.3.  \n \n\nTable A9.2: Energy Demand Forecast Assumptions for EDC System in Sihanoukville \n \nResidential Consumers Connection Rates\n\nMittakpheap\nPrey Nob\nSteung Hav\n\n51.6% in 2006, increasing 1% per year\n10.0% in 2006, increasing 3% per year for 4 years and 2% per year thereafter\n10.0% in 2006, increasing 3% per year for 4 years and 2% per year thereafter\n\nNos. of Consumers\n\nCommercial\nIndustrial \nGovernment\n\n9% of resident consumers\n10% p.a. growth for 2 years, reducing to 5% by 2013\nin line with population growth (3.5%)\n\nkWh/Consumer (% p.a. growth)\n\nCommercial\nIndustrial \nGovernment\n\n3.0\n6.0\n1.0\n\nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, kWh = kilowatt-hour, Nos. = number, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nTable A9.3: Sales Growth Rates of EDC System in Sihanoukville (%) (2016\u20132035) \n \n\nItem\n\n2016\u20132020 2021\u20132025 2026\u20132035\n\n \n\nResidential\nCommercial\nIndustry\nGovernment\n\n9.0\n8.0\n5.0\n3.5\n\n6.0\n5.0\n3.0\n3.5\n\nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n3.5\n\n \n\n \nThe  energy  demand  forecast  for  captive  consumers  in  Sihanoukville  includes  the \n6. \nfollowing  elements:  (i)  existing  major  industrial  consumers,  (ii)  international  tourist  hotels, \n(iii) Sihanoukville  port,  and  (iv)  the  planned  special  economic  zone  in  the  city.  The  forecast \nassumptions are shown in Table A9.4. \n\nC.  \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n7. \nThe  least-cost  analysis  minimizes  the  present  value  of  the  South  Grid  expansion  cost \nfrom  2007  to  2035.  All  values  are  expressed  in  world  prices  in  constant  2005  dollars  and \ndiscounted  over  30  years  using  a  discount  factor  of  12%.  The  analysis  has  the  following \nassumptions;  (i)  the  dispatching  power  would  be  provided  by  committed  independent  power \nproducers  (IPP)  and  committed  Viet Nam  imports,  followed  by  EDC\u2019s  diesel  power  plants  and \ndiesel oil fuel\u2013type gas power plants, and (iii) 10% reserve margin would be maintained. These \nEDC  power  plants  are  phased  such  that  they  would  meet  the  South  Grid  load  demand, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nminimizing the generation cost. The base case for the analysis is to construct the transmission \nline between Sihanoukville and Kampot in 2010.  \n\nTable A9.4: Load Forecast Assumptions for Captive Demand in Sihanoukville \n\nItem\nShoe factory\nBrewery\nTextile factory (1)\nTextile factory (2)\nGarment factories\nSeafood processing\nInternational hotel\nOther hotels\nSHV Port Autority\nSHV SEZ (1)\nSHV SEZ (2)\n\nAssumption\n5% per year from 2006 to 2009, then constant\n6% constant\n5% per year from 2006 to 2010, then constant\n5% per year from 2006 to 2009, then constant\n50% in 2006, then constant\n5% per year constant\n70% occupancy by 2006; 5 % per year from 2007 to 2008, then constant\none other similar development by 2006, 5% growth per year therafter\n40% per year from 2005 to 2009, then 15% per year thereafter\n200% in 2009, 67% in 2010, then constant\n100% in 2009, reducing to 14% by 2015\n\nSHV = Sihanoukville, SEZ = Special Economic Zone. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n8. \nWithout the transmission line project, the feasible least-cost alternative is to add several \ndiesel  power  plants  in  Sihanoukville  to  meet  the  increasing  demand.  It  is  assumed  that  the \nalternative represents the without-project case. The with-project scenario would result in lower \nsystem expansion costs compared with the alternative without-project scenario. This shows that \nthe transmission line is the least-cost option (Table A9.5). \n\nD.  \n\nValuation of Project Costs and Benefits \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Costs \n\n9.  \nThe financial capital costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \ncost of project inputs in terms of the world price numeraire. The capital costs are classified into \ntradable goods and services, and non-tradable goods and services. The cost of unskilled labor \nis  insignificant  in  total  cost,  and  no  shadow  wage  rate  factor  was  applied.  The  non-tradable \ngoods and services are converted to world price numeraire using a standard conversion factor \nof  0.9.  Classification  of  costs  is  based  on  the  engineering  estimate  (Table  A9.6).  The  costs, \nincluding  physical  contingencies  but  excluding  taxes,  duties,  and  price  contingency,  are \nestimated to be $45.2  million at constant 2005 prices. The costs of operating and maintaining \nthe  transmission  line  are  included  in  the  analysis;  these  costs  are  estimated  at  2.0%  of  the \ncapital cost yearly. \n\n2. \n\nProject Benefits  \n\nThe  project  benefits  are  the  cost  savings  resulting  from  the  South  Grid  System \n10.  \nexpansion  between  the  with-project  and  the  without-project  scenario.  For  the  without-project \ncase,  the  alternative  to  the  Project  is  to  construct  several  small  diesel  power  plants  in \nSihanoukville; this requires relatively high investment and operation costs. For the with-project \ncase,  the  Project  will  integrate  Sihanoukville  into  the  South  Grid,  and  lessen  the  total  system \nexpansion  cost,  since  the  large  South  Grid  power  plants  are  more  economical  than  the  city\u2019s \nsmaller plants.  \n\nE. \n\nProject Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n11. \nThe  project  period  of  analysis  is  30  years,  with  commissioning  in  2010.  The  Project \nyields  an  EIRR  of  20.9  %  for  the  base-case  scenario.  A  summary  of  costs  and  benefits  is \npresented in Table A9.5. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTable A9.5: The South Grid Expansion Costs \n($ million) \n\nCapital\nCost\n\nO&M

Project  viability  was  assessed  by  comparing  FIRR  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC). The sensitivity analysis, through sensitivity indicators, \nassesses the effects of likely changes in the key variables of the Project, such as demand, cost, \nand  revenues,  on  the  base-case  FIRR.  These  show  the  influence  of  these  variables  on  the \nviability of the Project. The switching values are used to determine those variables that are most \nlikely  to  affect  the  project  financial  performance.  The  following  paragraphs  explore  these \nassessments.  \n\nB. \n\nAssumptions of Project Benefits  \n\n2. \nThe  benefits  are  essentially  derived  from  the  increase  in  electricity  sales  due  to  load \ngrowth,  and  from  savings  due  to  electricity  loss  reduction  in  the  project  areas.  A  model  was \ndeveloped to forecast the trend in electricity consumption for the following current customers of \nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC): residential, commercial and hotels, industries, and government \nagencies. The model also includes a forecast of captive demand of large hotels and industries \nthat  now  generate  their  own  energy  needs.  For  financial  analysis,  we  have  adopted  the  load \nforecast in Cambodia, presented in the Economic Analysis (Appendix 9), as the scenario for the \nproject area (Sihanoukville), which is considered realistically achievable at prevailing tariff levels.  \n\n3. \nAn  analysis  of  the  demand  forecast  revealed  that  the  demand  would  exceed  EDC\u2019s \ngenerating capacity until the transmission and distribution lines are completed. The Project will \nhelp the large hotels and industries gain access to cheaper power, as EDC\u2019s tariffs for hotels, \ncommercial  entities,  and  industries  (Table  A10.1)  are  much  lower  than  the  costs  of  power \ngenerated by the private sector (Table A10.2). It is expected that these industries will gradually \nshift  to  EDC\u2019s  supply  since  the  transmission  line  from  Viet  Nam  to  Phnom  Penh  will  be  in \nservice by 2008, and the line from Takeo to Kampot, by 2009. \n \n\nCustomers  \nResidential \nGovernment \nHotel and commercial \nIndustrial \n\nTable A10.1: EDC Tariffs in Sihanoukville \n \nRiel/kWh \n720.00 \n760.00 \n740.00 \n670.00 \nEDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge. \n\n$/kWh \n0.178 \n0.188 \n0.183 \n0.166 \n\n \nTable A10.2: Costs of Energy Generated from Various Sources \n($/kWh) \n\nSources of Energy \n\nCost of energy imported from Viet Nam \nCost of energy from large diesel plant \nCost of energy from small diesel plant \nCost of energy from private diesel plant \n\n$/kWh = dollar per kilowatt-hour \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge, 2005. \n \n\nMarket Price \nincluding Taxes \n\nMarket Price \nexcluding Taxes \n\n0.0641 \n0.0888 \n0.1093 \n0.2082 \n\n0.0599 \n0.0868 \n0.1071 \n0.0776 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\n \n4. \nThe  benefits  from  the  incremental  sales  were  valued  in  terms  of  annual  average  tariff \nrevenue  and  the  demand  forecast  and  then  adjusted  to  constant  2005  price  levels.  The \ncomputations  for  each  category  of  customers  used  prevailing  tariff  rates  in  Sihanoukville,  as \nshown  in  Table  A10.1,  to  arrive  at  the  Project\u2019s  total  financial  benefits.  It  is  assumed  that  the \nrevenue flow for the Project will start in 2010, when the project construction will be completed, \nand end in 2036, in accordance with the economic life of the transmission and distribution lines.  \n\nC. \n\nProject Cost Assumptions \n\n5. \nThe total cost of the Project is not segregated by subproject, but was derived from the \ntotal  cost  of  the  Project  in  proportion  to  total sales.  The cost  of  energy  purchased is  the  main \nsource  of  the  project  costs.  It  is  more  than  60%  of  the  costs.  It  is  valued  at  either  the  cost  of \nenergy  imported  from  Viet  Nam  that  cannot  be  used  by  EDC  in  Phnom  Penh  (estimated  at \n$0.060/kWh),  and  the  additional  cost  of  energy  from  future  large  diesel  generating  plants  in \nPhnom Penh (estimated at $0.087/kWh). The generation costs of various power producers are \npresented in Table A10.2. \n \n6. \nThe capital cost of investment is about $47.3 million, derived from the total project costs \nafter  deducting  interest  during  construction  and  price  contingencies,  disbursed  from  2006  to \n2010.  The  main  costs  include  the  cost  of  the  transmission  lines  plus  the  associated  22  kV \ndistribution  lines,  both  comprising  equipment  and  civil  works.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement, \nand capacity-building costs are also included. \n \n7. \nThe  following  are  additional  costs  for  the  Project:  (i)  the  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts  of  the  transmission  line,  estimated  at  2%  of  the  capital  cost  of  the  line  per  year;  (ii)  the \noperation and maintenance cost of the distribution line in Sihanoukville, estimated at KR15/kWh; \n(iii) allowance for the capital cost of the distribution system in Sihanoukville required to meet the \nforecast demand, estimated at $0.114/kWh of incremental demand; and (iv) allowance for duties \nand taxes on the capital cost of the Project, plus the cost of imported fuel and other charges. \n \n8. \nThe analysis runs from 2006, when the transmission and distribution lines are assumed \nto  be  constructed,  until  2036,  when  the  lines  are  assumed  to  be  at  the  end  of  their  economic \nlives.  On  the  basis  of  the  above  assumptions  for  the  benefit  and  cost  analysis,  the  post-tax \nFIRR for the Project was estimated at 13.2% in real terms, as in Table A10.3. \n\nD. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nThe Project is funded by ADB, from its Asian Development Fund (ADF), Japan Bank for \n9. \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The cost of \ndebt  between  ADB  and  JBIC  is  assumed  to  be  the  same, with  the  following  terms:  (i)  interest \nrate of 1% per year will be applied; and (ii) MEF will relend the loan to EDC for a 20-year term, \nincluding  a  5-year  grace  period,  at  4.2%  interest.  EDC  will  allocate  an  annual  budget  as \ncounterpart funds, with the nominal cost of 20.6%. The tax-adjusted cost is the 9% corporate tax \nrate, the same for the three financiers, Table A10.4 presents the financial parameters used by \neach financier including the computation of WACC. The resulting WACC was 4.3%, lower than \nthe FIRR of the Project. This indicates that the Project is financially viable. \n\nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis and Switching Values \n\n10. \nA  risk  analysis  was  undertaken  to  examine  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  the \nfollowing  key  variables  on  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project:  (i)  a  20%  reduction  in  load \ngrowth/demand due to  potential economic recession or other factors; (ii) a  2-year  delay  in  the \nconstruction of the transmission line resulting in commissioning in 2013, as opposed to 2009 in \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nthe base scenario; (iii) an increase of 20% in the total construction cost of the Project; (iv) 30% \narrears in accounts receivable; (v) a 20% reduction in the commercial and industrial tariff rates \nonce  the  transmission  line  is  completed;  (vi)  a  combination  of  25%  arrears  in  accounts \nreceivable and 20% increase of power purchase price; and (vii) a combination of 20% increase \nin  construction  cost  and  20%  decrease  in  demand.  The  impact  of  these  changes  on  FIRR, \nsensitivity indicators, and the switching value is presented in Table A10.5. \n\nTable A10.3: Financial Analysis of the Project \n($ million) \n\nSales \nRevenue \n\nCost of \nEnergy \nPurchased \n0.0 \n\nTransmission \nO&M \n0.0 \n\nDistribution \nO&M \n0.0 \n\nDistribution \nCapital \nInvestment \n0.0 \n\nCapital \nInvestment \n\nTaxes \nand \nCharges \n\nTotal \nOutflows \n\n2009 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nYear \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n2021 \n\n2022 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\n2027 \n\n2028 \n\n2029 \n\n2030 \n\n2031 \n\n2032 \n\n2033 \n\n2034 \n\n2035 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n10.8 \n\n16.0 \n\n22.1 \n\n27.5 \n\n32.9 \n\n38.5 \n\n44.0 \n\n49.6 \n\n55.3 \n\n61.2 \n\n62.6 \n\n63.7 \n\n64.8 \n\n65.9 \n\n67.1 \n\n68.4 \n\n69.3 \n\n70.2 \n\n71.2 \n\n72.2 \n\n73.2 \n\n74.3 \n\n75.4 \n\n76.5 \n\n77.7 \n\n78.9 \n\n0.0 \n\n17.7 \n\n19.6 \n\n26.5 \n\n26.8 \n\n27.2 \n\n27.6 \n\n27.9 \n\n30.1 \n\n31.8 \n\n32.5 \n\n33.3 \n\n33.9 \n\n34.5 \n\n35.1 \n\n35.8 \n\n36.5 \n\n37.0 \n\n37.5 \n\n38.0 \n\n38.6 \n\n39.1 \n\n39.7 \n\n40.3 \n\n40.9 \n\n41.6 \n\n42.3 \n\n0.0 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.1 \n\n \n\n0.0 \n\n0.5 \n\n0.5 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.8 \n\n1.8 \n\n1.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n( ) = negative, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14.0 \n\n18.7 \n\n9.3 \n\n4.7 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n3.5 \n\n2.2 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.9 \n\nNet \nInflow \n\n(17.5) \n\n(20.9) \n\n(9.5) \n\n(14.5) \n\n(6.7) \n\n(8.0) \n\n(3.1) \n\n1.9 \n\n6.9 \n\n12.1 \n\n15.6 \n\n19.6 \n\n24.6 \n\n25.1 \n\n25.8 \n\n26.2 \n\n26.7 \n\n27.1 \n\n27.6 \n\n28.2 \n\n28.6 \n\n29.0 \n\n29.4 \n\n29.8 \n\n30.2 \n\n30.6 \n\n31.0 \n\n31.5 \n\n32.0 \n\n17.5 \n\n20.9 \n\n9.5 \n\n25.3 \n\n22.8 \n\n30.1 \n\n30.6 \n\n31.0 \n\n31.5 \n\n31.9 \n\n34.0 \n\n35.7 \n\n36.6 \n\n37.5 \n\n37.9 \n\n38.5 \n\n39.2 \n\n40.0 \n\n40.8 \n\n41.1 \n\n41.6 \n\n42.2 \n\n42.8 \n\n43.4 \n\n44.1 \n\n44.8 \n\n45.4 \n\n46.2 \n\n46.9 \n\n1.0 \nDiscount \nRate \n\nNPV \n\nFIRR \n\n5.8% \n\n         \n96.3  \n\n13.2% \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable A10.4: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) \n\nA.

For example, a 20% increase of the construction cost will reduce FIRR \nto  9.1%;  and  a  30%  increase  in  the  power  purchase  price  will  reduce  the  FIRR  to  8.2%.  The \n30%  arrears  in  accounts  receivable  will  reduce  the  FIRR  to  5.2%.  The  changes  in  these  key \nvariables will not adversely affect the Project, as those FIRRs are still above its WACC. \n \n13. \nThe Project, however, is sensitive to the combination of arrears in accounts receivable \nand  an  increase  in  power  purchase  price.  As  shown  in  Table  A10.6,  the  combination  of  an \nincrease  in  arrears  and  in  power  purchase  price  will  reduce  the  FIRR  to  4.3%,  equal  to  the \nWACC. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nThe sensitivity indicators indicate that the arrears in accounts receivable, the reduction in \n14. \nload growth, and the reduction in commercial and industrial tariffs are more sensitive than the \nadverse  changes  in  other  key  variables.  The  FIRRs  will  be  equal  to  the  WACC  of  the  Project \nunder  the  following  conditions:  (i)  load  growth  is  reduced  to  20.8%,  (ii)  construction  costs \nincrease by about 23%, (iii) arrears in accounts receivable reach 24%, and (iv) commercial and \nindustrial tariffs are reduced by 29%. But overall, the Project remains financially viable under the \nvarious ranges of scenarios for its sensitivity. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nA resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for the core project involving a 78 kilometer \n1. \n(km), 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Kampot and Sihanoukville and two substations \nat Veal Renh and Sihanoukville. The RP is based on agreed objectives, policies, screening, and \nplanning  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  the  laws  of  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia, \nprincipally the Land Law, revised in 2001, and the Electricity Law, 2001. \n\n2. \nA resettlement framework (RF) has also been prepared to guide the preparation of one \nor  more  subproject  RPs  for  the  proposed  medium-  and  low-voltage  distribution  systems.  For \nthese systems, little if any land acquisition impact will be caused by the erection of conventional \nmedium-voltage  22  kV  double-circuit  distribution  lines  in  Sihanoukville  connecting  the  230  kV \nsubstation and the existing 22 kV network, and 22 kV feeders from Sihanoukville and Veal Renh \nsubstations  serving  nearby  villages,  and  the  erection  of  22  kV  and  400  V  distribution  lines \nserving  the  villages  along  the  transmission  line  corridor,  as  poles  will  be  constructed  mainly \nalong existing road or rail rights-of-way (ROW). The alignment of the distribution systems will be \nmade in consultation with local communities, with the objective of avoiding or minimizing impact \nwherever possible. \n\n3. \nProvisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  RP  and  RF,  and  in  the  RPs  that  will  be \nprepared  subsequently,  will  supersede  the  provisions  of  relevant  legislation  in  force  in \nCambodia wherever they diverge. \n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact  \n\nthe \n\n4. \nThe  RP  for  the  transmission  line  and  substations  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  a \nfeasibility  study  using  line  locations  on  orthophoto  maps  (1997)  and  global  positioning  system \nlocation  surveys  of \ntransmission  alignment.  The  230  kV  Kampot-to-Sihanoukville \ntransmission  line  route  was  aligned  to  avoid  densely  populated  areas  and  minimize  the \nresettlement impact. The ROW will be cleared of all structures and trees above 3 meters (m), as \nuse of the ROW during operations will be restricted to crops and trees below this height. Only \n12  houses  (occupied  by  70  people)  and  26  structures  are  located  along  the  transmission  line \ncorridor;  of  the  12  houses,  5  will  be  moved  to  new  sites  within  the  village  and  7  to  property \nadjacent to the ROW and owned by the household. Some 14 temporary sheds on government \nland  in  the  buffer  zone  of  Bokor  National  Park  may  also  be  moved  outside  the  ROW  onto \nimmediately adjacent land. The Project will acquire 3.9 hectares (ha) of agricultural land for the \nestimated 222 transmission line towers (2.2 ha) and two substation sites (1.7 ha). A total of 731 \nhouseholds are likely to be affected by the ROW. An estimated 2,929 trees, consisting of 2,087 \nfruit  trees  (mainly  coconut  palm,  durian,  mango,  and  cashew)  and  842  non-fruit  trees  (mainly \nsandalwood and acacia), could also be affected. Some of these trees are in plantations held by \nnonresident  owners.  The  livelihood  impact  of  the  loss  of  trees  will  be  known  only  after  the \ncompletion of the detailed design and detailed measurement survey during implementation. No \nfarmers are expected to be severely affected by the loss of land. Compensation at replacement \ncost will be paid for land under the structures, and an easement fee of 15% of replacement cost \nfor other residential land not under structures. All land within the ROW that is not permanently \nacquired for towers will continue to be the property of the owner, but with restricted use. \n\nC. \n\nProject Resettlement Objectives, Principles, and Entitlement Policy  \n\n5. \nResettlement  Objectives.  The  RP  and  RF  aim  to  ensure  that  the  losses  incurred  by \naffected people are redressed such that affected people are assisted in developing their social \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nand economic potential to improve or at least restore their incomes and living standards to pre-\nproject levels, and they are not worse off than they would have been without the Project. \n\nResettlement  Principles.  The  above  objectives  will  be  accomplished  through  the \n\n6. \nfollowing resettlement principles adopted for the Project:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nfor  their \n\nlost  assets, \n\nAcquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people,  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative  project \ndesigns,  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and  engineering \nsolutions that have the least impact on populations in the project area. \nThe  populations  affected  by  the  Project  are  defined  as  those  that  may  stand  to \nlose,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  their  physical  and \nnonphysical assets, including homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial \nproperties,  tenancy,  income-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities, \nand  relationships,  as  well  as  other  losses  that  may  be  identified  during  the \nresettlement planning. \nAll affected persons (AP) identified in the project-affected areas as of the date of \nthe updated census and inventory of losses after detailed design will be entitled \nto  compensation \nincomes,  and  businesses  at  full \nreplacement  cost  and  provided  with  rehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist \nthem  in  improving  or  at  least  maintaining  their  pre-project  living  standards, \nincome-earning capacity, and production levels. \nAll  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible \nfor  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the \nobjectives outlined above. Those without legal title to land or structures occupied \nor  used  by  them  will  be  entitled  to  various  kinds  of  resettlement  assistance, \nprovided they have cultivated or otherwise occupied the land before the eligibility \ncutoff date. Resettlement assistance to non-titled APs will include compensation \nfor  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost  and  restoration  of  income  and  living \nstandards. \nThe  rehabilitation  measures  to  be  provided  are  (a)  cash  compensation  for \nhouses  and  other  structures  at  replacement  cost  of  materials  and  labor  without \ndeduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials;  (b)  full  title  to  replacement \nagricultural  land  for  land  of  equal  productive  capacity  acceptable  to  the  AP, \nincluding  the  cost  of  landfill  if  needed,  or,  at  the  informed  decision  of  the  AP, \ncash  equivalent  to  replacement  cost  at  the  current  market  value  for  buying  the \nsame;  (c)  full  title  to  replacement  residential  and  commercial  land  under \nstructures that must be displaced for safety clearance, replacement land of equal \nsize in the same village, acceptable to the AP, or, at the informed decision of the \nAP,  cash  for  replacement  land  at  replacement  cost  at  current  market  value  for \nbuying the same; (d) easement fee for residential land not under structures, to be \nvalued  at  15%  of  the  replacement  cost  of  the  residential  land  at  the  current \nmarket value for buying the same; (e) cash compensation for crops and trees at \nreplacement  cost,  including  compensation  for  a  minimum  of  5  years\u2019  lost \nproductivity for trees and perennial crops depending on the tree or crop variety, \nplus  provision  of  saplings,  fertilizer,  and  extension  assistance;  (f)  assistance  to \ntenants  paying  rent  on  houses  owned  by  others  by  way  of  3  months\u2019  rent \nallowance;  (g)  compensation  for  lost  business  and  wages;  (h)  relocation \nallowances  and  rehabilitation  assistance:  (i)  cost-of-living  allowance  for  all \nrelocating  households  and  severely  affected  farmers  in  cash  or  in  kind, \nequivalent  to  30  kg  of  rice  per  family  member  each  month  for  6  months; \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n(viii)  Adequate  arrangements  will  be  made \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nincorporated \n\n(j) relocation costs through cash payment of $20 per temporary field shelter, $40 \nper house relocated on the same plot, and $60 for houses relocated to another \nplot in the same village; and (k) priority access to project-related employment for \nAPs. \nfor \nSpecial  measures  have  been \ncomplementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  assist,  during  the \ntransition  period,  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  groups  such  as \nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  children,  and  elderly  people  without  support \nstructures,  people  living  in  extreme  poverty,  and  indigenous  and  ethnic \nminorities.  In  addition  to  other  entitlements  and  allowances,  all  poor  and \nvulnerable  APs  will  receive  a  cash  allowance  equivalent  to  30  kg  of  rice  per \nfamily  member  per  month  for  6  months  and  provided  with  any  other  necessary \nsupport to assist them in improving their socioeconomic status. \nThere  will  be  no  deduction  in  payments  for  salvage  value,  depreciation,  taxes, \nstamp duty, fees, or any other payments. \n\nthe  RP  and  RF \n\ninto \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\ntimely  conduct  of  social \nassessments,  inventory  of  affected  assets,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  RPs,  including  the  timely  conduct  of  internal \nand external monitoring of RP implementation. \nRPs  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  with  the  participation  of,  and  in \nconsultation with, affected people, and draft and final RPs are to be disclosed to \nAPs in a form and language that they can understand, in an accessible place. \nEnough  time  will  be  allowed  for  replacement  structures  to  be  built  before \nconstruction begins. \nTemporarily  affected  land  and  communal  infrastructure  will  be  restored  to  pre-\nproject conditions. \nAny  AP\u2019s  loss  due  to  any  acquisition  or  restriction  on  access  to  common \nresources  as  a  common  property  will  be  mitigated  by  arrangements  that  will \nensure,  as  a  first  option,  that  those  APs  will  have  continuing  access  to  an \nequivalent resource. If this option is not feasible, the alternatives will be identified \nin consultation with APs. \n\n(xiii)  The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures will be in place and all encumbrances on a contract area \nremoved before the Government and ADB approve the start of civil works for that \ncontract area. \n\n(xiv)  The Executing Agency will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to \nensure effective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of \nthe land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n\n(xv)  Cultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected  and,  as  far  as  practical, \n\npreserved. \n\n(xvi)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and will be made available to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within the \nagreed implementation period. \n\n(xvii)  Grievance  procedures  will  be  established  and  put  in  place  and  APs  will  be \n\ninformed of them before any resettlement activities begin. \n\n(xviii)  Details  of  the  RP  will  be  distributed  to  the  APs  and  placed  in  project  and \ncommune  offices  for  the  reference  of  affected  people,  as  well  any  interested \ngroups. \n\n(xix)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system and an external \nmonitor hired before the start of any resettlement activities.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  project  entitlements  (detailed  in  the  Entitlement  Matrix  in  the  Supplementary \n7. \nAppendix) are designed to cover compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets; \nand to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all APs. APs will receive compensation in cash or in \nkind  (e.g.,  replacement  land)  at  replacement  cost  for  affected  assets,  as  well  as  various \nrehabilitation measures. \n\nD. \n\nConsultation, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure  \n\n8. \nAPs  and  commune  leaders  were  consulted  during  project  preparation  to  discuss  the \nresettlement impact, availability of replacement land, replacement costs for all categories of lost \nassets,  and  rehabilitation  measures  and  assistance  to  ensure  that  APs  can  restore,  if  not \nimprove, their livelihoods. Further consultation will be carried out before the design is finalized, \nand will continue during RP updating, preparation, and implementation. A three-step procedure \nwill be established to deal with any resettlement-related issues, concerns, or grievances raised \nduring  project  implementation  and  based  on  preparation  and  approval  of  the  RP.  APs  will  be \nexempted from administrative fees associated with resolving the grievances. \n\nA  public  information  booklet  was  prepared  and  distributed  to  all  APs  before  appraisal \n9. \nand discussed during commune meetings. Copies of the final translated RP will be placed in the \nrespective  district  and  commune  offices.  The  final  version  of  the  agreed  and  updated  RP  will \nalso be uploaded onto ADB\u2019s Web site. The updated RP and subproject RPs prepared during \nproject  implementation  will  be  disclosed  to  APs  before  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval; disclosure will include the presentation of the updated public information booklet with \ncompensation unit rates, and discussion in commune meetings. Final RPs and updated RPs will \nalso be disclosed to APs in district and commune offices. \n\nE. \n\nGender, Ethnicity, and Poverty Issues  \n\n10.  Women, ethnic minorities, and poor households are among the most vulnerable groups \naffected  by  resettlement.  The  socioeconomic  survey  identified  37%  of  the  sampled  population \nas  being  below  the  poverty  line  or  otherwise  vulnerable,  including  4.7%  female-headed \nhouseholds  and  7.0%  households  who  were  elderly  without  support  or  disabled.  However, \nvulnerable  households  were  not  found  within  the  households  that  might  consist  of  project-\naffected people according to the present level of design. In much of the 230 kV transmission line \nproject  area,  the  number  and  proportion  of  poor  households  is  indicated  to  be  negligible  or \nminor.  This  situation  will  be  reassessed  after  the  detailed  design  and  detailed  measurement \nsurvey.  Resettlement  planning  and  implementation  will  pay  special  attention  to  (i)  the  role  of \nwomen\u2019s  economic  activities  in  restoring  living  standards;  (ii)  access  to  credit  and  agricultural \nextension for women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; (iii) joint registration of any land-\nuse  rights  in  the  names  of  both  husband  and  wife  where  households are  allocated  alternative \nagricultural or residential land; (iv) participation and consultation strategies that encourage the \ninvolvement  of  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation;  (v)  complaints  and  grievances  lodged  by  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor \nhouseholds; and (vi) collection of data disaggregated by gender and ethnic minority to support \nresettlement planning and monitoring. A gender strategy has been prepared for the Project and \nis  included  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (Appendix  12).  A  national \nconsultant  on  gender  and  development  will  be  among  the  consultants  who  will  assist  in \ndeveloping  the  gender  strategy  into  an  implementation  plan.  Capacity-building  training  will  be \nprovided  to  men  and  women  commune  leaders  and  AP  households  to  make  resettlement \nplanning and implementation more effective. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule  \n\n11. \nElectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC),  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  appoint  a  full-time \nresettlement staff to coordinate closely with the involved ministries and other agencies, as well \nas  reassess  the  actual  compensation  needs.  It  will  ensure,  through  its  project  management \norganization  (PMO),  that  provincial  and  district  resettlement  committee  authorities  are \nappointed.  The  PMO  has  been  established  in  Phnom  Penh  and  the  appointed  authorities  will \noperate  under  the  direction  of  the  provincial  governors  of  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville.  In \ncoordination with these relevant agencies, the PMO will manage and supervise the project and \nwill  create  a  social  and  environment  unit  (SEU),  and  will  assign  appropriate  qualified \nresettlement staff for the periods necessary, with responsibility for social issues, particularly (i) \nresettlement  planning  and  management,  (ii) HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  (iii)  poverty  and \nsocial  impact  assessments,  and  (iv)  labor  practices.  EDC  will  hire  at  least  one  new  full-time \nresettlement  staff  who  is  a  recent  social  science  graduate,  to  be  trained  on  the  job  by  project \nconsultants. \n\n12. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years  starting  in  2006.  The  implementation  of \nresettlement and related activities will take place after the mobilization of the project supervision \nconsultant, who will work closely with, and assist, the PMO in all resettlement-related activities. \nCivil  works  contractors  will  not  be  issued  a  notice  of  possession  of  site  for  any  section  of  the \nconstruction works unless the PMO has (i) completed, in accordance with the approved relevant \nRP  for  the  230  kV  main  transmission  line  or  any  subproject,  compensation  payment  and \nrelocation  to  new  sites;  and  (ii)  ensured  that  the  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place,  and  the \narea required for civil works is free of encumbrances.  \n\nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n13. \nThe implementing agencies (PMO and provincial resettlement committees) will conduct \nregular internal monitoring of the RP implementation. The PMO will submit quarterly monitoring \nreports  to  ADB.  Also,  the  PMO  will  engage  an  independent  monitoring  organization  (IMO)  to \nconduct  external  scheduled  monitoring  and  evaluation,  focusing  on  the  social  impact  of  the \nproject  and  the  ability  of  APs  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project  living  standards, \nincomes, and productive capacity. A post-project evaluation study will also be carried out by the \nIMO approximately 1 year after the main 230 KV transmission line is completed. \n\nH. \n\nResettlement Budget and Flow of Funds \n\nThe Project has budgeted $1 million for land acquisition and resettlement program costs, \n14. \nto  be  financed  from  counterpart  funds.  The  budget  includes  compensation  payments  and \nallowances to APs, relocation costs, mitigation and income restoration measures, administrative \ncosts,  and  20%  for  contingencies.  The  budget  for  the  transmission  line  and  substation  core \nproject is estimated to be $648,000, and another $160,000 (25% of the transmission component \nresettlement costs) is budgeted for the distribution component, which is considered sufficient to \ncover  the  marginal  impact  anticipated.  The  Inter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee  will  be \nresponsible for providing funds to the provincial resettlement committees for compensation for \nland acquisition and resettlement, including payments to APs directly for land, crops, and trees \nincluding houses, other structures, and any allowances. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n    No \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nThe  population  of  Cambodia  is  about  13  million,  of  whom  about  one  third  live  in  poverty.  The  country\u2019s \ninfrastructure was destroyed significantly during decades of civil  war and conflict, and its socioeconomic \nindicators are considered relatively lower than those of other countries in the region. Poverty in Cambodia \nis overwhelmingly rural, from a low of 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh, to 40\u201345% in rural areas. The incidence of \npoverty declined only modestly over the last several years. This is due to a range of factors, including the \nshortage of sources of growth, backward linkages to the domestic economy, and the exclusion of the poor \nfrom the mainstream economy. For the economy to develop, the basic structure must improve. \n\nThe  power  sector  in  Cambodia  is  both  small  and  highly  fragmented,  with  24  isolated  power  systems \ncentered on the various provincial cities and the capital, Phnom Penh. About 85% of the population lives in \nthe  rural  areas  and  most  do  not  have  access  to  electricity.  Nationwide,  less  than  17%  of  the  population \nhas access to electricity supply. Electricity consumption per capita is estimated to be 55 kWh in 2004, one \nof  the  lowest  in  the  region.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  an  integrated  high-voltage  transmission  system  and \ninterconnections to adjacent countries and the high cost of imported diesel fuel have resulted in electricity \nproduction that is among the world\u2019s costliest. Since Cambodia has limited indigenous energy sources that \nhave  been  explored  so  far,  it  relies  primarily  on  expensive  diesel  generation.  The  lack  of  adequate  and \naffordable  electricity  supply  is  identified  as  one  of  the  main  constraints  on  economic  growth.  Given  the \nimportant  role  of  electricity  in  providing  power  for  economic  growth,  this  constraint,  if  not  removed,  will \nsignificantly  limit  economic  growth  and  hinder  the  country\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investments  and  economic \nactivities. \n\nDespite  its  weak  infrastructure,  Cambodia  has  started  its  process  of  rehabilitation  with  support  from \ndevelopment partners. Power demand has increased significantly, with an annual growth rate of 12% on \naverage from 2000 to 2004. Increasing access to electricity, especially in provincial and rural areas, is a \nkey  factor  in  the  development  of  those  areas.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment gives priority to national power grid expansion in underserved areas. Given that the power \nsector plays a key role in economic growth and social development, Asian Development Bank\u2019s approach \nis to help the Government achieve its development objective.  \n\nSihanoukville,  Cambodia\u2019s  only  deep-water  port,  is  a  fast-growing  city  with  major  ongoing  projects  to \nexpand the port facilities. The Government is developing Sihanoukville as an export processing zone and \nexpanding its international tourist industry. But currently there is no grid connection between Sihanoukville \nand  the  national  main  grid.  The  proposed  Project  will  extend  the  transmission  line  from  Kampot  to \nSihanoukville.  The  extension  of  the  transmission  line  to  Sihanoukville  will  promote  the  provision  of \nsustainable  and  reliable  electricity  supply  at  affordable  prices  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential \nconsumers in Sihanoukville and vicinity areas along the transmission corridor.  \n\nA  reliable  supply  of  electricity  is  important  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Electricity  supply \npromotes  alternative  sources  of  income  that  makes  households  less  likely  to  fall  below  the  poverty  line. \nAccess  to  electricity  has  expenditure-reducing  effects,  which  are  particularly  important  for  poor \nhouseholds. Reduced expenditure on electricity allows households to spend more on food, education, and \nhealth services.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project is classified as a general intervention; therefore, according to the revised poverty guidelines, \nno poverty analysis is required. The resettlement plan (RP) includes measures for the affected people. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nConsultations regarding land acquisition and resettlement issues were undertaken with key government \nofficials and the affected people. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThere  is  a  strategy  for  further  disclosure  of  the  RP  to  affected  people,  who  will  be  consulted  and  will \nparticipate  in  RP  updating  and  implementation  and  monitoring.  To  increase  the  participation  of  various \nstakeholders,  the  Project  includes  capacity-building  training  for  the  affected  people,  commune  leaders, \nand  relevant  government  department  and  implementing  agencies.  Access  to  information  and  increased \nknowledge through capacity-building training would enable the affected households and commune leaders \nto participate effectively in consultations preceding resettlement activities and in compensation planning. \nThe  gender  sensitization  training  would  increase  awareness  among  the  implementing  agencies  of  the \nneed  to  create  opportunities  for  participation  among  men  and  women  from  the  affected  households,  as \nwell as men and women commune leaders, in resettlement and livelihood activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nRP  preparation,  updating,  and  implementation  will  pay  special  attention  to  (i)  the  role  of  women\u2019s \neconomic activities in restoring living standards; (ii) access to credit and agricultural extension for women, \nethnic minorities, and poor households; (iii) joint registration of any land-use rights in the names of both \nhusband  and  wife  where  households  are  allocated  alternative  agricultural  or  residential \nland; \n(iv) participation and consultation strategies that encourage the involvement of women, ethnic minorities, \nand poor households in resettlement planning and implementation; (v) complaints and grievances lodged \nby  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households;  and  (vi)  collection  of  data  disaggregated  by  gender \nand ethnic minority to support resettlement planning and monitoring.  \n \nThere  is  increased  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  to  the  project  communities  because  of  the  influx  of  construction \nworkers. An HIV/AIDS awareness program for the communities will be developed and implemented during \nproject  implementation  Construction  contracts  will  include  a  budgeted  line  item  requiring  contractors  to \nprovide awareness and prevention programs for their workers. \n\n \nGender strategy: \n \n(i) \n\nAt the start of the Project, a capacity-building training program will be designed for the women \nvillage  leaders  from  the  affected  communes.  The  participants  will  also  include  male  commune \nleaders and representatives of mass organizations. The awareness and leadership skills training \nwill enhance women\u2019s participation at the commune level in resettlement-related discussions.  \nThe  provincial  and  district  resettlement  working  groups  will  include  women  representing  the \ninterests  of  women  and  female-headed  affected  households.  At  the  commune  level,  specific \nresettlement  committees  will  be  formed  to  participate  in  RP  planning  and  implementation. \nSpecific strategies will be developed to encourage women and poor households to participate in \nresettlement planning and implementation and monitoring. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(iii)  During  the  Detailed  Measurement  Survey,  men  and  women  from  the  affected  households  will \nparticipate  in  the  discussion  of  inventory  and  detailed  measurement  of  losses.  At  the  village, \nhamlet, and commune discussions for the preparation and implementation of the RPs, separate \nmeetings  will  be  held  with  the  women  from  the  affected  households  and  female-headed \nhouseholds  to  determine  (a)  the  impact  on  the  productive  land  and  loss  of  other  productive \nassets  and  income,  (b)  problems  related  to  relocation  of  houses,  and  (c)  the  additional \nmeasures  or  specific  assistance  required  to  address  the  needs  of  the  households  headed  by \nwomen and women from the affected households. \n\n(iv)  Resettlement working groups and commune leaders will consult separately with the households \nheaded  by  women  and  women  from  households  severely  affected  by  displacement  and  those \naffected by the loss of 10% or more of productive assets to identify the assistance required in \nterms of selection of sites for productive land, extension services, training, and capital support to \nrestore their livelihood. \n\n(v)  Specific attention will be paid to (a) restoring the economic activities of the women affected by \nthe  loss  of  productive  trees  and  garden  land;  (b)  providing  them  with  access  to  agricultural \nextension assistance, training, and financial services; and (c) establishing links with a marketing \nfacility and relevant technical assistance, as required. \n\n(vi)  The RP will include joint registration of land-use rights in the names of both husband and wife in \n\ninstances where households are allocated alternative agriculture or residential land. \n(vii)  Attention will be paid to complaints and grievances made by women and poor households. \n(viii)  The  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  involve  the  women,  youth,  health \n\nworkers, and women community leaders. \n\n(ix)  Women,  as  well  as  men  from  severely  affected  poor  households,  will  be  prioritized  for \n\nemployment-related civil works for the transmission lines and substations. \n\n(x)  According  to  the  Labor  Code  (1997)  all  employment  for  the  Project  will  respect  government \ncommitments  to  gender  equity  including  (a)  employment  targets  for  women,  (b)  prohibitions \nagainst the use of child labor or trafficked labor, (c) nondiscrimination against the employment of \nqualified  women,  and  (d)  nondiscrimination  in  the  payment  of  wages  or  benefits  to  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value. \n\n(xi)  Monitoring  indicators  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnic  group  will  be  developed  for  the \n\nmanagement information system. \n\n(xii)  Gender  sensitization  training  will  be  held  for  relevant  staff  from  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  and \nInter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee,  members  of  the  provincial,  district  resettlement \nworking groups, commune leaders, and the independent monitoring agency. \n\n(xiii)  A  national  consultant  on  gender  and  development  will  provide  consulting  assistance  in \ndeveloping  the  gender  strategy  into  an  implementation  plan.  Capacity-building  training  will \ninclude men and women commune leaders, men and women leaders from the AP households, \nand  district-level  women  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs.  The  capacity-building \ntraining will focus on (a) information on effective consultation, RP activities, compensation, and \nlivelihood  activities,  to  increase  knowledge  about  resettlement  planning,  compensation,  and \nimplementation;  (b)  information  and  linkages  with  poverty  and  rural  development  programs \nsupported  by  funding  agencies,  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations,  so  that  the \naffected  people  can  get  access  to  these  programs;  and  (c)  impact  of  the  project  on  livelihood \nfrom productive trees. \n\n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n \nA gender strategy has been prepared (see above). \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\n \nE.

ADB's \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  is  therefore  not \ntriggered. The RP pays special attention to ethnic \nminority issues. \nThere  is  a  risk  that  the  displaced  might  not  fully \nrestore  their  livelihood.  The  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds might become more vulnerable during \nrelocation  and  land  acquisition.  During  project \nconstruction, temporary labor camps can increase \ndemand  for  sex  workers  for  the  construction \nworkers,  and  thus  increase  the  potential  for \ntrafficking  of  girls  and  women \nthe \nsurrounding  communities.
