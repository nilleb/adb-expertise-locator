It  will  enhance  trade  between  Yunnan  Pu\u2019er  and  neighboring  countries  by \n(i) upgrading  regional  roads  serving  national  borders;  (ii) improving  roads,  road  maintenance, \nand public transport services in rural areas; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity.2 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nYunnan  Province,  located  in  southwest  PRC,  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  least  developed \nprovinces.  Due  to  road  network  limitations  the  rural  population  suffers  from  lack  of  access  to \nmarkets and economic opportunities. High transport costs limit the extent of regional trade and \nconstrain residents\u2019 income-earning potential. With better road connections, Yunnan could serve \nas a gateway for transport and trade with neighboring countries.  \n \n4. \nPu\u2019er is a mountainous prefecture in southern Yunnan with a land area of 45,385 square \nkilometers  (12%  of  Yunnan\u2019s  total).  Bordering  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR), \nMyanmar,  and  Viet  Nam,  it  had  a  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  of  CNY11,795  in  2011, \n62% of the Yunnan average and about half the national average. Rural gross domestic product \nper capita was one-third of the prefecture average (CNY4,338). Of 2.56 million inhabitants (5% \nof  Yunnan\u2019s  total),  950,000  were  below  the  government\u2019s  official  poverty  line,3 representing  a \n37.1% poverty rate, with all nine counties designated as national poverty counties.4 \n \n5. \nRoad transport is the dominant transport mode in Pu\u2019er. It is an important enabling factor \nin economic  development  and  poverty reduction. In  2011,  total transport  in Pu\u2019er  amounted  to \n3.8  billion  ton  kilometers  and  2.8  billion  passenger  kilometers,5 mostly  carried  by  road.6 Pu\u2019er \nhas  615,900  registered  vehicles,7 and  73  transport  service  enterprises  employing  over  11,000 \npeople. \n \n6. \nThe road network in Pu\u2019er has a total length of 19,424 kilometer (km), comprising 2,504 \nkm  of  national  and  provincial  roads  and  16,291  km  of  county,  township,  village,  and  special \nroads. The proportion of unclassified roads in Pu\u2019er (34%) is relatively high compared with the \nYunnan average  (23%), and although the  proportion  of  unpaved roads  is  similar to the  rest of \n                                                                                       \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Yunnan  Pu\u2019er \n\nRegional Integrated Road Network Development Project (TA 8149).  \n\n3  Defined as an annual income of below CNY2,300. \n4  A national poverty county designation represents an average rural per capita net income of less than CNY2,300. \n5  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  Statistical  Bureau  of  Yunnan  Province.  2012.  Yunnan  Statistical \n\nYearbook. Kunming. \n\n6  Water  transport  in  Pu\u2019er  for  2011  involved  600,000  passengers  (6%  of  Yunnan\u2019s  total)  and  160,000  tons  (3%  of \nYunnan\u2019s  total).  In  2009,  water  transport  serviced  less  than  1%  of  total  passenger-kilometers  and  freight  ton-\nkilometers.  There  are  no  railways  in  Pu\u2019er.

Kunming. \n\n\fthe province, a larger percentage of these are earthen roads (about 34% of the network in Pu\u2019er \ncompared with 20% for Yunnan Province). \n \n7. \nThe Yunnan Highway Administration Bureau is responsible for administering most of the \nnational  and  provincial  roads  in  Pu\u2019er  prefecture. 8  The  Pu\u2019er  Municipal  Transport  Bureau \n(PMTB)  administers  just  under  a  third  of  provincial  roads,  along  with  all  county,  township, \nvillage, and special roads, accounting for about 90% of the classified road network. The PMTB \nmanages  road  construction  and  large-scale  maintenance  works,  in  part  through  the  Pu\u2019er \nHighway  Maintenance  and  Management  Company.9 County  transport  bureaus,  supported  by \nstaff in townships and villages, maintain roads below the provincial level. \n \n8. \nPoor  transport  access  is  strongly  associated  with  higher  poverty  levels  in  Pu\u2019er. \nAgricultural trade volumes are limited because many agricultural products are perishable.10 This \ncontributes  to  the  vulnerability  of  farmers  during  periods  when  roads  are  impassable.  Limited \naccess has also led to the prevalence of monopoly transport intermediaries that suppress farm-\ngate prices. Poor transport provision limits interaction with more advanced  areas, and reduces \nthe  effectiveness  of  government-led  agricultural  and  rural  development  programs.  Villagers  in \nmountain areas are less aware of the employment and service opportunities available in urban \nareas, making them less likely to migrate and contribute to rural incomes through remittances.  \n \nCross-border  trade  and  transport.  Kunming,  the  capital  of  Yunnan  Province,  is  the \n9. \nnorthern  anchor  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  that \nconnects the PRC to Thailand via routes through both the Lao PDR and Myanmar. It is a hub for \ntrade between the PRC and countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and also \nIndia and Bangladesh. Yunnan\u2019s external trade is growing rapidly. The total value of imports and \nexports has risen from under $2 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2011, representing an average \nincrease  of  20%  per  annum  over  10  years.  In  2011,  the  values  of  imports  and  exports  were \nroughly  equal  (a  little  over  $6  billion  each),  but  imports  are  growing  substantially  faster  than \nexports. \n \n10. \nDespite  being  the  only  prefecture  in  Yunnan  bordering  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet \nNam,  international  trade  generated  in  Pu\u2019er  was  $100  million  in  2011  (less  than  1%  of  the \nYunnan total). This reflects a lack of high-quality border crossings and road connections. Of the \nprefecture\u2019s  20 existing  border  crossings,  only  three  are  class  I  crossings  (one  with  Myanmar \nand two with the Lao PDR).11 A fourth class I crossing is needed to serve the border with Viet \nNam  at  Longfu  in  Jiangcheng  county.  This  requires  investment  in  upgrading  the  Ning\u2019er\u2013\nJiangcheng\u2013Longfu  road  to  connect  the  border  and  the  provincial  expressway  network.  This \nimprovement,  along  with  the  newly  constructed  Menkang  crossing  to  the  Lao  PDR,  will  place \nJiangcheng  county  at  the  center  of  Yunnan\u2019s  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  since  it  is \nequidistant from the nearest trading centers in Yunnan (Pu\u2019er),  Lao PDR (Phongsali), and Viet \nNam (Dien Bien Phu). \n \n11. \nIn 2005, the Pu\u2019er Municipal Government (PMG) commissioned development of a border \neconomic  cooperation  zone  at  Meng\u2019a  to  serve  trade  with  Myanmar\u2019s  Shan  State.  Between \n\n                                                                                       \n8  Responsibility is assigned to the Simao General Section, supported by a maintenance center (heavy equipment), \ncounty-level  maintenance  sections  (management  staff),  maintenance  stations  (maintenance  workers),  and \nequipment stations (equipment and workers). \n\n9  This company is owned by the Pu\u2019er Municipal Government, but placed under the authority of the PMTB. \n10 Fruit, tobacco, tea, sugar cane, and meat. \n11 Of the 20 border crossings, 17 are with Myanmar, 2 with the Lao PDR, and 1 with Viet Nam. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f2007  and  2012,  total  trade  through  Meng\u2019a  increased from  $59 million  to  $271  million,12 at  an \naverage annual growth rate of 35%.13 However, trade facilities and road connections to Meng\u2019a \nare  inadequate  to  service  demand  and  are  constraining  growth  in  trade  volumes.  To  meet \ndemand  it  is  necessary  to  expand  transit  and  storage  facilities  at  Meng\u2019a  and  improve  road \nconnections from Meng\u2019a to the provincial highway network at Lancang via Menglian. \n \n12. \nRural access. About 94% of the province\u2019s land area is covered by mountains and hills, \nwhich pose a great obstacle to the provision of basic access to rural roads. At present, Pu\u2019er\u2019s \nrural  roads  provide  communities  with  access  to  (i)  markets  for  sale  and  purchase  of  produce \nand agricultural inputs; (ii) collection or processing stations for the sale of cash crops; (iii) towns \nand  cities  for  seasonal  employment  opportunities;  and  (iv)  social  services.  Although  some \nlimited  services  and  facilities  exist  in  or  around  the  administrative  villages  (clinic,  processing \nstations,  and  primary  schools),  most  are  located  in  the  townships  (markets,  hospitals,  primary \nand middle schools, banks, police, coffee collection stations, and tea processing plants). Some \nservices and facilities are only available in the county towns (major markets, large hospitals, and \nsecondary  schools).  Demand  for  rural  transport  is  substantial\u2014between  the  villages  and  the \nnearest  townships  up  to  five  times  a  month  for  each  household,  to  the  county  town  once  or \ntwice a month, and to the prefecture capital a few times a year. \n \n13. \nBetter  approaches  to  road  maintenance  planning  and  management  are  required  to \nprotect Yunnan\u2019s growing stock of rural road assets. Annual funding levels for the different road \ntypes vary according to the county, from CNY1,200 per km for village roads to CNY11,200 per \nkm  for  county  roads.  Nearly  half  this  funding  is  used  for  financing  maintenance  stations \n(construction and maintenance of buildings, and equipment purchases), and about 32% is spent \non servicing pension liabilities, leaving only 25% for actual maintenance work. \n \n14. \nThe lack of a consistently applied road maintenance system results in underutilization of \nfunding  allocations.  In  some  areas  along  the  township  and  village  road  network,  no \nmaintenance is organized. Local villages then assume responsibility, with households voluntarily \ncontributing  a  few  work  days  a  year.  In  practice,  the  burden  is  carried  disproportionately  by \nwomen and the  poor. The system  has failed  to improve road  conditions.  The  voluntary  nature \nresults in low productivity, less than optimal timing, and a lack of investment in technical skills, \nall of which compromise maintenance quality. A community-based maintenance system needs \nto be introduced, with (i) remuneration to ensure timely performance; (ii) training in management \nand  maintenance  practices;  and  (iii)  provision  of  tools,  safety  equipment,  and  construction \nmaterials. A practical, cost-effective system could generate jobs and serve to reduce poverty. \n \n15. \nRoad safety. Yunnan\u2019s road crash fatality rate per 100,000 persons is 4.1 (3.9 in Pu\u2019er), \ncomparable  to  the  rates  in  France  and  the  United  Kingdom.  However,  the  fatality  rate  per \n10,000  vehicles  or  per  billion  vehicle-kilometers  is  3\u20135  times  higher,  implying  that  low  overall \nfatality  rates  are  due  to  the  low  number  of  vehicles,  not  to  high  road  safety.  As  rapid \nmotorization  continues,  fatality  rates  are  likely  to  rise  unless  more  attention  is  given  to  road \nsafety. A road safety emphasis needs to be an integral part of the engineering design process. \n \nOn lower-class rural roads, fatality rates are much lower due to low driving speeds, and \n16. \ncollisions  are  not  common.  Many  of  the  fatalities  that  do  occur  involve  vehicles  rolling  over \nsharp  declines  (47%).  Crashes  resulting  in  multiple  casualties  are  largely  due to  people  using \n\n                                                                                       \n12 Includes the value of international trade from all origins in PRC external to Pu\u2019er prefecture. \n13 The  main  imports  are  ore  sands,  rubber,  timber,  sugar  cane,  and  fruit.  The  main  exports  are  construction \n\nequipment, building materials, commodities, fuel oil, vehicles, and electrical products. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\finappropriate  and  overloaded  vehicles.  This  is  partly  because  rural  village-based  public \ntransport  services  either  do  not  exist  or  are  inadequate.  School  children  are  routinely \ntransported to and from school on motorcycles or tractor-trailers, which offer little protection in a \ncrash. There is a need to establish sustainable models of safe rural public transport services.  \n \nLessons. ADB has supported six road projects in Yunnan since 1994.14 Several lessons \n17. \nhave informed the present project design, most notably the need to (i) carefully plan and monitor \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  (ii)  establish  a  focused  project  performance  and  monitoring \nsystem,  (iii)  consult  widely  with  key  stakeholders  during  the  design  stage,  and  (iv) incorporate \npost-project maintenance planning.  \n \n18. \nStrategic  relevance.  Connecting rural  villages to regional  transport  and  trade  systems \nis in line with the government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan,15 which attaches importance to regionally \nbalanced growth. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s assistance to the PRC under the 2011\u20132015 \ncountry partnership strategy16 in the areas of (i) inclusive growth and balanced development and \n(ii) regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  project  provides  a  replicable  model  that  fits  well \nwith  ADB's  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative, 17  which  identifies  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration,  road  safety,  and  social  sustainability  as  priorities  for  ADB  operations.  This  project \nwill  alleviate  access  constraints  and  ensure  that  benefits  from  the  expanding  regional  road \nnetwork extend to rural areas. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  regional  integration  and  trade  between \nYunnan  Pu\u2019er  and  neighboring  countries.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved \naccessibility  between  rural  and  border  areas,  and  an  improved  regional  transport  network  in \nYunnan Pu\u2019er.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will include three outputs for ADB financing: (i) regional roads development, \n\n20. \n(ii) rural access improvement, and (iii) institutional development. \n \n21. \nOutput  1:  Regional  roads  development.

These factors assess the likelihood that a crash will occur, and the severity of \nthose that do occur, for both existing roads and for road designs. The methodology involves an economic analysis \nof road safety countermeasures, with benefits expressed in the value of deaths and injuries prevented.  \n\n20 Rural  road  assessment  criteria  shall  include  the  following:  (i)  the  road  connects  multiple  village  groups  and \nadministrative  villages;  (ii) the  road  connects  to  a  national  or  provincial  highway  or  an  important  county  road; \n(iii) the road will not have a dead end or stop between village groups; (iv) the road will not involve new construction \nor major impacts on environment and resettlement (safeguards category B or C); and (v) there will be a balance in \ninvestment among the nine counties. \n\n21 The project uses the implementation manual developed for the community-based routine maintenance of roads by \nwomen\u2019s groups in Dehong Yunnan Province that was financed by ADB\u2019s Gender and Development Cooperation \nFund  in  2010.  The  Dehong  pilot  provided  a  boost  to  household  incomes  and  demonstrated  that  routine \nmaintenance can be performed effectively by women\u2019s groups.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fd  Interest during construction on ADB loan computed at 2.164%, being the sum of the 5-year US dollar swap rate on \n3 December  2013  plus  0.5%  spread  and  a  maturity  premium  of  0.2%.  Commitment  charges  were  computed  at \n0.15% of the undisbursed amount. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe PRC requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, 98.8% \n25. \nof which will finance civil works with the remaining 1.2% financing consulting services. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, a maturity premium of 0.2%, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government requested that \nrepayment follows the annuity 10% repayment option and such other terms and conditions set \nforth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  government  will  finance  contingencies  to \ncover any finance shortfall that may arise during implementation. \n \n26. \nThe borrower is the PRC. The PMG will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate \nrisks for the ADB loan. The  borrower has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and \n(ii) assurances that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe borrower will relend the loan proceeds to the Yunnan Provincial Government (YPG) \n27. \non  terms  and conditions  acceptable to  ADB,  and  the  YPG  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan \navailable  to  the  PMG.

The  PMG  will  be the  executing  agency. The  PMTB  will  be the  implementing \nagency  and  will  establish  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  in  charge  of  overall  project \ncoordination  and  liaison  with  ADB.  The  PMO  will  be  directly  in  charge  of  procurement  and \nsupervision of the project under PMTB oversight. County transport bureaus will have day-to-day \nmanagement  responsibility \ninstitutional \ndevelopment,  under  PMO  guidance.  A  project  management  consultant,  a  procurement  agent, \nand external environmental, resettlement, and ethnic minority monitors will support the PMO. \n \n\nthe  outputs  concerning  rural  access  and \n\nfor \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fProcurement  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n30. \nGuidelines  (2013,  as  amended from time  to time).  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation schedule incorporates procurement action before loan effectiveness. The PMG \nrequested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  regional  roads  output  and \nrecruitment of the project management consultant. Advance contracting does not commit ADB \nto subsequently approve the project or finance the procurement costs. Retroactive financing will \napply  to  20%  of  the  loan  proceeds,  for  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  for  not  earlier  than \n12 months before the signing date of the loan agreement. \n \n31. \nFive  of  the  10  Ning\u2019er\u2013Longfu  road  subgrade  contracts  and  the  Menglian\u2013Meng\u2019a \npavement contract will be government financed and tendered with the ADB-financed contracts. \nADB financing and procurement guidelines will be adopted for at least 150 km of rural roads that \nwill  be  designed,  tendered,  and  implemented  first.  The  remaining  rural  roads  will  be  fully \ngovernment  funded  and  will  follow  the  design,  management,  scheduling,  and  implementation \nprocedures used for the ADB-financed rural roads, and use domestic bidding procedures. \n \n32. \nthe project administration manual.22 \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nDecember 2014\u2013September 2020 \n30 December 2020 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nPu\u2019er Municipal Leading Group  \nPu\u2019er Municipal Government \nPu\u2019er Municipal Transport Bureau \nProject management office; 6 staff \nInternational competitive bidding \n\nNational competitive bidding \n\n10 contracts \n\nRural road packaging to be \ndetermined \n80 person-months  \n\n$186.7 \nmillion \n$10.9 million \n\nQuality- and cost-based \nselection (80:20) \nIndividual consultant selection \nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing is proposed for the consulting \nservices recruitment and the regional roads procurement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with Asian Development \nBank's (ADB) Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\n50 person-months \n\n$2.0 million \n\n$0.4 million \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe project includes roads of class I, II, III, and IV.

The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate \nof  return  of  14.5%  and  net  present  value  of  CNY706  million  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  Costs \ninclude  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and \noperation and maintenance. Benefits include savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time, \nand improved road safety. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated robust economic viability. \n \nFinancial evaluation. The project has no revenue-generating components. Construction \n35. \nand  incremental  operating  costs  do  not  represent  a  substantial  financial  burden  on  the  PMG, \nwhich has sufficient financial capacity to provide the required counterpart funds, cover operating \ncosts, and service the ADB loan. Financial management risks were assessed to be moderate. \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 22). \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n37. \nThe  project  will  benefit  a  population  of  405,000.  Pu\u2019er\u2019s  nine  counties  are  national \npoverty counties. The average poverty incidence along the project roads is 36.9%, higher than \nthe  34.8%  Pu\u2019er  average.  The  project  roads  will  serve  the  poor  and  non-poor  by  (i) reducing \ntransport  costs  and  increasing  profitability  of  cash  crops,  (ii) increasing  access  to  nonfarm \nemployment,  and (iii)  improving  access to economic  and  employment  opportunities and social \nservices. The project will stimulate investment, promoting growth of cash crops and the livestock \nindustry.  An  estimated  6,130  skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  will  be  created  during  construction, \ndirectly benefiting local people. The project is designated effective gender mainstreaming. The \ngender action plan identifies a lack of convenient transport services, and constraints imposed by \nlimited  access,  as  the  issues  faced  by  women.  The  gender  action  plan  responds  by  ensuring \n(i) women\u2019s  equitable  participation,  and  promotion  of  employment  and  income  opportunities; \nand (ii) gender-responsive designs targeting village access and road safety improvements.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment  (category  A).  A  consolidated  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA), \n38. \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), and environmental assessment and review framework \nhave  been  prepared  for  the  project.  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \nrequirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  13  June  2014.  Public  consultations  informed  the  project  design  and  EIA  process, \nand  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  and \nrisks are mostly modest and can be limited to an acceptable level through EMP implementation \nand  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  EMP  outlines  potential  impacts,  mitigation  and \nrequirements,  and  EMP \nmonitoring  measures, \nimplementation budgets. The EMP implementation budget is 0.21% of the project budget. The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  sets  out  procedures  for  screening  and \nassessment  of  the  rural  roads  (output  2)  to  be  considered  after  loan  approval.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  are  proposed  to  minimize  environmental  risks. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n\ninstitutional  arrangements, \n\ntraining \n\n \n\n\fThe project will result in the permanent loss of 925 hectares of land and temporary loss \n39. \nof  136  hectares,  mostly  modified  habitats  of  limited  value.24 Other  negative  impacts  including \nnoise,  dust,  sedimentation,  and  erosion  are  short-term  and  localized.  Road  improvements  will \nminimize dust and inefficient driving practices but overall, there will be increases in traffic noise, \npollutants,  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  during  operation.  Aggregate  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nemissions  from  projected  traffic  will  be  278,375  tons  per  annum  by  2030.  This  exceeds  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement\u2019s emission threshold and requires annual reporting. \n \nRegional  road  improvements  will  enhance  border  access.  A  due  diligence  study  on \n40. \nwildlife  trafficking  concluded  that  increased  trafficking  could  be  an  induced  project  impact.  A \nrange  of  mitigation  measures\u2014such  as  capacity  building  of  border  control  staff,  awareness \nraising,  and improvement  of  coordination mechanisms  between government  agencies\u2014will  be \nimplemented through the institutional development output. \n \n41. \nClimate  change. Initial climate risk screening determined that the project is at high risk \nfrom  climate  change  effects.  A  detailed  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  analysis  determined  the \nnature and level of project risks and specified design features to mitigate the project risks.25 \n \n42. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR) \nimpacts are attributable to the regional roads component. The two full resettlement plans for the \nregional roads address the LAR impacts.26 The estimated permanent land acquisition is 4,265.5 \nmu,  including  paddy  land,  non-irrigated  farmland,  forestry  land,  house  plots,  and  other  land.27 \nPermanent land acquisition will partially affect 3,998 households with 15,127 people.  The total \narea  of  house  and  building  demolition  amounts  to  83,155  square  meters,  involving  residential \nhouses  and  simple  structures,  and  will  affect  600  households  with  2,368  people.  Overall,  an \nestimated 17,495 persons from 4,598 rural households will be affected. Rural roads are unlikely \nto  result  in  significant  LAR  impacts.  To  ensure  LAR  impacts  are  managed,  a  resettlement \nframework  with  two  short  sample  resettlement  plans  was  prepared. 28  These  documents \nadequately deal with LAR impacts. \n \n43. \nLAR  costs  are  estimated  at  CNY358.54  million  and  include  land  compensation,  house \nrelocation,  livelihood  support,  taxes,  fees,  and  contingency  funding.  The  PMG  confirmed  that \nadequate counterpart funding will be made available for LAR. Resettlement implementation will \nbe monitored internally and externally. The PMO social safeguard unit will (i) coordinate internal \nsupervision, (ii) report on plan implementation, and (iii) engage an independent external monitor \nfor  semiannual  monitoring  and  reporting.  Public  consultations  will  continue  throughout  the \nproject  cycle.  Capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  will  minimize  LAR  risks.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established before LAR starts. Grievances will be resolved \nand documented in a timely manner. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (ethnic  minorities)  (category  A).  About  71%  of  the  project \n44. \nbeneficiaries  represent  ethnic  minorities.  The  PMG  prepared  an  ethnic  minority  development \nplan  to  ensure  the  project  does  not  adversely  impact  ethnic  minority  communities  and  that \nethnic  minorities  actively  participate  and  benefit  in  a  culturally  appropriate  way.  Investigations \n\n                                                                                       \n24 These estimates were from the feasibility study report and EIA report and include land use types over and above \nthose considered in the resettlement plan. Following detailed design and finalization of the resettlement plan, these \nfigures should be updated. \n\n25 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement\u20141 hectare = 15 mu; 1 mu = 666.7 square meters.  \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\ffound  that  improved  access  may  increase  the  Wa  and  Lahu  ethnic  minorities\u2019  vulnerability  to \nhuman and drug trafficking risks. Measures are incorporated in the ethnic minority development \nplan  to  complement  the  government\u2019s  existing  programs.  The  plan  adequately  deals  with  the \nidentified  risks.  The  plan  is  posted  on  the  ADB  website  and  has  been  disclosed  to  the  ethnic \nminority communities in the project area. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n45.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The integrated benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.

Early \nrecruitment of the project management consultant will support establishment of safeguard \nmonitoring and reporting protocols. \nA procurement agent was recruited in July 2014.  \nThe PMG\u2019s fiscal situation is adequate. Through a loan assurance, the PMG has agreed \nto ensure timely provision of counterpart funding. \nTargeted project interventions will enhance community awareness and develop \nenforcement capacity to combat human, drug, and wildlife trafficking. Cooperation with \nADB regional technical assistance will increase the effectiveness of project interventions \naimed at combating wildlife trafficking. Representatives from provincial authorities \nresponsible for trafficking control will be represented on the project steering committee. \nThe executing agency has committed to provide budget allocations to finance the project \ntrafficking mitigating measures. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMG = Pu\u2019er Municipal Government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n46. \nThe  government  and  the  PMG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  and  project  documents.
