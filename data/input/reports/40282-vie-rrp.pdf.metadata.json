It will enable people to resume their normal \nlives  by  restoring  access  to  basic  services.  The  project  design  is \nbased on the damage and needs assessment made jointly by the \nGovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  March\u2013\nApril 2006. The Project supports increased disaster preparedness \nthe  Government  mainstream \nand  mitigation,  and  will  help \nprevention  and  preparedness  activities  into  the  development \nprocess  to  prepare  for  and  avoid  the  worst  impacts  of  natural \ndisasters.  Risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  will  be  used  to \nidentify appropriate risk reduction measures. \n \nFlooding  triggered  by  typhoons  and  storms  is the  most  prevalent \nand serious natural disaster in Viet Nam. In 2005, tropical storms \nand typhoons affected large parts of Viet Nam, causing loss of life \nand  extensive  damage \ntypes  of \ninfrastructure  that  are  critical  to  the  livelihoods  of  poor  rural \nhouseholds  were  destroyed  in  the  10  most  seriously  affected \nprovinces: Ha Giang, Ha Tinh, Nam Dinh, Nghe An, Phu Tho, Phu \nYen, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, and Yen Bai. \n \nThe  calamitous  damage  resulting  from  the  2005  typhoons  and \nstorms was not the outcome of a single cataclysmic event\u2014it was \nthe  cumulative  impact  of  successive,  intense  storms  that  struck \nmany  provinces,  some  of  them  repeatedly,  over  6  months.  The \ncost  of  damage  to  rural  infrastructure  in  the  affected  provinces \nwas estimated to be equivalent to $365 million, excluding damage \nto infrastructure under central Government authority such as sea \ndikes (estimated at $650 million\u2013$700 million) and flood protection \nembankments. The consequent loss of economic opportunities is \na  significant  burden  for  the  poor  who  now  also  experience \nreduced  access  to  markets,  schools,  services,  and  clean  water. \nWithout external budget support, the Government will face a delay \n\nin  16  provinces.

Such \nrepairs  are  of  inadequate  quality  and  do  not  provide  improved \ndisaster  resistance  or  mitigation  measures,  reinforcing  a  cycle  of \nreactive  response  to  disasters  and  severely  limiting  disaster \nrecovery  and  economic  development  in  the  affected  areas.  The \nGovernment asked ADB for emergency assistance to rehabilitate \nand  reconstruct  basic  rural  infrastructure,  and  for  risk  reduction \nmeasures to reduce vulnerability in the project provinces. \n \nThe Project\u2019s impact will be sustained economic growth in the 10 \nprovinces severely affected by typhoons in 2005. Its outcome will \nbe  rapid  resumption  of  livelihoods  and  reduced  vulnerability  to \nnatural disasters in the affected areas.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $59.9  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.8 million.  \n \nA  loan  of  $50.97  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  loan \nsavings  from  ongoing  projects  in  Viet  Nam.  The  loan  will  have  a \nterm of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years, an interest \nrate  of  1%  per  year  with  repayment  of  principal  at  2%  a  year  for \nthe first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter. \nThe  loan  will  finance  85%  of  the  project  cost  ($59.9  million);  the \nGovernment will finance about $8.9 million or 15%. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n \nThe Project will be executed by the Central Project Management \nUnit (CPMU) in MARD's Agriculture Projects Management Board. \nThe  CPMU  director  in  Hanoi  will  be  the  project  director.  The \nCPMU  will \n(i)  provide  overall  project  management  and \ncoordination; (ii) liaise with the provincial people's committee and \nagriculture  and  rural  development  department  (DARD)  in  each \nprovince  to  prepare,  select,  and  implement  subprojects;  (iii) \nprovide advice and project orientation training to the DARDs; (iv) \ncoordinate with relevant agencies of MARD and other ministries to \nguide  the  DARDs  in  relation  to  design  standards;  (v)  help  the \nDARDs  in  procuring  goods  and  services  using  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB); (vi) monitor progress and budgets, and \nprepare  progress  reports  covering  the  Project  by  consolidating \nreports \nthe  project \ncompletion report. A team of international consultants will help the \n\nfrom  each  province;  and  (vii)  prepare \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nCPMU  and  the  provincial  implementing  agencies.  For  each \nsubproject  prepared  in  the  first  year,  the  feasibility  study  and \ndesign  products  will  be  checked  by  the  consultants.  The  DARDs \nwill  implement  the  works  through  provincial  project  management \nunits. \n \nCivil  works  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2006).  State-owned \nenterprises  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are  legally \nand  financially  autonomous,  independent  from  MARD  and  the \nDARDs, and operate on the basis of commercial law and practice. \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $2  million \nequivalent  will  be  procured  through  ICB  using  ADB's  standard \nbidding documents for the procurement of works (large contracts). \nPrequalification  will  be  required  for  large  or  complex  subprojects \nas  determined  by  ADB  during  the  feasibility  study  phase.  Prior \nreview  by  ADB  of  invitations  to  bid,  bidding  documents,  and  bid \nevaluation  reports  will  be  required  for  procurement  under  ICB \nprocedures. The bidding period will be 42 days. \n \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  or  less  will  be \nprocured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. \nThe  Government's  standard  bidding  documents  and  procedures \nwill  be  used  if  these  comply  closely  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2006).  Postqualification  (or  the  national  contractor's \nregistration  or  classification  system)  will  be  used  for  NCB \ncontracts.  The  bidding  period  will  be  21  days  for  NCB  contracts. \nPrior review by ADB of invitations to bid, bidding documents, and \nbid evaluation reports will be required for the first NCB contract in \neach province. Subsequently, retroactive approval procedures will \nbe followed.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  60  person-months  of  national  and  27 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting.  Expertise  will  be \nrequired \nrisk  assessment,  engineering \ninvestigations  and  design,  geotechnical  engineering,  economic \nand  financial  analyses,  and  social  and  environmental  aspects. \nMARD  will  select  and  engage  a  firm  of  international  consultants \nusing  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  biodata \ntechnical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2006). \n \nThe CPMU may engage consultants, either as individuals or as a \nfirm,  to  assist  with  preparatory  activities,  and  the  DARDs  will \nengage national consulting firms to prepare feasibility studies and \ndetailed designs of subprojects, complete contract documentation \nof  works,  help  supervise  construction,  and  monitor  performance. \nADB  has  agreed  that,  for  contracts  not  exceeding  $100,000, \nsingle-source  selection  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2006)  may  be  used  to  select  national \nconsulting firms.  \n\nin  natural  disaster \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nAbout 450,000 residents of remote areas of the project provinces \nwill benefit directly from improved access to markets, schools, and \nother services; rapid resumption of income-earning activities; and \ngreater  security  from  natural  disasters.  Rehabilitated  structures \nwill  have  higher  resistance  to  floods,  storm  surge,  waves,  and \nother  typhoon-related  impacts,  based  on  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments. The causes of structure failure will be examined to \nensure  better  design  standards  where  necessary,  and  the \ncompleted  works  will  be  integrated  into  a  database  linked  to \nprovincial disaster preparedness plans. \n \nSome  large  or  complex  subprojects  will  require  investigations  to \nsupport  their  feasibility  and  design  studies.  Their  implementation \ncould  extend  beyond  the  project  completion  date.  To  avoid  the \nrisk of noncompletion of any such subprojects, only those that can \nbe  completed  within  the  implementation  period  will  be  retained. \nThe risk of cost overrun for large subprojects will be minimized by \nensuring careful cost estimation at the design stage.  \n \nFor greater safety and typhoon resistance, sea dikes may have to \nbe  set  back  from  the  seashore  when  they  are  rehabilitated.  This \nwill  involve  significant  land  use  change  and  could  lead  to  those \nsubprojects  being  classified  as  category  A  for  resettlement \nimpacts, effectively removing them from the Project. Under such a \nscenario,  alternative  subprojects  would  be  selected  from  among \nthose  identified  during  the  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment \nMission,  and  possibly  also  from  among  those  that  have  not  yet \nbeen inspected. To avoid the risk of having unsuitable subprojects \nfinanced  by  the  Project,  the  selection  criteria  will  be  strictly \nadhered  to,  requiring  vigilance  and  close  scrutiny  on  the  part  of \nMARD and ADB administration staff. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage \nProject.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nRural  Poverty  and  Natural  Disasters.  Viet  Nam  has  one  of  the  fastest  growing \neconomies in Asia. With average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of about 7.5% \nover the last decade, poverty incidence has dramatically reduced from 58.1% in 1993 to 23.2% \nin 2004.2 Nevertheless, some groups have benefited less than others. Viet Nam\u2019s population of \n83 million is still predominantly rural (60 million or 73%) and poverty incidence remains higher in \nrural (26.4%) than in urban areas (13.7%).  \n \n3. \nRural communities remain dependent on the agriculture and natural resources sector for \nlivelihoods and basic needs.3 Hence, improvement of agriculture and sustainable exploitation of \nnatural  resources  are  critical  to  the  well-being  of  a  large  proportion  of  the  population  and  the \nmajority of Viet Nam's poor. The most persistent poverty is found in remote areas where access \nto basic infrastructure and services is poor, and where natural resources are under increasing \npressure. Ethnic minority groups are often concentrated in these areas. About 69.3% of ethnic \nminority households were living below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 23.1% of the Kinh \nand Chinese households (para. 17). \n \n4. \nHouseholds whose consumption is just over the poverty line are vulnerable to external \nshocks  (for example,  natural  disasters,  crop  failure,  illness)  and  remain  at  risk  of  falling  below \nthe poverty line. The highest poverty incidence (using international poverty standards) is in the \nnorthern  mountains  (51.9%),  north  central  coast  (36.5%),  and  central  highlands  (32.8%) \nregions.  The  largest  absolute  numbers  of  poor  (using  national  poverty  standards)  are  in  the \nnorth central coast (0.30 million households), Red River delta (0.29 million), northern mountains \n(0.26 million), and Mekong River delta (0.23 million). Nghe An and Thanh Hoa provinces (north \ncentral  coast)  have  the  largest  absolute  number  of  poor  households.  Poverty  incidence  and \nfrequent occurrence of natural disasters are highly correlated (Table 1). \n \nPolicy  and  Institutional  Context.  The  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction \n5. \nProgram  and  the  Program  on  Socio-Economic  Development  of  extremely  disadvantaged \ncommunes  (Program  135)  are  national  programs  that  target  the  extremely  poor.  Both  were \ninitiated  in  1998  and  cover  exemption  of  fees  and  taxes  (Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty \nReduction)  and  provision  of  grants  for  small  infrastructure  (Program  135).  The  Government  is \nalso preparing a national target program for poverty reduction4 and socioeconomic development \nprogram  for  communes  with  extreme  difficulties  in  ethnic  minority  and  mountainous  areas  (a \nsuccessor to Program 135) under the State Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The name of the proposed Project has been changed at the Government's request during loan negotiations from \n\nCalamity Damage Rehabilitation Project to Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project. \n\n2   Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2005.  The  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (draft).  Hanoi: \n\nMinistry of Planning and Investment. \n\n3   The  contribution  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  aquaculture  to  GDP  was  20.5%  in  2005,  but  the  sector\u2019s \n\ncontribution is expected to decline to 15.5% by 2010. \n4   Under the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nIn recognition of the strong link between vulnerability to natural disasters and persistent \n6. \npoverty,  the  Government's  5-year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  for  2006\u20132010 \n(footnote 2) will increase investment in its poverty reduction programs  in remote and disaster-\nstricken  regions.  For  such  vulnerable  areas,  the  SEDP  sets  12  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment targets to be achieved by 2010; one is to build social welfare networks to reduce \nvulnerability of the disadvantaged and poor. This is to be achieved by, among others, preventing \nand mitigating natural disasters.  \n \nThe Government set up the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) in \n7. \n1990, with supporting provincial and district committees. CCFSC, a cross-ministerial institution,5 \nis  mandated  to  help  the  Government  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  overcome  natural  disasters \nand their consequences. It coordinates emergency response and has a role in the recovery and \nreconstruction  after  disasters.  CCFSC  works  in  close  liaison  with  the  Department  of  Dike \nManagement,  Flood  and  Storm  Control6 of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \n(MARD). \n \nEmbedded  in  the  Government's  disaster  management  strategies 7  is  the  concept  of \n8. \npreventing  and  minimizing  the  effects  of  natural  calamities  as  a  regular  part  of  development. \nWith  the  assistance  of  the  Natural  Disaster  Mitigation  Partnership8 led  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank-financed  Natural  Disaster  Risk  Management \nProject,9 the Government is strengthening its disaster risk management strategy to improve (i) \ndisaster \ninformation  sharing;  (ii)  disaster  preparedness  and \nemergency  relief;  (iii)  incorporation  of  disaster  mitigation  into  development  programs;  and  (iv) \nrehabilitation  and  long-term  recovery  after  disasters.  The  Government  thereby  aims  to \nconsolidate  poverty  reduction  achievements,  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  to  natural \ndisasters, and prevent natural disasters from pushing marginally nonpoor rural households back \ninto poverty.  \n \nThe  Government's  priorities  in  natural  disaster  management  are  (i)  securing  life  (early \n9. \nwarning  and  evacuation,  and  provision  of  supplies  and  temporary  response  to  damage),  (ii) \nsecuring  health  and  education  services,  (iii)  securing  property  and  short-term  livelihood \nactivities,  (iv)  ensuring  continued  functioning  of  essential  infrastructure,  and  (v)  rebuilding \ndamaged infrastructure. Its targets through to 2010 are (i) improve community awareness and \nlocal participation; (ii) reduce the number of people killed annually from 800 to less than 200; (iii) \nreduce  the  direct  economic  losses  from  an  average  of  2%  of  GDP  to  less  than  1%;  and  (iv) \nminimize  the  negative  effects  of  disasters  on  the  poor,  the  environment,  sustainable  and \nequitable development, and cultural heritage. \n\nforecasting,  warning,  and \n\n                                                 \n5   Under  MARD\u2019s  leadership,  CCFSC  coordinates  13  ministries  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the  Government  and  other \nagencies such as Post and Telecommunications, Hydrometeorology, Voice of Vietnam, and Vietnam Television. \n6   The  department  is  the  implementing  agency  for  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  Natural  Disaster \n\nMitigation Partnership. \n\n7   UNDP. 1995.

Flooding  triggered \nby typhoons and storms is the most prevalent natural disaster.11 In the large river deltas of the \nRed and Mekong river basins, flooding is extensive and prolonged throughout the wet season. \nMany  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rivers,  however,  are  short  and  steep\u2014heavy  rainfall  in  their  catchments \nproduces  intense,  short  duration  floods  (flash  floods)  that  frequently  occur  without  warning.12 \nThe five main disaster hazard zones are in three regions (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Principle Natural Disaster Zones in Viet Nam \n\n \nRegion \nNorth \n \n \nCenter \n \n \nSouth \na  The  center  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  Mekong  River  delta  suffer  the  greatest  loss  of  life  and  property  due  to  natural \n\nFlash floods, landslides, earthquakes \nMonsoon river floods, typhoon storms, storm surges \n \nTyphoon storms, flash floods, droughts \nFlash floods, landslides \n \nRiver flooding from upstream, typhoons on the coast \n\nDisaster Zonea \nNorthern mountains \nRed River delta \n \nCentral provinces \nCentral highlands \n \nMekong River delta \n\nPrinciple Hazard \n\ndisasters. \n\nSource:  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2002.

Typhoons  not  only  cause  loss  of  life  and \ndamage to property as direct impacts, they also raise sea levels13 and flood valuable land with \nsaltwater (disrupting livelihoods for long periods), and cause extensive loss of coastal property \nthrough  wave-induced  erosion.  The  damage  tends  to  be  cumulative  because  breached  sea \ndikes  cannot  be  repaired  midseason.  The  country\u2019s  more  than  2,000  km  of  sea  dikes,  built \nmainly in the 1960s, are vulnerable to wave action and collapse in extreme events.14  \n \n12. \nAs  they  move  inland  and  degenerate  into  tropical  depressions,  typhoons  bring  heavy \nrain  to  areas  remote  from  the  sea,  often  causing  flash  floods  with  devastating  impacts  on \nhumans,  livestock,  farmland,  and  other  property.  Land  clearing  for  agriculture  aggravates  the \nrisk of highly destructive landslides in steep areas.15 Ancillary damage includes the deposition of \nsediment over broad tracts of farmland and the infilling of reservoirs and diversion weirs. \n \n\n                                                 \n10  Natural disasters cause an estimated economic loss of $200 million per year and affect about 72% of Viet Nam\u2019s \n\npopulation. \n\n11  United Nations Development Programme. 2002. Capacity Building for Disaster Management in Viet Nam. Hanoi. \n12 These events are difficult to forecast because of the short time over which they develop. Therefore establishing an \n\neffective early warning system is difficult. \n\n13  During the last 30 years, 50% of typhoons caused surges of 1 meter (m) or more and 11% 2.5 m or more. \n14  Only those constructed during the last decade are strong enough to withstand force eight or nine storms. \n15  Landslides  result  from  deep  saturation  of  soil  on  steep  hillsides  and  are  particularly  fearsome  phenomena.  They \ncan occur without warning and sweep away or bury anything in their path, including, on occasion, whole villages.  \n\n\f4 \n\nIn the decade up to 2005, storms caused 6,000 deaths, destroyed 320,000 houses and \n13. \nalmost  9,000  boats,  and  resulted  in  capital  stock  loss  of  more  than  $2.5  billion,  representing \nabout  5%  of  gross  annual  capital  formation  (footnote  9).  The  impact  of  floods  is  increasing, \nreflecting the concentration of population and economic activity in coastal and low-lying areas, \nand possibly also the increased frequency and intensity of storms due to global climate change.  \n \n14. \nTyphoons  and  Related  Phenomena  in  2005.  Although  the  2005  northwest  Pacific \nstorm season was considered average,16 the tropical storms and typhoons that made landfall in \nViet  Nam  during  July\u2013December  2005  caused  extensive  damage  in  16  provinces.  Of  these, \ntyphoon Damrey with sustained wind speeds of up to 180 km per hour was the most violent and \ndamaging. It was Viet Nam's worst typhoon in 10 years.  \n \nDamrey affected coastal provinces from Quang Ninh in the north to Quang Nam and Da \n15. \nNang  in  the  south,  and  caused  a  sea  run-up  of  3\u20134  meters  during  high  tides.  It  destroyed \nprimary dikes in Nam Dinh and Thanh Hoa provinces, enabling seawater to penetrate up to  4 \nkm  inland  and  flood  thousands  of  hectares  (ha)  of  rice  fields  and  aquaculture.  Such  damage \nwas made possible because sea defenses were weakened 2 weeks earlier by the less severe \ntropical storm Vicente. Few human lives were lost due to Damrey in coastal areas because of \nthe  high  state  of  disaster  readiness. 17  However,  heavy  rains  associated  with  the  typhoon \nclaimed  76  lives  in  two  northern  upland  provinces,  Yen  Bai  and  Lao  Cai.  Within  a  month  of \nDamrey,  typhoon  Kaitak  struck  7  of  the  provinces  flooded  a  few  weeks  earlier.  It  claimed  19 \nlives, injured 44, and left another 11 unaccounted for. Violent storms continued up to the end of \nDecember 2005. A summary damage and needs assessment is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nThe  calamitous  damage  resulting  from  the  2005  typhoons  and  storms  was  not  the \n16. \noutcome  of  a  single  cataclysmic  event\u2014it  was  the  cumulative  impact  of  successive,  intense \nstorms that struck many provinces, some of them repeatedly, over 6 months. A particularity of \nthe  damage  is  that  it  occurred  in  a  multitude  of  sites  scattered  over  a  large  area.  Due  to  the \ndistances  and  relative  inaccessibility,  the  extent  of  cumulative  damage  was  not  immediately \nrecognized in the aftermath of the typhoon season. After laboriously compiling district statistics, \nCCFSC estimated the cost of damage to infrastructure in affected provinces to be equivalent to \n$365  million  (Appendix  2,  Table  A2.2),  excluding  damage  to  infrastructure  under  central \ngovernment authority such as sea dikes (damage estimated at $650 million\u2013$700 million) and \nflood protection embankments.  \n \n17. \nImpact  on  Vulnerable  Groups  in  the  Affected  Areas.  Poverty  in  the  project \nprovinces18 is above the national average of 24.1% (2004), based on the Government's poverty \ncriteria.19 Ha Giang (rank 2) and Yen Bai (rank 9) have the highest incidence of poverty; Nam \nDinh (rank 41) and Phu Yen (rank 49) have the lowest (Table 2). The remaining provinces are \nall  among  the  20  poorest  provinces  in  Viet  Nam.  Ethnic  minorities  are  strongly  represented  in \nthe  project  provinces,  especially  in  the  north-western  provinces  (Table  2).  As  noted  in  the \nSEDP, the proportion of ethnic minorities living in poverty in the mountainous areas of the north, \nnorthwest, and northern central regions ranges from 4 to 5 times the average for Viet Nam.  \n\n                                                 \n16  Saunders  M.  and  A.

The calamity also impacted natural resources, which \nare the main sources of income for the poor.20 Poor economic conditions encourage migration \nfrom the provinces, introducing a new set of risks in terms of social dislocation and health (e.g., \nfrom  HIV/AIDS).21 A  prolonged  reconstruction  program  would  force  many  vulnerable  people  to \nmigrate in search of employment and greater economic security for their families.  \n \n\nGovernment Response \n\n2. \n \nA joint assessment team22 rated the Government's disaster preparedness and response \n19. \nto Damrey as efficient. The Government's early warnings and emergency measures prevented \nlarge loss of life; and the provision of food, shelter, and other essentials to families evacuated \nfrom their homes or otherwise deprived of normal means of livelihood by the events was timely. \nAs  typhoon  Damrey  approached,  the  Government  released  about  $12.5  million  to  cover \npreparations  including  transport,  life  jackets,  and  materials  for  dike  strengthening.  Officials \nremained in the most vulnerable areas throughout the typhoon to direct operations, and as the \nstorm weakened, staff from line ministries worked with provincial agencies to assess relief and \nrehabilitation needs. Local governments and nongovernment organizations provided emergency \nfood  to  people  and  organized  voluntary  services  to  rescue  people  and  temporarily  raise  and \nstrengthen  sea  dikes.  The  National  Red  Cross  provided  cash  and  essential  rations  to \nhouseholds in Hai Phong, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, and Thanh Hoa provinces.  \n \n20. \nDuring  and  following  the  2005  typhoons  and  storms,  the  Government  ensured  that  all \nthose  who  lost  houses  were  provided  with  shelter\u2014in  many  cases  new  houses.  All  major \n\n                                                 \n20  Typical impacts on natural resources include the (i) flooding of large areas of farmland and freshwater bodies by \nseawater; (ii) contamination of wells by polluted floodwater; (iii) erosion of river banks leading to loss of productive \nland; and (iv) large-scale landslides, which removed farmland, trees, and other vegetation. \n\n21  Some  ethnic  minority  groups,  such  as  Thai  in  Ha  Giang  province,  expressed  a  desire  to  move  to  the  central \n\nhighlands region as a livelihood strategy. \n\n22 Joint assessment report by a team fielded through the Disaster Management Working Group immediately after the \nstorm.  The  team  included  representatives  from  CCFSC,  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross  and  Red \nCrescent Societies, MARD, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Oxfam Great Britain, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and \nUnited Nations Development Programme. \n\n\f6 \n\ntransport  networks  and  essential  social  infrastructure  (especially  water  supply  systems,  health \ncenters, schools, and utilities) were reinstated, although many only in a temporary way. \n \n\n3. \n\nAsian Development Bank Response and Strategy \n\nADB's  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  policy23 provides  for  emergency  assistance \n21. \nfollowing both natural and civil disasters. The principal funding mechanism for reconstruction is \nthe  emergency  assistance  loan  (EAL),  which  focuses  on  immediate  short-term  assistance  to \nrebuild  high-priority  physical  assets  and  restore  capacity  and  productive  activities.  Helping \ncountries prepare for and avoid the worst impacts of natural disasters is a primary goal of the \npolicy.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by  applying  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  to  identify \nappropriate  mitigation  measures,  and  mainstreaming  prevention  and  preparedness  activities \ninto the development process.24 \n \n22. \nOn 25 October 2005, the Ministry of Planning and Investment made an initial request for \nADB  assistance.  The  request  was  made  following  Damrey  but  before  the  occurrence  of  two \nadditional  intense  storms,  typhoon  Kaitak  in  October\u2013November  and  tropical  storm  25W  in \nDecember 2005. ADB fielded scoping missions to assess the nature and extent of damage in \nNovember 2005 and February 2006. The missions concluded that damage caused by Damrey \nand  succeeding  storms  was  extensive  and  that  its  repair  would  be  beyond  the  capacity  of \nprovincial authorities. On 20 January 2006, the Ministry of Planning and Investment asked ADB \nto  prepare  an  EAL  using  loan  savings  from  ongoing  projects.  On  26  January  2006,  MARD \nestablished  the  Central  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU)  to  prepare  and  administer  the \nProject.  \n \n23. \nFrom 27 March to 28 April 2006, ADB\u2019s Damage and Needs Assessment Mission held \nworkshops  with  representatives  of  MARD,  the  provincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment  (DARDs),  and  provincial  people's  committees  (PPCs)  in  the  10  most  severely \naffected provinces (Appendix 2). The Mission visited selected subproject sites to make a rapid \nassessment  of  social,  technical,  and  environmental  conditions.  All  parties  generally  agreed  to \nImplementation  and  financing  arrangements  during  the  workshops;  this  was  confirmed  in  the \nMission\u2019s  wrap-up  meeting  on  28  April  2006.  The  Mission  and  the  Government  signed  a \nmemorandum of understanding on 3 May 2006. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons in Disaster Management \n\nA review of project performance audit reports, project completion reports, and ADB-wide \n24. \nexperience 25  with  rehabilitation  assistance  indicates  the  following  lessons:  (i)  the  most \nappropriate  focus  for  an  EAL  is  restoration  of  economic  activity  to  reduce  vulnerability  of \naffected  communities; 26  (ii)  more  effective  central  and  local  coordination  is  needed  during \ndesign and implementation to reduce delays and improve impact; and (iii) EAL implementation \nplaces  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  agency  staff,  and  the  support  of  consultants  is  often \nneeded  to  achieve  effective  supervision  and  efficient  administration.  Other  lessons  include  (i) \nbeneficiary  participation  is  important  in  terms  of  prioritization  and  subsequent  operation  and \nmaintenance of works; (ii) care needs to be given to environmental and social aspects in EALs \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2004.

Manila: ADB (third draft). \n\n26  People  are  more  resilient  and  less  dependent  on  outside  assistance  when  they  can  quickly  resume  their  normal \n\nincome-earning activities. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nas they can be seriously compromised in the rush to complete civil works; (iii) arrangements for \ndisbursement and use of imprest accounts should be simple and workable so that the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  have  rapid  access  to  funds  as  needed;  and  (iv)  anticorruption \nmeasures need to be fully integrated into standard operating procedures. \n \n25. \nCentral  project  management  units  have  proven  to  be  efficient  and  effective  at \ncoordinating  and  supervising  EALs.  Their  value,  however,  is  dependent  on  being  able  to  use \nflexible procedures that are not constrained by normal government approval mechanisms. The \nuse  of  multiple  executing  or  implementing  agencies  for  different  subsectors  is  inefficient \nbecause  it  increases  complexity  and  results  in  implementation  delays  and  poor  coordination. \nHence, a single executing agency operating through an experienced central management unit is \npreferable.  Faster  and  more  efficient  implementation  can  be  achieved  when  the  executing \nagency  has  had  recent  implementation  experience,  preferably  in  similar  work,  and  has  well-\nestablished disbursement and reimbursement procedures. \n \n26. \nEALs benefit from the use of both advance procurement action and retroactive financing \nto  make  best  use  of  construction  seasons  and  undertake  concurrent  activities  (e.g.,  early \ncommencement  of  design  contracts  and  simultaneous  initiation  of  tendering  for  contracts). \nMinimizing the number of contracts reduces administration; and greater flexibility in government \nprocurement procedures increases efficiency in selecting consultants and contractors.  \n \n27. \nTo improve the quality of civil works, independent consultants may be needed to review \ndesigns  and  supervise  implementation,  especially  for  large  or  complex  subprojects\u2014a  need \noften  underestimated  during  EAL  preparation.  Mobilization  of  consultants  is  often  delayed  by \nregulations;  single-source  selection  of  design \ncumbersome  government  procurement \nconsultants  may  be  preferable  for  an  EAL.  Civil  works  contracts  should,  where  possible,  be \nawarded  to  contractors  already  active  on  similar  contracts  or  who  have  recently  successfully \ncompleted similar works. The selection of supervision consultants by ADB can greatly shorten \nthe  mobilization  delay  and  should  be  incorporated  when  normal  government  procedures  are \nrigid and time-consuming. \n \n\n5.  \n\nProject Rationale \n\n28.  While  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  growth  is  commendable  for  its  impact  on  income  disparities \n(e.g., reducing the poverty ratio of 54% in 1993 to about 20% by 2004), pockets of poverty need \nto be addressed to make development truly inclusive and to ensure development quality. Areas \nthat are remote, lack infrastructure, have few resources, or are vulnerable to natural disasters \nhave  stagnated.  The  SEDP  has  a  strong  results  orientation,  with  performance  indicators  that \ninclude  the  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  For \ninvestments  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure,  the  SEDP  gives  priority  to  disaster-stricken \nregions  and  accords  special  attention  to  vulnerable  groups  including  ethnic  minorities. \nPreventing and mitigating natural disasters is one of its key strategies for reducing vulnerability \nfor the disadvantaged and the poor. In support of this, the Government\u2019s disaster management \nstrategy  emphasizes  measures  to  prevent  and  minimize  the  effects  of  natural  calamities  as  a \nregular part of development programs and projects.  \n \n29.  Many  types  of  infrastructure  critical  to  the  livelihoods  of  poor  rural  households  were \ndestroyed  in  2005.  These  were  mostly  small-scale  and  within  the  authority  of  provincial \nagencies. 27  Flash  floods  swept  away  bridges,  roads,  irrigation  control  structures,  diversion \nweirs, and canals. Rainfall-induced landslides cut off roads and carried away houses and other \n\n                                                 \n27  Except for primary sea dikes and major flood control schemes funded by the central Government. \n\n\f8 \n\nvital  property,  including  large  tracts  of  terraced  agricultural  land  and  irrigation  systems. \nProductive land adjacent to many rivers was covered by river-borne sediment. Flood protection \ninfrastructure  was  lost,  leaving  rural  communities  in  a  heightened  state  of  vulnerability.  The \nbreaching of sea dikes led to inundation by seawater of coastal plains used for rice farming and \naquaculture, and rendered these areas at greater risk of flooding during even moderate storms. \nThe  consequent  loss  of  economic  opportunities  is  a  significant  burden  to  the  poor\u2014they  now \nalso suffer from reduced access to markets, schools, services, and clean water.  \n \nThe Government recognizes the need to reinstate essential services to affected areas as \n30. \na  matter  of  urgency,  and  has  already  provided  temporary  repair  for  many  of  the  damaged \nstructures  using  its  emergency  contingency  funds.  Such  repairs  are  of  inadequate  quality  and \ndo  not  provide  improved  disaster  resistance  or  mitigation  measures. 28  In  the  absence  of \nconcerted  and  coordinated  rehabilitation  efforts,  such  temporary  repairs  reinforce  a  cycle  of \nreactive  response  to  disasters,  severely  limiting  disaster  recovery  and  impacting  on  economic \ndevelopment in poor areas. To help make the transition to a more proactive approach based on \ndisaster  preparedness  and  mitigation,  the  Government  requested  ADB  assistance  for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  basic  rural  infrastructure,  as  well  as  for  risk  reduction \nmeasures to reduce vulnerability, in the 10 most severely affected provinces. Without external \nbudget support, the Government would face a delay of 4\u22125 years in reconstruction, the cost of \nwhich would increase as succeeding storms compound the existing damage.  \n \nADB's  country  strategy  and  program  for  2007\u2013201029 is  strictly  aligned  with  national \n31. \ntargets  and  includes  the  provision  that,  upon  Government  request,  assistance  be  provided  on \nan  emergency  basis  to  reinstate  essential  infrastructure  following  natural  disasters.  ADB  has \ntherefore  agreed  to  help  the  Government  reinstate  essential  rural  infrastructure  damaged  by \ntyphoons  and  storms  in  2005.  The  Project  was  prepared  following  the  EAL  requirements \n(footnotes 23 and 24). Hence, the Project focuses on immediate short-term assistance to rebuild \nhigh-priority physical assets and restore capacity and productive activities, and does not attempt \nto  address  medium-  to  long-term  investments  or  other  needs  unrelated  to  the  emergency. \nRehabilitation  is  based  on  considerations  of  need,  technical  feasibility,  cost-effectiveness,  and \nsustainability. The works represent least-cost solutions that nevertheless incorporate measures \ndesigned to give (i) greater resistance to natural disasters where necessary and (ii) higher levels \nof  protection  to  communities  where  feasible.  The  scope  of  each  subproject  reflects  the \npredamage situation and does not include additional features (e.g., road widening, canal lining, \nexpansion  of  irrigation  service  area).  To  prevent  a  recurrence  of  the  type  of  damage  that \noccurred  in  2005,  subprojects  may  incorporate  higher  design  standards  than  those  of  the \noriginal  structures  (e.g.,  higher  deck  levels  for  bridges).  The  Project  will  help  mainstream \nappropriate prevention and preparedness activities into the development process to prepare for \nand  avoid  the  worst  impacts  of  natural  disasters.30 Risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  will  be \nused to identify appropriate risk reduction measures. \n \n32. \nProcessing of the EAL began upon receipt of the Government's request on 20 January \n2006  and  continued  in  step  with  the  Government's  procedures.  The  total  processing  time  (10 \nmonths) was much longer than would normally be acceptable for an EAL.31 Some of the delay \n\n                                                 \n28  Much  of  the  rural  infrastructure  destroyed  in  2005  was  underdesigned  in  terms  of  disaster  resistance.  Its \n\nreconstruction to original or lower standards facilitates repeat failures when natural disasters recur. \n\n29  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Philippines. Manila. \n30  In support of the Project, separate technical assistance is being prepared to enhance the Government's capability \n\nto carry out risk and vulnerability assessments.  \n\n31  EAL processing should not exceed 12 weeks (footnote 23). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nresulted from the Government's unavoidable review and approval steps,32 but delays were also \nintroduced  by  the  need  to  compile  a  comprehensive  damage  assessment  in  the  16  affected \nprovinces, and to identify and secure surplus loan funds from within ADB's Viet Nam portfolio. \nNevertheless, in view of the urgent nature of the proposed Project, the Government bypassed \nthe  normal  requirement  for  a  feasibility  study  and  on  23  June  2006  approved  an  investment \nproposal (based on the recommended EAL described in the memorandum of understanding of 3 \nMay  2006).  Further,  the  Government  does  not  want  to  lose  another  construction  season  and \nhas  already  prepared  detailed  designs  for  priority  works  in  anticipation  of  commencing \nconstruction by the end of February 2007.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n33. \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  will  be  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  10  provinces  severely \naffected by typhoons in 2005 (Appendix 1). Its outcome will be rapid resumption of livelihoods \nand reduced vulnerability to natural disasters in the affected areas. This will be achieved by (i) \nreinstating  essential  infrastructure,  including  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and \nsocial  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  concurrently  providing  equivalent  or  enhanced  storm  and  flood \nprotection  to  vulnerable  areas  where  feasible.  The  project  area  encompasses  parts  of  Ha \nGiang, Ha Tinh, Nam Dinh, Nghe An, Phu Tho, Phu Yen, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, \nand Yen Bai provinces.33  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n34. \nThe Project\u2019s outputs will be rehabilitated and strengthened infrastructure in four sectors \n(i) flood protection, (ii) irrigation, (iii) roads and bridges, and (iv) social services. The Project will \nfinance (i) contracts for civil works; (ii) contracts with national consulting firms that have recently \nworked or are currently working in the affected districts for feasibility study and detailed design; \nand (iii) a contract with a team of international and national consultants for technical, social, and \nenvironmental review. The general scope of rehabilitation under the Project is shown in Table 3. \n \n\n1. \n\nComplete Feasibility Studies and Detailed Design of Subprojects \n\n35. \nOf  the  176  subprojects  proposed  for  rehabilitation  by  the  project  provinces,  105  are \nconsidered  suitable  for  inclusion  on  the  basis  of  rapid  visual  inspection.34 The  total  estimated \ncost of these, based on rough estimates of replacement cost made by the DARDs, is about $70 \nmillion. Further prioritization was made to arrive at a list of 39 core subprojects (costing about \n$49.7  million)  for  which  loan  funds  will  be  reserved.35 Each  PPC  has  confirmed  in  writing  its \nagreement  with  the  prioritization.  Given  that  the  rehabilitation  needs  in  the  project  provinces \nexceed  the  available  funds,  not  all  potentially  suitable  subprojects  can  be  financed  under  the \n\n                                                 \n32  The  need  to  align  ADB's  loan  processing  procedures  more  closely  with  those  of  the  Government  has  been \ndemonstrated  on  many  occasions.  Attempts  to  abbreviate  or  compress  the  standard  procedures  defined  in \nGovernment regulations have generally led to even greater delays than normal in reaching loan effectiveness. \n\n33  Binh Dinh province\u2019s request to be included in the Project will be considered by ADB and the Government following \n\nmore detailed review of conditions to be made during implementation.  \n\n34  Based on the information provided, these satisfy two critical selection criteria for subprojects: (i) located within the \ndefined impact area and for which the proposed rehabilitation is directly related to typhoon damage in 2005, and (ii) \nnot requiring significant land acquisition or resettlement. \n\n35  Some  of  these  subprojects  are  relatively  large  and  complex.  They  will  require  a  program  of  investigations  (e.g., \nfoundation investigations and materials testing) to support their feasibility study and redesign. Their implementation \nwould therefore extend into the second project year, with a risk of financing shortfall if funds are not reserved.  \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nProject. Hence, subprojects that are not on the priority list will be included on a first-come, first-\nserved basis. The 39 core and 66 potential subprojects are listed in Appendix 3. \n \n36. \nIn  each  of  the  10  project  provinces,  the  DARD  will  (i)  screen  and  classify  subprojects \n(and  exclude  any  classified  category  A  in  relation  to  ADB's  policies  on  environment, \nresettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples),36 (ii)  implement  public  consultations  and  carry  out  social \nanalyses  and  environmental  assessments,  (iii)  prepare  subproject  feasibility  studies  and \ndetailed  design,  and  (iv)  procure  goods,  works,  and  services  needed  for  the  Project.  Final \nacceptance of subprojects will depend on, among other aspects, absence of significant negative \nenvironmental and social impacts (para. 50).37 \n \n\nTable 3: Scope of Work \n\nComponent \n\nGeneral Scope of Work \n\nFlood Protection \n\nRehabilitate damaged sea dikes and flood protection embankments, including \nrebuilding dikes and embankments and related structures, protecting them \nagainst future recurrence of typhoons and floods, and adding protective works. \n\nIrrigation  \n\nRehabilitate and protect damaged irrigation facilities, including reinstating \ndamaged weirs, irrigation and drainage pumping stations, culverts, canals, \ndrains, river banks, reservoirs, bridges, and access roads. \n\nRoads and Bridges \n\nRehabilitate and protect damaged district and commune roads and bridges, \nincluding restoring and protecting road embankments, replacing damaged \npavements, resurfacing roads, and reinstating drainage works. \n\nSocial Services \n\nRehabilitate and protect damaged schools, water supply systems, and markets. \n\nSources: Provincial reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n \n\n37. \nThe  DARD  will  select  and  recruit  national  consulting  firms  to  undertake  the  detailed \nstudies  associated  with  these  tasks.  For  each subproject screened  as environmental  category \nB, the consultants will prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) and an environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  specific \nthe \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A  (a \ngeneric IEE for the Project is available in Supplementary Appendix B and the summary IEE is \ngiven  in  Appendix  4).  For  any  resettlement  category  B  subproject,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared in accordance with the resettlement framework (Appendix 5). If ethnic minority groups \nwill be at a disadvantage in the development process or encounter constraints on their ability to \nenjoy project benefits, an indigenous peoples development plan will be prepared in accordance \nwith  the  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  (IPDF)  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 6. \n \n\nthe  particular  subproject, \n\nfollowing \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n36  Screening of subprojects will be a continuous process and subproject classification will be reviewed on completion \nof  detailed  design.  DARD  and  the  provincial  project  management  unit  in  each  province  will  ensure  that  only \nsubprojects that are categorized as C for resettlement impact are implemented during the first year of the Project. \n37  Significant  environmental  impacts  are  those  that  would  raise  the  environmental  classification  of  the  subproject  to \ncategory  A,  requiring  the  preparation  of  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment.  Similarly,  significant  social \nimpacts  are  those  that  would  raise  the  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  classification  of  the  subproject  to \ncategory A, requiring the preparation of a full resettlement plan and/or indigenous peoples development plan. Any \nsuch  reclassified  subproject  would  be  incompatible  with  expeditious  reinstatement  of  the  infrastructure  to  be \nrehabilitated under this Project. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nAlthough  every  effort  will  be  made  to  fast-track  preparation  of  subprojects,  causes  of \n38. \nfailure  will  be  assessed  and  appropriate  means  of  overcoming  previous  design  weaknesses \nidentified. A risk and vulnerability assessment will be made for each subproject, and increased \nstandards of flood protection or flood conveyance capacity will be incorporated as appropriate. \nFor  sea  dikes,  the  DARDs  will  adhere  to  the  design  standards  developed  by  MARD\u2019s  Dike \nManagement,  Flood  and  Storm  Control  Program.  Subproject  proposals  will  be  prepared  in  a \nformat agreed to by MARD and ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplement Subprojects \n\n39. \nThe DARDs will (i) supervise construction implementation (including the incorporation of \nany  specified  environmental  mitigation  measures  and/or  specific  actions  aimed  at  mitigating \nadverse  social  impacts  and  compensating  individuals  affected  for  losses),  and  (ii)  ensure \nadherence  to  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan.  MARD  through  its  CPMU \nwill provide overall coordination and supervision of implementation.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n40. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  rapid  resumption  of  livelihoods  in  the  affected  areas  by \nreinstating essential infrastructure and services. The Project will have many positive social and \nenvironmental  impacts.  As  much  as  possible,  damaged  structures  will  be  rehabilitated  or \nreconstructed at their original sites. Hence, little land acquisition or involuntary resettlement will \nbe required. The Project is categorized as environmental category B, resettlement category B, \nand indigenous peoples category B. It will use a sector-like approach in preparing subprojects \nfor implementation. Hence, the environmental assessment procedures for sector loans will apply.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $59.9 million, including taxes and duties of \n41. \n$5.8  million (Table  4  and  Appendix  7).  The  cost  estimate  is  based  on  the  damage  and  needs \nassessment prepared by Government and ADB staff, and incorporates, as appropriate, current \nGovernment  design  standards  and  unit  cost  norms.  The  civil  works  costs  cover  the  agreed \npriority subprojects and other subprojects that will be selected during implementation (Appendix \n3).  Costs  include  an  allowance  for  project  management,  design  and  supervision,  construction \ninsurance, and consulting services. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n42. \nThe Government has requested a loan of $50.97 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  40-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 10 years, an interest rate of 1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% a \nyear for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  The  Government's  contribution  from  local  sources  will  be  $8.92  million  (Table  5). \nThe borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f12 \n\nItem \n\n \n\nTable 4: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nPriority subprojects rehabilitated \nAdditional subprojects rehabilitated \nProject implementation managed \n \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n  \na  \nb \nc   No contingencies are included in the cost estimates because the Project will follow a sector approach in \npreparing  and  implementing  subprojects.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nThe Forestry Sector Project39 is at the completion stage and the identified loan savings \n44. \nare no longer needed to achieve the project objectives. The Vocational and Technical Education \nProject40 is  59%  complete  and  the  expected  loan  closing  date  is  September  2006.  No  further \nchanges  in project  scope  are  expected.  The  savings,  which  total  SDR9.54  million  ($14  million \nequivalent) from the two loans, are attributed to savings from international consultant contracts. \n \nThe  Ho  Chi  Minh  Environmental  Improvement  Project 41  has  experienced  significant \n45. \ndelays in implementation. Since loan effectiveness in June 2000, it has achieved little progress \nin all major components. In December 2005, the executing agency proposed to cancel the solid \nwaste management subcomponent of the infrastructure improvement component. The Ministry \nof  Planning  and  Investment  then  proposed  in  January  2006  to  use  the  corresponding  loan \nsavings estimated at SDR25.21 million ($37 million equivalent) for the proposed Project. Project \ncompletion is expected by end-2008. \n \n46. \nLoan savings, if used for other purposes, would normally be canceled. The Government \nhas asked ADB to reallocate the identified loan savings to help finance the Project and to cancel \nthe amounts specified from the respective loan accounts. On 23 June 2006 the Prime Minister \napproved  the  Government's  Investment  Report  for  the  Project,  prepared  on  the  basis  of \nfinancial  and  implementation  arrangements  set  out  in  the  Mission\u2019s  memorandum  of \nunderstanding.  Concurrently,  the  Prime  Minister  confirmed  the  Government\u2019s  approval  of  the \nproposed cancellation and reallocation of loan savings.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n47. \nNational  Level.  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency.  A  Central  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU)  in  Agriculture  Projects \nManagement  Board  already  exists  within  MARD.  The  CPMU  director42 in  Hanoi  will  be  the \nproject  director.  The  CPMU  will  (i)  provide  overall  project  management  and  coordination;43 (ii) \nliaise  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  of  each  participating  province  and \ndepartment  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARD)  in  each  province  to  prepare,  select, \nand  implement  subprojects;  (iii)  provide  advice  and  project  orientation  training  to  the  DARDs; \n(iv)  coordinate  with  relevant  agencies  of  MARD  and  other  ministries  to  guide  the  DARDs  in \nrelation  to  design  standards;  (v)  help  the  DARDs  to  procure  goods  and  services  through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB), (vi) monitor progress and budgets, and prepare progress \nreports  covering  the  whole  Project  by  consolidating  the  reports  from  each  province,  and  (vii) \nprepare  the  project  completion  report.  A  team  of  international  consultants  will  help  the  CPMU \nand provincial implementing agencies to (i) undertake risk and vulnerability analyses; (ii) review \nthe financial, economic, and technical feasibility of subprojects prepared by the provinces; and \n(iii) incorporate the provisions of ADB's social and environmental safeguard policies.

The PPCs in the project provinces will be the implementing agencies \nand will, through the DARDs, select, prepare, and implement subprojects. Each DARD has set \nup a provincial project management unit (PPMU) under its direct administration to carry out the \nworks. Each PPMU will comprise a sufficient number of appropriately qualified staff and will be \nheaded by a project manager at the provincial level. Where the DARD is not directly responsible \nfor  any  particular  type  of  infrastructure,  the  PPMU  will  work  with  the  relevant  authority  (e.g., \nMARD for sea dikes and large flood protection works; provincial department of transportation for \nroads  and  bridges;  and  provincial  department  of  construction  for  urban  water  supply,  schools, \nand market facilities). \n \n49. \nSubproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Approval.  MARD  and  the  DARDs  have  prepared \nsubproject  descriptions  including  design  data,  nature  and  cause  of  damage  and  its  impact  on \neconomic activities and well-being, estimated cost of repair, and number and poverty levels of \nbeneficiaries.  Based  on  rough  estimates  of  economic  and  financial  returns,  backed  up  by  site \ninspections of representative structures, ADB and MARD made an initial selection of structures \nsuitable  for  rehabilitation.  The  respective  PPCs  and  DARDs  have  agreed  to  the  list  of  priority \nsubprojects  in  each  province  (Appendix  3),  and  the  DARDs  have  commenced  preparing  their \nfeasibility studies and detailed design. All subprojects are required to meet the following criteria: \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nOnly  subprojects  damaged  by  the  2005  series  of  typhoons  and  tropical  storms \nwill be considered for inclusion in the Project. \nPotential  subprojects  with  unacceptable  environmental  or  social  impacts  or \nsignificant resettlement may not be included.44 \nNo  subprojects  will  be  located  within  or  adjacent  to  designated  protected  or \nconservation  areas  and  their  buffer  zones,  nor  will  any  subproject  change  the \ncourse  of  a  river  or  alter  river  characteristics  in  a  significant  way,  or  have  the \npotential to make significant changes in the surrounding environment. \nRehabilitation  is  technically  feasible,  cost-effective,  financially  viable,  and \nsustainable,  and  represents  a  least-cost  alternative,  while  incorporating  natural \ndisaster risk reduction measures where necessary and feasible.45 \nA  subproject  may  only  be  considered  if  the  PPC  has  an  operation  and \nmaintenance  plan  for  the  subproject  and  provides  an  assurance  of  annual \noperation and maintenance budget (exclusive of any beneficiary contribution that \nmay be negotiated during subproject selection and preparation). \nOnly subprojects for which the contracted works can be completed during project \nimplementation may be considered. \nPotential subprojects will be excluded if the estimated construction cost exceeds \nthe original estimate by more than 15% unless otherwise agreed between CPMU \nand ADB.46  \nPartial  financing  of  a  subproject  from  sources  other  than  the  loan  and  related \nGovernment  counterpart  funding  is  permissible  provided  the  amounts  and \nsources  of  all  such  external  funding  are  clearly  and  transparently  presented  as \npart of the financing plan and submitted to ADB for approval. \n\n                                                 \n44  ADB.  1995.  Involuntary  Resettlement.  Manila  defines  resettlement  as  \u201csignificant\u201d  where  200  or  more  people \nexperience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as involving affected people being physically displaced from \nhousing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n\n45  Distributional analyses will be made to determine the nature and impact of all positive and negative impacts, and \n\nthe results will be used to improve subproject prioritization and thereby increase project benefits for the poor. \n\n46  In  case  of  cost  overrun,  the  subproject  may  be  retained  subject  to  the  PPC\u2019s  agreement  to  meet  the  full  cost  of \n\noverrun from provincial or other sources.  \n\n\f15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\nNo subproject costing less than $200,000 equivalent will be eligible for financing \nunder the Project.47  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 30 months from the date of loan effectiveness, with \n50. \nan  anticipated  completion  date  of  30  June  2009  (Appendix  8). 48 Construction  activities  will \ncommence immediately following loan effectiveness, anticipated by January 2007. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n51. \nCivil works and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines  (2006). 49 State-owned  enterprises  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are \nlegally  and  financially  autonomous,  independent  from  MARD  and  the  DARDs,  and  operate  on \nthe basis of commercial law and practice.50 Civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $2 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  ADB's  standard  bidding  documents  for  the \nprocurement  of  works  (large  contracts)  will  be  used.  Prequalification  will  only  be  required  for \nlarge or complex subprojects as determined by ADB at the feasibility study phase. Procurement \nusing  ICB  procedures  requires  prior  ADB  review  of  invitations  to  bid,  bidding  documents,  and \nbid evaluation reports. The bidding period will be 42 days for ICB contracts. \n \nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through \n52. \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. The Government's standard bidding documents \nand procedures will be used if these comply closely with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2006). \nPostqualification  or  the  national  contractor's  registration/classification  system  will  be  used  for \nNCB  contracts.  The  bidding  period  will  be  21  days.  Prior  review  by  ADB  of  invitations  to  bid, \nbidding documents, and bid evaluation reports will be required for the first NCB contract in each \nprovince. Subsequently, retroactive approval procedures will be followed. If for any reason ADB \ndoes  not  approve  the  award  or  terms  of  contract,  the  Government  will  use  its  own  funds  to \nfinance the contract or to refund to ADB any payments already made from loan funds for that \ncontract. A procurement plan is shown in Appendix 9. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  a  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  help  the \n53. \nCPMU  and  PPMUs  carry  out  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  and  review  the  technical, \nsocial,  and  environmental  soundness  of  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  prepared  by \nnational  consulting  firms.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  the  CPMU  and  DARDs  to  ensure \nadherence to ADB's policies and guidelines during implementation. The consultants will provide \n60  person-months  of  national  and  27  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs. \nExpertise  will  be  required  in  natural  disaster  risk  assessment;  engineering  investigations  and \ndesign  of  hydraulic  structures,  irrigation  systems,  roads,  bridges,  sea  dikes,  and  flood \nembankments;  geotechnical  engineering;  economic  and  financial  analyses;  and  social  and \nenvironmental  aspects.  MARD  will  select  and  engage  a  firm  of  international  consultants  using \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  biodata  technical  proposals,  in  accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006).  \n \n\n                                                 \n47  Nevertheless,  small  works  may  be  grouped  into  a  larger  subproject  if  practical  reasons  can  be  found  to  do  so \n\n(same subsector, geographical area, nature of work, etc.). \n\n48  No new contract awards or commitments (including contract variations) will be allowed after the completion date. \n49  Procurement of goods is not envisaged under this Project. \n50  ADB  has  advised  the  Government  that  all  companies  operating  directly  under  the  supervisory  authority  of  the \nexecuting  agency  or  any  implementing  agency  of  an  ADB-financed  project  will  be  excluded  from  participating. \nOther state-owned enterprises will be allowed only if they are equitized and operate under the Enterprise Law. \n\n\f16 \n\nThe  CPMU  may  engage  consultants,  either  as  individuals  or  as  a  firm,  to  assist  with \n54. \npreparatory  activities,  and  the  DARDs  will  engage  consulting  firms  to  help  prepare  feasibility \nstudies  and  detailed  designs  of  subprojects,  complete  contract  documentation  of  works,  help \nsupervise  construction,  and  monitor  performance.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of  the  works, \nthe  short  construction  period  prior  to  the  next  typhoon  season,  and  the  relative  simplicity  of \nmany of the works, ADB has agreed that, for contracts not exceeding $100,000, single-source \nselection in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006) may be used \nto select national consulting firms.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB's  anticorruption  policy51 was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  MARD.  Consistent \n55. \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the \nright  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's \nanticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MARD \nand  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \nProject. To deter corruption and increase transparency, procurement related information will be \ndisclosed at a dedicated Government website. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nGiven  the  urgency  of  the  Project,  ADB  Management  approved  advance  action  and \n56. \nretroactive  financing  for  the  selection  of  international  and  national  consulting  firms.  Selection \nmay  be  carried  out  and  contracts  awarded  to  international  and  national  consulting  firms  for \npreparatory work and feasibility studies and detailed design of subprojects (Appendix 3) prior to \nthe date of loan effectiveness, provided that such selection and awarding process is carried out \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). Should MARD or any of \nthe  DARDs  sign  a  contract  with  a  selected  firm  prior  to  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will assume entire responsibility for any payments due under the contract. In such \nloan \ncases  and  upon  MARD\u2019s  request,  ADB  will  give  consideration,  subsequent \neffectiveness, to retroactive reimbursement of payments made to the consulting firm, subject to \nADB's  review  of  the  selection  procedures  and  confirmation  through  due  diligence  that  any \nincurred expenditure has been appropriately used. Retroactive payment may not exceed 20% of \nthe  total  loan  amount.  The  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing of the Project.  \n \n\nto \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n57. \nThe  Government  will  open  a  first-generation  imprest  account  in  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB, into which the ADB loan funds will be deposited, in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), updated from time to time. Similarly, each of the \nproject  provinces  will  establish  a  second-generation  imprest  account,  in  a  bank  acceptable  to \nADB,  for  local  project  expenditures.  The  total  combined  advances  in  the  first-  and  second-\ngeneration imprest accounts at any time during project implementation will not be greater than \nthe  estimated  expenditure  for  the  coming  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower.  The  ceiling  of  the  second-generation  imprest  account  in  each  province  will  be  the \nestimated  local  expenditure  for  the  coming  6  months  or  $1,000,000,  whichever  is  lower. \n\n                                                 \n51  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nPayments to civil works contractors will be made directly by ADB, or from the imprest accounts \nas appropriate (a fund flow arrangement is provided in Supplementary Appendix D). The CPMU \nwill  make  all  ICB  disbursements  from  the  first-generation  imprest  account.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure will apply to contracts not exceeding $100,000. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58. \nThe  CPMU  will  monitor  and  consolidate  accounts  for  each  province  and  prepare  a \nseparate account for the Project as a whole. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the CPMU \nwill  establish  a  computerized  management  information  system  suited  to  the  financial \nmanagement and reporting needs of the Project. A qualified firm will be recruited to audit project \naccounts annually. The audited accounts and auditor's report (including the auditor\u2019s opinion on \nthe  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  operations)  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not \nmore than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n59. \nEach  agency  directly  involved  in  the  Project  (MARD  and  the  DARDs)  will  prepare \nprogress reports every 6 months and submit them within 1 month to the CPMU for consolidation \nand submission to ADB. The reports will describe progress in achieving design and monitoring \nframework  targets  (Appendix  2),  any  problems  encountered  and  steps  taken  to  resolve  them, \nand activities for the next reporting period. MARD will prepare and submit a project completion \nreport in standard ADB format not more than 6 months after physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  CPMU  will  be  responsible  for  setting  up  an  appropriate  system  to  monitor  and \n60. \nevaluate  project  performance  and  impact  as  part  of  MARD\u2019s  management  information  system \nwith  assistance  from  the  project  implementation  consultants.  Project  performance  monitoring \nand  evaluation  will  refer  to  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  2).  Baseline \nindicators  and  targets  for  each  subproject  will  be  developed  by  ADB  staff,  the  CPMU,  and \nDARDs prior to implementation. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n61. \nADB  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews,  facilitated  by  MARD,  to  (i)  examine  the \nappropriateness  of  implementation  arrangements  and  schedules  of  activities,  including  funds \nflow;  (ii)  review  compliance  with  agreed  procurement  procedures;  and  (iii)  monitor  the \neffectiveness of safeguard procedures.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Benefits and Impacts \n\n62. \nAbout  450,000  residents  of  remote  areas  of  the  project  provinces  will  benefit  directly \nfrom  improved  access  to  markets,  schools,  and  other  services;  rapid  resumption  of  income-\nearning activities; and greater security from natural disasters. In the 39 priority subprojects, the \nProject  will  reinstate  (i)  about  64  km  of  irrigation  canals  (including  21  diversion  structures) \nserving more than 11,000 ha of irrigated land; (ii)  112 km of rural roads (including 67 culverts \nand 5 bridges); (iii) about 13 km of sea dikes and 17 km of flood protection embankments; and \n(iv) schools, markets, and rural water supply schemes. Rehabilitated structures will have higher \nresistance  to  floods,  storm  surge,  waves,  and  other  typhoon-related  impacts  (including  larger \nconveyance capacity for bridges and better slope protection on sea dikes and flood protection \nembankments),  based  on  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments.  The  causes  of  failure  will  be \n\n\f18 \n\nexamined to ensure better design standards where necessary, and the completed works will be \nintegrated into a database linked to provincial disaster preparedness plans. \n \n63. \nSignificant  resettlement  impacts  are  not  expected  because  most  of  the  rehabilitation \nwork  will  be  done  within  the  existing  right-of-way  of  the  damaged  infrastructure.  Acquisition  of \nsome small areas of land may be needed where infrastructure cannot be reinstated within the \noriginal  site.  This  may  occur  if  the  site  has  been  eroded  or  otherwise  rendered  unsuitable,  an \nalternative nearby site offers greater security in terms of future flood events, or sound technical \nand  financial  reasons  are  given  for  selecting  another  site.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed on a resettlement framework that sets out the compensation and other entitlements for \nany unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement impacts in accordance the Government\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.52 The Project is \nclassified category B. Short resettlement plans will be prepared for any subproject found to have \nresettlement impacts up to the limits of category B. \n \n64. \nA high proportion of the ethnic minority groups will be affected in the subproject areas in \nHa  Giang,  Yen  Bai,  and  Phu  Tho  provinces.  The  Project  is  designed  to  ensure  that  all \ncommunities will benefit from the Project on an equitable basis. The Government and ADB have \nagreed  to  an  IPDF  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Government  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples.53 The IPDF provides a policy framework \nto  screen  impacts  of  the  subprojects,  and  accordingly,  to  prepare  an  appropriate  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  or  specific  actions  for  the  subprojects  affecting  ethnic  minority \ngroups. The Project is classified category B for indigenous peoples. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n65.  While  the  Project  may  lead  to  temporary  and  reversible  localized  negative  impacts,  no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen,  and  the  Project  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category B. A generic IEE was prepared to identify potential impacts, appropriate \nmitigation  measures,  and  suitable  monitoring  mechanisms  (Supplementary  Appendix  B). \nSubprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures  stipulated  in  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy54 (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  IEEs \nwill be prepared for all category B subprojects. Although no environmental impact assessment is \ncurrently required, this will be reexamined during detailed design. \n \nC. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n66. \nSome  large  or  complex  subprojects  will  require  investigations  (e.g.,  foundation \ninvestigations) to support their feasibility and design studies. Their implementation could extend \nbeyond the project completion date. To avoid the risk of noncompletion of any such subprojects, \nthey will be assessed within the first 6 months of project implementation. Only those that can be \ncompleted within  the  implementation  period  will  be  retained.  The  risk  of cost  overrun  for  large \nsubprojects will be minimized by ensuring careful cost estimation at the design stage. Project-\nfinanced  international  consultants  will  help  the  CPMU  and  DARDs  to  review  bills  of  quantities \nand cost estimates at the detailed design stage. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n52  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nFor greater safety and typhoon resistance, sea dikes may have to be set back from the \n67. \nseashore when they are rehabilitated. This would involve significant land use change and could \nlead  to  those  subprojects  being  classified  as  category  A  for  resettlement  impacts,  effectively \nremoving  them  from  the  Project.55 Under  such  a  scenario,  alternative  subprojects  would  be \nselected  from  among  those  identified  by  the  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission,  and \npossibly also from among those that have not yet been inspected. To avoid the risk of having \nunsuitable subprojects financed by the Project, the selection criteria will be strictly adhered to, \nrequiring vigilance and close scrutiny on the part of MARD and ADB administration staff. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MARD  have  given  the \n\n68. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nthat  each \nProvincial  project  management  units.  MARD  will  ensure \nparticipating  DARD  sets  up  a  PPMU  and  provides  in  it,  for  the  duration  of  the \nProject,  a  project  manager,  social  and  environment  sectors  coordinator, \neconomist,  accounting  and  financial  management  staff,  and  engineering  and \ntechnical  staff  consistent  with  the  number  and  complexity  of  subprojects  to  be \nmanaged, to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nSelection  of  subprojects.  MARD  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet,  to  the \nimplementation \nsatisfaction  of  ADB, \narrangements,  and  that  all  subprojects  incorporate  measures  to  enhance  their \nresistance to typhoon damage based on risk and vulnerability analyses. \n\nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and \n\nResettlement.  MARD  will  ensure  that  only  subprojects  whose  resettlement \nimpacts remain within the limits of a category B subproject will be financed by the \nProject,  and  that  only  subprojects  that  are  category  C  with  respect  to \nresettlement impact will be implemented during the first year of implementation. \nMARD  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be \nimplemented in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of Viet Nam \nand the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (as reflected in \nthe  resettlement  framework  in  Appendix  5).  Subproject  resettlement  plans, \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  given  in  Appendix  5,  will  be \ndisclosed to people affected prior to submitting to ADB for review. Approval of the \nresettlement  plan  by  ADB  will  be  a  precondition  to  award  of  contracts  for  civil \nworks  in  such  cases.  MARD  will  ensure  that  a  qualified  social  science  or  other \nsuitably  qualified  institution  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  contracted  to  conduct \nindependent external monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement process and \nimpacts. \n\nCommunity  participation. MARD  will ensure that the DARDs actively promote \nimplementation,  and \ncommunity  participation \nperformance monitoring of subprojects. Tender documents will include provisions \nto  ensure  contractors'  preferential  hiring  of  local  labor,  to  guarantee  equal \nopportunities for female workers to work with the principle of equal pay for work \nof equal value, and to prevent employment of child labor. \n\nin  selection,  preparation, \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n55  Sea dike subprojects represent a total cost of about $22 million within the project cost of $60 million. \n\n\fIndigenous  people. MARD will ensure that subprojects will not adversely affect \nindigenous  peoples,  households  headed  by  women,  disabled,  elderly,  or  other \nsimilarly vulnerable groups. In the event that indigenous people are affected by or \nare beneficiaries of any subproject, MARD will ensure that their rights and needs \nare fully respected in compliance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples and in \naccordance with the IPDF (Supplementary Appendix C). \n\nAward  of  civil  works.  The  Government  will  not  award  any  Works  contracts \nfinanced  under  the  Loan  until  (i)  the  Resettlement  Plan  for  the  Subproject  is \napproved  by  ADB;  and  (ii)  all  resettlement  activities  have  been  completed  and \nrelated  compensation  payments,  replacement  of  assets  or  other  assistance  for \nthe  affected  people  are  delivered  prior  to  the  dispossession  or  displacement  of \nthe  affected  people  in  accordance  with  the  Resettlement  Plan  or  other \nrequirements relating to resettlement and vulnerable groups, as applicable. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following conditions will be satisfied prior to loan effectiveness: \n\nThe  project  implementation,  financial  management,  and  auditing  arrangements \nwill have been developed and documented in an operation manual in substance \nand form satisfactory to ADB, and the arrangements for the flow of funds under \nthe Project will be approved by MARD.  \n\nEach  DARD  will  have  set  up  and  staffed  a  PPMU  with  a  project  manager, \nsocial/environmental  sectors  coordinator,  economist,  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement staff, and engineering and technical staff to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe cancellation and reallocation of loan funds will have been completed. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n70. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 34,733,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity \nDamage Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum; a term of 40  years, including a grace period of 10 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nwaiver of the 12-week period stipulated for processing of emergency assistance \nloans under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004). \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii)  \n\n20 \n\n \nB. \n\n69. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n30 October 2006 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fAppendix 1     21 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions and Risks  \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n \nSustained economic \ngrowth in areas affected \nby the 2005 typhoons \n\nOutcome \n \nRapid resumption of \nlivelihoods and reduced \nvulnerability to natural \ndisasters in the affected \nareas \n\n \n \nEconomic growth rates for \naffected districts \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRural infrastructure \nconstructed and repaired \nto agreed flood-resistance \ndesign standards \n \nImproved access to \nschools, markets, and \nother services \n \nReduced loss of life and \ndamage in future storm \nseasons \n \n\n \n \nReports of the Government \nStatistics Office \n \nProvincial and district \nstatistics covering economic \nactivities and poverty \n \n \nAnnual reports of the \nprovincial departments of \nagriculture and rural \ndevelopment (DARDs) in \neach project province \n \nProject completion report \nprepared by the Central \nProject Management Unit \n(CPMU) in the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (MARD) \n \nSchool enrollments and \nhealth clinic records \n \nDamage assessments of the \nCentral Committee for Flood \nand Storm Control (CCFSC) \n \nAnnual reports of the \nprovincial departments of \ntransportation and \nconstruction \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

With  the  assistance  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD) \nand  its  provincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs),  the  Mission \nvisited 10 of the most severely affected provinces.2  \n \n2. \nThe  Mission  did  not  provide  for  public  consultation,  but  extensive  meetings  and \ndiscussions  were  held  with  national  and  local  government  officials  in  each  of  the  provinces, \nincluding  provincial  people's  committees  (PPCs)  and  district  and  commune  people\u2019s \ncommittees. Interviews were carried out with selected communities on-site during the field visits. \nThe  damage  caused  by  the  2005  natural  disasters  had  serious  impacts  on  the  lives  of  those \naffected. Across the spectrum of government  officials and local communities there was strong \nsupport for rapid rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure as a means of restoring livelihoods and \npromoting general well-being in the communities.  \n \nThe  Mission  reached  agreement  with  the  Government,  MARD,  and  the  provincial \n3. \nagencies  on  (i)  technical,  financial,  social,  environmental,  and  legal  aspects  of  the  proposed \nProject; (ii) institutional and financing arrangements for an emergency assistance loan, including \nthe fund flow mechanism and associated auditing; and (iii) appropriate undertakings on the part \nof the Government, Executing Agency (MARD), and provincial agencies. The Mission's findings \nand  agreements  reached  with  the  Government  were  recorded  in  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding signed by the Government on 3 May 2006.  \n \nB. \n\nTyphoons and Related Phenomena in 2005 \n\nAccording  to  the  Benfield  Hazard  Research  Centre,3 the  2005  northwest  Pacific  storm \n4. \nseason was average.4 The major tropical storms and typhoons affecting Viet Nam in 2005 are \nlisted in Table A2.1. \n \n5. \nTyphoon  Damrey.  The  most  violent  and  damaging  typhoon  in  2005  (and  Viet  Nam's \nworst  in  10  years)  was  Damrey.5 The  typhoon-affected  coastal  provinces  from  Quang  Ninh  in \nthe  north  to  Quang  Nam  and  Da  Nang  in  the  south,  and  caused  a  sea  run-up  of  3\u20134  meters \nduring high tides. Occurring shortly after the less severe tropical storm Vicente had weakened \nsea  defenses,  Damrey  destroyed  primary  dikes  in  Thinh  Long  town,  Hai  Hau  district  in  Nam \nDinh province, and Hau Loc district in Thanh Hoa.

More  than \n130,000  ha  of  rice  fields  were  flooded  beyond  recovery.  Many  roads,  electricity  distribution \nfacilities,  and  irrigation  schemes  were  damaged.  Thousands  of  classrooms  were  flooded, \ncausing the loss of school books and other materials; the number of children unable to attend \nschool for several days was in the hundreds of thousands. By 29 September 2005, when many \nevacuees  (mostly  adults)  returned  to  their  homes,  destroyed  crops  and  aquaculture  ponds \nmeant  that  they  had  no  immediate  means  of  support  or  livelihood.  Many  houses  were  still \nsubmerged and most livestock had been lost.  \n \nHeavy rain again occurred on 6\u22127 October 2005, causing thousands of people to flee to \n8. \nhigher ground when more than 44,000 houses were flooded in central Viet Nam\u2019s mountainous \nQuang  Binh,  Quang  Tri,  and  Thua  Thien  Hue  provinces.  Flash  floods  destroyed  21,515  ha  of \nrice  and  thousands  of  hectares  of  vegetable  farms,  killed  livestock,  and  destroyed  fish  ponds. \nVinh Linh, Cam Lo, and Gio Linh districts in Quang Tri province were the hardest hit. Most wells \nwere contaminated by seawater and many communities were without food. \n \n9. \nTyphoon  Kaitak.  Typhoon  Kaitak  struck  on  28  October  2005  and  caused  severe \ndamage in provinces that had experienced flooding only a few weeks earlier (Da Nang, Quang \nBinh,  Quang  Nam,  Quang  Ngai,  Quang  Tri,  and  Thua  Thien  Hue).  Kaitak  claimed  19  lives, \ninjured  44,  and  left  another  11  unaccounted  for.  It  swept  away  9,000  houses  and  flooded  an \nadditional  46,000  houses  and  206  classrooms.  Floods  covered  13,000  ha  of  rice  and  other \ncrops,  and  57  ships  were  blown  out  to  sea.  The  storm  washed  out  sections  of  roads  and \nirrigation works, removing an estimated 1.1 million cubic meters of soil. From 4\u221223 December \n2005, more heavy rains and flash floods hit the central provinces of Binh Dinh, Dac Lak, Khanh \nHoa,  Phu  Yen,  Quang  Nam,  Quang  Ngai,  and  Thua  Thien  Hue.  The  total  death  toll  was  61 \npeople. Hundreds of houses collapsed as a result of landslides and coastal erosion.  \n \nC. \n\nSummary Damage and Needs Assessment \n\nSocial  Impacts.  The  2005  typhoons  and  storms  in  Viet  Nam  struck  many  provinces, \n10. \nsome  of  them  repeatedly,  over  7  months;  and  damaged  infrastructure  and  services  in  a \n\n                                                 \n6   As many as 600,000 families were evacuated. Only five people died and three were injured.  \n\n \n\n\f           Appendix 2      25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmultitude of sites scattered over a large area. Many types of infrastructure that are critical to the \nlivelihoods  of  poor  rural  households  were  destroyed.  These  are  mostly  small-scale  and  within \nthe  authority  of  provincial  agencies.7 Flash  floods  swept  away  bridges  and  sections  of  roads. \nRainfall-induced landslides also cut off roads and carried away houses and other vital property, \nincluding  large  tracts  of  terraced  agricultural  land  and  irrigation  systems.  Productive  land \nadjacent  to  many  rivers  was  covered  by  river-borne  sediment.  Flood  protection  infrastructure \nwas lost, leaving rural communities in a heightened state of vulnerability. The breaching of sea \ndikes  led  to  seawater  inundation  of  coastal  plains  used  for  rice  farming  and  aquaculture,  and \nrendered these areas at greater risk of flooding during even moderate storms. The consequent \nloss of economic opportunities is a significant burden to the poor\u2014they now also suffer in terms \nof access to markets, schools, services, and clean water. The typhoons and storms also had a \ndeleterious impact on natural resources, which are the main sources of income for the poor. \n \n11. \nEconomic  Impacts. In the northern inland provinces (Bac Giang, Bac Kan, Ha Giang, \nLao  Cai,  Phu  Tho,  Son  La,  and  Yen  Bai),  flash  floods,  landslides,  and  embankment  collapse \nwere  the  predominant  impacts.  In  the  central  and  northern  coastal  provinces  (Ha  Tinh,  Nam \nDinh, Nghe An, Quang Nam, Quang Ninh, Quang Tri, Thai Binh, and Thanh Hoa), the damage \nwas due to direct typhoon impact (e.g., destruction of sea dikes by wave action and seawater \ninundation of coastal areas as a result of storm surge) and extensive flooding of low-lying areas. \nThe  Central  Committee  for  Flood  and  Storm  Control  estimated  the  cost  of  damage  to \ninfrastructure in affected provinces to be equivalent to $365 million (Table A2.2).8 \n \n12. \npreparedness and response to Damrey were efficient:  \n \n \n \n\nGovernment's  Response.  A  joint  assessment9 found  that  the  Government's  disaster \n\nTyphoon warnings were provided to all people at risk several days in advance. \nThe  Central  Committee  for  Flood  and  Storm  Control  issued  instructions  for \nfishing  vessels  and  boats  to  return  to  safe  havens10 and  for  farmers  to  harvest \ncrops where possible before the typhoon.  \nInstructions  were  given  on  evacuation  plans 11  and  emergency  measures \nimplemented to protect sea dikes likely to be affected. \nMore  than  311,000  people  were  evacuated  from  vulnerable  areas  by  26 \nSeptember 2005 (the day before the typhoon struck). \nMany  sections  of  the  sea  dikes  damaged  by  tropical  storm  Vicente  were \ntemporarily strengthened before Damrey struck land. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7   Except for primary sea dikes funded by the central Government through MARD. \n8   This  estimate  excludes  damage  to  sea  dikes  (estimated  at  $650  million\u2013$700  million)  and  flood  protection \n\nembankments under central Government authority. \n\n9  Report  of  the  joint  assessment  by  a  team  fielded  through  the  Disaster  Management  Working  Group  immediately \nafter the storm. Representatives from Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control, International Federation of \nthe  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies,  MARD,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Oxfam  Great  Britain,  United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund, and United Nations Development Programme. \n\n10  More than 40,000 fishing ships and boats were secured in harbors before the typhoon reached Viet Nam. \n11  Temporary relocation of families is a common emergency response during the typhoon season. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nDamage Category \n\nTable A2.2: Cumulative Impact of Typhoons and Storms in 2005 \n\nUnit \n\n \n\nPeople \n  Adult deaths \n  Child deaths \n  People injured \n  People missing \nHouses \n  Collapsed and washed away \n  Flooded and damaged \nSchools \n  Collapsed and washed away \n  Flooded and damaged \nHospitals and Clinics \n  Collapsed and washed away \n  Flooded and damaged \nOther Infrastructure (community facilities) \n  Flooded and damaged \nAgriculture \n  Area of flooded rice \n  \u2013 area of complete loss \n  Area of flooded vegetables \n  \u2013 area of complete loss \n  Destroyed seed stock \n  Area of damaged industrial trees \n  Buffalo and cow deaths \n  Pig deaths \n  Poultry deaths \nIrrigation \n  Collapsed and washed away \n  Flooded and damaged \n  Damaged small irrigation schemes \nTransportation (road embankments, structures) \n  Collapsed and washed away (earth fill) \n  Collapsed and washed away (rock fill) \n  Collapsed and washed away bridges and culverts \n  Damaged bridges and culverts \n  Length of damaged roads \nAquaculture (ponds, fish cages, boats, equipment) \n  Damaged ponds \n  Fish cages lost \n  Loss of fish and prawn production \n  Ships lost \nCommunication Facilities \n  Collapsed pylons and towers \n  Broken cables \nPower Transmission \n  Broken high tension line \n  Broken low tension line \n  Broken power line \n \n \na Excluding the cost of sea dikes and flood protection embankments. \nSource: Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control. \n\n \nnumber \nnumber \nnumber \nnumber \n \nnumber \nnumber \n \nrooms \nrooms \n \nnumber \nnumber \n \nnumber \n \nhectares \nhectares \nhectares \nhectares \ntons \nhectares \nnumber \nnumber \nnumber \n \ncubic meters \nkilometers \nnumber \n \ncubic meters \ncubic meters \nnumber \nnumber \nkilometers \n \nhectares \nnumber \nton \nnumber \n \nnumber \nnumber \n \nmeters \nmeters \nmeters \n \n$ million \n\nTotal Estimated Damage \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n377 \n49 \n262 \n22 \n\n7,586 \n215,685 \n\n258 \n4,587 \n\n198 \n52 \n\n246 \n\n504,099 \n30,373 \n160,781 \n1,710 \n1,128 \n26,171 \n1,629 \n6,708 \n131,747 \n\n2,987,900 \n\n166.5 \n750 \n\n3,417,240 \n2,940 \n260 \n160 \n1,089 \n\n55,693 \n124 \n3,663 \n381 \n\n7,181 \n40,780 \n\n663 \n7,148 \n62,317 \n \n365a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n           Appendix 2      27 \n\n \n\n \n13. \nThe Government's early warnings and emergency measures prevented large loss of life; \nand the provision of food, shelter, and other essentials to families evacuated from their homes \nor  otherwise  deprived  of  normal  means  of  livelihood  by  the  events  was  timely.  As  typhoon \nDamrey  approached,  the  Government  released  about  $12.5  million  to  cover  preparations \nincluding  transport,  life  jackets,  and  materials  for  dike  strengthening.  Officials  remained  in  the \nmost vulnerable areas throughout the typhoon to direct operations, and as the storm weakened, \nstaff  from  line  ministries  worked  with  provincial  agencies  to  assess  relief  and  rehabilitation \nneeds.  Local  governments  and  nongovernment  organizations  provided  emergency  food  to \npeople and organized voluntary services to rescue people, and temporarily raise and strengthen \nsea  dikes.  The  National  Red  Cross  provided  cash  and  essential  rations  to  households  in  Hai \nPhong, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, and Thanh Hoa provinces.  \n \n14. \nDuring  and  following  the  2005  typhoons  and  tropical  storms,  the  Government  ensured \nthat  all  people  who  lost  houses  were  provided  with  shelter\u2014in  many  cases  new  houses.  All \nmajor  transport  networks  and  essential  social  infrastructure  (especially  water  supply  systems, \nhealth centers, schools, and utilities) were reinstated, although many only in a temporary way. \n \n15. \nA  deficiency  in  the  Government's  damage  estimation  is  its  recording  of  the  impacts  of \nindividual  events  rather  than  the  cumulative  effects  of  typhoons  and  storms  recurring  several \ntimes  within  the  overall  season  in  certain  areas.  For  example,  damage  caused  by  typhoon \nWashi  and  tropical  storm  Vicente  weakened  critical  protective  works  immediately  prior  to \ntyphoon  Damrey.  As  a  result,  Damrey  caused  far  more  damage  than  would  normally  have \noccurred from such an event.  \n \n16. \nGovernment  Capacity.  The  Government  invests  heavily  in  preparedness,  immediate \nhumanitarian response, social well-being, and restoration of essential strategic infrastructure in \ndisaster-prone  areas  (including  an  ongoing  program  to  build,  reinforce,  and  repair  sea  dikes \nextending  along  2,000  kilometers  of  coastline).  Even  in  average  years,  however,  the \nGovernment\u2019s contingency budget12 has a significant financing gap for rehabilitation of damage \ncaused by natural disasters. Damage from natural disasters in 2003 and 2004 was estimated at \nonly about $100 million per annum, but a shortfall of $46 million\u2212$130 million occurred.13 Other \nunexpected needs, such as the Government's response to avian influenza, diverted large sums \nfrom  the  contingency  budgets.  Such  shortfalls  severely  limit  disaster  recovery  and  impact  on \neconomic development in poor areas. Hence, already poor areas could fall deeper into poverty. \nIn addition, many of the structures are being or will be reinstated in a temporary manner due to \nthe  heavy  demand  on  contingency  funds.  Such  repairs  are  of  inadequate  quality  and  do  not \nprovide improved disaster resistance or mitigation measures.14 \n \nD. \n\nConclusions \n\n17. \nThe  Mission  concluded  that  ADB  emergency  assistance  is  needed  to  help  the \nGovernment reinstate damaged infrastructure and services, ensure adequate quality and design \nstandard  to  withstand  typhoons,  and  implement  appropriate  preparedness  and  mitigation \nmeasures within a natural disaster management strategy.  \n\n                                                 \n12  Article  9(1)  of  the  Government  Law  on  State  Budget  allows  for  2%\u22125%  of  the  national  budget  to  be  used  for \n\ncontingency spending. \n\n13  World  Bank.  2005.

The  Project  will  (i)  reinstate \nessential  infrastructure,  including  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure; and (ii) concurrently provide equivalent or enhanced storm and flood protection to \nvulnerable areas where feasible. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken and \ngeneric environmental impacts for each component were assessed based on field visits to sites \nrepresentative  of  the  proposed  priority  subprojects.  The  IEE  findings  show  that  the  overall \nimpact of the Project will be positive. The Project is categorized as environmental category B.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Description  \n\nThe Project will use a sector approach in preparing subprojects for implementation and \n2. \nthe  environmental  assessment  procedures  for  sector  loans  will  apply.  Subprojects  for \nrehabilitation  will  be  selected  from  among  those  inspected  during  the  Damage  and  Needs \nAssessment  Mission  (March\u2013April  2006),  at  which  time  105  subprojects  were  considered \nsuitable  on  the  basis  of  rapid  visual  inspection. 1 Thirty-nine  priority  subprojects  have  been \nidentified.  The  scale  of  rehabilitation  work  in  each  subproject  is  mostly  small  (less  than  $1 \nmillion  equivalent) 2 and  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  mostly  minor  and  easily \nmitigated. The project area encompass parts of Ha Giang, Ha Tinh, Nam Dinh, Nghe An, Phu \nTho, Phu Yen, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, and Yen Bai provinces. \n \n3. \nThe Project is prepared as an emergency assistance loan to ensure prompt restoration \nof  services  to  the  population.  Thus,  the  IEE  represents  the  initial  scoping  of  environmental \nimpacts and anticipated mitigation measures. A final screening of subprojects will be based on \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  that  take  into  account  any  adverse  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  discerned  from  social  analyses  and  consultations  with  individuals \naffected.  Final  acceptance  of  subprojects  will  depend  on,  among  other  things,  absence  of \nsignificant negative environmental and social impacts.3 \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nViet Nam has a tropical monsoonal climate with frequent typhoons affecting the northern \n4. \nand central regions. The temperatures are subtropical in the north and tropical monsoon in the \ncentral region. Rainfall intensity can be high, producing both extensive flooding in the deltas of \nthe Red and Mekong river basins, and flash floods in mountainous regions and along the central \ncoast.  Both  the  north  and  central  regions  experience  an  annual  rainfall  of  1,800\u20132,500 \n\n                                                 \n1   Based on the information provided, these satisfy two critical selection criteria for subprojects: (i) located within the \ndefined impact area and for which the proposed rehabilitation is directly related to typhoon damage in 2005, and \n(ii) not requiring significant land acquisition or resettlement. \n\n2   Four sections of sea dike/flood protection are estimated to cost in the range of $3.4 million\u2013$8.5 million each. \n3   Significant  environmental  impacts  are  those  that  would  raise  the  environmental  classification  of  the  subproject  to \ncategory  A,  requiring  the  preparation  of  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment.  Similarly,  significant  social \nimpacts  are  those  that  would  raise  the  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  classification  of  the  subproject  to \ncategory A, requiring the preparation of a full resettlement plan and/or indigenous peoples development plan. Any \nsuch  reclassified  subproject  would  be  incompatible  with  expeditious  reinstatement  of  the  infrastructure  to  be \nrehabilitated under this Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4     33 \n\nmillimeters,  distributed  unevenly  through  the  year.  Approximately  70%  of  the  rainfall  occurs \nduring the main wet season from May to September/October.  \n \n5. \nThe northern region is characterized by mountainous or hilly terrain except for the Red \nRiver  valley  and  coastal  plain,  making  this  region  extremely  vulnerable  to  floods  and  other \nnatural  hazards.  Along  the  central  Viet  Nam  coastal  plains  the  rivers  are  short  and  steep. \nStorms  frequently  produce  flash  floods,  which  are  a  serious  hazard  for  the  population \nconcentrated  within  the  alluvial  floodplains.  This  area  also  suffers  from  severe  droughts.  On \naverage,  4\u22126  typhoons  reach  Viet  Nam  each  year.  They  raise  sea  levels,  often  by  several \nmeters,  and  cause  extensive  loss  of  land  through  wave-induced  erosion.  The  resultant  storm \nsurges  extend  for  considerable  distances  inland,  flooding  valuable  land  with  saltwater  and \ncausing loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and disruption of livelihoods.  \n \n6. \nThe  dominant  river  system  in  the  north  is  the  basin  of  the  1,149  kilometer  Red  River. \nRivers  in  the  central  region  are  relatively  short  with  sharp  transitions  from  steep  mountains  to \nflat  coastal  plains,  the  average  distance  from  the  mountains  to  the  coast  being  only  70 \nkilometers.  During  the  2005  series  of  typhoons  and  floods,4 these  rivers  experienced  serious \nfloods, which caused deaths and injuries (397 persons killed or missing). The typhoons, floods, \nand  related  phenomena  damaged  houses,  agricultural  land,  aquaculture  ponds,  and  key \ninfrastructure. The estimated damage for 2005 was D5,800 billion ($365 million).5 \n \n7. \nIn  general,  the  project  provinces  (except  Nam  Dinh  and  Phu  Yen)  have  high \npercentages  of  poor  residents.  High  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  central  region  and  northwest \nprovinces  are  associated  with  low  economic  development  and  insufficient  local  revenue  to \nfinance  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction  of  damaged  infrastructure.  The  diminishing  return  from \nsubsistence  agriculture,  given  high  birth  rates  and  limited  land  per  capita,  presents  these \ncommunities with bleak prospects for future generations.  \n \nThe  northwest  provinces,  where  subsistence  agriculture  provides  the  major  source  of \n8. \nemployment  and  income,  are  the  poorest  provinces  and  have  the  highest  proportion  of  ethnic \nminority  groups.  Typically  these  groups  have  extremely  limited  access  to  development  assets \nand farm marginal lands using inappropriate technologies. Progress is being made in reducing \npoverty  and  improving  social  development  for  ethnic  groups,  but  the  rate  of  success  remains \nconsistently  lower  than  the  national  average.  In  coastal  regions,  sources  of  income  are  more \nvaried  and  include  fisheries,  agriculture,  paid  employment,  salt  production,  processing  of  dry \nseafood, and a number of trades such as carpentry.  \n. \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n9. \nThe  main  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  ensure  rapid  resumption  of  livelihoods  in  the \naffected  areas  by  reinstating  essential  infrastructure  and  services.  The  Project  will have  many \npositive  social  and  environmental  impacts.  As  much  as  possible,  damaged  structure  will  be \nrehabilitated  or  reconstructed  at  the  original  site.  Hence,  little  land  acquisition  will  be  required \nand no involuntary resettlement.6 Only subprojects classified as environmental category B or C \nwill be accepted into the Project. \n \n                                                 \n4   The 2005 series was the most damaging since 1996 due to the cumulative effects of several high-intensity events \n\nhitting a broad area repeatedly over a short period. \n\n5   This excludes damage to sea dikes estimated at about $670 million and damage to flood protection embankments. \n6   Subprojects requiring significant land acquisition and/or relocation of people are not eligible for funding under the \n\nProject.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nNegative  environmental  impacts  relate  mainly  to  the  construction  phase  and  include \n10. \nincreased dust, noise, traffic, and soil erosion. Risks are also associated with accidental spillage \nof fuel, other potentially hazardous products, and untreated effluent onto land or into rivers and \nwetlands. Some small areas of land could be damaged by construction plant; and river bed and \nbank changes could result from nearby excavation for, or reconstruction of, hydraulic structures \nsuch  as  weirs,  bridges,  and  flood  protection  embankments.  All  such  impacts  or  risks  will  be \nshort-term  and  can  be  mitigated  by  adopting  suitable  construction  practices.  The  potential  for \nlonger term impacts due to the reinstatement  of embankments and dikes, such as changes in \nthe course of rivers or locally severe erosion along the seashore, is low but will nevertheless be \nexamined during the feasibility study and detailed design stages.  \n \n11. \nPotential subprojects will be excluded from project financing if they (i) are located within \nor adjacent to designated protected or conservation areas and their buffer zones, (ii) are likely to \nsignificantly change the course of a river or alter river characteristics, or (iii) have the potential to \nmake significant changes in the surrounding environment, including existing wetlands.  \n \nThe  Quynh  Di  dike  subproject  in  Quynh  Luu  district,  Nghe  An  province,  is  adjacent  to \n12. \nabout  45  hectares  of  secondary  mangrove  forest  planted  in  2000  under  a  Belgian-funded \nproject.7 Rehabilitation work will cause some damage to mangroves adjacent to the dike, but the \nexpected  impact  will  be  minimal.  Mitigation  measures  include  the  planting  of  an  area  of \nmangroves equal at least to the area lost due to rehabilitation work. \n \n13. \nRehabilitation  will  generally  be  done  within  the  existing  right-of-way  of  the  damaged \nstructures.  Some  small  areas  of  land  may  need  to  be  acquired  if  the  original  site  has  been \neroded  or  otherwise  rendered  unsuitable,  an  alternative  nearby  site  offers  greater  security  in \nterms of future flood events, or sound technical and financial reasons can be cited for selecting \nanother site. The main impacts will be temporary loss of access to or use of small areas of land \nadjacent  to  the  works,  minor  damage  to  agricultural  land  or  other  assets  during  construction, \nand  in  isolated  cases,  permanent  occupancy  of  some  areas  of  land.  The  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  deemed  not  significant  and  the  Project  is  classified  category  B  for \nresettlement.8 A resettlement framework was prepared to guide the preparation of resettlement \nplans in such cases.  \n \n14. \nEthnic minority groups account for 90% of the population in Ha Giang and 80% in Yen \nBai provinces. Any subprojects in these provinces involving land acquisition and/or resettlement \nare  highly  likely  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  However,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to \naffect  their  (i)  customary  rights  of  access  to  or  use  of  land  and  natural  resources;  (ii) \nsocioeconomic status; (iii) cultural and communal integrity; (iv) health, education, livelihood, and \nsocial  security  status;  or  (v)  recognition  of  indigenous  knowledge.  The  Project  is  classified \ncategory  B/C  in  relation  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples. 9 Specific  indicators  will  be \nincluded as part of the project performance monitoring system to ensure that indigenous people \nparticipate in all phases of subproject selection, preparation, and implementation, and that they \nwill share equitably in project benefits.  \n\n                                                 \n7   The Quynh Di estuary is not listed as a designated area in the list of protected/conservation areas maintained by \n\nthe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.  \n\n8   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. This policy paper defines resettlement as \u201csignificant\u201d when 200 or \nmore people experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as involving people being physically displaced \nfrom  housing  and/or  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive,  income-generating  assets.  ADB.  2003.

The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development \n(MARD)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  MARD,  through  the  Central  Project \nManagement  Unit  (CPMU)  of  its  Central  Project  Office,  will  assure  overall  planning, \ncoordination,  and  reporting  for  the  Project.  The  CPMU  director10 in  Hanoi  will  be  the  project \ndirector. In each of the 10 project provinces, the provincial department of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment  (DARD)  through  its  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  select, \nprepare,  and  implement  subprojects.  The  CPMU  will  liaise  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittee  and  DARD  in  each  province  to  coordinate  subproject  implementation.  International \nconsultants will assist the CPMU. Where MARD or the DARDs are not directly responsible for \nany particular type of infrastructure, the DARD will work closely with the relevant authority. \n \n16. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework. An environmental assessment \nand review framework was prepared to guide the screening of subprojects, set out institutional \narrangements \nto  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  define \nenvironmental assessment requirements complying with the applicable laws and regulations of \nthe  Government  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy. 11  The  framework  is  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  DARDs,  through  their  PPMUs,  are  responsible  for  (i)  screening  and  classifying \n17. \nsubprojects  (and  excluding  any  classified  category  A  in  relation  to  ADB's  policies  on \nenvironment, resettlement, or indigenous peoples);12 (ii) implementing public consultations and \ncarrying  out  social  analyses  and  environmental  assessments;  (iii)  preparing  subproject \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  design;  (iv)  supervising  construction  implementation  (including \nthe  incorporation  of  any  specified  environmental  mitigation  measures  and/or  specific  actions \naimed at mitigating adverse social impacts and compensating people affected for losses); and \n(v) ensuring adherence to the environmental management and monitoring plan (EMP).13  \n \n18. \nThe PPMUs will supervise national consulting firms to prepare necessary environmental \nassessment,  management,  and  performance  monitoring  reports,  including  IEEs,  EMPs,  and \nconstruction  specifications  with  clearly  defined  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  to  be  put  in  place  by  contractors.  During  construction,  the  PPMUs  will  report  on \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  mitigation  measures.  The  CPMU  will \nconsolidate  the  provincial  reports  for  submission  to  ADB  every  6  months  during  project \nimplementation. One international (3 person-months) and one national environment specialist (9 \nperson-months) will be recruited as part of the international review consultant team to help the \nPPMUs  classify  subprojects  and  prepare  IEEs  and  EMPs  for  representative  subprojects  in \ncompliance with Government and ADB requirements.  \n \nInformation  Disclosure.  The  Damage  and  Needs \n19. \nAssessment Mission did not provide for public consultation in relation to the Project. Extensive \nmeetings and discussions were held with national and local government officials in each of the \ntarget  provinces,  and  discussions  were  held  with  district  and  commune  people\u2019s  committees. \n\nPublic  Consultation  and \n\n                                                 \n10  The  CPMU  is  based  on  the  resources  and  staff  used  for  the  recently  completed  ADB.  1997.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project. Manila (Loan 1564-VIE[SF]). \n\n11  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n12  Screening of subprojects will be a continuous process and subproject classification will be adjusted if necessary on \ncompletion of detailed design. The PPMU will be responsible for preparing IEEs for any category B subprojects. \n\n13  A generic EMP for the Project is available in the IEE included as Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nInterviews  were  also  carried  out  with  selected  communities  on-site  during  the  field  visits.  The \n2005 series of typhoons and storms caused devastating effects on rural infrastructure and the \nlives  of  those  affected.  Across  the  spectrum  of  government  officials  and  local  communities, \nsupport  was  strong  for  rapid  rehabilitation  of  damaged  infrastructure  as  a  means  of  restoring \nlivelihoods and promoting general well-being in the communities. \n \n20. \nDuring  implementation,  the  PPMUs  will  initiate  and  lead  public  consultation  as  part  of \nenvironmental  screening  and  social  assessments  for  each  selected  subproject.  This  will  help \nidentify  any  subproject-specific  impacts  for  which  environmental  or  social  mitigation  measures \nwill be required. On the basis of the consultations, the PPMU  will ensure that the concerns of \nthose  affected  are  taken  into  account  in  the  subproject  design  arrangement,  implementation, \nmonitoring,  and  operation  to  the  extent  possible.  All  relevant  project  information  and  any \nresettlement plan, IEE, summary IEE, EMP, indigenous peoples development plan, or specific \nactions prepared under the Project will be made freely available to all individuals affected and \nother interested parties, in both English and Vietnamese, and will be posted on ADB\u2019s website \nfollowing ADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design.14 \n \nF. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  Project \n\n21. \ninvolves  rehabilitation  and  occasionally  complete  reconstruction  of \ninfrastructure  damaged  in  the  2005  series  of  typhoons  and  storms.  Significant  environmental \nand  social  benefits  are  associated  with  the  Project  such  as  reduced  riverbank  and  seashore \nerosion,  reduced  health  risks,  improved  evacuation  of  floods,  and  reduced  waterlogging  of \nagricultural land.  \n \n22. \nThe IEE did not identify any significant adverse environmental impacts associated with \nthe proposed works, and the Project will not finance any subprojects located in environmentally \nsensitive areas.15 Hence, the Project is classified overall as environmental category B. Individual \nsubprojects  will  be  assessed  at  feasibility  study/detailed  design  stage  to  determine  specific \nenvironmental  categories.  The  generic  mitigation  measures  described  in  the  IEE  will  be \nreinforced  by  detailed  mitigation  measures  formulated  during  implementation  to  minimize  site-\nspecific negative environmental impacts. The environmental assessment and review framework \nwill provide adequate guidance for the PPMUs to screen subprojects, determine the appropriate \nmitigation  measures  for  any  identified  negative  impacts,  and  implement  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring during project implementation and beyond. Therefore, conduct of \nan environmental impact assessment is not required. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  The  relevant  requirements  for  this  are  set  out  in  ADB.  2005.

Subprojects will be \nselected  from  among  those  inspected  during  the  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission \n(March\u2013April  2006),  at  which  time  105  subprojects  were  considered  suitable  on  the  basis  of \nrapid visual inspection. Based on information obtained by the Mission, these subprojects satisfy \ntwo critical selection criteria: (i) the proposed rehabilitation is directly related to typhoon damage \nin  2005;  and  (ii)  the  subprojects  do  not  require  significant  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.1 \nThirty-nine priority subprojects were identified for implementation as soon as the loan becomes \neffective. The scale of rehabilitation work in each subproject is mostly small (less than $1 million \nequivalent).2 \n \nThe  main  impacts  of  rehabilitation  will  be  temporary  loss  of  access  to  or  use  of  small \n2. \nareas of land adjacent to the works; minor damage to agricultural land or other assets caused \nby construction works, and the movement of construction plant and materials to and from work \nsites;  and  permanent  occupancy  of  some  areas  of  land  in  isolated  cases. 3 The  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  deemed  not  significant  and,  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) involuntary resettlement policy (footnote 1) and Operations Manual,4 \nthe  Project  is  classified as  category  B.  None  of  the  potential  subprojects  has  been  definitively \nscreened from the perspective of involuntary resettlement impacts. Hence, subprojects involving \npermanent or temporary loss of assets, changes in land use, or restrictions in relation to access \nhave not been identified. \n \n3. \nFull resettlement plans (as required for category A projects) will not be required because \nany  subproject  with  significant  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the \nProject.  Short  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  any  subprojects  found  to  have \nresettlement impacts up to the limits of category B.  \n \nThe  resettlement  framework,  endorsed  by  the  Government,  guides  the  preparation  of \n4. \nresettlement  plans  should  any  be  needed  during  project  implementation.  The  framework  sets \nout the policy, procedures, and institutional requirements for preparing the plans during project \nimplementation  to  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. It also describes the procedures to be adopted by the implementing agencies, the \nprovincial  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs),  in  the  screening  of \nsubprojects. The responsibility for preparing a social analysis (and resettlement plan if needed) \nfor each subproject, based on the principles outlined in this framework, rests with the respective \nDARD (paras. 10\u201311). \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. This policy paper defines resettlement as \u201csignificant\u201d where 200 or \nmore people experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as involving people being physically displaced \nfrom housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n\n2   Four sections of sea dike/flood protection are estimated to cost $3.4 million\u2013$8.5 million each. \n3   Significant resettlement impacts are not expected because subprojects requiring significant land acquisition and/or \nrelocation of people are not eligible for funding under the Project. Most of the rehabilitation work will be done within \nthe  existing  right-of-way  of  the  damaged  infrastructure.  Acquisition  of  some  small  areas  of  land  may  be  needed \nwhere  infrastructure  cannot  be  reinstated  within  the  original  site.  This  may  occur  if  the  site  has  been  eroded  or \notherwise rendered unsuitable, an alternative nearby site offers greater security in terms of future flood events, or \nsound technical and financial reasons are given for selecting another site. \n4   ADB. 2003.

The  policy \n\n5. \nframework  and  resettlement  entitlements  were \ndeveloped from Viet  Nam\u2019s laws (principally the 1993 Land Law amended in 1998, 2001, and \n2003);  Decree  197/CP  (2004)  on  Compensation,  Support,  and  Resettlement  when  land  is \nrecovered by the State, as amended by Decree 17/CP (2006); Circular 116 (2004) on guiding \nthe implementation of Decree 197; and ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement (footnote 1), \nindigenous  peoples, 5  gender  and  development  (2003),  accountability  (2003),  and  public \ncommunications (2005). With the promulgation of Decree 197/CP (2004) and Decree 17/2006, \nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  and  legal  framework  governing  resettlement  was  adjusted  to  come \nclose  to  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  However,  the  provisions  and \nprinciples adopted in this framework and subsequent plans will supersede the provisions of the \nrelevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists,  as  provided  for  under \nDecree  17/ND-CP  (May  2001),  which  regulates  the  management  and  use  of  official \ndevelopment assistance.  \n \n6. \n \n \n\nThe basic principles are the following: \n\n(i) \n\nAcquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative  project \ndesigns,  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and  engineering \nsolutions that have the least impact on populations in the project area. \nPeople  affected  by  the  Project6 are  defined  as  those  who  stand  to  lose,  as  a \nconsequence of the Project, all or part of their physical and nonphysical assets, \nincluding homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy, \nincome-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and \nother losses that may be identified during resettlement planning. \nAll people affected who are identified in the project-impacted areas on the date of \nthe  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  their  lost \nassets,  incomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost,  and  to  be  provided  with \nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  help  them  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain \ntheir preproject living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels. \nAll people affected will be eligible for compensation and rehabilitation assistance, \nirrespective of tenure status, social or economic standing, and any such factors \nthat  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the  objectives  of  items  (i)\u2013(iii).  Neither \nlack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected tenure status or social \nor  economic  status  will  bar  the  individual  affected  from  entitlements  to  such \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  measures  or  resettlement  objectives.  Nontitled \nindividuals  or  those  who  have  no  recognizable  rights  or  claims  to  the  land  that \nthey  are  occupying,  (e.g.,  squatters),  are  entitled  to  compensation  for  nonland \nassets  and  various  options  of \nthey \ncultivated/occupied  the  land  before  the  eligibility  cut-off  date.  Resettlement \nassistance  to  nontitled  individuals  will  include  compensation  for  lost  assets  and \n\nresettlement  assistance,  provided \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n6   The  term  affected  person  includes  any  people,  households,  firms,  or  private  institutions  who,  on  account  of \nchanges that result from the Project will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest \nin any house, land (including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and /or grazing land, water resources, or \nany  other  moveable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in \npart, permanently or temporarily, and/or (iii) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely \naffected, with or without displacement (OMF2/BP). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv) \n\n(xv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5        39      \n\nto \n\nreplacement  of  assets  prior \n\nrestoration  of  income  and  living  standards.  Assistance  may  also  include \nreplacement  land,  although  nontitled  individuals  are  not  entitled  to  this.  The \nresettlement package will include measures to ensure that they are able to find \nalternative sites or income sources, depending on their losses. \nPeople affected will be fully consulted and fully participate in the preparation and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans.  Their  comments  and  suggestions  as  well \nas  of  the  communities  will  be  taken  into  account  during  the  design  and \nimplementation phases of resettlement activities. \nIndividuals  who  lose  10%  or  more  of  productive  land,  assets,  or  income  are \nconsidered  to  be  severely  affected.  In  addition  to  compensation  for  lost  assets, \nthe  Project  will  provide  appropriate  rehabilitation  measures  to  assist  them  to \nrestore their preproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \nIndividuals  who  lose  only  part  of  their  physical  assets  will  not  be  left  with  a \nportion  that  will  be  inadequate  to  sustain  their  current  standard  of  living.  The \nminimum  size  of  remaining  land  and  structures  will  be  agreed  during  the \nresettlement planning process. \nThe compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures will be in place before the Government and ADB approve \naward  of  any  contract  for  civil  works  in  the  affected  area.  No  subproject  will \nproceed  without \nthe  dispossession  or \ndisplacement of affected people. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD),  the  Executing \nAgency, will verify that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective \nand  timely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and  implementation  of  the  land \nacquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \nExisting  cultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected,  and  to  the  maximum \nextent practical, preserved. \nAdequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover \nthe  costs  of  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  within  the  agreed \nimplementation period. \nSpecial measures will be incorporated in resettlement plans prepared under the \nProject  and  complementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  protect \nsocially  and  economically  vulnerable  groups  that  may  be  at  high  risk  of \nimpoverishment, such as those without legal title to land or other assets, ethnic \nminorities, households headed by women, children, the disabled or elderly, and \nthe poorest people.7 Appropriate assistance through asset-building strategies will \nbe  provided  to  help  them  improve  their  socioeconomic  status  such  as  land-for-\nland,  replacement  housing  of  minimum  standards,  and  increased  security  of \ntenure (footnote 4). \nResettlement  identification,  planning,  implementation,  and  management  will \nincluding  gender-specific \nensure \nconsultation  and  information  disclosure.  This  includes  special  attention  to \nguarantee  women\u2019s  assets,  property,  and  land-use  rights;  and  to  ensure  the \nrestoration of their income and living standards. \nEffective  mechanisms  will  be  established  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances \nduring the preparation and implementation of resettlement plans. \nDetails  of  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  to  those  affected  and  any \ninterested  groups  through  public  meetings  and  in  the  form  of  summary \n\nthat  gender  concerns  are \n\nincorporated, \n\n                                                 \n7   Very  poor  households  are  those  whose  incomes  are  below  the  national  poverty  line  (i.e.,  those  with  monthly \n\nhousehold income of less than D200,000 per capita in rural areas and D260,000 per capita in urban areas). \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nresettlement plans or information booklets and leaflets in a language that can be \nunderstood  by  those  affected,  and  in  an  accessible  place  (such  as  project  and \ncommune offices). The detailed resettlement information including measurement \nof  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and  special  provisions, \ngrievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments,  and  displacement  schedule  must  be \ndisclosed to the affected people in a form and language they can understand. \nTemporarily  affected  land  and  communal  infrastructure  will  be  restored  to \npreproject conditions. \nAppropriate  reporting  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be \nidentified and set in place as part of the resettlement management system. \n\n \n\n \n\n(xvi) \n\n(xvii) \n\n \n7. \nEntitlement  Matrix.  The  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A5)  summarizes  the  main  types  of \nlosses and the corresponding nature and scope of entitlement. The provisions in the matrix will \nbe  reviewed  and  revised  during  loan  implementation,  if  necessary,  to  ensure  relevance  and \nsuitability to meet resettlement principles. During preparation of resettlement plans, replacement \ncost surveys will be carried out to determine actual replacement costs and rates. \n \n8. \nEthnic  Minorities,  Vulnerable  Groups,  and  Gender  Aspects.  Within  the  project \nprovinces,  ethnic  minority  groups  account  for  90%  of  the  population  in  Ha  Giang  and  80%  in \nYen  Bai  provinces.  Any  subprojects  in  these  provinces  that  involve  land  acquisition  and/or \nresettlement are likely to have impacts on indigenous people. However, the Project is unlikely to \naffect  their  (i)  customary  rights  of  access  to  or  use  of  land  and  natural  resources;  (ii) \nsocioeconomic status; (iii) cultural and communal integrity; (iv) health, education, livelihood, and \nsocial  security  status;  or  (v)  recognition  of  indigenous  knowledge.  The  types  of  temporary \ndisturbance that may be caused by rehabilitation activities will affect both indigenous people and \nthe Kinh people in the same ways.  \n \n9. \nA  social  analysis  will  be  carried  out  during  the  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design \nstages to identify any special attention or needs for indigenous people and other disadvantaged \ngroups such as landless, poor, households headed by women, elderly, and disabled that should \nbe  included  during  implementation  (paras.  12\u201314).  A  gender  strategy  will  be  included  in  any \nresettlement  plans  that  may  be  required. 8  To  ensure  income  and  assets  are  replaced  at \nreplacement  cost  and  that  equal  opportunities  are  provided  for  employment,  the  DARDs  will \nengage them in the process of planning, design, and implementation. Specific indicators9 will be \nincluded in the project performance monitoring system to monitor achievement of resettlement \nimplementation targets.  \n \nC. \n\nProcedure for Formulating and Implementing a Resettlement Plan \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n10.  MARD,  through  the  Central  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU)  of  its  Central  Project \nOffice,  will  assure  overall  planning,  coordination,  and  reporting  for  the  Project.  The  CPMU \n\n                                                 \n8   The  social  dimensions  specialist  and  the  organization  that  will  plan  and  implement  income-restoration  programs \nwill  ensure  that  they  or  members  of  their  teams  have  (i)  experience  in  preparing  and  implementing  gender  and \ndevelopment programs in Viet Nam, (ii) the necessary gender perspective and experience to deal with vulnerable \ngroups, and (iii) female staff. \n\n9   These may include (i) resettlement implemented in compliance with plans; (ii) legal wages paid to all workers; (iii) \nlivelihoods  and  living  standards  restored,  if  not  improved,  for  all  people  affected;  and  (iv)  equal  employment \nopportunities as reflected in the proportionate representation in work forces of women and indigenous people. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5        41      \n\ndirector10 in  Hanoi  will  be  the  project  director.  In  each  of  the  10  project  provinces,  the  DARD \nthrough  its  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  select,  prepare,  and  implement \nsubprojects.  The  CPMU  will  liaise  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  and  DARD  in \neach  province  to  coordinate  subproject  implementation.  A  resettlement  committee,  headed  by \nthe  vice  chairperson  of  the  province  or  district,  will  lead  the  resettlement  process  in  each \naffected subproject.11 A social dimensions specialist (6 person-months), engaged as part of the \nteam  of  review  consultants,  will  provide  guidance  to  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs  in  relation  to \nresettlement, indigenous people, and gender issues.12 \n \n\n2. \n\nProcedure for Formulation of Short Resettlement Plans \n\n11. \nThe  DARDs  will  select  subprojects  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  work  closely  with  the  resettlement  committees  to  complete  the \nresettlement  process. 13 If  resettlement  impacts  are  unavoidable,  the  DARD  will  formulate  a \nresettlement plan for the subproject using the following procedure: \n \n \n\n(i) \n\nScreen  all  subprojects  for  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  categorize  the \nimpacts based on the feasibility study or detailed design, and obtain the approval \nof  ADB's  resettlement  specialist  in  the  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Department  of \nthe  proposed  resettlement  categorization.  Any  subproject  classified  as  category \nA (i.e., requiring preparation of a full resettlement plan) because of resettlement \nimpacts  is  to  be  eliminated  from  further  consideration  (footnote  3).  A  short \nresettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  if  fewer  than  200  people  will  be  physically \ndisplaced  from  housing  or  lose  less  than  10%  of  their  productive  (income-\ngenerating)  assets,  the  impacts  are  not  significant,  and  the  subproject  is \nclassified category B.14  \nConduct  stakeholder  consultations  to  determine  ways  of  avoiding  or  minimizing \nadverse impacts and to identify the needs and preferences of those affected. \nFor  any  category  B  subproject,  undertake  a  census  or  population  record  of \npeople affected, an inventory, and detailed measurement survey  (DMS) of their \naffected  assets  (para.  12). 15  Identify  and  record  people  requiring  particular \nassistance  (such  as  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable)  to  plan  specific  actions  to \nmitigate hardships and assist in improving their livelihoods. \nUndertake  a  socioeconomic  survey  to  obtain  data  on  the  economic  and  social \ncondition of those affected (para. 14).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n10  The  CPMU  is  based  on  the  resources  and  staff  used  for  the  recently  completed  ADB.  1997.

Manila (Loan 1564-VIE[SF]). \n\n11  Representatives of the Women\u2019s Union and Farmers\u2019 Association will be included in the resettlement committees. \n12  The social dimensions specialist will be required to have appropriate language skills. \n13  Where MARD and/or the DARD are not directly responsible for any particular type of infrastructure, the DARD will \n\nwork closely with the relevant authority. \n\n14  During detailed design, every effort will be made to avoid relocating households or interfering in the income-earning \nactivities of those at or near the site. If any land is to be acquired for implementation of the subproject or if people \noccupying  or  using  land  at  the  subproject  site  are  impacted  in  any  way  that  would  necessitate  compensation,  a \nresettlement plan will be prepared and disclosed to those affected. Approval of the resettlement plan by ADB will \nbe a precondition to award of contracts for civil works in such cases.  \n\n15  The DARD  will maintain a computerized database of people affected and their assets. The databases for project \n\nprovinces will be consolidated project-wide by the CPMU. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nthe  draft \n\nresettlement  plans  and \n\nUndertake  a  replacement  cost  survey  for  various  types  of  affected  assets  as  a \nbasis  for  determining  compensation  rates  at  replacement  cost  (para.  15). \nDetermine the losses in accordance with the entitlement matrix.16 \nProvide project and resettlement information to all people affected in a form and \nlanguage  that  are  understandable  to  them,  and  closely  consult  them  on \ncompensation and resettlement options, including relocation sites and economic \nrehabilitation. \nPrepare \ntime-bound  action  plan  or \nimplementation schedule, including procedures for grievance redress, monitoring \nand evaluation, and budgeting.  \nTranslate  the  draft  resettlement  plan  into  local  languages  as  appropriate  and \nmake it fully available during consultation and public meetings.17  \nFinalize the resettlement plan in both Vietnamese and English versions, submit it \nto ADB for approval, and disclose the final resettlement plan in accordance with \nADB's  policy  on  public  communications18 to  the  affected  communities  and  on \nADB's website (para. 19).  \nImplement the resettlement plan and submit progress reports to ADB as part of \nproject performance monitoring. \nSubmit a subproject resettlement completion report to ADB and request approval \nto award related civil works contracts. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n \n12. \nSurveys  for  Resettlement  Plan  Preparation. The DMS of lost assets will collect data \non the affected assets from all of the people affected following detailed design of the subproject. \nFor each individual affected, the scope of the data will include \n \n \n \n \n\ntotal affected area of land by type of land asset; \ntotal affected structures by type of structure (main or secondary); \nlegal  status  of  affected  land  and  structure  assets,  duration  of  tenure,  and \nownership; \nquantity and type of affected crops and trees; \nquantity of other losses (e.g., business, job, or other productive asset); \nquantity/area  of  affected  common  property  and  community  or  public  assets  by \ntype; \nsummary data on affected households by ethnicity, gender of head of household, \nhousehold  size,  primary  and  secondary  sources  of  household  income  vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe  poverty  line,  whether  the  affected  land  is  the  primary  source  of  income, \namount of income, and whether the household is headed by elderly or disabled \npeople; and \nknowledge of those affected of the subproject and preferences for compensation, \nincluding relocation sites and rehabilitation measures as applicable. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(viii) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  data  collected  during  the  DMS  will  constitute  the  formal  basis  for  determining \n\n \n13. \nentitlements and level of compensation for people affected.  \n \n14. \nThe socioeconomic survey will include a poverty assessment and survey of at least 10% \nof those affected and 20% of those severely affected, together with local subproject impact data, \n\n                                                 \n16  If  new  categories  of  people  affected  and  losses  are  developed,  other  than  those  described  in  the  entitlement \n\nmatrix, the entitlements will be derived in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy and Operations Manual (footnote 4).  \n\n17 The final resettlement plan will incorporate the comments and suggestions of the people affected \n18 ADB. 2005. Public Communications Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5        43      \n\ndisaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity.  Its  purpose  is  to  provide  baseline  data  from  which  to \nassess resettlement impacts and design rehabilitation measures. These data will also be used \nfor resettlement monitoring. The required data (additional to that collected in the DMS) include \n \n \n\n(i) \n\nhousehold  head  (name,  sex,  age,  livelihood  or  occupation,  income,  education, \nand ethnicity), \nhousehold  members  (number,  employment  status,  school-age  children  and \nschool attendance, and literacy; all disaggregated by gender), and \nliving conditions (access to water, sanitation, and energy for cooking and lighting; \nownership of durable goods).  \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n15. \nIn  accordance  with  decrees  188/2004  and  197/2004,  the  PPCs  annually  update  the \nprices and rates used for compensation for land and property. The PPC rates will be adjusted, \nas  necessary,  based  on  the  findings  of  a  replacement  cost  survey  to  be  conducted  in  parallel \nwith the DMS and socioeconomic survey. Information will be collected from both secondary and \nprimary  sources,  i.e.,  interviews  with  people  in  the  affected  area,  including  both  affected  and \nunaffected.  Compensation  rates  will  be  continuously  updated  to  ensure  that  those  affected \nreceive compensation at replacement cost at the time of compensation payment.  \n \n16. \nResettlement  and  Income-Restoration  Strategies.  Households  that  have  to  relocate \nwill participate in identifying and selecting relocation options, either on their existing land, within \na  relocation  site,  or  cash  compensation  to  make  their  own  relocation  arrangements.  For  any \nbusiness  that  has  to  be  relocated,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  find  a  viable  new  site. \nHouseholds  that  lose  10%  or  more  of  productive  assets  will  be  provided  replacement  land  if \navailable,  or  assisted  to  purchase  replacement  land,  increase  productivity  on  their  remaining \nland, or learn new income-generating skills. Appropriate livelihood restoration programs will be \ndesigned and implemented during project implementation in consultation with those affected.19  \n \nConsultation,  Grievances,  and  Disclosure. Consultation with the affected people will \n17. \ntake  place  during  the  feasibility  study  phase  if  possible,  and  will  be  completed  prior  to \nfinalization of detailed designs so that their needs and preferences can be incorporated into the \ndesign arrangements where practicable. The affected people will be invited to participate in field \nwalks  to  select  the  alignment  of  any  structures  (e.g.,  flood  embankments,  canals,  drains,  sea \ndikes, roads, bridges) whose reinstatement would take place at a location not exactly coincident \nwith  the  structure\u2019s  original  location.  They  will  also  participate  in  the  various  resettlement  plan \nprocesses,  including  preparation  of  the  inventory  of  losses,  validation  of  compensation  rates \nand entitlements, hand over of entitlements, monitoring of impacts and benefits, and discussion \nand settlement of grievances.  \n \n18. \nTo  ensure  that  all  grievances  of  those  affected  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation,  relocation,  and  determination  and  payment  of  entitlements  are  resolved  in  a \ntimely  and  satisfactory  manner,  and  that  all  avenues  for  airing  grievances  are  available,  the \nProject will set up a mechanism to deal with any such grievances during project implementation. \nThe  affected  individuals  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  (both  verbally  and  in  writing) \nduring  consultations  and  at  each  phase  of  the  resettlement  process.  Detailed  procedures  for \nhearing and redressing grievances, including appeal processes, will be made public through an \neffective  public  information  campaign.  Resettlement  committees  will  record  and  report  on  all \ncomplaints and their resolution. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  The cost of any such program will be integrated into the cost of the subproject. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nto \n\nThe PPMUs, assisted by the resettlement committees, will disclose (i) draft resettlement \n19. \nplans  prepared  on  the  basis  of  design  layouts  for  the  subprojects,  (ii)  final  resettlement  plans \napproved  by  MARD  (CPMU)  and  ADB,  and  (iii)  any  revisions  to  the  resettlement  plans  as  a \nresult of changes in scope or design layout. Key information in the resettlement plans, including \nthose  affected  before \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  options,  will  be  disclosed \ncommencement  of  civil  works.  The  information  will  be  made  publicly  available  in  a  readily \naccessible  location  and  be  in  the  form  of  an  information  leaflet  or  brochure,  summary \nresettlement plan, or complete resettlement plan\u2014all in a form and language that can be readily \nunderstood by those affected. All relevant project information, including final resettlement plans \nor specific actions prepared under the Project will be made freely available to all those affected \nand  other  interested  parties,  in  both  English  and  Vietnamese,  and  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite following ADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design.20  \n \n20.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  PPMUs  will  supervise \nthe  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans,  and  monitor  and  report  on  all  resettlement \nactivities.  Semiannual  resettlement  monitoring  progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB.  The \nCPMU  will  consolidate  all  provincial  reports  into  the  project  performance  monitoring  system, \nwhich will be used to prepare regular progress reports for submission to ADB. Monitoring and \nevaluation will focus on social impacts and whether the people affected are able to restore, and \npreferably improve upon, their preproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity.  \n \n21. \nBudget.  Using  the  PPCs\u2019  annually  updated  land  prices  and  compensation  rates, \nadjusted as necessary on the basis of the replacement cost survey, the full cost of resettlement \nand land acquisition will be determined. This cost will be added to the cost of all other aspects of \nthe subproject for budgeting loan and counterpart funds. The purchase of land will be financed \nby  the  Government  from  its  counterpart  funds.  Compensation,  allowances,  operation  and \nadministration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and  reporting  (including  independent  audits  of \nresettlement)  will  be  financed  from  loan  funds. The  commune  resettlement  committees  will  be \nresponsible  for  payment  of  compensation  directly  to  those  affected.  If  ADB  loan  funds  are \nutilized,  the  resettlement  plans  will  identify  key  activities  for  which  funds  will  be  used,  any \ndisbursal  milestones,  and  auditing  requirements  that  will  facilitate  appropriate  and  timely \ndelivery. \n \n\n                                                 \n20  The  relevant  requirements  for  this  are  set  out  in  ADB.  2005.

Flooding triggered by typhoons and storms is the most prevalent natural \ndisaster.  Disaster  management  is  a  priority  within  the  Government's  development  plans,  as  the  Government \nrecognizes  the  link  between  vulnerability  to  natural  disasters  and  persistent  poverty.  The  5-year  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plana  for  2006\u20132010  and  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (2002)  both \nemphasize  the  prevention  and  mitigation  of  natural  disasters  as  critically  important  means  of  helping  the  poor  in \ndisaster-prone areas. The Socioeconomic Development Plan aims to halve by 2010 the number of people who could \nbe re-impoverished by natural disasters or other risks.  \n \nEmbedded in the Government's disaster risk management strategiesb is the concept of including measures to prevent \nand  minimize  the  effects  of  natural  calamities  as  a  regular  part  of  development  programs  and  projects.  The \nGovernment is strengthening its disaster risk management strategy and programs to improve (i) disaster forecasting, \nwarning,  and  information  sharing;  (ii)  disaster  preparedness  and  emergency  relief;  (iii)  incorporation  of  disaster \nmitigation  into  development  programs;  and  (iv)  rehabilitation  and  long-term  recovery  after  disasters.  The  major \nobjective is to reduce the vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters and consolidate poverty reduction achievements. \n \nThe 2005 series of typhoons and tropical storms brought intense rainfall to a broad area of Viet Nam. The attendant \nwinds, floods, storm surges, and landslides destroyed many types of infrastructure that are critical to the livelihoods of \npoor  rural  households.  The  Government's  early  warnings  and  emergency  measures  prevented  large  loss  of  life.  In \naddition,  the  Government  responded  in  a  timely  manner  to  provide  food  and  other  essentials  to  families  evacuated \nfrom their homes or otherwise deprived of their normal means of livelihood in the aftermath of each event. The flood-\ndamaged  infrastructure  is  mostly  small-scale  and  its  construction  and  operation  comes  within  the  authority  of \nprovincial  agencies.  Its  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction  would,  under  normal  budgetary  provisions,  take  many  years, \nwhich would cause continued hardship and impoverishment to poor rural families. The loss of economic opportunities \nas a result of destroyed irrigation systems, aquaculture, and crops is a significant burden to the poor\u2014they now also \nsuffer  in  terms  of  access  to  roads,  markets,  schools,  and  particularly  clean  water.  Poor  and  disadvantaged \nhouseholds, especially households headed by women and ethnic minority groups are more vulnerable to such shocks \nand face a greater risk of becoming further marginalized. The typhoons and storms also had a deleterious impact on \nnatural resources, which are the main sources of income for the poor \n \nThe  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project  will  help  sustain  economic  growth  in  the  10  provinces \nseverely  affected  by  typhoons  in  2005  (Ha  Giang,  Ha  Tinh,  Nam  Dinh,  Nghe  An,  Phu  Tho,  Phu  Yen,  Quang  Binh, \nQuang  Tri, Thanh  Hoa,  and  Yen  Bai).  Its  outcome  will  be  rapid  resumption  of  livelihoods  in  the  affected  areas.  The \nProject  will  (i)  reinstate  essential  infrastructure,  including  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure;  and  (ii)  concurrently  provide  equivalent  or  enhanced  storm  and  flood  protection  to  vulnerable  areas \nwhere  feasible.  The  Project  will  make  a  significant  contribution  to  sustaining  and  enhancing  the  poverty  reduction \nbenefits achieved through provision of rural infrastructure in the affected areas. \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  damage  for  the  2005  storm  season  was  $327  million.  Loss  of  life,  livelihoods,  incomes,  and \nproperty  resulted  in  significant  socioeconomic  and  psychological  stress  including  the  evacuation  of  approximately \n600,000  inhabitants.  Many  of  those  directly  affected  (estimated  to  be  65%  of  the  total  population  in  three  coastal \nprovinces  by  the  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies)  require  significant  time  to \nreestablish their means of livelihood generation. During this period, many, including women, have migrated to Hanoi \nand other urban centers for temporary employment and leaving families. Also during this period many children  were \nunable  to  maintain  school  attendance  as  they  were  required  to  assist  family  members  in  the  reestablishment  of \nincome-generating activities. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFlood  disasters  affect  the  poor  disproportionately  in  terms  of  health,  housing,  employment,  livelihoods,  and  food \nsecurity. The main sources of income of the people living in the project areas are agriculture and aquaculture. In the \nproject  provinces,  poverty  incidence  ranges  from  35%  (Nam  Dinh)  to  as  high  as  75%  (Ha  Giang)  according  to  the \nGovernment Statistics Office data for 1999. A higher poverty incidence generally corresponds to a higher percentage \nof ethnic minority groups in the total population of the project areas. In particular, the northwest provinces\u2014Ha Giang \nand Yen Bai\u2014have a higher presence of ethnic minorities (90% and 80%). Ethnic minority are particularly vulnerable \nbecause they have limited access to agricultural land, market, and other economic activities.  \n \nDuring  each  typhoon  event,  many  affected  people  were  given  food,  shelter,  financial  support,  and  medicine,  by  the \nlocal  government  as  well  as  other  community  groups,  international  nongovernment  organizations,  and  development \nagencies. But in the recovery phase, the people have identified poor infrastructure facilities as the most important area \nfor rehabilitation for restoring livelihood and access to other services.  \n \nThe proposed Project does not target poverty directly and the small-scale localized nature of proposed restoration \nworks does not warrant a poverty impact assessment. During the social assessment of subprojects, specific issues \nrelating to providing employment benefits to the poor and disadvantaged should be incorporated into contracting \nprocedures. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n No \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n Yes  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment  Mission  adopted  a  participatory  process  to  identify  the  individual  subprojects, \nand  worked  closely  with  all  major  stakeholders  to  prioritize  the  subprojects.  The  Project\u2019s  intended  support  for \nrehabilitation  of  infrastructure  in  four  subsectors  (i)  roads,  (ii)  flood  protection,  (iii)  irrigation  systems,  and  (iv)  social \ninfrastructure was given high priority by all stakeholders. The outputs of the Mission were (i) formulation of a project \ndesign,  (ii)  development  of  criteria  for  screening  and  selecting  damaged  infrastructure  for  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement, and (iii) estimation of a rehabilitation budget. In addition, means to ensure the participation of the poor \nand other disadvantaged, including women, children, and households headed by women, were prepared. The Mission \ndiscussed and agreed  with the Government on technical assistance for institutional strengthening of the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD),  the  Executing  Agency,  and  implementing  agencies\u2014the \ndepartments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs)\u2014in  each  province.  To  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s \ncapacity to implement the Project and to increase sustainability of the infrastructure, a participatory approach will be \nfollowed  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  prepare  and  implement,  as  a  first  priority,  subprojects \nscreened  and  approved  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees.  Additional  subprojects  will  be  selected  during \nimplementation from an agreed list using a sector approach. Stakeholder participation in preparation, implementation, \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  monitoring  of  improved  infrastructure  will  be  encouraged  by  the  MARD  and  the \nDARDs  as  an  essential  way  of  lowering  costs  and  ensuring  sustainability.  Local  government  institutions  and \nnongovernment  organizations  will  be  involved  during  all  phases  of  project  implementation  and  performance \nmonitoring.  Preference  will  be  given  to  local  laborers,  especially  the  landless  and  poor,  in  construction  contracts. \nRehabilitation of infrastructure will help the beneficiaries participate in various social and economic activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen make up about 50%\u201351% of the total population of the project provinces. They are engaged in agriculture and \naquaculture activities, which will be supported through the subprojects by reducing (i) household vulnerability, (ii) crop \nlosses  from  the  coming  storm  season,  and  (iii)  time  for  marketing  and  accessing  services.  The  rehabilitation  of \ndamaged infrastructure will help women restore their income, and access markets and various services. Limited short-\nterm and seasonal employment will be created for women linked to the construction of infrastructure. The Project will \nfacilitate  women\u2019s  mobility  for  employment,  access  to  income-earning  activities,  and  access  to  services  for  their \nfamilies. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6       55  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

However,  in  some \ncases, temporary structures, shops, or microlevel service \nunits may trigger compensation requirements. Should any \nsubproject \nresettlement  or  affect  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods,  resettlement  including  compensation  will  be \nguided  by  the  resettlement  framework  presented  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \nThe affected population, including the poor, generally lack \nor  have  inadequate  access  to  infrastructure  and  related \nservices. The Project will help to improve connectivity and \nprovide  better  access  to  basic  infrastructure.  All  labor \nprovided  by  beneficiaries  will  be  compensated  at  normal \nwage rates. There is no cost implication for communities. \n \nNo  adverse  impact  is  anticipated.  The  Project  will  have \nsome  impact  by  creating  employment  opportunities  in \ninfrastructure  construction  and  maintenance,  mainly  for \npoor  unskilled  laborers,  both  female  and  male.  With  the \nimprovement  of  infrastructure  and  related  facilities,  off-\nfarm  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  will  be \nrestored,  expanded,  and  sustained.  The  Project  will  help \nreduce  unemployment  caused  by  the  typhoons  and \ntropical storms in 2005. \n \nPositive  impacts  will  be  significant  in  two  provinces\u2014Ha \nGiang  and  Yen  Bai\u2014which  have  a  high  proportion  of \nindigenous peoples in their population. Indigenous people \nliving  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from  the  improved \ninfrastructure. An ethnic minority development plan will be \nprepared  for  any  subprojects  likely  to  have  negative \nimpacts  on  indigenous  communities.  The  plans  will  be \nbased  on \nthe  agreed  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  prepared  during  the  Mission.  The  Project  will \nensure  the  participation  of  indigenous  people  in  planning \nand  implementation  so  that  they  derive  maximum  benefit \nfrom the infrastructure. \n \nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS in the project provinces is not \nsignificant, and the increased risk to HIV/AIDS due to the \nProject is minimal.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAffordability \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\na  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2005.
