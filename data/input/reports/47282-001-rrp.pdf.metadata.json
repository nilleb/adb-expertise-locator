In \npower  subsector,  generation  (renewable  energy),  transmission  (regional  and  domestic  lines), \nand  distribution  (on-  and  off-grid  networks)  projects  are  proposed,  while  wells  rehabilitation  is \nplanned in gas subsector. An MFF is proposed as (i) tranches will be programmatically aligned \nwith priorities of the government\u2019s $10.1 billion National Energy Supply Program 2013 (NESP), \n(ii)  the  program  will  be  a  showcase  to  explore  and  confirm  cofinancing  options  and  private \nsector participation, (iii) continuity in combining sector investments and nonphysical components \nfor  integrated  energy  sector  development  will  be  ensured,  and  (iv)  the  program  allows \nneighboring countries to develop regional projects for transit and trade.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nEnergy deficit. After security, access to energy is the highest priority of households and \nbusinesses  in  Afghanistan.3 Energy  demand  has  grown  by  almost  twice  the  economic  growth \nrate during 2005\u20132012. However, Afghanistan ranks among the lowest 5% in per capita energy \nconsumption globally and is a net energy importer. In 2014, more than 80% (1,000 megawatts \n[MW])  of  its  total  power  supply  (1,247  MW)  came  from  Iran  (16%),  Tajikistan  (25%), \nTurkmenistan  (12%),  and  Uzbekistan  (27%),  with  the  rest  generated  through  indigenous \nhydropower  and  thermal  sources.  Lack  of  domestic  generation  remains  the  key  challenge  for \nenergy security in Afghanistan.4 Insufficient energy supplies and the demand\u2013supply imbalance \nconstrain  growth  and  income  opportunities;  create  disparities  in  economic  development;  and \nfuel  ethnic  and  regional  tensions,  insecurity,  and  discontent.  Despite  significant  potential  for \nrenewable energy and fossil fuel reserves, these have not been developed because of financing \nconstraints. In 2014, nearly 97% of domestic oil needs were imported despite proven reserves \nof 80 million barrels in the Amu Darya basin\u2014one of four major gas basins. The lack of a gas \npricing  framework  and  insecurity  inhibit  private  sector  participation  to  develop  identified  gas \nreserves of 75 billion cubic meters\u2014enough to generate 400 MW of power annually for 75 years.  \n \n4. \nGrid power remains a growing portion of total energy consumption, and connection rates \nincreased  from  5%  in  2002  to  30%  in  2015,  at  the  current  supply  of  750  MW  and  power \nconsumption of 3,700 gigawatt-hours. Demand for power in four of Afghanistan\u2019s largest cities is \ngrowing  by  19%  annually,  and  by  2032  demand  is  forecast  to  reach  3,500  MW  and  power \nconsumption to 18,400 gigawatt-hours.5 Meeting this demand requires boosting all viable import \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  MFF  II:  Energy \n\nDevelopment 2014\u20132023 (TA 8509-AFG for $1.5 million approved on 20 November 2013). \n\n3   Surveys  conducted  by  The  Asia  Foundation  and  International  Finance  Corporation  in  2011  in  Afghanistan. \n\nHouseholds consume 85% of power, followed by commercial users (7%), government (5%), and others (3%). \n\n4   The  absence  of  a  water  treaty  with  neighboring  countries  impedes  the  development  of  indigenous  hydropower, \nwhile the refusal by mining investors to meet their contractual obligations is stalling coal or gas-to-power projects. \n5   ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Power Sector Master Plan.  Manila \n\n(TA 7637-AFG, for $1.5 million approved on 6 November 2010). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\noptions  in  parallel  to  harnessing  domestic  resources.  The  key  challenges  are  (i)  a  lack  of \ngeneration capacity, (ii) constraints in transmission and distribution systems, (iii) weak financial \nmanagement  and  operational  sustainability  of  sector  entities  due  to  an  inadequate  tariff \nframework,  and  (iv)  poor  sector  regulation.  The  MFF  will  address  these  points  directly.  Since \ngovernment  resources  are  limited,  financing  from  development  partners  and  private  sector \nparticipation are needed to bridge the infrastructure deficit. The NESP envisages investment of \n$10.1  billion  by  2030  to  (i)  increase  the  electrification  rate  from  30%  to  83%,  (ii)  increase \ndomestic generation from 20% to 67%, and (iii) strengthen power exchange and trade options. \nHowever, because of the limited fiscal space in government finances, dismal private investment \noutlook,  and  directives  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  the  government  against \nborrowing, grant funding from development partners will be the major source of NESP financing. \n \nEnergy infrastructure constraints. Of the 519 MW available installed capacity, 51% is \n5. \nthermal (diesel and furnace oil) with a generation cost of $0.25\u2013$0.35 per kilowatt-hour, nearly \nfour  to  five  times  cost  of  imported  power.  The  remaining  49%  (254  MW)  is  from  hydropower, \nwhich is seasonal and has a capacity factor of less than 40%. No new hydropower, gas, or coal \ngeneration has been added since the 1980s.6 Afghanistan\u2019s power system is not synchronized \nwith any of the four countries that it imports from, and is split into 10 power islands\u2014increasing \ncosts  and  reducing  reliability  of  supply.  The  individual  networks  operate  asynchronously  and \ncannot  be  interconnected  because  of  differences  in  operational  phase  angles  and  frequency \nvariations.  The  lack  of  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  suppresses  available  latent \ndemand  of  nearly  2,500  MW.  A  unified  grid  will  secure  power  supply  from  a  balanced  energy \nmix,  achieve  diversification,  and  share  reserve  capacity,  as  well  as  strengthen  Afghanistan\u2019s \nrole  as  an  electricity  transit  corridor  between  energy-rich  Central  Asia  and  energy-poor  South \nregional  Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013Tajikistan\u2013\nAsia.  Afghanistan \nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan (TUTAP) interconnection and Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India \n(TAPI)  natural  gas  pipeline  project.7 On  6  November  2015,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan \nsigned a 2015\u20132028 power purchase and sales agreement (PPSA) with Turkmenistan for year-\nround power supply (300 MW initially, with an increase of up to 500 MW) at a very competitive \ntariff  compared  with  existing  imports.  The  PPSA  will  be  renewed  thereafter.  The  PPSAs  with \nUzbekistan  (300  MW),  Tajikistan  (300 MW),  and  Iran  (150  MW)  are  effective  and  renewed \nannually. Despite barriers, the sector has curtailed technical, fiscal, and governance deficits.8  \n \n6. \nPolicy framework. The government is implementing the energy sector road map, policy \nframework,  and  the  envisaged  investment  plan  as  confirmed  in  its  power  sector  master  plan, \n2012\u20132032 and gas development master plan, 2015\u20132035, which both build on the Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy, 2008\u20132013, and are integrated into the NESP.9 The approved \nElectricity  Services  Law,  2015,  provides  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  and  a  transparent \nstructure for private sector participation.10 The power subsector in Afghanistan made substantial \n\nis  an  anchor \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n                                                \n6  The World Bank and the Government of the United States are assisting rehabilitation of three hydropower plants. \n7   TUTAP  is  a  regional  power  project  under  the  Central  Asia  South  Asia  Regional  Electricity  Markets  framework. \nPhase  1  of  TUTAP  (Afghanistan\u2013Uzbekistan  220-kilovolt  [kV]  line)  was  commissioned  in  2009.  Phase  2 \n(Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan 220 kV line) was commissioned in 2011. Phase 3 will be completed under tranches 1 and \n2 of the MFF. TUTAP meets Afghan power needs and all TUTAP imports until 2030 will be consumed in country. \nConstruction work on TAPI is expected to begin in 2016 and requisite tariff and transit agreements are signed. \n8  System losses dropped from 70% in 2002 to 25% in 2014; collection rates increased from 50% in 2002 to 90% in \n2014; revenues increased by 15% per quarter since 2009; and sector corporatization is enhanced by formation of \nDa  Afghanistan  Breshna  Sherkat  (DABS)  in  2009  and  the  Afghan  Gas  Enterprise  (AGE)  in  2011.  AGE \ncorporatization is supported by the World Bank to negotiate imported gas purchase and transit agreements. \n9   Because of fiscal challenges, the government is expected to finance less than 5% ($500 million) of the NESP. \n10  Under the law, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) will initially act as regulator. ADB will provide support to \n\nstrengthen the tariff determination framework and possible regulatory support under the MFF. \n\n\fprogress in meeting the strategic objectives and milestones set out in 2012, including (i) greater \nefficiency from existing operations (rehabilitation of hydropower plants and power networks); (ii) \nimprovement  in  sector  governance  (formulation  of  electricity  services  law,  renewable  energy \npolicy  and  autonomous  power  utility,  and  institutionalization  of  operations  and  management \nsystem); (iii) promotion of rural energy (development of off-grid networks); and (iv) investments \nin new capacity (development of additional generation, transmission, and distribution systems). \n \n7. \nRoad map and strategic context. The NESP road map, 2013\u20132030 focuses on energy \nsupply,  transmission  and  distribution,  energy  efficiency,  reinforcing  institutions  and  private \nsector  participation,  capacity  support,  and  regulatory  strengthening.11 It  underscores  an  urgent \nneed  to  construct  indigenous generation  (gas,  coal,  and hydropower).12 However,  as  domestic \nprojects  will  take  time  to  develop  (footnote  4),  high  reliance  on  imports  will  continue  in  the \nmedium term. Building a 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission ring to connect major load centers would \naccelerate electrification rate in  major load centers and cities. The road map also stresses the \nphased development of renewable energy projects in 15 off-grid provinces,13 development and \ncertification of gas reserves, and rehabilitation of existing gas wells to support anchor loads and \nenergy-intensive industries, as identified in the gas development master plan.14 \n \n8. \nADB  assistance  and  country  partnership  strategy.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  on-budget  development  partner  in  the  sector,  with  cumulative \ngrant  assistance  of  nearly  $937  million.  ADB-assisted  projects  have  commissioned  more  than \n630  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines,  eight  substations,  15,000 new  power  connections, \nand  eight  gas  wells  to  produce  2  million  cubic  meters  of  gas  per  day.  Other  projects  under \nimplementation  include  nearly  400  km  of  transmission  lines,  four  substations,  110,000 new \nconnections,  and  a  hydropower  project  to  generate  4.5  MW.  Additional  support  has  been \nprovided  to  strengthen  operations  and  maintenance,  projects  preparation,  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  ADB-assisted  ongoing  energy  MFF,  approved  in  2008  and  with  a  closing \ndate  on  28  November  2018,  is  fully  committed,  showing  satisfactory  results,  with  some \nimplementation lag caused by insecurity, capacity constraints, and procurement difficulties.15  \n \n9. \nThe proposed MFF is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015, \nand is included in Afghanistan\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, which prioritizes \ninfrastructure  development,  and  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  strategy, \nwhich promotes regional cooperation and energy trade.16 The MFF is designed with the lessons \nlearned from ADB-financed energy sector interventions in Afghanistan. These include the need \nto (i) finance security, demining, and taxes as part of project costs; (ii) streamline procurement \nand implementation through turnkey contracting; and (iii) provide flexible tranches to match the \nemerging  sector  needs.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW),  the  policy  and  regulatory \nbody,  is  being  strengthened  by  financing  from  United  States  government  funds.  The \n\n                                                \n11  The NESP has an investment plan of $10.1 billion, of which $7.3 billion is for generation and network integration, \n\n$1.7 billion for major transmission links, and $1.1 billion for subtransmission and distribution in provinces. \n\n12  Gas  and  coal  power  plants  are  envisaged  to  be  developed  by  the  private  sector,  and  development  partners  are \n\nassisting in rehabilitating existing and constructing new hydro plants. \n\n13  ADB.  2014.

The ADB-assisted Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy \nhas  been  vital  in  coordinating  and  streamlining  sector  investments  and  capacity  development \nassistance.19 The  MFF  comprises  priority  NESP  projects  that  have  been  agreed  at  the  Inter-\nMinisterial Commission for Energy and approved by the Office of the President of Afghanistan. \n \n11. \nInvestment  program.  Nearly  $10.1  billion\u2014funded  by  the  government,  development \npartners,  and  the  private  sector  under  the  NESP\u2014is  needed  by  2032  to  support  economic \ngrowth of 10% and to reduce poverty by 3% per year.20 The MFF, through ADB and Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) financing of up to $1.2 billion, will be implemented countrywide \nto  support  (i)  energy  infrastructure  improvements,  operations,  and  maintenance;  (ii) feasibility \nstudies and designs; and (iii) human resource development and institutional reform.21  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  MFF  will  be  improved  access  to  sustainable  energy  supplies  across \n\n12. \nAfghanistan. The outcome will be increased supply of imported and indigenous power. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe  MFF  will  have  five  outputs:  (i)  new  500  kV  and  220  kV  power  transmission  lines, \npower  distribution  networks,  and  high-voltage,  direct-current,  back-to-back  convertor  station \ncommissioned;  (ii)  renewable  energy  projects  constructed;  (iii)  domestic  gas  production  and \nimported  volume  of  natural  gas from TAPI gas pipeline  increased;  (iv)  project  preparation and \nmanagement  capacity  of  energy  ministries  and  agencies  improved;  and  (v)  Da  Afghanistan \nBreshna  Sherkat (DABS)  business plan,  and  tariff model  and framework developed.  The  MFF \nwill finance nonphysical interventions, particularly capacity and governance support, and sector \nreforms, under (iv) and (v). Additional capacity gaps and sector issues identified under (v), will \nbe addressed in subsequent tranches. \n \n14. \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  will  finance:  (i)  306  km  of  500  kV  transmission  line  from \nSheberghan  to  Dashte  Alwan;  (ii)  65  km  of  220  kV  transmission  line  from  Andkhoy  to \nSheberghan; (iii) analytical studies, particularly the development of a business plan, and a tariff \n\n                                                \n17 The  sector  investment  road  map  and  policy  framework  are  discussed  in  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement    \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n18  More than 80% of the Afghan development budget is financed through grants from development partners. \n19  ADB.  2013.

By  2018, \nTurkmenistan  will  add  1,570  MW  of  gas-to-power  generation  capacity,  and  the  500  kV \ntransmission  line  inside  Turkmenistan  to the  Afghan  border  is  completed.  The  PPSA  between \nAfghanistan  and  Turkmenistan\u2014which  includes  tariff,  volumes,  and  penalties\u2014was  signed  in \nNovember  2015.  The  demand  forecast  in  Afghanistan,  confirmed  by  the  power  master  plan, \njustifies the construction of a 500 kV transmission line to enable asynchronous interconnection \nwith Turkmenistan. The requisite load flow studies were conducted in 2013\u20132014 to confirm the \n500 kV  alternating  current  connection.  Ongoing  investments  are  adequate  to  evacuate  and \ndisperse this power across Afghanistan. The 220 kV transmission line would also enable power \nevacuation  from  domestic  gas  to  power  generation  plants  in  northern  Afghanistan.  Similar \nanalysis  will  be  undertaken  for  projects  proposed  under  subsequent  tranches.  International \ncontractors are under procurement on other ADB and development partner-assisted projects to \nimplement 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, as well as converter stations in Afghanistan. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic and financial analyses will be undertaken for each tranche under the MFF. For \n21. \ntranche 1, the analysis considered both transmission lines as one undertaking; these lines will \nbe interconnected with another ADB-assisted project that is connected to the Turkmenistan grid. \nTherefore, overall incremental benefits are taken as a whole. Among the benefits identified by \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe financial analysis are additional revenues from incremental sales by the construction of new \ntransmission  lines  to  enable  power  imports  from  Turkmenistan  to  be  sold  in  Afghanistan.  The \nanalysis also found the financial internal rate of return under the base case to be 4.76%, which \ncompares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.12%.  The \nsensitivity analysis confirms robust financial sustainability and viability under adverse conditions. \n \n22. \n The economic benefits comprise the consumption of imported power by customers that \nused alternative means of power generation, such as diesel, and new consumers. The analysis \nshowed  a  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19.47%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nsuggests sufficient robustness of the project under all tested assumptions. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance    \n\n23. \nA  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  and  procurement  capacity  assessments \nwere undertaken for DABS in 2015. The FMA found that DABS has not been strictly following \nthe  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  conventions  in  compliance  with  international \naccounting  standards.  The  FMA  states  that  while  premitigation  risks  are  high  for  DABS  and \nsubstantial  for  the  investment  program,  necessary  mitigation  is  under  way.  DABS\u2019  annual \nfinancial  statements  (FY2010--FY2014)  have  been  audited  with  disclaimers  and  qualified \nopinions. Project financial statements have been prepared, audited, and submitted to ADB since \n2010.  The  2015  procurement  capacity  assessment  confirms  that  the  country\u2019s  procurement \nsystem is weak but improving. The National Procurement Authority undertakes due diligence for \nthe approval of all contract packages, and is chaired by the President of Afghanistan. DABS has \nbeen  implementing  development  partner-assisted  projects,  including  those  from  ADB  and  the \nWorld Bank, and the PMO is extremely proficient with the procurement procedures of donors. \n \n24. \nThe United States government is implementing a capacity support component in DABS \nto introduce a new accounting manual and system. Tranche 1 will (i) make use of the existing \nPMO and maintain separate project accounts, (ii) recruit an international firm to assist in project \nimplementation, (iii) establish direct payment and commitment procedures for disbursements to \ncontractors  and  consultants,  and  (iv)  require  that  DABS  engage  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB  to  audit  project  and  corporate financial  statements  annually  in  accordance \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n25. \nTranche  1  will  support  DABS  to  develop  its  business  plan,  and  tariff  model  and \nframework by 30 June 2018. Adequate financial and operational covenants will be instituted in \nsubsequent tranches, following the formulation of the business plan and the tariff model. \n \n26. \nwith the government and DABS.

Tranche 1 does not entail \ndirect impacts on affordability or operational employment opportunities. During construction, the \ncontractor  will  be  required  to  ensure  equal  opportunities  for  all  social  groups,  equal  pay  for \nequal work regardless of gender, and the prohibition of child labor. \n \n28. \nnot required.

Any  category  A  project  will  be  financed  as  a \nstand-alone  investment  project  instead  of  through  this  MFF.  DABS,  in  consultation  with  other \nexecuting agencies, has prepared the environmental review and assessment framework for the \nMFF  and  an  initial  environmental  examination report for  tranche  1,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 October 2015. The environmental impacts are envisaged as \nsite-specific and temporary, and can be mitigated through EMP implementation. Detailed public \nconsultations will be conducted, and the initial environmental examination and the EMP will be \nupdated  before  construction.  EMP  implementation  will  be  reported  through  environmental \nmonitoring reports, submitted to ADB semiannually. Environmental specialists of the consultant \nwill provide support to DABS. Initial climate change screening has rated the project risk medium, \nand the foundation design of towers will be modified to mitigate this risk. \n \n30. \nTranche  1  is  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  field  survey  found  that  no  ethnic \nminority, as defined by the safeguard policy, is involved or affected. The project is category B for \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the  preliminary  project  design,  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  framework  for  the  MFF  and  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  for \ntranche 1 have been prepared in consultation with affected households. These documents were \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  20  October  2015,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. Nearly 368 households (3,312 people) will be directly or indirectly affected. However, \nonly 19 households are likely to experience severe impacts of physical displacement. Once the \ncontractor completes the detailed design, DABS will update the LARP and submit it to ADB for \napproval. No civil works will start until DABS has fully implemented the LARP. Implementation of \nthe LARP will be monitored semiannually, with reports submitted to ADB for its review. \n \n31. \nDABS  will  develop  and  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  agreed  with  ADB  to  rectify \nany  default  on  the  safeguard  requirements  covenanted  in  the  legal  agreements  or  any  other \nfailure to comply with safeguards. Such reports and plans will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nMFF are expected to outweigh the costs.     \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \n\nReduced availability of \npower supply from \nTurkmenistan and lesser \ndemand potential in \nAfghanistan \nWeak financial \nmanagement capacity in \nDABS  \n\nMitigating Measures \nA power purchase and sales agreement between the two countries agrees and confirms \ntariff, volume, and penalties until 2028. Turkmenistan is adding 1,450 megawatts of new \ngas-to-power generation and has completed its 500 kV line up to the Afghan border. The \n2012\u20132032 power master plan of Afghanistan confirms adequate demand to utilize this \nimported power, and requisite downstream investments are under implementation. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  2015  finds  that  premitigation  risks  are  high  for \nDABS  and  substantial  for  the  program.  Requisite  improvements  and  restructuring  is \nunder \nimplementation  under  ongoing  ADB  investments  and  financing  by  other \ndevelopment  partners.  Moreover,  necessary  funds  have  been  provided  and  reforms \nhave  been  covenanted  in  this  program  to  address  these  issues.  All  procurement  and \nconsultant recruitment will require the prior approval of ADB. \n\n                                                \n30  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nDelays in procurement \nand implementation and \ndeteriorating security \nleading to cost overruns \n\nGovernance and capacity \nissues could negatively \naffect the project. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProcurement packaging will be minimized with turnkey contract packages. Qualified \ninternational contractors and consultants are implementing 500 kV systems in \nAfghanistan. An international consulting firm will be recruited under the project to support \nprocurement activities. Adequate funds are budgeted for contingencies, including \nproviding and financing of security plans at project sites. \nProcurement oversight is complemented by a complaint review mechanism with the \ngovernment\u2019s National Procurement Authority and through access to procurement-\nrelated information via government websites. ADB\u2019s ongoing multitranche financing \nfacility is providing capacity support to DABS in its technical, financial and economic, \nsocial safeguards, and procurement functions. This has instituted adequate systems in \nprogram management. Requisite training and capacity support component for DABS has \nbeen built in multitranche financing facility to manage 500 kV transmission system. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DABS = Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (Afghanistan power utility), kV = kilovolt. \nSources: Afghanistan Energy Information Center, quarterly reports of the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\nThe  government,  including  MEW,  MOMP,  and  DABS,  have  assured  ADB  that \n33. \nimplementation  of  the  Energy  Supply  Improvement  Investment  Program  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  FAM \nand the grant documents. \n \n34. \nThe  government,  including  MEW,  MOMP,  and  DABS  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.
