A  major  change  in  the  Khadi  Reform  and  Development  Program  (KRDP  or  the \nProgram)1 is  proposed  for  Board  consideration.2 The  consequent  revisions  to  the  second \ntranche and a related progress report on its implementation are also submitted for Board \nconsideration. The brief background leading to the need for this major changes and the change \nproposed in line with the Government of India\u2019s request is summarized below and covered in \ndetail in subsequent sections.  \n \n2.  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The major changes are: \n(i)  the loan of $150 million to India for the program to be reduced to $105 million;3 \n(ii)  the number of tranches for the program is reduced from four to three and the \nbalance of $85 million to be released in two tranches of $40 million for the \nsecond tranche and $45 million for the third tranche; \n(iii)  the total number of policy conditions for the release of tranches to be reduced \nfrom 90 to 66 inclusive of the first tranche (first tranche: 16 conditions; second \ntranche: 32 conditions from earlier 31; third tranche: 18 conditions from earlier \n26; and fourth tranche: nil from 17 earlier); \n(iv)  the policy conditions relating to the setting up of a marketing organization with \nmajority private sector ownership and private sector participation in central sliver \nplants (CSPs) of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) have been \ndropped from the program as they are not feasible due to inadequate interest \nfrom the private sector; \n(v)  to carry out the restructured program, the closing date to be extended to 31 \nDecember 2017; and \n \n3.  The attached technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Reforming the Khadi \nand Village Industry Subsector in India will be extended until 31 December 2017 and aligned \nwith the restructured program implementation requirements (para. 21).4 \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n4.  The government, as part of its 11th Five-Year Plan (FY2007\u20132012), sought to increase \nemployment in the rural nonfarm sector (RNS). The government identified khadi and village \nindustries  (KVI)  as  one  with  significant  prospects  for  employment.  Upon  request  from  the \ngovernment, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved on 2 \nOctober  2008  the  program  to  support  the  government's  efforts  for  enhancing  income  and \nemployment growth in the KVI subsector through a $150 million loan. \n \n                                                 \n1  Khadi and village industries (KVI), originally promoted by Mahatma Gandhi in the 1920s for rural self-employment, \nform a significant subsector of the rural nonfarm sector (RNS). Khadi is handspun and handwoven cloth. The raw \nmaterials (cotton, silk, or wool) are spun and woven on hand-spinning wheels called charkha and woven on \nhandlooms. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Program Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Khadi Reform and Development Program. \nManila (Loan 2452-IND, approved on 2 October 2008, made effective on 2 February 2010). \n3  The costing for the program elements estimated based on major changes in scope and prevailing cost. In case the \nBoard approves the proposed major change, a consequent reduction in the loan size (i.e., $45 million) would be \nprocessed in accordance with ADB. 1982. Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations. Section 9.02. Manila. \n4  If the Board approves the major change in the Program and release of the revised second tranche, then extension \nand  alignment  of  the  TA  would  be  processed  for  approval  in  accordance  with  the  Project  Administration \nInstructions. The third tranche is expected to be completed in December 2017. ", "2 \n5.  The Government of India and ADB signed the loan on 22 December 2009 and it became \neffective on 2 February 2010. The loan was to be released in four tranches within 3 years as per \nthe following schedule: tranche 1 (16 conditions) for $20 million; tranche 2 (31 conditions) from \n8 months of tranche 1 for $40 million; tranche 3 (26 conditions) from 13 months of tranche 2 for \n$40 million; and tranche 4 (17 conditions) from 15 months of tranche 3 for $50 million. \n \n6.  The loan of $150 million financed from the ADB ordinary capital resources was provided \nunder the London interbank offered rate-based (LIBOR) lending facility to the government. The \nloan has a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate to be \ndetermined in accordance with LIBOR, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the signed loan agreement. \n \n7.  The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MMSME) is the executing agency, \nand KVIC is the implementing agency for the program. A dedicated Reform Implementation \nDivision (RID) was set up at the KVIC in October 2009 and reform management units (RMUs) \nwere established at the state and division level to implement the program in July 2010 as per \nthe program requirement. The RID is responsible for overall monitoring and for coordinating \nactions under the program. RMUs are program implementing units responsible at the state and \ndivision level. In 2008, the Reform Implementation and Monitoring Committee at MMSME was \nformed to serve as the program steering committee. \n \n8.  Impact and outcome. The enhancement of income and employment growth for the \nRNS is the impact envisaged from the program. The outcome is to revitalize the KVI subsector \nwith  an  enhanced  sustainability  of  khadi,  increased  employment  generation  and  incomes, \nincreased artisan welfare, and developed select traditional village industries.  \n \n9.  Policy framework and actions. The program comprises (i) establishing a policy reform \nand implementation framework, (ii) promoting and marketing khadi, (iii) realizing procurement \nand production efficiencies, and (iv) implementing institutional reforms. The recommendations of \na high-level working group of the government, ADB assessment of policy and institutional \naspects  of  khadi, and  an  intensive  consultation  with  stakeholders  all  contributed  to  the \n \nestablishment and design of the program.   \n \n10.  Performance indicators. The key performance targets and indicators developed for the \nprogram include a 15% increase in artisans employed by khadi institutions, 20% increase in the \nprevailing earnings, 10% increase in sales on an annual compounded basis, 15% reduction in \nraw material (sliver) production cost, and 10 new ventures to be initiated in the khadi subsector \nunder a producer company and/or entrepreneurial model.5 It also required KVIC to disengage \nfrom direct commercial activities, specifically from marketing and sliver production; implement a \ncomprehensive reform plan for 300 eligible khadi institutions; strengthen information technology \n(IT) and e-governance systems and practices of KVIC; and implement a cluster development \nstrategy in five traditional village industries. \n \n11.  A TA grant from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, in the \namount of $2 million was attached to the program. The goal of the TA is to support the \nimplementation of the khadi reform package and its objective is to expedite the commencement \nof the reforms. The TA consisted of supporting the executing agency and implementing agency \n                                                 \n5  In the producer company model, the institution is owned and run by the primary producers as opposed to the trust\u2013\nsociety model, where the office bearers are from outside the artisan and/or weaver fraternity. In the entrepreneurial \nmodel, individuals can start the enterprise as an entrepreneurship venture with the motivation to gain profit.  \n ", "3 \nin strengthening program management, providing support in promoting and marketing khadi, \nfacilitating procurement and production functions, and supporting institutional reforms.  \n \n12.  ADB released the first tranche of $20 million on 17 February 2010 upon satisfactory \ncompliance with policy conditions. As part of the implementation activities under the second \ntranche, the executing agency and the implementing agency substantially completed most of \nthe policy conditions except the ones related to private sector participation in the marketing \norganization and CSPs, which could not be completed despite multiple attempts to identify \nprivate sector partners through a bidding process. Further, khadi institutions' initial reluctance \nand  resistance  to  adopting  the  comprehensive  reform  program  delayed  program \nimplementation.6  \n \n13.  Despite the delay, the program yielded significant positive impact and outcomes through \na  detailed  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  process.  Some  of  the  program's \nunprecedented changes include the formulation of the \u201cKhadi Mark.\u201d The mark created a distinct \nidentity for khadi, which has been in existence since the 1920s, and notification for market \npricing, which enabled khadi institutions to sell khadi at market prices and move away from \n\u201ccost-chart\u201d principles that did not allow khadi institutions to earn profits.7 The program has also \nenabled improvement in the governance framework through greater representation of artisans \nand weavers, including at least one woman representative, in the board of khadi institutions. It \nhas also helped in improving production and reducing drudgery through modern implements, \nand increased sales through renovated modern sales outlets and monitoring through real-time \nmanagement information systems (MIS).  \n \n14.  The  program  was  originally  scheduled  for  completion  on  30  September  2011  and \nextended  several  times  to  30  September  2015.  The  government  is  keen  to  continue  the \nprogram, since the reform measures implemented are making the sector sustainable without \nbudgetary support and increasing the earnings for those employed in the sector. In this context, \nthe  government  requested  ADB,  through  a  letter  dated  17  December  2015,  to  waive  the \nrequirement of meeting the infeasible policy conditions and release the funds for the second \ntranche.  In  response,  ADB  informed  the  government  that  such  extensive  waiver  of  policy \nconditions is generally not considered.  \n \n15.  On 14 January 2016, the government organized a high-level meeting with ADB where all \noptions to revive the program were discussed.8 The meeting concluded that there was a need to \nfield ADB consultation missions to assess and explore options for the revival of the program, \nincluding restructuring. To this end, the program is currently extended to 31 December 2016. \n \nIII.  IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS \n \n16.  ADB fielded a consultation mission on 24 February 2016. The ADB mission found that \nout of 31 policy conditions for the release of the second tranche, 22 were fully complied with and \n9 were noncompliant as of 28 February 2016. The detailed review of policy action compliance9 \nand  the  detailed  performance  overview  of  the  program  components  are  attached.10 The \nsummary of implementation progress is provided in paras. 17-20.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Comprehensive reform package adopted as part of the first tranche policy condition. \n7  In the 1920s, Mahatma Gandhi formulated the cost-chart principle for the costing of khadi products. \n8  Minutes of the meeting dated 8 February 2016 set out the approach for the revival of the loan. \n9  Status of Policy Conditions as of 28 February 2016 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Performance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n17.  Policy  reform  and  implementation  framework.  The  government  formulated  a \ncomprehensive  reform  package  for  the  KVI  subsector  and  approved  the  implementation \nframework for KVIC to carry out the reforms as part of the first tranche policy conditions. \nFurther, as part of the second tranche, the executing agency (MMSME) and the implementing \nagency (KVIC) established institutional arrangements such as the Reform Implementation and \nMonitoring Committee at the national level, RID at the KVIC head office , and RMUs at the state \noffices. The KVIC conducted a series of dissemination workshops in April 2010 at the national \nand state levels to communicate and build awareness for the reform measures being taken up \nas part of the program. During the initial implementation, RID and RMUs observed a certain \ndegree of reluctance from khadi institutions. Subsequently, to understand and address the \nconcerns of khadi institutions, several state and nationwide workshops were held during the \nimplementation period (2011\u20132013). This helped in building consensus and greater acceptance \nof the policy reform and implementation framework. Overall assessment of this component is \nsatisfactory and the specific performance targets and milestones have been achieved though \ndelayed. \n \n18.  Institutional reforms. The institutional reforms component has four broad elements. \n \n(i)  Organizational restructuring. KVIC reorganized the directorates and conducted \na staffing norm study in 2008 to increase its operational effectiveness. This, in \nturn,  helped  in  bringing  greater  focus  and  accountability  among  the  KVIC \ndirectorates. It also helped in the devolution of powers to state and division \noffices for smoother and faster implementation of all the government schemes \nimplemented  by  KVIC.  As  the  institutional  reforms  required  capacity \nenhancement, KVIC, through ADB-assisted TA, carried out an assessment of \nexisting training arrangements, including infrastructure, capacity of trainers, and \ncurriculum. Based on this assessment, it developed a comprehensive capacity \nbuilding  plan  in  2011  and  put  in  place  the  annual  preparation  of  a  training \ncalendar.  To  date,  office  bearers  from  khadi  institutions  covering  over  783 \nparticipants have received training on quality testing, store operations and MIS, \nand gender mainstreaming and environmental safeguards. It also has covered \ntraining  for  about  3,000  artisans,  including  57  as  master  trainers  at  khadi \ninstitutions level, who in turn are training other artisans at their respective khadi \ninstitutions.  \n \n(ii)  Management  Information  System  (MIS)  and  information  technology \ninterventions. KVIC has initiated the development and implementation of an \nMIS for the khadi institutions to assist the khadi institutions in the management of \ntheir inventory, finance, sales, and timely reporting to KVIC. The MIS is under \npilot implementation in eight khadi institutions and a plan to rollout of MIS to 30 \nkhadi institutions was prepared on 28 February 2016. KVIC developed an e-\ngovernance and IT road map through an ADB-assisted TA, which will eventually \nintegrate all the IT systems used by the KVI subsector.  \n \n(iii)  Direct reform assistance. KVIC conducted in FY2012 a management audit of \n73 khadi institutions to ascertain their institutional ability to absorb the direct \nreform  assistance  (DRA)  provided  under  the  program.  A  total  of  54  khadi \ninstitutions were found to be eligible for DRA, of which only 38 khadi institutions \nsigned a memorandum of understanding with KVIC for adopting the khadi reform \npackage.  On  28  February  2016,  KVIC  achieved  a  fund  disbursement  of  $1 \n ", "5 \nmillion,  which  was  used  to  provide  3,806  new  model  charkhas11 and  251 \nhandlooms, build 38 central facility centers and work sheds, and renovate 164 \nsales outlets of khadi institutions. Since the program impact of this component \nseemed  to  be  significant,  ADB  requested  KVIC  to  carry  out  an  impact \nassessment.  \n \n(iv)  Traditional village industries. This element of the program required KVIC to \nconduct a diagnostic survey of five identified traditional village industries12 under \nthe first tranche and formulate a cluster development strategy for them to achieve \nsynergy with the initiatives carried out for the khadi subsector. KVIC appointed \nfive technical agencies in 2011 to conduct the diagnostic study, prepare the \ndetailed  project  report,  and  provide  need-based  technical  support  for  the \nrespective clusters. The identified clusters were appraised and a comprehensive \nsustainability index was developed based on parameters related to the potential \nfor  employment  generation,  scope  for  business  expansion,  ease  of \nimplementation, and sustainability. Post-shortlisting of clusters and implementing \nagencies were identified and now the cluster development implementation is \nunderway in the bee-keeping cluster.13 Overall assessment of the institutional \nreforms  component  is  satisfactory  and  the  specific  performance  targets  and \nmilestones set have been achieved with some delay in the DRA component. \n \n19.  Promoting and marketing of khadi. The promotion and marketing of khadi reforms \ncomponent has two elements.  \n \n(i)  Khadi Mark. The program required KVIC to develop the Khadi Mark, including a \nlogo, to provide a distinct identity for genuine khadi, and the registration of the \nKhadi Mark under the Trade Mark Act.14 During implementation, it was found that \nthere was a legal impediment in registering the mark under the Trade Mark Act \nuntil KVIC was engaged in commercial activities of production and marketing of \nkhadi. To achieve the intended reform objective, MMSME formulated the Khadi \nMark  Regulation  2013  by  drawing  powers  from  the  KVIC  Act  1956.  The \nregulation,  along  with  the  logo,  was  published  in  July  2013  in  the  central \ngovernment  gazette  and  posted  in  the  upper  house  of  the  Parliament.  The \nregulation provides KVIC the right to act against persons infringing on its specific \nprovisions,  which  includes  the  sale  of  spurious  khadi  and  the  sale  of  khadi \nwithout a Khadi Mark logo. The required guidelines, protocols, committees for \nmanaging issues related to the Khadi Mark, and testing infrastructure have also \nbeen announced by KVIC. A total of 1,468 working khadi institutions have been \nregistered for the Khadi Mark as of 28 February 2016. While there is a deviation \nfrom the original policy condition, the executing agency and the implementing \nagency were able to achieve the intended reform objective through the Khadi \nMark Regulation 2013. It is also being recognized as one of the far-reaching \nreform achievements of the program. \n \n                                                 \n11 A charkha is a domestic spinning wheel. New model charkhas have eight spindles and help produce more yarn \nwith the same effort as the old charkhas. \n12 The five industries identified  were herbal products, honey, handmade paper, leather, and agro-based food \nprocessing. \n13 Details regarding shortlisting can be found on the KVIC website in activities under KRDP. http://kvic.org.in. \n14 Section 70 of the Trade Mark Act required the certifying organization to be completely disengaged from the value \nchain. \n ", "6 \n(ii)  Marketing organization. The program required KVIC to identify private partners \nand set up a marketing organization with a majority shareholding by a private \npartner and to disengage from the marketing function. The KVIC and MMSME \nconducted a bidding twice to identify private partners but received no response.15 \nKVIC was also required to undertake a market assessment survey to aid the \nmarketing  initiatives  with  support  from  the  marketing  organization.  As  the \nestablishment  of  the  marketing  organization  was  delayed  and  found  to  be \ninfeasible, KVIC commissioned the market survey with support from an ADB-\nassisted TA. The market survey was completed in 2011 and its outputs are being \nused to rationalize the product categories and as an input for promoting the \nKhadi Mark. Since it was not possible to set up a marketing organization through \nprivate sector participation, the executing agency and the implementing agency \nare taking the reform interventions originally planned to be carried out by the \nmarketing organization through the marketing directorate with support from khadi \ninstitutions. Overall assessment for this component is not satisfactory. While the \nspecific performance targets and milestones set for the Khadi Mark have been \nachieved with deviations, the targets and milestones related to the marketing \norganization has not been achieved. A detailed analysis of this component is \nincluded in the performance overview.16    \n \n20.  Revitalizing procurement and production efficiencies. This reform component has \nfour elements. \n \n(i)  Raw  material  procurement  and  cotton  sliver  production.  The  program \nrequired KVIC to train khadi institutions on quality testing of raw material and to \nexecute  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  agreements  in  two  CSPs.  KVIC \nconducted training for 300 master trainers from 300 khadi institutions in April \n2011. KVIC initiated the process of identifying private partners through a bidding \nprocess for two CSPs (Etah and Sehore) in 2011 but did not get any response \nfrom the market. In formal consultations, potential private sector players indicated \nthat sliver and roving,17 which are intermediary products of the textile value chain \nand produced by low-capacity plants, were of little interest to the private sector. \nBased on this feedback, the bidding framework was revised to include potential \npartners from the khadi subsector and two CSPs (Raebareilly and Chitradurga) \nwere put out for bidding in 2013. Only one response from an existing khadi \ninstitution was received for the Chitradurga CSP, which could not be considered \nbased on KVIC procurement rules. Therefore, this policy condition is infeasible to \nachieve.  The  detailed  analysis  on  this  component  is  described  in  the \nperformance overview (footnote 15).    \n \n(ii)  Market-linked pricing. As mandated by the program, KVIC is required to allow \nkhadi institutions to set market-linked prices and formulate a benefits chart for \nsharing  the  surplus  among  stakeholders.  KVIC  introduced  the  market-linked \npricing  in  July  2010  when  it  announced  a  market  development  assistance \nscheme under which the khadi institutions were allowed to move from the earlier \n                                                 \n15 The first bidding process was initiated in 2011 and the second bidding process in 2013. Details are provided in the \nPerformance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Performance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n17 Sliver and roving are intermediary products between cotton and yarn in the textile value chain and are only used by \nthe khadi subsector for hand spinning to convert into yarns. No interest exists from other textile manufacturers for \nthis product. \n ", "7 \nexisting cost\u2500chart principle to a market-based flexible pricing. This scheme is \naimed  at  generating  maximum  surplus  for  the  artisans  as  well  as  for  the \ninstitutions,  and  implementing  market-linked  pricing.  KVIC  publicized  the \nguidelines for the benefit chart in 2011, which aims to ensure that surpluses, \ngenerated by the shift to market-linked pricing, and expected increases in the \nprice realization through proposed product and marketing reforms are shared \nwith artisans and weavers. Market-linked pricing is one of the critical changes \ntransforming the sector, providing an opportunity to redistribute profits for the \nbenefit  of  the  stakeholders.  The  overall  assessment  of  this  element  of  the \nprogram is satisfactory.   \n \n(iii)  Rationalization  of  financial  assistance.  This  element  required  KVIC  to \nformulate the production incentive plan, reassess the working capital requirement \nfor khadi production, and appoint a focal person to engage with the bankers to \nenhance the access of khadi institutions to the formal banking sector. KVIC \nalready introduced and initiated the implementation of the Production Incentive \nPlan in 2011. Under the plan, KVIC will help khadi institutions categorize their \nproducts and avail financial assistance on specific categories of khadi products, \nwhich require fiscal support to increase the competitiveness. KVIC reassessed \nthe  working  capital  requirement  and  initiated  actions  to  reduce  the  blocked \nworking capital by reducing the debtor days of CSPs and ensure prompt payment \nfor the sale of finished goods. It has also appointed a focal person to help khadi \ninstitutions to access bank funds. The implementation of this element has helped \nbring efficiency in utilizing government funds and subsidies. The overall progress \nunder this element is satisfactory but has been slow in pace. \n \n(iv)  New khadi ventures. This element required KVIC to develop the framework for \na producer company model and an enterprise model for new ventures in khadi. \nKVIC developed and issued the framework for forming khadi ventures through a \nproducer company model. This was meant to increase artisan empowerment, as \ngovernance  and  management  of  such  ventures  would  consist  of  primary \nproducers  (artisans,  spinners,  and  weavers).  At  awareness  workshops  to \npromote  these  models,  investors  indicated  their  concern  that  there  was \ninadequate  support  from  the  government  to  incentivize  these  models.  To \nimplement  these  models  in  a  subsequent  tranche,  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies decided to mainstream this activity through the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Employment  Generation  Program  and  the  Scheme  of  Fund  for \nRegeneration  of  Traditional  Industries,18 which  provide  incentives  to  such \nventures. The overall assessment of this element of program is satisfactory; \nhowever, the executing agency has proposed to remove this from the ambit of \nthe program and pursue it under other schemes. \n \n21.  The  ADB-assisted  TA  has  been  supporting  the  program  implementation  since \nSeptember 2010. The TA of $2 million is financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \nand was originally scheduled to close on 30 September 2011. However, it has been extended \nfive times up to 31 December 2016 in line with the extension of the underlying program. Out of \nthe total TA amount of $2 million, $1.84 million (92%) has been committed and $1.32 million \n(65%) has been disbursed. The delay in the implementation and extension of the program from \n                                                 \n18 ADB is considering a loan for the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries to cover 800 \ntraditional village industry clusters. The design activities will be included in the proposed loan.  \n ", "8 \nthe  earlier  envisaged  3  years  to  the  current  period  of  more  than  6  years  will  require  a \nrealignment of TA inputs and its extension to meet the current requirements of accelerating the \nimplementation  activities  and  focus  on  key  interventions  of  the  DRA,  and  MIS  and  IT \nimplementation. The TA will consist of the following components until its extended period by 31 \nDecember 2017: \n(i)  Support program management.  The TA will continue to support MMSME and \nKVIC in the overall management, implementation, and monitoring of the program. \n(ii)  Promote the Khadi Mark. The implementation of the Khadi Mark requires TA \nsupport in monitoring and supporting the development of promotional activities. \n(iii)  Support institutional reforms. The TA needs to continue to support KVIC and \nkhadi institutions through the assistance provided in training and development \nactivities.  \n(iv)  Implement  the  management  information  system  and  information \ntechnology.  The  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  MIS  in  300  khadi \ninstitutions and the program management of integrated IT system implementation \nwithin KVIC. \n(v)  Support the direct reform assistance. The TA will support the accelerated \nimplementation of DRA to the remaining 320 khadi institutions by 31 December \n2017. \n(vi)  Monitor the progress of the village industry clusters.  The TA will extend its \nsupport to monitoring the implementation progress in the five village industry \nclusters and managing the program of the implementation agency.  \n \n22.  Based on this assessment by the ADB consultation mission, the Government of India \nformally requested ADB to restructure and revive the program. ADB fielded multiple consultation \nmissions during March\u2013May 2016 to arrive at optimal restructuring and feasible policy options \naligned to the current context. The revision of policy conditions involved a greater focus on \nDRA, increasing the beneficiary khadi institutions from 300 to 400 and removing the infeasible \nPPP policy conditions discussed in para. 19(ii) and para. 20(i). This suggestion required the \nreview of the program structure to rationalize its three tranches and the reduction of policy \nconditions from 90 to 66. Based on these, the costs associated with the suggested policy \nconditions  were  reworked  and  the  total  program  cost  is  now  estimated  at  $105  million. \nAccordingly, the loan amount is proposed to be changed to $105 million and structured to be \ndisbursed in three tranches with revised policy conditions as described in para. 2. With this, on \nMay 2016, the Government of India requested to initiate the restructuring process at the earliest.    \n \n23.  ADB's South Asia Department management approved the program review mission19 to \ninitiate discussions with the government on the proposed restructuring program and progress \nmade in achieving the revised policy conditions. Based on this, the government submitted a \nrevised development policy letter on 22 July 2016. The revised policy conditions of the program \nand the current compliance status as of 30 September 2016 are in the Revised Policy Matrix \nand Revised Policy Conditions based on the Revised Policy Matrix.20  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 The first review mission was conducted on 29 June\u20137 July 2016 and the second review mission on 17 August\u201324 \nAugust 2016. \n20 Revised Policy Matrix and Revised Policy Conditions based on the Revised Policy Matrix (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). All 32 Tranche 2 conditions have been fully complied with. \n ", "9 \nIV.  RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES \n \n24.  The  program  has  brought  far-reaching  changes  to  the  KVI  sector  and  impacted \npositively on the lives of more than 1 million artisans and their families employed in the khadi \nsubsector.  Some of these changes include increased earnings21 due to market-linked pricing, \nfinancial inclusion due to mandatory direct benefit transfers through bank accounts,22 increased \nproduction and sales through the support of DRA, increased empowerment and representation \nin the decision-making of khadi institutions, and capacity building in new technology and trends. \nThe program also brought efficiency to the sector and is helping the government rationalize the \nfinancial support and bring sustainability to the sector, without budgetary support.  \n   \n25.  However, the program's earlier design relied heavily on private sector participation to \naddress the efficiency and productivity issues in the sector. The market was not ready for it; this \nwas reflected in the lukewarm response to the process initiated for identifying private partners \nfor the marketing organization and CSPs. The program design also dwelled into specific micro-\nlevel actions within components with 90 policy conditions (spread over four tranches) rather \nthan focusing on larger policy-level actions. This led to lesser flexibility available for program \nimplementation and in turn impacted the freedom available to the implementing agency for \nadopting interventions, which were more contextual and pragmatic.23 \n   \n26.  As such, program implementation is delayed. Nevertheless, both the executing agency \nand the implementing agency are committed to and remain diligent in implementing the program \nand continue to look for ways to take the program forward. However, external market factors \nmade compliance to policy conditions related to the marketing organization, CSP, and the new \nkhadi ventures infeasible.  \n \n27.  The government is committed to reform and intends to carry out the reform agenda with \nthe public sector in the absence of an active interest from the private sector. The MMSME has \nreiterated its desire to continue the reform agenda in the sector with the public sector without \ncompromising the intent and objectives originally envisaged under the program, as discussed \nwith the ADB team.  \n \n28.  ADB has played a critical role as a catalyst and facilitator supporting the reform agenda \nin this traditional sector since its conceptualization in 2008. Given the continued commitment \nand interest of the government, ADB may continue to play the role of facilitating this change \nthrough a restructured program, which is more contextual and aligned to the current social and \neconomic environment. \n \nV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Economic  and  sector.  The  original  due  diligence  conducted  as  part  of  the  loan \napproval remains intact. The employment generation in the RNS, including the KVI subsector, \n                                                 \n21 A summary of an initial program impact assessment has been done as part of the revised policy conditions under \nthe second tranche. \n22 The program pioneered the transfer of benefit to artisans and weavers through a bank account, which was later \nsubsumed within a larger financial inclusion agenda of the Government of India, including Jan Dhan Yojna \n(financial inclusion scheme), through a universal identification using biometrics. \n23  For instance, the Khadi Mark was specifically required to be registered under the Trade Mark Act whereas the \ncurrent Khadi Mark regulation notified under the KVIC Act has achieved the same reform objective. In the case of a \nmarketing organization, PPP was to be done as a joint venture with majority private sector shareholding, which \nprecluded other options like management contract, concession, and franchising. \n ", "10 \nhas  been  impacted  by  the  macroeconomic  changes  and  new  schemes,  specifically  the \nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,24 which was expanded to all rural \nareas by 2008.25  \n \n30.  Governance. The program continues to address governance issues originally envisaged \nunder the program. The mainstreaming of financial inclusion and direct benefit transfer scheme \nwill help in further strengthening the governance of KVIs in the central and state-level and \nartisan welfare since the fund transfer mechanism is transparent and the artisans are able to \nrealize the benefits in short duration. \n \n31.  Poverty and social. The results of the original due diligence conducted as part of the \nloan approval remain valid. The program will provide significant socioeconomic and gender-\nrelated impacts to women involved in the khadi subsector. Increased benefits will accrue from \nthe  enhanced  scope  of  the  DRA,  which  will  increase  coverage  from  300  to  400  khadi \ninstitutions. Women, who constitute 80% of the workers in the sector, will benefit from the \nintervention in terms of increased production, value addition to products, and increased sale \nfrom the renovated retail sales outlets.  \n \n32.  Environment. The original due diligence conducted as part of the loan approval remains \nvalid. An environmental assessment of the policy matrix had indicated no potential adverse \nenvironmental impact. The environment is a category C. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCE  \n \n33.  Based  on  the  revised  development  policy  letter  and  revised  policy  matrix  for  the \nprogram,  the  government  has  provided  revised  assurances  that  are  incorporated  in  the \namended and restated loan agreement. \n \nVII.  TRANCHE 2 RELEASE STATUS \n \n34.  As described in detail in the Status of Policy Conditions as of 28 February 2016,26 the \nconditions for revised tranche 2 are fully complied with.   \n \nVIII.
