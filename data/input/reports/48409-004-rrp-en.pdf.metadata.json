It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  farmers  and \nagribusinesses  for  climate-smart  agriculture  (CSA),  and  create  an  enabling  environment  for \nclimate-friendly agribusinesses to promote sustainability along the value chain. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nSector performance. The Human Development Index report ranks the Lao PDR as 138th \n3. \nout  of  188  countries.2  Macroeconomic  and  political  stability  enabled  it  to  achieve  moderate \neconomic  growth  at  6.5%  per  annum  during  1986\u22122016.3  However,  the  country  also  grappled \nwith a persistent current account deficit, falling foreign currency reserves, and growing public debt. \nAlthough the contribution of agriculture to the national gross domestic product is declining (from \n32.7% in 2010 to 19.8% in 2016), the economy still remains agrarian: about 65% of the working \npopulation  is  employed  in  the  sector.  Low  sector  growth  led  to  low  levels  of  rural  household \nincomes. The poverty rate of those engaged in agriculture is nearly three times higher than for \nthose working in other sectors (footnote 3). \n\n4. \nDevelopment challenges. Various physical, environmental, socioeconomic, and capacity \nbarriers constrain sector  productivity  and profitability,  notably  poor  infrastructure,  low  technical \ncapacity, and unfavorable policies.4 Farming remains mostly subsistence and rain-fed. Although \n3.8 million hectares are potentially suitable for cultivation, the irrigated area is limited to 0.3 million \nhectares as of 2016 (footnote 3). Access roads to rural markets and logistics infrastructure are of \nlow quality, contributing to high distribution costs. About 90% of the paddy in the country are milled \nin small processing units with old and obsolete equipment. Limited availability of climate-resilient \nvarieties,  low  capacity  of farmers  for  adopting  climate-friendly  practices and  technologies,  and \nlimited  access  for  smallholder  farmers  to  affordable  credit  also  hamper  the  transition  from \nsubsistence farming to commercial agriculture. The steady migration of young people to urban \nareas left behind an aging and declining labor force, yet farm mechanization remains limited. \n\n5. \nA policy environment characterized by onerous registration requirements, a gap between \nlegislation  and  implementation,  and  conflicting  regulations  are  key  barriers  for  agribusiness. \n\n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 2015. Agriculture Development Strategy to 2025 \nand Vision to the Year 2030. Vientiane. Target provinces and commodities were selected based on agribusiness \npotential, inclusiveness, climate vulnerability, and government priorities. \n\n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2017. United Nations Human Development Report 2017. New York. \n3  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.  Lao  PDR:  Accelerating  structural  transformation  for  inclusive  growth  \u2013 \n\n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (accessible from the list of \n\nCountry diagnostic study. Manila. \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fPrivate  sector  participation  remains  limited,  leading  to  low  investments  by  farms  in  innovative \ntechnologies.  Low  capacity  for  value  addition  and  underdeveloped  marketing  systems  also \ncontribute to low competitiveness. The Lao PDR ranked 141th out of 190 countries on ease of \ndoing business.5 This unfavorable environment leaves the Lao PDR with underdeveloped value \nchains, farmers with limited market options, and the economy with poor capacity for adding value \nto the primary commodities that it produces. \n\n6. \nThe Lao PDR is highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change such as increased floods \nand  droughts.  Climate  projections  suggest  that  daily  maximum  temperatures  may  increase  by \n2\u00b0C\u20133\u00b0C  by  2050,  especially  in the south,  and exacerbate the  severity of  droughts.6  Likewise, \nrainfall  is  projected  to  increase  by  10%\u201330%  during  the  rainy  season  in  southern  provinces, \nthereby increasing flooding. Poor adaptation measures and low adaptive capacity increase the \nvulnerability of rural livelihoods and lead to food insecurity. \n\n7. \nOpportunities.  Investing  in  climate-friendly  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure, \ncoupled with targeted capacity strengthening and policy support, is vital to overcome the above \nbarriers. Intensive production and commercialization of high-quality rice and organic vegetables, \nfacilitated by local biofertilizer production and clean agricultural technologies, can increase rural \nhousehold  incomes,  cut  fertilizer  imports,  and  save  foreign  exchange.  Opportunities  exist  for \ndeveloping agribusinesses that cater to domestic and export markets, and for mobilizing private \nsector  investment  in  areas  such  as  infrastructure  for  storage,  processing  and  value  addition, \nbiofertilizer  production,  and  organic  agriculture.  The  demand  for  a  wider  range  of  safe  and \nnutritious food by a growing base of domestic urban middle-class consumers and tourists also \nprovides  opportunities  for  public\u2013private\u2013community  partnerships  that  could  lead  to  improved \nmarket  efficiency  and  inclusive  agribusiness  value  chains.  Investments  in  climate-friendly \nagribusiness will also strengthen the finance sector, as the demand for farm credit will increase. \n\n8. \nGovernment\u2019s efforts. The government aims to increase the agricultural growth rate to \n3.4% per annum by 2020. The policy framework for the agriculture sector is set out in (i) the ADS \nto 2025 (footnote 1); (ii) the 8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u2013\n2020);  (iii)  the  Development  Strategy  of  the  Crop  Sector  2025  and  Vision  2030;  and  (iv)  the \nNational  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  of Lao  PDR.7 The  ADS  aims to  (i) ensure food  security; \n(ii) produce  competitive commodities with  a  comparative advantage; (iii)  develop  a  clean,  safe \nand  sustainable  agriculture;  and  (iv)  shift  gradually  to  the  modernization  into  a  resilient  and \nproductive agricultural economy. \n\nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  project  includes  innovations  such  as  (i)  improved  design \n9. \nstandards  of  rural  infrastructure to make it  climate-resilient  and more sustainable,  (ii)  adoption \nand expanded use of advanced CSA technologies and practices, and (iii) promotion of regional \ncooperation and integration in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) through harmonization of \nstandards and support to regional seed-trading agreements. Through this project, ADB aims to \nfinance key elements of the ADS through support to rice, the most important crop, and vegetables, \nthe subsector with the greatest potential for increasing rural incomes. The project will contribute \nto the government\u2019s target of 4.7 million tons of paddy production with 2 million tons of quality rice \nearmarked for domestic and export markets.

Building on public\u2013private\u2013community \npartnership  models  developed  by  earlier  ADB  projects,  the  project  will  promote  private  sector \nparticipation  in  value  chain  operations,  diversify  livelihood  options,  and  assist  smallholders\u2019 \ntransition from subsistence to commercial agriculture.8 By improving the capacity for quality and \nsafety testing, the project will enable farmers to access high-value markets within and beyond the \nGMS.  The  project  complements  initiatives  on  trade  facilitation  and  the  GMS  Core  Agriculture \nSupport Program.9  \n\n10. \nDevelopment coordination and lessons learned. The project will coordinate with (i) the \nWorld Bank in the implementation of a matching grant scheme for agribusinesses; (ii) the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in supporting vegetable farmer groups; and \n(iii) the International Rice Research Institute in deploying climate-resilient varieties. The project \ndesign  includes  lessons  from  ADB  and  other  development  partner  projects.10  Lessons  call  for \n(i) improving the sustainability and climate resilience of infrastructure; (ii) enhancing the capacity \nof  stakeholders;  (iii) supporting  an  enabling  policy  environment  for  agribusinesses;  and \n(iv) promoting  the  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \ninfrastructure. Lessons suggest to (i) include measures to accommodate implementation capacity \nbarriers; (ii) screen subprojects carefully to identify viable ones; (iii) limit the geographic coverage \nto obtain a balance between investments and overhead costs; and (iv) prepare subprojects that \ncan be implemented at government levels with the experience and capacity for such work. \n\n11. \nStrategic fit. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s ADS to 2025 (footnote1), the \n8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020) (footnote 7), the GMS \nRegional Investment Framework to 2022, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for \nthe Lao PDR; and is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.11 The project \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015-2020 which \naims to increase value addition and partnerships with the private sector in agro-processing.12  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: agricultural competitiveness improved.13 \n12. \nThe project will have the following outcome: productive and resource-efficient agribusiness value \nchains developed in project areas.14  \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2009.

Key  activities \n\n13. \nOutput  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure  improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient.  This  involves  rehabilitation  and  modernization  of  critical  public  and  private \ninfrastructure  to  increase  production  and  resource  efficiency,  reduce  postharvest  losses,  and \nenhance  value  chain \ninclude \n(i) rehabilitating  small-scale  irrigation  infrastructure  (tertiary  canals  and  water  retention  ponds) \nand rural roads; (ii) enhancing crop research, and safety- and quality-testing infrastructure; and \n(iii)  improving  climate-friendly  value  chain  infrastructure  for  agribusiness  enterprises.  Under \nactivity  (ii),  the  project  will  upgrade  the  facilities  and  services  offered  to  farmers  by  rice  and \nvegetable research centers in target provinces. It will also improve the infrastructure for quality \nand safety testing in the plant-protection laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, soil-testing \nlaboratory  of  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Land  Management,  and  provincial  agricultural \ncolleges. The project will establish an asset management system for rural infrastructure to ensure \nsustainability  and  implement  a  holistic  approach  to  O&M  by  focusing  on  institutions,  capacity \nbuilding, financing, and technologies. \n\n14. \nUnder  activity  (iii),  the  project  will  support  the  upgrade  of  small  and  medium-sized \nagribusinesses (rice mills, vegetable pack houses, and biofertilizer factories) through a matching \ngrant  scheme.15  The  grant-receiving  agribusinesses  will  need  to  adopt  climate-friendly \ntechnologies and good manufacturing practices, support smallholder farmers in employing CSA \nand  good  agricultural  practices  and  promote  effective  integration  of  smallholders  in  the  value \nchain. Upgrades to rice mills will improve rice recovery rates and allow the separation of white \nand  glutinous  rice  to  improve  access  to  premium  domestic  and  export  markets.  Support  for \nvegetable collection and marketing clusters will help reduce postharvest losses and improve the \nquality  and  quantity  of  vegetables  for  domestic  and  export  markets.  Upgrades  to  biofertilizer \nfactories will boost organic fertilizer production and encourage organic agriculture.  \n\nOutput  2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Activities  include \n15. \n(i) deploying  climate-resilient  rice  and  vegetable  varieties;  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nagricultural  production  groups  (APGs)  and  agribusinesses  for  climate-smart  and  organic \nagriculture; and (iii) promoting farm mechanization through smallholder financing (footnote 16) to \nAPGs. The project will disseminate flood- and drought-tolerant varieties, and train APGs on CSA, \ngood  agricultural  practices,  crop  calendars,  preparation  of  business  plans,  and  marketing. \nAgribusinesses  will  be  trained  on good  manufacturing practices;  safety  standards;  postharvest \ncrop handling to improve quality and market access; value addition through branding, packaging, \nand  agro-processing;  and  joint  contract  harvesting  operations.  Support  to  APGs  for  farm \nmechanization  includes  the  acquisition  of  small  machinery  for  land  clearance  and  leveling, \nplanting, on-farm micro irrigation, water storage, and application of agricultural inputs. \n\nOutput  3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate-friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  The \n16. \nproject will support the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the Ministry of Industry and \nCommerce  in  creating  an  enabling  policy  environment  to  promote  private  sector  investments \nthrough  public-private  partnerships,  contract  farming,  and  formation  of  joint  APG\u2013agribusiness \nventures.  Key  activities  include  (i)  formulating  climate-friendly  agribusiness  policies  such  as \nsupport for land registration and development of national standards for good agricultural practices, \ngood  manufacturing  practices,  and  organic  certification;  and  (ii)  promoting  green  finance  and \nclimate-risk-sharing  mechanisms  by  raising  the  awareness  of  financial  institutions  on  how  to \n\n                                                \n15 Guidelines  for  Matching  Grant  Scheme  and  Smallholder  Financing  Scheme  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nintegrate  environmental  and  climate-risk  screening  criteria  into  credit  application  and  reporting \nprocedures. The output will also disseminate information on climate-risk-sharing mechanisms. \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $46.37  million  (Table  1).

The sector lending modality \nis appropriate for this project because the government has a sector development plan (footnote \n1) and has demonstrated adequate capacity to implement the plan. Overall sector policies are \nadequate but need improvement to enable the growth of agribusinesses. The modality enables \nthe  government  to  identify  and  finance  additional  subprojects,  while  continuing  to  execute \nnecessary policy reforms in the implementation of the sector development plan.17 \n\n19. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures for works, \nequipment,  consulting  services,  incremental  operating  costs  and  taxes  and  duties.  The \ngovernment will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $0.75 million for counterpart staff salaries and office \nspace.  The  beneficiaries  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $5.12  million  as  cash  contribution  to \nupgrade  infrastructure.  Climate  adaptation  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.53  million.  ADB  will  finance \n100% of the adaptation costs.18 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2003.

Technical  due  diligence  was  conducted  for  three  representative \nsubprojects: (i) upgrading the Vanida Rice Mill as a member of the Khammouane Development \nRice Millers cluster, (ii) improving a vegetable packhouse (collection point and marketing cluster), \nand  (iii)  upgrading  the  state-owned  Dongxiengdee  biofertilizer  factory.  All  representative \nsubprojects were evaluated against a set of eligibility criteria that are detailed in the PAM. The \nproject incorporates a participatory development approach, whereby beneficiaries will participate \nin  the  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects,  including  measures  to  improve  climate \nresilience, and take partial responsibility for infrastructure\u2019 O&M. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe project team conducted economic and financial analysis for the three representative \n22. \nsubprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the rice mill subproject is 17.8%. The \nvegetable  collection  and  cleaning  center  subproject  yields  an  EIRR  of  19.0%.  The  biofertilizer \nfactory  subproject  yields  an  EIRR  of  14.8%.  Sensitivity  analysis  considered  several  downside \nscenarios,  including  (i)  a  10%  increase  in  subproject  costs,  (ii)  a  10%  increase  in  subproject \noperating costs, and (iii) a reduction in the sales margin by 5%\u201310%. In general, the EIRRs for all \nsubprojects exceed 9% and are economically viable. \n\nSince  the  representative  subprojects  generate  revenue,  project  beneficiaries  will  be \n23. \nresponsible for routine and periodic O&M of the investments. The financial internal rates of return \nof  13.5%,  12.7%,  and  10.6%  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  confirm  the \nsubprojects\u2019 financial viability. In  addition, cash flow analyses indicate strong financial capacity \nfor  O&M  and  debt  servicing.  As  for  nonrevenue-generating  investments  such  as  irrigation \nschemes and rural roads, the government will assume the primary O&M responsibility, although \nfarmers will contribute to routine O&M. For these investments, the annual O&M requirement for \ncivil works and equipment is estimated to be $0.64 million at project completion. The amount will \nnot  create  an  excessive  fiscal  burden  on  the  government.  Site  selection,  especially  for  non-\nrevenue-generating subprojects, will be determined by beneficiaries\u2019 readiness and commitment \nto assume O&M responsibility. All subprojects will develop a viable and realistic O&M plan. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nProject implementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s standard operating procedures. All procurement financed by ADB  will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  overall \nprocurement  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate  because  MAF  has  considerable  experience  in \nprocuring civil works, goods, and services, under ADB projects. However, to ensure more efficient \ndelivery, procurement will be handled by the National Project Management Office and supported \nby  an  international  and  a  national  procurement  specialist.  Each  province  will  also  have  a \nprocurement specialist assigned to handle small-value procurement. The pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk for the project is substantial given the low capacity for accounting, budgeting, \nand financial reporting, and low quality of internal and external audit reports.19 With support from \nan international and a national financial management specialist, MAF will ensure that the National \n                                                \n19 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fProject  Management  Office  and  the  provincial  project  implementation  units  maintain  financial \nrecords of adequate quality. MAF will prepare consolidated project financial statements and have \nthem audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MAF. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nThe project is classified as general intervention. It will benefit at least 100,000 people from \n25. \n20,000  households,  increasing  their  income  by  at  least  30%  through  increased  crop  yields, \nreduced costs of inputs and post-harvest losses and enhanced rural employment opportunities.20 \nThe project will promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen agribusiness value chains, and \nassist  in  developing  supply  arrangements  between  poor  farmers,  APGs,  cooperatives, \nprocessors, distributors, and traders. Farmers and APGs will be encouraged to produce quality \nfarm  products  on  time,  and  with  continuity  of  supply.  Landless  and  poor  households  will  be \nincluded in agribusiness, farm mechanization, and O&M training. Identified poor households in \nsubproject areas will be targeted for jobs related to civil works. Landless and poor farmers will \nhave the opportunity to access off-farm and on-farm employment related to postharvest support \nservices such as farm mechanization, drying, milling, grading, and storage of produce. \n\nGender. Women farmers are key actors in the rice and vegetable value chains. Women \n26. \nrepresent 50% of the population engaged in the agriculture sector in the target provinces. Yet the \ngender analysis found that they have less capacity (low technical skills and low awareness on \nclimate change impacts), less access to agricultural extension and business training, and a lower \nlevel of financial literacy than their male counterparts in project areas. \n\n27. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project team prepared \na gender action plan, which includes gender actions and quantitative targets to promote women\u2019s \nvoice and active participation in all project activities.21 The project will promote gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment by enhancing women\u2019s capacity for CSA production and processing, \nmanagement,  agricultural  machinery  use  and  maintenance,  and  by  strengthening  the  links \nbetween enterprises led by women and the agribusiness industry. Other actions include a detailed \ngender analysis of the rice and vegetable value chains to inform the development of a gender-\nresponsive agribusiness policy. Women will be targeted for training in infrastructure-related O&M, \nand as decision-makers in the selection of climate-resilient varieties of rice and vegetables. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \ncategories are as follows.22 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  three  representative  subprojects  were  found  to  have \n29. \nminimal  environmental  impacts  and  were  classified  as  category  C.  However,  category  B  is \nretained for the overall project as future subprojects, such as upgrade of access roads and tertiary \ncanals, may have environmental impacts. Public consultations informed the project design and \nthis  process  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  MAF  prepared  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework to guide the screening and classification of each subproject \nduring  implementation  and  disclosed  it  on  the  ADB  website  in  March  2018.23  Subprojects \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB.

Category  B  subprojects  will  require  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan.  Category  C \nsubprojects  will  need  summaries  of  environmental  implications  in  the  feasibilities  studies.  The \nenvironmental assessment and review framework includes an environmental code of conduct for \ncontractors,  which  will  be  adopted  for  all  category  C  subprojects  to  ensure  adoption  of  good \nenvironmental site management practices. A project grievance redress mechanism will facilitate \nthe resolution of any safeguard-related complaints. \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Subproject screening will identify and reject any \n30. \ncategory A subprojects that involve significant involuntary resettlement, economic displacement, \nor land acquisition. Due diligence conducted for the three representative subprojects shows that \nnone will result in any physical or economic displacement. Two subprojects will not require land \nacquisition while the vegetable packhouse subproject will need minimal land acquisition through \nvoluntary donation. However, as most of the subprojects will be prepared after Board approval, \nMAF prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework to guide the screening and selection \nof subprojects as well as the resettlement planning process, and uploaded to the ADB website in \nMarch  2018.24  During  project  preparation,  some  irrigation  and  farm  road  subprojects  were \nidentified that would require the acquisition of small strips of land to accommodate improvements \nto the distribution canals or the widening of farm road alignments. These small strips of land may \nbe  acquired  through  (i) voluntary  donation,  (ii)  negotiated  settlement,  or  (iii)  involuntary  land \nacquisition. A rigorous due diligence procedure to verify bona fide voluntary donation is included \nin the resettlement framework to further screen and select subprojects during implementation and \nguide the preparation of any resettlement plans, if required. If negotiated settlement (willing buyer \n\u2013 willing seller) is used, (i) MAF will involve an external third party to validate and document the \nprocess; and (ii) MAF will submit the report with supporting documents to ADB for concurrence \nbefore any civil works commence. If the land is acquired involuntarily, MAF will prepare the land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework and sent to ADB for concurrence and disclosure  before the bidding documents are \nissued. MAF will update due diligence reports for the sample subprojects based on the detailed \ndesign and prepare the safeguard planning documents for all non-sample subprojects for ADB \nreview before any contracts are awarded. \n\nIndigenous peoples (category B). Due diligence on the three representative subprojects \n31. \nshowed that many ethnic groups are living in the project provinces. The vegetable hub subproject, \nfor example, includes 50% of members of an ethnic group. However, no indigenous peoples were \nfound in the three representative subproject areas, and no indigenous peoples plan (IPP) was \nprepared. The MAF prepared an ethnic group development framework, which was disclosed on \nthe  ADB  website  in  March  2018,  to  guide  the  preparation  of  IPPs  as  needed  during  project \nimplementation, which will ensure inclusion and the full consultation and participation of ethnic \ngroup households and communities.25 Where indigenous peoples are impacted by a subproject, \ndepending on the extent and complexity, either a separate IPP will be prepared, or elements of \nan  IPP  will  be  included  in  the  subproject  feasibility  study  report.  Adequate  resources  were \nallocated \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  and  associated  capacity  development.  Building  on  experience  with \npast  ADB  projects,  the  government  committed  to  and  has  capacity  to  manage  social  and \nenvironmental risks, including various safeguard frameworks and plans. \n\nto  the  preparation, \n\n                                                \n24 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Group Development Framework (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk Description \nDeclining demand for rice and \nvegetables because of competition \nfrom external markets and stringent \nrequirements on quality from \nimporting countries \nWeak financial management \nregulatory systems and skills \n\nInadequate financing of O&M \nleading to premature deterioration of \ninfrastructure \nCatastrophic climate change events \ndamage infrastructure or interrupt \nimplementation \nHigh perceived corruption levels (the \ncountry is ranked 135th out of 180 \ncountries in the 2017 Transparency \nInternational Corruption Perception \nIndex) \nLimited staff capacity in target \nprovinces to meet all ADB and \nproject implementation requirements \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe project will raise the awareness of farmers, agriculture production \ngroups, and agribusinesses on export standards and ways to compete \nwith external markets and strengthen their quality-testing capacity in line \nwith the requirements of importing countries. \n\nNPMO and implementing staff will be trained on accounting, \ndisbursement, and auditing procedures. Any financial staff changes will be \nagreed with ADB. \nPreparation of a viable O&M plan will be a condition for selection of \nsubprojects, with preference for those with O&M funding. Robust designs \nand good quality control will reduce the O&M burden. \nThe project design incorporates climate-resilient construction and \nmaintenance measures. \n\nClose monitoring of project accounts with two reviews per year. \nMechanisms for reporting corruption are in place. The project will enhance \nstakeholder awareness of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date).
