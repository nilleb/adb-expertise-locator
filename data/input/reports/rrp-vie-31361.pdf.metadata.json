The\nlack of fund resources and the paucity of medium- and long-term\ncapital are major constraints to the growth of rural household and\nmicro and small-scale businesses. By promoting the establishment\nof value-added enterprises, rural households and businesses can\nraise the productivity of land and labor.\nThe earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Rural Credit\nProject (RCP)1 has shown that the demand for this type of credit is\nstrong, and the loan has improved the incomes of subborrowers\nand  created  employment  opportunities.  Although  the  formal\nfinancial system reaches 50 percent of rural households, it has\nbypassed about 6 million poorer households. As major lenders to\nthe poor, VBARD and PCFs have developed the infrastructure to\nreach poor households and are the most appropriate and cost-\nefficient  institutions  to  extend  financial  services  to  those  not\ncovered so far, as well as to check the growing disparity in rural-\nurban incomes.\nThe ADB loan will also help VBARD and PCFs overcome the current\nmismatch  in  their  sources  and  the  duration  of  their  funds,  and\nthrough  the  loan's  selective  and  leveraged  financing,  assist  in\nachieving  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  and  increasing  the\neffectiveness of its assistance.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project  aims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce\npoverty and promote private sector investments in rural and agro-\n                                                \n1 Loan 1457-VIE:Rural Credit Project, for $50.0 million, approved on 12  September 1996.", "iii\nbased businesses through credit. The scope comprises (i) a credit\nline  to  VBARD  to  finance  about  14,900  micro  and  small  rural\nenterprises  (MSEs) and 18,500 income-generating activities of low-\nincome households; (ii) a credit line to CCF to finance 7,500 MSEs\nand 31,000 income-generating activities of low-income households;\nand  (iii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  VBARD  and  CCF-PCF  in\nproviding efficient and improved services to rural clients. The Project\nwill be implemented in the rural areas whose economic roles and\nfunctions are closely linked to agricultural and rural enterprises,\noutside the municipal boundaries of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh cities.\nAreas designated as the poorest in the country will receive special\nconsideration to narrow the gap in incomes and to attain sectoral\nand regional balance in growth.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $145.5 million equivalent\nof which $60.9 million equivalent is the foreign exchange cost and\n$84.6 million equivalent is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 60.91 19.09 80.00 55.0\nVietnam Bank for Agriculture     a - 28.61 28.61 19.7\nCentral People's Credit Fund-\n- 16.36 16.36 11.3\n      People's Credit Fund\nSubborrowers - 20.54 20.54 14.0\nTotal Cost 60.91 84.60 145.51 100\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of Special Drawing Rights 62,532,000 ($80 million equivalent)\nwill be made from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a\nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. An interest\ncharge of 1 percent will be levied on the loan during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent during the amortization period.  ADB will finance 55\npercent of the cost of each subproject, VBARD and PCF will finance\n31 percent, and the subborrowers will fund the balance (14 percent)\nfrom their own resources.\nRelending and Onlending The Government will relend the loan proceeds in dong to VBARD\nTerms and  CCF  at  the  weighted  average  cost  of  deposit  funds  of  the\nbanking system, determined by the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) at\nthe end of each quarter. VBARD  will onlend to eligible subborrowers\nat  a  market  interest  rate  based  on  a  margin  not  exceeding  3.6\npercent for short-term loans and 6.0 percent for medium- and long-\nterm loans above the average prime rate of nine commercial banks\ndetermined by SBV on a monthly basis. It is envisaged that this\nmarket rate will cover operating costs, loan losses, interest variation\nrisks, and a reasonable profit for VBARD. CCF-PCF will onlend at a\nrate currently set at 14 percent by SBV; that will cover operating\ncosts, loan losses, interest variation risks, and a reasonable profit.", "iv\nFor VBARD, up to 65 percent of the credit line may be subloans to\nsmall enterprises (less than 50 employees). The subloans will not\nexceed $30,000 equivalent, and on average will be about $7,500. At\nleast  15  percent  of  subloans  by  value  will  be  made  to  micro\nenterprises (less than 5 employees) and 20 percent to low-income\nhouseholds with a per capita expenditure of $128 per annum. For\nPCF, subloans will not exceed $10,000 equivalent, and will average\nabout  $750  made  to  micro  businesses.  At  least  50  percent  of\nsubloans by value will be made to low-income households with a per\ncapita expenditure of $128 per annum. The repayment and grace\nperiods will be based on the cash flow of the subprojects and the\nrepayment capacity of the subborrowers.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 November 2006\nImplementation Suitably equipped and staffed project implementation units (PIUs)\nArrangements will be established in VBARD and the CCF. The PIU will be the\nproject-specific contact and focal point on all matters relating to\nimplementation, management, and coordination of the Project. The\nfollowing organizational units of VBARD and CCF will participate\ndirectly in project activities: (i) the Credit Department in the head\noffice; (ii) the concerned provincial and district branches or PCFs;\n(iii) the Training Division at head office; and (iv) the Planning and\nBudget  Division,  which  will  coordinate  with  all  divisions  and\ndepartments concerned on project implementation.\nTo ensure effective coordination and supervision, the SBV will act\nas  a  project  coordination  agency  responsible  for  implementing\npolicy aspects of the Project, overseeing the implementation of the\nreform  action  plans  of  VBARD  and  CCF-PCF,  and  ensuring\ncompliance by VBARD and CCF-PCF with all covenants in the loan\nand project agreements. In addition, the Government will form a\nproject steering committee headed by a deputy governor of SBV,\nwhich will meet at least twice yearly to provide overall guidance and\ndirections  for  project  implementation,  and  help  to  resolve  any\noutstanding issues.\nExecuting Agencies Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, and Central\nPeople's Credit Fund\nProcurement International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for major civil\nworks  contracts  exceeding  $1  million  and  supply  contracts  for\nequipment and materials exceeding $500,000. Civil works contracts\ncosting less than $500,000, which are small and for which foreign\ncontractors are not interested to bid, and where local facilities are\navailable  at  reasonable  cost  and  can  be  relied  upon  to  perform\nefficiently, will use local competitive bidding procedures acceptable\nto ADB. Procurement under subloans by subborrowers will be in\naccordance with ADB guidelines for loans to development finance\ninstitutions.", "v\nConsulting Services All consulting services will be engaged by the Executing Agencies in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic\nconsultants.  For  the  institutional  strengthening  component,\nconsulting services will comprise 35 person-months: 5 international\nand 30 domestic.\nEstimated Project 31 May 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject benefits and The Project will result in increased income for about 72,000 farmers,\nBeneficiaries farm households, and rural businesses. Of this, 49,500 low-income\nhouseholds  (below  the  poverty  line)  or  70  percent  of  project\nbeneficiaries will benefit from financial assistance, and 600 micro\nand small businesses will be assisted with support services from\nrural business centers. About 101,700 full-time jobs will be created.\nBy creating remunerative employment in the rural areas; assisting in\nestablishing  new  enterprises;  and  expanding,  modernizing,  and\nbalancing existing enterprises, the Project will improve the dispersal\nof economic activities to the rural areas, thereby helping to narrow\nthe income gap between rural and urban households. The Project\nwill  contribute  to  strengthening  the  rural  skills  base,  as  well  as\nlinkages  with  the  urban  economy  by  supporting  the  creation  of\nsustainable  rural  business  centers  (RBCs),  which  will  provide\nbusiness advisory and training services, among others, in rural areas\non a commercial basis.\nRisks and Safeguards Although the Government has further liberalized interest rate by\nintroducing  a  base  lending  rate  on  a  monthly  basis,  being  the\naverage  rate  for  the  prime  customers  of  the  main  commercial\nbanks operating in the country, VBARD and CCF are not permitted\nto charge interest on their subloans beyond the margin prescribed\nby the Government, currently 0.5 percent per month for medium-\nand long-term loans. Under the circumstances, there is a risk that\nVBARD and CCF-PCF may not earn enough to cover the cost of\ntheir  rural  lending.  Also,  commercial  credit  risks  resulting  from\nadverse  weather  conditions,  poor  markets,  poor  infrastructure,\ninsufficient collateral, etc., are associated with all subloans. These\nrisks are expected to be mitigated with, among others, an annual\nreview of the adequacy of spreads for delivering financial services\n(and appropriate changes made on them), training of credit staff,\nintroduction  of  an  incentive  system  based  on  subloan  recovery\nperformance, improved monitoring systems, and establishment of\nRBCs to assist and advise subborrowers.\nTechnical Assistance To help Viet Nam create sustainable support services for nonfarm\nand  rural  businesses,  the  Government  requested  a  technical\nassistance (TA) to (i) establish three pilot RBCs, which will provide\ncredit facilitation, business advisory and training services, among", "vi\nothers, to rural businesses and poor households; (ii) provide start-\nup support to RBCs; (iii) develop lending and credit management\nprocedures  in  PCFs;  and  (iv)  develop  improved  monitoring  and\nevaluation in PCFs and VBARD. A team of consultants comprising\n12 person-months of international and 18 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services is required. The consultants under the TA will\nbe engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  with\nrespect to the use of domestic consultants. The total cost of the TA\nis $1,440,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $1,000,000 on\na grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.", "vii", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Rural Enterprise Finance Project. The Report also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Support  for  Rural  Businesses,  and  if  the\nproposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the\nBoard, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. At the request of the Government, a Loan Appraisal Mission1 from the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) visited Viet Nam from 16 to 28 August 2000 to process the Rural Enterprise Finance\nProject. The Mission met staff of various Government departments, State Bank of Viet Nam\n(SBV), Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the Central People\u2019s\nCredit Fund-People\u2019s Credit Fund (CCF-PCF), and beneficiaries under the Rural Credit Project2 to\ndiscuss  the  formulation  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project.  The  Project  first\nappeared  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Assistance  Program  (CAP)  in  December  1997.  A  Mission3  to\nprepare a project in 1998 identified some financial and institutional weaknesses in VBARD and\nagreed with the VBARD to address these weaknesses through an advisory technical assistance\n(ADTA)4  before  another  loan  was  provided.  The  TA  commenced  in  January  2000  and  is\nexpected  to  be  completed  early  in  2001.  The  TA  progress  to  date  is  such  that  ADB  is\nproceeding with processing the proposed Project. An ADB Country Programming Mission in\nMarch 2000 confirmed that the Project will be processed for approval by ADB in 2000. The\nproject framework is in Appendix 1.\n3. The operations of ADB in Viet Nam have focused on supporting the country\u2019s transition to\na market-based economy. Central to the operations is assistance with policy reforms in the\nagriculture and financial sectors, expanding rural enterprise and nonfarm businesses through the\ndevelopment of rural financial institutions, and priority programs for poverty reduction in the rural\nsector.  In September 1996, ADB approved a loan of SDR34.1 million to the Government for the\nRural  Credit  Project  (RCP)  to  finance  short-  and  medium-term  loans  for  agriculture  and\nagribusinesses and to strengthen rural financial institutions. Because of the very strong demand\nfor such credit, the loan amount was nearly fully disbursed by June 2000. In view of the positive\nimpact on rural incomes and employment, and the performance of the participating financial\ninstitutions the Government requested ADB for a follow-on project to further strengthen the\ncapacity of VBARD and the CCF-PCF network.\nIII. BACKGROUND\n4. The Government of Viet Nam's economic development strategy since 1986 has been doi\nmoi: a reform process to transform the economy from central planning to free market. In\n1992/93, 51 percent of the population were classified as poor based on a poverty line equivalent\nto 13 kilograms (kg) of rice per capita per month.5 Viet Nam currently has a per capita income of\nabout $350 per annum. Recent research shows that 20 percent of the population remained very\n                                                \n1  Comprising A. M. de Alwis, Mission Leader; A. Pio, Sr. Programs Officer; J.

According to the Viet Nam\nLiving Standards Survey (1993), 90 percent of the poor are found among three quarters of the\npopulation living in rural areas, indicating disproportionate rural impoverishment. With the vastly\ndifferent growth rates from 2.5 percent in the North and central region to 15 percent in the South,\nthis income disparity between rural and urban sector workers is set to widen. Between 1993 and\n1998, the ratio of the expenditure of the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent rose from 4.9 to\n5.5.\n5. The impact of the recent strong economic growth on rural employment generation and\non farmers income has been limited. While the transition to a market economy is improving the\nlivelihoods of many, it is also creating a large pool of poor families that lack resources and are\nvulnerable to economic shocks, which were previously mitigated by the cooperative system\nsafety net. Among them are women and minority groups who bear particularly heavy adjustment\ncosts (as Viet Nam moves away from the centralized system) and whose lives are so precarious\nthat it only takes an unforeseen crisis such as ill health to set in motion a downward spiral in\ntheir standard of living. Their vulnerability is compounded by their lack of access to financial\nresources and their inability to borrow sufficient amounts from formal sources because of supply\nand collateral constraints.\n6. The Government recognizes the importance of small and medium-scale enterprises and\ntheir  significance  in  the  market  economies  of  other  countries  in  the  region.7  Overall,  it  is\nestimated that about 10 million workers are unemployed. In urban areas, the unemployment\nrate varies between 4.6 and 7.3 percent. 8 Underemployment is estimated to be 26 percent in\nrural areas and 17 percent in urban areas. There are about 1 million new entrants to the labor\nforce each year. It is recognized that the agriculture sector is unlikely to generate significant\nincreases in employment opportunities and the focus is now on the creation of employment in\nrural industry and services as the main means of economic growth and reducing poverty.\n7. However, despite the recognition of the need for an environment in which private rural\nenterprise can flourish, Government policies have to some extent hindered its creation, and\nreform is necessary. Recent changes in the enterprise law have reduced the bureaucracy\ninvolved in business establishment, but high marginal tax rates on income and enterprise profits\ndiscourage entrepreneurship, inhibit employment creation, and encourage tax evasion. Tax\nincentives for small businesses merit more consideration because it is small businesses that will\nprimarily address the severe rural underemployment problem.\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Financial Sector\n8. The Vietnamese financial system comprises the formal, semiformal, and informal sector.\nThe formal financial sector comprises three groups of financial institutions operating under the\n                                                \n6  Dapice, D. et al. 1999.

Rural Industrial Development in Viet Nam.", "3\nprudential supervision of SBV: banks, finance companies, and cooperatives. The institutional\nstructure, as of 30 June 2000, consisted of (i) State Bank of Viet Nam (Central Bank); (ii) State-\nowned  commercial  banks  (Bank  for  Foreign  Trade  of  Viet  Nam,  Bank  of  Investment  and\nDevelopment of Viet Nam, Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam, VBARD, and Viet Nam\nBank for the Poor [VBP]; (iii) 68 foreign banks of which 29 have branches; (iv) two finance\ncompanies; (v) four joint-venture banks; (vi) 16 insurance companies, (vii) 50 joint-stock banks\n(31 urban and 19 rural); (viii) 960 PCFs (and an apex CCF); and (ix) 69 credit cooperatives.\n9. The Government is pursuing a banking reform program comprising (i) restructuring joint-\nstock  banks  and  State-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs);  (ii)  improving  the  regulatory,\nsupervisory, and legal framework; and (iii) developing human resources in the banking sector.  In\nthe near term the agenda of the reform program includes (i) restructuring plans for SOCBs; (ii)\nissuance of a decree to limit policy-induced lending; (iii) establishing an asset management\ncompany; (iv) rehabilitating joint sector banks; (v) moving toward a risk-based supervision system;\nand (vi) deregulating the administrative interest rate structure. The International Monetary Fund's\n(IMF) Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fund (ESAF) and Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility\n(PRGF),  World  Bank\u2019s  Structural  Adjustment  Credit,  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan\n(FSPL)  and  Corporate  Governance  TA,  and  bilateral  sources  are  supporting  these  reform\nmeasures.\n10. Progress has been made in (i) restructuring joint-stock banks and SOCBs; (ii) improving\nregulatory, supervisory, and legal framework for banks; (iii) issuance of insurance and collateral\ndecrees  and  implementing  regulations;  and  (iv)  human  resources  development.  Prudential\nregulations for minimum capital, loan loss provisions, and financial ratios have been issued, and\ndecrees for deposit insurance, collateral regulations, organization and operations of policy banks\nand commercial banks have been drafted. In addition, assessing training needs for the banking\nsector has been initiated. The immediate emphasis is to (i) finalize operational restructuring plans\nfor all SOCBs; (ii) issue decrees on policy-lending banks and on new policy banks; (iii) issue\nguidelines  for  a  transparent  mechanism  for  restructuring  troubled  banks;  (iv)  continue\nrehabilitating, merging, and closing troubled joint-stock banks; and (v) issue decrees already\ndrafted.\n2. Rural Financial Sector\n11. Two rural SOCBs (VBARD and VBP), 19 rural shareholding banks, 960 PCFs, and 69\ncredit cooperatives service the agriculture and rural sector, reaching 6 million people or about\n50 percent of rural farm households. Among them, VBARD, the premier agricultural and rural\ndevelopment bank, has a market share of 3.7 million rural households. VBARD has also the\nlargest lending volume, with 75 percent of the total lending to the sector in 1999 or D32,000\nbillion (about $2.286 billion), PCFs provide about 5 percent and nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs),  a  negligible  share.  VBARD  lends  to  farm  households,  cooperatives,  and  private\ncommercial and State-owned enterprises (SOEs). Loans to SOEs constitute about 30 percent of\nVBARD\u2019s  total  loans  outstanding.  It  is  estimated  that  15-20  percent  of  these  loans  are\ndelinquent. Loans to private enterprises constitute a very small portion of VBARD\u2019s portfolio,\nabout 3 percent or about $70 million, while the remaining 67 percent are loans to households.\n12. The reform in agriculture, particularly the formation of private farms, has created a\ndemand for loans by the 12 million rural households including about 10 million decollectivized\nfarms. Concurrent reorientation of the financial system from a monobank system to a two-tier\nbanking structure, as well as entry of private financial institutions, has made financial services\nmore  accessible  to  about  6  million  rural  households.  Nonetheless,  a  significant  share  of", "4\npotential demand is not served.  The Viet Nam Living Standards Survey  (1993) reports that 73\npercent of all household loans were obtained from informal sources: moneylenders, friends, and\nrelatives.\na. VBARD\n13. VBARD provides about three fourths of the rural credit in the country in absolute terms\nand its services extend to one third of the country\u2019s estimated 12 million rural households or 70\npercent of the rural households served by the formal financial institutions (Appendix 2). VBARD\nhas a nationwide network of 1,282 branches, mostly in districts and subdistricts, managed by\n23,110 staff, of whom 313 are in the head office and 30 percent or 7,000 are specialized credit\nstaff. Since its creation in 1988, VBARD has shown remarkable growth and transformation,\nchanging (i) from an institution created to serve the SOEs, to one that predominantly meets the\nfinancial services needs of farm households and the emerging private sector enterprises; (ii)\nfrom being a conduit for channeling budgetary resources, to a dynamic financial intermediary\nand one of the largest depositary institutions in the country; and (iii) from being a direct (retail)\nlending institution to one that increasingly adopts indirect means of credit delivery such as\nthrough joint liability groups. These changes have to some extent addressed the issues of\naccess to credit at a reasonable cost, availability of deposit facilities and reduction in transaction\ncosts associated with retail rural lending. This reorientation has occurred against the backdrop\nof formation of private farms and small-scale rural enterprises as part of the transition to a\nmarket economy. It indicates the significant role that VBARD has played in development of the\nrural and agriculture sector.\n14. The loan portfolio of VBARD at end-1999 was D29,583 billion ($2.113 million) with an\naverage loan size of about $300.  This loan portfolio grew by 22 percent during 1999.  The loan\nportfolio to households at D19,357 billion ($1,382 million) and to non-SOE enterprises at D1,568\nbillion ($112 million) accounted for 71 percent of the total loan portfolio. Loan to SOEs operating\nin agriculture at end-1999 was D8,658 billion ($618 million) or 29 percent of the portfolio. By\nloan term, 39 percent of the total loan portfolio were medium- and long-term, and the rest short-\nterm. By economic activity, agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture accounted for 61 percent;\nindustry,  7  percent;  trading  and  services,  7  percent;  and  food  processing  and  others,  the\nremaining 25 percent.\n15. International  auditors  have  audited  VBARD\u2019s  financial  statements  since  1993.  After\nrecording marginal profits in 1993,1994, and 1995, VBARD incurred a marginal loss of D12.7\nbillion in 1996. In 1997 and 1998, in compliance with stricter loan provisioning, VBARD took an\nadditional charge of D625 billion ($44.64 million) to cover potential loan losses relating to\nprevious years, leading to a net loss9 of D696.6 billion ($49.8 million) in 1997 and D498.9 billion\n($35.6 million) in 1998. The resulting negative net worth of D350 billion necessitated an urgent\ninfusion of D1,493 billion into the legal capital of VBARD in 1998, which brought the capital\nadequacy requirement (CAR) to 4.6 percent. Further infusion is necessary to build the CAR to a\nminimum of 8 percent in 1998. Based on the provisional accounts of 1999, VBARD is expected\nto make a net profit of D131 billion ($9.4 million). Taking this into account, and the projected\nperformance for 2000, further capital contribution of D1,563 billion is required to bring the CAR\nto 8 percent in 2000.\n                                                \n9  The reported losses for the year do not include any accrued interest income, but includes a partial accrual for\nfunding costs.  A full accrual accounting policy for both assets and funding may well have reduced reported\nlosses.", "5\n16. Overdue loans (excluding frozen loans) at end-1998 amounted to D1.1 billion or 4.5\npercent of total loans. Cumulative provisions at end-1998 were D1.6 billion or 6.4 percent of\noutstanding loans. However, if frozen loans are included (1998, D1.02 billion), the overdue rates\nfor 1998 would be 8.7 percent. The net income realized on average loan portfolio was D131\nbillion or 0.5 percent in 1999. VBARD managed to stay profitable due to its earnings from\nnoninterest income. It was able to break even on its loan operations for the year. VBARD would\nneed a spread of 6 percent to break even on its loan operations. The spread based on the new\nscheme for interest rate determination (as approved in August 2000) would be about 6 percent.\n17. VBARD has a basic planning structure. It prepares quarterly, annual and 5-year rolling\nplans that are primarily budgetary in nature. It has, for example, operational and institutional\ndevelopment plans for training, information technology (IT), accounting, and computerization.\nHowever, these plans are piecemeal, and VBARD has no overall corporate plan that sets out its\nmission  statement,  corporate  objectives,  code  of  corporate  conduct,  strategies,  business\ndevelopment and financial plans to serve as a basis for detailed operational planning. The lack\nof  a  fully  integrated  planning  framework  reduces  VBARD\u2019s  ability  to  focus  on  its  main\norganizational objectives, restricts the autonomy of management, and makes it difficult for\nVBARD  to  justify  and  raise  the  resources  it  needs  to  enhance  its  performance.  Such  an\nintegrated planning system is urgently needed to provide shareholders and management with a\nvision  of  the  bank\u2019s  future  and  a  framework  for  measuring  management  and  institutional\nperformance. ADB\u2019s assistance under a TA is currently helping VBARD to strengthen corporate\ngovernance.\n18. VBARD\u2019s management has recognized that substantive changes need to be made in the\ninstitution to serve its clients better, to ensure its sustainability and to develop the capabilities of\nits staff to function in a competitive environment. The key areas to be addressed are the\ndevelopment of new products and services, risk management, accounting and management\ninformation  systems  (MIS),  IT  systems  development,  and  personnel  systems  and  training.\nOrganizational change in these areas will be reflected in the overall corporate plan being\nprepared under the TA. The TA will be completed prior to project implementation and will\ninclude detailed recommendations for reform. Given that the Project will provide substantial\nsupport for implementing reforms through the institutional support component, it is appropriate\nto link credit line disbursements to an agreed-upon plan of reform implementation (Appendix 3).\nb. CCF-PCF\n19. The CCF is the apex institution of the PCF network. It was established in August 1995 and\nis an autonomous legal entity. PCFs are small-scale financial institutions operating in communes\nand, like the CCF and Regional People's Credit Funds (RCFs), are autonomous legal entities. The\nPCF network was established in March 1993 by a Decision of the Prime Minister (No. 390/TTG)\nwith the objective of creating a strong rural financial system based on the concept of self-\nmanaged, community-based banking, and had been operating on a pilot basis for six years up to\n1999. The CCF-PCF network is a brainchild of SBV, which continues to play a critical role in its\ndevelopment  and  devolution  into  an  autonomous  organization.  The  Credit  Cooperative\nDepartment (CCD) and the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) of the SBV closely oversee\nthe development of the network and continue to monitor it under Directive 329/CV-TTR1 on\nRemote Monitoring, which is a reporting mechanism for the whole network. Because of the close\nmonitoring, individual PCFs have a good understanding of their latest financial and operational\nsituation (Appendix 4).", "6\n20. CCF, RCFs, and the PCFs operate under the Law on Banking, Cooperatives, and Finance\nCompanies of 1990. The concepts and principles governing their credit and savings operations\nare in line with ADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy. The Government understands the\nimportance of a conducive policy environment for PCF development, and to this end has made\nprogress  in  adopting  a  market-oriented  system  by  progressively  deregulating  interest  rate,\nminimizing State intervention to address perceived market failures such as the delivery of financial\nservices to the rural areas, creating an enabling legal framework, developing close central bank\nsupervision and inspection, and adopting appropriate accounting and auditing systems.\n21. Being autonomous business entities in about 1,000 or 10 percent of the total communes in\nthe country, the PCFs are compelled to make their own business decisions and are accountable\nfor  the  results.  In  a  six-year  pilot  program  (national  evaluation  of  the  PCF  network  by  the\nGovernment in December 1999) PCFs performed creditably, were conservative in their lending\noperations,  and  generally  made  sound  lending  decisions.  The  results  also  show  that  the\nGovernment has not intervened to save the PCFs that have failed to operate profitably. Indeed, 17\nof 988 PCFs have been closed by the SBV for failing to meet the standards set for them, even\nthough the Government had placed a heavy burden on them by taxing them at the rate of 45\npercent. The 971 PCFs that passed showed an average profit of D51 million and recovery\nperformance of more than 95 percent.\n22. From an initial 49 PCFs in 49 provinces in October 1994, the network expanded rapidly to\n988 PCFs, 21 RCFs operating in the poorest 53 of 61 provinces of the country, and a CCF in\nHanoi by 31 December 1999. Outreach also grew significantly from 46,000 members in 1994 to\n700,000 members and 746,000 borrowers in December 1999. Their combined total asset at 31\nDecember 1999 was D2,300 billion, having grown 30 times from D83 billion in 1994.  The\ncombined equity capital at 31 December 1999 was about D300 billion or $21 million, of which\ndomestically mobilized savings accounted for  D1,532 billion and the rest (D440 billion) came from\nexternal assistance. Total disbursements since inception exceeded $1.0 billion or D14,000 billion.\nBy the end of 1999, the PCF network accounted for 5 percent of the market for rural credit and\nwas a potential competitive source of financial services to the poor and rural households.\n23. Despite the PCF network's significant growth and successful operations, there is still\nsubstantial potential for improving its services and meeting the demand of the people for credit\nand savings, estimated at more than five times the level provided at present. Based on the recent\nevaluation, supplemented by field studies, the network has developed a cautious operational plan\nfor the next four years.  Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) intends to provide\nfurther  assistance  to  strengthen  the  network,  while  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische\nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  has  approved  and  is  implementing    (1999-2001)  a  major  TA  for\nrestructuring the network, specifically structural integration of the PCF network, training, and\nimprovement  in  operational  efficiencies.  By  December  2003,  the  network  aims  to  establish\nanother 360 PCFs, increase membership by 723,000 or by 100 percent, increase equity of\nmembers by D170 billion (about $12 million), increase mobilized funds by D1,350 billion (about\n$95 million) or 90 percent, and increase other borrowings by D500 billion (about $40 million). The\nnetwork aims to double the number of loans, make larger and longer term loans, and increase the\noutstanding loans by D2,580 billion or more than 2.3 times the current amount by 2003.\n3. Rural and Agrobased Enterprises\n24. The gross domestic product (GDP) share of agriculture in 1999 was about 24 percent,\nbut the rural and agriculture sectors accounted for three fourths of employment. Farm families\nare  increasingly  turning  to  nonfarm  and  off-farm  activities  as  a  source  of  income  and", "7\nemployment, but they face several constraints such as availability of credit and savings facilities,\nlack of market information, insufficient collateral, outmoded equipment and technology, and high\ntaxes. Hitherto, VBARD had concentrated on increasing financial services to \u201cfarm families,\u201d\nwhich became the basic unit of production in the Vietnamese agricultural economy under Decree\n10 in April 1988, while reducing its lending to SOEs.\n25. The private sector has grown rapidly from a negligible base since the promulgation in\n1991 of the Law on Private Enterprises and the Law on Companies. In 1999 there were 386\njoint-stock  companies,  11,742  limited  liability  companies,  and  26,338  registered  household\nbusinesses. The cooperative sector collapsed in the early 1990s, falling from nearly 43,000 in\n1989 to only 1,876 in 1995. There has been some revival and in 1998 there were 4,259\nnonagricultural  cooperatives.  The  most  recent  estimate  of  the  number  of  unregistered\nhousehold businesses was 2.22 million in 1996.10 The number of SOEs fell from about 12,000 in\n1990 to about 6,800 in 1999.  In terms of the capital criteria for the official definition of small and\nmedium-scale enterprises (SMEs), about 89.5 percent of the registered enterprises in Viet Nam\nwere classified as small. Some 96 percent had less than 200 employees11 (Appendix 5).\n26. Despite  this  growth,  rural  industrial  development  has  been  affected  by  policies\nemanating from different ministries, which have been biased against it. In 1999, the Government\npassed the new Enterprise Law aimed at improving the legal framework for businesses and\naddressing the contradictions in earlier laws and decrees. This is an important milestone in\nimproving the environment for the operation of micro, small, and medium-size businesses.\nHowever, there are still several constraints, the principal among which are the inability of\nbusinesses to effectively use land use rights and assets purchased with loan proceeds as\ncollateral, high marginal tax rates on enterprise profits that discourage business expansion, and\na prohibition on the formation of wholly private business associations. These constraints are the\nsubject of active dialogue between the Government and external agencies. The Government\nrecognizes the need to resolve the policy issues concerned.\n27. The Government also recognizes that fostering the development of micro and small\nenterprises will build the foundation for significant economic growth in the future, while at the\nsame time creating employment opportunity, reducing poverty, expanding the tax base, and\nstimulating  consumption.  Credit  alone  will  not  achieve  this,  and  institutional  support  for\ndevelopment  of  microbusiness  and  small-size  industries  in  the  districts  and  communes\ncontinues to be weak, with line ministries and research and technical institutes having little\noutreach in rural areas. Rural entrepreneurs have nowhere to turn to for business assistance or\nadvice or to lobby with Government on issues affecting their livelihood. They could benefit from\n                                                \n10  Source:  Master\u2019s Program in Development Economics, Development Economics Group. 2000. An Overview of\nSMEs in Vietnam.\n11  There is no official definition of small and micro enterprises in Viet Nam. Under decision No. 681/CP-KTN of\n20 June 1998, a small and medium-scale enterprise (SME) is defined as an incorporated enterprise with less than\nD5 billion in capital and employing less than 200 persons. For the purposes of the Project, micro enterprises have\nless than five employees and small enterprises have less than 50 employees. Nonfarm businesses means\nbusinesses that are not concerned with primary agricultural, livestock, and forestry production. Non-SOEs\ncomprise joint stock companies, limited-liability companies, and sole proprietorships incorporated under the\nCompanies Law and the Law on Private Enterprises and approved by the relevant Provincial People\u2019s Committee\nor higher level authority. A cooperative is an enterprise incorporated under the Law on Cooperatives. Household\nenterprises comprise households carrying on predominantly nonfarm business under a business license granted\nby the District People\u2019s Committee in accordance with Decree 66-HDBT of 1992. Other households carry on\nnonfarm businesses that are not registered as part of their overall farm and nonfarm activities. Rural areas are\ndefined as areas outside the municipal boundaries of major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Collectively, the\nbusinesses to be supported under the Project are referred to as \u201crural enterprises.\u201d", "8\nservices that provide business advice, information, training, linkages, and networking; promote\nmicro  and  small  enterprise  and  businesses  generally;  and  lobby  for  a  better  operating\nenvironment.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n28. Concerned over the widening rural-urban inequalities, the Government has accorded\nprimacy to rural development in its poverty reduction efforts, particularly in creating employment\nopportunities in rural areas. Government efforts have also focused on improving infrastructure in\npoor communes and the living standards of ethnic minorities, sometimes through potentially\ncontroversial resettlement programs. In preparing for the 2001-2005 Plan, 2010 strategy, and\n2020 vision, the Government is now reassessing its Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction\n(HEPR) and other social expenditure programs that provide targeted assistance to households.\nADB has offered to assist in this effort, and in strengthening social safety nets, such as health\ninsurance for the poor.\n29. The Government\u2019s goals for poverty reduction are to lift the remaining very poor above\nthe current national poverty line by 2000 and then, over a 15-year period, to raise the remaining\npoor above higher poverty lines.12 The Government aims to develop rural financial services to\nreduce rural poverty and increase employment  by increasing output and productivity with the\nadoption of new technology and development of value-added market surpluses in agricultural\nand other rural businesses. In particular, the Government is pursuing a policy to (i) enhance the\noutreach of lending institutions, (ii) augment resources for medium-term and long-term lending,\n(iii) apply reasonable interest rate policies to mobilize resources for lending, and (iv) gradually\nreduce preferential loans to SOEs.\n30. The objectives of the Government\u2019s rural credit policies are to (i) develop the rural and\nagriculture sector, (ii) increase output and productivity with the adoption of new technology, (iii)\npromote growth of the commodity-economy, (iv) reduce rural poverty, and (v) increase rural\nemployment.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n31. A number of multilateral and bilateral sources at many different levels have provided\nexternal assistance for developing the rural financial system, to address the overall financial\nsystem framework, the supply of credit, and institutional and capacity weaknesses of sector\ninstitutions. Support for reform of the overall financial and banking sector framework has been\nprovided by IMF through its 1994 ESAF, by the World Bank 1994 SAC, and by ADB in 1996\nthrough the first FSPL.13 Support for the rural financial system has been provided by bilateral and\nmultilateral sources including ADB, World Bank, Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD),\nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD),  and  Germany\u2019s  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr\nWiederaufbau (KfW) (Appendix 6). ADB provided two TAs to strengthen credit appraisal capacity\nand  improve  corporate  governance  at  VBARD,  while  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment and World Bank provided support for financial and portfolio audit of VBARD by\nexternal auditors. CIDA and GTZ have assisted in establishing and strengthening PCFs.\n                                                \n12  These are 15 kilograms (kg) of rice per capita per month in rural mountainous areas, 20 kg in other rural areas,\nand 25 kg in urban areas.\n13  Loan 1485-VIE[SF]: Financial Sector Program, for $90 million, approved on 19 November 1996.", "9\n32. Future operations under consideration in support of rural finance include a two-step line of\ncredit for SMEs by Japan Bank for International Cooperation; a follow-up loan for agricultural\ncredit of about EUR30 million by AFD in the second half of 2000; and a World Bank Second Rural\nFinance Project, currently scheduled for 2002. These operations would support the improved\npolicy framework promoted by the IMF\u2019s PRGF and World Bank\u2019s second SAC under discussion\nfor late 2000 or early 2001, and ADB\u2019s second FSPL slated for 2001.\nD. Lessons Learned\n33. The major lessons learned in implementing rural finance projects in ADB\u2019s developing\nmember countries14 that are relevant to Viet Nam are as follows:\n(i)  Assessing and strengthening the executing agency's (EA's) institutional capacity at\nappraisal in subproject evaluation and project supervision help avert lapses in loan\nmonitoring and supervision.\n(ii)  Specific beneficiary targeting with clearly defined criteria is essential in microcredit\noperations; otherwise, credit might be diverted to richer households on the grounds\nof risk management and project viability.\n(iii)  Rural finance projects are successful if EAs are able to maintain their viability by\ncharging commercial interest rates to cover their costs and earn an inflation-\ncorrected return.\n(iv)  The use of subsidized credit and directed credit distorts the allocation of credit,\ncomplicates monetary policy, and introduces distortions and inefficiencies in the\nfinancial sector. The granting of liquidity credit to State-owned banks will create a\nclimate of lax financial discipline and breed more inefficiency.\n34. Lessons learned under the RCP (Appendix 7) are the following:\n(i)  The classification system for rural enterprise financing should be improved and\ncomputerized to promptly give important information for management purposes. A\nthree-tier classification comprising industry class (agroprocessing, marketing, small\nmanufacturing,  and  services),  enterprise  and  purpose  (item  financed)  is\nrecommended to be used in future credit projects.\n(ii)  Subloans supervision should be carried out more frequently at the subborrower\u2019s\nproject site. With 800 subloans to each credit officer, it is difficult to ensure effective\nsupervision. To ensure that supervision and monitoring are carried out effectively,\nit is proposed that credit staff (or field branches) be rewarded with cash incentives\nlinked to performance in recovering subloans under their responsibility.\n(iii)  VBARD and CCF should strengthen their monitoring and evaluation capacities to\nensure  that  critical  baseline  information  on  subprojects  and  subborrowers  is\ncollected from the very start so that midterm and final reviews are able to estimate\nthe socioeconomic impact of the Project.\n                                                \n14  1999. OEO. Sector Synthesis of Evaluation Findings of Rural and Agricultural Credit. ADB. December.", "10\n(iv)  VBARD  and  CCF  should  strengthen  their  environmental  units  to  ensure  that\nbranches  and  subborrowers  comply  with  environmental  laws  and  undertake\nsubprojects that are environmentally sound. The unit should establish a working\nrelationship with the relevant Government agency for the environment to promote\nenvironmental  awareness  in  the  organization  and  among  subborrowers  and\nensure that environmental assessment is integrated into subloan appraisal and\nsupervision.\n(v)  Institutional and policy reforms will be more effectively implemented if agreement\nbetween VBARD, CCF, and the Government is obtained at the start of the Project.\nA  time-bound  action  plan  for  implementing  these  reforms  should  be  clearly\ndescribed and agreed to, and should be made conditions for disbursement of the\nloan funds.\n35. The RCP shows the uneven distribution of subloans by geographic regions as well as by\nactivities. About 45 percent of loans were made in the North, 30 percent went to the Central\nregion, and 25 percent to the South. More than 70 percent of the credit line went to finance\nagricultural production and livestock and poultry; the remaining 30 percent went to aquaculture\n(7  percent),  agroprocessing,  services,  and  other  agricultural  activities  (23  percent).  The\ndistribution varies from the appraisal report, which envisaged that half of the loan would go to\nsmall-scale  agroprocessing  and  services  activities.  Also,  the  subloan  size  averaged  $500\nwhereas the allowable size of subloans was $5,000. This profile has several implications for the\nnext  Project:  there  should  not  be  subsector  allocation,  which  will  be  impractical  and\nunimplementable, and there should be a policy, which allows VBARD or PCFs to charge a risk\npremium for lending to those with insufficient collateral.\nE. ADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy\n36. A new Country Strategy and Program (CSP) under preparation for Viet Nam is expected to\nbe completed in mid-2001, in coordination with the Government\u2019s 2001-2005 Plan and 2010\nVision. The previous COS, prepared in 1995 emphasized policy and institutional reforms; social\nand economic infrastructure development; environment and natural resources management; and\nstrengthening  of  linkages  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  between  Viet  Nam  and  its\nneighboring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Overtime, the sectors assisted\nunder ADB operations have gradually expanded, and a stronger focus is being sought. The focus\nof future ADB operations will be on poverty-reducing development, which is consistent with ADB\u2019s\nrenewed emphasis on poverty reduction and with the Government\u2019s priorities.\n37. Preliminary analysis undertaken to prepare the new CSP shows that poverty in Viet Nam is\nmainly a consequence of overall low levels of income due to stunted economic growth in the past\ndecades. The poor are typically farmers with low levels of educational attainment. While inequality\nhas been growing in relative terms, income distribution is still rather egalitarian, so the scope for\nredistribution without growth is limited. In addition, poverty is largely a rural phenomenon. It is\nparticularly concentrated in three areas\u2013the northern uplands, central highlands, and north central\ncoast\u2013where poverty rates are on average 50 percent higher than the national average.\n38. Given the overall low level of income and the still fairly equitable distribution of income,\nADB\u2019s future poverty reduction strategy for Viet Nam will address (i) economic growth and private\nsector development pursued through policy reform and an improved infrastructure endowment;\nand (ii) improved human and social capital, the latter involving the strengthening of governance\nand the legal framework for development. The new CSP is considering a geographic focus on the", "11\npoorest provinces in the central region of Viet Nam. Natural resource management to reduce\nvulnerability and ensure sustainability will be systematically built into this approach.\n39. To  translate  this  approach  into  practice,  rural  development  and  rural  finance  will  be\nessential. Given the already high population density, it will be necessary to increase agricultural\nproductivity through better seeds and techniques, irrigation, and access to markets and to inputs.\nIn addition, as trading in land use rights increases and farm sizes become larger, a greater share\nof  the  rural  population  will  come  to  rely  on  alternative  sources  of  employment,  such  as\nagroprocessing and rural-based industry. Credit and support services will be essential to support\nemployment generation in these sectors.\nF. Policy Issues\n40. The Government has undertaken significant reforms in the financial system, especially in\nrural finance. With international assistance, laws were passed and promulgated, including, in\nDecember 1997, the Law on SBV and the Law on Credit Institutions, which have strengthened\nthe  financial  system.  However,  more  is  to  be  done  and  the  Government  is  committed  to\nundertake the necessary reforms to make the system more effective in promoting economic\ngrowth. This can be observed in the provisions of the IMF's PRGF and a second World Bank\nSAC under discussion for late 2000 or early 2001, and a second FSPL of ADB planned for\n2001.\n41. The following policy issues and the actions envisaged in the course of the Project in the\nrural financial and business sectors were discussed with relevant Government ministries and\ndepartments, VBARD, and the CCF-PCF.  Appendix 8 gives a summary policy matrix.\n(i) Banking regulation and supervision. VBARD does not yet fully comply with the\nprudential  regulatory  requirements  of  Decree  48.  Under  SBV  supervision,\nVBARD will be subject to the prudential regulatory norms set out in Decree\nNo. 48 including regulations on risk weighted capital adequacy, accrued income\nrecognition,  asset  classification,  and  provisioning.  SBV  will  ensure  full\nimplementation  of  the  requirements  of  Decree  48  in  VBARD,  full\noperationalization  of  the  1999  chart  of  accounts  for  Vietnamese  Accounting\nStandards  (VAS),  and  further  progress  toward  International  Accounting\nStandards (IAS) during the project period.\n(ii) Good  governance  and  management  autonomy  in  banking.  While  VBARD  is\ntechnically  autonomous,  it  is  still  subject  to  policy  lending  directives  and  its\nmanagement still refer to SBV and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on many internal\nissues.  Strengthening  governance  in  VBARD  will  provide  a  more  effective\nframework for decision making and in turn strengthen its autonomy. Under SBV\nsupervision,  VBARD  will  be  required  to  undertake  a  time-bound  program  of\nreforms  covering  organizational  structure,  banking  services  development,  risk\nmanagement,  MIS,  IT  development,  and  personnel  policies  and  training  as\nproposed and agreed upon under the strengthening of corporate governance TA at\nVBARD and recorded in the VBARD Action Plan (Appendix 3).  The program will\nstrengthen  VBARD\u2019s  governance  and  lead  to  greater  management  autonomy\nduring the project period.\n(iii) Directed lending.  Some VBARD lending to SOE, of which about 15 to 20 percent\nis estimated to be delinquent, is directed or policy lending made at the request of", "12\nthe  Government.  In  1998,  SOCBs  were  given  autonomy  and  responsibility  in\nlending decisions.  To safeguard the financial strength of VBARD, the Government\nwill take responsibility for all such loans in VBARD\u2019s portfolio under the provisions\nof Decree 178.15 The Government will identify all SOE directed lending in VBARD\u2019s\nportfolio  and  will  issue  a  binding  statement  to  VBARD,  reconfirming  their\nguaranteed status or otherwise transferring such debt from VBARD\u2019s balance\nsheet to a policy bank or another asset management vehicle within one year of\nloan effectiveness.\n(iv) Changes in portfolio composition. VBARD's new lending to SOEs in 1999 was 51\npercent of total lending and the outstanding was about 30 percent of the total\nportfolio (having declined from 69 percent in 1995). The Government\u2019s policy is to\nprogressively equitize SOEs. Present plans provide for a reduction from 6,800 to\n3,000 SOEs. In line with the changing structure of the economy, growing private\nsector participation and credit demand, and prudent asset management, VBARD\nwill continue to diversify its portfolio during the project period. VBARD will be better\nable to accomplish its mandate of improving rural financial services if it reduced its\nlending to SOEs and channeled these funds to households and rural businesses.\nAccordingly, VBARD will reduce the share of SOE lending by 2 percentage points\nper annum or a total of about 10 percent during the project period, to a maximum\noutstanding SOE lending of 20 percent of total portfolio.\n(v)  Improving deposit mobilization. Shortage of lending resources is a major constraint\nto expanding VBARD services in the rural areas and in attaining economies of\nscale in lending. VBARD recognizes the importance of being able to source its\nown funds and has made it a goal to increase mobilization of private households\nand small business savings by improving the services and facilities to the public.\nVBARD  aims  to  double  its  savings  from  individuals,  households,  and  small\nbusinesses within five years, that is to increase its savings by 15 percent per\nannum from D27,824 billion in 1999 to D53,250 billion in 2004, and to introduce\nnew products and services to diversify its customer base with support under the\nTA to improve corporate governance.\n(vi) Interest Rate Liberalization. In August 2000, the Government moved to a system\nof setting a base lending rate on a monthly basis, the rate being the average rate\nfor the prime customers of the main commercial banks (State-owned and private)\noperating in Viet Nam. Commercial banks are currently permitted to lend up to\n0.3 percent per month above this rate for short-term loans and up to 0.5 percent\nper month above this rate for medium- and long-term loans. The Government\nhas confirmed its intention to remove the remaining restrictions on interest rates\nin parallel with the restructuring of the banking system.\n(vii) Improving  the  enabling  environment  for  nonfarm  rural  businesses.  There  is\nfinancial market failure in the delivery of financial services in rural areas in Viet\nNam. That can be partially corrected by providing credit lines and other financing\nfacilities  through  rural  financial  institutions.  However,  issues  relating  to  other\nsupport  services  necessary  for  business  success  are  more  intractable.\nMechanisms that support entrepreneurs through awareness creation, business\n                                                \n15  Article 4, section 1 of Decree 178 on Loan Security provides that loan obligations of SOEs made on the instruction of\nthe Government will be guaranteed by the Government.", "13\nadvice,  information  provision  and  exchange,  training  and  promotion  are  now\nrecognized  as  crucial.  Under  the  Project,  VBARD  and  CCF-PCF  will  help  to\nestablish pilot rural business centers (RBCs) that will develop such services on a\nsustainable basis.\n(viii) Lowering of marginal tax rates. High marginal tax rates on income and enterprise\nprofits discourage entrepreneurship, inhibit employment creation, and encourage\ntax avoidance and evasion. The Government recognizes that it should stimulate\ngrowth in the micro and small enterprise (MSE) sector and intends to regularly\nreview the tax regime. \nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n42. The lack of fund resources, especially medium- and long-term capital, is a major constraint\nto the growth of rural businesses. By providing medium- and long-term funds, the Project will help\nto accelerate lending to rural businesses and encourage investment in and the adoption of new\ntechnologies, which are crucial to ensuring the survival of rural businesses in an increasingly\ncompetitive environment. By supporting VBARD16 and CCF-PCFs, which are the sole financial\ninstitutions servicing the rural sector, the Project will reach a major group of existing and potential\nbusinesses. However, credit alone will not foster the development of rural businesses. Other\nfactors, such as high tax, crowding out by SOEs for scarce credit resources, a weak legal\nframework for private corporations, lack of information on markets and technology, and lack of\ncollateral should be simultaneously tackled. Many of these issues are being addressed by the\nGovernment under various programs supported by external sources. This Project offers the\nopportunity to fortify some of these measures, such as, influencing a reduction in lending to SOEs\nin favor of private sector growth, promoting networking and information dissemination for small\nbusinesses  through  support  of  business  associations,  and  generally  strengthening  the  rural\nfinancial institutions to carry out sustainable and cost-effective lending to the rural sector. It also\ngives ADB a chance to be involved in ensuring that the reform recommendations of the TA for\nstrengthening corporate governance will be implemented over the project period and will buttress\nthe overall viability of the institution.\n43. The Project will encourage household businesses in the informal sector to transform\nthemselves  into  registered  enterprises,  enabling  better  access  to  resources  and  creating  a\nconducive  environment  for  business  expansion.  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  foster  more  balanced  and\ndiversified portfolios in VBARD and PCFs reducing their risk exposure. Because ADB funds are\nfor a long term, they will strengthen VBARD and CCF-PCFs financially by reducing their duration-\nand interest-variation risks and improving fund management.\n44. The RCP has shown that the demand for this type of credit is strong. Although the formal\nsystem reaches 50 percent of rural households, about 6 million poorer households have been\nbypassed. The loan has improved the incomes of poor households and created significant\nemployment opportunities. As major lenders to the poor, VBARD and PCFs have developed the\ninfrastructure  to  reach  poor  households  and  are  the  most  appropriate  and  cost  efficient\n                                                \n16  Currently, VBARD\u2019s outstanding loans to agro-industrial enterprises (built over several years) constitute about 3\npercent or about $70 million of its total portfolio. This is small compared with the potential demand and the capacity\nof VBARD to make loans, estimated at about $80 million per annum. Although VBARD\u2019s deposit base has grown\nrapidly in the past and will grow in the future, they consist mainly of rural household savings, which are short term\nand which VBARD has used and will use for term lending up to the prudential limit allowed by law.", "14\ninstitutions to expand financial services to those not covered so far, as well as curb the increase\nin the number of poor households and the growing disparity in rural-urban incomes.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n45. The objective aims to support the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty and promote\nprivate sector investments in rural and agrobased businesses by providing credit. The Project will\nsupport environmentally sound rural businesses to improve productivity, enhance product quality,\nand generate economic growth and employment. Potential borrowers include agricultural input\nproducers  and  suppliers;  processors  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  other  horticultural  crops;\nprocessors of industrial crops; processors of fish and livestock products; providers of services\nsuch as mechanization; small-scale manufacturers producing goods such as baskets bags, mats,\nfurniture, woven products; and operators of storage and marketing businesses.  By stimulating\nsavings, the Project will mobilize greater domestic resources for reinvestment in economic growth\nthrough financial intermediation. The Project will be implemented in rural areas of Viet Nam,\noutside the municipal boundaries of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh cities. The rural areas are broadly\ndefined to include provincial and district towns whose economic roles and functions are closely\nlinked to agricultural and rural enterprises. Special consideration will be given to areas designated\nas the poorest in the country with the objective of narrowing the gap in incomes, and to attain\nsectoral and regional balance in growth.\n46. To ensure the effectiveness of VBARD and CCF-PCFs, the Project will strengthen their\noperations to enable them to develop incentive systems, charge a risk premium of 1-2 percent on\nsubloans with insufficient collateral, improve training and training capacity, improve in lending\npractices and benefit monitoring and evaluation, and establish sustainable rural business support\nmechanisms.\n47. The components of the Project are as follows:\n1. Rural and Agribusiness Credit Delivered Through VBARD\n48. A credit line of $45.3 million (about D630 billion) will be used as follows: (i) 40 percent to\nfinance the medium- and long-term investment and semipermanent working capital needs of\nabout 3,700 rural businesses in the household and enterprise sectors, with an average subloan\nsize of $7,500 (about D105 million) including an average contribution of $2,650 per subloan by\nVBARD; (ii) 40 percent to finance the medium- and long-term investment and semipermanent\nworking capital of about 11,200 micro businesses with an average subloan size of $2,500\n(including an average contribution of $880 by VBARD), and (iii) 20 percent of the credit line to\nbe used to finance the income-generating activities of 18,500 low-income households, with an\naverage subloan size of $750 (including a contribution of $265 by VBARD).\n2.  Household and Cooperative Credit Delivered through CCF-PCF\n49. A credit line of $30 million (about D420 billion) will be used, as follows: (i) 50 percent of\nthe credit line will finance the business operations of about 31,000 low-income households\nbelow the poverty line, with an average subloan size of $750 (about D10.5 million) including an\naverage contribution of about $265 per subloan by PCFs; and (ii) the balance of 50 percent of\nthe credit line to finance 7,500 small and micro enterprises subloans of $2,500-$4,000, including\nan average contribution of $880-$1,400 by the PCFs.", "15\n3. Institutional Strengthening17\n50. Under this component, mechanisms to be instituted by VBARD will provide incentives to\ncredit officers for good performance (to be funded from 1 percent of the spread received on the\nADB loan), a system will be established by VBARD and CCF-PCFs to recover the cost involved in\nmaking loans to borrowers with collateral shortage (to be funded from fees from borrowers), CCF-\nPCF will establish a training and technology fund (to be funded from 2 percent of the spread\nreceived on the ADB loan), and $2 million will be provided under the loan for the construction of a\ncentral  training  institute  by  VBARD  and  $1  million  to  assist  VBARD  with  implementing\ncomprehensive  training  curriculum  development  and  course  design  and  general  institutional\nstrengthening in line with the recommendations of the corporate governance TA.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n51. The total cost of the Project is estimated at about $145.51 million equivalent, including\ntaxes and duties, interest on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies. The foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $60.91 million equivalent and the local currency cost at about\n$84.60 million equivalent. A summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1 and a more\ndetailed cost estimates table is in Appendix 9.\nTable 1: Project Cost\n($ million)\nProject Component Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

The\ncurrent IT environment does not provide any of the systems needed in a modern bank, although VBARD is in the\nbidding stage for a customer accounting and intra- and inter-bank payment system project, funded to the extent of\n$10 million by the World Bank. Large investments will be needed in IT development during the next five years in\nVBARD to build up the infrastructure and implement the necessary systems. VBARD\u2019s present capacity to\nimplement the required systems is limited and the Mission found that it was premature to provide investment to\nVBARD for this purpose at present. Such investment funding may be considered in the future, but should be\ncontingent on the successful implementation of the World Bank bank payment system project and the adoption by\nVBARD of a comprehensive IT development strategy. The ADB corporate governance TA is assisting VBARD\nwith preparing such a strategy.", "16\nD.  Financing Plan\n52. It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $80  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment Fund to finance about 55 percent of the total project cost. ADB will finance the entire\nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $60.91  million  equivalent,  including  the  interest  charge  during\nimplementation and $19.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost in view of the difficulties of\nmobilizing sufficient medium- and long-term domestic savings because of the low per capita\nincome  of  the  people.  Subborrowers  will  contribute  $20.54  million  equivalent  or  about  14.0\npercent of the Project cost, VBARD will provide $28.61 million equivalent or about 19.7 percent,\nand CCF-PCFs the remaining $16.36 million or 11.3 percent.\n53. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will be the Borrower of the ADB loan. The proposed\nloan will be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years. A service charge of 1 percent will be levied on the loan during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent during the amortization period. The financing plan is summarized in\nTable 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nSource\nADB 60.91 19.09 80.00 55.0\nVBARD - 28.61 28.61 19.7\nCCF-PCFs - 16.36 16.36 11.3\nSubborrowers - 20.54 20.54 14.0\nTotal 60.91 84.60 145.51 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank,  CCF = Central People's Credit Fund, PCF = People's Credit Fund, VBARD = Viet Nam\nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nE.  Executing Agencies\n54. VBARD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  rural  and  agribusiness  credit\ncomponent. The CCF will be the EA for the household and cooperative credit component.\nVBARD and CCF will be responsible for executing their respective subcomponents of the\ninstitutional strengthening component.\n55. VBARD has had experience in several projects funded by ADB, World Bank, and CIDA.\nVBARD  performed  satisfactorily  in  implementing  the  RCP  and  the  World  Bank  Agricultural\nDiversification and Bank Modernization and Rural Finance projects. It is familiar with ADB\u2019s\nimplementation procedures, and has experienced staff at its headquarters to implement a rural\nfinance project. The CCF has received several TAs and loans from bilateral and multilateral\ndevelopment institutions and has successfully implemented them. Also, under the direction of the\ninternational credit project management unit (ICPMU) of SBV, CCF has substantially implemented\nits component of the ADB-financed RCP.", "17\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization and Management\n56. Before loan effectiveness, the respective EAs will establish a suitably equipped and\nstaffed project implementation units (PIUs) at their headquarters, each with a full-time director\nresponsible for their respective components under the loan. The PIUs will be the project-specific\ncontact and focal point for ADB for all matters relating to project implementation, management,\nand coordination. The PIUs will have the following minimum key personnel: a credit officer to\nensure and facilitate implementation of credit line, evaluation staff to monitor and evaluate\nimplementation of the Project and the action plan under the corporate governance TA,  training\npersonnel to implement training programs for staff, and a budget staff to prepare relevant\nwithdrawal applications and submit periodic reports to ADB.\n57. The PIUs will be specifically responsible for (i) submitting withdrawal applications to\nADB; (ii) coordinating and consolidating project reporting requirements; (iii) overseeing the\nimplementation  of  the  various  components;  (iv)  preparing  the  bid  documents,  advertising,\nevaluation, and procurement under the Project, (v) overseeing the implementation of contracts\nawarded under (iv); (vi) undertaking benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME); (vii) in VBARD,\ntogether  with  other  departments  as  appropriate,  preparing  the  incentive  scheme  and  the\nprocedure for charging a risk premium on subloans with insufficient collateral for approval of\nADB,  supervision  and  reporting  on  their  implementation,  and  preparing  training  plans  and\nadministering the training subcomponent; (viii) in CCF, preparing the plans for establishing and\noperating the training and technology fund for ADB approval, the basis and amount of risk\npremium to be charged for subloans without sufficient collateral, and the administration of the\ntraining subcomponent; (ix) advertising the credit lines and supervising their implementation; (x)\nconducting workshops to clarify the objectives, scope, targets, and implementation plans for the\nproject  components;  (xi)  carrying  out  midterm  review  and  evaluation;  and  (xii)  producing\nprogress reports, project completion reports, and other reports as may reasonably be required\nby ADB and the project steering committee (PSC) during implementation.\n2. Project Coordination\n58. To ensure effective Project supervision and coordination, SBV will be appointed as project\ncoordination agency (PCA).  SBV will be responsible for implementing all policy aspects of the\nProject as set out in the policy matrix, overseeing implementation of the reform action plans in\nVBARD and CCF-PCF, and ensuring compliance of VBARD and CCF-PCF with all covenants in\nthe Loan and Project Agreements. SBV will also be responsible for ensuring that VBARD and\nCCF-PCF prepare detailed implementation plans, reviewing and approving the plans before their\nsubmission to ADB for further approval, and ensuring that VBARD and CCF-PCF prepare timely\nand comprehensive progress reports.\n59. In addition, the Government will form within three months of loan effectiveness a Project\nSteering Committee (PSC). The PSC will be headed by a deputy governor of SBV, and will\ncomprise the deputy general director of VBARD, the general director of CCF, the directors/deputy\ndirectors of Foreign Department, Monetary Department, and Credit Cooperative Department of\nSBV,  MOF,  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  respectively.  The  Foreign\nDepartment in SBV will be the secretariat. The PSC will meet at least twice yearly to review\nprogress and to act to remove constraints affecting project implementation including any non-\ncompliance noted by SBV in its role as PCA. The PSC will review the procedures for tendering\nand awarding of contracts for the training institute in VBARD and all other procurement under the", "18\nProject to ensure compliance with the appropriate ADB guidelines. The minutes of each meeting\nwill be submitted to ADB for information.\n3. Financing Arrangements\na. Relending and Onlending Terms and Conditions\n60. The Borrower will relend the proceeds of the loan in dong to VBARD and CCF for the\ndifferent  project  components  under  separate  financing  agreements  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\nrelending rate will be variable and based on the weighted average cost of deposit funds of the\nbanking system determined by SBV at the end of each quarter (currently estimated at 4.5\npercent). The subsidiary loans will be for a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.\nVBARD  and  CCF  will  repay  principal  and  interest  in  equal  semiannual  installments  to  the\nBorrower. The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk for the loan.\n(i)  VBARD will onlend the proceeds of the loan portion designated for the rural and\nagribusiness credit line in local currency to eligible subborrowers at an interest rate\nthat will cover cost of funds, operating costs, loan loss, and interest variation risks,\ncurrently estimated at 12.6 percent per annum, in accordance with the current\nregulation (Decision No. 242/2000/QD-NHNN1 dated August 2000). VBARD will\nevaluate  all  proposed  enterprise  and  low-income  household  subloans  in\naccordance with its standard procedures, supplemented by a cash-flow and debt-\nservice analysis. The subloan maturity will be consistent with their projected\nsubloan implementation period and debt-service capacity.\n(ii)  CCF will onlend the proceeds of the loan portion designated for the household and\ncooperative credit line in local currency to eligible PCFs at a variable rate plus a\nmargin to cover administrative cost, which is currently about 1.2-1.8 percent per\nannum above the weighted average cost of deposit funds (determined by SBV at\nthe end of each quarter or as frequently as required by the PSC). The margin to\ncover administrative costs will be decided by the management board of CCF. The\nsublending rate charged by PCFs to subborrowers will be governed by the current\nregulation (Decision No. 50/2000/QD-NHNN1 dated February 2000) of the SBV,\nand decisions of the PCF members assembly. The rate is currently 14 percent.\nPCFs will evaluate all proposed enterprise and low-income household subloans\nin accordance with prudent banking procedures, supplemented by appropriate\ncash-flow and debt-service analysis. The subloan maturity will be consistent with\nthe projected subloan implementation period and debt-service capacity of the\nenterprise financed.\n(iii)  Subloans will not be more than 85 percent of the cost of the subprojects. VBARD\nand CCF-PCF will finance not less than 31 percent of the cost of the subproject.\nSubborrowers will provide not less than 14 percent of the cost of the subproject in\nthe form of cash, material, or labor.\n61. The EAs may onlend to subborrowers who do not possess sufficient collateral, after due\nconsideration of the provisions of the regulation on collateral (Decree 165 of November 1999 and\nDecree  178  dated  December  1999)  if  the  subprojects  are  financially,  economically,  and\nenvironmentally sound. However, VBARD and CCF-PCF will charge a risk premium to cover the\nrisk from insufficient collateral. This scheme will be subject to guidelines to be agreed upon with\nADB. Detailed internal regulations of VBARD and CCF-PCFs for operating the scheme will be", "19\ndrawn up and agreed upon with ADB prior to implementation. Upon receipt of ADB\u2019s approval,\nVBARD and CCF-PCF will promptly implement the scheme.\n62. In lending to poor and low-income households, VBARD and CCF will apply a group\nlending methodology, where poor households listed and certified by the commune peoples\ncommittee according to the poverty criteria published by the Government from time to time, will\nbe mobilized and organized into joint-liability groups. VBARD and CCF may recruit the services\nof  NGOs  and  mass  organizations,  like  the  Women\u2019s  Union,  Farmers\u2019  Association,  etc.,  as\nintermediaries and catalysts in group formation, social preparation, training, and credit supervision\nof project beneficiaries. The purpose of social preparation, through which the poor will identify\ncommon problems and aspirations and form themselves into cohesive groups, is to assist in\ncreating a social infrastructure among the poor that will serve as a basis for continuing economic\nand social development initiatives. The poor will then be encouraged to save to facilitate their\nbecoming PCF members before they obtain credit. VBARD and PCFs will not discriminate against\nwomen borrowers or those from ethnic minority groups. Instead the Project recommends that\ncollateral  (which  women  lack)  should  not  be  a  reason  to  deny  a  loan.  Women  and  ethnic\nminorities are encouraged to borrow under their names to undertake livelihood and income-\ngenerating activities.\n63. To successfully carry out lending to the poor, VBARD and CCF will develop appropriate\nsystems and procedures for microcredit operations and ensure that its staff in districts and\ncommunes are committed to and fully participate in the project activities by working closely and in\npartnership  with  NGO  staff.  VBARD  and  CCF  will  appoint  staff  at  branch  level  to  closely\nsupervise, monitor, and report on subloan performance and take action as appropriate.\n64. It is widely recognized that field credit staff are overworked and under intense pressure\nto  produce  results,  failing  which  they  could  be  dismissed  from  service.  To  ensure  that\nperformance is not affected by the stern conditions placed on field credit officers, VBARD will\ncreate an incentive scheme whereby 1 percent of the subloan interest (annually) will be credited\nto an incentive fund that will be subject to guidelines to be agreed upon with ADB.  At its\ndiscretion, VBARD will apply the fund to reward existing staff through incentive payments for full\nsubloan recovery or reduce the burden on existing staff by recruiting new staff using the\nproceeds of the fund. The detailed internal regulations for operating the fund the will be drawn\nup and agreed upon with ADB prior to implementation.\nb. Free Limits and Subloan Appraisal Review\n65. As prescribed in its loan sanctioning authority policy, VBARD and CCF-PCFs will utilize\ntheir internal discretionary authorities for subloan approval. It is not envisaged that ADB\u2019s review\nof subloans for approval is necessary, since almost all subloans will be within the authority of\nthe district and provincial branches to approve. For subloans above the authority of a VBARD\nprovincial branch or individual PCF\u2013$30,000 equivalent or above in the case of VBARD and\n$10,000 in the case of PCF\u2013the subloan appraisals will be evaluated at the respective head\noffice and submitted to ADB for review and concurrence.\nc.  PCF Accreditation and Selection Criteria\n66. The CCF PIU, in consultation with the Credit Cooperative Department and Banking\nSupervision Department of SBV, will be responsible for selecting eligible accredited PCFs on\nthe  basis  of  specific  criteria.  A  PCF  will  be  required  to  meet  the  following  criteria  for\naccreditation:", "20\n(i)  has been in operation for more than one year;\n(ii)  has an interest rate policy based on obtaining self-sustainability;\n(iii)  has mobilized deposits of at least D300 million;\n(iv)  has an equity of at least one fifteenth of total assets;\n(v)  has an overdue portfolio of not more than 5 percent of outstanding loan portfolio;\n(vi)  has submitted a deposit mobilization plan;\n(vii)  has submitted a list of members below the poverty line, defined as $128 per\ncapita expenditure per annum;\n(viii)  has  shown  steady  growth  in  savings  and  introduced  new  and  innovative\nproducts;\n(ix)  has  been  submitting  periodic  information  on  financial  performance,  portfolio\nperformance, outreach, and membership, etc. in the prescribed format to SBV\nand CCF; and\n(x)  can maintain detailed records on customers, and loan portfolio performance, and\nprepare accurate financial statements on an accrual basis.\nd. Subborrower Selection Criteria\n67. Women and minority groups will be encouraged to borrow and will not be discriminated\nagainst for lack of collateral. Subborrowers may be new or current borrowers. They will be\nrequired to meet the following minimum criteria:\n(i)  be an individual, cooperative, or registered private household or incorporated\nenterprise under Vietnamese law;\n(ii)  if a current borrower, have a satisfactory credit history with no current arrears or\nrescheduled borrowings;\n(iii)  be able to contribute a minimum of 15 percent equity to the subproject;\n(iv)  be  in  compliance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  any  outstanding  loan\nagreement;\n(v)  be in compliance with the regulations of VBARD or PCFs, respectively, (including\nbeing a registered member of a PCF for PCF subloans), and\n(vi)  have proven management capacity to implement the subproject.\ne. Subproject Selection Criteria\n68. Subprojects will be required to meet the following minimum criteria:\n(i)  located in the project area,\n(ii)  be  a  potentially  profitable  and  environmentally  sound  rural  or  agrobased\nbusiness primarily engaged in nonfarm activities (defined as activities that do not\ninvolve primary agricultural production),\n(iii)  require medium- or long-term credit including semipermanent working capital for\nbusiness start-up or growth,\n(iv)  have the potential for creating new employment, and\n(v)  be a legally permissible business in Viet Nam.\nf. Portfolio Distribution and Exclusion Criteria\n69. VBARD and PCFs will ensure that the subloans:", "21\n(i)  finance a fair geographic dispersal of subprojects, including at least 10 percent of\nloans by number in less developed regions;\n(ii)  do not result in overconcentration on certain types of businesses that already\nsaturate the market;\n(iii)  give preference to export-oriented businesses;\n(iv)  are not used for pickup trucks, luxury 4-wheel drive vehicles, and other vehicles\nthat may be used substantially for noncommercial purposes;\n(v) in the case of VBARD, do not exceed $30,000 equivalent, on average are around\nthe  project  target  of  $7,500  for  average  loan  size,  are  made  only  to  small\nbusinesses  (less  than  50  employees)  and  micro  businesses  (less  than  5\nemployees)18 and at least 40 percent by value are made to micro businesses and\n20 percent to low-income households; and\n(vi) in the case of PCFs, do not exceed $10,000 equivalent, on average are around\nthe  project  target  of  $750  for  average  loan  size,  are  only  made  to  micro\nbusinesses, and that at least 50 percent of subloans are made to low-income\nhouseholds with an average annual expenditure of less than $128 per capita at\nthe time of subloan disbursement.19\ng. Revolving Fund\n70. To achieve the objectives of the Project and ensure that subprojects become commercially\nviable, credit and saving services should be made available to the beneficiaries even after project\ncompletion. Since the credit lines to VBARD and CCF are for 20 years including a grace period of\n5 years and most of the subprojects have a maturity of 3-5 years, VBARD and CCF will establish\na revolving fund, within three months of loan effectiveness, to which principal repayments of\nsubloans will be credited. The revolving fund is separate from the imprest fund and will be used\nfor the sole purpose of financing subprojects that meet the objectives of the credit lines and\ncontribute  to  economic  growth  and  employment  generation,  until  the  obligations  under  the\nFinancing Agreement have been terminated.\n4. Implementation Schedule\n71. The Project will be implemented over five years and is expected to be completed by May\n2006. Appendix 10 gives the implementation schedule.\n72. Within three months of loan effectiveness, VBARD will put in place the incentive scheme\nand the procedure for lending to subborrowers with insufficient collateral. Within one year of loan\neffectiveness, VBARD will carry out a full feasibility study for the training institute incorporating the\ndetailed plans for training curriculum development, course design, and implementation in line with\nthe recommendations of the corporate governance TA, utilizing the funding provided for this\npurpose under the loan.20 In year 1, the CCF will put in place the procedure for lending to\nsubborrowers with insufficient collateral and prepare detailed plans for use of the training and\n                                                \n18  These can include unregistered businesses.\n19  The threshold of $128 per capita expenditure has been agreed to by the Government Statistical Office and World\nBank as an appropriate threshold for dividing poor households and nonpoor households and is based on detailed\nsurvey information on the cost of basic food needs and essential nonfood expenditure. These businesses can\ninclude registered businesses.\n20  VBARD will utilize the contribution it has committed to training under the corporate governance TA to roll out the\ntraining courses designed under the TA for nonfarm business financing to all of its branches during the project\nperiod.", "22\ntechnology fund21 also utilizing the funding provided for this purpose under the loan. The internal\nregulations for these schemes, the terms of reference for preparing the feasibility study for the\nVBARD training institute, and the training plans for both VBARD and CCF-PCF will be subject to\nADB  approval.  Each  year  VBARD  will  be  bound  to  implement  a  set  of  agreed-upon\nrecommendations emanating from the corporate governance TA, with continued disbursement\ncontingent on ADB\u2019s verification that milestones have been met.  VBARD and CCF-PCF will\ninitiate the implementation of the support for rural businesses component in year 1, including the\nmonitoring and evaluation system improvements.\n5. Procurement\na.  Goods\n73. Goods and services for the Project will be acquired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. Procurement by subborrowers will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement for\nsmall-scale  projects  under  development  finance  institution  loans.  International  shopping  (IS)\nprocedures  will  be  followed  for  procurement  of  equipment,  with  emphasis  placed  on  local\navailability of after sales services and spare parts. For contracts worth less than $500,000, IS\nprocedures will be followed, while for contracts costing less than $100,000 direct purchase (DP)\nwill be followed.\nb.  Civil Works\n74. ADB will finance 67 percent of the cost of civil works for the central training institute.\nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for major civil works contracts in excess of\n$1  million.  Specifically,  in  the  institutional  strengthening  component,  civil  works  for  the\nconstruction  of  a  central  training  institute  in  Hanoi  will  be  grouped  in  one  package  and\nundertaken by a prequalified contractor to be engaged through ICB. Prequalification criteria will\nbe designed to ensure that the international contractor or associates have adequate experience\nand technical and financial capabilities. It is noted that some civil works contracts will be small\nand that foreign contractors would not be interested in bidding. In that case, local competitive\nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed.\n6. Training\n75. Twenty-four person-months of services of accredited trainers will be provided under the\ninstitutional strengthening component. The trainers will be selected in accordance with criteria\ndrawn up by VBARD and CCF with the assistance of consultants recruited under this component\nand  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Trainers  requesting  accreditation  will  be  required  to  have\ndemonstrated knowledge in their field of expertise.  VBARD and CCF-PCF will ensure that the\ndetailed training programs, including selection criteria and types, duration and proposed location\nof training courses to be undertaken are submitted to ADB for approval of the use of funds under\nthe Project.\n                                                \n21  CCF will utilize part of the fund ($224,000 equivalent) to make its contribution to the support for rural businesses\ncomponent of the Project under which it will roll out training for PCF credit officers, designed with the support of\nthe TA.", "23\n7. Consulting Services\n76. Under the institutional strengthening component, up to six domestic training course\ndevelopers  and  an  international  training  specialist  serving  for  five  person-months  will  be\nrecruited to assist VBARD with developing new training courses, in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. The domestic consultants will have training expertise and experience in\ncorporate governance, corporate planning, banking services, risk management, accounting and\nMIS, IT systems, and credit management. Their services will be provided on an intermittent\nbasis over two years. The international consultant will be a training specialist with background in\ndeveloping  training  curricula,  training  course  design,  training  trainers,  and  establishing\naccreditation systems. The specialist will make regular visits to Viet Nam over two years.22\n8. Disbursement Arrangements\n77.  ADB\u2019s direct payment/commitment procedure will be followed for disbursing ADB\u2019s share\nof eligible expenditure on goods procured through IS and for payments to international consultants\nor training institutes. To ensure effective project implementation and timely disbursement, within\none month of loan effectiveness VBARD and CCF will open as a \u201cservicing bank\u201d to be appointed\nby SBV, separate imprest accounts denominated in US dollars. The accounts will be operated\nand maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements (1996). ADB will\nadvance three months of estimated expenditures into the imprest accounts: $3 million for VBARD\nand $2 million for CCF. Direct foreign exchange payments or letters of credit as well as local\ncurrency expenditures may be paid out of the imprest account.\n78. The ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the\nimprest accounts for contracts or subloans below $50,000. Apart from the documentary evidence\nof satisfactory utilization of loan advances, disbursement from the credit lines for VBARD will be\nbased on the satisfactory implementation of recommendations under the corporate governance\nTA and for CCF, on fulfillment of the time-bound Institutional Development Plan proposed by the\nSBV under the recently concluded Evaluation of the Pilot Operations of PCF Network. Upon\nreaching the amount of $15 million in the total CCF credit line component of $30 million, all\nsubsequent disbursements will be subject to prior approval from SBV. The Mission has reviewed\nthe accounting systems of the EAs and finds them adequate for the purpose of ADB\u2019s imprest\naccount and statement of expenditure procedures.\n9. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n79. The EAs will prepare semiannual reports on project implementation and overall operations\nand  management.  The  reports  will  include  information  on  (i)  expenditure  for  the  different\ncomponents; (ii) credit disbursement, recoveries, overdues, outstanding loans, and status of\nrevolving fund; (iii) deposit mobilization efforts and performance; and (iv) physical progress of all\nproject activities including compliance with covenants. In addition, the EAs will prepare quarterly\nreports on (i) implementation of the incentive scheme, the procedure for lending to subborrowers\nwith insufficient collateral, and progress of training subcomponents, (ii) reforms that are being\nundertaken and their progress; and (iii) utilization of the training and technology fund of CCF.\n80. The EAs will maintain separate records and accounts, adequate to identify goods and\nservices financed out of the proceeds of the loan and to disclose its use in the Project, following\n                                                \n22  See Supplementary Appendix C for the detailed terms of reference of consultants.", "24\nsound  accounting  principles,  and  will  have  such  accounts  and  records  audited  annually  by\nauditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited report together with the auditor\u2019s\nopinion will be submitted to the Government and ADB, within nine months of the close of the\nfinancial year 2000 and thereafter six months of the close of the financial year. Independent\nauditors acceptable to ADB will carry out annual audits of VBARD, CCF, RCFs, and PCFs. CCF\nwill have accounts and records of RCFs and PCFs participating under the Project audited once\nevery two years by external auditors, in accordance with sound auditing standards, acceptable\nto ADB. Such audits may be paid from the training and technology fund established under the\nProject. Within six months of the close of the financial year, CCF will submit to ADB and the\nGovernment certified copies of such audits with the auditor\u2019s opinion.\n81. Within six months after the closing date of the loan, the EAs will prepare and submit to\nADB, a project completion report, in a format acceptable to ADB, on the utilization and impact of\nthe loan on the intended beneficiaries and the economy.\n10. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n82. The Project will be implemented over five years and is expected to be completed by May\n2006. VBARD and CCF will carry out a baseline survey of a stratified sample of rural households\nthat  is  representative  of  the  rural  community  as  a  whole,  within  three  months  of  loan\neffectiveness.23 The Government, EAs, PCA, and ADB will carry out a comprehensive midterm\nreview at the end of year 2 of project implementation to evaluate actual physical and financial\nprogress,  review  the  relative  allocations  of  the  loan  to  VBARD  and  CCF-PCF  credit  line\ncomponents, BME, compliance with specific covenants, and the performance of the PIUs. Based\non this review, modifications and improvements to the Project will be made and implemented.\nADB will carry out annual reviews throughout project implementation.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n83. VBARD and PCFs will ensure that the approach to sublending is environmentally sound\nand makes a contribution to environmental protection. In the lending processes, VBARD and\nPCFs will raise customers' awareness of environmental responsibilities by requiring borrowers\nto provide copies of all environmental permits prior to loan disbursement, where such permits\nare required; including a standard environmental loan covenant in all loan agreements to specify\nthe borrowers' environmental responsibilities; and monitoring compliance with loan covenants\nand taking corrective action if noncompliance is detected. 24 A summary initial environmental\nexamination is in Appendix 11.\n84. VBARD and PCFs will address poverty issues by applying a group lending methodology\nwhere poor households, listed and certified by the commune people's committees according to\nthe poverty criteria published by the Government from time to time, will be mobilized and\norganized into joint-liability groups. VBARD and CCF may recruit the services of NGOs and mass\norganizations, like the Women\u2019s Union, Farmers\u2019 Association, etc., as intermediaries and catalysts\nin group formation, social preparation, training, and credit supervision of project beneficiaries.\nVBARD and CCF will develop appropriate systems and procedures for microcredit operations and\nensure that their staff in districts and communes are committed to and fully participate in the\nproject activities by working closely and in partnership with NGO staff. Further, VBARD and CCF\nwill comply with the portfolio structure criteria that will ensure that (i) at least 15 percent of\n                                                \n23  See Supplementary Appendix E on BME and Midterm Review.\n24  See Supplementary Appendix F for IEE.", "25\nVBARD's subloans are for micro enterprises and 20 percent are for financing income-generating\nactivities of low-income households with per capita expenditure per annum of less than $128,\nand (ii) that 50 percent of PCF subloans are for households with annual per capita expenditure\nof less than $128 at the time of subloan disbursement. Introducing a scheme for lending to\nsubborrowers with insufficient collateral and expanding joint-liability group lending under the\nProject will facilitate access to credit for those with collateral deficiency. The development of\nRBCs will provide a focal point for empowering local businesses and fostering self-help and\nentrepreneurship.25\nH.  Technical Assistance\n85. As requested by the Government, an advisory TA for Support of Rural Businesses is\nproposed to be implemented in association with the Project. The TA aims to establish on a pilot\nbasis sustainable rural business centers (RBCs) that will provide rural entrepreneurs and farm\nhouseholds with business advice, credit facilitation service, market information, and training, as\nwell as to lobby with Government on issues affecting their livelihood. A TA framework and the\nTA cost are in Appendix 12.\n86. Under the Project, credit lines are provided to finance the medium- and long-term capital\nneeds of rural enterprises and poor households. However, credit alone will not maximize the\ngrowth of these businesses, which also need training, information, advice, and an operating\nenvironment conducive to growth. Line ministries, and research and technical institutes have\nlittle outreach in the rural areas and are not able to provide the services demanded by rural\nentrepreneurs and households. There is an urgent need for an alternative to Government\nextension  services  that  can  provide  the  assistance  required  by  rural  businesses  on  a\nsustainable basis to ensure their growth and success. Private sector operated services that\ncater to the special needs of rural businesses and households have been successfully tried in\nother developing countries and it is proposed that they be established in collaboration with this\nProject.\n87. The  TA  will  assist  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  businesses  through  the\nsponsorship  of  three  RBCs.  The  RBCs  will  be  established  through  a  competitive  process\nwhereby individuals, private sector entities, or partnerships between public sector organizations\nand private sector entities will submit business plans for establishing RBCs in selected rural\nareas. The plans will be evaluated on the basis of the services to be provided; their practicality,\neffectiveness, and sustainability; their ability to leverage other funds, and likely impact on rural\nentrepreneurs and households.\n88. The TA will (i) create sustainable support services for nonfarm rural businesses and\nimprove  the  quality  of  lending  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  lending  and  business\nperformance through the establishment of at least three pilot RBCs in different regions of Viet\nNam using different modalities for service delivery; (ii) provide start-up support to RBCs, and\ndevelopment of credit facilitation, business advisory, and training capacity in RBCs; (iii) develop\nimproved lending and credit management procedures in PCFs and related training materials\nand courses for PCF staff; and (iv) develop improved monitoring and evaluation systems for\nVBARD and PCFs to provide ongoing management information on the credit lines and on the\nnonfarm rural business sector and for carrying out effective baseline and evaluation surveys.\n                                                \n25  See Supplementary Appendix G for social assessment.", "26\n89. The TA will provide funding on a phased and reducing basis, not to exceed $100,000\nover three years per RBC. RBCs will be expected to be indigenous organizations or individuals.\nThe cost of expatriate personnel will not be eligible for funding. Consulting services will be\nprovided to assist in developing (i) improved lending and credit management procedures for\nPCFs and related training materials and courses for PCF staff, and (ii) improved monitoring and\nevaluating systems for VBARD and PCFs.\n90. Collectively RBCs are expected to impact directly on at least 600 rural businesses over\nthe project period. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,440,000 equivalent, comprising\n$626,000 in foreign exchange cost and $814,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will\nfinance $626,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost for the services of international and\ndomestic  consultants,  purchase  of  computer  and  training  equipment  and  software,  and\ncommunications  and  report  production  costs;  and  $374,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  local\ncurrency cost for start-up and administrative cost of RBCs, costs of workshops, seminars, and\ntraining courses; and domestic travel. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the\nADB-funded TA program. VBARD and CCF will finance the remaining local costs of $440,000\nequivalent. The terms of reference of international and domestic consultants and estimated\ncosts of various components of the TA are given in Supplementary Appendix D.\n91. SBV will be the EA. The Implementing Agency in establishing and supervising the RBC\nwill be SBV, while the PIUs in VBARD and CCF will be responsible for implementing the\ncomponents involving improving lending and credit management procedures (in PCFs) and\nimproving monitoring and evaluation systems (for VBARD and PCFs). The PSC will approve the\nuse of TA funds to support the establishment of RBCs.\n92. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants, a team of consultants comprising three\ninternationally recruited specialists will be selected for a total of about 12 person-months of\nconsulting  services:  an  MSE  support  service  specialist/team  leader  with  a  background  in\ndeveloping a wide range of support services and the formation of MSE support organizations, a\nmicro and small business training specialist with a background in assisting MSEs to improve\nmanagement practices and in facilitating credit and access to other services, and an MSE credit\nspecialist with a background in MSE lending and business advisory service development. The\nspecialists will regularly visit Viet Nam spread over 18 months.\n93. Domestically recruited specialists in related areas will work closely with the international\nspecialists. Three domestically recruited specialists with expertise in media and information\nservices, credit and training, and database development will be required for a total of 18 person-\nmonths of consulting services. The domestically recruited consultants will have a key role in\nassisting VBARD to launch the rural business support service initiative and will undertake\nimprovements to PCF lending and monitoring and evaluation. Their inputs will be provided on\nan intermittent basis over a period of 18 months.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial Analysis\n1.  Financial Viability and Benefits of Credit Lines\n94. The Project is expected to finance a wide range of agribusinesses and rural businesses,\nincluding activities that can be carried out by low-income households with per capita incomes of", "27\nless than $128 per year. The mix of subprojects that will be financed cannot be predicted with\nany accuracy in terms of the scale and relative proportions of different activities as the Project\nwill be responsive to market demand. Therefore, while financial and economic analyses of the\noverall Project are not feasible, financial analysis of indicative subprojects was carried out.\nCredit line funds will be used for medium- and long-term investments and so benefit-cost ratios\nand financial internal rate of returns (FIRRs) provide the best measures of subproject viability. A\ncross section of subprojects with total investment costs of $200-$50,000 and subloan sizes of\n$180-$30,000 gave benefit-cost ratios of 1.04-1.29 at a 12 percent discount rate, and FIRRs of\nbetween 14 and 56 percent. Sensitivity analysis of reduction in sales prices and increases in\ncosts  showed  that  most  subprojects  could  withstand  5  percent  sales  reductions  or  cost\nincreases. Most of them remained viable with 10 percent sales reduction or cost increases. The\nexceptions were subprojects involving bulk processing of commodities or characterized by high\nvolumes and low value added. However, in general such businesses are able to adjust to\ncommodity price changes because their stocks are not high and they tend to be cost-plus\nbusinesses, adding processing costs and a profit margin to the cost of raw materials.\n95. The  main  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  incomes  for  49,300  low-income\nhouseholds under the VBARD and CCF-PCF credit line components, and creation of new\nemployment opportunities in and generation of increased incomes for some 7,500 businesses\nunder the CCF-PCF credit line component and some 14,500 businesses under the VBARD\ncredit line component. The Project\u2019s unquantifiable benefits will be substantive. They include (i)\nacceleration of reforms in VBARD and in financial sector deepening; (ii) strengthening of staff\nskills in both VBARD and CCF-PCFs through training; (iii) improvements in monitoring leading\nto more proactive project management; (iv) the incentives to VBARD staff to perform more\neffectively, particularly in credit management; (v) wider access to credit through the introduction\nof the VBARD scheme for lending to subborrowers with insufficient collateral; (vi) improved\nenvironment for micro and small business operations; and (vii) introduction of support services\nfor micro and small businesses in rural areas.\n2.  Risks\n96. Although the Government has further liberalized interest rate and replaced the ceiling on\nlending rates by a rate determined by the prime lending rate of the nine largest commercial\nbanks (private and State-owned), it continues to control the maximum rate that can be charged\nby banks. As such, there still remains the risk that interest spread may be inadequate for both\nCCF-PCFs  and  VBARD,  which,  it  is  recognized,  have  to  incur  additional  costs  to  reach\nborrowers and savers in the communes and villages. Any inadequacy in the spread afforded to\nVBARD and CCF-PCFs by SBV may affect their ability to provide acceptable service quality,\nwith potentially adverse effects on their portfolio.\n97. Normal commercial credit risks are associated with all of the subloans. Additionally,\nalthough the Government is committed to full implementation of management autonomy in\nfinancial sector institutions\u2013and this is largely in place with private sector lending\u2013at a local level\nthere remain risks that external interference in lending decisions will result in poor loans. The\ntraining  of  VBARD  and  CCF-PCF  credit  staff  under  the  Project,  the  incentive  scheme  for\nVBARD staff, the scheme for lending to subborrowers with insufficient collateral, the review of the\nadequacy of spreads for delivering financial services, the improved monitoring systems, support\nservices  for  rural  businesses,  and  milestone  commitments  made  by  VBARD  for  reform\nimplementations will all help to mitigate these risks.", "28\nB.  Environment\n98. In general the environmental impact of subloans will not be significant. Most subprojects\nwill be small and any environmental effects localized. The initial environmental examination\nshows that there is minor potential for nuisances and hazards normally associated with small-\nscale commercial enterprises, but that all of these are within the power of the subborrowers to\nrectify. VBARD and PCFs will ensure that the approach to sublending is environmentally sound\nand makes a contribution to environmental protection. In the lending processes, VBARD and\nPCFs  will  raise  customer\u2019s  awareness  of  environmental  responsibilities  by  using  a  simple\nscreening process to ensure that activities on an exclusion list are not financed; requiring\nborrowers to provide copies of all environmental permits prior to loan disbursement, where such\npermits are required; including a standard environmental loan covenant in all loan agreements\nto specify the borrower\u2019s environmental responsibilities; and monitoring compliance with loan\ncovenants and taking corrective action if noncompliance is detected.\nC.  Poverty Impact\n99. Some 70 percent of subloans will go to about 49,500 low-income households with per\ncapita expenditure of less than $128 per year, making the Project a core poverty intervention\nunder ADB's current as well as year 2001 new typology. A further 22,400 subloans will go to\nmicro  and  small  businesses  with  employment  creation  potential.  In  total  some  101,700\nadditional jobs will be created by the Project at an average annual wage of $325. At full\ndevelopment, the additional annual income of subborrowers and their employees is estimated to\nbe $157 million equivalent.\n100. The additional income and employment generated will result in poor households being\nbetter able to satisfy basic needs for food, clothing, and housing. Employment for the poor and\nthe unemployed will help to empower them so they can represent themselves better in their\ncommunities. For the subborrower\u2019s family, increased incomes through employment of others\nmay free up family labor, particularly the youth, to allow more time for education and personal\ndevelopment. Savings from increased income will contribute to reinvestment while increased\nexpenditure will stimulate demand in the local economy compounding poverty reduction effects.\nRBC development will empower entrepreneurs to improve the business operating environment\nand in turn attract others to business.\nD. Social Dimensions\n101. By making credit available to enable farmers to invest in rural business activities, the\nProject will assist in diversifying and restructuring the sector and in strengthening the linkages\nbetween agriculture and nonfarm businesses. It will also widen and upgrade the rural skills base,\nencourage the participation of more women in value-added activities at or near home, foster new\ntypes of MSEs, and produce new types of goods for the domestic market and for export. It will\ncontribute to alleviating regional imbalance by promoting business in rural areas that will enable\nthe rural economy to be integrated into the growth led by export-oriented urban industries.\n102. The Project will contribute to the growth and strengthening of VBARD and CCF-PCFs\nand enhanced financial intermediation in the rural areas. It is in line with the main objectives of\nthe country\u2019s Five-Year Economic Development Plan. The rationale of increasing production\nand incomes of rural poor households and enterprises accords with both the Government\u2019s and\nADB\u2019s policies and strategies. Only potentially viable and profitable subprojects will be financed", "29\nunder the Project. Based on the ongoing experience of the RCP, about 101,700 full-time jobs\nare envisaged to be created.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n103. The Government, VBARD, and CCF have given the following assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Upon  loan  effectiveness,  SBV  will  include  VBARD  in  the  inspection  on  risk\nweighted capital adequacy and accrued income recognition in line with Decree\nNo.  48/1998/QD-NHNN5  dated  5  February  1999.  Within  one  year  of  loan\neffectiveness, SBV will also define the asset classification and provisioning policy\nfor VBARD taking into consideration its unique character as a development bank.\n(ii)  Within six months after loan effectiveness, the Government will identify all of the\nSOE directed lending in VBARD\u2019s loan portfolio and will issue within one year of\nloan effectiveness a binding statement to VBARD reconfirming the guaranteed\nstatus of SOE loans directed by Government, or otherwise transfer such loans to\na newly created policy bank or other asset management vehicle.\n(iii)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, SBV, and VBARD and CCF through their\nrespective PIUs, will operationalize RBCs to be established under the TA for\nsupport for rural businesses.\n(iv)  No subloans will be made by VBARD to SOEs from the proceeds of the ADB\nloan and VBARD will reduce the outstanding loans to SOE in accordance with\nthe Government's overall program to reduce the number of SOEs.\n(v)  VBARD will rationalize its organizational structure to reduce spans of control,\nincrease  delegation  of  authority,  clarify  chains  of  command,  group  together\nfunctionally related departments and remove potential for conflict of interest;\nformulate and document revised policies for payment, deposit, loan, and service\nproducts; formulate and document revised policies for the management of credit,\nliquidity,  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  and  operational  risks;  formulate  and\ndocument  revised  policies  for  accounting,  budgeting,  and  management\ninformation; formulate and document revised policies for personnel management,\njob descriptions, staff hiring, performance evaluation, compensation, promotion,\nand training in accordance with the agreed upon Action Plan; and implement the\nAction Plan within the specified time frame.\n(vi)  VBARD and CCF will operate in a self-sustainable manner based on prudential\ncommercial banking practices and will at all times maintain compliance with the\nlaw and banking regulations of SBV, including maintaining adequate capital. In\nthis context, the Government has assured that it would infuse additional capital\ninto VBARD as soon as the 1999 audit confirms a capital shortage.\n(vii)  The  Credit  Cooperative  Department  and  Banking  Supervision  Department  of\nSBV will continue to supervise CCF-PCFs and provide support for training CCF-\nPCF  staff  and  borrowers.  They  will  submit  regular  reports  to  ADB  on  the", "30\nperformance and weaknesses of the CCF-PCFs as determined from time to time\nuntil such time that the CCF-PCF network is fully autonomous.\n(viii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, VBARD and CCF will establish and\nmaintain  separate  Project-specific  revolving  funds  to  credit  proceeds  from\nrepayment of the principal of the subloans to the fund, after any debt servicing\npayments in respect of the subsidiary loans. The resources in the revolving fund\nwill be utilized exclusively to finance subloans similar to those made under the\nProject in accordance with the Project Agreements. The revolving fund accounts\nwill be audited annually.\n(ix)  A review of the relending and onlending rates will be carried out annually by\nMOF, SBV, VBARD, CCF-PCFs, and ADB to ensure that the average spread is\nadequate to cover the cost of operations and loan losses of VBARD and CCF-\nPCFs.\n(x)  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  VBARD  and  CCF  will  establish\nmonitoring  systems  for  project  implementation,  will  ensure  that  systems  and\nprocedures  to  implement  the  Project  are  adequate,  targets  are  regularly\ntransmitted to the branches, and performance is measured.\n(xi)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, VBARD and CCF will prepare and\nsubmit to ADB the guidelines and detailed internal regulations for (a) the risk\npremium scheme, and (b) incentive scheme fund for VBARD.\n(xii)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, VBARD and CCF will prepare and submit\nto  ADB  their  detailed  training  plans.  In  addition,  VBARD  will  prepare  a  full\nfeasibility study for the central training institute including the detailed plans for\ndeveloping a training curriculum, course design and implementation.\n(xiii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, the Government will cause CCF to\nsubmit to ADB and SBV the approved time-bound Institutional Development Plan\nprepared under the recently concluded Evaluation of the Pilot Operations of the\nPCF network.\nB.

Legal Framework, Ownership, and Basic Objectives\n1. Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) was established in March 1988\nout  of  the  former  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam's  (SBV)  Agriculture,  Fisheries  and  Salt  Production\nDepartment.  In 1990, the Vietnamese banking system was reorganized into a two-tier structure, with\nSBV relinquishing most retail lending operations and assuming the role of a central bank.  In the same\nyear, the various lending departments of SBV together with VBARD received their charters and were\ntransformed into State-owned commercial banks (SOCBs).  VBARD operates under the framework of\nthe Law on the SBV and the Law on Credit Institutions. It is wholly owned by the Government through\nSBV and is subject to the prudential directives of SBV.  Under its charter, VBARD is allowed to carry\nout  commercial  banking  and  development  banking  activities  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy  with\nemphasis  on  agriculture  and  rural  development.  It  also  has  autonomy  in  operating  and  financial\nmanagement. In its recently adopted mission statement, VBARD aims to be the leading commercial\nbank in the agriculture and rural enterprise sectors and its overriding corporate objective is to deliver\nsustained and superior financial returns to its owners.\nB. Organization, Management, Staffing, and Operations\n2. The management of VBARD is under the overall supervision of a six-member board of directors,\nwhich meets regularly to discuss policy matters.  The day-to-day operation of VBARD is managed by a\nmanagement team comprising the general director and five deputy general directors in charge of the\nfunctional  departments.  Each  of  the  13  functional  departments  is  headed  by  a  director.  Credit\noperations  are  under  the  supervision  of  two  credit  departments  namely,  Enterprise  Credit  and\nCooperative and Household Credit.  At end-August 2000, VBARD had two regional representative\noffices in Ho Chi Minh City and Danang, respectively, 4 transaction centers, 62 provincial branches,\n689 district branches, 1,282 intercommune branches, and 52 mobile banks. Total staff numbered\n23,110, of which, 313 are in the Head Office and about 30 percent (7,000) are specialized credit staff.\n1. Operating Policies and Procedures\n3. The basic policies observed by VBARD are prescribed in the Law on SBV, the Law on Credit\nInstitutions, the VBARD Charter, and regulations issued by SBV and Ministry of Finance (MOF) from\ntime to time. The main financial policies are summarized as follows: (i) VBARD will give priority to\nfinancing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agriculture and rural sectors that are\nengaged in food production, are labor intensive and are export-oriented or import substitutes; (ii)\nVBARD will maintain a minimum adequacy ratio of 8 percent; (iii) VBARD will maintain minimum\nliquidity reserve ratio of 5 percent of total deposits less than 12 months and minimum current ratio of\none; (iv) the maximum ratio of short-term funds allowed for extending medium- and long-term loans is\n25 percent; (v) assets with arrears in payment are to be suitably classified and prudent provision for\nlosses made (Decision 48/1999/QD-NHNN5); (vi) single borrower limit will not exceed 15 percent of net\nworth; (vii) VBARD will adopt the chart of accounts issued by SBV, including accounting for loan\ninterest income on accrual basis (Decision 435/1998/QD-NHNN5); and (viii) VBARD\u2019s annual financial\nstatements will be audited by independent auditors from FY1999. These policies provide generally\nadequate guidelines for VBARD\u2019s operations.\n2. Past Operations\n4. A summary of VBARD\u2019s operations for  FY1995-FY1999 is in Table A2.1.  Details are on\npage 6.", "35\nAppendix 2, page 2\nTable A2.1: Summary of  VBARD\u2019s Operations\nFY1995 \u2013 FY1999\n(D billion)\nAudited Unaudited Av Growth (%)\nFY ending 31 December 1995 1996 1997 1998            1999 1995-1999\nTotal Resources 17,772 22,251 25,106 32,134 37,503 20.5\nLoan Portfolio 14,086 17,689 20,607 24,338 29,583 20.4\nDeposits with SBV & banks 2,485 2,836 3,207 6,305 6,058 24.9\nDeposits from customers 11,351 13,479 17,850 21,510 25,111 22.0\nBorrowings from SBV & banks 4,550 6,143 4,922 6,524 5,918             6.8\nBorrowing from international 503 848 1,216 2,273 2,899 54.9\nagencies\nSBV = State Bank of Viet Nam.\n5. VBARD\u2019s total resources grew at an average annual rate of 20.5 percent during the period, and\nstood at D37,503 billion ($2.68 billion equivalent) in 1999. Loan financing accounts for about 79 percent\nof total assets and grew at about 16 percent in 1997 and 1998, and 22 percent in 1999.  Deposit\nmobilization grew strongly at 22 percent a year and accounted for about 67 percent of total resources.\nDeposits mobilized traditionally accounted for about 78-88 percent of total lending each year. Other\nimportant sources of funds are borrowing from SBV and banks, which account for 16-27 percent during\nthe period.  Borrowings from international agencies accounted for 2.8 percent of total resources in 1995\nand 7.7 percent in 1999. The loan portfolio at end-1999 was D29,583 billion ($2,113 million equivalent)\nwith an average loan size of about $300, growing by about 20 percent per annum (Table A2.2). Loans to\nhouseholds and to non-SOE enterprises accounted for 71 percent of the total loan portfolio (72 percent\nin 1998). Loans to SOEs, operating mainly in agriculture, at end 1999 amounted to 29 percent of the\nportfolio (having declined from 69 percent of total loan portfolio in 1995). By loan term, 39 percent\n(23 percent in 1995) of total loans in 1999 were medium and long term, with the rest, short term. By\neconomic activity, agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture accounted for 61 percent (74 percent in 1998)\nfollowed by food processing and others accounting for 25 percent (11 percent in 1998), while industry,\nand trading and services accounted for 7 percent each.\nTable A2.2: VBARD, Portfolio Details, December 1999\n(D billion)\nHouseholds State- As %\n& Owned of\nPortfolio Details Cooperatives Enterprises Non-SOE Total Total\n(SOE)\nOutstanding by Sector and Borrower Type\nAgriculture 11,797 5,066 0 16,863 57\nForestry 190 105 0 295 1\nFishing, Aquaculture, and Salt Production 777 111 0 888 3\nIndustry 339 1,424 308 2,071 7\nTrading and Services 1,144 726 201 2,071 7\nOthersa 5,110 1,226 1,059 7,395 25\nTotal 19,357 8,658 1,568 29,583 100\nAs % of Loan  Portfolio 65 29 5 100\nOutstanding by Maturity and Borrower Type\nShort-Term 11,632 5,159 1,254 18,045 61\nMedium- and Long-Term 7,845 3,419 273 11,537 39\na  Including foreign currency loans.\nSource: Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.", "36\nAppendix 2, page 3\n6. The lower share of term loans in the portfolio in the past has been due to, among others, the\ninverted lending rate structure where, until end-1997, interest rate on short-term loans was higher. This\nencouraged short-term lending and was a disincentive for mobilizing long-term deposits. This has been\ncorrected. Interest rates determination has been progressively liberalized and has since August been\nbased on the average prime rate determined on a monthly basis by SBV.1 However, SBV continues to\ncontrol  the  margin  over  the  prime  rate  that  banks  can  charge  rural  borrowers.  This  puts  at  a\ndisadvantage the rural financial institutions whose transaction costs are relatively higher. It restrains their\npotential outreach and is likely to continue to create a scarcity of medium- and long-term resources.  It is\nestimated that VBARD is  able to meet only a fraction of the term resources demanded by small\nbusinesses. Because of the scarcity of credit, VBARD often resorts to credit rationing by funding a small\nproportion of the project requirements or provide short-term credit (less than 12 months) where demand\nis essentially of a long-term nature.\n7. As of 31 August 2000, VBARD\u2019s total arrears were estimated at D7,875 billion (including frozen\nloans of D1,024 billion) or 19.5 percent (17.4 percent excluding frozen loans) of the total loan portfolio.\nCumulative provision for doubtful debts (D2,285 billion) and frozen loans   amounted to D3,308 billion or\n8.2 percent of total portfolio (42 percent of total arrears).  Frozen loans represent mostly loans to SOEs,\nwhich are guaranteed by the Government.  Loan arrears above 360 days are about 50 percent of total\narrears, most of which (especially loan arrears of households and small enterprises) are caused by cash\nflow problems contributed by VBARD\u2019s practice of extending short-term loans for activities with a long-\nterm  maturity.  Other  main  causes  of  late  payments  were  business  failures  due  to  poor  economic\nconditions and crop failures due to natural calamities (as opposed to willful default).\n3. Projected Operations\n8. Details of VBARD\u2019s projected operations for 2000-2004 are provided on para. 11 and Table 2.4.\nThe loan portfolio is expected to increase from D29,583 billion (FY1999) to D66,800 billion (FY2004) or\naverage 17.7 percent a year.  Deposit mobilization is projected to grow from D 25,111 billion (FY1999) to\nD52,480 billion (FY2004) or average 15.9 percent a year. Total assets are expected to increase from D\n37,503 billion (FY1999) to D 76,686 (FY 2004), or an average of 15.4 percent a year.  The growth of\nassets will be funded mainly from deposit mobilization (70 percent); borrowings from other banks,\ninternational agencies, and SBV (20 percent); capital contributions from government to meet capital\nadequacy requirement (7 percent), and accumulated earnings (3 percent).\nD. Accounting, Audit, and Financial Controls\n9. VBARD\u2019s accounts are maintained in accordance with the Vietnamese accounting standards\n(VAS) designed by SBV.  To facilitate central planning, the accounting systems adopted in Viet Nam for\nbanks  are  reasonably  uniform.    VAS  for  banks  was  recently  revised  to  bring  it  much  closer  to\ninternationally accepted practice.  Interest is now required to be accounted for on an accrual basis, and\nas  mentioned  earlier,  assets  with  payment  in  arrears  are  required  to  be  classified  and  prescribed\nprovision for losses made (Decision 48).  The new chart of accounts, issued under Decision 435 by SBV\ngives  guidance  on  presenting  the  balance  sheet;  however,  there  are  still  no  other  guidelines  for\npreparing and presenting financial statements.  VBARD\u2019s skills in this area, however, have improved\nmeasurably  through  experience  gained  from  international  audits  during  the  past  few  years.  The\naccounting system in the head office, and provincial and district branches are computerized, while that in\nthe intercommune branches is partially computerized. The accounting system consists of a series of\n                                                          \n1  In August 2000, as part of its continuing effort to liberalize interest rates, SBV introduced a new system of allowing banks to\nset lending rates, at a margin not exceeding 0.3 percent per month for short-term loans and 0.5 percent per month for\nmedium- and long-term loans above the average prime rate of 0.75 percent . The average prime rate is based on the prime\nrates of nine leading local and foreign banks and will be announced by SBV on a monthly basis. In line with SBV\u2019s reduction\nof ceiling lending rates, the effective rate of interest on demand deposits decreased from 0.4-0.6 percent per month (January\n1999) to 0.1-0.35 percent (December 1999); 3 month deposit rate from 0.7-0.95 percent per month to 0.3-0.45 percent; 6-\nmonth deposit rate from 0.85-1.0 percent per month to 0.4-0.6 percent; and 12-month deposits, from 0.9-1.1 percent per\nmonth to 0.5-0.65 percent.", "37\nAppendix 2, page 4\nidentical stand-alone systems in each branch, which are not integrated either to each other or to the\nhead office. Each provincial branch therefore operates, to a large extent, as an independent information\nprocessing center with summary reports being sent up to the head office, via modem, for consolidation\npurposes.  Control over the accounting functions of the branches is exercised through directives, regular\nreports submitted to the head office, and periodic visits.  The internal inspection/audit department of\nVBARD reports directly to the general director, inspection of branches is carried out regularly, at least\nonce  a  year.    VBARD\u2019s  accounts  have  been  audited  by  an  international  audit  firm\n(PriceWaterHouseCoopers) for the past six years.  Completion of audit, however, had always been\ndelayed (FY1998 audit was only completed in late August 2000).  This is unsatisfactory. In line with the\nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  requirement,  audited  accounts  should  be  completed  within  six\nmonths of financial year-end.  VBARD\u2019s statutory audit of annual accounts is also conducted by SBV.\nE. Past Financial Performance\n10. International  auditors  audited  VBARD\u2019s  financial  statements  from  FY1993  to  FY1998.  The\nunaudited accounts of 1999 indicates a net profit of D131 billion ($9.4 million).  Net losses in 1997 and\n1998 caused VBARD\u2019s net worth to become negative, necessitating an injection of capital amounting to\nD 1,492.9 billion in 1998. This, however, was inadequate. Based on the Mission\u2019s financial projections\ndeveloped with VBARD, further capital contribution of D1,563 billion is required to bring the capital\nadequacy ratio to 8 percent in 2000. These historical results highlight the importance of maintaining\nquality loan portfolio, adequate interest spread, more optimal liquidity management, and improving the\noperating ratio.  During 1996 to 1999, the interest spread was between 3.2 percent to 4.4 percent; the\nratio of cash holding and liquidity reserve with SBV to total deposits was high, ranging from 14 percent to\n23 percent; the operating ratio was between 95.7 percent and 117 percent; and the return on equity was\nnegative in three of the four years.

Income Statement\n(i)  Growth is estimated at 12.6 percent a year. Interest income on average loans and\ndeposits with banks is estimated at 12.9 percent (FY2000) to 11.5 percent (FY2004).\nInterest income on average total assets is estimated at 12.3 percent (FY2000) to 11\npercent (FY2004).\n(ii)  The spread of interest income to average total assets and interest expense to average\ntotal assets is maintained at 3.8 percent a year.\n(iii)  Fees, commissions, dividends and other income are expected to grow at 11.2 percent a\nyear.\n(iv)  Interest expense growth is estimated at 11.2 percent.

Nonincome-based taxes are estimated by VBARD.\n      \nG. Financial Sector Reforms and Institutional Development Efforts\n13. Though the pace of reforms in the financial sector could have been faster, progress was noted on\nall policy reform areas covered by the ADB-financed Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL).2  The World\nBank also indicated progress on the reform agenda under its projects.  Among the recent measures\ninitiated under the FSPL, the introduction of asset classification and provisioning norms3 and new chart\nof accounts4 will address the issues of portfolio quality, provisioning requirements, and transparency.\nSBV has also issued specific guidelines5 to ensure autonomy in lending decisions.\n14. On the institutional development side (i) VBARD\u2019s equity has been raised to $157 million in 1998,\n(ii)  accounts  are  being  audited  by  an  international  auditing  firm6  and  recommendations  introduced\ngradually, (iii) new credit regulations7 emphasizing in-depth credit appraisal have been issued, and (iv)\nchanges have been made in organization structure to create more specialization in product development.\nCredit appraisal skills are being enhanced under the ADB-financed Rural Credit Project and will be\ncontinued  under  the  Rural  Enterprise  Finance  Project,  as  well  as  the  technical  assistance  for\n                                                          \n2  Viet Nam: Loan 1485 (SF) \u2013 Financial Sector Program Loan: Aide Memoire of the Review Mission, 1999.\n3 State Bank of Viet Nam: No. 48/1998/Qd-NHNN5 dated 8 February 1999.\n4  State Bank of Viet Nam: No. 435/1998/Qd-NHNN5.\n5  State Bank of Viet Nam: No. 324/1998 dated 30 September 1998.\n6  PriceWaterhouseCoopers has audited the accounts of VBARD for FY1993 through FY1998.

Support for institutional development is also provided\nunder the ongoing projects funded by the World Bank.8\n15. The  institutional  development  agenda  for  VBARD  consists  of  (i)  corporate  governance;  (ii)\ninstituting a management information system (MIS) to serve the requirements for loan management,\ncredit  appraisal,  portfolio  analysis,  risk  management,  and  measurement  of  financial  performance\n(product  wise);  (iii)  product  development  (both  deposits  and  credit)  and  emphasis  on  savings\nmobilization;9 (iv) expediting the alignment of the current accounting system to international standards\nand integrating it with MIS; and (v) step up investment in training, particularly for enhancing technical and\nfinancial appraisal and accounting.  Improvements on the above aspects require substantial investments\nand VBARD may not be able to implement all of them immediately or even in the short term without\nexternal support.\n16. VBARD\u2019s capacity to implement the credit component under the project is considered adequate.\nVBARD  is  the  predominant  and  in  many  provinces,  the  only  formal  source  of  term  financing  for\nagriculture. VBARD\u2019s branch network and resource base enable it to cater to the heterogeneous demand\nfor financial services in the rural areas and give it a sufficient degree of decentralization of lending\noperations to facilitate credit delivery. It has traditional functional links with the extension agencies up to\nthe commune level. VBARD has exhibited a progressive approach by actively pursuing an institutional\ndevelopment agenda to enhance its financial soundness and competitiveness.

Legal Framework, Ownership, and Basic Objectives\n1. The People\u2019s Credit Fund (PCF) network was established in March 1993 (Decision No.\n390/Ttg of the Prime Minister) under the auspices of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) with the\nobjective  of  creating  a  strong  rural  credit  system  based  on  the  concept  of  self-managed\ncommunity-based banking. The PCFs are based on the Desjardine Credit Union model of Canada.\nA strong motivation behind the launch of the PCF system was to restore savers and investors\nconfidence that was lost when about 7,000 locally licensed cooperatives went bankrupt in 1990-\n1991. The PCF concept was shaped by and is still affected by lessons from that experience. The\nsystem comprises three tiers: PCFs, regional people\u2019s credit fund (RCFs), and central people\u2019s\ncredit fund (CCF), each an autonomous legal entity. PCFs are small-scale financial institutions\noperating in  the communes.  RCFs  operate  in  the  provinces,  providing  liquidity  and  technical\nsupport to member PCFs. CCF is the apex entity established in August 1995, operating in Hanoi\nand Ho Chi Min City and entrusted with the responsibility of providing overall funding, business,\nand technical support to the entire network. The PCFs, RCFs, and CCF are governed by the\nframework of the Law on Cooperatives, the Law on the SBV, the Law on Credit Institutions, Decree\nNo. 42/CP on PCF, and the Charter of CCF. They are subject to SBV\u2019s prudential guidelines and\ntheir annual accounts are audited by SBV. The PCF is a form of cooperative credit institution\norganized voluntarily by members of a community to mobilize savings and to provide credit and\nfinancial services for the primary objective of improving the economic and social well\u2013being of its\nmembers.  It is operated on the principles of cooperative self-help for mutual benefit, equal rights in\nmanagement, and share in profit; it is autonomous and self-governing. Under its charter, CCF is\nallowed autonomy to carry out commercial banking and development banking activities with the\nprimary objective of assisting and supporting the PCF system.\n2. During the six year (1993-1999) pilot phase, SBV played a pivotal role in organizing and\nensuring the PCF system\u2019s success in selecting communes with good business potential, licensing\nof PCFs, secondment of SBV staff to assist with PCF development, providing office space and\ncapital funds, and providing comprehensive training to PCF staff. CCF and RCFs are majority-\nowned by SBV.  As of 30 June 2000, the network comprises one CCF, 21 RCFs and 960 PCFs,\noperating in 53 (out of 61) provinces and  reaching about 10 percent of communes in the country. It\nis estimated that the PCF network presently provides about 4 percent of the outstanding credit in\nthe formal rural financial sector. In provinces where there are no RCFs, SBV branches (currently\n29) assume the role of RCF.  Equity capital consists of 2 classes of shares: qualifying share (for\nmembership) and permanent share (for dividend). Qualifying share for PCF costs D50,000 ($3.50),\nwhich has enabled even low income households to become members: and that for RCF and CCF\ncosts D10 million ($710).  The minimum paid-in capital of PCF is D100 million and that of RCF,\nD1.0 billion. The paid-in capital of CCF as of 30 June 2000 amounted to D110.9 billion, of which,\nD10.9 billion is subscribed by PCFs and RCFs, D 20 billion by the four State-owned commercial\nbanks (SOCBs) at D5 billion each, and the balance D80 billion by SBV. The combined paid-in\ncapital of RCFs and PCFs as of 30 June 2000 amounted to D22.2 billion and D165.7 billion,\nrespectively. As of 30 June 2000, PCFs have 765,490 members, CCF has 841 members, and\nRCFs have 4,068 members.\nB. Organization, Management, Staffing, and Training\n3. The management of CCF is under the overall supervision of a 5-member management\ncommittee  and  a  3-member  supervisory  committee  appointed  by  a  24-member  board  of\nmanagement who meet twice a year to discuss policy matters. The annual members\u2019 assembly\nappoints the board of management for a 4-year term. The president of the board of directors,", "47\nAppendix 4, page 2\ngeneral  director,  and  supervisor-in-chief  are  representatives  from  SBV.  A  management  team\ncomprising the general director and two deputy general directors in charge of nine functional\ndepartments of SBV carries out day\u2013to-day management. Figure A4 gives the organization chart of\nCCF. As of 31 August 2000, CCF had 120 staff, 102 at its head office in Hanoi and 18 at its\nbranch.  Eighty-five percent of the staff are university/college graduates and 90 percent are below\n40 years of age.  CCF has the following main functions: (i) handling and mediating fund in the\nwhole network; (ii) ensuring liquidity for the whole system; and (iii) liaising with the Government,\nSBV, credit institutions, and government and nongovernment organizations to ensure availability of\nlending resources. CCF provides loans to and receives deposits from PCFs through RCFs. In\nplaces where RCFs are not available, CCF lends and accept deposits via SBV branches. Interest\nrates are applied consistently all over the country.\nFigure A4: Organizational Chart of CCF\nBoard of Management Supervisory Unit\n(24 persons) (3)\nPolicy making Unit\n(5)\nGeneral Director &\n2 Deputy Directors\n(3)\nExternal \nInternal Credit  Consulting\nAccounting Cashier Planning Project Construction Administrative\nSupervisory (13) for PCFs\n(31) (5) (6) & IT (3) (21)\n(4) (2)\n(8)\nFund\nMobilizing\nUnits\nHCM City Branch\nHCM = Ho Chi Minh, PCF = People's Credit Funds\n4. Being a relatively new institution, CCF has not handled many international credit projects\nand therefore lacks experience. The linkage with PCFs needs strengthening and changes in\nsupervisors and managers involved in the execution of international credit projects should be kept\nto a minimum.  At CCF, a project implementation unit (PIU) has been established and staffed with\na team of full-time officers and provided with adequate resources to implement the Rural Credit\nProject. PIU staff have been trained in project management, accounting, and procurement by SBV.\nThey are considered as a strong asset of CCF to handle the Rural Enterprise Finance Project\n(REFP) and similar projects in the future.\n5. PCFs and RCFs now have about 7,000 staff. Their staffing structure is similar: members of\nthe board, a director, a deputy director, a supervisor, one or two credit officers, one accountant,\nand  one  cashier.    Most  management  staff  are  college  graduates  and  have  experience  in", "48\nAppendix 4, page 3\nmanagement, banking, and business. SBV requires all PCF staff to undergo compulsory training\nbefore the establishment of PCF. Training is conducted at SBV\u2019s Banking Institute or at provincial\nSBV branches and lasts from one to three months. Training courses cover banking and finance,\nlaw on banking, regulations and management of PCF, accounting and financial management,\ncredit  appraisal  of  projects,  and  internal  controls.  During  the  pilot  period,  training  was  fully\nsubsidized by SBV. Under the training program arranged by the Department of Credit Institutions\nof SBV for January 2000-June 2001, about 6,700 PCF staff will undergo training at an estimated\ntotal cost of D13 billion ($928,000) financed by dividends of SBV from the PCF system. Training\ncost in the past was partly funded by dividends and by a special budget from the Government.\nC. Operations\n1. Operating Policies and Procedures\n6. The basic policies to be observed by PCFs, RCFs, and CCF are prescribed in the Law on\nCooperatives, the Law on SBV, the Law on Credit Institutions, Decree 42/CP on PCF, the CCF\ncharter, and by SBV and the MOF.  The main financial policies are summarized as follows:   (i) give\npriority  to  financing  households  and  enterprises  in  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors  that  are\nengaged in food production and are labor-intensive; (ii) maintain minimum adequacy ratio of 8\npercent;  (iii)  maintain  minimum  liquidity  reserve  ratio  as  prescribed  by  SBV  and  maintain  a\nminimum current ratio of one; (iv) maintain a maximum ratio of 25 percent for short-term funds\nextended for medium- and long-term lending; (v) classify loan arrears and make prudent provision\nfor losses (Decision No.48); (vi) single-borrower limit shall not exceed 15 percent of net worth; (vii)\nadopt the chart of accounts issued by SBV, including accounting for loan interest income on\naccrual  basis;  (viii)  annual  financial  statements  will  be  audited  by  independent  auditors  from\nFY1999;  and  (ix)  comply  with  SBV\u2019s  regulation  on  remote  monitoring  of  cooperative  credit\ninstitutions  (No.  329/CV-TTR1).  These  policies  provide  generally  adequate  guidelines  for  the\noperations of the PCF system.\n2. Accounting, Audit, and Financial Controls\n7. The accounts of CCF, RCFs, and PCFs are maintained in accordance with the Vietnamese\naccounting standards (VAS) designed by SBV. Their annual accounts have been audited by SBV\nwithin three months after the year\u2019s closing. The accounting systems adopted by banks in Viet\nNam are reasonably uniform.  VAS for banks was recently revised to bring it much closer to\ninternationally accepted practice.  Interest is now required to be accounted for on an accrual basis,\nand assets with payment in arrears are required to be classified and prescribed provision for losses\nmade (Decision 48/1999/QD-NHNN5). The new chart of accounts, issued under Decision 435 by\nthe SBV, gives guidance on presenting balance sheets; however, there are still no other guidelines\nfor preparing and presenting other financial statements.  The skill of CCF, RCFs, and PCFs in this\narea is limited. The accounting system in CCF and RCFs is computerized. In PCFs, it is essentially\nmanually operated, with only a few PCFs using computers.  PCFs are subject to close supervision\nby SBV. An SBV branch conducts regular on-site inspection, and SBV head office inspectors carry\nout periodic inspection. Under Directive 329 on remote monitoring, PCFs are required to submit a\nmonthly report on loans, deposits, and loan arrears to SBV and RCF. To ensure quality loans, CCF\nadopts strict criteria in screening loan application by PCFs: (i) the PCF should be profitable in two\nconsecutive years; (ii) overdue debt should not exceed 5 percent of total loans; (iii) total lending to\nthe PCF will not exceed 70 percent of the PCF\u2019s outstanding loans; and (iv) mobilized deposit of\nthe PCF should constitute at least 30 percent of its total resources.", "49\nAppendix 4, page 4\n3. Past Operations and Financial Performance\n8. SBV made a comprehensive evaluation of the operations and performance of the PCF\nsystem in the pilot phase (1993-1999) at the end of 1999.  The study confirmed the overall success\nand  suitability  of  the  PCF  system  to  deliver  financial  services  to  rural  communities.  PCFs\nperformed an active financial intermediation function at the rural grassroots level and have given\nrural  borrowers  and  savers  access  to  financial  services,  made  available  loan  funds  to  rural\nborrowers at reasonable cost, successfully enforced and emphasized savings and credit discipline,\nemployed simple and practical procedures, and provided members a choice of savings and credit\nproducts.\n9.

Total resources of the PCF network grew at an average annual rate of 49.8 percent from\nD453.7 billion in 1995 to D2,286.1 billion (equivalent to $163.3 million) in 1999. Loan outstanding,\nwhich accounted for about 88 percent of total assets in 1999, registered strong growth of about 50\npercent a year from D396 billion (1995) to D2,004 billion (1999). Deposit mobilization grew strongly\nat 57 percent a year from D262 billion (1995) to D1,606 billion (1999), and as a source of funds\naccounted for about 58 to 71 percent of total resources and 66-80 percent of total loans during the\nperiod. This high growth rate is attributable to the proximity to rural households of the commune-\nlevel network of the PCF system and the higher interest offered by PCFs on deposits. This is made\npossible by the higher lending rate PCFs can charge their borrowers (up to 18 percent per annum)\ncompared with other banks.  It is also evident that the rural people have confidence in the PCF\nsystem, which is bolstered by the assurance that their deposits are insured. Other important\nsources of funds are shareholders\u2019 capital contribution and retained earnings, which accounted for", "50\nAppendix 4, page 5\n21  percent  of  total  resources;  and  borrowings  from  SBV  and  international  agencies  which\naccounted for about 7 percent of total resources in 1999.\n11. Since its establishment in 1993, the PCF network has been profitable, achieving a net\nincome of D16.1 billion (1995) to D65.6 billion (1999) or return on assets of between 3.2 percent\nand 6.0 percent.  In the past three years, return on equity was between 12.9 and 15.3 percent and\nthe operating ratio averaged about 80.4 percent, which is satisfactory. The capital adequacy ratio\nwas maintained at a satisfactory level of 22-43 percent during the period.  PCFs have been able to\nmaintain financial sustainability at a reasonable interest spread of 6-9 percent in the past four\nyears mainly because SBV has allowed the ceiling lending rate for PCFs to be as high as 1.5\npercent a month (despite numerous successive reductions in interest rate in the financial sector).\nPCFs are also allowed a preferential tax rate of 16 percent compared with a corporate tax rate of\n32 percent.  At the end of 1999, about 384,000 households benefited from loans granted by PCFs\ntotaling  D2,004 billion. Average loan size was D5.2 million ($370).  Most of the loans are short-\nterm (12 months and less), generally in line with the production cycle of agriculture. Loan purposes\nare diversified with 60 percent of the loans outstanding going to agriculture production, 28 percent\nto services, 12 percent to agroprocessing and traditional crafts and 3 percent to consumption.\nAverage loan sizes differ among the provinces with a wide range between D500,000 ($35) to D50\nmillion ($3,500). This reveals the great variety in socioeconomic status of PCF members. The PCF\nnetwork has a strong interest in lending to women and low-income households and has to develop\nnew products and methods to realize this interest. To date, female members account for 32\npercent  of  the  total  membership,  and  poor  members  account  for  about  20  percent  of  total\ncustomers. Because PCFs operate in communes, they understand clients well. The credit quality of\nPCFs is basically good with loan repayment rates higher than 96 percent. Most of the loans from\nPCFs are secured by collaterals like land or land use certificates.\n4. Management Information System (MIS) and Information Technology (IT)\n12. Under Directive 329/CV-TTR1 on Remote Monitoring, a reporting mechanism for the whole\nPCF network is now in place.  Staff at each PCF has a relatively good grasp of their PCF\u2019s financial\nposition. On a monthly basis, PCFs send, among others, reports on loans and deposit outstanding\nand loan arrears to the Banking Supervision Department of SBV provincial branches.  The reports\nare collated and sent to BSD of SBV head office. The SBV\u2019s Credit Cooperative Department\n(CCD), in coordination with the BSD, prepares and sends the necessary operating report to the\ngovernor and concerned agencies. For effective management of the whole network, it is necessary\nto develop an efficient MIS.  However, due to budgetary constraints, only about 11 percent of PCFs\nuse computers and development of an efficient MIS is constrained.\n5. Role of SBV\n13. The PCF system is a brainchild of SBV. SBV played a critical role in establishing and\ndeveloping the network. Two important departments overseeing its orderly development are CCD\nand the BSD. The CCD\u2019s major functions (with regard to PCFs) are summarized as follows: (i)\npromulgate and amend the legal framework governing the orderly and efficient development of the\nPCF system, (ii) issue licenses to PCFs, (iii) coordinate staff training of PCFs, (iv) develop the MIS\nof the PCF network, (v) coordinate with BSD on monitoring and supervising the PCFs, and (vi) be\nthe implementing agency for technical assistance (TA) projects from external agencies.\n14. BSD\u2019s major functions are to (i) regularly supervise PCF\u2019s compliance with prudential\nstandards and the laws and regulations governing PCFs, (ii) implement the remote monitoring\nsystem promulgated under Directive No. 329, (iii) investigate any dispute in PCFs and make\nrecommendations on its resolution to the governor, (iv) mete out sanctions on violation of law and", "51\nAppendix 4, page 6\nregulation, and (v) formulate and amend prudential standards with the objective of promoting\nefficient compliance.\n15. It is the express wish of SBV for CCF to progressively take over the direct management\nfunctions like inspection and internal audit, and the MIS for the whole PCF network, and CCD and\nBSD will carry out only their central banking role of supervision.  SBV realizes that for this to\nhappen, CCF will need to be adequately staffed with trained personnel. As such, responsibilities\nwill be handed over to CCF in a phased manner.\n6. Projected Operations and Financial Performance\n16. The comprehensive evaluation of the PCF system confirmed its overall success, but also\nhighlighted its weaknesses. Therefore, recommendations were made for its further strengthening\nand strategic growth. The major weaknesses are as follows. (i) Despite the commitment of SBV, its\nresources are unable to cope with the rapid growth of PCFs, resulting in close supervision being\ncompromised, as of June 2000, the license of about 28 PCFs have been withdrawn for reasons\nincluding poor management, undercapitalization, chronic loan arrears, poor deposit mobilization,\npoor location in areas with low business potential and some PCFs operated purely for profit instead\nof also embracing the social economic objective of the Government. (ii) Some PCFs encountered\nserious problems and risks by expanding too fast into neighboring commune. (iii) The physical and\nbusiness-supporting facilities of the PCFs are still relatively poor. (iv) The network is still not\nefficiently integrated, resulting in delays in providing support services to PCFs like emergency call\nfor funds and deposit of excess funds. (v) PCFs at commune level are still fledgling and vulnerable.\nFurther measures to ensure their security and long-term survival are necessary.\n17. For further strengthening and strategic growth of the PCF system, the comprehensive\nreview made these major recommendations: (i) 2000 will be the year for consolidating and further\nstrengthening  the  PCF  network;  no  new  PCF  will  be  established.  (ii)  The  legal  framework\ngoverning the operation of the PCF network will be further studied and improved to address the\nconcerns raised so far, e.g., clarification of the rights and features of qualifying and permanent\nshares, legal issues on foreclosure proceedings, and the legal status of RCF.  (iii) PCF should\noperate only within the confines of a commune. (iv) Strategic studies on the integrating model for\nthe PCF network should be carried out.  SBV has decided that a two-tier PCF system is more\nefficient than the present three-tier structure.  In this regard, CCF has been instructed to integrate\nRCFs into its operations within a reasonable time frame. CCF has submitted a corporate plan up to\n2001 to the Governor of SBV. In the plan, two new regional branches will be set up in Binh Dinh\nand Nghe An provinces, which will help in managing RCFs eventually converted into branches of\nCCF. SBV is now studying the cooperative bank model and the credit union model. (v) To expand\nits banking services, PCF can act as agent of a commercial bank for providing funds and banking\nservices. (vi) CCF will be empowered to manage the business operations of the entire network,\nwhich include managing liquidity and solvency, acting as clearinghouse for inter-PCF transactions,\ncarrying out internal inspection and supervision, managing the MIS, and reporting to SBV and\nconcerned agencies. (vii) A security fund is proposed to be set up with contributions from member\nPCFs.\n18.

The loan portfolio of the PCF system is expected to increase from D2,004 billion (FY1999)\nto D4,783 billion (FY2004) or an average of 19 percent a year.  Deposit mobilization is projected to\ngrow from D1,606 billion (FY1999) to D3,700 billion (FY2004), or average 18.2 percent a year.\nTotal assets are expected to increase from D2,286 billion (FY1999) to D5,266 (FY2004) or an\naverage  of  18.2  percent  a  year.  The  growth  of  assets  will  be  funded  mainly  from  deposit\nmobilization  (70  percent);  borrowings  from  other  banks,  international  agencies,  and  SBV  (13\npercent); capital contributions from members (8 percent); and accumulated earnings (11 percent).\n20. The financial projections of the PCF system were developed based on the assumption that\nthe current interest spread of about 7 percent will be maintained.  Profitability during the period is\nsatisfactory, with return on equity of between 9.6 and 12.2 percent. The capital adequacy ratio is\nexpected to remain comfortable at 19.4-21.9 percent. The operating ratio will remain satisfactory at\n83.5-86.7 percent, and the percentage of cumulative provision for loan loss to total loans is\nestimated at 2 percent.\n21.  Major assumptions for the financial projections for the PCFs are as follows:\n1. Balance Sheet\n(i)  Deposit growth is projected at average 18.2 percent a year.\n(ii)  Borrowings comprising borrowing from SBV, other banks, and international\nagencies are expected to increase at about 32 percent a year.\n(iii)  Capital contribution by PCF members is assumed to increase at about D20\nbillion a year.\n(iv)  Loans to customers are projected to grow at 19 percent a year.", "53\nAppendix 4, page 8\n(v)  Cash and deposits with SBV are estimated at 6.5 percent of deposits from\ncustomers.\n(vi)  Total assets growth is estimated at 18.2 percent a year.\n(vii)  Fixed assets are expected to increase at 20 percent a year.\n2. Income Statement\n(i)  Total interest income growth is estimated at 20.5 percent a year.  Interest\nincome on average loans is estimated at 18 percent a year.\n(ii)  The spread of interest income to average total loans and interest expense to\naverage total deposits is maintained at 7 percent a year.\n(iii)  Total interest expense growth is estimated at 19.6 percent. Interest expense\non average total deposits is estimated at 11 percent.\n(iv)  Administrative and other expenses are estimated to increase at 20 percent a\nyear.\n(v)  Corporate tax rate is at a preferential 16 percent.\nD. External Assistance\n22. PCFs are currently receiving TA from the Canadian International Development Agency\n(CIDA)  and  the  GTZ-DG  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit-Deutsche\nGenossenschaftsbank) Bank. CIDA has provided two TA projects to SBV. Under the first C$1.9\nmillion1 TA project (3/1993 \u2013 3/1997), the focus of the Desjardins Development International (DID)\nconsultants was to advise on the design and conceptual framework and the start\u2013up process of the\nPCF network. The second C$3.1 million TA project (1997-2000) focuses on consolidation and\nimplementation of the PCF system.  The emphasis is on resolving any institutional and operational\nissues and improving operational efficiencies. CIDA is now formulating its third TA project for\nassisting the network. This assistance may be in implementing the proposals made under its earlier\nTA for improving accounting, training, reporting, and the MIS. The GTZ is providing DM3.5 million2\nTA (1999-2001) to the network. An international consultant was fielded in March 2000 for the\nduration of the TA. The focus of the assistance is on the structural integration of the PCF network,\ntraining,  and  institutional  strengthening  through  improvement  in  operational  efficiencies.  The\nongoing assistance by CIDA and GTZ has been very useful to the PCF network.\n23. Under the Rural Credit Project, the CCF was provided a loan equivalent to $16.195 million\nfor two components: (i) a credit line for onlending to PCFs, and (ii) institutional strengthening. To\ndate, CCF has withdrawn $12 million (D150.694 billion) to finance 82,000 subprojects by PCFs. As\nof 31 December 1999, accumulated subloans under the project amounted to D768 billion. Despite\nmany obstacles, the credit to the poor component equivalent to $2 million has been implemented\nand 20,000 poor members have benefited so far.\n24. With funds provided by Agence Internationale pour la Francophonie (AIF), CCF has since\n1997 granted medium-term loans (3 years) to women who are owners of medium and small\nenterprises. Total funds supported by the agency aggregated to F650,0003 (over D1.4 billion).\nStatistics show that 500 new jobs have been created, of which 85 percent were for women. AIF\nintends to continue assistance for expanding the project in other areas.\n                                                \n1 At the exchange rate of $1 = C$1.38.\n2  At the exchange rate of $1 = DM1.73.\n3 At the exchange rate of $1 = F5.83.", "54\nAppendix 4, page 9\nTable A4.3: PCF System, Consolidated Income Statements, 1995 - 2004\nYear ending 31 December \n        (D billion)  \nActual Projected\nItem 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nInterest Income from loans 60.9 211.4 253.1 273.8 311.9 395.0 470.1 559.4 665.7 792.2\nInterest Income from deposits 4.9 6.6 0.0 2.3 3.4 5.7 6.2 7.3 8.7 10.2\nInterest Expense on deposit (31.5) (104.8) (123.0) (128.6) (155.1) (191.6) (226.3) (268.5) (317.6) (375.6)\nInterest Expense on borrowings (0.5) (3.5) (5.1) (9.3) (12.9) (11.8) (15.8) (21.1) (27.9) (36.8)\nNet Interest Income 33.8 109.7 125.0 138.2 147.3 197.3 234.1 277.1 328.9 390.0\nOther Income 0.3 0.8 3.7 6.5 35.2 35.0 35.0 35.0 35.0 35.0\nOperating Income 34.1 110.5 128.7 144.7 182.5 232.3 269.1 312.1 363.9 425.0\nGeneral Administrative Expenses (18.0) (60.1) (76.3) (89.4) (116.9) (140.3) (168.3) (202.0) (242.4) (290.9)\nProfit Before Losses on Loans 16.1 50.4 52.4 55.3 65.6 92.0 100.8 110.1 121.5 134.2\nLosses on Loans: Current Year  (23.8) (32.9) (10.8) (12.8) (15.3)\nProfit/(Loss) Before Taxation  16.1 50.4 52.4 55.3 65.6 68.2 67.9 99.4 108.7 118.9\nTaxation (10.9) (10.9) (15.9) (17.4) (19.0)\nNet Profit/(Loss) for the Year 16.1 50.4 52.4 55.3 65.6 57.3 57.0 83.5 91.3 99.9\nRetained Earnings & Reserves:\n   Beginning of year 5.3 21.4 71.8 124.2 153.3 180.8 238.1 295.1 378.5 469.8\n   Current year movements (26.20) (38.1)\n   End of year 21.4 71.8 124.2 153.3 180.8 238.1 295.1 378.5 469.8 569.7\nPCF = People's Credit Fund.\nSource: Central Credit Fund (CCF).\n Table A4.4: PCF System, Consolidated Balance Sheets, 1995 - 2004\nAs at 31 December\n(D billion)\nActual Projected\nItem 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nAssets\nCash and Notes 17.2 35.9 58.0 60.9 69.9 65.7 78.3 92.6 109.5 129.5\nDeposits with SBV & banks 26.7 13.3 26.8 9.0 58.6 56.4 67.1 79.3 93.9 111.0\nInvestments 3.0 10.7 17.8 37.1 43.2 43.2 43.2 43.2 43.2 43.2\nLoans to Customers 396.1 1,121.6 1,375.4 1,690.2 2,004.2 2,385.0 2,838.1 3,377.4 4,019.1 4,782.7\nFixed Assets 6.4 20.0 30.1 37.2 60.4 72.5 87.0 104.4 125.2 150.3\nOther Assets 4.3 11.1 26.4 23.3 49.8 49.8 49.8 49.8 49.8 49.8\n     Total Assets 453.7 1,212.6 1,534.5 1,857.7 2,286.1 2,672.6 3,163.5 3,746.7 4,440.7 5,266.5\nLiabilities  \nDeposit from Customers 261.9 862.0 1,012.7 1,212.0 1,605.8 1,878.4 2,236.4 2,644.9 3,129.0 3,699.9\nBorrowings 10.9 42.9 119.6 131.6 170.2 224.7 303.3 400.4 528.5 697.6\nOther Liabilities 4.1 11.8 14.5 43.7 27.5 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0\n     Total Liabilities 276.9 916.7 1,146.8 1,387.3 1,803.5 2,133.1 2,569.7 3,075.3 3,687.5 4,427.5\nCapital & Reserves\nCapital 155.4 224.1 263.5 317.1 301.8 319.9 339.1 359.4 381.0 403.9\nRetained earnings & Reserves 21.4 71.8 124.2 153.3 180.8 238.1 295.1 378.5 469.8 569.7\n    Owner's Equity 176.8 295.9 387.7 470.4 482.6 558.0 634.2 738.0 850.8 973.5\n     Total Liabilities and Equity  453.7 1,212.6 1,534.5 1,857.7 2,286.1 2,691.0 3,203.9 3,813.2 4,538.3 5,401.0\nPCF = People's Credit Fund, SBV = State Bank of Viet Nam.\nSource: Central People's Credit Fund (CCF). \nFinancial Ratios\nCapital Adequacy 25.4% 26.7% 26.3% 22.4% 21.9% 21.0% 20.6% 20.1% 19.4%\nCumulative Provision/ Loan Portfolio 1.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0%\nAverage Loans/Average Deposits 135.0% 133.2% 137.8% 131.1% 126.0% 126.9% 127.3% 128.1% 128.9%\nReturn on Av.

Economic Reform\n1. Economic reforms have been one of the most striking features of Viet Nam during the past\ndecade. Substantive market-oriented reforms since 1989, among others, have led to (i) liberalization\nof most price controls, (ii) significant reduction in subsidies and the State budget deficit, and (iii) the\ndecollectivization of agriculture.  A new constitution supporting the shift to a market system was\nadopted in 1992.  Important legal reforms were also undertaken, including the promulgation of the (i)\nLaw on Private Enterprises (1990); (ii) Law on Companies (1990); (iii) Land Law (1993) giving farmers\nland use rights; (iv) Labor Code (1994) protecting employer and employee rights and obligations; (v)\nBankruptcy Law establishing a legal framework for restructuring and liquidating insolvent enterprises;\n(vi) Civil Code (1995) that laid the legal foundation for market economy; (vii) Law on Cooperatives\n(1996); (viii) Law on State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) (1997); and (ix) Law on Credit Institutions (1997).\n2. The  reform  programs  have  substantially  restored  macroeconomic  stability,  permitting  an\naccelerated gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7-9 percent over the last seven years (1991-\n1998), and attracted public and private foreign capital. The fiscal deficit has been curbed and inflation\nhas declined from 394 percent in 1988 to under 8 percent in 1999. In the last five years, poverty has\ndeclined dramatically. Poverty in Viet Nam was 58 percent in 1993 and dropped to 37 percent in\n1998. The number below the food poverty line has also declined from 25 percent in 1993 to 15\npercent in 1998. In recent years, almost no other country has recorded a sharp decline in poverty in\nsuch a short period of time. Although poverty has declined, this situation is still very critical in rural\nareas. For the banking sector, this has translated into increased security of long-term investment and\npositive interest rates on savings. Predictably, both domestic savings and investment have picked up.\nGrowth in private sector investment and increases in employment accompanied this.\n3. The financial crisis in the region, however, significantly subdued the high growth rates and\nmade the economy susceptible to underlying policy weaknesses. Recognizing this, the Government\nplans to undertake further reform to encourage the growth and diversification of the private sector.\nSince the state sector continues to play the dominant role in resource allocation, sustainable and\nrapid economic growth still depends heavily on the quality of public sector investment and resource\nallocation.  The Government\u2019s priorities (for 1996-2000) as outlined by the Prime Minister in the\nNational Assembly, are to (i) increase the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy, (ii) intensify\nthe  reform  of  State-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  (iii)  modernize  and  streamline  the  financial  and\nbanking sector, (iv) ensure the social and environmental sustainability of economic growth, (v) deepen\npublic administration reform, and (vi) foster rural development and industrialization.\n4. In the banking sector, the remnants of the command economy mean that investment credit is\nvery scarce, banks have little experience in term lending and often feel unnecessarily exposed, and\ncredit  staff  in  the  State-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  after  years  of  lending  to  SOEs  are\nuntrained and unused to dealing with the private sector. The retraining of staff to equip them with the\nskills necessary to appraise and manage credits to private businesses is a priority for both Viet Nam\nBank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) and central people\u2019s credit fund-people\u2019s credit\nfunds.1 The products that suit micro, small and medium-scale businesses best - investment loans,\nequipment  leasing,  and  overdrafts  -  are  not  readily  available.  New  product  development  is  an\nimportant area for the banks.2 Recent relaxation of the collateral requirements by SBV so that land\nuse rights and assets purchased with loan proceeds can be used as collateral have given small\nborrowers access to term credit, but the new regulation needs to be brought into practice by the\n                                                \n1  Under the Project provision is made for extensive training for both VBARD and central people\u2019s credit fund-people\u2019s credit\nfunds in credit appraisal and micro and small business loan management.\n2  VBARD is being assisted with new product and service development under TA 3227-VIE:Strengthening Corporate\nGovernance at VBARD, for $900,000, approved on 19 July 1999.", "56\nAppendix 5, page 2\nbanks. Lending to SOEs continues to use a large amount of SOCB resources. Although VBARD has\nreduced the share of SOE lending from about 60 to about 30 percent of its outstanding portfolio over\nthe last five years, one-half of all new loans still go to SOEs, effectively rationing credit for the private\nsector.\nB. Poverty\n5. There are different measures of poverty, and according to each definition, Viet Nam has a\ndifferent poverty rate. For the Project the definitions of the World Bank and the Viet Nam General\nStatistical Office (GSO) are used. As defined, households on the food poverty line have per capita\nconsumption of less than 2,100 calories per day, but no allowance for essential nonfood expenditure.\nFood security was equal to $92 or D1,278,000 per year in 1998. A higher poverty line, which includes\nexpenditure for other essential nonfood needs, is equal to $128 or D1,790,000 per capita per year.\n6. The incidence of rural poverty (44.9 percent of the rural population) is five times that of urban\npoverty (9.0 percent). Over 90 percent of the poor are still in rural areas. Poverty has declined since\n1993, but the difference between urban and rural areas has increased (Table A5.1). In 1998, the\nhighest incidences of poverty were 59 percent in the northern uplands, 52 percent in the central\nhighlands and 48 percent in the north central coastal region (Table A5.2). The lowest incidence of\npoverty was in the South East at 8 percent. Since 1993, the Red River delta achieved the biggest\nreduction in poverty, and the Mekong River delta the lowest. Among the three poorest regions, the\nnorth central coast has seen the greatest reduction and the northern upland the least. Poverty is most\nprevalent in the uplands the northern mountains and the central highlands.\nTable A5.1: Poverty Head-Count Index in Viet Nam\nAll Viet Nam Urban Rural\nItem (%) (%) (%)\nFood poverty\n1993 24.9 7.9 29.1\n1998 15.0 2.3 18.3\nOverall poverty\n1993 58.1 25.1 66.4\n1998 37.4 9.0 44.9\nSource: GSO and WB estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, pp. 151-152\nTable A5.2: Poverty Head-Count Index in Different Regions of Viet Nam\nRegion 1993 1998 Decreased\n(%) (%) (%)\nNorthern Upland 79 59 20\nRed River Delta 63 29 34\nNorth Central 75 48 27\nCentral Coast 50 35 15\nCentral Highlands 70 52 18\nSouth East 33 8 25\nMekong Delta 47 37 10\nSource: GSO and WB estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, p. 14\n7. Most of the poor in 1998 were farmers (79 percent) or workers in agriculture. Falling poverty in\nViet Nam has been associated with falling poverty rates within each occupational category, rather\nthan shifts in occupational patterns (Table A5.3). The poor have relatively low levels of educational\nattainment, and lack functional skills and information. Ninety percent of the poor have had lower\nsecondary school or lower. The incidence of poverty is highest (57 percent) for those who have not", "57\nAppendix 5, page 3\neven completed primary education. By contrast, there is hardly any poverty among those with a\nuniversity degree (4 percent) (Table A5.4). Households with many children are often poorer. The\nnumber of children is highest in households in the poorest quintile (2.8 for the lowest quintile) and\ndrops as per capita expenditure rises. The poor have less access to material resources such as land,\ncredit; less access to social and physical infrastructure; are vulnerable to shocks\u2013illness, business\ncrisis and natural disaster\u2013and feel uncertain about their future. Three groups of poor households are\nespecially susceptible: ethnic minority groups, unregistered migrants in urban areas, and children.\nTable A5.3: Total Poverty in Different Occupations, 1998\nItem 1998\n(%)\nAgriculture 79\nManufacturing   9\nSales Services   3\nWhite collar   2\nOthers   0\nRetired   4\nOthers (not working)   3\nTotal 100\nSource: GSO and WB estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, p. 18.\n8. The doi moi (renovation) policies initiated in the late 1980s have led to rapid growth in GDP.\nBetween 1992 and 1998, agricultural GDP grew by 4.5 percent, industrial GDP by 13 percent, and\nGDP in the service sector by 8.3 percent. During this period, the main source of poverty reduction has\nbeen  from  agricultural  diversification.  On-farm  employment  has  grown  very  little  (the  share  of\nagricultural unemployment declined by 5 percent, from 71 percent to 66 percent), but agricultural\nincomes rose dramatically by 61 percent. The living standards of rural households have improved\ndramatically during this period. However, agriculture may not be able to grow as fast in the future.\nHence, off-farm employment and off-farm activities will need to play a relatively more important role in\npoverty reduction.\nTable A5.4: Share of Total Poverty in Different Education Levels in 1998\nMaximum Education 1998\n(%)\nNone 12\nPrimary 39\nLower Secondary 37\nUpper Secondary 8\nVocational 3\nUniversity 0\nTotal 100\nSource: GSO and WB estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, p. 20.\n9. To date, Viet Nam has yet to achieve dramatic growth in rural nonfarm employment. In 1993-\n1998, the percentage of rural households with at least one nonfarm enterprise remained stagnant at\naround 40 percent. The nonfarm enterprises of Viet Nam are still dominated by retailing and food\nprocessing, which accounted for 34 percent and 12 percent of all nonfarm rural enterprises in 1998.\nIncome from nonfarm enterprises grew by a solid 31 percent. As a result, household income derived\nfrom agriculture went from 37 to 47 percent, that from household non-enterprises remained more or\nless the same at about 19 percent, while that from wages and other sources declined from 44 to 34\npercent. There is enormous potential for non-farm enterprises to play a more prominent role in", "58\nAppendix 5, page 4\ngenerating employment and incomes for Viet Nam's future development to absorb much of the\nsurplus labor in agriculture. However, this sector faces capital shortage and resource management\ncapacity and skills.\n10. There has been an increase in inequality nation-wide between urban and rural areas, between\nregions, and within each region (Table A5.5).  Poor households often express a sense of alienation\nfrom decision-making processes and feel ill informed about government policies and programs. Often\nit is the better-off households who know more about government services and how to access them.\nPeople want to be consulted and question top-down policies, such as on compulsory taxes, fees, and\ncontributions. The Viet Nam Living Standard Survey (VLSS) data showed that the level and incidence\nof taxes, fees, and contributions vary significantly between regions and provinces (Table A5.6) giving\nrise to accusations of lack of transparency and accountability in the way that taxes and fees are\ncollected and spent.\n11. Although there is a mechanism to feed information down to the village level, this does not\nalways work well. In many cases, the processes in place do not allow the poor households to\ncommunicate their concerns and priorities back up through the system. However, the Government\nhas  recognized  the  need  for  reorienting  Government  planning  supporting  and  complementing\nindividual involvement in economic decision making at the grassroot level. Toward this end the\nGrassroots Democracy Decree (Decree No. 29, issued in May 1998) is an initiative that provides an\nopportunity to improve the transparency of local government operation and to provide households with\nmore information about local government activities and finances.  Nevertheless, the decree is still in\nthe early stages of implementation.\nTable A5.5: Decomposition of Inequality by Region (their L Index of Inequality, 1993-1998)\n1993 1998 Absolute Change Between\n1998 and 1993\nTotal inequality in Viet Nam 0.177 0.201 + 0.024\nof which (100%) (100%) (100%)\nInequality between regions 0.026 0.046 + 0.020\n(15%) (23%) (83%)\nInequality within regions 0.151 0.155 + 0.001\n(85%) (77%) (17%)\nSource: World Bank estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, p. 69.\nTable A5.6: Level and Incidence of Taxes, Fees and Contributions (TFC)\nPaid by Rural Households in 1998\nTFC TFC as  percent of household\nLocation (D\u2019000 per household) expenditure\nAll Vietnam 473\nNorthern Upland 329 3.8\nRed River Delta 563 6.6\nNorth Central 436 5.4\nCentral Coast 543 4.9\nCentral Highlands 399 3.4\nSouth East 453 2.6\nMekong Delta 518 4.3\nSource: World Bank estimation based on VLSS93 and VLSS98, in WB, 1999, p. 92.", "59\nAppendix 5, page 5\n12. Rural households have limited access to reliable facilities for saving, which could be withdrawn\nin times of hardship or peak expenditure. This limits the ability of poor households to cope with\nshocks. Public safety nets and targeted programs to help the poor have been implemented in Viet\nNam. The Government's Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction (HEPR) program provides a\nframework to address some of the most pressing needs of poor households. However, it is not yet\nclear what impact these policies and programs have had on the poor.\n13. Although Viet Nam has made considerable progress in reducing poverty in the last five years,\npoverty remains widespread and deep. Labor is commonly regarded as the poor's most abundant\nasset. To raise the living standards of the able-bodied poor, it is essential to provide them with the\nopportunities for productive and remunerative employment. Hence, the three engines of growth-\nagricultural growth and diversification, rural off-farm employment, and urban employment - that have\nled to poverty reduction during 1993-1998 should continue to become the engines of growth in the\ncoming years. Stimulating off-farm employment and urban employment growth is a major challenge\nand will require a host of reforms, including equal opportunities with the State sector, removing\nconstraints  to  capital  access,  establishing  a  reliable  legal  framework,  and  providing  supporting\ninfrastructure. Ensuring that agricultural development contributes fully to rural income growth and\npoverty reduction in the future requires a number of key actions: (i) reforms to further liberalize the\nagriculture sector should be continued and deepened; (ii) Viet Nam\u2019s land law needs to be fully\nimplemented; (iii) rural finance needs to be overhauled in the context of overall banking reform; (iv)\ninvestments need to focus on rural infrastructure; (v) agricultural research and extension system to\nhelp  farmers  should  be  focused,  client-oriented,  and  better  allocated,  with  the  private  sector\nencouraged to play a role in this field; and (vi) water resource should be well managed and efficient.\nC. Promoting Rural Enterprise\n14. The Project focuses on providing assistance to the nonfarm business activities of micro and\nsmall businesses including non-SOEs, cooperatives, registered household enterprises, and other\nhousehold businesses that are not registered in rural areas. There is no official definition of micro and\nsmall enterprises (MSE) in Viet Nam. Under decision No. 681/CP-KTN of 20 June 1998, a small and\nmedium-scale enterprise (SME) is defined as an incorporated enterprise with less than D5 billion in\ncapital and employing less than 200 persons. For the purposes of the Project, micro enterprises are\ndefined as businesses typically having less than five employees and small enterprises are defined as\ntypically having less than 50 employees. Nonfarm businesses are businesses that are not concerned\nwith  primary  agricultural,  livestock,  and  forestry  production.  Non-SOEs  comprise  joint-stock\ncompanies, limited-liability companies, and sole proprietorships incorporated under the Companies\nLaw and the Law on Private Enterprises and approved by the relevant Provincial People\u2019s Committee\nor higher level authority. A cooperative is an enterprise incorporated under the Law on Co-operatives.\nHousehold enterprises are predominantly nonfarm business under a business licence granted by the\nDistrict People\u2019s Committee in accordance with Decree 66-HDBT of 1992.  Household businesses are\nnonfarm businesses that are not registered as part of households\u2019 overall farm and nonfarm activities.\nRural areas are defined as areas outside the municipal boundaries of major cities. Collectively, the\nbusinesses to be supported under the project are referred to as rural nonfarm businesses.\n15. The private sector has grown rapidly from a negligible base since the promulgation in 1991 of\nthe Law on Private Enterprises and the Law on Companies. In 1999 there were 386 joint-stock\ncompanies, 11,742 limited-liability companies, and 26,338 registered household businesses. The\ncooperative sector collapsed in the early 1990s, with numbers falling from nearly 43,000 in 1989 to\nonly  1,876  in  1995.  Subsequently  there  has  been  some  revival  and  in  1998  there  were  4,259\nnonagricultural cooperatives. The most recent estimate of the number of unregistered household\nbusinesses is 2.22 million in 1996.3 The number of SOEs fell from about 12,000 in 1990 to about\n                                                \n3  Source:  Master\u2019s Program in Development Economics, Development Economics Group, 2000.  An Overview of SMEs in\nViet Nam.", "60\nAppendix 5, page 6\n6,800 in 1999.  In terms of the capital criteria of the official definition of SMEs, about 89.5 percent of\nthe registered enterprises in Viet Nam are classified as small (i.e., capital of less than D4 billion or\n$70,000). Some 96 percent have less than 200 employees. Strong growth in the household registered\nbusiness sector and continued steady growth in the number of limited companies can be expected\nprovided that the policy environment is conducive and fair to the conduct of private business.\n16. Credit alone is insufficient to foster strong and sustainable growth in the private sector in a\ntransitional economy. Businesses need access to a range of support services such as facilitation\nservices  for  business  idea  generation,  diagnostic  reviews,  credit  facilitation,  advertising  and\npromotion, work placement and labor mobility schemes, and lobbying to create a better operating\nenvironment;  information  services  to  provide  internet  access,  information  on  markets  and\ntechnologies, dissemination of basic materials on MSE business management, promotion of local\nproducts; training services on relevant legislation, how to start a business, how to incorporate a\nbusiness,  how  to  apply  for  credit,  importing  and  exporting,  sales  and  marketing  skills,  financial\nmanagement  skills,  and  people  management  skills,  training  for  business  advisers,  training  for\nbusiness trainers; linkages such as the stimulation of business clubs and associations, providing\nsignposting for MSEs to access other information and services not provided by the rural business\ncenters (RBCs), networking to suppliers and buyers and other business clubs; and promotion of\nMSEs through the media, events, competitions, and obtaining further funding support.\n17. The research shows that these types of services are most sustainable when provided by the\nprivate sector or through public-private partnerships, and where there is competition for funding.4 The\nProject will begin to address the support service constraints through the establishment of RBCs or\nrural business associations guided by these principles.\n                                                \n4  Tanburn J, 1999.

Objectives, Scope, and Rationale\n1. The Rural Credit Project (RCP)1 was to strengthen the Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and\nRural Development (VBARD) and the People\u2019s Credit Fund (PCF) and supplementing their medium-\nand long-term resources in financing viable small- and medium-scale agriculture-related enterprises\nfor which there was a large potential in the rural areas. The objectives were to (i) increase the income\nof rural people and expand productive employment by providing short- and medium- term credit to the\nrural sector; and (ii) strengthen the rural financial system, thereby improving financial services to the\nrural sector. As envisaged, the RCP was implemented throughout the country except in urbanized\nprovinces. It comprised three components: (i) a credit line ($43 million) to VBARD ($29.4 million) and\nthe Central People\u2019s Credit Fund (CCF) ($13.6 million); (ii) strengthening of financial institutions ($2.0\nmillion). VBARD ($0.69 million), PCFs ($0.96 million), and International Credit Project Management\nUnit (ICPMU) ($0.35 million); and (iii) strengthening project management of ICPMU of the State Bank\nof Viet Nam (SBV) ($0.94 million). The financial institutions were strengthened through training and\nsupport facilities financed from the loan. In addition to the institutional strengthening component under\nthe Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided VBARD with technical assistance in 1999 to\nstrengthen its corporate governance.2\nB.   Cost, Financing and Implementation Status\n2. The total cost of the RCP was estimated at $75.8 million equivalent, of which $25 million was\nthe foreign exchange cost and $50.8 million equivalent the local currency cost. ADB\u2019s loan of $50\nmillion from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources was to finance all the foreign exchange\ncost equivalent to 33 percent of the total cost and 49 percent of the local cost equivalent to 33 percent\nof the total cost, while the participating financial institutions and the subborrowers were to finance all\n51 percent of the local currency cost and 34 percent of the total cost, respectively.\n3. Implementation of the RCP commenced after the loan became effective in April 1997.  It was\nexpected that the RCP would provide subloans for about 100,000 subprojects and that the loan would\nbe committed within three years and disbursed within four years of loan effectiveness. As of 29\nFebruary 2000, the RCP had provided subloans for a total of 124,500 subprojects and disbursement\nunder the loan stood at $43 million. The commitments and disbursements exceeded the expectations\nat appraisal and only $2 million3 remained to be disbursed for institutional strengthening. It was\nexpected that the loan will be fully disbursed by end of 2000.\n4. The RCP was implemented in line with the arrangements envisaged at appraisal. The loan\ncovenants were generally well conceived and appropriate. In particular, the covenant requiring a\nrepayment performance of at least 80 percent ensured that VBARD and the PCFs took care in\nselecting subborrowers and subprojects. To date, the level of compliance with covenants by VBARD\nand the PCFs has been fairly satisfactory. Particularly noteworthy are the 1997 and 1998 recovery\nrates of over 95 percent. The reported recovery rate for 1999 is 98 percent. The allocation of $2\nmillion for lending to the poor by PCFs was delayed and only implemented in 1999. The prescribed\nsubloan size of $20 to $100 made it unattractive to PCFs to lend and was also too small for the poor.\nThe loan covenant, which specifies a lending rate from Government to the PFIs of at least ADB\u2019s rate\nfor OCR was inappropriate and would have immobilized the Project if early actions to rationalize it\nwere not taken by the Government. The current rate is based on the weighted average cost of deposit\n                                                          \n1  Loan 1457-VIE(SF), for $50 million, approved on 12 September 1996.\n2  TA 3227-VIE: Strengthening Corporate Governance at VBARD, for $900,000, approved on 19 July 1999.\n3  The loan was equivalent to $45 million as of 29 February 2000.", "                                                      6  3                                                Appendix 7, page 2 \nfunds of the financial system determined every quarter or as frequently as SBV feels it is necessary.\nAlso inappropriate was the requirement that the participating financial institutions (PFIs) have to\nborrow funds at commercial rates to finance institutional strengthening. These loan conditions partly\ncaused the delay in implementing the component and was resolved when the Government, PMU and\nPFIs  agreed  that  loan  funds  would  be  provided  at  ADB\u2019s  ADF  rate.  Some  delays  occurred  in\nimplementing  environment-related  aspects  of  the  subprojects.  Although  VBARD  and  the  PCFs\nintegrated environmental considerations in their subloan appraisals, the appreciation of environment\nsafeguards and actual implementation by subborrowers is, in many cases, still lacking. The PFIs are\nnow working to overcome these deficiencies. It has also been noted that the high demand for rural\nenterprise financing has put undue pressure on VBARD and the PCFs field appraisal staff. Each staff\nmember manages more than 800 subloans (including those for nonproject credit), resulting in weak\nsupervision of subloans. However, such weak supervision has not affected repayment performance\nbecause  the  PFIs  (especially  VBARD)  have  a  system  of  performance-based  remuneration  that\npenalizes staff who fail to meet the target for subloan recovery. This policy is unfair to the staff and\nVBARD is currently reviewing it. With the expansion in project lending, the PFIs have to rationalize the\nworkload  of  field  staff  in  the  interest  of  ensuring  sufficient  supervision  of  subprojects  and\nsubborrowers\u2019 compliance with applicable loan covenants.\nC.  Preliminary Evaluation of Initial Performance\n1. Overall Lending\n5. A comprehensive midterm review of the RCP was carried out jointly by SBV, VBARD, CCF,\nand ADB in year 3 of implementation. A domestic consultant firm was recruited to undertake a\nsocioeconomic survey and to evaluate the implementation of the RCP. The consultant used the\nparticipatory rural assessment (PRA) approach and supported it with secondary data review. Under\nthe  PRA,  a  sample  of  1,380  households  (900  households  were  borrowers  and  480  were\nnonborrowers). These households were randomly selected in 15 provinces on the basis of several\ncriteria,  among  them,  outstanding  loans  (high  and  low),  regional  representation,  geographic\nrepresentation (highland and lowland), presence of PFI branches. Fifteen VBARD branches and 15\nPCFs in these 15 provinces were then randomly selected.\n6. The survey found that (i) impact on PFIs is positive, especially in respect of promoting a more\nbalanced source and application of term resources, adoption of international practices in finance and\nbanking,  a  better  appreciation  of  the  concepts  of  sustainability  as  it  relates  to  profitability  and\nenvironment; (ii) economic impact on subborrowers is significant, including better access to term loan\nfunds,  diversification  of  income-generating  activities  from  farm  to  off-farm  rural  enterprises,  and\nincreased income; (iii) social impacts on beneficiaries are also significant, comprising, among others,\na  greater  awareness  of  environmental  impacts,  reduction  of  borrowing  from  money-lenders  and\nmiddlemen, improved credit literacy, increased participation of social organization and local people\u2019s\ncommittees in lending decisions of PFIs and in recovery of loans, and increased sensitivity to gender\nissues and education.\n2. Lending under the Rural Credit Project\n7. The distribution of subloans made under the RCP is shown in Tables A7.1 and A7.2. By 29\nFebruary 2000, VBARD and the PCFs had extended 120,051 subloans for a total value of D727,409\nbillion, with an average loan size of D5.5 million. In the case of VBARD, 43.6 percent of subloans\nwere made in the northern upland, 7.7 percent to the Red River delta, 21.5 percent to the north-\ncentral region, 4.8 percent to the central coast, 3.4 percent to the central highlands, 5.5 percent to the\nsoutheast, and 13.5 percent to the Mekong River delta.", "64\n                                                                                                        Appendix 7, page 3 \nTable A7.1:  Status of Utilization of VBARD's\nCredit Facilities, by Sector\n(as of 15 February 2000)\nNo. of Amount Disbursed by ADB\nSector Subloans %\nDong $ Equivalent\n1.

The data in the tables indicate that subloans were made for various purposes. In total, 52\npercent (77.5 percent by number) went to capital investments in agricultural production activities,\nlivestock, and aquaculture, while the rest were for agroprocessing and support services. Comparatively,\nVBARD made more loans for crop production, livestock, and aquaculture (86 percent by amount), while\nPCFs made only 59 percent of total loans by amount to these sectors.  PCFs made more loans for\nagroprocessing and support services.\n9. In terms of socioeconomic characteristics, subborrowers were from low-income groups. The\naverage household size was 5.2, of which an average of 3.2 were in the work force. VBARD and PCFs\nsubborrowers were mainly low-income clients with more than 70 percent having an annual income of\nless than D2 million. Eighty percent had a main income from agriculture or aquaculture, while the rest\nearned their main income from services and other agriculture-related activities. The subloans made\nranged  from  D500,000  to  D7  million  and  averaged  D6  million.  More  than  85  percent  of  the\nsubborrowers were between 25 and 50 years old; 90 percent had gone beyond primary education, with\n65 percent finishing secondary or vocational schooling. About 7 percent of respondents hired labor\nwhile 30 percent hired as well as maximized use of family labor, and 60 percent used only family labor.\nEighty-five percent of hired labor was women. On average, one full job was created for a subloan\ninvestment of $650. Seventy percent of the respondents reported that the decision to borrow was a\nfamily decision, while 5 percent said that the wife made the decision. In 100 percent of the cases, both\nhusband and wife signed the loan application.  More than 60 percent of the respondents were new\nborrowers of VBARD or PCFs. They either have not borrowed before or have been borrowing from\nmoneylenders, relatives, and friends.

Credit Models\n2. Sixteen of these model businesses covering the whole of the investment range were chosen\nfor more detailed analysis. A summary of the results is presented in Table A9.2. The analyzed\nsubprojects have cost-benefit ratios at a 12 percent discount rate ranging from 1.04 to 1.29, and\nfinancial internal rates of return of between 14 and 56 percent. The sensitivity analysis on reduction in\nsales prices and increases in costs shows that all businesses can withstand 5 percent cost increases\nor 5 percent sales price reductions, and the majority of the subprojects remained viable with 10\npercent cost increases or 10 percent sales reductions. The exceptions are subprojects that process\ncommodities in bulk or rely on volume output and are  characterized by low value added. However,\nsuch businesses are normally able to adjust to price changes with the market, and can be expected to\nmaintain their viability.\n3. The  subproject  analyses  use  a  standardized  set  of  assumptions  to  make  subprojects\ncomparable. The project life is taken as the life of the main investment asset. Capital costs are\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the assets involved, and residual values added\nback to the cash flow in the last year. Working capital is taken as a proportion of operating costs\nbefore taxes, varying from one week to six months depending on the nature of the project and the\nresources that are tied up in production at one time. Labor is priced at D10,000 per day for unskilled\nworkers, D20,000 to D25,000 per day for skilled workers, depending on the skill level required. Taxes\nare calculated at a standard 32 percent of profit before tax. Foreign exchange percentages are based\non the cost of imported items or imported components adjusted for local margins and sales taxes and\na component of the working capital for items in operating costs that are imported.\n4. Analysis of the models shows an average foreign exchange cost of 45 percent for the range of\nsubprojects that will be financed by VBARD and 40 percent for subprojects that will be financed by\nPCFs.\nC.  Employment Creation and Income Generation\n5. Analysis of employment creation shows that subprojects on average will create 2.91 full-time\njob equivalents while those requiring subloans of less than $10,000 will create 1.95 jobs on average.\nHowever,  these  figures  are  inflated  by  the  inclusion  of  four  subprojects  with  unusually  high\nemployment potential (furniture production, rice cake manufacture and roof tile manufacture). When\nthese projects are removed from the analysis, the average employment creation effects are 1.8 full-\ntime  equivalent  jobs  for  all  subprojects  and  1.3  full-time  equivalent  jobs  for  subloans  less  than\n$10,000. These more conservative figures are used in the estimation of employment generation. It is\nexpected that about 32,900 subloans by PCFs of less than $10,000 will create about 51,900 jobs and\nabout 38,400 subloans by VBARD will create about a further 49,800 jobs, bringing the total to about\n101,700 new jobs of which about 73,100 will be in low-income households and 20,200 in micro\nbusinesses.\n6. For all projects, the average cost per job created is $3,840 and for investment requiring\nsubloans of less than $10,000 is $996. Removing the high employment generation activities from the\nanalysis, the average cost per job created is $6,785 for all subprojects, and for subprojects needing\nsubloans of less than $10,000 it is $2,118 (Table A9.2).", "6\n8\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n9\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n3", "69\nAppendix 9, page 4\n7. Analysis of income generation shows that subprojects have substantial potential to increase\nincomes.  The  net  annual  income  increases  for  the  subprojects  analyzed  vary  from  $92  for  the\nsmallest business with an investment cost of $223 to $10,731 for the largest business with an\ninvestment of $51,429. The average annual return on capital for all subprojects is estimated at 28\npercent. The average annual return on capital for subprojects requiring subloans below $10,000 is\nestimated at 25 percent.\nD. Other Project Costs - Institutional Strengthening Component\n8.

Credit Supply and Demand\n1. VBARD\n11. In 1999, VBARD provided new credits to about 3.1 million households to a total value of\nD17,849 billion (about $1.275 billion) with an average loan size of D5.8 million ($414). Of these loans\nabout 2.4 million were of short-term duration of less than 12 months with a total value of D13,872\nbillion (about $991 million) and 0.7 million were term loans with maturities between 12 and 60 months\nand a total value of D3,977 billion (about $284 million).\n12. In the rural industry and services sector, VBARD made about 123,800 short-term loans to a\nvalue of D1,477 billion ($105 million), of which about 80 percent (D1,193 billion  or $85 million) was for\nservices and trade and about 20 percent (D284 billion or $20 million) was for rural industry. The\naverage loan size was D11.9 million ($852). For nonagricultural purposes, VBARD also made about\n22,000 term loans for a total of D173 billion ($12.4 million). Of this about 60 percent (D104 billion or\n$7.4 million) was for services and trade and about 40 percent (D69 billion or $5 million) was for rural\nindustries. The average loan size was D7.9 million ($564).\n13. VBARD\u2019s lending to cooperatives for rural industry and services was negligible in 1999. It\nmade a total of about 8,200 new loans to registered private sector enterprises for a total value of\nD1,043 billion or $74.5 million of which about 5,500 loans (D896 billion or $64 million) with an average", "71\nAppendix 9, page 6\nvalue of D160 million or about $11,500 were short-term and about 2,700 loans (D147 billion or $10.5\nmillion) with an average value of $3,885 were long-term.\n14. Overall in 1999, VBARD provided about $22.9 million in new term credit for rural industry and\ntrade and services, and a further $169 million in new short-term credit in these sectors. Total new lending\nwas $191.9 million. VBARD has increased its term lending progressively from 23 percent of its portfolio\nin 1995 to 39 percent in 1999 and has gained substantial experience in term lending over this period.\nAbout 26 percent (D2,004 billion or $143 million) of the total outstanding term loans of D7,845 billion\n($560 million) was funded from external credit lines at the end of 1999.\n2.  PCFs\n16. In 1999, PCFs provided credit to about 746,000 households to a total value of D3,617 billion\n(about $258 million) with an average loan size of D4.8 million ($343). About 150,000 of these households\nare poor households. Most PCF loans are short-term loans of 1-10 months duration with an average\nmaturity of 3-6 months. The portfolio is diversified. In 1999, 57 percent of lending was for agricultural\nactivities (about D2,062 billion or $147 million), 28 percent for services and trade (about D1,013 billion or\n$72 million), 12 percent for rural industries (about D434 billion or $31 million), and the remaining 3\npercent for consumption purposes (about D108 billion of $8 million). The total lending for agroprocessing\nand other rural businesses excluding farming is estimated to have been about D1,447 billion ($103\nmillion) in 1999. PCFs have been reluctant to give term credit until now because of a shortage of term\ndeposits and a desire to have matched maturities.\n3.  Demand\n17. For the industry sector, World Bank projections1 of gross domestic product (GDP) estimate a\nminimum of 5.8 percent growth in 2000, 9 percent in 2001, and 8.8 percent in 2002, 2.7 percent in the\nservice sector in 2000. For the service sector the projections are 2.7 percent in 2000, 5.1 in 2001 and 4.9\nin 2002. If VBARD and PCFs respond only to the increases in demand that will result from projected\nGDP growth, then the new lending would be $634.5 million for VBARD and $340.6 million for PCFs over\nthis period. The proposed ADB credit lines of about $35 million for VBARD and $10 million for PCFs\nwould provide 5.5 and 2.9 percent, respectively, of this lending.\n18. However, not only is it likely that the private sector will continue to grow in relative terms, fueled in\npart by the equitization and privatization of state-owned enterprises, but there is strong evidence that the\neffective demand for loan capital from micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises is unsatisfied, offering\ngreater potential for VBARD and PCFs to expand their lending, particularly for term loans. Recent studies\nshow that the largest constraint to private enterprise development in Viet Nam is that of term capital. 2\nAware of this, both VBARD and CCF-PCF wish to develop long-term financing. In VBARD\u2019s case, the\nproportion of term financing in the portfolio can be expected to continue to grow, but less rapidly than in\nthe last five years; in the case of PCFs, rapid growth can be expected with the first availability to them of\nfunds for term lending to nonfarm businesses under the ADB loan.\n                                                \n1\n  World Bank. 1999. Vietnam, Preparing for Take-off? Hanoi.\n2\n  Nomura Research Institute (1999) in Study on the Promotion of Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises in Viet Nam from a\nsurvey of SMEs reports that loans to SMEs are nearly always restricted to short-term credit for working capital and medium-\nterm funds are very scarce and difficult to access. The Stockholm School of Economics (1998) in Anatomy and Dynamics of\nSmall-scale Private Manufacturing in Viet Nam studied over 500 enterprises and found funding shortage was the most\nserious  constraint  to  growth  in  these  enterprises.  The  Mekong  Project  Development  Facility  (1999)  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s\nUndersized Engine: a Survey of 95 Larger Private Manufacturers (with less than 100 employees) found that 53 percent\ncited difficulty In reply to: accessing investment capital as a major constraint to their development, while 39 percent said\nworking capital access was also a major difficulty. CIEM-UNIDO (1998) in Improving the Macroeconomic Policy and\nReforming the Administrative Procedures to Promote the Development the Small and Medium Enterprises in Viet Nam\nfound that 55 percent of enterprises had difficulty in accessing investment and working capital.", "IMPLEMENTATION  SCHEDULE\nYEAR 1 YEAR 2 YEAR 3 YEAR 4 YEAR 5 YEAR 6\n Item\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\nA.
