This is the second nonsovereign \nloan to the leasing sector in Viet Nam.1\n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Viet Nam\u2019s Economy \n1.  Overview and Outlook \n2.  Viet Nam has maintained rapid economic growth over the past decade as the country \nhas continued its transition from a command economy into one increasingly based on market \nmechanisms. The economy has grown at almost 7% per annum since 2000, with an average \nannual growth rate of 8% in 2003\u20132007 from strong export growth, foreign direct investment, \nand remittances\u2014all factors that have facilitated growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita from $441 in 2002 to $818 in 2007. GDP at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 \nto $2,587 over this period.2  Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007 \nhas further committed the country to ongoing liberalization and economic reforms as well as the \nsustained development of the private sector. Over the 1995\u20132006 period, the private sector\u2019s \nshare of GDP rose from 14% to 23%, and its share of industrial production grew from 31% to \n56%.3\n \n3.  However, in recent years, internal and external imbalances, combined with sluggish \npolicy response, have contributed to the April\u2013August 2008 inflationary spike. Expansionary \nmonetary and fiscal policy fuelled credit growth, which rose to an annualized 43% in March \n2008 and contributed to a rise in inflation, which reached 21.4% in April,4 25.2% in May, and \n26.7% in October.  Other major factors contributing to inflation were the rise in international \ncommodity prices, particularly refined petroleum, of which Viet Nam is a net importer; increased \nwages in the skilled labor market; escalating property prices; and the rise in domestic food \nprices. Food products and services account for 43% of the consumer price index; in October \n2008, prices were 40.7% higher than in October 2007 because of such supply-side shocks of \ncrop failure and livestock and poultry epidemics5 and consumers\u2019 hoarding of rice in April\u2013May \n2008.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  indicated  that  the  Government  needs  to \nmaintain inflation targeting and focus on lowering the trade deficit at the expense of short-term \ngrowth. The Asian Development Outlook of ADB has revised the country\u2019s growth rate to 6.5% \nfrom 7% in 2008 and adjusted its forecast down to 6% for 2009 from the previous estimate of \n8.1%.   \n \n4.  In the external sector, the current account deficit widened because of ongoing large-\nscale  investments  and  related  capital  goods  imports  by  the  public  sector,  higher  priced \ncommodity imports including gold, and a recent surge of precautionary imports in response to \n                                                 \n1 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved on 11 December 2007 the first nonsovereign loan, $20 million to Vietcombank \nfor onlending to its leasing subsidiary.  \n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Viet Nam\u2019s New Challenges amid Overheating.  \n5  ADB. 2008. Viet Nam Country Chapter. Asian Development Outlook 2008 Update. Manila (17 September). \n ", "2   \nthe Government\u2019s announcement of import taxes on cars and motorcycles.6  Despite strong \nexports, the external current account deficit moved from 9.6% of GDP in 2007 to an estimated \n25% of GDP in January\u2013June 2008. Overall, investor sentiment remained mostly positive as \nindicated by net foreign direct investment inflows, which reached $6.6 billion in 2007 and are \nestimated at $5 billion for the first 6 months of 2008. Thus, the overall balance of payments \nreached a surplus in 2007 and a small deficit in the first 6 months of 2008. As a result of foreign \ndirect investment inflows and a rise in portfolio investment, official reserves have increased from \n$11.5 billion at end-2006 to an estimated $21 billion at end-2007, standing at an estimated $20 \nbillion as of end-June 2008. \n \n5.  Concerns over the recent inflationary spike resulted in the downgrading by Fitch Ratings \nin May 2008 of Viet Nam\u2019s country outlook from stable to negative. The rating agency has \nindicated that the Government\u2019s response has been both too slow, with official positions not \nfollowed up by immediate action, and too small, with real interest rates remaining negative \nfollowing the recent increase. Fitch notes, however, that the authorities have recently become \nmore willing to take action to urgently control inflation and strengthen market-oriented macro-\nmanagement tools. This includes a tighter monitoring policy, strict regulations on bank capital \nadequacy with a ceiling on bank lending growth of 30% year on year, and a move toward \nwidening the daily trading band from 0.75% to 1.00% in March 2008 with flexibility up to 2.00% \nin June 2008. As a result of these measures, money supply (M2) slowed to an annualized rate \nof 19.0% in September 2008, from 46.1% in 2007. The credit growth rate in the banking system \nwas estimated at 37.0% over the same period. The Government has also tightened fiscal policy \nby improving tax collection and suspending or cancelling an estimated $2.1 billion in state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) projects in the second quarter of 2008. Thus the fiscal balance moved \nfrom a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in first half of 2008. \n \n6.  Overall, Fitch has affirmed Viet Nam\u2019s sovereign rating of BB minus, its BB minus long-\nterm foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) and its BB long-term local currency IDR. Fitch \nhas affirmed its short-term foreign currency IDR at B. Standard and Poor\u2019s sovereign rating for \nViet Nam is BB, while Moody\u2019s has assigned a Ba2 rating. All rating agencies have downgraded \ntheir outlook to negative pending further progress on inflation targeting by the Government.  \n \n2.  Challenges for the Future \n7.  Viet Nam will need to address the major challenges of continuing structural transition \ntoward a market-based economy, successful macroeconomic management in the medium-term \nto sustain growth, and improving the coordination and transparency of policy response with \nrespect to controlling inflation. \n   \n8.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  recently  outlined  a  package  of  four  policy \ninitiatives for Viet Nam to maintain investor confidence and restore macroeconomic stability. \nThese are (i) further tightening of monetary policy to bring credit growth and inflation under \ncontrol (i.e., make more effective use of interest rate policy to support positive real interest rates \nwithout disrupting financial intermediation in the banking system, as well as improved oversight \nof the banking system); (ii) improved budgetary control of expenditure and borrowing by SOEs \nwith future investments restricted to core areas of SOE business; (iii) revised fiscal plans for \n2008, including restrained budgetary expenditure and cutbacks in off-budget investments; and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008. Viet Nam Country Chapter. Asian Development Outlook 2008 Update. Manila (17 September). The \nvolume of imports of cars, motorcycles, steel, urea, paper, and cotton increased by 30\u2013414% over  the January\u2013\nAugust 2008 period from December 2007. The trade deficit widened to $14.8 billion in the first 6 months of 2008. \n ", "  3\n(iv) greater exchange rate flexibility to simplify monetary management and assist the State Bank \nof Vietnam (SBV) to better manage shifts in capital flows.7  The IMF encouraged further \nindependence for SBV and the ongoing equitization of SOEs and state-owned commercial \nbanks (SOCBs) as a means of improving corporate governance. \n \n9.  There are some indications that the macroeconomic situation has started to improve as \na result of coordinated Government measures. Capital has started moving back into dong-\ndenominated assets, bank deposits in dong have increased, and interest rates declined in July \nand August 2008. As a result, the yield on the 5-year Government bond moved to 17% in mid-\nAugust, after rising to about 20% in mid-June from less than 9% in early April. The Viet Nam \nindex in the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange strengthened to over 500 in August 2008 from \n366 in June, which represented a 60% loss in value from October 2007 (footnote 5). \n \nB.  The Banking Sector in Viet Nam \n1.  Overview \n10.  The 5-year socioeconomic development plan for 2006\u20132010 states that, in the area of \nbanking and finance, the Government will \u201cgradually abolish all preferences enjoyed by the \nstate-owned  commercial  banks,  and  stop  the  interference  of  the  SBV  in  the  business  of \ncommercial banks.\u201d8 SBV acts as a central bank and supervisory institution but is also a \nshareholder in SOCBs. The Government has drawn up a road map of future banking reforms to \naddress such institutional needs and has promoted a greater role for market mechanisms \nthrough equitizing SOCBs and opening the sector to foreign banks. With respect to compliance \nwith  international  standards,  Basel  I  standards9  are  currently  in  place,  and  SBV  aims  to \nimplement Basel II standards by 2010. \n \n11.  At present, the Government\u2019s primary concern is to fight inflation while ensuring steady \ngrowth in bank lending operations on the basis of more stringent guidelines. In this respect, SBV \nintroduced the following monetary policy measures in the first quarter of 2008: (i) an increase in \nbank reserve requirements from 5% to 11% of dong and foreign currency deposits with tenors of \nless than 12 months, effective from June 2007; (ii) the sale of D20.3 trillion ($1.3 billion) in 1-\nyear dong-denominated SBV bills to commercial banks to mop up excess liquidity; (iii) an \nincrease in the base rate by 325 basis points to 12% in May 2008 and to 14% in June 2008 (the \nnew effective maximum lending and deposit rates are officially reported to have been 1.5 times \nSBV\u2019s prime rate, i.e., 18%, in May 2008 and 19.5% in September 2008, though deposit rates \nvary across the banks); and (iv) an increase in its refinancing rate to 15% in June 2008 from \n7.5% in February 2008 and in its discount rate to 13% from 6.5% over the same period. To \nguard against losses in the speculative stock market, SBV took measures in early 2007 to slow \nand discontinue bank lending to securities company subsidiaries by raising the risk weight for \nsecurities-related loans to 250% from 100%; the maximum threshold for securities lending is \n20% of chartered capital, based on Decision 03/2008/Qd-NHNN of 1 February 2008.  More \nrecently, in response to tightening international credit flows, SBV has requested SOCBs to \nsupport enterprise access to credit by adjusting their lending rates.  As of October 2008, SOCB \nlending rates are 18.5% and in exceptional circumstances, range from 16.2% to 17.2%, below \n                                                 \n7   IMF. 2008. Viet Nam: Informal Mid-Year Consultative Group Meeting.  Lao Cai. (5\u20136 June). \n8  Ministry of Planning and Investment, Viet Nam. 2006. The Five Year Socio Economic Development Plan 2006\u2013\n2010. Hanoi (page 77). \n9  Basel I standards established the minimum capital requirements for banks when issued in 1988 by the Bank for \nInternational Settlements. Basel II standards, which are considered to be more comprehensive, are in the process \nof being implemented by several countries. Viet Nam has not yet implemented Basel II standards.  \n ", "4   \nthe earlier SBV established ceiling of 19.5%.  Lending rates offered by the JSBs are also \noccasionally lower than the ceiling. \n \n12.  As  per  SBV\u2019s  Decision  No.  13/2008/QD-NHNN  of  29  April  2008,  promulgating  the \nregulation on the operation networks of commercial banks, SBV restricted growth in bank \noperations, i.e. opening of new branches, through tighter conditions placed on bank financial \ncapital.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also ordered SBV to cap credit growth at 30 per cent \nper year. This measure was introduced to slow loan growth and guard against nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) in some joint-stock banks (JSBs), where loan books grew by over 100% over \n2006\u20132007. Total bank loans grew by 53% in 2007, though SOCBs have maintained the most \nconservative  approach  to  loan  portfolio  growth  (24%  in  2007)  to  focus  on  improving \ncapitalization and loan book quality in preparation for equitization. The smaller JSBs are the \nmost exposed in terms of asset\u2013liability mismatch and property market portfolio concentration, \nand they will likely come under pressure to either declare bankruptcy or merge with a larger \nbank during 2008.  \n \n2.  Performance \n13.  The banking sector has grown significantly since the adoption of the Law on Credit \nInstitutions in 1997 (Decree 02-1997-QH10, dated 12 December 1997), which allowed a variety \nof products to be offered by credit institutions and introduced prudential provisions including \ncapital norms, restrictions on asset and liability management, deposit insurance, and limits on \ncredit institutions\u2019 investments in real estate. The number of banks increased significantly over \nthe past decade as a result of SBV deregulation. The number of registered banks is high, with 5 \njoint  venture  banks,  36  private  banks,  44  foreign  bank  branches,  and  55  foreign  bank \nrepresentative offices.  While the banking system is still characterized by the strong presence of \nthe 4 SOCBs, JSBs are slowly gaining market share.  Other state banks include the Vietnam \nCommercial Bank, Vietnam Development Bank and Vietnam Bank for Social Policies.   \n \n14.  With respect to the recent medium-term outlook, Fitch\u2019s Viet Nam bank report on 29 May \n2008 indicates that strong economic growth has provided significant expansion opportunities for \nthe commercial banks in Viet Nam and that, furthermore, low penetration overall\u2014with less than \n5% of the population regularly using banking services and 10\u201320% holding bank accounts\u2014\nprovides good opportunities for growth in the banking sector in the medium-to-long term. In \nparticular,  Fitch  indicates  that  large  private  banks  that,  like  Sacombank,  have  a  major \ninternational bank as a strategic investor stand to gain from their more commercially oriented \nand improved risk-based banking operations. Loan growth for the large private commercial \nbanks, including Sacombank, has generally been in trade, manufacturing, and well-secured \nmortgages  with  relatively  low  exposure  in  the  speculative  property  development  market. \nSacombank indicates prudent portfolio expansion.  \n \n15.  With their recent expansion, private banks are undermining the market dominance of the \nSOCBs, particularly in the retail sector. In terms of market structure, the four major SOCBs \naccounted for 50% of total loans at end-2007, down from 62% at end-2006. The five larger \nurban JSBs,10 each with a major international bank as a minority strategic foreign investor, \ncurrently account for over 20% of market share, followed by 19 smaller banks and 12 small, \nrural JSBs.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Sacombank, Techcombank, Viet Nam International Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Commercial Bank. \n ", "  5\n16.  According to Fitch, there are no expected domestic liquidity concerns for SOCBs, as \ntheir deposit franchises are strong and their deposit funding stands to benefit during a flight to \nquality. In 2007, deposit growth held up well at around 22% on average to support loan growth. \nDepositors are, however, monitoring the benefits of purchasing gold versus maintaining savings \nin interest-bearing accounts. NPLs have declined, but overall asset quality is inferior to that of \nthe  private  banks,  though  some  SOCBs  that  are  preparing  for  equitization,  including \nVietcombank,  have  taken  specific  measures  to  improve  loan  quality  and  recognize \nnonperforming assets.

The balance sheets of the larger joint-stock commercial banks look healthy overall. \nThese banks are considered to have a sufficiently strong deposit franchise to ensure continued \nliquidity.  The  recent  Fitch  banking  report  indicates  that,  in  general,  capitalization  appears \nsatisfactory,  with  equity/loans  ratios  ranging  from  13%  to  21%.

Viet Nam\u2019s recent accession to WTO, which allows \nforeign banks to set up wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, is expected to increase competition in \nthe banking sector. It is reported that SBV expects to receive around 20 new applications for \nbanks from large corporations and seven foreign banks. Among the applicants are Standard \nChartered Bank and banks from Taipei, China and the Republic of Korea. Australia and New \nZealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation (HSBC), Standard \nChartered, and Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited have all purchased interests in \nlocal banks. In 2008, Standard Chartered, HSBC, and ANZ became the first foreign banks \npermitted to found their wholly owned corporations in Viet Nam.11  \n  \n19.  The nonbank financial intermediaries sector and institutional investors, other than the \ninsurance sector, are insignificant. The market for primary government debt is quite rudimentary, \nwhile  the  secondary  government  debt  and  corporate  debt  markets  are  highly  illiquid  and \nunderdeveloped. The absence of well-developed debt markets is a constraint on the ability of \nleasing companies to raise longer-term funds.12 The equities market, though small and still \ndeveloping, has shown significant growth as well as market correction. Total company listings at \nthe country's two stock-trading centers increased fourfold, from 44 to 193, between end-2005 \nand end-2006, and during the same period total market capitalization increased by almost 21 \ntimes, from D11 trillion to D231 trillion, or to 25% of GDP in 2006, compared with 1.3% at end-\n2005.  Market  capitalization  reached  D494.5  trillion  in  2007  (or  43.4%  of  GDP).  However, \nconcerns over the value of securities in the January\u2013June 2008 inflationary environment led to \ndivestment from the stock market into other forms of capital and gold, as well as to market \ncorrection in terms of the stock/price earnings ratio. Consequently, the total capitalization of Viet \nNam's two bourses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is estimated to amount to D294.5 trillion as of \nSeptember 2008, or approximately 25.8% of the country's GDP as of September 2008, half of \nthe market value recorded in 2007.  \n                                                 \n11  Each bank is required to have charter capital of at least D1 trillion ($620 million). \n12  As also indicated in ADB. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2377-VIE, for $75 million, approved on 6 December).  \n ", "  7\n \n20.  Bank Capitalization. Both the fall in value of the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange, \nwhere market value fell 30% over October 2007\u2013August 2008, and the recent inflationary spike \nplace constraints on Vietnamese banks\u2019 ability to raise capital. Consumers are placing their \ninvestments in traditionally secure investments, such as gold, and are at present reluctant to \ninvest  in  stocks.  Recent  uncertainties  have  contributed  to  some  JSBs\u2019  reconsidering  the \nissuance of a bond to assist with tier II capital. Until the inflationary situation stabilizes and \nconsumer confidence in securities is restored, few banks are expected to issue a domestic initial \npublic offering, rights issue, or bond. IMF Article 4 consultation meetings in Viet Nam are \nexpected to be concluded in October 2008 and the report issued in December 2008. IMF will \nlikely continue to draw attention to targeting inflation, uneven progress in SOCB and SOE \nreform, and the need for SBV independence. \n \n21.  Equitization of State-Owned Commercial Banks. To improve the competitiveness of \nthe financial sector and comply with WTO accession requirements with respect to opening the \nfinancial services market, the Government announced equitization plans for all five SOCBs in \n2005.13 The Government has indicated it will retain a majority share of 51% in most SOCBs over \nthe medium-to-long term. At present, up to 30% of the shares in each major SOCB may be sold \nto the public and foreign strategic partners. To support the restructuring of the banking sector, \nthe World Bank began implementing its Banking Sector Reform Program (2002\u20132015) with the \nfollowing activities: (i) restructuring SOCBs, (ii) restructuring non-state (joint-stock) banks, (iii) \nimproving the prudential regulatory and supervisory framework, and (iv) leveling the playing field \nfor all banks.  \n22.  Among SOCBs, Vietcombank was the first to initiate transition into a JSB through the \ndomestic sale of 6.5% of its shares in December 2007. Approximately 3.5% of the shares were \nsold to bank employees, with the remainder sold to national institutional investors. Any further \ninitial public offering, domestic or international, is being deferred until consumer and investor \nconfidence in emerging market stocks is restored.  \n23.  Joint-Stock Banks. The top five urban banks\u2014Techcombank, Sacombank, Viet Nam \nInternational Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Commercial Bank\u2014all have minority \ninternational strategic investors. The smaller urban JSB group consists of banks such as Habu \nBank, Viet A Bank, and Saigon Bank.  \n \n24.  The major JSBs have launched ambitious expansion plans. Over the past 4 years, \nSacombank, Asia Commercial Bank (ACB), and Techcombank have expanded their branch \nnetworks,  with  each  reaching  close  to  200  bank  branches  including  sub-branches  and \ntransaction centers. The rapid growth in the retail and SME markets was curtailed by the \nGovernment in early 2008 with the introduction of the 30% cap on further credit expansion and \nincreased monitoring with respect to overall banking sector provisioning. All the major banks are \naudited by accredited accounting firms. \n \n25.  Loan  growth  for  the  large  private  commercial  banks,  including  Sacombank,  has \ngenerally been in trade, manufacturing, and well-secured mortgages. While the specific impact \nof the fall in property prices needs to be assessed case by case for each major bank, project \ndue diligence of Sacombank indicates prudent portfolio expansion and appropriate provisioning \n                                                 \n13 The Government has committed to equitizing Vietcombank and Mekong Housing Bank in 2007, Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank) and Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV) in 2008, \nand Viet Nam Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development in 2009. \n ", "8   \nand mechanisms for monitoring credit risk, both at the head office and in branches.  \n \n26.  Potential for Growth. Opportunity for growth in the retail and SME markets is strong \nacross the banking sector. Overall penetration is low, as less than 5% of Viet Nam\u2019s total \npopulation of about 85 million regularly uses banking services and between 10% (according to \nInternational Financing Review Asia) and 20% (McKinsey) has bank accounts. Among the \nurban middle class of 8 million, defined as those with a monthly income of at least $500, only \n22% have bank accounts. The average loan is for $3,000, and, while the most common credit \nproduct is a car loan, new car sales have so far not exceeded 6,000 units per month. Loans to \nSMEs tend to be in the range of D1 billion\u2013D2 billion ($62,000\u2013$124,000) for short maturities \nand are highly secured. It is reported14 that access is very limited to loans of over D5 billion \n($312,000) or to medium- and long-term loans. Large private banks like Sacombank with a \nmajor international bank as a strategic investor stand to gain from their more commercially \noriented and improved risk-based banking operations.  \n \nC.  SME and Leasing Sector Background \n1.  Constraints to SME Development: Lack of Access to Financing  \n27.  SMEs play a significant role in the economy of Viet Nam and are the major source of \nemployment. The country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam indicates that \nover 165,000 enterprises have been registered under the 1999 Enterprise Law15 since its \nenactment in 2000 and that over 90% of these registered enterprises are SMEs with registered \ncapital of less than D10 billion ($625,000) and fewer than 300 employees. The CSP further \nstates that \u201cthe private sector now generates over 60% of GDP and employs 90% of the total \nworkforce. Rapid private sector development has been a key element of Viet Nam\u2019s pro-poor \nsocioeconomic development. The domestic private sector generates more employment and \noutput per unit of investment than either the state sector or foreign investors.\u201d16\n \n28.  To maintain enterprise growth, particularly during current inflationary trends, access to \nfinance needs to be facilitated and improved. The 2005 World Bank investment climate survey17 \nindicates access to finance to be a more significant constraint to enterprises in Viet Nam than \nelsewhere.  \n                                                 \n14  Ministry of Planning and Investment, Enterprise Development Department. 2007.

Data from World Bank investment climate survey database, using \nunweighted averages. \nSource: Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010.   \n \n29.  SMEs in Viet Nam have difficulty accessing financial services and securing financing, \nmainly because of the strong risk-adverse bias of banks with respect to SME lending. This \nperception is slowly changing, as some of the major JSBs and SOCBs begin to tailor credit \ninstruments  to  meet  the  needs  of  larger  SMEs.  Also,  some  commercial  banks,  such  as \nSacombank, have developed and implemented a financial strategy focused on penetrating the \nexpanding SME customer base in Viet Nam.  \n \n2.  Nascent Leasing Industry \n30.  From a developmental perspective, leasing is of particular importance for its role in \nfinancing SMEs that do not have either the capital to purchase equipment or the collateral to \naccess conventional sources of funds. An ADB survey of SMEs in Viet Nam, conducted during \ntechnical assistance in 2007,18 identified the following benefits of leasing: (i) leasing companies \nrequire less collateral than banks, as the asset being financed is the security; (ii) they are more \naggressive  with  respect  to  expanding  the  SME  client  base;  and  (iii)  leasing  allows  for \ncomplementary financing through commercial  bank credit lines. Most SMEs indicated their \nbusiness growth depends on continued access to lease financing for manufacturing equipment \nto fill both domestic and export orders. At present, the average loan to a customer from a \nleasing company is $88,000, and the average equity of the leasing company\u2019s SME client base \nis $170,000. The leasing industry has expanded by 15\u201320% per year and focuses mostly on two \nsectors: (i) transport and automobiles and (ii) industrial machinery and equipment.  \n \n31.  However, the leasing industry remains small. The total assets of the nonbanking sector \nare estimated to be less than 3% of total bank assets .19 The leasing industry, with total assets \nof D13.0 trillion ($814 million), accounts for 1.24% of the formal financial sector.20 \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2006.

Policy Reforms in the Leasing Sector. Leasing industry analyses undertaken during \nADB\u2019s Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II) and SME Sector Development Program Loan \n(SDPL)21 revealed that the funding gap in the leasing industry and regulatory constraints were \nthe major causes for the industry\u2019s slow growth. Accordingly, the Government undertook a \nseries of policy reforms under the FSPL II and the SDPL to assist the development of the \nleasing  sector.  Leasing  companies  are  licensed  and  regulated  by  SBV  and  regarded  as \nnonbank credit institutions under the Law on Credit Institutions. SBV\u2019s Decree 16/2001 ND/-CP \nof  2  May  2001  provided  the  broad  legal  framework  for  leasing  operations.  The  decree \nauthorizes only those financial leasing companies licensed by SBV to undertake finance leasing \ntransactions. The activities of leasing companies were initially restricted to financial leasing for \nmachinery, equipment, vehicles, other moveable assets, and other services related to financial \nleasing operations. The Government issued Decree 65/2005/ND-CP of 19 May 2005 to amend \nDecree 16, allowing for operating leasing, the sale of finance lease receivables and lease back, \nand syndicated lease transactions. Decree 65 provides for a limit of exposure to a single client \nequal to 30% of all capital of a finance leasing company and outlines the broad procedures for \nenforcing leasing contracts. Under the technical assistance (TA) for the Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development Program, implemented over the period March\u2013October 2007,22 \nADB trained leasing companies on upgrading lease agreements to clarify lessor and lessee \ncommercial obligations and mitigate the risk of repossession. Constraints remain in the area of \ninterministerial coordination on repossession, in particular among the commercial court, Ministry \nof Justice, and Economic Police. ADB is maintaining dialogue with the Government on this issue \nunder FSPL III, approved in 2007.  \n \n33.  Use of Self Help. To facilitate the use of self help by leasing companies, ADB undertook \na series of consultations with the industry and the Government in 2007. TA 4781 consultations \nled to the Government\u2019s issuing Circular No.08/2007/TT-NHNN-BCA-BTP dated 12 October \n2007, Guidelines on Repossession and Settlement of Leasing Assets of Leasing Company. The \ncircular clarifies the rights of the leasing company to the recovery of assets through the use of \nself  help  and  the  timeline  and  provides  clear  guidelines  on  the  scope  of  involvement  by \nGovernment ministries and people\u2019s committees in this area.  \n \n34.  Leasing companies have introduced the following measures to reduce the risks and \ncosts of repossession: (i) upgrading lease agreements to ensure both lessor and lessee are \nequally aware of obligations under the contract and knowledgeable about the use of self help \nand recourse to power of attorney, (ii) improved integration and association with suppliers to \nassist in valuating the item to be repossessed and its resale, (iii) restricting the financing of one-\noff assets used by a very limited number of companies, and (iv) specializing leasing officers in \nspecific  industries  and  equipment.  Other  measures  introduced  include  improved  marketing \ncampaigns  and  organization  of  workflow,  specifically  the  separation  of  active  from \nnonperforming accounts into specialized units, as well as improved performance measures. \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2004.

To mitigate inflationary pressures, SBV issued Decision \n03/2007/QD-NHNN on 19 January 2007 to amend Decision 457/2005/QD-NHNN regulating the \nsafety ratios of credit institutions\u2019 operations. Decision 3 places a cap equivalent to 10% of \nparent  bank  equity  on  parent  bank  funding  to  subsidiary  companies,  including  leasing \ncompanies, and requires relending to be extended at commercial interbank rates. There have \nbeen no amendments to Decision 03 in 2008.  \n \n36.  Market Assessment. Indications are that regulatory reforms have promoted the growth \nof the leasing sector in Viet Nam, which nearly doubled over the period 2005\u20132007. Over this \nperiod, outstanding leases grew from an estimated $374 million to $710 million; they stood at \n$814 million in June 2008. Leasing companies indicated they estimate growth rates of 20\u201330% \nyear on year, with ongoing strong demand from SMEs for automobiles and industrial machinery.  \n \n37.  Funding Gap. Leasing industry analyses undertaken during the FSPL II and the SDPL \nrevealed that the funding gap in the leasing industry and regulatory constraints were the major \ncauses  for  the  industry\u2019s  slow  growth.  Leasing  company  funding  is  exclusively  through \nborrowings from the parent bank. Access to short-term customer deposit funds from the parent \nbank (under 360 days at floating 90\u2013180 day rates) and, in the case of some leasing companies, \nfrom customer deposits (under 13 months), is creating a funding mismatch with respect to \nmedium- and long-term leases issued by leasing companies in response to customer demand.  \n \n38.  Market Structure. There are 13 leasing companies in Viet Nam, categorized under \nDecree 16 as state run (seven), affiliate (four), and joint venture (two), with no companies \ncurrently in the joint-stock category. \n \nTable 4: Leasing Sector Overview, end-2006 \n \nCompany  Shareholders \nAffiliate Financial Leasing Companies of Credit Institutions \nKexim Leasing Company    \nChailease International Leasing Company  Chailease Finance Co.

Sacombank offers a full range of banking services, including deposit taking in dong and \nforeign currencies (primarily US dollars), lending, trade finance, guarantees, treasury services, \nand credit card and payment services across all market segments. Sacombank is primarily an \nSME bank, as over 60% of its loans are to SMEs. The bank aims to further improve its service \nto SMEs by expanding the provision of financial leases across 30 major branches in Viet Nam in \n2008. By offering the complementary service of SME working capital and factoring together with \nmedium-term financial leases, the bank looks to deepen its penetration of the SME market and \ncreate the opportunity to attract firms with smaller equity bases to grow within the integrated \nSacombank SME financial services program. To comply with internal and national prudential \nregulations, Sacombank has indicated that the branch-based lease financing program will be \nguided by the bank\u2019s internal risk-management procedures strictly administered and monitored \nat the branch level.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN  \nA.  ADB Loan  \n42.  ADB identified the loan further to policy dialogue undertaken with the Government under \nFSPL II and SDPL. The policy programs highlighted the constraints on SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand addressed upgrading the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate the development of the \nleasing  industry.  In  2007,  during  TA  4781  implementation,  all  leasing  companies  received \ncomprehensive training on risk management, risk pricing, and marketing lease products. ADB \nundertook due diligence of all major leasing companies and their parent banks in Viet Nam and \nupgraded regulations referring to self help.25 See Appendix 2 for the ranking methodology and \nAppendix 3 for the legal and regulatory upgrading actions undertaken by ADB. \n \n43.  This is the second nonsovereign loan to the leasing sector in Viet Nam. The ADB Board \napproved the first nonsovereign loan to Vietcombank, for onlending to its leasing subsidiary, in \nDecember 2007.26  At the time, the ADB project team brought to the attention of the Board the \ninterest  expressed  by  Sacombank,  another  qualifying  bank,  and  its  leasing  company,  to \nparticipate in ADB\u2019s nonsovereign loan. However, because interest was expressed late, in \n                                                 \n25 Under TA 4781, March\u2013October 2007, ADB undertook a series of consultations with the leasing companies and \nthe Government to clarify the use of self help and thereby facilitated the issuance of Circular No. 08/2007/TT-\nNHNN-BCA-BTP, dated 10 October 2007, Guidelines on repossession and settlement of leasing assets of leasing \ncompany. This circular clarifies the rights of the leasing companies to the recovery of assets through the use of self \nhelp and the timelines and provides clear guidelines on the scope of involvement by Government ministries and \npeople\u2019s committees in this area.   \n26 In December 2007, the Board strongly requested that there be a level playing field between the public and private \nsector and that the next ADB nonsovereign loan consider a JSB bank and subsidiary leasing company.    \n ", "14  \nOctober 2007, ADB indicated that the loan to Sacombank would need to be processed further to \nfull due diligence and submitted the loan request for ADB Board approval in 2008.  \n \n44.  ADB is proposing to provide a senior loan to the Borrower of up to $25 million. The \nBorrower will onlend $5 million to its fully owned subsidiary, SLC, to support the development of \nlease financing, particularly for equipment lease financing, which is an area of growing demand \nfrom Viet Nam\u2019s manufacturing SMEs. To facilitate access to finance, it is proposed that the \nbank and the leasing company relend repayments on term loans and leases as long as the \nmaturity falls within the tenor of the ADB loan. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification \n1.  Development Outcome \n45.  ADB\u2019s sequential activities in the leasing sector are expected to create a demonstration \neffect in both the SOCB and the JSB sector regarding the commercial benefits of leasing to \nSMEs. The loan is a pilot that will facilitate improved access to medium-term leases from SLC to \nSMEs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Co-locating the leasing company in 30 bank branches will \n(i) create a demonstration effect for the industry on the cost-effective delivery of SME lease \nfinancing within the parent branch network; (ii) allow SLC to incubate smaller SMEs that access \nthe formal financial sector through leasing and refer smaller SME customers with a credit history \nin  SLC  to  the  bank,  thereby  facilitating  their  formal  access  to  complementary  short-  and \nmedium-term finance instruments; and (iii) gradually allow SLC to take over the equipment \nfinancing activity provided by the parent, which is more costly to SMEs in terms of collateral \nrequirements, and grow the more competitive equipment lease financing provided by the leasing \ncompany. The small size of the loan and the small market share of SLC, at only 2% of the \nleasing industry, will guard against an adverse impact on competition. As a percentage of bank \nassets, Sacombank holds 6% of the assets of the eight largest banks in Viet Nam. The low \nimpact on competition has been verified in consultations with public and private entities held at \nSBV. Interest has been expressed by other qualifying SOCB and JSB leasing companies in \naccessing a subsequent ADB loan in the area of lease financing. The loan will promote the \nfollowing developments: \n \n (i)  SME growth and leasing industry strengthening. Access to finance for SMEs \nis at present highly constrained, particularly for term loans and in amounts that \nrange between $125,000 and $250,000, by banks\u2019 high collateral requirements \nand demands for an established credit history. It is estimated that ADB\u2019s loan will \nfund up to 70 new financial leases to SMEs at terms of 3\u20135 years, assuming 75% \nof the loan equivalent is revolved once by the leasing company, and between 80 \nand 160 new loans to SMEs referred to the bank through the leasing company. \nTerm funding provided by ADB to the parent bank will allow for relending either \ndong or dollars to the bank and the leasing company as per their requirements. \nAt present, Sacombank provides both dong and dollar loans, and Sacombank \nleasing company provides financial leases in both dong and dollars at adjustable \nrates.  \n \n(ii)  Job creation and revenue generation. Improved access to finance for SMEs, in \nparticular  those  in  labor-intensive  manufacturing  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in \ntransportation,  will  create  jobs  and  generate  revenue.  Leasing  companies \n ", "  15\nindicate that their present customer base has an employee roster ranging from \n50 to 300. The loan will thus directly assist in creating approximately 10,000 \nadditional jobs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.  \n \n(iii)  Capital markets development. Leasing companies can help develop capital \nmarkets over time. Once they establish an operating history and a portfolio of \nterm leases, they will be able to begin securitizing lease receivables, taking some \nassets off the balance sheet to achieve a higher leverage and better returns, thus \ndeveloping an additional tradable instrument on the national capital market.  \n \n(iv)  Strengthening  of  the  banking  sector.  The  Government  has  identified  the \nbanking sector as a priority for reform. The proposed ADB assistance is in the \narea of corporate governance and market-based business strategy, policy, and \nplanning and provides a means to strengthen the banking sector at a time of \ninflationary  risk.  Co-locating  lease  finance  services  in  over  30  bank  branch \nnetworks will (a) facilitate the referral of new SMEs within the bank network; (b) \nimprove the integrated delivery of lease finance and SME finance as a more \ncomprehensive financing tool for SMEs in the present restrictive credit market; (c) \nallow SMEs to conserve cash and hedge their financing risks across more than \none  financing  instrument;  and  (d)  allow  for  two-stage  due  diligence  of  the \ncustomer by SLC and the bank, thus protecting the institutional portfolio from risk.  \n \n2.  Investment Objectives \n46.  ADB\u2019s objectives for the proposed loan are to (i) create a demonstration effect in the \nbanking industry on the complementary delivery of leasing and credit instruments; (ii) facilitate \nSMEs\u2019 access to the formal financial sector via leasing while preserving their cash by treating \nthe equipment as collateral; and (iii) create efficiency and maximize service delivery on a \nprudential basis to the expanding SME sector27 through the integrated SME credit reference \nsystem from the leasing company to the parent bank. \n \n47.  The proposed loan will enable Sacombank to meet its dual objective of (i) extending \nterm leases to SMEs through SLC through its branch networks in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi \nand (ii) facilitating complementary SME credit on a prudent basis. The capacity building28 \nprovided by ADB over March\u2013October 2007 to 10 leasing companies in Viet Nam will help SLC \nfurther improve the pricing of its leases as per market risk and the marketing of its financial \nlease products.  \n \n3.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n48.  ADB has prepared a design and monitoring framework and will measure the expected \ndevelopment impact of the loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Management Development Results \nPolicy.29  \n \n                                                 \n27 Consultations held by ADB with leasing companies and SMEs in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City indicate that \nsuppliers on contract with the leasing company comply with technical standards specified by the leasing company \nand the SME customer base. \n28 All training materials developed under TA 4781 will be provided to SBV and the 10 leasing companies to facilitate \nongoing in-house training during the implementation of the loan. \n29 ADB. 2007. Management Development Results Policy. Manila.  \n ", "16  \n4.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy and Program \n49.  The CSP highlights rapid GDP growth in Viet Nam, averaging 7.5% over the past \ndecade, arising from strong export performance (with exports representing 61% of GDP in \n2005),  increased  employment  share  in  manufacturing  and  services,  and  high  inward \nremittances. Accession to WTO in January 2007 will facilitate sustained export growth and \nongoing diversification in manufacturing and services, as well as the ongoing development of \nthe private sector. It is estimated the private sector accounted for almost 90% of the 7.5 million \njobs created in 2005, of which 64% were generated by SMEs. The CSP highlights the need for \n\u201cthe Government and ADB\u2026to focus on facilitating increased private sector investment and \ndeveloping market institutions needed to promote competitiveness and create jobs.\u201d30\n \n50.  Business-Led Growth. Support for business-led growth is a major focus of the CSP. \nSector and subsector selection has been prioritized on the basis of the following factors: (i) \nADB\u2019s successes and comparative advantages, (ii) the Government\u2019s needs underlined by \ncontinued  commitment  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  (iii)  bottlenecks  that  hamper  the \ncreation of an enabling environment for inclusive business-led growth and job creation, and (iv) \nevidence  of  a  financing  gap  that  cannot  be  met  by  private  or  grant  financing. 31   The \ncomplementary lease and SME credit loan fully meets the Government\u2019s objective of improving \nSME  integration  in  the  formal  financial  sector  through  lease  financing  and  creates  a \ndemonstration effect for the banking industry on complementary product development.  \n \n51.  ADB supports the development of the financial sector through assistance to banks and \nnonbank financial institutions such as leasing and insurance companies. ADB\u2019s Medium-Term \nStrategy  II  (2006\u20132008)32  sets  as  a  priority  strengthening  the  financial  sector  in  member \ncountries. \n \n52.  The CSP identifies the need for ADB to assist in developing capital markets, particularly \nthe bond market, in Viet Nam. As the primary market for leasing develops\u2014and as leasing \ncompanies develop leases with both fixed and flexible rates, thus allowing for standardizing \nlease documents\u2014there will be an opportunity to refinance the lease portfolio as it gains volume. \nThis will eventually allow the issuance of lease-backed securities.  \n \n53.  Finally, the CSP envisages a rapid migration of Vietnamese from rural to urban areas in \nthe coming years. This loan will facilitate employment generation by SMEs to absorb this \ngrowing  labor  supply.  The  project  contributes  to  developing  SMEs  by  extending  the  term \nstructure of available financial lease products.   \n \n54.  ADB\u2019s Support for Leasing. ADB\u2019s initiative to address the issue of leasing builds on \nits private sector activities in this area. ADB actively promotes the leasing industry in Asia and \nhas provided technical assistance to support the emergence of this activity, which has proved its \neffectiveness, particularly in countries where the banking sector was not able to offer loans with \nadequate tenor to secure the acquisition of capital goods.  \n \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2006.

Sacombank and SLC \nwill be required to maintain an environmental management system following the guidelines \nagreed  with  ADB.  Sacombank  and  SLC  continue  to  receive  IFC  technical  assistance  on \nenvironmental due diligence upgrading, most recently on clean technologies.    \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n56.  As an FSPL II policy action, the Government set up and operationalized the Anti-Money \nLaundering  Information  Center  in  SBV  to  support  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Decree \nimplemented in 2005. The staffing of the center and the implementation of standard operating \nprocedures supported by an information technology system will allow for monitoring commercial \nbank transactions by end-2008. Viet Nam is now a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering. Vietcombank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003).Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require in the reimbursement and indemnity agreements that Sacombank institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism. Further, Sacombank will undertake to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities.  The  documentation  between  ADB  and  Sacombank  will  further  allow  ADB  to \ninvestigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. The loan covenants will \nextend to SLC.  \n \n57.  The CSP highlights the Government\u2019s commitment to combating corruption through its \ndecision to join the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in 2003 and the ADB-OECD \nAnticorruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific in 2004, and by laws implemented in 2006 to \naddress corruption and improve transparency, particularly in the areas of public procurement, \nconstruction, state audit, civil service, and land administration.33\n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n58.  No  Objection  Letter.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Government of Viet Nam will be requested to confirm that it has no \nobjection to the proposed loan to Sacombank. The loan will not be disbursed until ADB receives \nsuch confirmation. \n \n59.  Documentation. ADB will enter into suitable documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n60.

Policy Reforms in the Leasing Sector  \n \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) implemented a series of policy and legal \nreforms under the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) II and the Sector Development Program \nLoan  to  assist  the  development  of  the  leasing  sector.  Leasing  companies  are  licensed  and \nregulated by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and regarded as nonbank credit institutions under \nthe Law on Credit Institutions. SBV\u2019s Decree 16/2001 ND/-CP, issued on 2 May 2001, provided the \nbroad legal framework for leasing operations. The decree authorizes only those financial leasing \ncompanies licensed by SBV to undertake finance leasing transactions. The activities of leasing \ncompanies were initially restricted to financial leasing for machinery, equipment, vehicles, other \nmoveable assets, and other services related to financial leasing operations.  \n \n2.  The Government issued Decree 65/2005/ND-CP on 19 May 2005 to amend Decree 16, \nallowing  for  operating  leasing,  the  sale  of  finance  lease  receivables  and  lease  back,  and \nsyndicated lease transactions. Decree 65 provides for a limit of exposure to a single client equal to \n30% of all capital of a finance leasing company and outlines the broad procedures for enforcing \nleasing contracts. However, inconsistencies remain in the implementing guidelines on enforcement \nas reviewed with the Government and leasing companies in interministerial consultations held at \nSBV in the second and third quarter of 2007. FSPL III, approved in 2007, will maintain a policy \ndialogue with the Government on continuing measures to improve enforcement procedures as \nreviewed in interministerial consultations.  \n \n3.  On 25 August 2008, the Government issued Decree 95/2008/ND-CP, amending some of \nthe  articles  of  Decree  16/2001/ND/CP  of  2  May  2001,  on  the  organization  and  operation  of \nfinancial  leasing  companies.  The  new  decree  clarifies  that  a  financial  leasing  company  is  a \nnonbank credit institution, a Vietnamese entity that is established and operates in Viet Nam as \neither of the following (refer also to para. 38 of the main text of the report and recommendation of \nthe President): (i) a shareholding company, (ii) a limited company of at least two members, and (iii) \na limited company of one member. Joint venture financial leasing companies (none at present) and \n100%  foreign-invested  financial  leasing  companies  (two),  are  respectively  in  the  last  two \ncategories. These entities are eligible to obtain an operating license if their total corporate assets \nare over $10 billion at the end of the preceding year. \n \nB.  Legal and Regulatory Environment for the Financial Leasing Industry \n \n4.  The  financial  leasing  industry  is  regulated  by  a  complex  matrix  of  appropriate  laws34 \nRegulation by SBV is through the issue of circulars and decisions and through inspection, both \nonsite and off. Offsite inspection is on a continuous reporting basis, while onsite inspection is every \n3 years, unless circumstances require more frequent inspections. Inspection is undertaken from \nHanoi. In the past 12 months, warnings have been given in respect of asset concentration and \nclient concentration. Inspection is traditional and not risk based.  \n \n5.  Financial leasing companies are required to provide the inspector with their procedures for \nrescheduling  the  period  of  lease  payments. 35   Leasing  companies  do  not  currently  have \n                                                 \n34 See the Decree on the Organisation and Operation of Finance Leasing Companies, the Credit Institutions Law02-\n1997-QH10, the Financial Leasing companies, being defined as credit institutions, the Law on the State Bank of Viet \nNam 06-1997-QHX and the Decree on Security Transactions 163/2006/ND-CP 29. 12. 2006, the Civil Code and the \nCommercial  Law.

SBV Decision 03/2007/QD-NHNN, issued in January 2007, places a cap equivalent to 10% \nof  parent  bank  equity  on  parent  bank  funding  to  subsidiary  leasing  companies  and  requires \nonlending to be extended at commercial interbank rates. There have been no further changes or \nrevisions to Decision 3 to date in 2008.  \n \n7.  Value-added tax is applied on the purchase of assets for lease but not on the lease \ntransactions. The input credit is passed to the lessee, and there is no double taxation upon the sale \nof a leased asset to a lessee.36 Satisfactory provision of depreciation is found in the Decision on \nthe Regime on Management, Use, and Calculation of Fixed Assets.37\n \nC.  The Private Legal Regime \n \n8.  Additional  specifications  in  the  financial  leasing  agreement  are  required  to  adequately \nminimize of risk for the financial leasing company and to assist it in recovering its leased asset in \nthe event of default. It is unclear from the civil code whether the power of attorney can be used in \nrepossession. This will be clarified under further due diligence. \n \nD.   Repossession and Bankruptcy \n \n9.  Repossession is reported by the financial leasing companies as being difficult. To address \nthis, Decree No 65 was passed in May 2005. It provides for self help in the recovery of the leased \nassets without the intervention of the courts. The implementation of the decree has been difficult, \nwith public officials not applying or enforcing it. This matter needs to be addressed under FSPL III. \n \n10.  Bankruptcy Law No: 21/2004/QH11 is modern and effectively drawn. The court rules in \nrespect of bankruptcy proceedings have been drawn and are operational.38\n \n11.  The practical implementation of the Bankruptcy Law is a problem. It is a complex and \nspecialized area of the law requiring additional training for the judiciary, the legal profession, \naccountants, officers of financial leasing companies, and others involved in the financial system. \nAs an important part of the armory for recovering debts due to financial leasing companies, \nattention to this matter is required, and it is being addressed under FSPL III. \n \nE.  Action Taken by Leasing Companies over 2007\u20132008 \n \n12.  Technical assistance (TA) 4781 undertook a series of consultations with leasing companies \nto upgrade lease agreements and thus reduce the risks and costs of repossession. Four pro forma \nlease agreements were developed under the technical assistance for Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Program\u2013Subprogram II39 adapted to individuals, private companies, and \npublic companies, as well as for airplanes. In 2008, leasing companies have begun to implement \n                                                 \n36 Refer to the Law on Value Added Tax as amended to 17 June 2003 2000 Circular 120/2003/TT-BTC, Circular  No 24-\n2002-TT-BTC, 20.3.2002. \n37 No. 206-2003-QD-BTC. \n38 Available: http://www.asianlii.org/vn/other/benchbk/244-en.html. \n39 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise \nDevelopment Program\u2013Subprogram II. Manila (TA 4781-VIE, for $600,000, approved on 20 April). \n \n ", "Appendix 3  23 \n    Append ix 3        23\nthe following measures to strengthen their growth: (i) upgraded lease agreements to ensure both \nlessor and lessee are equally aware of obligations under the contract and knowledgeable about the \nuse of self help as well as recourse to power of attorney, (ii) improved integration and association \nwith suppliers to assist the valuation of the item to be repossessed and its resale, (iii) restricted \nfinancing of one-off assets used by a very limited number of companies, (iv) specialization of \nleasing officers in specific industries and equipment, and more recently (v) improved coordination \nbetween the parent bank and the leasing subsidiary to ensure the consistent marketing of lease \nfinance products. Other measures being introduced include improved marketing campaigns and \norganization of workflow, specifically the separation of active from nonperforming accounts into \nspecialized units, as well as improved performance measures. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090602095730+08'00'", "Author": "Ma.
