Fruits, medicinal plants,\nand  vegetables  with  high  commercial  value  and  ready  markets  will\nbe  grown.  Breeding,  raising,  and  fattening  cattle,  goats,  pigs,  and\nsheep  will  be  assisted.    These  activities  will  increase  household\nincomes  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  poorest  region  of  the  province.\nTechnical  advice  and  training  will  improve  the  quality  of  produce.\nEnvironmentally  sound  agronomic  practices  and  land  development\ntechniques will be introduced to prevent soil erosion and pollution.\n\nPrimary objective - economic growth\nSecondary objective \u2013 poverty reduction\n\nCategory A\nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  undertaken,  and\nthe summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 4 November 1998.\n\nThe economic development of West Henan is severely constrained\nby  its  high  population  density,  hilly  to  mountainous  terrain,  scarce\narable  land,  harsh  climatic  conditions,  and  limited  water  resources.\nAverage per capita annual income is Y1,864 ($225).  The incidence\nof  poverty  (at  $1  per  day)  in  this  region  is  high(cid:190) 12  percent  as\nagainst less than 10 percent for the PRC. Of the 32 counties in West\nHenan, 12 are nationally designated absolute poverty counties. The\nregion is suitable for the cultivation of a number of temperate fruits\nand  nuts  and  a  variety  of  medicinal  plants.    The  region  is  also\nbecoming a major supplier of beef, mutton, and pork because of the\navailability  of  underutilized  pastures  and  cattle  and  small  livestock\nwell adapted to local conditions. The shortage of medium- and long-\nterm rural credit and inadequate potable and irrigation water supply\nhave  constrained  horticultural  and  livestock  development.    The\nProject is designed to help remove these constraints.\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  primary  objective  is  to  promote  pro-poor  economic\ngrowth by increasing the incomes of predominantly poor farmers in\nWest Henan. The Project consists of three components:\n\n(i)  horticulture  development,  which  supports  the  rehabilitation,\ndevelopment, and improvement of fruit tree crops (apples, Chinese\ndates, kiwi fruit), medicinal plants (gingko and eucommia), and field\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjective\nand Scope\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $151.3  million  equivalent,  of\nwhich  $66.1 million  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $85.2  million\nequivalent is the local cost.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n                  ($ million)\n\niv\n\nand greenhouse vegetables;\n\n(ii) livestock development, which supports household cattle and pig\nbreeding  and  raising,  purebred  piggeries,  and  sheep  and  goat\nbreeding  and  raising,  using  crop  residues  and  underutilized\ngrasslands; and\n\n(iii) water supply and irrigation scheme, which provides pumping and\nconveying facilities to draw and transfer water from the Yellow River\nto  Yima  City  and  Mianchi  County  to  meet  their  acute  rural,  urban,\nand  industrial  water  demands,  and  to  supply  water  for  orchard\nirrigation and livestock uses.\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange Currency Cost\n\n Local\n\nTotal          Percentage\n\nADB \n\n64.3\n\n\u2013\n\n64.3\n\nLocal Sources\n\n1.8            85.2          87.0\n\nTotal\n\n66.1\n\n85.2\n\n151.3\n\n42\n\n58\n\n100\n\n$64.3 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with a maturity\nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending\nrate  system  for  US  dollar  loans,  a  commitment  fee  of  0.75  percent\nper annum, and a front-end fee of 1.0 percent.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  onlend  the  ADB  loan  under  the  same\nterms  and  conditions  to  the  provincial  government  of  Henan.

Subsequent  project  processing  over  several  years  allowed  careful\nassessment of issues related to project design and quality, implementation arrangements, and\npoverty  targeting,  thus  improving  project  quality  at  entry.    A  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the\nPRC  in  February-March  1997,  with  follow-up  Fact-Finding/Consultation  Missions  in  August\n1998, January 1999, September 1999, and January 2000. The missions resulted in substantial\nscaling  down  of  the  Project,  removal  of  a  large  agroprocessing  component,  deletion  of\ncommercially risky components, focus reorientation toward poverty reduction, and change of the\nExecuting  Agency  (EA).      A  small-scale  TA2  approved  in  October  1999  updated  the  results  of\nthe  earlier  studies  and  confirmed  the  technical  assumptions.  This  TA  was  followed  by  an\nAppraisal Mission3 in April-May 2000. This report is based on the findings of ADB Missions, the\nADB-funded feasibility study and small-scale TA, as well as extensive discussions with national,\nprovincial,  and  local  government  officials,  prospective  local  investors,  target  beneficiaries,  and\nothers who may be affected by the Project.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nThe Agriculture and Rural Sector\n\n3.\nPoverty in the PRC is primarily a rural problem, although there are emerging pockets of\nurban poverty.4  In 1978, the household responsibility system was introduced, providing farmers\nwith  greater  incentives  for  production.    From  1978  to  1984,  agricultural  terms  of  trade  were\nprogressively improved.  In combination, these measures brought down the number of the rural\npoor  (based  on  national  standards)  from  260  million  in  1978  to  89  million  (11  percent  of  the\npopulation)  in  1984.    By  1999,  the  official  number  of  the  rural  poor  had  dropped  to  34  million\n(under  3  percent  of  the  population).  Many  of  these  poor  households  are  located  in  areas  that\nare relatively disadvantaged due to remoteness, climatic constraints, steep slopes or erosion, or\nsubject to frequent natural disasters.\n\n4.\nAgriculture,  including  crops,  livestock,  forestry,  fisheries,  and  rural  sideline  activities,\nprovides  an  important  source  of  income  for  about  200  million  farm  families  and  accounted  for\n18.7 percent  of PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998. About 96.7 million hectares (ha)\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 2042-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development Project, for $600,000, approved on 29 December 1993.\n2  TA 3281-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development, for $150,000, approved on 26 October 1999.\n3 The Mission comprised Peter N. King (Mission Leader), Emile Gozali (Project Economist), David Sobel (Programs\nOfficer), Susanna Price (Senior Social Development Specialist), Christophe Gautrot (Counsel), Barry Deren (Staff\nConsultant \u2013 Economist), and Wu Guabao (Staff Consultant \u2013 Poverty Specialist).\n\n4  TA  3150-PRC:  Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty Reduction Projects,  for  $715,000,  approved  on  31\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f2\n\nof PRC\u2019s land area of 960 million ha is cultivated(cid:190)7 percent of the world\u2019s farmland to support\n22  percent  of  its  people.  From  1990-1996,  an  average  of  400,000  ha  per  year  was  converted\nfrom  agriculture  to  industrial,  infrastructure,  and  housing  use.  To  address  this  issue,  the\nGovernment  enacted  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law  to  protect  arable  land  and  limit\nconversion  to  other  uses  to  160,000  ha  per  year,5  with  an  equivalent  amount  of  wasteland\nconverted to agricultural use. Because of the pressure on agricultural land, farming systems are\nintensive  with  heavy  inputs  of  labor,  chemical  and  organic  fertilizers,  small  machinery,  and\nwater. Intensive farming has allowed meeting the basic food requirements of the people along\nwith the development of a sophisticated mix of cash and commercial crops.\n\n5.\nThe  economic  reform  programs  in  agriculture  undertaken  in  the  late  1970s  and  early\n1980s provided successful examples later used in other sectors. The most important aspect of\nthe  agriculture  sector\u2019s  reform  program  was  the  replacement  of  the  commune  system  with  a\nhousehold  contract  responsibility  system  in  which  plots  of  collectively  owned  land  were\nallocated  to  households  under  fixed-term  contracts.  The  contract  required  the  households  to\nsupply the State with mandatory production quotas at fixed prices, with output above the quota\nallowed to be sold at market prices. State procurement prices were gradually increased, private\nplots were enlarged and contract periods extended, diversification of agricultural production was\nencouraged,  and  restrictions  on  rural  markets  and  nonagricultural  activities  were  relaxed.\nEconomic  reforms  also  encouraged  the  establishment  of  township  and  village  enterprises\n(TVEs), which are now an important part of the industrial structure and the major source of off-\nfarm employment for the surplus rural labor.\n\n6.\nThe  reforms  successfully  improved  the  terms  of  trade  for  agriculture,  increased\nagricultural  production,  and  created  rural  employment,  particularly  during  1978-1984  when\nagricultural  output  grew  by  an  annual  average  of  8.8  percent.  However,  agricultural  growth\nslowed  to  an  average  2.5  percent  in  1984-1990  before  recovering  to  3.8  percent  in  the  early\n1990s.    During  1988-1998,  agricultural  growth  averaged  4.4  percent,  well  in  excess  of\npopulation  growth  (less  than  1  percent),  but  much  lower  than  the  overall  GDP  growth  of  10.3\npercent.  Agricultural  growth  is  expected  to  remain  at  3-4  percent  per  annum  because  of  (i)\nunfavorable  terms  of  trade  for  agricultural  produce,  as  the  domestic  market  is  opened  to\ninternational  competition  following  entry  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO);  (ii)  relatively\nlow investment in rural infrastructure; (iii) outflow of labor from agriculture to other sectors, (iv)\ncontinued decline in the area of cultivated land compounded by desertification and soil erosion;\n(v)  fragmentation  of  landholdings;  and  (vi)  recurrence  of  natural  disasters  such  as  floods  and\ndrought.  Within  agriculture,  the  crop  subsector  has  experienced  the  greatest  slowdown.\nNevertheless,  food  grain  output  increased  by  1.7  percent  per  annum  during  1991-1998,\nreaching 512 million tons (t) in 1998, while population growth averaged less than 1 percent over\nthe  same  period.  Other  subsectors  (e.g.,  livestock,  fisheries,  and  horticulture),  where\nGovernment  interventions  are  less  and  market  forces  play  a  greater  role,  are  still  growing\nrapidly at up to 10 percent per year.\n\n7.\nEarly  reform  of  the  agriculture  sector  allowed  rural  incomes  to  rise  rapidly  so  that  the\nratio  of  urban  to  rural  incomes  fell  from  2.3  in  1980  to  1.7  in  1984.    From  the  mid-1980s,\nhowever, the rural-urban income disparity increased to a ratio of 2.7 in 1999, when average per\ncapita urban income was Y5,854 compared with Y2,210 for rural income. From 1990 to 1993,\nannual urban income growth averaged 11.2 percent in real terms while rural income grew by 3.2\n\n5  In 1997, only 136,000 ha of cultivable land was reported to have been lost to other uses.\n\n                  \n\n\f3\n\npercent.6  Nonagricultural  real  rural  income  grew  at  8.5  percent  annually  while  real  agricultural\nincomes remained almost constant, increasing by only 0.4 percent a year. From 1978 to 1998,\nthe  share  of  crop  farming  in  agricultural  gross  value  output  (GVO)  fell  from  80  percent  to  58\npercent.  The contribution of all agricultural output to rural GVO fell from 74 percent in 1978 to\n47 percent in 1998, largely due to the rapid growth of TVEs. The widening gap between urban\nand  farm  incomes  has  provided  compelling  incentives  for  migration  from  rural  to  urban  areas.\nThe income gap, coupled with the easing of restrictions on internal movements, has resulted in\nabout 100 million rural residents migrating to urban areas in the PRC.\n\n2.\n\nThe Agriculture and Rural Sector in Henan\n\n8.\nHenan  Province  comprises  17  prefectures  with  112  counties  consisting  of  2,137\ntownships, and 46 districts under the jurisdiction of cities. The population is about 94 million\u2014\nthe  largest  among  PRC\u2019s  provinces  and  autonomous  regions\u2014with  83  percent  living  in  farm\nhouseholds. The arable land area is 6.8 million ha, 40 percent of the 16.7 million ha total land\narea,  located  mainly  in  the  east  of  the  province.  Pasture  covers  about  0.3  million  ha,  forest\nabout 2.1 million ha, and wasteland and nonagricultural land about 7.3 million ha. Arable land\nper capita is 1.5 mu7 (0.1 ha)\u2014the national average is 2.1 mu, ranging from 0.8 mu in Fujian to\n8.2 mu in Heilongjiang  Province.  Henan is a major producer of wheat, corn, and cotton, mostly\ngrown under irrigated conditions on about 4.3 million ha. With an average annual rainfall of only\n785  millimeters  and  frequent  droughts,  productivity  of  field  crops  in  non-irrigated  lands  is  low.\nTree  crops,  both  fruits  and  forest  species,  form  an  integral  part  of  farming  systems  in  the\nprovince, particularly in the mountainous western part.  In 1998, fruit orchards covered 385,000\nha and output was 3,126,000 t.  The orchards, mostly in West Henan, are in specific regions,\ndepending  on  tradition,  farmer  knowledge,  soil  type  and  climatic  conditions.  In  1999,  field\nvegetables covering 934,000 ha had an output of 31 million t and greenhouses in 133,300 ha\nproduced 12 million t of vegetables.\n\nLivestock is an important activity of farming households in counties with natural pastures\n9.\nand grassland. There are about 13 million cattle, 34.4 million pigs, 23.6 million goats, and 1.9\nmillion sheep in the province. Cattle production has been increasing due to higher meat prices\nand changing dietary preferences to include more protein as disposable incomes rise. Increased\nuse  is  being  made  of  by-products  from  wheat  and  other  crops  as  livestock  fodder.  Goat\nproduction has increased substantially because of the development of an export market for goat\nhide.\n\nAgriculture  contributes  about  one  quarter  of  the  provincial  GDP.  The  sector  has\n10.\nprogressively  increased  its  market  orientation.  By  1998,  the  value  of  agricultural  output\nmarketed  had  risen  to  51  percent  of  total  output;  in  the  livestock  subsector,  the  share  was\nsubstantially higher.\n\n11.\nHenan  is  a  relatively  poor  interior  province.    Its  rural  agricultural  population  is  poor\ncompared with the national rural population. In 1998, the per capita rural income in Henan was\nY1,864  ($225),  86  percent  of  the  national  rural  average  of  Y2,162  ($260).  Henan  ranked  19th\namong  PRC\u2019s  31  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  in  terms  of  rural  income.  Average  per\ncapita rural income in the province substantially varies, ranging from Y1,360 in Nanzhao County\n\n                  \n\n6  In nominal terms, average annual per capita incomes of rural households increased by 15.9 percent during 1990-\n1996,  while  urban  incomes  increased  by  17.8  percent  over  the  same  period,  reflecting  the  improved  market\nconditions for agriculture post-1993.\n\n7  15 mu = 1 hectare.\n\n\f4\n\nto Y2,760 in Mengzhou County. Farming accounts for two thirds of the rural household income\nin the province; farm wages, and off-farm activities and employment account for the other third.\nOff-farm  activities  and  employment  in  the  157,000  TVEs  in  Henan  are  important  sources  of\nfamily income in rural areas, often leaving women in charge of agricultural activities.\n\n3.\n\nMarketing and Agricultural Support Services in Henan\n\n12.\nThe  efficient  marketing  and  movement  of  some  commodities  and  processed  products\nare  constrained  by  inadequate  infrastructure  capacity  in  wholesale  and  retail  market  outlets,\ntransportation,  storage,  and  processing.  While  the  number  of  rural,  urban,  and  city  markets\nincreased  in  the  1990s  in  response  to  market  changes,  most  have  limited,  if  any,  storage\nfacilities. The increased transportation of produce and goods to nonlocal markets has increased\nthe demand for investment in cost-effective, efficient transportation and improved road and rail\ninfrastructure.  The  provincial  government  of  Henan  (PGH)  is  currently  undertaking  major\ninfrastructure projects8 to overcome the transportation, storage, and processing constraints.\n\nThe  major  sources  of  agricultural  credit  are  the  Agricultural  Bank  of  China  (ABC),  the\n13.\nAgricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC), and the rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). ABC\nis  widely  represented  throughout  the  province,  with  18  branches  at  the  prefecture  level,  213\nsubbranches at the county level, and 2,904 business offices at the township and village levels.\nIn 1998, the Henan ABC lent a total of Y56.3 billion ($6.8 billion), of which 59 percent was for\nrural  commerce  (for  grain  and  cash  crop  purchases),  infrastructure,  and  other  commercial\nactivities; 23.1 percent for agriculture; and 17.9 percent for TVEs and industries. An ABC loan\ncovers part of the investment cost, and the borrower is expected to contribute up to 60 percent\nof  the  value  of  the  investment.  Accordingly,  ABC  loans  are  accessed  mainly  by  the  wealthier\nfarmers,  who  can  provide  fixed  assets  as  collateral.  In  poor  areas  like  West  Henan,  ABC\nprovides loans for poverty relief on behalf of the provincial Poverty Alleviation and Development\nOffice9 (PADO), at subsidized interest rates (3 percent in 1999).10 The main policy bank in rural\nareas, ADBC is responsible for providing credit for purchasing State quotas of grain, cotton, and\noil-bearing crops.\n\n14.\nNonbanking  finance  institutions  (NBFIs)  provide  an  alternative  source  of  credit  (and\nsavings  accounts)  for  farm  households.  About  25  percent  of  the  capital  available  in  Henan  is\nheld in the NBFIs. The 7,437 RCCs in the province are the major sources of credit for individual\nfarmers. The RCCs cover 2,600 townships and have subbranches in 4,837 villages. About 55\npercent  of  rural  households  are  RCC  members  who  can  secure  credit  on  rates  lower  than  for\nnonmember borrowers.  RCC funds have not been used exclusively for investment in the  rural\nareas.  To  rectify  this,  the  RCC  system  was  being  reorganized  with  ADB  assistance.11    Total\nlending by RCCs in 1996 was Y37 billion ($4.5 billion), comprising Y15.7 billion (42.4 percent)\nfor  agriculture,  Y15.6  billion  (42.2  percent)  for  TVEs,  and  Y5.7  billion  (15.4  percent)  for  other\ncommercial  activities.  Total  lending  by  RCCs  reached  Y52  billion  ($6.3  billion)  in  1998.  The\n\n                  \n\n8  The Xian-Hefei railway, funded by ADB, will pass through the project area.  In May 2000, the World Bank approved\n\n$150 million for a highway project to the southeast of the project area.\n\n9    PADO  exists  at  national,  provincial,  prefecture,  and  county  levels,  and  reports  to  the  Leading  Group  Office  on\nPoverty Alleviation and Development at the national and provincial levels, which in turn are under the leadership of\nthe State Council\u2019s Leading Group on Poverty Alleviation and Development.  The national PADO is located in the\nMinistry  of  Agriculture.  Under  provincial  government  restructuring,  PADO  may  be  renamed  as  Integrated\nAgricultural Development Office.\n\n10    Recovery  rates  from  farm  households  are  typically  over  70  percent  (although  local  officials  claim  higher  rates),\nwhile  loans  to  TVEs  and  county-owned  enterprises  (which  was  the  policy  during  1990-1996)  had  much  lower\nrepayment rates (typically under 20 percent).\n\n11 TA  2214-PRC: Cooperative Banking Development, for $600,000, approved on 1 December 1994.\n\n\f5\n\naverage  loan  size  of  RCCs  is  much  smaller  than  ABC  loans,  but  the  number  of  borrowers\nserved is much larger.\n\n15.\nAdditional sources of credit in Henan include the Mutual Aid Fund for Disaster Relief and\nPoverty Alleviation (established under the Civil Affairs Department), Individual Laborer\u2019s Mutual\nAid  Fund  under  the  Industry  and  Commerce  Department,  and  Supply  and  Marketing\nCooperative  (SMC)  Share  Service.    In  a  1997  review,  one  county  in  West  Henan  had  246\nregistered  NBFIs,  although  the  actual  number  operating  was  much  higher.    Most  of  the  loans\noffered by these institutions are less than Y5,000, with maturities of less than six months, and\nhighly  variable  interest  rates.  Most  NBFIs  in  rural  areas  have  low  operating  costs,  do  not  pay\ntaxes,  and  offer  high  interest  rates  on  deposits  (although  officially  prohibited)  and  hence  have\ngrown quite rapidly in recent years, often attracting deposits from the official banking sector.\n\n16.\nAgricultural  research  services  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Henan  Academy  of\nAgricultural  Sciences  (HAAS),  which  operates  12  specialized  commodity  institutes,  a  well-\nequipped central research laboratory, and the Agricultural Science and Technology Information\nInstitute.12  At the field level, there are 17 research stations and 32 experimental stations. HAAS\nruns  a  comprehensive  program  on  breeding,  agronomy,  crop  production,  soil  fertility,  and\nintegrated pest management, and has achieved notable successes in breeding wheat, corn, and\npeanut  varieties.  The  Henan  Agricultural  University  (HAU)  also  plays  an  important  role  in\nresearch  and  breeding  programs.    For  livestock,  HAU  and  HAAS  have  comprehensive\nprograms  on  disease  control,  animal  breeding,  animal  husbandry,  and  fodder  production.\nLimited operational budgets are a key constraint in research activities.13  With the progressive\nimplementation  of  market  reforms,  some  research  units  began  undertaking  semi-commercial\nseed  multiplication,  feed  milling,  and  crop  production  in  the  1990s  to  help  generate  research\nfunds.\n\n17.\nExtension  services  at  the  provincial,  prefecture,  county,  and  township  levels  are\nprovided  for  agriculture,  forestry,  horticulture,  livestock,  and  aquaculture  by  the  relevant  line\nagencies.  Each  agency  maintains  at  the  township  level  a  technical  station  that  trains  and\nsupervises  the  part-time  farmer  technicians  who  work  at  the  village  level.  The  townships  fund\nthe technical stations. The level of funding and the quantity and quality of service depend on the\nability of the townships to pay. At the township, the ratio of technicians to farmers for horticulture\nis about 1:2,100, which improves to 1:318 when the part-time farmer technicians are included.14\nThe corresponding figures for livestock are 1:1,800 and 1:300, respectively. A major inadequacy\nin extension is the insufficient training, of technician and key farmers, to take full advantage of\ncurrent research results and convey this information to farmers with practical advice.\n\n18.\nNongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are  progressively  being  established  throughout\nthe PRC, and provide alternative sources of assistance to the rural poor in Henan.  Funding the\nPoor Cooperatives have been established at county and township levels in several experimental\nareas, to motivate qualified poor people to form small groups, deliver loans to members through\nsmall groups and centers, organize activities such as training and extension, collect due loans,\n\n                  \n\n12 ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, especially for\nlivestock and horticulture is generating results that are relevant to the PRC and Henan (e.g. TA 5812-REG: Third\nAgriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR Centers \u2013 Increasing Productivity of Crop-Livestock\nSystems in Asia (International Livestock Research Institute), for $1,000,000, approved on 1 October 1998).\n\n13  TA  3446-PRC: Study of Funding Options for Agricultural Research in PRC,  for  $150,000,  approved  on  25  May\n\n14  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  uses  a  guideline  of  1:500  as  a  satisfactory\n\n2000.\n\nlevel of full-time staffing.\n\n\f6\n\nand  monitor  the  working  of  the  groups  and  centers.    One  of  two  pilot  microfinance  schemes\nundertaken  in  Henan,  was  in  the  project  area,  in  Nanzhao  County.  Though  no  specific\norganization has been established in Henan, the Program of Happiness has operated projects\nin  two  poor  counties  to  help  poor  mothers  escape  poverty.  Project  Hope  has  been  a  very\ninfluential  poverty-related  activity  organized  by  the  Communist  Youth  League.    From  1990  to\n1999, Project Hope in Henan raised about Y100 million and helped 96,377 child dropouts return\nto  school.  The  Henan  Women\u2019s  Federation  has  organized  7,495  poor  households  in  21  poor\ncounties to operate microfinance-based income-generating activities. Another important activity\norganized  by  the  Women's  Federation  is  the  Spring  Bud  Plan  to  help  girl  dropouts  return  to\nschool.    In  the  past  six  years,  this  plan  has  raised  Y13.48  million  and  helped  65,000  girl\ndropouts  return  to  schools.  The  Brilliant  Cause  was  started  in  July  1994  in  Henan  to  promote\nthe  participation  of  private  enterprises  and  other  non-State-owned  enterprises  in  the  cause  of\npoverty reduction.\n\n4.\n\nRecent Economic Development in Henan\n\nDespite  being  a  poor  interior  province,  Henan  has  actively  implemented  the  national\n19.\neconomic reforms. Provincial GDP grew at an annual average rate of 10.9 percent during 1979-\n1998\u2014about  equal  to  the  national  growth  rate\u2014and  currently  stands  at  Y4,712  per  capita,\nranking 18th in the PRC. GDP growth was led by services, industry, and agriculture, which grew\nat  14.5  percent,  12.8  percent,  and  6.2  percent,  respectively.  In  1998,  real  GDP  grew  by  8.7\npercent, reaching Y435.7 billion ($52.5 billion) with output from agriculture reaching Y107 billion\n($12.9 billion). The rapid economic growth resulted in significant income increases for both rural\nand urban populations.  Since 1995, the growth rates in agricultural GVO (9 percent) and GDP\n(10 percent) in Henan have exceeded the national averages (5 percent, 8 percent).\n\n20.\nAs in other agriculture-based interior provinces, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Henan\nhas  been  modest  compared  with  that  in  coastal  provinces.  During  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan\n(1991-1995), FDI in the province totaled $1.4 billion. In 1998, it was $618 million. Most FDI is in\nthe  industry  and  construction  sectors  and  only  a  small  amount  is  channeled  to  agriculture.  To\nincrease FDI in agriculture and the rural areas and to achieve a better balance between urban\nand rural economic growth, the province is actively considering further incentives in the areas of\nland-use rights, land-use fees, income tax concessions, and agroprocessing.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nAgriculture\n\n21.\nThe Government\u2019s medium-term sector objectives are to (i) increase food production to\nmeet  the  increase  in  demand  resulting  from  the  growth  in  population  and  income,  and  (ii)\nincrease rural incomes and employment opportunities to check the widening rural-urban income\ndisparities.  Given  the  arable  land  constraints  (0.1  ha  per  capita)  in  the  PRC,  the  sector\ndevelopment  strategy  focuses  on  increasing  productivity,  developing  underutilized  and\nunutilized  lands,  crop  diversification,  and  adopting  an  integrated  approach  to  farming.  The\nstrategy  also  seeks  to  increase  value  added  for  agricultural  produce  and  to  create  off-farm\nemployment opportunities.\n\n\f7\n\nThe  Ninth  Five  Year  Plan  (NYFP  -  1996-2000)  identified  agricultural  development  as\n22.\nPRC\u2019s top priority.15 The key elements of the agricultural development plan include (i) protecting\narable  land  from  urban/industrial  encroachment  and  desertification;  (ii)  improving  agricultural\nproduction  technologies;  (iii)  improving  support  services  and  delivery  of  inputs  and  market\ninformation;  (iv)  enhancing  rural  infrastructure  including  irrigation,  drainage  facilities,  water\nsupply,  and  roads;  (v)  improving  postharvest  handling,  storage,  and  distribution  facilities;  (vi)\nintegrating  crop  production  with  forestry,  livestock,  and  aquaculture;  (vii)  providing  production\nincentives to farmers by deepening agricultural reforms; and (viii) creating off-farm employment\nopportunities through the development of rural agroprocessing industries. The NYFP envisaged\na substantial increase in investments in agriculture and rural development, to be met through an\nincrease in the appropriations from the Government budget, supplemented by external funding.\nIn  1998,  the  Government  committed  itself  to  major  increases  in  investment  in  forestry,  water\nconservation,  and  poverty  relief  in  rural  areas.  In  1999,  it  affirmed  its  commitment  to\ndevelopment  in  the  interior  provinces,  with  focus  on  providing  infrastructure  and  improving\nnatural resources management, to overcome an emerging prosperity gap between coastal and\ninterior regions.  At the crossroads between east and west, north and south in the PRC, Henan\nstands to benefit indirectly from the Government plan to accelerate development in the western\nprovinces over the next decade.\n\n23.\nTo  reduce  rural  poverty,  Henan  has  focused  its  agricultural  and  rural  development\nassistance  on  the  following  programs:  (i)  intensifying  lowland  agriculture,  particularly  grain\nproduction, through increased investment in rural infrastructure and improved support services;\n(ii) promoting sustainable agricultural development for poor communities in uplands, by adopting\nsoil  conservation  measures  and  diversifying  crop  production;  (iii)  improving  postharvest\nhandling, storage, and marketing of both grain and nongrain produce; and (iv) promoting rural\nindustries  to  generate  off-farm  employment  opportunities  for  poor  rural  communities  and\nsupporting downstream processing facilities.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n24.\nPRC\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  program  was  introduced  in  1985.  The  program  was\ndesigned  to  attack  absolute  poverty  and  set  an  official  poverty  line  at  an  annual  average  per\ncapita  net  income  of  Y150  ($18)  and  a  grain  ration  of  200  kilograms.  The  Seventh  Five-Year\nPlan (1986-1990) incorporated explicit poverty reduction measures for poverty counties through\nincome  generation,  relief  aid,  preferential  taxes,  and  targeted  assistance  based  on  income\ncriteria. The program identified 328 poverty counties for national Government assistance. Since\n1985,  progress  in  reducing  poverty  has  been  substantial.  The  number  of  people  classified  as\nabsolute  poor  declined  from  125  million  in  1985  to  80  million  in  1993.  In  July  1993,  the\nGovernment  initiated  the  Eight-Seven  Poverty  Alleviation  Campaign  to  lift  the  80  million\nabsolute poor above the poverty line during the remaining seven years of the century.\n\n25.\nThe majority of the poor live in rural areas, mostly in areas with limited natural resources,\npoor  agricultural  land,  limited  off-farm  employment  opportunities,  and  inadequate  physical  and\nsocial  infrastructure.  The  strategic  thrust  of  the  poverty  alleviation  campaign  was  to  promote\nintegrated  socioeconomic  development  and  human  resource  development  in  areas  where  the\npoor are concentrated. The campaign has been successful and the number of the absolute poor\n\n                  \n\n15  The  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (2001-2005)  will  continue  this  emphasis,  as  the  Government  is  concerned  about\nemerging  disparities  between  coastal  and  interior  areas  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas.    The  Tenth  Plan\nperiod  will  see  major  Government  investment  in  the  western  portion  of  the  PRC.  Through  its  location  at  the\ncrossroads of the national transportation system, Henan stands to benefit indirectly from this investment.\n\n\f8\n\nat the end of 1999 was estimated at about 34 million. It is recognized that about 20 million will\nremain very difficult to reach under existing programs by the end of 2000.  The Tenth Five-Year\nPlan  (2001-2005)  will  continue  to  emphasize  poverty  reduction.  The  central  Government  is\ncurrently mapping out a poverty reduction and development program that targets western PRC,\nInfrastructure  construction,\nethnic  minority  areas,  and  regions \nenvironmental  protection,  and  social  infrastructure  (health,  education,  housing)  will  be  priority\nprojects for the impoverished areas.\n\nin  resources. \n\nlacking \n\n \n\n26. While  national  attempts  to  assist  the  absolute  poor  have  been  successful,  the  narrow\nincome definition of the national poverty line (about $0.66 per day on a purchasing power parity\nbasis) does not take account of poverty\u2019s wider characteristics.  Adoption of a wider definition\nrequires,  in  addition  to  income,  attention  to  education,  gender  equality,  infant  and  maternal\nmortality,  health  care,  housing,  and  environmental  sustainability.  A  logical  next  step  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s drive to eliminate rural poverty would entail recognition of relative income poverty\nand a commensurate shift in the poverty line, to the international standard of $1 per day or the\nbottom 10 percent of the population in terms of income (both currently around Y1,000 per capita\nper  annum).16    Estimates  for  the  year  2000  indicate  that  106  million  people  fall  below  this\npoverty line; therefore the task of reducing poverty remains substantial.\n\n27.\nAt the international poverty line of $1 per day per person (adjusted for purchasing power\nparity), the incidence of poverty in Henan was 13 percent in 1997, with about 10 million people\nbelow  this  line  (more  than  2.5  times  the  absolute  poverty  incidence).  In  1998,  this  proportion\nwas reduced slightly to 11.2 percent of the population (10.5 million people). About half of these\npoor  families  live  in  West  Henan.  The  poverty  threshold  is  marginally  above  the  basic  grain\nrequirements,  so  many  households  with  incomes  above  it  still  lack  basic  livelihood  needs  and\nmay slide back to poverty in a bad crop year or after natural disasters.\n\n28.\nPreviously,  most  of  the  poor  in  Henan  were  located  in  the  28  officially  designated\nnational poverty counties, including the 12 poor counties in West Henan (see map), as well as\nsix province-designated poverty counties. Due to the success of the poverty reduction program,\nhowever, nonpoverty counties now have 47.6 percent of the total absolute poor rural population\nin  Henan  (an  increase  from  31.3  percent  in  1993).  Even  in  the  poorer  western  counties  of\nHenan,  substantial  differences  in  the  incidence  of  relative  poverty  occur\u2014from  23  percent  in\nSongxian to 1 percent in Mianchi. The majority of the poor counties are concentrated in difficult\nareas: high mountains, dry rolling hills, waterlogged gullies, sandbanks of Yellow River basins,\nand  regions  of  endemic  diseases  such  as  goiter.  The  province  is  placing  priority  on  removing\nthese pockets of rural poverty, using more location-specific criteria in determining development\npriorities and targeting development assistance at poor village and household levels. Since the\nearly  1980s,  designated  poverty  counties  have  received  about  Y5  billion  in  poverty  reduction\nfunds. In 1998, new programs were developed to target poor households in nonpoor counties.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n29.\nAt the end of 1997, 7,896 foreign-funded agriculture projects sector in the PRC, involved\n$12  billion  in  foreign  capital  (Appendix  1).  Since  1985,  the  World  Bank,  the  main  source  of\nexternal  assistance  to  agriculture,  has  provided  11  loans  amounting  to  $250  million  for\nagriculture projects covering Henan Province for (i) land development, irrigation, and drainage;\n(ii)  agriculture  support  service  improvement;  (iii)  development  of  specialized  subsectors,\n\n                  \n\n16  Emerging  urban  poverty  suggests  that  $3  per  day  in  coastal  cities  and  $2  per  day  in  interior  cities  may  be\n\nappropriate urban poverty lines, pending additional study by ADB.\n\n\f9\n\nincluding  forestry,  livestock,  and  horticulture;  and  (iv)  area  development  projects.  All  of  the\nWorld  Bank  lending  to  agriculture  and  rural  development  has  used  concessional  funds  under\nthe  International  Development  Association  (IDA).  The  World  Bank  has  successfully  supported\nprovince-level  multicomponent  area  development  projects,  aimed  partly  at  poverty  reduction,\nwhich were prepared and implemented by local governments.\n\n30.\nThe latter category of projects includes the $110 million Henan Agricultural Development\nProject (HADP), which commenced in May 1991 and was completed in 1999.  HADP covered\n20 counties in the northern and eastern part of Henan (along the Yellow River) and comprised\n11 agroprocessing plants, 16 seed processing plants, and livestock and horticulture. The World\nBank  evaluated  project  progress  and  presented  to  the  project  to  other  provinces  as  a  model.\nThe  accounting  system  of  the  World  Bank  project  was  extended  to  other  provinces,  and  the\nProject  Management  Office  (PMO)  was  praised  for  its  efficiency  and  professionalism.  The\nproject  completion  report  noted  project  success  for  all  components,  with  greenhouses  and\nlivestock  exceeding  the  targets.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  at\n40 percent, compared with 35.8 percent at appraisal.\n\n31.\nThroughout  the  PRC,  the  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  Development  (IFAD)  has\nsupported  six  projects  for  $161  million,  and  the  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has\nimplemented  11  projects  for  $174  million.  In  Henan,  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of\nthe  United  Nations  (FAO)  completed  two  fruit  processing  projects  with  a  total  investment  of\n$15.1  million,  and  WFP  funded  a  farmland  rehabilitation  project,  with  investments  of  $16.6\nmillion.\n\nJapan  previously  provided \n\nInternational\nforeign  assistance \n32.\nCooperation  Agency  (JICA,  for  TAs)  and  the  former  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund\n(OECF,  for  loans).  In  Henan,  JICA  supported  a  project  for  the  rehabilitation  of  rice  fields  ($3\nmillion). A fruit processing project in the province was financed by a Japanese NGO. Germany\u2019s\ndevelopment  assistance  to  the  PRC  is  mainly  related  to  environment/forestry  and  one  project\ntargets  poverty  reduction  in  Henan.  The  Netherlands  is  assisting  the  province  with  a  livestock\nproject focused on dairy cattle.  The United Kingdom financed a $7.1 million duck raising project\nin the province.\n\nthe  Japan \n\nthrough \n\n33.\nADB\u2019s operation in the agriculture sector in the PRC commenced in 1988. To date, ADB\nhas provided $779.6 million to finance eight projects (10 loans). The loans were complemented\nby  53  TAs  totaling  $31  million  for  institutional  strengthening,  enterprise  reform,  environmental\nmanagement,  poverty  reduction,  and  project  preparation.  This  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first\nagricultural project in Henan Province.\n\n D.\n\nGovernance and Lessons Learned\n\n34.\nThe  PRC  has  demonstrated  strong  project  implementation  capability.    Most  projects  in\nADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio  have  been  implemented  efficiently,  with  some  completed  ahead  of\nschedule.  There  is  a  strong  sense  of  project  ownership  at  local  levels  and  consequent\ncommitment to effective implementation. Other factors that have contributed to efficient project\nimplementation include (i) rigorous screening of projects proposed for ADB assistance to ensure\nfinancial  viability,  debt  servicing  capability,  and  adequate  provision  of  counterpart  funds;  (ii)\neffective  interagency  coordination;  (iii)  well-developed  institutional  arrangements  for  project\nimplementation; (iv) good technical skills in the EAs; and (v) strong emphasis on anticorruption\nat  all  levels  of  government.  The  strategic  use  of  TA  to  upgrade  the  capabilities  of  EAs  and\n\n\f10\n\nholding of seminars and workshops to familiarize EA staff with ADB\u2019s procedures and practices\nhave also contributed to good project quality.\n\n35.\nDespite  this  overall  satisfactory  performance,  the  performance  of  individual  projects  in\nthe agriculture sector has been mixed.  Of the eight ADB-assisted agriculture projects, two (ABC\nand  Hexian  pulpmill)  have  been  completed  and  postevaluated,  four  are  at  various  stages  of\nimplementation  (Guangdong  tropical  crops,  Yunnan-Simao  forestation  and  sustainable  wood\nutilization, ABC II, and Fujian soil conservation and rural development), one  (Hainan agriculture\nand natural resources development) may be canceled, and one (North China marine culture and\ncoastal  resources  management)  lapsed  before  effectiveness  due  to  closure  of  the  financial\nintermediary.\n\nPostevaluation of the ABC project concluded that the project was generally successful,\n36.\nachieved its objectives, and was efficiently implemented. Two projects (Hainan and North China\nmarine  culture)  demonstrated  that  institutional  arrangements  need  to  be  carefully  worked  out\nand  the  financial  performance  and  viability  of  financial  intermediaries  must  be  carefully\nassessed.  The Hexian pulpmill project, completed in October 1994, demonstrates the need to\ncarefully assess production targets, quality goals, and financial viability. The project was ranked\nunsuccessful  during  postevaluation.  The  problems  can  be  attributed  to  some  technical  errors\nand  omissions  in  the  process  design,  using  a  technology  that  was  relatively  new  in  the  PRC,\nand  inadequate  arrangements  for  transfer  of  the  process  technology.17  Yunnan-Simao  is\nexperiencing serious implementation difficulties, which confirm the need to carefully assess the\neconomic viability and sustainability of the project benefits for State-sponsored agroprocessing\nenterprises.\n\n37.\nThe  1998  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  report  for  the  PRC  found  that  ADB\noperations  in  the  agriculture  sector  over  the  period  1986-1997  had  not  achieved  significant\nperformance  in  relation  to  the  strategic  sectoral  objectives  espoused  in  the  1991  Country\nOperational Strategy. Less than satisfactory performance appears to be associated with State-\nowned  agroprocessing  industries,18  where  the  Government  engaged  in  directed  lending  and\nattempted  to  pick  winners  in  a  rapidly  changing  sector,  that  is  increasingly  exposed  to\ninternational competition.  Projects that promoted direct Government investment in agricultural\nproduction  and  private  sector  involvement  in  downstream  processing  (such  as  Fujian  and\nGuangdong tropical crops) were more successful. These lessons have been incorporated in the\ndesign of subsequent projects, including the proposed Project, which is partly modeled on the\nFujian soil conservation and rural development project.19\n\nSeveral  World  Bank  postcompletion  reviews  of  agriculture  projects20  have  also  been\n38.\ndrawn upon for lessons learned to be applied in the project design. The projects reviewed are\nmulticomponent projects implemented in many counties and in more than one province, and are\ntherefore  similar  to  the  proposed  Project  in  design.  The  postcompletion  reviews  do  not  cite\n\n                  \n\napproved on 24 May 1996.\n\n17 These problems were partly addressed under TA 2574-PRC: Capacity Building for Hexian Pulpmill, for $600,000,\n\n18 For  these  reasons,  an  agroprocessing  component  that  would  have  supported  19  agroprocessing  plants  was\n\ndeleted from the project scope during processing.\n\n19 The main similarities are funding through relevant line agencies, terracing and soil conservation measures prior to\n\nestablishing tree crops in sloping areas, and strong linkages with provincial research and extension systems.\n\n20 Credit 1261-CHA: North China Plain Agricultural Development Project, Impact Evaluation Report, June 1994 and\nPAR No.7736, April 1989; Loan 2579-CHA: Pishihang-Chaohu Area Development Project, PCR Report No.12013,\nJuly 1993; Credit 1733-CHA: Red Soil Area Development Project, PAR No.12033, June 1993 and PCR No.11691,\nFebruary  1993;  and  Loan  2261-CHA  and  Credit  1347-CHA:  Heilongjiang  Land  Reclamation  Project,  PAR  No.\n10657, May 1992.\n\n\f11\n\ncomplexity  of  multicomponent  and  multilocation  projects  as  a  significant  problem,  largely\nbecause  of  strong  commitment  from  local  levels,  strong  project  management  offices  at\nprovincial  levels,  and  the  active  participation  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  findings,  however,\nhighlight a need for (i) flexibility in project design to respond to site-specific technical problems\nand  rapid  market  changes,  and  (ii)  specific  measures  to  ensure  poverty  reduction  impacts  by\nproviding increased extension and support to farmers.\n\n39.\nThe  implementation  completion  report  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  HADP  found  that  an\nintegrated  system  linking  production,  processing,  and  marketing  was  the  cornerstone  of  the\nproject\u2019s  success.  The  model  of  linking  companies  to  farm  households  benefited  both  parties\nand reduced market risks. Introduction of advanced technologies enabled products to compete\nsuccessfully in the marketplace. On average, farmer net per capita income increased from Y550\nto  Y2,179  in  the  project  area  an  annual  growth  rate  of  25.8  percent,  compared  with  the\nprovincial average of 21.5 percent over the same period.  It was noted, however, that several of\nthe  agroprocessing  plants  were  running  into  difficulty  in  obtaining  adequate  operating  funds,\nthus raising questions of sustainability.\n\n40.\nThe  Project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  took  these  findings  into  account\nand provide for (i) a midterm review of the Project to assess implementation status, review the\nproject parameters, and take appropriate measures to ensure achievement of the objectives; (ii)\nstrengthening of extension services and training; (iii) beneficiary selection criteria giving priority\nto the poorer members of the local community; (iv) structuring assistance packages so that they\nare attractive and affordable to poor households, and allow them to progressively expand their\nfarm  operations  through  repeat  lending;  and  (v)  pilot  testing  the  company  +  household\nenterprise  model  as  a  potential  model  for  future  lending  in  the  sector,  rather  than  the\ncornerstone of the Project as originally envisaged.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n\n41.\nADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  is  poverty  reduction.  In  pursuit  of  this  objective,  ADB\u2019s\noperational  strategy  for  the  PRC  emphasizes  three  broad  objectives:  (i)  improving  economic\nefficiency,  (ii)  promoting  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  inland  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhancing\nenvironmental  protection  and  natural  resources  management.  For  agriculture,  the  country\noperational  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  increasing  efficiency  in  agricultural  production,  processing,\nand  marketing;  (ii)  reducing  rural  poverty  and  increasing  rural  income  opportunities  through\ncash  crops  and  off-farm  employment;  (iii)  improving  management  and  development  of  soil,\nwater, forest, and marine resources for sustainable development; (iv) supporting the transition to\na market economy through improved incentives for private sector investment and establishment\nof market information systems; and (v) supporting enterprise reforms.\n\nAgricultural projects are also designed to simultaneously address crosscutting concerns,\n42.\nparticularly  poverty  reduction,  improving  natural  resource  management,  and  environmental\nprotection.    ADB\u2019s  operations  are  designed  to  help  reduce  the  disparity  in  incomes  between\nrural  and  urban  areas  by  facilitating  the  development  of  efficient  markets  in  agricultural  goods\nand  improving  incentives  for  agricultural  production,  including  improved  land  tenure  and\ntransfer.\n\n43.\nMost of PRC\u2019s poor live in resource-constrained inland provinces like Henan, which have\nnot  received  the  special  incentives  provided  to  coastal  provinces  to  accelerate  economic\ngrowth.  Instead  of  encouraging  preferential  incentives  that  tend  to  exacerbate  or  create  new\nfactor market distortion and misallocation of resources, ADB\u2019s strategic thrust to reduce poverty\n\n\f12\n\nin  inland  provinces  is  to  help  (i)  promote  market-based  policy  changes  to  attract  more  foreign\nand  domestic  investments;  (ii)  address  infrastructure  and  institutional  constraints  to  rural\ndevelopment;  (iii)  develop  integrated  agriculture  and  agrobased  industries;  (iv)  develop\ntransportation, communications, and marketing linkages between the interior provinces and the\ncoast;  and  (v)  locate  development  projects  in  poverty  counties  or  in  areas  where  the  average\nincome is well below the national average (and below the $1 per day poverty line).\n\n F.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1.\n\nLand Use and Land Tenure Reform\n\n44.\nA  critical  factor  in  rural  poverty  reduction  is  access  to  adequate  land  resources.    Land\nuse and land tenure in Henan are covered by the provincial regulations within the broad policy\nframework  of  the  national  Government.21  Accordingly,  an  important  step  in  reducing  rural\npoverty  is  reform  of  the  legal  framework  covering  land  use  and  land  tenure.22  The  Land\nAdministration Law, drafted with ADB assistance, became effective on 1 January 1999. The law\nprovides for a national land use plan, which will stipulate the total amount of arable land to be\nput  under  protection.  After  the  State  Council  approves  this  plan,  every  province,  county  and\ntownship  will  be  assigned  quotas  of  arable  land  for  protection.  The  area  of  cultivated  land\nshould comprise more than 80 percent of the arable land. Any arable land that is unavoidably\nrequired  for  urban/industrial  expansion  must  be  replaced  by  a  similar  area  of  wasteland\nreclaimed by the project proponent. Each local government area will be required to work out its\nown plans to protect arable land, with standards no less strict than those set by the State.\n\nADB assisted Sichuan Province to draft a model enabling provincial law,23 which could\n45.\nbe applied nationwide, and the findings were discussed with PGH. The new Sichuan land law\nmakes  changes  in  four  significant  areas:  (i)  registration  of  land  rights  and  issuance  of\ncertificates by which landholders can confirm their rights against intrusions by other landholders\nand  claimants,  and  against  arbitrary  actions  by  State  or  local  agencies;  (ii)  local  government\nresponsibilities to prepare the overall land use plans, with plans prepared by one level of local\ngovernment and submitted to the next higher level for approval; (iii) formulas for payments for\nrural land undergoing conversion to urban construction land, based on the measurement of the\nproductivity  of  the  rural  land  being  acquired,  and  full  compensation  for  collective  farm\norganizations and individual families; and (iv) citizen participation in the processes of land use\nplanning and in the procedures for conversion of rural land to urban uses. A national supervision\nand inspection system for land resources and land occupation will be set up under the Ministry\nof Land and Resources. PGH has prepared implementing guidelines for the Land Administration\nLaw,  which  are  similar  to  those  prepared  for  Sichuan  Province.  Under  the  Project,  a  specific\ncovenant  ensures  that  tree  crops  are  not  established  on  protected  arable  land,  cultivation  will\nnot be permitted on slopes greater than 25 degrees, and long-term leases will be assured for all\nbeneficiaries (30-50 years, depending on type of crop and land quality).\n\n                  \n\n21 ADB assistance has been provided under TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for\n$800,000, approved on 24 December 1996. At the provincial level, land use and tenure were addressed under TA\n2408-PRC: Land Use and Land Use Tenure Policy in Fujian Province,  for  $600,000  approved  on  28  September\n1995.\n\n22 The  need  for  a  transparent  land  title  registration  system  is  one  of  the  lessons  of  the  Hainan  Agriculture  Project.\nUnder that project, one of the problems was the difficulty ascertaining the legal ownership of the assets claimed by\nthe implementing agencies.\n\n23 TA  3123-PRC:  Provincial  Legislation  on  Environmental  Protection  and  Natural  Resources  Conservation,  for\n\n$300,000, approved on 15 December 1998.\n\n\f13\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n46.\nThe  nature  of  poverty  in  the  PRC  is  changing,  with  large  income  gaps  opening  up\nbetween rural and urban areas, and with many of the remaining absolute poor living in remote\nmountainous  areas,  where  provision  of  adequate  infrastructure  is  uneconomic  and  delivery  of\nsocial  services  is  difficult.24    Also,  with  the  restructuring  of  inefficient  State-owned  enterprises\n(SOEs), there is an emerging class of urban poor, which is potentially destabilizing and, hence,\nis  attracting  increased  attention  through  provision  of  an  adequate  social  safety  net.    The\nGovernment  had  previously  opted  not  to  make  extensive  use  of  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources  (OCR)  funds  for  poverty  reduction,  arguing  that  financial  returns  should  be  high,\nrelatively  short  term,  and  capable  of  full  cost  recovery  with  a  premium  to  cover  market  and\nforeign  exchange  risks.    The  previous  availability  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  IDA  concessional\nresources led the Government to be less inclined to use ADB\u2019s OCR resources in agriculture.\nAccordingly,  a  major  aspect  of  the  policy  dialogue  was  to  reach  an  understanding  with  the\nGovernment  that  ADB\u2019s  OCR  resources  could  be  applied  successfully  to  poverty  reduction\nprojects in the PRC.\n\n47.\nDespite  its  status  as  a  poor  province,  Henan  has  been  paying  much  attention  to  the\nsocial  security  of  rural  dwellers  by  providing  access  roads  to  poor  villages;  promoting  applied\ntechnologies in poor areas to increase incomes; providing special funds for children who have\ndropped out of school; and providing vocational, technical, and skills training in poor areas.  The\ncommitment to rural infrastructure in poor areas is consistent with the policy dialogue conducted\nunder  TA  3150-PRC  (footnote  3),  which  emphasized  that  provision  of  roads  in  rural  areas\n(carefully bundled with other essential services) is one of the most effective means of combating\npoverty  by  providing  poor  farmers  with  access  to  markets  as  well  as  to  social  services.    As  a\nresult  of  this  policy  dialogue  with  PGH,  the  project  design  has  focused  on  targeting  the  poor,\nand  the  involved  Government  agencies  are  now  eager  to  demonstrate  that  ADB\u2019s  OCR  funds\ncan also be used for poverty reduction.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Protection\n\n48.\nThe economic loss attributable to pollution and associated degradation of PRC\u2019s natural\nresources is estimated at between 3.5 and 7.7 percent of GDP. Environmental improvement has\nbeen  a  constant  item  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  agenda  for  the  PRC.  ADB  has  provided  TA  for\nstrengthening the institutional capacities of the Government agencies responsible for assessing\nand  monitoring  environmental  impacts  and  formulating  environmental  protection  laws.25  ADB\n\n                  \n\n24 In 1997, the income ratio between the 10 percent of households with the highest income and the lowest 5 percent\nof  financially  stressed  families  in  PRC's  cities  and  towns  was  4.7:1.  In  the  same  year,  5  percent  of  the  rural\nhouseholds had an average per capita annual net income of over Y5,000, while 4.4 percent had less than Y600 per\ncapita.  The  ratio  between  the  5  percent  of  rural  residents  at  the  upper  level  and  5  percent  of  those  at  the  lower\nlevel was about 8.3:1.\n\n25 TA 987-PRC: Institutional Strengthening of the National Environmental Protection Agency, for $340,000, approved\non June 1988; TA 1436-PRC: Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Training, for 600,000, approved on 10\nDecember  1990;  TA  1988-PRC: EIA Training Phase II,  for  $900,000,  approved  on  18  November  1993;  and  TA\n2090-PRC: Legislative Reform for Protecting the Environment and Natural Resources, for $500,000, approved on\n18  May  1994;  TA  2975-PRC:  Environmental Impact Assessment Training and Curriculum Development,  for\n$600,000, approved on 31 December 1997; TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and\nNatural Resources Conservation,  for $300,000, approved on 15 December 1998; TA 3290-PRC: Capacity Building\nin Ministerial Status Responsibilities in State Environmental Protection Administration, for $810,000, approved on 8\nNovember 1999.\n\n\f14\n\nhas  also  provided  TA  for  soil  and  water  conservation,  forest  and  grassland  ecosystems\nconservation, and agro-industrial pollution control.26\n\n49.\nThe  major  environmental  concerns  in  Henan  are  soil  and  water  conservation  and\nindustrial  pollution.  The  province,  with  the  assistance  of  the  national  Government,  has  been\nimplementing various measures for soil and water conservation, particularly in the Yellow River\ncatchment  and  the  loess27  areas.  The  horticulture  component  of  the  proposed  Project  will\ncontribute to the ongoing efforts to conserve soil and water in the loess region.\n\nThe TA on efficient utilization of agricultural wastes28 reflects conclusions from the study\n50.\non rural energy development,29 which was completed in 1996, and the TA for renewable energy\ndevelopment.30 These two TAs recommended an integrated agricultural development approach\nto  improve  the  environment  and  livelihood  of  farm  households  in  rural  PRC  through  more\nefficient  utilization  of  agricultural  waste  products  to  produce  low-cost  and  cleaner  energy\nsources,  and  improve  agricultural  production.  Utilization  of  agricultural  wastes  has  been\nincorporated into the livestock component of the Project, through use of ammoniated straw as\nlivestock feed, and use of piggery wastes to generate methane for heating in winter.\n\n51.\nPGH  has  been  very  serious  in  combating  industrial  pollution.  Thousands  of  small  and\nmedium-size  polluting  industrial  enterprises  were  closed  and  many  medium-size  and  large\nindustries  paid  penalties.  Policy  dialogue  during  project  design  resulted  in  the  assurance  that\nindustrial  units  to  benefit  from  the  water  supply  subcomponent  will  be  connected  only  if  they\nmeet  the  national  standards  for  industrial  emission,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste\ndisposal. It was also agreed that polluting industries upstream of the regulating reservoir would\nbe closed to protect the quality of the stored water and reduce treatment costs.\n\n4.\n\nWater Tariff Rationalization\n\nThe  continued  strong  growth  of  the  economy  has  caused  water  demand  to  outstrip\n52.\nsupply in most parts of the PRC, especially along the Yellow River, where the Project is located.\nThe  gap  between  demand  and  supply  is  widening,  and  the  situation  is  exacerbated  by  the\noverall  shortage  of  freshwater  sources  in  many  regions  and  the  inefficient  use  of  water,\nparticularly  in  agriculture.  It  is  increasingly  recognized  that  financing  of  water  supply  schemes\nand  pricing  of  water  need  to  be  changed  to  generate  funds  for  subsequent  investment\nrequirements,  provide  market-based  incentives  to  effectively  manage  water  demands,  and\nprovide incentives for commercially oriented water companies to improve their efficiency. ADB\nhas  funded  TA31  for  formulating  appropriate  guidelines  and  policies  in  the  water  sector,  which\nhave led to the adoption of National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT) and mechanisms for\ntheir  implementation,  and  is  continuing  assistance  in  this  area.  Major  TA  recommendations\nreflected in the NGWT include (i) selection of a tariff structure based on local conditions; (ii) a\ntwo-part tariff with a volumetric and fixed demand charge; (iii) adoption of full cost recovery as\n\n                  \n\n26 TA 2073-PRC: Chang Jiang Soil and Water Conservation and Environmental  Protection, for $600,000, approved\non 24 March 1994; TA 2119-PRC: Forest  Ecosystem Planning and Agro-industrial Pollution Control, for $600,000,\napproved  on  30  June  1994;  TA  2156-PRC: Improvement of Grassland Ecosystem in North China,  for  $746,000,\napproved  on  16  September  1994;  and  TA  2407-PRC:  Capacity Building for Soil and Water Conservation,  for\n$590,000, approved on 28 September 1995.\n\n27 Loess is yellowish brown loamy soil, usually unstratified and prone to rain and wind erosion.\n28 TA 3370-PRC: Efficient Use of Agricultural Wastes, for $703,000, approved on 26 December 1999.\n29 TA 2100-PRC:Rural Energy Development Study, for $500,000, approved on 16 June 1994.\n30 TA 3056-PRC:Renewable Energy Development, for $656,000, approved 19 August 1998.\n31 TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997, and TA 2773\u2013\n\nPRC: Water Supply Tariff Study, for $600,000, approved on 24  March 1997.\n\n\f15\n\nthe main objective in setting and approving tariff levels; and (iv) adoption of a simplified process\nfor tariff regulation, requiring evaluation and approval at the local level and supported by review\nand monitoring at the provincial and State levels.\n\nTo recover the full cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) and a reasonable portion\n53.\nof the investment cost, water tariffs in Henan have been increased substantially since the mid-\n1990s,  particularly  in  water-deficit  areas.  For  example,  in  Sanmenxia  City  within  the  project\narea,  the  tariff  for  industrial  water  increased  from  Y0.35/cubic  meter  (m3)  in  1990  to  Y2.00-\n4.00/m3  in  1997.  During  project  processing,  on  ADB\u2019s  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  were\ndevelopment  of  a  better  balance  between  public  water  supply  and  private  access  to\ngroundwater, introduction of higher tariffs for groundwater extraction, installation of wastewater\ntreatment facilities whenever urban water supplies are increased, and water tariffs to include the\ninvestment  and  operating  costs  for  wastewater  treatment  systems.    As  a  result  of  this  policy\ndialogue, the project water authorities agreed that water tariffs will be set at levels ensuring the\nfull recovery of both capital investment and O&M costs, and a reasonable return on investment.\nIt was also agreed that the Project would provide for investment in water supply systems, water\ntreatment  plants  and  wastewater  treatment,  and  water-saving  irrigation  systems,  in  a  phased\ndevelopment program.\n\n5.\n\nEnterprise Reform\n\n54.\nPromoting enterprise reform is a strategic objective of ADB\u2019s PRC operations. ADB has\nencouraged  company  restructuring  to  introduce  shareholding  with  diversified  ownership.  The\nmain  thrust  of  the  policies  is  to  introduce  a  modern  enterprise  structure,  focus  on  profit\norientation,  and  increase  managerial  autonomy  and  accountability.  In  the  project  area,  this\npolicy  advice  is  directly  related  to  agricultural  enterprises  where  improved  management\ncapabilities,  attention  to  product  quality  and  competitive  pricing,  and  enhanced  marketing\nanalysis are needed.  Experience has shown that private ownership of agricultural enterprises in\nthe PRC has been a significant factor in profitability.  The supply and marketing cooperatives,\nwhich link the State and farmers in over 30,000 cooperatives nationwide, have incurred losses\namounting  to  Y32.2  billion  ($3.88  billion)  since  1992  and  must  be  reformed.  In  January  1999,\nthe  State  Council  announced  that  local  governments  should  sever  their  ties  with  business\noperations. Accordingly, the Project targets four private sector pilot enterprises to demonstrate\nthe future role of corporate production systems with export potential, which can mobilize groups\nof farmers and provide them with technical advice and inputs.\n\n6.\n\nGovernance and Anticorruption\n\n55.\nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders/suppliers/contractors  to  observe\nthe  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB  financed  contracts,\nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions\nadded  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  were  discussed.  The  PRC  Country\nAssistance  Program  includes  assistance  to  the  Government  that  will  improve  governance  and\nprovide  incentives  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  longer  term.  In  1998,  ADB  TA\nrelated  to  the  consulting  industry  and  auditing  addressed  some  of  the  elements  of  ADB\u2019s\nanticorruption  policy.  Under  TA  3138,32  ADB  consultants  are  assisting  the  Government  in\n\n32 TA  3138-PRC:  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Engagement  of  Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f16\n\ndeveloping detailed guidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants, which increase\ntransparency,  take  account  of  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  and  provide  for\nequal  opportunity  competition.  TA  310333  will  strengthen  the  Government's  auditing  system  to\nconform  with  the  requirements  of  the  Audit  Law  and,  as  far  as  practicable,  of  international\nauditing  standards  by  helping  to  (i)  formulate  government  auditing  standards  and  procedures,\nand  (ii)  design  and  implement  an  audit-training  program  to  promote  full  and  consistent\nadherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and  procedures  by  government  auditors.  When\ncompleted, this work should strengthen the Government's ability to detect fraud and corruption.\n\n56.\nThe Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted\nwell-publicized campaigns against official corruption. Under TA 2845,34 assistance was provided\nto  draft  procurement  regulations  and  standard  bidding  documents.  The  six  sets  of  draft\nregulations  and  the  three  sets  of  sample  bidding  documents  produced  under  the  TA  contain\nprovisions  related  to  corrupt  or  fraudulent  practices,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption\npolicy. Under this TA, ADB provided comments on the draft of a national Law on Tendering and\nBidding  of  the  PRC  (adopted  at  the  11th  Session  of  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  Ninth\nNational People's Congress on 30 August 1999, promulgated by Order No. 21 of the President\nof  the  PRC  on  30  August  30  1999)  that  became  effective  as  of  1  January  2000.  The  law\nstipulates  that  tender  and  bidding  activities  will  follow  the  principles  of  openness,  fairness,\nimpartiality, and good faith (Article 5). This law covers key construction projects funded by the\nState  and  all  externally  funded  projects.  Article  6  stipulates  that  \u201cno  organizations  or  persons\nshall,  by  any  means,  limit  or  exclude  legal  persons  or  other  organizations  outside  from  other\nregions  or  systems  from  participating  in  the  bidding  procedure.  No  illegal  interference  in  any\nform  is  permitted  in  the  bidding  process.\u201d  Article  32  specifically  prohibits  bribes  and  collusion,\nwhile Articles 49-64 specify appropriate sanctions for all abuses of the law, including substantial\nfines and criminal prosecution.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nHenan  is  a  relatively  poor  interior  province  (ranking  18th  in  the  PRC),  with  GDP  per\n57.\ncapita of Y4,356 in 1998, compared with the national average of Y6,392.  The rural economy in\nthe  western  part  of  the  province  is  the  most  disadvantaged.    West  Henan  accounts  for  about\none third of the province\u2019s land area and one fifth of its population. The high population density\n(340 persons per square kilometer (km2), hilly to mountainous terrain (79 percent of land area),\nscarce  arable  land  (0.07  ha  per  capita),  climatic  extremes,  lack  of  infrastructure,  and  limited\nwater resources have impeded economic development and kept farmers poor.35\n\n58.\nHigh population density has resulted in intensive cultivation of crops on 40 percent of the\nland area in West Henan, which comprises highly fragile loess soils. The resulting extensive soil\nerosion  causes  downstream  environmental  degradation  and  reduces  land  productivity.  The\nprovince  has  been  attempting  since  the  1980s  to  increase  agricultural  production  and  control\nsoil  erosion,  through  development  of  temperate  fruit,  nut,  and  medicinal  plant  tree  crops.\nLivestock  development  has  been  promoted  in  20  of  the  32  project  area  counties  that  have\n\n                  \n\n33 TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n34 TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on\n\n20 August 1997.\n\n35 These resource constraints have resulted in 12 percent poverty incidence (at $1 per day) exceeding the national\nand  provincial  averages;  12  of  the  32  project  area  counties  are  officially  designated  poverty  counties;  and  42\npercent of the rural poor reside outside the poverty counties.\n\n\f17\n\n200,000 ha of natural pastures. West Henan has emerged as a major supplier of beef, pork, and\nmutton to domestic and export markets. These horticulture and livestock programs have been\nsuccessful in raising farm incomes, a contributing factor in the selection of West Henan as the\nlocation for ADB\u2019s first poverty-related project in agriculture in the PRC.\n\n59.\nThe inability to access medium- and long-term rural credit has limited the ability of poor\nfarmers  to  move  out  of  subsistence  farming  through  investment  in  cash  crop  and  livestock\ndevelopment.  This  problem  has  also  constrained \nthe  development  of  downstream\nagroprocessing  and  marketing  by  agro-industrial  enterprises(cid:190)especially  in \nthe  private\nsector(cid:190)which are needed to create an effective demand for the farmers\u2019 produce, maintain high\nfarm-gate  prices,  and  generate  off-farm  employment  opportunities.  Credit  constraints  and  the\nlack  of  fixed  assets  collateral  hinder  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  effort  to  integrate  agricultural\nproduction  with  agroprocessing  and  marketing.36    Accordingly,  the  Government  offers  poor\nhouseholds  credit  requiring  no  fixed  collateral,  so  that  they  may  establish  a  credit  history  and\ngraduate to commercial credit sources for future expansion of their farm enterprises.  The key\nchallenge  to  the  Project  is  to  demonstrate  that  subsidized  credit  is  not  needed  by  poor\nhouseholds and is not desirable because of the market distortions introduced.\n\n60.\nPoverty is not limited to income considerations alone. A clear correlation between non-\nincome measures and poverty exists in the project area.  Poor families have less arable land,\nconsume more than they earn, have smaller and poorer quality housing, and are more likely to\nbe illiterate.  Accordingly, per capita net income acts as an adequate proxy for other quality-of-\nlife measures in the project area.  Based on non-income indicators of poverty, the project area\nhas lower rates than the province average for (i) under-5 child mortality rate (0.78 percent), (ii)\nunderweight rate of under-4 children (6.9 percent), and (iii) households lacking access to water\n(10.3 percent).  While statistically the project area has reasonable access to primary health care\n(94 percent), in reality, there is no clinic in 8.5 percent of the villages. A socioeconomic profile of\nthe project beneficiaries is given in Appendix 2.\n\n61.\nLack of access to water is the most critical welfare concern in drought-prone regions of\nthe PRC.  While the limited availability of water resources has generally constrained the quality\nof life along the Yellow River basin, Yima and Mianchi counties in the project area suffer from\nparticularly  acute  water  shortages  adversely  affecting  about  290,000  people  in  the  urban  and\nrural  areas,  livestock,  and  small  and  medium-size  industries.  During  the  dry  months,  local\ngovernments need to arrange at high cost emergency water supply in tanker trucks to support\nthe people and livestock in the affected areas. In these dry periods, local residents pay up to 20\ntimes  as  much  for  water  as  the  cost  of  the  piped  supply.  Industries  are  tapping  deep\ngroundwater at an unsustainable rate and shallow wells are drying up.\n\nThe  Project  will  address  the  major  constraints  limiting  poverty  reduction,  quality  of  life,\n62.\nand agricultural development in project area: (i) scarcity and poor quality of agricultural land, (ii)\ninadequate access to credit by poor farmers, and (iii) inadequate rural infrastructure (especially\nwater).  The  Project  will  increase  farm  incomes  of  the  less  advantaged  farmers  through\nproductive  and  environmentally  sound  development  of  sloping  and  degraded  land  for\nhorticulture and livestock at household and enterprise levels, and provide credit for the needed\ninvestments.  The  Project  will  develop  water  supply  systems  to  meet  the  need  for  rural,  urban\nand industrial water in one of the most severely water-scarce areas.\n\n                  \n\n36 During processing, commercial banks indicated that they were not keen to act as a financial intermediary due to the\n\nlack of collateral, market risks, and high transaction costs.\n\n\f18\n\nThe  success  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program  demonstrates  the\n63.\nimportance of carefully targeting assistance to such poor, resource-constrained areas; however,\neven  more  important  is  to  target  poor  households  within  those  areas.  The  horticulture  and\nlivestock components will be targeted toward areas where there poverty incidence is high and\nthe  people  are  disadvantaged  by  resource  constraints.  The  potential  direct  beneficiaries  of\nthese  two  components  are  about  140,000  households.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  specifically\ntarget at least 40 percent of beneficiaries below the international poverty line.\n\n B.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n64.\nThe primary objective is to promote economic growth and increase farm incomes of poor\nfarmers in West Henan. The Project will include (i) environmentally sustainable development of\nsloping  lands  for  horticulture;  (ii)  expansion  of  livestock  production  using  underutilized  natural\npastures  and  crop  residues;  and  (iii)  provision  of  reliable  water  supplies  for  rural,  urban,  and\nindustrial use. The Project will initially cover 22 of 32 counties in West Henan and three other\ndistricts  or  suburban  areas.  Nine  of  the  counties  are  nationally  designated  poverty  counties.\nThe project framework is in Appendix 3. The project components are described below.\n\n1.\n\nHorticulture Development\n\nThe  horticulture  component  will  cover  11,267  ha  in  18  counties  and  involve  about\n65.\n114,000  farm  households.  It  will  support  the  development  and  rehabilitation  of  fruit  tree  crops\nand traditional medicinal plants, and field and greenhouse vegetables. The tree crops on 8,300\nha include apples, Chinese date, kiwi fruit (Chinese gooseberry), gingko, and eucommia.37  Kiwi\nfruit,  gingko  and  eucommia  will  be  planted  from  saplings,  and  apple  and  date  varieties  will  be\ngrafted onto old varieties. Field vegetables will cover 2,800 ha, and 5,000 greenhouses (on 167\nha) will be established.\n\nincluding \n\ntraining  of  extension  workers  and \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  technical  and  financial  support  for  the  development  and\n66.\nmaintenance  of  orchards, \nland\ndevelopment,  procurement  of  farm  inputs,  and  development  of  irrigation  systems  for  some\nselected  crops.  The  topography  of  the  orchards  varies  from  flat  and  gently  undulating  land  to\nsteep hillsides. Areas with less than a 10-degree slope will be planted on the contour and the\nspace in-between the trees will be planted with ground cover crops. Areas with slopes of 10-25\ndegrees  will  be  terraced,  and  full  technical  services  on  proper  terrace  construction,\nmaintenance, and rehabilitation will be provided at each site.38 No area steeper than 25 degrees\nwill be used for agricultural production and no area of protected arable land will be used for tree\ncrops.\n\nfarmers, \n\n                  \n\n37 The bark and leaves of the eucommia tree are used as herbal medicines.\n38 Useful  experience  can  be  drawn  from  Loan  1336-PRC:  Beijing Environment Improvement,  for  $157  million,\napproved on 29 November 1994, which dealt with pollution abatement at drinking water reservoirs and carried out\nthe following activities (i) planting trees and contouring hills in the high-elevation area at the first control belt outside\nthe  Beijing  in  the  Miyun  and  Huairou  Reservoirs;  (ii)  planting  trees  and  constructing  terraces,  check  dams,  and\nponds  at  the  second  control  belt;  and  (iii)  planting  trees,  developing  water  conservation  and  ponds,  constructing\ndams and drainage canals at the third control belt. About 401 km2 of land was rehabilitated, including 4,784 ha of\nterraces, 21,550 ha of conservation forest, and 11,603 ha of economic forest. Three demonstration comprehensive\nwatershed management and development areas, and two mud and rock debris control and forecasting areas have\nbeen established. About 25,141 check dams, 34 km of drainage canals, and 7.1 km of protective dams have been\ncompleted.\n\n\f19\n\nThe  Project  will  support  a  program  for  training  project  participants  at  the  village,\n67.\ntownship,  county,  and  provincial  levels.39  The  training  and  technical  support  program  will  take\non several formats generally based on group formation (such as farmer technical associations,\nwhere they exist) for the specific crop to be grown. In the case of crops that will be processed\n(eucommia, gingko and field vegetables), processing companies will give training and technical\nsupport,  with  support  from  high-level  research  institute  staff  and  extension  technicians.  Key\nfarmers  will  receive  special  and  extended  training,  and  will  transfer  this  knowledge  to  other\nfarmers  in  the  locality.  Training  and  technical  support  will  be  channeled  through  the  line\nagencies  responsible  for  each  crop.  Research  institute  staff  and  extension  technicians  will\nconduct extended and specialized training for selected key farmers and township technicians. At\nleast  one  member  of  all  participant  farmer  households  will  receive  basic  training.  Updated\ntechnical  and  market  information  will  be  available  to  farmers  during  project  implementation,  to\nenable them to make informed choices on crop selection.\n\n2.\n\nLivestock Development\n\nThe  livestock  component  is  designed  following  proven  farm  models,40  which  are\n68.\ntechnically sound and make optimal use of underutilized pastureland and crop residues in the\nproject area. The component will support cattle breeding and raising in about 9,500 households,\nand sheep and goat breeding and raising in about 14,400 households. In addition, the Project is\nexpected to support the establishment of an integrated 600 head purebred piggery, 3,000 head\nfirst-cross  piggery,41  and  2,000  pig-raising  households.42  The  Project  will  provide  technical,\nfinancial, and marketing support to the participating households, including training of extension\nworkers and farmers. In particular, it will provide for (i) farmer training in livestock management,\nincluding straw and forage treatment and grassland utilization; and (ii) a system for monitoring\nthe  component\u2019s  impact  on  pastures  and  grasslands.  Established  enterprises  with  cross\nshareholding will be involved in the breeding piggeries.\n\n3.\n\nWater Supply and Irrigation Scheme\n\n69.\nThis component will mitigate serious water shortages in Yima City and Mianchi County\nthrough the construction of facilities for lifting and conveying 83 million m3 of water per year from\nthe Yellow River for rural and urban household consumption,43 industrial and livestock uses, and\nirrigation. The component involves (i) construction of a pumping station on the right bank of the\nYellow River at Huaiba, near Sanmenxia City, which will draw water into settlement basins; (ii)\nconstruction  of  three  pumping  stations  to  lift  the  water  in  stages,  and  a  12.4  km  long\nconveyance  system;  (iii)  construction  at  Xiduancun  of  a  regulating  reservoir  with  a  capacity  of\n24.6 million m3, behind an earth-filled 45-meter (m)-high dam (with crest length of 642.5 m), to\nstore part of the water released from the conveyance system for use during periods when water\ncannot be supplied directly from the river because of high sediment content; (iv) construction of\nwater treatment plants and expansion of the water reticulation systems in the Yima and Mianchi\nservice  areas;  (v)  development  of  an  irrigation  system  to  serve  1,300  ha  of  orchards;  and  (vi)\n\n                  \n\n39 Separate grant funding is sought to support curriculum development and training, demonstration projects, a pilot\ninformation system, and strengthening of extension and NGOs supporting poverty reduction in the project area.\n\n40 The livestock models are based on the successful experience of the World Bank\u2019s HADP, completed in 1999.\n41  The  purebred  stock  will  be  partly  imported,  whereas  the  first-cross  animals  (three-way  cross  offspring  of  the\n\npurebreds) will be born in the PRC.\n\n42 The Government has also studied the importation of purebred boar semen, but problems of semen preservation\n\nand quarantine restrictions currently render this approach impractical.\n\n43 The  inclusion  of  an  associated  sewage  treatment  system  for  the  urban  areas  will  be  funded  entirely  by  the\n\nGovernment.\n\n\f20\n\nresettlement of 1,603 persons in 367 households. The pumps, most of the conveyance system,\nand the reservoir will be constructed for a capacity of 3 m3/second (s), while sections of tunnels\nwill  be  designed  for  7  m3/s  to  allow  for  future  expansion  of  the  system.  The  component  will\ndirectly  benefit  about  65,000  households  in  Yima,  Mianchi,  and  three  rural  villages;  provide\nirrigation water for 1,300 ha in six villages; and supply water for employment-creating industries.\n\n70.\nThe  Yellow  River  Basin  Commission,  which  regulates  the  extraction  of  water  from  the\nYellow  River,  has  approved  the  diversion  of  water  at  a  maximum  rate  of  7  m3/s.    The  water\nauthority  concerned,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  (which  are\nconsistent  with  ADB  policies),  prepared  a  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP),  and  the  relatively\nsmall-scale  resettlement  of  the  affected  families  (367  households)  has  been  substantially\ncompleted without any significant problems to date. Appendix 2 contains a summary RAP.\n\n C.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n71.\nThe total cost of the Project is $151.3 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange\ncomponent  of  $66.1  million  equivalent  and  a  local  currency  component  of  $85.2  million\nequivalent  (Table  1).  The  cost  estimate  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and\nduties,  front-end  fee,  and  interest  during  construction  (IDC)  on  ADB  and  domestic  loans.\nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The  loan  amount  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the\nProject,  with  the  exception  of  $1.8  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the  sewage  treatment\nplants and minor PMO operating costs that will be entirely funded by the Government. Interest\nwill  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US\ndollar loans. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years,\n0.75 percent progressive commitment charge, and 1.0 percent front-end fee.\n\n\f21\n\nThe  counterpart  local  currency  requirements  will  be  provided  by  the  provincial,\n73.\nmunicipal,  county,  and  township  level  governments  through  annual  budgets,  and  by  project\nenterprises44 and beneficiaries, who will contribute either in cash or in kind. Loan funds repaid\nprior to the ADB maturity date will be revolved by the county finance bureaus into the agriculture\nsector, with a significant portion earmarked for poverty reduction.45 A summary of the financing\nplan is given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n \n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal               Percentage\n\nSource\n\nADB \n\nLocal Sources\n\n  \n\n  \n\nGovernment\nEnterprises\nHouseholds (cash)\nHouseholds (labor)\nLocal Bank\n\n64.3\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n                  Total\n\n66.1\n\n\u2013\n\n85.2\n\n63.5\n7.7\n1.7\n4.5\n7.8\n\n85.2\n\n64.3\n\n87.0\n\n  \n\n65.3\n7.7\n1.7\n4.5\n7.8\n\n151.3\n\n42\n\n58\n\n100\n\n2.\n\nRelending and Onlending\n\n74.\nThe Borrower will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Provincial Finance Bureau\n(PFB), which will onlend to municipal, county, and township finance bureaus at the same rates\nand  terms  as  for  the  ADB  loan.  The  relevant  finance  bureau,  in  turn,  will  be  responsible  for\nchanneling the loan proceeds and counterpart funds to the project implementing agencies (IAs),\nenterprises, and farmers. The Finance Bureaus will also be responsible for recovery of the Loan\nproceeds, foreign exchange risks (with the exception of loans to enterprises), and servicing the\ndebt obligations to the Borrower. The onlending interest rates to the endusers (farmers, farmer\ngroups,  and  enterprises)  would  be  not  less  than  the  rate  charged  by  commercial  banks  for\nsimilar  loans  of  similar  currency  and  terms.  The  repayment  periods  will  be  based  on  the\nprojected cash flow and profitability of each component.\n\n75.\nThe  county  finance  bureaus,  through  their  township  financial  offices,  will  onlend  to\nfarmers or farmer groups selected by the relevant technical agency (assisted by PADO) at an\ninterest rate not lower than the equivalent commercial bank rate (currently about 7.5 percent),\nwith a grace period based on 1 \u2013 2 years after receiving income from the project investment and\na  repayment  period  of  at  least  four  years,  based  on  the  projected  payback  period  of  each\ncomponent.

The  enterprises  will  take  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  repay  the\nloans  in  US  dollar  equivalents.  For  the  water  supply  and  irrigation  enterprises,  the  County\nFinance  Bureau  will  onlend  the  ADB  funds  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  original\nloan, with the enterprises taking the foreign exchange risk.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Implementation and Coordination\n\n77.\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of five years commencing in early 2001\nand  will  be  executed  by  PGH  (Appendix  5).  PGH  has  established  a  Project  Leading  Group\nwhose  members  include  a  vice  governor  as  chairman,  the  director  of  the  Henan  Provincial\nFinance Bureau, the director of the Henan Development Planning Commission, and the heads\nof  the  provincial  line  agencies  concerned  (bureaus  of  agriculture,  forestry,  livestock,  water\nconservancy,  environment,  statistics,  and  PADO).  The  Project  Leading  Group  will  be\nresponsible  for  overseeing  project  implementation,  coordinating  the  various  IAs,  and  resolving\npolicy issues.\n\nPGH  has  established,  under  the  administrative  control  of  PFB,  a  Project  Management\n78.\nOffice (PMO) staffed with trained and qualified technical, financial, and management personnel\nand  headed  by  a  director.  PMO  will  (i)  compile  all  feasibility  studies  pertaining  to  the  project\ncomponents  and  subcomponents;  (ii)  draw  up  annual  work  programs  and  budgets;  (iii)  apply\napproved  selection  criteria47  in  preparing  lists  of  households  and  enterprises  that  may\nparticipate  in  the  horticulture  and  livestock  components;  (iv)  supervise  local  and  international\nprocurement;  (v)  supervise  Project  construction,  inspection,  and  acceptance;  (vi)  monitor  the\nphysical and financial progress of activities; (vii) coordinate and compile progress reporting; and\n(viii)  conduct,  in  coordination  with  the  IAs,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  in\nconjunction  with  the  provincial  PADO.  The  provincial  PMO  will  be  assisted  by  subordinate\nPMOs established in the project municipalities and counties. The provincial PMO will also serve\nas the secretariat for the Project Leading Group.\n\n79.\nUnder PFB guidance, PMO will (i) review the continued financial viability of the activities\nproposed  under  the  Project  and  recommend  appropriate  actions;  (ii)  approve  the  loan\nagreements with participating households and enterprises, ensuring that priority is given to the\npoorer members of the local communities; (iii) review and approve the annual work program and\nbudget;  (iv)  ensure  that  adequate  counterpart  funding  is  provided;  and  (v)  coordinate  loan\nrepayments  by  the  local  governments  and,  if  necessary,  withhold  annual  budgets  from\ndefaulting local governments.\n\n80.\nThe  IAs  for  the  horticulture  and  livestock  components  will  be  county  PMOs  with  the\nsupport  of  the  local  bureaus  of  Agriculture  (BA),  Livestock  (BL)  and  Forestry  (BF).  The  pilot\n\n                  \n\n46 For simplicity, these two aspects may be combined in one contract, to avoid farmer confusion.\n47 Poor  townships  and  villages  will  be  targeted  first,  with  at  least  40  percent  of  poor  households  targeted  as\n\nbeneficiaries.  Details are in Appendix 2.\n\n\f23\n\nenterprises  for  these  components  have  been  preselected  according  to  the  agreed  upon\nselection criteria. Substitution of pilot enterprises during project implementation must have prior\napproval of ADB. The Sanmenxia Huaiba Water Supply Company (SHWSC) established by the\nSanmenxia  Municipal  Government,  Yima  and  Mianchi  Water  Supply  Companies,  and  Mianchi\nIrrigation Company established by the Mianchi Water Conservancy Bureau, will be the IAs for\nthe water supply and irrigation component. A dam safety panel of eminent domestic engineers\nwill be formed to oversee dam construction.  The project organization is shown schematically in\nAppendix 5.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\n81.\nGoods  and  services  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with\nthe ADB Guidelines for Procurement and ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme for procurement.\nEach  supply  contract  for  plant  and  equipment,  vehicles,  and  materials  estimated  to  cost\n$500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each\ncontract estimated to cost $100,000 or more, but less than $500,000, will be awarded through\ninternational shopping. Contracts for less than $100,000 will be by direct purchase (Appendix 6).\nThe civil works contract packages for the water supply and irrigation component will range from\n$0.3 million to $6.0 million. Each contract estimated to cost $2.0 million or more will be awarded\nthrough ICB. Civil works contracts valued at less than $2.0 million will be awarded through local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB), as they are unlikely to be of interest to foreign contractors because\nof the relatively small size of the works, the remote location, and the availability of many capable\nlocal  contractors  with  a  competitive  advantage  to  carry  out  such  labor-intensive  works.  The\nprocedures used for LCB in Henan Province are acceptable to ADB. Some civil works which are\nsimple  and  labor-intensive  and/or  where  there  is  no  possibility  of  competition,  may  be  carried\nout through force account (FA), or through contracts awarded to village teams composed mostly\nof eligible farmer beneficiaries (Community Participation in Procurement), where suitable. Prior\nto loan negotiations, PMO engaged (using counterpart funds) a company acceptable to ADB to\nassist the IAs in international procurement.\n\n3.\n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing\n\nFor timely project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action,48 up\n82.\nto  the  stage  of  signing  contracts.  ADB  also  approved,  in  principle,  retroactive  financing  of  $6\nmillion in aggregate, for the following items of expenditure incurred from the date of completion\nof project appraisal by ADB to the date of effectiveness of the ADB loan (i) land preparation and\nexpansion  of  nurseries  for  the  horticulture  component;    (ii)  training  of  extension  staff  and\npotential farmer beneficiaries; and (iii) preparatory civil works for the water supply and irrigation\ncomponent (Appendix 6). Without retroactive financing, delays in project implementation would\nadversely  affect  project  performance.    For  example,  after  several  years  delay  in  project\nprocessing,  the  Huaiba  Water  Supply  and  Irrigation  scheme  was  forced  to  borrow  short  term\nbridge  financing  to  commence  construction  of  the  pumping  station  on  the  Yellow  River,  when\nimpounded  water  behind  the  Xiaolangdi  dam  threatened  to  inundate  the  pump  offtake  site.\nRetroactive  financing  will  allow  construction  to  continue  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  thus\nobviating  the  extra  costs  in  demobilizing  construction  crews  and  equipment.  The  Government\nhas  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with  the  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing\ndoes not constitute ADB commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or\nthe Project itself.\n\n48 This was reported in the May 2000 issue of  ADB Business Opportunities.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement\n\n83.\nBecause  of  numerous  small  expenditures  and  FA  works  involved  in  implementing  the\nhorticulture and livestock components, PFB will establish an imprest account with a local bank\nacceptable to ADB, and ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will apply in disbursement\nof  the  loan  funds.  The  imprest  account  will  cover  procurement  of  such  items  as  planting\nmaterials,  small  tools,  materials  for  livestock  holding  pens,  and  veterinary  supplies.    The\nExternal  Debt  Management  Division  of  PFB  will  be  authorized  to  have  direct  access  to  the\nimprest  account.  The  accounting  systems  and  procedures  of  PFB  are  satisfactory,  and  their\nfinancial controls and discipline are adequate for the application of the statement of expenditure\nprocedure.\n\n5.\n\nProject Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n84.\nPMO  will  maintain  records  of  all  expenditures  and  prepare  consolidated  project\naccounts.  PFB  will  ensure  that  the  accounts  are  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to\nADB. The audited reports will be submitted to ADB not later than six months after the end of the\nfiscal year. PMO, in coordination with the other IAs, will submit consolidated quarterly progress\nreports to ADB within one month of the close of the quarter. The quarterly reports will include (i)\nphysical  and  financial  accomplishments,  (ii)  problems  encountered  or  anticipated  and  actions\ntaken, and (iii) a work plan for the following quarter. Within six months after project completion,\nPMO  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  summarizing  the  project\nimplementation,  the  attainment  of  objectives  and  targets,  and  a  critical  evaluation  of  the\nimplementation experience.\n\n6.\n\nImplementation Review\n\n85.\nDuring  inception,  further  details  on  the  poverty  targeting  mechanisms  will  be  agreed\nupon  with  the  Government.  ADB  and  PGH  will  jointly  undertake  a  special  poverty  targeting\nmission  after  one  year  of  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is  reaching  poor\nfamilies, and a midterm review of the Project in the third year of implementation. Regular review\nmissions  will  assess  implementation  progress  and  examine  the  appropriateness  of  the  project\ndesign  and  scope,  the  effectiveness  of  poverty  targeting  arrangements,  the  criteria  for  credit\nassistance, and the implementation arrangements. The reviews will recommend any necessary\nmodifications to the design and implementation arrangements to attain the project objectives.\n\n7.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n86.\nPGH  will  establish  a  BME  system  in  PMO  to  monitor  and  assess  project  impact  and\nachievement of the objectives following ADB\u2019s Handbook for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation.\nSample  surveys  using  the  rapid  rural  appraisal  method  and  household  interviews  will  monitor\nfarmer participation in the activities; their access to extension and training services, agricultural\ninputs,  and  other  support  assistance;  and  changes  in  household  incomes  and  off-farm\nemployment. Similar surveys will be carried out to monitor the access of target beneficiaries to\ndependable  water  supplies  for  irrigation  and  for  domestic  and  industrial  consumption,\nconsumers\u2019  ability  to  pay  for  water  supply,  and  the  impact  of  the  water  supply  and  irrigation\ncomponent  on  the  local  economy  in  the  service  area.  Two  such  surveys  will  be  conducted\nduring project implementation: one in the third year, prior to the midterm review, and another in\nthe  fifth  year.  The  provincial  rural  and  urban  survey  teams  attached  to  the  Statistics  Bureau,\nwhich  assisted  during  project  preparation,  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  these  surveys.    The\nsocioeconomic  data  of  the  potential  beneficiaries  collected  during  project  preparation,\n\n\f25\n\nsupplemented  by  PADO\u2019s  database  on  poverty  incidence,  will  serve  as  the  baseline  for  the\nBME.  PADO  will  assist  PMO  in  preparing  the  annual  progress  reports,  by  providing  data  on\npoverty reduction. After completion, PGH will evaluate the Project impact in accordance with a\nschedule and terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n87.\nThe  Provincial  Government  of  Henan  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  this  Project.\nPGH, through its PMO, has been the EA for several World Bank-assisted agricultural, rural, and\nwater resources development projects. The organizational and management structures in those\nprojects are similar to those being proposed under the Project, i.e., a leading group and PMOs\nat the provincial, municipal, and county levels, with technical support and services provided by\nthe  concerned  line  agencies  at  various  levels.  PGH\u2019s  performance  in  these  projects  has  been\ngenerally  satisfactory.  Several  of  the  experienced  PMO  staff  will  be  involved  in  the  proposed\nProject.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\nAn  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n88.\nGuidelines  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study,  and  a  summary  environmental  impact  assessment\n(SEIA)  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  4  November  1998.49  The  main\nenvironmental concerns relate to the likely impact of the regulating reservoir for the water supply\nand irrigation component. Measures to address these concerns were identified and incorporated\nin the project design. Other concerns raised in the SEIA (and a major reason for a Category A\nrating)  related  to  an  agroprocessing  component,  which  was  deleted  in  later  processing  of  the\nProject because of concerns about project quality.\n\n89.\nThe water supply and irrigation component will include the construction of the Xiduancun\nreservoir, which will have a surface area of 182 ha at full supply level. It will inundate land that\nhas  been  heavily  modified  by  long  human  use:  thus,  impacts  on  biological  resources  will  be\nnegligible. Although a survey of the inundation area found no historical relics or cultural artifacts,\nprocedures have been established to halt work and preserve artifacts should they be unearthed\nduring construction. Sloping land along the reservoir periphery will be shaped and revegetated\nto minimize landslips. Based on 17 years data, sedimentation will not substantially reduce the\nvolume of active storage for at least 50 years. Downstream impacts are expected to be largely\nbeneficial  because  the  Project  will  require  the  relocation  of  the  discharge  points  from  coal\nindustries that have heavily polluted the Jianhe stream passing through the reservoir area. The\ncompensation  release  past  the  dam  will  provide  reliable  potable  water  to  downstream\ncommunities. Spoil from excavation for the water conveyance system and the pump station and\nsettling  basins  will  be  deposited  on  land  that  is  not  under  productive  use,  and  will  not  impede\nnatural  drainage  systems.  Spoil  sites  will  be  landscaped  and  revegetated  under  monitoring\nsupervision  by  the  Henan  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (EPB).  Adverse  impacts  on\ngroundwater  levels  will  be  negligible.  The  impact  of  pumping  on  the  Yellow  River  will  be\nnegligible  because  only  1.6-3.8  percent  of  the  average  minimum  flow  will  be  diverted.  The\n\n                  \n\n49 An updated version of the SEIA is available on request.  As no environmentally significant components were added\nto the project design and most of the potentially adverse activities covered by the original EIA have been removed\nduring subsequent processing, the revised SEIA was not required to be recirculated.\n\n\f26\n\nProject will establish within SHWSC an environmental protection unit responsible for monitoring\nenvironmental impacts, and supervised by the Henan EPB.\n\n90.\nThe  Project\u2019s  horticulture  and  livestock  components  are  expected  to  either  have\ncomparatively minor environmental impacts, for which mitigation measures have been included\nin the Project, or actually improve environmental conditions. The horticulture component will be\nundertaken  with  strict  adherence  to  soil  conservation  guidelines.  Slopes  of  cultivated  land  will\nnot exceed 25o, and other soil conservation measures such as erosion interceptors and broad-\nbased  terracing  will  be  employed.  Any  agrochemicals  financed  under  the  Project  will  require\nprior  approval  from  the  Institute  for  the  Control  of  Agrochemicals.  The  level  of  support  for\nlivestock  production  in  each  village  will  be  based  on  an  assessment  of  grazing  land  carrying\ncapacity.  Grassland  management  strategies  such  as  rotational  grazing,  which  is  already\npracticed in the area, and introduction of undersown leguminous fodder plants will be supported.\nIntensive  production  of  breeding  pigs  will  require  careful  attention  to  treatment  of  wastes,  but,\ngenerally, wastes will be fully utilized for biogas generation and heating during winter.\n\n2.\n\nResettlement Action Plan\n\n91.\nThe water supply and irrigation component requires resettlement of approximately 1,603\npersons in 367 households (338 households in the regulating reservoir inundation area and 29\nhouseholds  at  the  pump  site  on  the  Yellow  River).  The  magnitude  of  resettlement  is  minor  by\nPRC  standards.    Households  in  the  inundation  area  will  be  relocated  to  four  sites  around  the\nreservoir and, in most cases, will move less than 1 km from their current dwellings. An updated\nRAP,  prepared  in  1999,  and  consistent  with  ADB  policy,  provides  a  time-bound  agenda  for\nrelocation and adequate compensation.50 The main concerns are a decrease in the average per\ncapita  agricultural  land  from  the  present  2.04  mu  to  1.38  mu  after  relocation,  and  a  possible\nlowering of grain yields on the new land. To avoid a fall in on-farm income, the resettlement plan\nincludes  financial  and  technical  support  for  cultivating  high-value,  irrigated  orchard  and\nvegetable crops on about half of the new agricultural land. Also, the resettled households will be\nexempted  from  agricultural  and  special  product  taxes  for  3-5  years.  There  will  be  preferential\nhiring  of  resettled  adults,  including  females,  in  the  construction  of  the  dam  and  associated\nstructures.  The  living  conditions  of  the  resettled  households  are  expected  to  improve\nimmediately because the housing conditions and amenities such as schools, water supply, and\nelectricity at the resettlement sites are superior to those at the present sites. On-farm incomes\nare  expected  to  reach  or  exceed  current  levels  after  three  years.  Support  will  be  provided  to\nmaintain living standards during this interim period.  For example, resettled households will be\n(i) given preference for off-farm industrial employment in the project area; (ii) given preferential\naccess  to  agricultural  assistance,  the  poverty  aid  fund,  and  social  development  funds;  (iii)\nexempted from various levies and taxes; and (iv) exempted from the mineral resource levy for\nbuilding materials and roof tiles.\n\n92.\nAmong  the  households  to  be  resettled,  29  households  at  the  pump  site  have  already\nbeen relocated, 19 to a site about 500 m from their original dwellings, and 10 to Mianchi, 23 km\naway,  to  join  relatives  living  there.  To  date,  about  125  families,  mainly  from  the  dam\nconstruction  area,  have  been  relocated,  although  some  of  the  public  infrastructure  in  the  new\nvillages  is  still  under  construction.  About  242  families  remain  to  be  resettled,  mainly  from  the\ntailwater  of  the  regulating  reservoir.  A  survey  of  the  resettlement  sites  and  interviews  with\npeople  already  resettled  indicate  that  conditions  at  the  resettlement  sites  are  a  significant\nimprovement over their previous residences. Those interviewed expressed their satisfaction with\n\n50 The RAP was made available to all affected persons and is available for review on request.\n\n                  \n\n\f27\n\narrangements thus far, and indicated that the local resettlement bureau had made regular and\nfrequent visits to monitor conditions in the resettlement areas.  Many of those compensated to\ndate  have  invested  in  construction  equipment  (such  as  trucks),  which  they  anticipate  will  be\nneeded once full-scale construction starts, or pooled their compensation funds to invest in off-\nfarm activities.\n\n3.\n\nPublic Consultation\n\nSince the Project was first proposed for ADB funding in 1993, there has been extensive\n93.\nconsultation with all stakeholders.  During project planning, public meetings, group interviews in\nthe field, questionnaires, key informant interviews, and public display of project documents were\nused  to  solicit  public  input  and  feedback.  Representatives  of  the  National  People\u2019s  Congress\nand  People\u2019s  Consultative  Committee  in  the  municipalities  and  counties  were  interviewed,\nsenior  officials  at  all  levels  of  government  were  consulted,  and  NGOs  (such  as  the  Women\u2019s\nFederation,  Brilliant  Cause,  and  Foundation  for  Poverty  Reduction)  offered  advice  on  how  to\neffectively  tackle  poverty  reduction  in  the  area.    Consultation  will  continue  throughout  project\nimplementation  through  newsletters,  technical  group  formation,  development  of  a  market\ninformation system, and follow-up surveys and progress reports.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nProduction and Markets\n\n94.\nThe horticulture component promotes five fruit and medicinal tree crops, and vegetables,\ncarefully selected after extensive technical and marketing studies. At full production, 5,800 ha of\nfruit  trees  will  produce  about  72,600  t  of  fresh  fruit  per  year  (apples,  kiwi  fruit,  and  Chinese\ndates). Annual medicinal plant production on 2,500 ha will be about 2,640 t (gingko leaves and\nnuts, eucommia leaves and bark), field vegetable production on 2,800 ha will be 176,000 t, and\n5,000  sets  of  greenhouses  will  produce  21,900  t  of  vegetables.  This  component  is  part  of  an\nongoing  development  of  tree  crops  and  vegetables  by  farmers  in  the  project  area,  and  will\naccelerate the rate of planting and reworking trees with improved varieties. Without the Project,\nit is assumed the same areas would be planted over 10 years instead of 4.\n\n95.\nThe  demand  for  fresh  fruit  and  traditional  medicines  in  the  PRC  has  increased  rapidly\nsince 1990. The rising demand has been met by a rapid increase in production. Fruit production\nand vegetable production have increased 4.9 and 3.4 times, respectively, since 1990. There is a\ndanger  of  overproduction  in  some  crops,  and  falling  prices  unless  quality  products  are\nproduced.  Therefore,  the  Project  has  been  cautious  to  promote  only  selected  crops  for  which\nextensive market analysis has been conducted.  Moreover, a flexible strategy will be followed,\nso that farmers can minimize their risk through diversification or choosing activities adapted to\nchanging  market  conditions.  Market  information  and  projections  will  be  provided  to  all  farmers\nthrough the network of PMOs established throughout the project area.\n\n96.\nThe household cattle raising activity will produce 15,580 18-month-old cattle and about\n2,375  aged  cows  per  year  at  full  production.  The  sheep  raising  activity  will  produce  108,000\nsurplus animals per year, with live weight of 5,400 t, and 14,400 aged sheep for slaughter with\nlive weight of 936 t. Raising goats for meat will produce a total of 108,000 surplus animals per\nyear  with  a  total  live  weight  of  6,075  t  and  14,400  aged  goats  with  live  weight  of  720  t.  The\nbreeding  piggeries  will  produce  4,600  purebred  sows,  20,000  crossbred  sows,  25,000  piglets,\n\n\f28\n\n11,200 porkers, and 1,240 culled sows each year. The Project will assist 2,000 households to\npurchase  crossbred  animals  for  raising  porkers.  These  households  will  produce  about  68,000\nanimals  annually.  The  pigs  will  be  sold  in  the  local  markets  for  lean  pork  production.  Total\nannual meat production will be absorbed in the local market, which is expanding rapidly.\n\n97.\nThe water supply component addresses the needs of an area where water is shortage\nand unreliable supply result in the poor quality of rural and urban life and constrain agricultural\nand industrial development. An adequate water supply is necessary to support the growth in the\narea\u2019s population, which is projected to rise from 290,000 in 2000 to 586,000 by 2022. Of this\nnumber,  84,000  will  be  migrant  workers  attracted  by  industrial  development  dependent  on\nprovision of water. Initially 11 percent of the water will be used for rural domestic, irrigation, and\nlivestock  uses,  but  that  will  rise  to  17  percent  in  2022  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  the\nlivestock  population  by  330,000  when  water  constraints  are  removed.  If  water  were  available,\n8,000 ha in the area is potentially suitable for future orchard development. Urban and domestic\nusers initially will consume 13 percent of the supplied water, increasing to 27 percent in 2022 as\nthe  population  increases.  Priority  will  be  given  to  satisfying  all  nonindustrial  water  demands\nbefore  any  industrial  demands  are  met.  On  the  basis  of  existing  industries,  industry  under\ndevelopment, and additional planned industry, industrial demand will exceed water supply by 25\nmillion m\u00b3 in 2022. That excess demand, plus the demand from new industries, will be met by a\nsecond-phase development for which part of the conveyance capacity is provided in the project\ncosts, but no benefits are included in the analysis. The water supplied will be readily marketable\nand will contribute to substantial improvements in the quality of life and economic development.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial and Economic Rates of Return\n\n98.\nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  for\neach  of  the  three  components.  Assumptions  underlying  the  analyses  are  given  in  Appendix  7\nand  the  results  of  the  analysis,  including  sensitivity  tests,  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  The\nProject is financially and economically viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 14\npercent  and  an  EIRR  of  about  17  percent.  The  Project  is  relatively  robust  under  sensitivity\nanalysis, but with some differences among the components.\n\nThe  FIRR  and  EIRR  for  the  horticulture  component  overall  are  16.7  percent  and  18.1\n99.\npercent, respectively. The subcomponent FIRRs range from 14.4 percent for field vegetables to\n20.3 percent for greenhouses (assuming half of the greenhouses are of the simple type and half\nare  the  standard  model).  As  the  component  accelerates  the  assumed  without-Project  pace  of\ndevelopment,  it  is  sensitive  to  delay,  but  not  excessively  so.  One  year\u2019s  delay  in  benefits\nreduces the net present value (NPV) by about 30 percent, lowering the FIRR to 12 percent, but\nstill well above the financial cost of capital (FCOC), which is estimated to be about 8 percent. No\nsubcomponent  is  excessively  sensitive  to  changes  in  investment  or  operating  costs,  but\nChinese dates and field vegetables are sensitive to price variations.\n\n100.\nFor the household livestock activities as a whole, the FIRR is estimated at 18.4 percent\nand  the  EIRR  at  19.9  percent,  with  the  FIRRs  ranging  from  about  17.1  percent  for  cattle\nbreeding to about 21 percent for sheep.\n\n101.\nThe  financial  returns  to  the  proposed  livestock  enterprises  (purebred  piggery  and\ncrossbred  piggery)  are  about  13  percent  for  purebred  pigs  and  22  percent  for  crossbred  pig\nbreeding.  The  corresponding  EIRRs  for  these  activities  are  estimated  at  15  and  25  percent,\nrespectively.  In  aggregate,  the  estimated  base  FIRR  for  the  piggery  enterprise  investments  is\nabout 19 percent. The aggregate base EIRR is estimated at just under 22 percent.\n\n\f29\n\n102.\nThe  rates  of  return  show  some  sensitivity  to  adverse  changes  in  investment  costs  or\ndelays  in  implementation,  but  substantial  sensitivity  to  changes  in  prices  and  operating  costs,\nparticularly among the FIRRs of the individual proposals. Maintaining efficiency in operations is\na primary consideration for success of the investments, but equally important for all enterprises\nis securing high volumes of sales that reward consistently high product quality.\n\n103. Purebred pig breeding, with an FIRR of about 13 percent, should provide a satisfactory\nfinancial  return,  provided  that  consistently  efficient  management  and  quality  control  are\nimplemented.  Its  viability,  however,  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  revenues  and  operating  costs.\nFor example, a decrease in sales revenue by 10 percent reduces the return to about 3 percent.\nPerformance is less sensitive to increases in operating costs (operating costs are estimated at\nabout  78  percent  of  the  total  value  of  sales  at  full  development).  The  returns  to  the\ncrossbreeding  piggery  investment  are  more  robust  than  for  the  purebred  breeding  unit.  A  10\npercent reduction in revenues would reduce the base FIRR to about 15 percent and the EIRR\nwould decline from 25 to about 16 percent.  As there is substantial cross shareholding in both\ncompanies, the overall risk is minimized.\n\n104.\nFor the overall water supply component, the FIRR is estimated at 11.7 percent and the\nEIRR  at  16  percent.  The  overall  figures  include  the  performance  of  the  consolidated  water\nsupply  and  distribution  companies  and  the  performance  of  the  1,300  ha  of  orchards  to  be\ndeveloped  in  Mianchi\u2019s  North  Irrigation  Area.  Separately,  the  FIRRs  for  the  water  companies\nand  irrigated  orchard  development  range  between  8  and  14  percent,  but  cluster  around  12\npercent.  The EIRRs are similarly clustered around 16 percent.  The consolidated EIRR for the\nwater and irrigation companies is estimated at 16 percent while the economic return to irrigated\norchard  development  alone  is  calculated  to  be  about  15  percent.    Individually,  the  EIRR  is\nestimated  at  16  percent  for  Sanmenxia,  about  22  percent  for  the  Mianchi  Water  Distribution\nCompany,  17  percent  for  the  Mianchi  Irrigation  Company,  and  17  percent  for  the  Yima  Water\nDistribution Company.   The component FIRRs are sensitive to changes in operating costs, but\nlocal  authorities  can  and  have  adjusted  water  tariffs  to  compensate  for  anticipated  increased\ncosts.      The  sensitivity  analysis  can  be  misleading,  as  increased  operating  costs  of  the  water\ndistribution companies will trigger an increase in revenues for the bulk water company and, at\nthe same time, prompt a process to adjust water tariffs.\n\n105.  The  base  case  EIRRs  for  the  water  companies  should  be  regarded  as  lower  bounds.\nWithout  the  Project,  the  incremental  supply  of  water  for  the  area  in  the  future  would  be  much\nless  than  with  the  Project,  and  the  cost  of  supply  would  be  much  higher.      Many  urban  users\ncurrently  pay  5-10  times  the  price  of  water  that  has  been  applied  in  the  analysis.  The  true\neconomic return to the component is therefore likely to be much higher than what is presented\nhere.    On  the  basis  of  these  lower  bound  estimates  for  the  economic  value  of  water  supply\nbenefits,  the  overall  economic  return  to  water  supply,  distribution,  and  irrigation  company\ninvestments should remain satisfactory even with a 10 percent decrease in revenues.  Likewise,\na 10 percent increase in operating costs will not have a devastating impact.  Changes in total\ninvestment costs do not strongly affect returns.   These sensitivity results, based on substantial\nunderestimation  of  the  value  of  water,  suggest  that  the  economic  viability  of  the  water  supply\nscheme may be assured.\n\n106.

The  second  phase  water  supply  will\nincrease capacity utilization and the internal rates of return, especially for SHWSC and the Yima\nWater Distribution Company.\n\n 3.\n\nSubsidies, Taxes, and Cost Recovery\n\n108. Subsidies  associated  with  the  Project  consist  of  agricultural  extension  and  training\nservices provided without cost recovery for the horticulture and livestock components. However,\nthe Project will generate additional tax revenues for the Government, including (i) value-added\ntaxes  and  import  duties  on  the  development  costs;  (ii)  sales  taxes  in  the  form  of  agricultural\nproduction  tax,  value-added  tax,  development  tax,  and  education  tax  on  component  sales\nrevenues; and (iii) corporate income tax on all commercial enterprises in each component. The\nwater  supply  and  irrigation  component  will  ensure  cost  recovery  through  approved  tariff\nadjustments, which are based on full cost recovery.  Where possible, project loans to end-users\nwill  be  matched  by  physical  collateral,  detailed  in  legally  binding  contracts,  thus  providing\nincentives for on-time loan repayment.  The total cost of the Project, including subsidies, will be\nrecovered through these taxes, tariffs, and repayment of loans by each component.\n\n\f31\n\n4.\n\nRisks\n\n109.\nThe  project  design  takes  into  account  potential  institutional,  marketing,  and  technical\nrisks. As formulated, the Project is not expected to face any unusual institutional risks. PMO has\nexperience  in  project  implementation  based  on  its  good  performance  in  implementing  the\nrecently  completed  World  Bank-funded  HADP.  The  municipal  and  county  governments  have\nexperience in implementing similar developments, and were integrally involved in project design\nduring  the  preparation  stage.    Counties  with  excessive  debts  or  unsure  about  their  ability  to\nprovide  counterpart  funds  were  permitted  to  withdraw  from  the  Project,  thus  ensuring  strong\ncommitment on the part of local governments.51\n\n110. Each  component  will  produce  a  wide  range  of  products,  primarily  for  the  domestic\nmarket, for which marketing arrangements exist and in which incremental project production will\nbe a relatively small addition to total production in the PRC.  Extensive market assessment has\nbeen undertaken to ensure that the risk of inadequate market demand is minimal.  In addition,\nPGH  will  assess  the  extent  to  which  other  provinces  in  the  PRC  are  undertaking  similar\nproduction  increases  and  make  appropriate  changes  to  areas  planted  and  livestock  numbers,\nduring project implementation.  Farmers will be provided with up-to-date market information to\ninform  their  choice  of  horticulture  or  livestock  options  and  will  be  encouraged  to  diversify\nproduction rather than concentrate all their investments on one activity.\n\n111.\nThe issue of risk has been addressed in each of the horticulture subcomponents so as to\nreduce the risk imposed by reduced market demand due to oversupply and inadequate produce\nquality:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Project will not require farmers to follow precisely the production models of\nthe  selected  tree  crops  outlined  for  the  project  analysis.  Rather  farmers  will  be\nallowed  to  select  diverse  tree  crops  based  on  their  own  informed  assessment,\nplus market information from the Project and other sources.\nAll project farmers will receive training and technical support to ensure a quality\nof produce that can compete successfully in the market.\nApple trees will be grafted with early-maturing varieties that will produce apples\nbefore the market is oversupplied and while prices are still high.\nKiwi  fruit  will  be  produced  in  a  warmer  location  in  which  the  fruit  will  mature\nearlier than those of competitors in neighboring provinces and therefore can be\nsold easily in the Zhengzhou market. Moreover, a controlled atmosphere storage\nchamber for kiwi fruit (3,000 t) is under construction in Zhengzhou.\nGingko  leaf  production  will  be  coordinated  with  the  Lushan  Mingkang  Gingko\nProcessing  Company  that  exports  gingko  extract  throughout  the  PRC  and\noverseas.  The  gingko  production  model  considers  compensatory  production  of\nnuts and leaves.\nOther  products  such  as  Chinese  dates  and  vegetables  are  not  anticipated  to\nmeet marketing difficulties, provided product quality is maintained.\n\nIn  the  livestock  component,  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  recommending  that  pregnant\n112.\nanimals  be  procured  by  the  Project,  to  ensure  quick  returns  to  farmers.    Highly  fecund  and\nproductive  breeds  of  livestock  have  been  selected  to  ensure  that  offspring  will  command  a\nmarket premium.  Pig breeding based on improved imported breeds will substantially increase\n\n51 To date, 3 of the 12 national poverty counties have declined to be involved due to previous foreign assistance, high\n\n                  \n\nlevels of debt, or lack of counterpart funds.\n\n\f32\n\nthe  quality  of  porkers,  with  lean  pigs  increasingly  commanding  a  price  premium  on  both  local\nand export markets.  The risk of animal diseases, and hence loss to farmers, will be minimized\nwith the provision of veterinary services by the pilot enterprise or livestock bureau.  Farmers will\nbe encouraged to diversify livestock production to mitigate the risks of adverse price changes.\nFarmers  can  also  revert  to  locally  available  nonpurchased  feed  if  input  prices  rise,  and  retain\ntheir animals longer to reach desirable sales weights.\n\n113. PMO and the relevant government agencies will need to be sufficiently sensitive to the\ndifficult  task  of  effectively  targeting  poor  households.  Risks  will  be  minimized  by  effective\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements  during  implementation,  especially  by  relatively\nindependent  observers,  such  as  PADO  and  other  poverty-related  agencies,  and  by  continuing\npolicy dialogue between ADB and PGH. Poor households will be permitted to enter the Project\nat a level of debt with which they feel comfortable, and the Project will enable poor households\nthat  repay  loans  on  time  to  take  out  repeat  loans  to  expand  their  production.  All  poor\nhouseholds  will  be  given  time  to  decide  on  whether  to  participate  or  not,  will  be  provided  with\nadequate training and encouraged to join support groups, and will be given the chance to review\nthe  experience  of  other  households  within  the  same  village  or  county.  Poor  farmers  are\nexpected  to  establish  a  satisfactory  credit  history  as  well  as  build  up  collateral  during  the\nProject,  which  will  enable  them  to  access  commercial  rural  credit  for  future  expansion.  Early\nrepayment  of  loans  will  enable  local  governments  to  establish  a  revolving  fund,  part  of  which\nmay be earmarked for additional poverty assistance.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n114. An  estimated  204,900  households  (0.9  million  people)  will  benefit  directly  from  the\nproject interventions: 114,000 households in horticulture, 25,900 in household livestock, and at\nleast  65,000  rural  and  urban  households  through  domestic,  livestock,  and  irrigation  water\nsupply.  In  total,  about  340,000  poor  people  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  Project  and  will\nraise their annual income above the international poverty line.\n\n115. Several  hundred  households  will  benefit  from  the  creation  of  permanent  nonfarm\nemployment opportunities. The intensive piggery breeding units will create 290 jobs with annual\nremuneration  of  Y1.7  million.  Water  supply  will  directly  create  about  500  jobs,  with  annual\nremuneration  of  Y2.94  million,  and  many  nonfarm  jobs  will  be  created  indirectly  through\nindustrial and commercial development dependent on the water supply component.\n\n116. Most employment, and highest returns to labor, will be in the horticulture and household\nlivestock  components.  At  full  development,  the  horticulture  component  will  create  30,070\nperson-years equivalent of annual employment with a total remuneration for labor and net farm\nincome  of  Y271  million,  or  an  average  of  Y36  per  labor-day,52  reflecting  the  moderate  labor\ninput  and  high  returns  from  established  orchards.  The  household  cattle,  goat,  and  sheep\nactivities  will  create  4,150  person-years  of  work  at  a  total  remuneration  of  Y51.4  million,\naveraging Y39 per labor-day. Women will actively participate in the household-based activities,\nespecially those related to horticulture and livestock.\n\n117. At  full  development,  household  incomes  will  increase  significantly.  Before  imputing\nhousehold  labor  costs,  incremental  household  income  in  horticulture53  will  range  from  around\n\n                  \n\n52 The return per labor-day averages Y16 from existing grain production and Y20 from existing apple orchards.\n53 Incremental household incomes are based on average landholdings of 0.3 ha.  Some poor households have even\n\nless land and incremental incomes would be smaller, in proportion to landholding.\n\n\f33\n\nY500 for gingko, Y1,219 for field vegetables, and Y1,340 for Chinese dates, to Y2,100 for apple\ndevelopment,  Y5,370  for  kiwi  fruit,  and  Y7,460  on  average  for  greenhouse  development.  In\nlivestock  activities,  incremental  household  income  will  range  from  Y1,650  for  sheep  and  meat\ngoat  raising,  Y2,330  for  breeding  porkers,  and  to  Y2,420  for  cattle  raising.  The  average\nincremental  household  income  in  horticulture  will  be  about  Y1,631,  an  increase  of  about  36\npercent in the household incomes of 60 percent of the beneficiaries near the poverty line, and\nabout  12  percent  on  average  for  other  participating  households.  The  average  incremental\nhousehold income from livestock is estimated at Y1,983 to give poor households an increase in\nincomes of about 44 percent, and less poor households an increase of about 14 percent.  About\n60  percent  of  the  beneficiary  livestock  households  are  classified  as  absolute  poor.  Before\nimputing household labor costs, total net incremental farm household income attributable to the\nProject is estimated at Y251 million per year: Y200 million from horticulture and Y51 million from\nlivestock.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  the  Provincial  Government  of  Henan  have  given  the  following\n118.\nassurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal\ndocuments.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nWithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  PGH  will  establish  a  suitably  staffed\nBME  unit  within  PMO  and  will  appoint  a  dam  safety  panel  of  eminent  national\nengineers  to  oversee  dam  construction  at  Huaiba.    PMO  will  conduct  routine\nmonitoring  surveys  during  implementation  (including  progress  of  the  RAP),  and\nreport the results of such surveys to ADB in a timely manner.\n\nIn  selecting  farmer  participants,  the  assistance  of  PADO  and  other  poverty\nagencies will be sought to give priority to the absolute and relative poor members\nof  the  local  communities.  For  the  horticulture  development  component,  the\namount of land to be allocated to any household will not exceed 5 mu (0.33 ha)\nfor  any  crop,  PMO  will  issue  guidelines  on  model  contracts,  and  the  land  use\nright contract will include a tenure of up to 50 years for barren upland areas. PGH\nwill  select  at  least  40  percent  of  intended  project  beneficiaries  with  incomes\nbelow Y1,000 per year.\n\nPrior to the construction of the Huaiba pumping station and the Xiduancun dam\nand  reservoir  under  the  water  supply  and  irrigation  component,  the  affected\nfamilies  will  be  resettled  in  other  areas  and  so  compensated  that  they  will  not\nsuffer  a  reduction  in  income,  deterioration  in  their  living  conditions,  or\nunnecessary  social  dislocation. \nrelocated  before  project\neffectiveness  will  be  given  priority,  thus  ensuring  that  they  are  adequately\ncompensated and their livelihood restored, before the remaining households are\nrelocated.    Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance\nwith  the  agreed  upon  RAP.    The  RAP  will  be  publicly  available  for  review,  and\nany concerns or grievances will be adequately addressed.\n\n  Households \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  national,  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments  and \ntheir\ncorporations,  in  aggregate,  will  not  own  more  than  49  percent  of  the  shares  of\nany pilot enterprise to be supported under the Project.\n\n\f34\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe water tariffs under the water supply component will be set at levels adequate\nto recover the full investment and O&M costs and obtain a reasonable return on\ninvestments under the Project by the water utilities companies.\n\nAll  activities  to  be  supported  under  the  Project  will  meet  the  national\nenvironmental  standards  and  EIA  procedures  which  are  based  on  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources\nDevelopment Projects and for Selected Infrastructure Projects  and  no  Category\nA  or  B  subproject  will  be  approved  for  financing  without  a  comprehensive  EIA\nreport reviewed and approved by the Henan EPB.\n\n(vii) \n\nEach industrial unit to be served by the water supply component will be required\nto submit to the IA a certificate from the appropriate environmental authorities of\nthe  Government  stating  that  the  unit  fully  meets  the  national  standards  for\nindustrial emission, wastewater treatment, and solid waste disposal.\n\n(viii)  Tree crop production will not be permitted on protected arable land, as defined by\n\nthe Land Administration Law, or on slopes greater than 25 degrees.\n\n(ix) \n\nPFB  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of  the  subsidiary  loan  to  municipal  and  county\nfinance bureaus at the same rates and terms as the ADB Loan.

All  previous  World    Bank\nlending  to  agriculture  and  rural  development  used  concessional  funds  under  the  International\nDevelopment Association (IDA).\n\n2.\nThe  World  Bank  has  successfully  supported  provincial  multicomponent  area\ndevelopment projects prepared and implemented by the local governments. Eleven World Bank\nprojects covered Henan Province with a total investment of $250.8 million. Four of them focused\non  forestry,  two  on  livestock,  two  on  irrigation,  two  on  seed  commercialization,  and  one  on\nagricultural  development.  The  latter  project  is  the  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project\n(HADP) which, between May 1991 and June 1998, provided $110 million in foreign exchange.\nHADP is very similar to the proposed Project. It covers 20 counties in the northern and eastern\npart of Henan (along the Yellow River). HADP comprised an agroprocessing component for 11\nplants,  horticulture,  livestock  and  some  pig  farms.  After  evaluating  progress,  the  World  Bank\npresented HADP to the other provinces as a model project. In contrast to critical ratings by the\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  of  agroprocessing  projects  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC  (36  percent\nsuccess rate), the agroprocessing component in Henan Province ($38 million investment) was\nfound to be 80 percent successful, although there are ongoing difficulties in relation to operating\nfunds.\n\n3.\nIn Henan, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) completed two fruit processing\nprojects with a total investment of $15.1 million, and the World Food Programme (WFP) funded\na farmland rehabilitation project, with investments of $16.6 million.\n\n4.\nA participatory poverty reduction project in Tongbai County was supported by the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).  The project started in 1997 and covered six townships with\na total investment of Y2.14 million. The project integrated social development, capacity building,\nand  empowerment  of  women,  with  income-generation  activities.  It  used  a  participatory\nmethodology  to  select  and  implement  project  activities,  and  community  development  through\ngroup formation and training was a priority activity.\n\n5.\nBilateral  projects  in  Henan  have  been  relatively  few.  The  Japan  International\nCooperation Agency (JICA) supported a project for the rehabilitation of rice fields ($3 million). A\nfruit  processing  project  in  the  province  was  financed  by  a  Japanese  nongovernment\norganization  (NGO).    Previously,  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  had  a  $7.1  million  duck  raising\nproject in the province.  The Netherlands is currently supporting a dairy cow project.\n\n6.       The Henan Water and Irrigation Project of the German Agency for Technical Cooperation\n(GTZ) was started in early 1998.  The project covers 57 communities of eight townships in four\nof  the  project  counties:  Songxian  and  Yichuan  in  Luoyang  City,  Neixiang  and  Xichuan  in\nNanyang  City.    The  GTZ  project  was  designed  to  improve  the  conditions  of  water  supply  and\nirrigation in the project area.  Total project investment was Y12.46 million, of which Y5.85 million\nwas from GTZ, Y4.52 million from the local counterpart fund, and Y2.09 million was the value of\nlocal labor.  The water supply works were expected to help 7,800 people in the project area to\naccess  safe  drinking  water.    The  water  conservation  component,  including  construction  of\nterraces and dams, and planting of tree crops, will cover 719 ha and 930 households.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nBetween 1987 and 1998, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financed 10 loans (for\n7.\n8 projects) in the agriculture sector in the PRC with a total investment of $779.6 million, and 53\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  amounting  to  $31  million.  This  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  in\nHenan.  In  the  past,  the  Government\u2019s  foremost  concern  in  selecting  projects  for  external\nassistance  was  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  to  repay  the  loan.  In  view  of  this\nconsideration, ADB\u2019s program in agriculture needed to focus on revenue-generating production\nand agroprocessing projects to justify the Government\u2019s use of funds from the ordinary capital\nresources (OCR). As a result, ADB financing for agriculture focused on agricultural production\nand production credit. In the mid-1990s, increased environmental concerns were integrated into\nthe  project  designs.  With  economic  reforms  and  more  emphasis  placed  on  poverty  reduction,\nADB now has new opportunities to diversify its operations in the sector and specifically address\npoverty.\n\nTable A1 provides a summary of foreign assistance projects to the agriculture and rural\n\n8.\ndevelopment sector in the PRC from 1984-1998.\n\nTable A1: Foreign Assistance to Agriculture and Rural Development (1984-1999)\n\nOrigin\n\nLoans\n\nNumber\n\nAsian Development\nBank\nAustralia\nCanada\nEuropean Union\nGermany\nIFAD\nJapan\nNorway\nUnited Kingdom\nWFP\nWorld Bank\n\nTOTAL\n\n10\n\n  2\n  3\n  2\n\n  9\n\n20\n71\n\n117\n\nAmount\n($\u2019 million)\n779.6\n\n12.0\n46.2\n13.7\n\n214.1\n\n302.3\n10,303.0\n\n11,670.9\n\nTechnical Assistance and\nGrants\n\nNumber\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n31.0\n\n53\n\n21\n\n26\n1\n1\n\n82.9\n\n459.3\n9.7\n6.4\n\nNote:  The  sector  comprises  investments  in  agriculture  (including  livestock,  land  improvement/soil  conservation),\n\nagroprocessing industries, and irrigation.\n\n102\n\n589.3\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 2, page 1\n\nPOVERTY AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS ANALYSIS, AND SUMMARY\nRESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nThe  Project  specifically  targets  poverty  intervention  by  addressing  critical  agricultural\nand water supply constraints in a poor inland province.  Because the water supply and irrigation\ncomponent  necessitates  some  resettlement  from  the  pump  site  and  regulating  reservoir,  a\nresettlement action plan was prepared.\n\nB.\n\nSocioeconomic Profile of Potential Beneficiaries\n\n2.\nDemographic  features.  Agricultural  communities  in  West  Henan  constitute  about  83\npercent of the total population, rising to 95 percent in Yichuan and Songxian. Twelve of the 32\ncounties in the project area are nationally designated poverty counties.1 While 98.4 percent of\nthe population is ethnically Han, there are 18 different ethnic minority groups in the project area.\nMost counties have one or more ethnic minorities, on average 12 minority groups each. Almost\n80  percent  of  the  total  minority  population  is  accounted  for  by  the  three  largest  minorities:\nMuslim  Hui,  61  percent  of  all  minorities  and  1  percent  of  total  population,  are  concentrated  in\nZhengping,  Dengfeng,  Yuzhou,  and  Xinmi  counties;  Manchus,  11  percent  of  minorities,  are\nconcentrated  in  Nanzhao  County;  and  Mongols,  7  percent  of  minorities,  are  concentrated  in\nNeixiang  County.  The  average  household  size  is  4.20,  slightly  smaller  than  the  province\naverage  of  4.59.  Average  household  sizes  in  counties  range  from  3.3  in  Luoyang  to  5.0  in\nYichuan.  The average family size in Henan Province is 3.86, suggesting that, on average, most\nfamilies have one additional household occupant (often a grandparent).\n\n3.\nSettlement pattern and production systems. Population density in West Henan is 463\nhouseholds per square kilometer (km\u00b2), or 1,945 people per km\u00b2. Households range from 91 per\nkm\u00b2  in  Songxian  to  1,101  per  km\u00b2  in  Yima.    On  average,  41  percent  of  the  population  live  in\nmountainous areas with over 90 percent in Xichuan, Lushi, Songxian, Nanzhao and Luanchuan.\nMore  than  half  of  the  slopes  in  the  mountainous  areas  are  over  25  degrees  and,  thus,  crop\ncultivation on them is officially prohibited.\n\n4.\nDue  to  the  uneven  distribution  of  good  and  poor  land  under  agricultural  reform,  most\nfarms  comprise  several  plots  of  varying  quality,  resulting  in  diversified  farming  systems  rather\nthan  monoculture.  In  the  project  area,  almost  half  of  the  arable  land  is  wholly  or  partially\nirrigated.\n\n5.\nMany  villages  in  the  hilly  areas  are  difficult  to  access  by  road  and  lack  electricity.  In\naddition, 14.8 percent of the households in the project area lack adequate drinking water.2  The\naverage household size in 332 sample families in the project area was 5.47,3 compared with the\naverage of 4.2 in West Henan.\n\n                                                          \n1 They  are  Yiyuang,  Xin\u2019an,  Ruyang,  Luoning,  Yichuan,  Songxian,  Luanchuan,  Lushan,  Mianchi,  Lushi,  Nanzhao,\n\nand Xichuan.\n\n2  With  the  exception  of  Mengxia,  all  counties  and  27  percent  of  the  townships  (i.e.,  13,484  villages)  in  the  project\narea experience potable water shortages. The situation is most severe in Shanxian (24 percent of households) and\nLuanchuan (14 percent).\n\n3  Minority families are exempted from strict family planning targets.\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nLabor availability and gender issues. The labor force in West Henan is about 8 million\n6.\npeople, or 45.5 percent of the population. Total employment in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) increased by 9.46 percent from 1990 to 1998.  At the same time, employment in Henan\nincreased by 22.4 percent.  Most new employment in Henan over 1990-1998 was absorbed in\nthe rural areas, although not necessarily in agriculture.\n\n7.\nThe ratio of the male-to-female working population is 52:48. On-farm tasks are typically\nundertaken  equally  by  men  and  women  with  few  exceptions,  such  as  men  undertaking  tree\nfelling  and  women  traditionally  raising  pigs.  Survey  data  suggest  that  households  relying\nprimarily  on  their  own  labor  are  income  maximizers,  placing  priority  on  increased  economic\nactivity over increased leisure. This work ethic contributes to effective labor availability.\n\nThere  is  a  slight  male  bias  in  the  total  workforce,  but  the  gender-biased  seasonal\n8.\nmigration  of  male  labor  to  off-farm  activities  results  in  a  developing  female  bias  in  farm  labor.\nWomen  rarely  undertake  off-farm  employment,  using  slack  time  for  cottage  industry  and\nhousehold  tasks,  but  men  increasingly  take  advantage  of  greater  off-farm  employment\nopportunities.  Tree  crops,  requiring  little  labor  input  compared  with  arable  crops  except  in\nharvesting, will increase the amount of slack time for both men and women. The result will be\nincreased  seasonal  migration  of  male  labor  and  increased  farm-based  activities,  such  as\ncottage industry, vegetable growing, and small livestock raising by women.\n\n9.\nCurrent  income  status.  The  latest  detailed  income  survey  of  the  project  area  was\nundertaken in 19954 (Table A2.1).  In 1995, about 36 percent of the horticulture households had\nincomes  in  the  band  immediately  above  the  poverty  threshold,  corresponding  to  the\ninternational poverty standard. In total, almost 70 percent of the target horticulture households\nwere below or only marginally above the international poverty standard.5 Around 61 percent of\ntarget livestock households were below or only marginally above the international poverty line.6\n\nThe  per  capita  net  income  of  rural  dwellers  in  the  PRC  increased  46.8  percent  from\n10.\n1990  to  1998.    The  growth  rates  of  farmers'  income  in  the  project  area  and  Henan  Province\nwere  119  percent  and  72.4  percent,  respectively,  during  the  same  period.    The  disposable\nincome  of  residents  in  urban  areas  in  the  PRC  and  Henan  increased  66.5  percent  and  61.1\npercent,  respectively,  from  1990  to  1998.  Despite  this  growth,  the  majority  of  the  project\nbeneficiaries have annual incomes below the average rural incomes in the PRC and below the\nHenan annual average rural income of Y1,864.7\n\n                                                          \n4 Although there have been changes in project design since 1995, the target group of beneficiaries has remained the\n\nsame.\n\n5  In 1995 prices, the officially determined poverty threshold income for Henan was Y530 per capita (currently Y700).\nIn target groups for horticulture development, 32.7 percent of households had incomes below Y530, including 17\npercent with incomes below Y400 per capita.\n\n6 The  proportion  of  households  below  the  official  poverty  level  in  1995  was  23.1  percent.  About  38  percent  of\n\nlivestock households were in the marginal group above the poverty level.\n\n7 One third of beneficiaries were estimated to be below the official absolute poverty level in Henan Province of Y700\nper annum (compared with 29.9 percent in 1995).  This suggests that the distribution of poverty among potential\nbeneficiaries remains as in the 1995 survey.\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nTable A2.1:\n\nIncome Status of Farmer Households in the Project Area (1995)\n\nItem\n\nHorticulture\n\nLivestock\n\nWater Supply\nand Irrigation\n\n185,222\n775,034\n\n21,000\n89,073\n\n18,645\n51,277\n\nPer Capita Income in 1995 (yuan)\n<400\n    Households\n    Persons\n\nTotal\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n400 \u2013 530\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n531 \u2013 850\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n851 - 1,232\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n1,232 \u2013 1,578\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n> 1,578\n    Households\n    Persons\n\n31,780\n136,804\n\n28,814\n121,660\n\n66,118\n280,065\n\n40,799\n164,576\n\n11,269\n43,421\n\n5,442\n20,428\n\n1,381\n5,383\n\n3,467\n13,874\n\n7,905\n33,301\n\n3,020\n26,261\n\n2,207\n9,261\n\n200\n993\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n210\n840\n\n2,422\n10,210\n\n5,404\n21,580\n\n4,609\n18,647\n\nTotal\n\n218,367\n916,104\n\n33,101\n142,267\n\n32,281\n135,534\n\n74,233\n315,000\n\n49,041\n201,047\n\n18,880\n74,262\n\n11,331\n40,068\n\n11.\nSocial development. Social development has progressed significantly in Henan and the\nPRC after the economic reforms. From 1978 to 1998, life expectancy at birth rose from 68.2 to\n70.8 years in the PRC, and from 68 to 70 years in Henan. The adult illiteracy rate declined from\n22.8 to 15.78 percent in the PRC, and from 21 to 14.44 percent in Henan.\n\nC. \n\nPoverty Focus\n\n12.\nPoverty in the PRC.  The PRC has made significant progress in reducing the incidence\nof  poverty  and  improving  the  living  standards  of  the  majority  of  its  population.  From  1990  to\n1998,  the  input  of  funds  from  the  central  Government  to  poverty  reduction  increased  almost\nthree  times.  Using  international  standards,  currently  about  106  million  people,  or  around  13.5\npercent  of  the  rural  population,  live  in  poverty.8  Only  0.8  percent  of  the  urban  population  live\nbelow  the  poverty  line  of  $1  per  day,  but  consumption  requirements  are  higher  and  a  poverty\nline of at least $2 per day is more relevant.  As a by-product of enterprise and other structural\nreforms,  poverty  is  reappearing  in  urban  centers  and  non-income  poverty  indicators  may  be\nmore important.\n\n                                                          \n8 In this period, the incidence of official absolute poverty declined from 9.4 percent to 4.6 percent in the PRC. Such\nabsolute  poverty  is  concentrated  in  the  remote  and  interior  provinces.  The  latest  official  statistics  suggest  that\ncurrently about 34 million inhabitants live in absolute poverty.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nGovernment policy toward poverty reduction has followed an area-based concept rather\n13.\nthan  beneficiary  targeting.  In  1994,  592  counties  were  identified  as  particularly  poor,  and\nGovernment  investments  were  concentrated  in  these  areas.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  and\nDevelopment Office (PADO) was set up at the national, provincial, and county levels to promote\narea-based  development  in  poverty  counties.  Funds  were  used  according  to  local  plans  for\nlabor-intensive  infrastructure  (particularly  farm-to-market  roads  and  irrigation),  agricultural\ndevelopment,  and  livelihood  and  rural  micro-credit  projects.9    PADOs  at  the  local  levels  are\nresponsible for identifying projects and beneficiaries and maintain a very good recording system\nof poor households.\n\nParticularly  vulnerable  households  such  as  those  of  the  disabled,10  the  elderly,  those\n14.\nwithout shelter, (i.e.,  the five guarantee households) are supported by the Civil Affairs Bureau\n(CAB),  which  undertakes  welfare  work,  distributes  grain  to  households  in  need,  undertakes\nsome livelihood training, and provides disaster relief.\n\n15.\nPoverty incidence in Henan Province. The rate of reduction of rural poverty in Henan\nhas  been  much  higher  than  in  the  PRC  as  a  whole.    Henan  reduced  its  official  rural  poverty\nincidence from 16.5 percent in 1989 to 4.1 percent in 1998.  However, the incidence of absolute\npoverty  in  the  project  area  was  50  percent  higher  than  in  Henan  and  the  PRC  in  1998,\nindicating that the area needs special attention to poverty reduction. Henan has 10 percent of\nthe poor in the PRC, and 10 percent of the rural population.11 Between 12 million and 18 million\npeople  in  Henan  are  seasonal  surplus  laborers,  and  6  million  are  employed  in  industry  and\nservices.\n\nThe provincial government of Henan (PGH) is highly committed to reducing poverty. Of\n16.\nthe  Y18.3  billion  budget  provision  for  poverty  reduction  in  1997  from  the  central  Government,\nHenan received Y1 billion, of which about Y360 million was allocated for the 12 poverty counties\nin the project area. In addition, the province, prefectures, and counties raised Y30 million from\ntheir own revenue to complement the budget in the poverty counties. Thus, each poverty county\nhas a budget of about Y60 million for poverty reduction.\n\n17.\nThe remaining absolute poor and welfare households (about 0.25 million) in West Henan\nare often located in isolated upland regions with few natural resources and lack the human and\nphysical  assets  to  benefit  from  or  make  use  of  economic  growth.  New  approaches  to  poverty\nreduction programs and more sensitive targeting mechanisms may help to bring them into the\neconomic and social mainstream.\n\n18.\nThe  standards  for  defining  poor  townships  and  villages  have  changed  with  time.  The\nstandards were Y1,280 and Y1,000, respectively, in 1998 current prices.  Poor townships and\npoor  villages  in  Henan  were  237  and  2,962,  respectively.  In  1998,  1.52  million  poorest  of  the\npoor rural dwellers lived in neither national nor provincial poor counties, and accounted for 47.6\npercent  of  the  total  poor  rural  population  in  the  province.    The  poor  population  in  nonpoor\ncounties were in 1,540 villages of 53 counties.\n\n                                                          \n9  Although the Government program has achieved remarkable poverty reduction, there are some criticisms about the\nsustainability  of  the  subprojects  and  the  spending  of  funds.  An  evaluation  by  the  former  State  Planning\nCommission showed that out of the Y10 billion special funds for poor counties allocated in 1994, Y2 billion was not\nproperly allocated or was misused\n\n10 Generally, the rural disabled are not included in the statistics of rural poor.\n11 In 1997, about 4 million people in Henan (5 percent of the provincial population) lived below the official provincial\n\nper capita annual poverty threshold of Y700 ($85), down from 13.8 million in 1986.\n\n\f4242\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\nPoverty in the project area. The poor population in Henan is unevenly distributed.  Of\n19.\nthe  17  regions  at  prefecture  level,  5  (Nanyang,  Luoyang,  Zhumadian,  Xingyang,  and\nPingdingshan) are considered particularly poor (Table A2.2). Three of the five regions in which\nthe  poor  population  is  concentrated  are  in  the  project  area.  According  to  the  international\npoverty threshold, about 70 percent of the targeted households for horticulture and 61 percent\nof those for livestock in West Henan are living in relative poverty.\n\n20.\nOf the 22 counties and three other administrative areas or districts currently committed\nto participating in the Project, 9 are officially designated national poverty counties, but poverty is\nspread  throughout  all  the  project  counties,  even  in  the  urban  areas.    About  12  percent  of  the\n12.6  million  population  in  the  project  area  live  below  the  international  poverty  threshold,\ncompared with 9 percent nationwide.\n\nTable A2.2:  Distribution of Rural Poverty in Henan (1998)\n\nRegion\n\nPoor counties\n(%)\n100.0\n26.5\n20.6\n14.7\n11.8\n8.8\n8.8\n5.9\n2.9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nTotal\nXingyanga\nLuoyanga\nZhumadian\nShangqiu\nNanyanga\nPuyang\nSanmenxiaa\nPingdingshana\nZhengzhou\nKaifeng\nXinxiong\nAnyang\nKebi\nJiyuana\nZhoukou\nJiaozhuo\nXuchang\nCounty within the project area.\nSource: Henan Provincial PADO.\n\na\n\nPoor townships\n(%)\n100.0\n25.7\n13.9\n9.7\n1.7\n9.7\n12.2\n2.1\n9.7\n2.1\n7.6\n4.2\n0.4\n0.8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nPoor villages\n(%)\n100.0\n14.4\n11.2\n11.0\n3.3\n10.1\n7.8\n5.2\n9.1\n4.1\n7.4\n5.2\n3.0\n2.5\n2.5\n1.4\n1.2\n0.5\n\n21.\nIn  the  project  area,  41.6  percent  of  the  poor  rural  population  reside  outside  the\ndesignated  poor  counties.  The  proportion  of  the  poor  population  living  in  the  nonpoverty\ncounties has increased with time, mainly due to the effective regional targeting policy for poverty\nreduction.  Since the mid-1980s, poor counties in Henan have received poverty reduction funds\nof  Y5  billion,  while  the  poor  households  in  nonpoor  counties  received  almost  nothing  before\n1998.  Compared  with  poverty  in  the  officially  designated  poor  counties,  the  situation  of  poor\nhouseholds in nonpoor counties is even worse. In 1998, the per capita income and consumption\nexpenditure for the poor in nonpoor counties were 9.1 percent and 8.8 percent lower than those\nfor the poor in the poor counties.\n\n22.\nThere  is  a  clear  correlation  between  non-income  measures  and  poverty  in  the  project\narea  (Table  A2.3).    Poor  families  have  less  arable  land,  consume  more  than  they  earn,  have\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\nsmaller and poorer quality housing, and are more likely to be illiterate.  Accordingly, per capita\nnet income acts as an adequate proxy for other quality-of-life measures in the project area.\n\nTable A2.3:  Income distribution and variation of non-income welfare in project area\n(1998)\n\nItem\n\nAverage\n1,912.7\n\n< Y700\n550.9\n\nPer capita net income\nPer capita arable land (mu)\nPer capita consumption\nexpenditure\nPer capita housing area (m2)\nAdult illiteracy rate (%)\nSource: Henan Provincial Rural Social and Economic Survey Team\n\n1,234.1\n24.3\n4.2\n\n824.7\n18.6\n6.8\n\n799.7\n17.8\n7.0\n\n1.01\n\n1.25\n\n0.98\n\nY700-\nY962\n842.4\n\nY962-\nY1,924\n1,437.0\n1.19\n\n1,039.1\n23.0\n4.3\n\nY1,924-\nY3,140\n\n2,388.9\n1.38\n\n1,422.9\n26.2\n3.9\n\nY3,140-\nY6,280\n4,030.3\n\n1.48\n\n2,141.4\n32.8\n1.4\n\n> Y6,280\n\n8,320.1\n1.23\n\n3,082.3\n36.4\n1.6\n\nD.\n\nPoverty Reduction as a Secondary Project Objective\n\nStrategic  thrust.  Sustainable  poverty  reduction  must  structurally  address \n\n23.\nthe\nsocioeconomic  conditions  that  prevent  poor  people  from  creating  opportunities  for  themselves\nand  allow  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders  to  include  vulnerable  groups  in  the\nsocioeconomic mainstream. Hence, projects with poverty reduction as a strategic development\nobjective need to change the underlying conditions that cause poverty, in addition to including\npoor people as project beneficiaries.\n\nBaseline  socioeconomic  information  and  the  PGH  commitment  to  poverty  reduction\n24.\nhave  been  used  to  determine  the  new  poverty  classification  most  appropriate  to  the  Project.\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) current classification system requires that in a project\nwith  poverty  as  a  secondary  development  objective,  at  least  one  third  of  direct  beneficiaries\nmust  be  poor,  or  one  or  more  of  the  project  components  and  20  percent  or  more  of  the  total\nproject  budget  must  be  designed  specifically  for  the  poor.  This  Project  meets  these\nrequirements and adds a specific poverty targeting and monitoring mechanism.\n\nADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Agreement  with  the  central  Government  will  be  prepared  in\n25.\n2000. PGH indicated its strong support for the Project\u2019s help to the poor and noted that ADB's\nnew strategy is in line with current Government policy calling for sustained efforts to eradicate\nabsolute  poverty.  The  project  area  poverty  agencies  and  the  Rural  and  Urban  Investigation\nTeams of the Statistics Bureau will assist the implementing agencies (IAs) to select at least 40\npercent of the direct rural and urban beneficiary households with an annual per capita income\nlevel  below  $1  and  $2,  respectively.  The  agencies  will  use  the  established  poverty  recording\nsystem to monitor the contribution of the Project to poverty reduction. The agencies will prepare\nan  annual  progress  report  to  be  integrated  in  the  progress  report  of  the  Project  Management\nOffice (PMO), which can be used for further beneficiary targeting and adjustment of the project\ndesign.\n\nGenerating income and employment. Project components are integrated to benefit the\n26.\npoor.  By (i) focusing on labor-intensive production in horticulture and livestock, (ii) assuring a\nfair  mechanism  of  income  distribution  between  pilot  enterprises  and  households,  and  (iii)\naddressing problems in the rural marketing system, the Project will significantly reduce poverty\nand  promote  equitable  growth  on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  Project  will  also  stimulate  rural\neconomic  growth  (primary  objective)  and  will  directly  benefit  about  0.9  million  people  in  West\nHenan.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 7\n\nDuring implementation, project impact data need to be generated: (i) the increase in the\n27.\naverage  per  capita  income  in  West  Henan  during  the  project  period,  (ii)  the  number  of\nhouseholds in the target area lifted out of poverty, and (iii) the Project\u2019s contribution to reduction\nof the incidence of poverty in the province.\n\n28.\nTargeting poor beneficiaries. PADO and other poverty agencies will work together with\nPMO  to  ensure  that  at  least  40  percent  of  the  beneficiary  households  are  currently  poor\naccording to international poverty definitions. However, selection needs to be carefully done so\nas  not  to  threaten  the  economic  viability  of  the  subprojects.  The  selection  process  will  be\ntransparent  and  villagers  will  be  able  to  comment  on  whether  the  process  is  equitable  and\naccurate.\n\nFinancing ongoing poverty reduction. The Project will generate at the county level a\n29.\nsustainable  mechanism  to  finance  poverty  reduction.  By  establishing  a  revolving  fund,  the\nProject will enable the county governments to generate additional income that can be targeted\nfor additional poverty reduction projects in agriculture. Early repayments from onlending to end\nusers will be channeled through the Provincial Finance Bureau (PFB) to supplement the budget\nof  PADO  and/or  the  participating  technical  agencies.  For  example,  the  provincial  poverty\nreduction budget for the 99 Henan counties is currently about Y60 million: Y30 million from the\ncentral  and  Y30  million  from  the  local  governments.  The  Project  could  generate  about  Y40\nmillion per year as additional agricultural funds for 22 counties in West Henan.\n\nE.\n\nSummary of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n\nLand  totaling  2,448  mu  (1  mu  =  0.06  ha)  will  be  acquired  for  the  Project,  and  367\n30.\nhouseholds (1,603 people) will need to be resettled. The RAP formulates measures to alleviate\nadverse  impacts  in  accordance  with  national  and  regional  laws  and  regulations  and  the\nresettlement  policies  of  ADB.  The  objective  is  effective  land  acquisition  and  resettlement\nactivities so that the production and livelihood of the affected population can be restored to the\npre-project level (if not higher).\n\n31.\nThe pump site works affect Xipo village, Chencun Xiang, Mianchi County, and the whole\nvillage  has  to  be  relocated.  Xipo  has  29  households  and  a  population  of  130.  The  average\nfamily size is 4.13 persons, and the average farmland is 1.6 mu per person. It is very difficult to\nget drinking water, and the villagers fetch water 3 km away from the village. Accommodations\nare  poor,  and  most  villagers  live  in  mudbrick  and  wood  houses  and  caves.  In  1996  (before\nrelocation),  the  average  annual  household  income  was  Y5,200:  Y1,800  -  Y3,000  for  4\nhouseholds, Y3,000 - Y6,000 for 19 households, and Y6,000 - Y9,200 for 6 households.\n\nThe Xiduan village regulating reservoir affects Xiduan village of Chidi Xiang, Houhe and\n32.\nChencun  villages  of  Chencun  Xiang.  There  are  338  resettlement  households  (1,473  people).\nThe average farmland is 2.4 mu, and the average family size is 4.01. The average income per\nperson is Y2,295, 19 percent higher than the average for the county(cid:190)Y1,927.\n\n33.\nA  detailed  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  design  was  completed  in  1996  and  a\nResettlement  Management  Office  was  set  up  at  Huaiba  Water  Resources  Bureau.    The  draft\nresettlement plan was reviewed by ADB consultants (and staff) at least three times since 1996\nand  has  been  substantially  improved  by  the  time  of  appraisal.  Two  of  the  five  planned  new\nresettlement  villages  have  already  been  set  up,  and  125  households  (496  people)  have  been\n\n\f45\n\n45\n\nAppendix 2, page 8\n\nresettled. Of the four planned schools, two have been set up and put into operation.  To date,\nan area of about 1,000 mu has been acquired.\n\n34.\n\nThe RAP preparation encompassed the following steps.\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii)\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n(x)\n\n(xi)\n\n(xii)\n(xiii)\n\nSet up resettlement management organization.\nDetermine  the  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  relocation  according  to  the  project\ndesign.\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of Reservoir Inundation Treatment Design\nSpecification  for  Hydropower  Projects  and  the  Physical  Index  Investigation\nGuidelines  for  Reservoir  Inundation  by  Hydropower  Projects  issued  by  the\nMinistry  of  Water  Resources,  investigate  the  physical  conditions  in  the  land\nacquisition area. The social and economic conditions in the affected area of the\nProject are also to be investigated.\nDetermine  the  appropriate  rates  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement.\nVerify the results of physical index investigation and household questionnaires.\nSelect relocation destinations for the people to be resettled.\nFormulate livelihood resettlement plan for new settlers.\nFormulate  production  resettlement  and  income  restoration  plan  for  the  new\nsettlers.\nFormulate a resettlement implementation plan.\nBefore  implementing  the  resettlement  plan,  provide  systematic  training  to  the\nstaff at the resettlement office.\nFormulate  reporting  mechanisms  and  hire  a  monitoring  and  evaluation\norganization.\nPrepare to organize for implementation.\nPublicize the resettlement plan and seek feedback from affected persons.\n\n35.\nThe  county  resettlement  office  formed  a  property  measuring  team  with  the  townships,\nvillages, and production teams concerned, and the properties of the people to be resettled have\nbeen  measured,  calculated,  and  verified  according  to  different  categories.    The  settlers  are\ninvolved  in  the  measuring  process,  the  results  are  publicized  on  the  spot,  and  the  settlers\nconcerned  acknowledge  the  results  by  signing  the  documents.  The  results  are  posted  as\nbulletins,  so  that  the  settlers  can  monitor  the  calculated  property  results  for  the  village.  The\ncompensation  rates  and  the  amount  for  each  household  are  publicized  on  bulletin  boards,  and\nafter  verification  by  the  resettlement  household  concerned,  registration  cards  are  filled  out  for\neach  item  and  each  household.  Then  the  household,  production  team,  village,  township,  and\ncounty sign and stamp the card. One copy is kept in archives, the other copies are kept by the\nresettlement  household  concerned,  the  Relocation  Branch.  and  the  Finance  Branch  of  the\nCounty Resettlement Office, respectively.\n\n36.\nThe  survey  shows  that  367  households  (1,603  people)  must  be  relocated,  and\nproduction  resettlement  carried  out  for  1,551  people.  The  Project  needs  to  acquire  2,448  mu,\nincluding  2,061  mu  farmland,  accounting  for  84  percent  of  the  total  amount  of  land  acquired.\nChannel construction requires the lease of 613 mu.  Houses totaling 48,046 m2 will be relocated,\nincluding  4,476  m2  brick-cement  houses,  20,027  m2  brick-wood  houses,  1,248  m2  brick  caves,\n9,160 m2 earth caves, and 2,703 m2 houses of other types.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 2, page 9\n\nThe land compensation rate for permanently acquired land is determined at six times the\n37.\nunit output, plus a resettlement subsidy at four times, giving a total land compensation rate of ten\ntimes the unit output.  The farmland compensation rate was calculated to be Y2,570 per mu. The\nannual  output  value  of  fruit  orchards  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  produce  and  price,  and  a\nmature  fruit  garden  ready  for  harvest  was  estimated  at  Y15,000  per  mu,  while  an  immature\norchard was Y4,500 per mu. The compensation for land for housing and public work areas is the\nsame as for dry land. In addition, each resettled household receives resettlement subsidies for\nmoving and transportation, material loss, loss of work, and others.\n\n38.\nFive new resettlement villages are planned: Xipo of Huaiba village, Dongling of Duancun\nvillage, West Slope of Duancun village, South Slope of Houhe village and North Slope of Houhe\nvillage.  The  new  villages  have  advantageous  locations  and  flat  surfaces.  Vacant  land\nsurrounding the villages ensures the potential for future development. More important, the new\nvillages  are  within  1  km  of  the  original  villages,  so  that  the  transportation,  power,  and  water\nsupply facilities are easily upgraded.\n\nThe  following  preferential  policies  apply  to  the  resettled  persons:  (i)  projects  related  to\n39.\nindustrial and agricultural production in the project area are given priority, and in the recruitment\nprocess, the workforce of the resettled and the residents of the relocation destinations are given\npriority;  (ii)  agricultural  aid,  poverty-aid  fund,  and  other  social  development  funds  such  as\ntransportation,  post,  education  and  health  services  are  provided  to  support  the  livelihood  and\nproduction  activities  of  the  resettled:  (iii)  housing  construction  for  the  resettled  households  is\nexempt from the farmland utilization levy, land utilization levy, real estate taxes, and other fees;\n(iv)  the  industrial,  agricultural,  and  animal  farming  levies  of  the  townships  are  adjusted\naccording to the impact after relocation; (v) stone, sand, and roof tiles for the construction of the\nsettlers' new houses are exempt from the mineral resource levy; and (vi)  a support fund is set\nup  as  a  poverty-aid  fund  for  the  new  settlers  in  later  stages,  to  ensure  that  they  can  make  a\nliving even in special circumstances. The settlers from the reservoir area also benefit from the\nreservoir  area  maintenance  fund  and  the  reservoir  area  construction  fund.  The  direct\ncompensation for such settlers (land, houses, relocation, and house construction subsidy) totals\nY22.3  million.    Relocation  of  public  facilities  costs  Y4.8  million,  while  other  costs  are  Y1.8\nmillion.    Combined  with  price  and  physical  contingencies,  the  total  resettlement  cost  is  Y27.9\nmillion ($3.4 million), which has been incorporated in the project costs.\n\nF.\n\nSummary\n\nIn  summary,  the  Project  is  expected  to  bring  direct  benefits  to  approximately  205,000\n\n40.\nhouseholds.    The  plan  is  to  have  at  least  40  percent  of  poor  people(cid:190)according  to  the\ninternational  poverty  standard(cid:190)among  the  Project  area  beneficiaries.  About  340,000  people 12\nare expected to increase their per capita income above Y1,000 as a result of the Project.\n\n                                                          \n12 The total number of beneficiaries is derived from the production models.  Counties responded to a questionnaire\nidentifying  the  poor  townships  and  villages  they  would  include  in  the  Project,  and  the  proportion  of  poor  people\nwithin those poor areas identified for each project activity.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nTargets\n\nMeans of Verification\n\nRisks and Assumptions\n\nDesign Summary\n\n1.Project Goal\n\u2022  Promote  economic  growth\nin  poor  and  disadvantaged\nin  Henan\nwestern  areas \nProvince\n\n\u2022  Reduce rural poverty\n\n\u2022  Increased \n\nvalue \nagricultural outputs\n\nof\n\n\u2022  Provincial statistics\n\u2022  Benefit monitoring\n\n\u2022  Decreased  number  of\nhouseholds  living  below\nthe poverty line\n\nand evaluation (BME)\nsystem and project\ncompletion report\n\n2.

A vice governor heads the Leading Group, with directors of the Henan\nDevelopment  Planning  Commission  and  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (PFB)  as  deputies.\nDirectors  of  the  Provincial  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development  Office  (PADO)  and  other\nprovincial \nthe  Statistics  Bureau,\nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and sector bureaus of agriculture (BA), livestock (BL), water\nconservancy, and forestry (BF) are also members of the Leading Group (Figure A5).\n\nrural  and  urban  poverty-related  agencies \n\nincluding \n\nB.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nUnder  PFB,  a  provincial  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  comprising  about  8\nfor  supervision  and  management  of  project\n\n2.\nprofessional  staff  will  be \nimplementation.  The duties of the PMO will include\n\nresponsible \n\n\u2022  providing  primary  contact  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Ministry  of  Finance\n\n(MOF), State Development Planning Commission, and other agencies;\nformulating annual implementation plans and budgets;\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  supervising construction and quality control;\n\u2022  monitoring physical and financial progress, and preparing routine progress reports;\n\u2022  supervising international and domestic procurement;\n\u2022  organizing relevant institutions to monitor and evaluate project benefits;\n\u2022  setting up and managing the special fund for the ADB loan;\n\u2022 \n\u2022  monitoring the impact of the Project on the rural and urban poor; and\n\u2022  coordinating collection and repayment of the loan.\n\nreviewing applications of withdrawal and fund disbursement to implementing agencies (IAs);\n\n3.\nWithin  the  project  area,  most  prefectures/cities  and  counties  involved  have  already\nestablished  their  own  leading  groups  and  PMOs.    The  number  of  professional  and  technical\nstaff involved in the lower level PMOs is estimated to be 5-8 at each office.  The PMOs will be\nassisted by staff of the relevant line agencies.\n\nC.\n\nImplementing Agencies\n\nIt was agreed that a small number of company + household models should be tried, on a\n4.\npilot basis, but most of the IAs will be either a township finance office or a township BA, BF or\nBL,  with  the  choice  determined  by  the  local  government  involved.  These  \u201cultimate\u201d  borrowers\nwould be responsible not only for entering into contracts with farmers, providing technical inputs,\nand arranging marketing of products, but also for repayment of the loan.\n\nTree  crops  component.  For  the  production  of  apples,  kiwi  fruit,  Chinese  dates,  and\n\n5.\nmedicinal plants (eucommia and gingko), the Forestry Bureau will be the IA.\n\n6.\nVegetables component. The agriculture component comprising 2,800 hectares (ha) of\nfield vegetables and 5,000 greenhouses will be implemented by the Agriculture Bureau. Part of\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix  5, page 2\n\nthe  field  vegetable  component  may  be  implemented  with  the  support  of  the  Jiyuan  Vegetable\nSeeds Company Ltd.\n\n7.\nLivestock  component.    County/township  livestock  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for\norganizing implementation of beef, sheep, and goat production. The proposed breeding farm for\npurebred pigs will be implemented by a livestock company at the provincial level in Zhengzhou\n(Henan  Xinda  Livestock  Company  Limited).  The  breeding  farm  for  first-cross  pigs  will  be\nimplemented  by  the  Jiyuan  Dazhong  Livestock  Industry  Company  Limited,  a  limited  liability\ncompany already successfully operating pig and poultry production enterprises.\n\n8.\nWater  supply  and  irrigation  component.  The  Sanmenxia  Huaiba  Water  Supply\nCompany  has  been  set  up  to  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  the  Huaiba  Water  Supply\nScheme.  This commercial enterprise will sell bulk water to (i) Yima and Mianchi Water Supply\nCompanies,  which  will  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  water  supply  networks  and  treatment\nfacilities  in  Yima  City  and  Mianchi  County  at  commercial  tariffs;  and  (ii)  Mianchi  Irrigation\nCompany,  a  commercial  enterprise  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  County  Water  Conservancy\nBureau, which will construct, operate, and maintain the irrigation distribution system and collect\nwater fees from the farmer beneficiaries.\n\nD.\n\nFinancial Management\n\n9.\nMOF will be the principal Borrower. MOF will onlend the funds at the same interest rate\nand  conditions  (about  6.46  percent  interest,  25  years  maturity,  5  years  grace  period,  0.75\npercent  commitment  fee,  and  1.0  percent  front-end  fee)  to  PFB.  PFB  will  open  a  separate\naccount  for  the  Project  through  which  the  funds  for  implementation  will  be  channeled  to  the\nfinance bureaus at the prefecture/city and county levels of the project area. With the exception\nof  onlending  to  the  pilot  enterprises  and  water  supply  and  irrigation  companies,  the\ncounty/municipal finance bureau will take the foreign exchange risk. These bureaus will relend\nthe funds to the farm enterprises and participating households on terms and conditions that will\nvary according to the profitability of the activities and ability to repay the loans, according to draft\nloan agreements (between the finance bureau and ultimate borrower) submitted to ADB.\n\nSubject  to  the  general  principle  that  terms  and  conditions  to  end  users  will  be  no  less\n10.\nthan  commercial  bank  lending,1  the  local  government  level  will  provide  funds  to  end  users  in\nthree  modalities.    First,  to  farmers,  funds  will  be  provided  in  local  currency  through  township\nfinancial offices, at interest rates not lower than commercial bank rates for equivalent loans, with\nat least 4-year maturity and grace period of 1-2 years. Wherever possible, loans will be secured\nby fixed assets collateral under a formal loan agreement. However, it is accepted that poor farm\nhouseholds  have  extremely  limited  fixed  assets  of  any  value,  so  emphasis  will  be  on  careful\nselection  of  participants  and  group  pressure,  where  appropriate.  Second,  to  the  water  supply\nand irrigation companies, funds will be provided at the same terms and conditions as the ADB\nfunds, although these companies will take the foreign exchange risk.  Third, the pilot enterprises\nwill  be  expected  to  take  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  will  receive  funds  from  the  relevant\nfinance  bureaus  at  interest  rates  not  lower  than  commercial  bank  rates  for  equivalent  loans,\nthus reflecting a balance of several factors including longer repayment terms (10-15 years) than\nfarmers, foreign exchange risk, and risk of nonrepayment to PFB.\n\n11.\nAs  the  ADB  loan  will  only  provide  44  percent  of  the  total  project  costs  and  few  of  the\nhorticulture  and  livestock  activities  are  likely  to  be  attractive  to  commercial  banks,  counterpart\n\n                  \n\n1  The  Mission  confirmed  that  the  current  interest  rates  on  commercial  bank  loans  in  domestic  currency  for  5-year\n\nrepayment terms (generally the maximum term available) are about 7.5 percent.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix  5, page 3\n\nlocal  funding  amounting  to  about  $65.3  million  is  needed.    PFB  will  ensure  that  the  relevant\nmunicipality  and/or  county  government  is  prepared  to  commit  the  necessary  amount  of\ncounterpart funding (up to $3 million - $5 million per county), to be released through the normal\nlocal  government  budget  mechanisms.  Counties  that  have  excessive  exposure  to  foreign\ncurrency debt or are not prepared to enter into additional debt will be excluded from the Project.\n\n12.\nPFB  will  establish  a  separate  loan  account  (special  account)  in  a  commercial  bank  for\nthe  ADB  funds.    PFB  will  process  loan  withdrawal  applications,  following  preparation  by  the\nprovincial PMO and certification by the provincial PMO that the relevant works or procurement\nhave  been  carried  out  to  an  acceptable  standard.  PFB  will  authorize  the  release  of  funds  to\nbank branches at municipal/county level, where they can be withdrawn by the enterprise, PMO,\nor farm household (depending on which end user has incurred the authorized expense).  ADB\nfunds advanced to the special account will be reimbursed under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure\nprocedure.\n\nE.\n\nProcurement\n\nGenerally  the  relevant  level  of  the  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  of  goods\n13.\nand  materials,  which  will  then  be  distributed  to  either  groups  of  farmers  or  individual  farm\nhouseholds.  For  items  that  must  be  procured  elsewhere  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\n(PRC) or overseas, the provincial PMO will be responsible for procurement by tender.  For items\nthat  can  be  procured  locally,  the  county  PMOs  will  be  responsible.  The  PMO  will  also  be\nresponsible for procurement of training services, inspection/acceptance surveys, and technical\nadvice  to  farmers. The main exceptions to this arrangement will be procurement for the water\nsupply  and  irrigation  component,  which  will  be  undertaken  by  the  relevant  water  supply\ncompany, and procurement by pilot enterprises.\n\n14.\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement.  ADB\u2019s  domestic  preference  scheme  will  apply  in  procurement.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix  5, page 4\n\nADB  has  approved  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  certain  items  in\nthe horticulture and water supply components, amounting to no more than $6 million.\n\n15.\nPGH  is  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  new  anticorruption  policy  and  indicated  that  severe  penalties\nwould  be  imposed  for  any  proven  case  of  corruption  during  implementation.    PMO  will  make\nappropriate  arrangements  for  independent  inspection  and  auditing  to  ensure  that  the  Project\nhas adequate checks and balances to avoid any possibility of corruption.\n\nF.\n\nGuidelines for Selection of Pilot Enterprises\n\n16.\nIntroduction.    On  a  pilot  basis,  the  Project  will  provide  funds  for  development  of\nselected commercial enterprises connected to household production models. These guidelines\nprovide criteria for selecting enterprises. The guidelines seek: (i) consistency with overall project\nobjectives;  (ii) financial  and  technical  viability  of  the  proposals;  and  (iii) financial,  managerial,\nand technical quality of sponsors.\n\n17.\n\nThe following criteria are to be applied in selecting applicant enterprises:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n (iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nAt  least  20  percent  of  the  enterprise  inputs  or  outputs  must  be  linked  to\nagricultural households of the project area of West Henan, with priority given to\nproposals that utilize the outputs of the Project\u2019s agricultural components.\nPriority  will  be  given  to  proposals  that  benefit  poor  households  and/or  are\neffective in creating off-farm employment in terms of investment cost per new job\nand share of labor in total costs.\nProposals  must  be  environmentally  sound  in  input  production  and  processing,\nincorporating  adequate  treatment  and  disposal  of  all  liquid,  gaseous,  and  solid\nwastes.\nThe maximum loan per enterprise is $4 million.\nMinimum pretax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 15 percent, and posttax\nFIRR is 12 percent after full allowance for all incremental cash flows.\nAt least 30 percent of the new investment, excluding both working capital and the\nvalue  of  any  existing  fixed  assets  to  be  used,  must  be  financed  by  sponsors\u2019\nequity.\n\n18.\nEnterprise  qualifications.  If  the  component  involves  a  new,  separate  enterprise,  then\nthe  following  will  apply  to  that  enterprise  and  its  principal  sponsor,  but  if  it  involves  the\nexpansion of an existing enterprise, the following will apply to the whole enterprise:\n\nBorrowers must be small and medium-size shareholding enterprises with at least\na  controlling  51  percent  of  the  shares  held  by  PRC  entities  that  are  neither\ndirectly nor indirectly State-owned, and in which management is autonomous.\nThe  ratio  of  long-term  debt,  including  overdraft  facilities  and  renewable  short-\nterm loans, to equity should not exceed 70:30 and the liquidity ratio, including the\nportion  of  long-term  loans  due  for  payment  within  one  year,  should  not  be  less\nthan 1.25 in any projected year of the proposed loan period.\nThe  debt/service  ratio  should  also  not  be  less  than  1.25  at  any  time  after  the\nprojected level of full production is achieved.\nSponsors  must  have  a  good  track  record  in  general,  financial,  commercial,\nprocessing and marketing management.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix  5, page 5\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nActivity\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6-25\n\nA.

The  analysis  of  the  horticulture\n1.\ncomponent was based on per hectare crop budgets for grafted apples, gingko, kiwifruit, grafted\nChinese  dates,  field  vegetables,  and  greenhouses.  Where  possible,  the  with-Project  case\nincludes  an  initial  wheat  and  maize  intercrop  until  the  canopy  is  fully  developed.  The  analysis\nalso factored in the impact of periodic crop failures for apple, kiwifruit, and gingko plantings, and\nuses conservative estimates for greenhouse and field vegetable production. To account for the\nfuture impacts of increasing surface water scarcity in the central part of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC), the analysis uses irrigation tariffs that increase faster than domestic inflation. The\nfield  vegetable\nanalysis  assumes \ndevelopment replaces the existing grain production, and accounts for this opportunity cost. As\nfarmers  are  presently  planting  areas  in  tree  crops,  the  analysis  assumes  that  the  Project  will\naccelerate a process that would otherwise occur over a period of 10 years. Table A7.1 gives the\nfull  development  yields  expected  under  the  Project.  Table  A7.2  estimates  the  per  hectare\ninvestment costs and working capital required.\n\nthat  kiwifruit,  gingko,  eucommia,  greenhouse,  and \n\nTable A7.1:  Horticultural Yields with the Project\n\nCrop\n\nProject Yield (t/ha)\n\nArea (ha)\n\nApples\nGingko (fruit)\nKiwifruit\nDates (dry weight)\nEucommia \u2013 ratoon (every three years)\nEucommia \u2013 plantation (annual average)\nSimple Greenhouse\nStandard Greenhouse\nField Vegetables\n\nLeaf: 2.2,  bark: 3, poles: 10\nLeaf: 1.5, bark: 0.25\n\nTable A7.2:  Investment Summary of Horticultural Activities (Y/ha)\n\n12.0\n0.6\n21.4\n3.5\n\n142.5\n142.5\n63.0\n\nOther\nGoods &\nMaterials\n3,750\n2,600\n5,750\n2,450\n3,975\n\n2,575\n\n1,600\n\n1,600\n\n450\n\n3,200\n1,900\n1,400\n1,200\n300\n300\n\n83.5\n83.5\n\n2,800\n\nWorking\nCapital\n2,797\n10,456\n12,797\n2,450\n14,828\n\n885\n\n677\n\nTotal\n19,711\n30,245\n45,476\n14,959\n39,421\n\n10,135\n\n11,267\n\n1,549\n\n26,689\n\n8,856\n\n33,456\n\nPlanting\nMaterial\n11,730\n15,272\n7,728\n8,625\n17,250\n\n3,450\n\nCrop\n\nLabor\n\nCivil Works\n& Equipment\n\nApples\nGingko\nKiwifruit\nDates\nEucommia\nRatoon\nEucommia\nPlantation\nSimple\nGreenhouse\nStandard\nGreenhouse\nField\nVegetables\n\n484\n968\n1,451\n484\n2,419\n\n3,225\n\n840\n\n1,590\n\n1,650\n\n950\n950\n17,750\n950\n950\n\n8,150\n\n20,450\n\n22,500\n\n2.\nSummary of results.  At full development (9-10 years from the start of the Project), the\nproposed  horticultural  plantings  have  the  potential  to  achieve  sooner  than  would  otherwise  be\npossible in the project area an additional annual production of 38,400 tons (t) of early-maturing\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\napples, approximately 1,140 t of ginkgo fruit, 30,000 t of kiwifruit, 4,200 t of Chinese dates, an\naverage 375 t of eucommia bark, 1,125 t of eucommia leaf and 198,400 t of vegetables.\n\n3.\nBased  on  the  following  budgets,  the  posttax  base  financial  internal  rates  of  return\n(FIRRs) to these horticultural investments range from about 14 percent (for field vegetables) to\nabout 17 percent (for apples and dates) to 20 percent (for greenhouses). Estimated benefits per\nhousehold  are  summarized  in  Table  A7.3.  The  sensitivity  of  these  base  results  to  adverse\nchanges in output prices, operating costs, investment costs, and delays in benefits is presented\nin Table A7.4.\n\n4.\nGiven  its  relatively  small  operating  margin,  field  vegetable  production  appears  to  be\nsusceptible to variations in revenues and operating costs. The profitability of Chinese dates is\nless sensitive to such changes.  Apple plantings appear to continue to be profitable in the event\nthat  the  average  farmgate  price  turns  out  10  percent  lower  than  the  output  price  used  in  the\nbudget,  which  is  a  premium  price  for  early-maturing  varieties.  The  results  for  eucommia  are\naverages based on the assumption that half of the cultivation will be through ratooning and half\nthrough  an  alternative  plantation  approach  that  provides  a  higher  concentration  of  the  active\nchemicals  in  the  bark.  Although  the  investment  cost  for  ratooning  eucommia  is  much  higher\nthan  the  plantation  model,  because  of  several  advantages  ratooning  appears  to  be  the  more\nprofitable and financially feasible choice.\n\nIn economic terms, the proposed activities produce satisfactory returns, although these\n5.\nreturns appear to be more sensitive to changes in revenues than to changes in operating costs\n(Table  A7.4).  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  of  apples,  gingko,  kiwifruit,  and\neucommia  are  calculated  to  be  about  14  percent  each.  At  27  percent,  dates  have  a  relatively\nhigh economic return primarily because, in the farm model, production and land taxes represent\na high share of the financial costs of production. Following grafting, the maintenance input and\nlabor costs of a stand are low compared with those for other tree crops. Greenhouse and field\nvegetable production generate economic returns approaching 26 and 22 percent. Farmers can,\nof course, reduce the risks pertaining to revenues derived from horticulture by diversifying their\ntree  crop  holdings.  Households  participating  in  field  vegetable  development  may  also  secure\nseasonal  stability  in  revenues  by  negotiating  purchase  contracts  with  vegetable  processing\nenterprises.\n\nTable A7.3:  Estimated Household Benefits from Horticulture\n\nArea/\nHouse-\nhold\n(ha/hh)\n0.20\n0.07\n0.20\n0.20\n0.20\n0.03\n0.07\n\nHorticulture\nCrop\n\nArea\n(ha)\n3,200\n1,900\n1,400\n600\n1,200\n167\n2,800\n\nTotal\nhh\n(\u2018000)\n16.0\n28.5\n7.0\n3.0\n6.0\n5.0\n42.0\n\nNet\nIncome\n(Y/ha)a\n7,793\n11,174\n23,392\n10,807\n2,384\n102,209\n3,977\n\n1,300\n\nApples\nGingko\nKiwifruit\nEucommia\nChinese date\nGreenhouses\nField\nVegetables\nHuaiba\nOrchard\nTOTAL\nWeighted Av.\nHorticulture\nWeighted Av.\nTree Crops\nWeighted Av.\nVegetables\nhh = households.\na Full development incremental gross margin after imputing labor costs.\n b Incremental gross margin after taxes and before imputing labor costs.\n\n10,241\n\n10,071\n\n12,567\n\n9,496\n\n7,793\n\n0.20\n\n114\n\n6.5\n\nAverage\nNet\nIncome\n(Y/hh)\n\n1,559\n745\n4,678\n2,161\n477\n3,407\n265\n\n1,110\n\n1,469\n\n599\n\nTotal\nNet\nIncome\n(Y\u2019000)\n24,936\n21,231\n32,748\n6,484\n2,861\n17,035\n11,136\n\nGross\nIncome\n(Y/ha)b\n10,485\n7,694\n26,842\n7,926\n6,678\n223,709\n18,227\n\nAverage\nGross\nIncome\n(Y/hh)\n\n2,097\n513\n5,368\n1,585\n1,336\n7,457\n1,215\n\nTotal\nGross\nIncome\n(Y\u2019000)\n33,553\n14,619\n37,578\n4,755\n8,014\n37,285\n51,036\n\n1,559\n\n10,130\n\n10,485\n\n2,097\n\n13,631\n\n126,562\n\n200,472\n\n15,953\n\n1,759\n\n11,682\n\n1,674\n\n29,771\n\n1,879\n\n\fAppendix 7, page 3\n\nTable A7.4: Sensitivity of Returns to Horticulturea\n\nApple\n\nGingko\n\nKiwi-\nfruit\n\nChinese\nDate\n\nEucommia\n\nGreen-\nhouses\n\nField\nVeg.\n\nWhole\nComponent\n\n69\n\n17.2%\n3,143\n6.4%\n-430\n-8.8%\n9.6%\n462\n11.7%\n15.7%\n2,858\n110.4%\n4.6%\n-2,004\n\n27.1%\n3,938\n16.3%\n1,056\n-13.7%\n18.9%\n1,751\n19.1%\n24.8%\n3,637\n130.1%\n13.8%\n850\n\nFinancial\nAnalysis\n1.

The  budgets  for  livestock  activities  have\nincorporated the costs of annual animal mortality (and replacement outside normal culling) that\nshould  be  expected  for  households  that  are  new  to  the  activities  (or  new  to  the  demands  of\nmeeting certain levels of product quality), and that should be expected even in the presence of\nexcellent veterinary care. Table A7.5 summarizes the estimated investment cost per household\nfor each activity.\n\nTable A7.5:   Investment Summary of Livestock Activities (Y/farm)\n\nLivestock\nMeat Goats\nSheep\nCattle\nPigs\n\nLabor\n150\n150\n225\n150\n\nCivil Works\n& Equipment\n\n800\n800\n2,206\n5,621\n\nBreeding\nAnimals\n3,000\n3,000\n4,000\n2,800\n\nOther Goods\n& Materials\n\n60\n60\n380\n60\n\nWorking\nCapital\n1,025\n1,116\n3,018\n10,474\n\nTotal\n\n5,035\n5,126\n9,829\n19,105\n\n7.\nAt full development, household cattle raising will produce 15,580 18-month-old cattle and\nabout 2,375 aged cows per year. Sheep raising will produce 108,000 surplus animals per year,\nwith live weight of 5,400 t, and 14,400 aged sheep for slaughter at 936 t live weight. Meat goat\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\nraising activity will produce  108,000 surplus animals per year having a total weight of 6,075 t,\nand  14,400  aged  goats  at  720  t  live  weight.  The  Project  will  also  assist  2,000  households  to\npurchase  crossbred  pigs  for  raising  porkers.  These  households  will  produce  about  68,000\nanimals annually. The local markets will absorb all annual meat production. Table A7.6 shows\nestimated benefits per household, by activity.\n\n8.\nThe base FIRRs for meat goats, sheep, cattle, and pig raising investments are estimated\nto be about 18, 21, 17, and 20 percent, respectively. Together, these activities generate a return\nof  about  18  percent  (Table  A7.7).  The  meat  goats,  sheep,  and  cattle  raising  investments\nindicate  relatively  moderate  risk.  The  porker  production  entails  greater  risk,  which  is  mitigated\nby  the  company  +  household  model,  where  the  enterprise  guarantees  minimum  protection\nprices.  Household  porker  production  also  operates  on  a  rather  narrow  margin.  At  full\ndevelopment, operating costs represent approximately 93 percent of the value of sales, chiefly\ndue to the feed requirements, as these households act as contract out-growers.\n\n9.\n The base return to the cattle component appears satisfactory although, in general, beef\nproduction  by  households  in  the  PRC  may  be  marginally  profitable  in  areas  with  inadequate\nfeed  supply.    For  the  selected  communities  in  Henan,  with  access  to  productive  grassland,\nraising cattle should provide adequate financial returns. Households can also manage risks by\nraising different types of livestock.\n\nThe base EIRRs for the household livestock production are estimated at 21, 23, 19, and\n10.\nabout  16  percent  for  the  goats,  sheep,  cattle,  and  pig  investments.  The  economic  return  to\nhousehold livestock production as a whole is almost 20 percent. Pig raising remains sensitive to\nvariations  in  revenues  and  costs.  The  EIRRs  of  other  livestock  activities  display  moderate\nsensitivity comparable with the results of the financial sensitivity analysis (Table A7.7).\n\nTable A7.6:   Number of Beneficiaries and Benefits per Household\nfrom Livestock Production\n\nLivestock\n\nNet\nIncome\n(Y/hh)a\n1,522\nCattle\n926\nSheep/Goats\n1,818\nPigs\nTOTAL\n1,213\na Full development incremental gross margin after imputing labor costs.\nb Incremental gross margin after taxes and before imputing labor costs.\n\nTotal\nHouseholds\n9,500\n14,400\n2,000\n25,900\n\nAnimals/\nhousehold\n  2\n10\n  2\n\nHead\n19,000\n144,000\n4,000\n167,000\n\nC.\n\nImplications of Debt Financing of Household Activities\n\nTotal Net\nIncome\n(Y\u2019000)\n14,457\n13,330\n3,636\n31,423\n\nGross\nIncome\n(Y/hh)b\n2,422\n1,646\n2,328\n1,983\n\nTotal\nGross\nIncome\n(Y\u2019000)\n23,007\n23,698\n4,656\n51,361\n\nPossible loan conditions have been calculated for the debt financing of each household\n11.\nactivity.

Where investments in tree crops are replacing the existing cultivation of grain(cid:190)as is the\ncase for gingko, kiwifruit and eucommia(cid:190)and there is loss of income in the period prior to the\nmaturity of a tree crop, the calculations for total household debt financing and cash flows have\nconsidered  amounts  of  credit  for  financing  operating  expenses  that  would  keep  the  welfare  of\nhouseholds  about  the  same  as  without  the  Project.  The  scheduling  of  repayments  for  these\ninvestment loans are worked out with the assumption that household borrowings for operating\nexpenses in the period prior to a sufficient tree crop harvest are such as to allow households, in\nthe  absence  of  adequate  savings,  to  avoid  becoming  temporarily  poorer  while  participating  in\nthe Project.\n\n13.\nOf the horticultural activities, apples, Chinese dates, ratooned eucommia, greenhouses\nand field vegetables appear to be best able to accommodate repayment of credits within seven\nyears,  or  less,  including  two  to  three  years  grace.  Apple  financing  appears  feasible  with  three\nyears grace and a repayment period of four years. Eucommia development with ratooning could\nsustain repayment within four years following three years\u2019 grace. The grafting of Chinese dates\ncould  be  financed  with  repayments  over  three  years  following  two  years\u2019  grace.  The\ngreenhouses and field vegetables should repay credits within three to four years, including two\nyears  grace.  Kiwifruit  and  gingko  development,  however,  appear  difficult  to  finance  within\ncomparable  periods  of  time  due  to  the  relatively  long  periods  before  maturity.  One  way  to\nimprove the situation is to have households contribute more cash for the investments, but this\ncould  conflict  with  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  objectives.  The  preferred  response  is  to\naccord  considerable  flexibility  in  the  amount  and  scheduling  of  credit  repayments  for  these\ninvestments,  as  provided  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  some  grant  financing  from  local\nsources might be available.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 7, page 6\n\n14. While  the  investment  costs  for  the  two-sow  model  are  high  compared  with  those  for\nother  livestock  activities,  the  operating  costs  are  also  high,  primarily  because  of  the  feed\nrequired. It is likely that these households will require five years to repay the credit following two\nyears\u2019  grace.  Also,  given  the  margin  on  porker  production,  it  would  be  some  time  until\nhouseholds are able to fully self-finance operating expenses. This is in contrast to the apparent\nability of households taking credits for cattle to repay their debts within five years, including two\nyears\u2019 grace. These households should then be able to finance their operating expenses within\ntwo  years  thereafter.  Households  borrowing  for  goats  or  sheep  should  be  able  to  repay  their\ndebts within four years, including two years\u2019 grace.\n\nD.\n\nReview of Enterprises\n\n15.\nApart  from  the  Huaiba  water  supply  companies  (see  next  section),  the  Project  would\npartially  finance  the  investments  of  two  livestock  enterprises:  a  crossbred  piggery  and  a\npurebred  piggery.  One  piggery,  located  at  Jiyuan,  would  produce  crossbred  pigs  for  breeding\nporkers. The other, the Xinda company located near Zhengzhou, would produce purebred pigs,\nsome of which would be supplied to the piggery in Jiyuan.\n\n16.\nThe  breeding  piggeries  will  produce  4,600  purebred  sows,  20,000  crossbred  sows,\n25,000 piglets, 11,200 porkers, and 1,240 culled sows each year. The FIRRs to the crossbred\npiggery  and  purebred  piggery  investments  are  estimated  at  22  and  13  percent.  The\ncorresponding EIRRs for these activities are estimated at 25 and 15 percent. In aggregate, the\nestimated  base  FIRR  for  the  three  livestock  enterprise  investments  is  about  19  percent.  Their\naggregate base EIRR is estimated at about 22 percent.\n\nPurebred  pig  breeding,  with  an  FIRR  of  about  13  percent,  can  provide  a  satisfactory\n17.\nfinancial  return  \u2013  provided  that  consistently  efficient  management  and  quality  control  can  be\nimplemented.  The  returns  to  the  crossbreeding  piggery  investment  can  be  more  easily\naccommodated than those for the purebred breeding unit. A reduction in revenues of 10 percent\ndrops the base FIRR to about 11 percent, while the EIRR  would decline from 25 to about 16\npercent. In contrast to the purebred piggery these returns hold up well under other combinations\nof varied costs and income. As there is substantial cross shareholding in these enterprises, the\noverall  result  for  the  whole  component  is  more  significant  and  shows  a  robust  result  (Table\nA7.8).\n\nTable A7.8:   Sensitivity of Returns to Livestock Enterprisesa\n\nItem\n\nCrossbred\nPiggery\n\nFinancial Analysis\nPurebred\nPiggery\n\nWhole\nComponent\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nCrossbred\nPiggery\n\nPurebred\nPiggery\n\nWhole\nComponent\n\n1.

The base case evaluation reviewed here does not incorporate any benefits\nof  this  second  phase  of  construction.  The  evaluation  reflects  estimated  losses  of  5  percent  in\nthe  conveyance  system  and  8  percent  in  the  distribution  network.  At  full  capacity  utilization,\nelectricity costs for pumping will approach 90 percent of the operating costs.\n\nDemand  projections  for  nonindustrial  uses  are  based  on  projections  by  municipal  and\n19.\nprovincial authorities. The rates of water consumption are assumed to be as follows: 100 liters\n(l)/person/day  for  urban  domestic  users,  70  l/person/day  for  urban  migrant  workers,  30\nl/person/day  for  general  urban  public  use,  75  l/person/day  for  rural  domestic  users,  and  50\nl/animal/day for rural livestock. Consumption levels are expected to reach these averages within\nfive  years  after  water  supplies  are  made  available.  Industrial  demand  in  2001  is  based  on\nexisting enterprises plus identified industries either planned or now under construction. The total\nannual  demand  is  expected  to  exceed  supply  by  10  percent  in  2001.  As  there  will  be  excess\ndemand,  the  evaluation  assumes  that  all  nonindustrial  water  demands  will  be  met  before  any\nindustrial demands: i.e., all of the excess demand will be industrial.\n\n20.\nThe analysis calculates a return to irrigation development based on the establishment of\n1,300 ha of orchards following the expansion of water supplies. To approximate the net benefits\nof  horticultural  development  of  this  area,  the  analysis  assumes  plantings  of  kiwifruit  as  a\nrepresentative crop.\n\nThe financial analysis uses revised investment costs and cost estimates for resettlement\n21.\nworks.  Using  tariff  information  provided  by  the  Sanmenxia  authorities,  the  FIRR  for  the\nproposed investment in the Sanmenxia Water Supply Company is about 11 percent. The FIRRs\nfor investments in the Mianchi and Yima Water Distribution Companies are estimated at 12 and\n8  percent,  respectively.  The  overall  FIRR  for  the  development  of  water  supplies  is  about  11\npercent. At approximately 14 percent, the returns to orchard development are comparable with\nthose  to  the  horticulture  component.  The  overall  FIRR  for  the  water  supply  component  is\nestimated at just under 12 percent.\n\n22.\nTable A7.9 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis for this component. The Yima\nWater  Distribution  Company  has  lower  returns  and  greater  sensitivity  than  the  Mianchi  Water\nDistribution  Company  due  to  the  priority  given  to  nonindustrial  uses  and  Mianchi\u2019s  faster\npopulation  growth.  The  second  phase  development,  however,  should  improve  Yima\u2019s\nperformance.\n\n\fTableA7.9:  Sensitivity of Returns to Development of Water Supplies in Sanmenxia Countya\n\n74\n\nAppendix 7, page 8\n\nSan-\nmenxia\nWater\n\nMianchi\nWater\nSupply\n\nYima\nWater\nSupply\n\nTotal\nWater\nSupply\n\nMianchi\nIrrigation\nCompany\n\nTotal\nWater &\nIrrigation\n\nIrrigated\nOrchard\n\nWhole\nComp-\nonent\n\nIRR\nNPV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\n\n10.6%\n75,177\n8.4%\n10,791\n-11.7%\n8.5%\n13,541\n12.2%\n9.5%\n45,318\n25.0%\n9.3%\n38,427\n\n11.9%\n2,417\n8.0%\n-16\n-9.9%\nN/A\n-31,008\n1.0%\n10.5%\n1,667\n31.7%\n9.2%\n833\n\n8.0%\n-17\n1.9%\n-3,161\n0.0%\nN/A\n-56,223\n0.0%\n6.5%\n-1,018\n0.0%\n5.2%\n-1,992\n\n10.6%\n77,577\n8.3%\n7,614\n-11.0%\n5.1%\n-73,690\n5.3%\n9.4%\n45,968\n24.4%\n9.2%\n37,268\n\n9.4%\n508\n7.6%\n-156\n-7.8%\nN/A\n-6,346\n0.7%\n8.2%\n75\n10.8%\n7.8%\n-100\n\n10.6%\n78,085\n8.3%\n7,458\n-11.0%\n4.9%\n-80,035\n5.1%\n9.4%\n46,042\n24.2%\n9.2%\n37,168\n\n14.5%\n80,813\n13.5%\n63,752\n-44.3%\n13.7%\n70,344\n77.4%\n13.9%\n76,149\n173.0%\n14.5%\n80,813\n\n11.7%\n158,898\n9.7%\n71,210\n-18.0%\n7.8%\n-9,692\n9.3%\n10.7%\n122,192\n43.2%\n10.6%\n117,981\n\nFinancial\nAnalysis\nBase case\n(Y\u2019000)\nOutput\nprices \u2013 10\npercent\nOperating\ncosts + 10\npercent\nInvestment\nCosts + 10\npercent\nDelay of 1\nYear\nEconomic\nAnalysis\nBase Case\n\nY \u2018000\n\nIRR\nNPV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\nSV\nIRR\nNPV\n\nOutput\nPrices \u2013 10\npercent\nOperating\nCosts + 10\npercent\nInvestment\nCosts + 10\npercent\nDelay of 1\nYear\n\n16.0%\n105,938\n12.2%\n5,716\n-10.5%\n11.0%\n-25,452\n8.0%\n14.8%\n79,133\n38.3%\n14.3%\n64,690\na  NPVs,  expressed  in  Yuan  \u2018000,  are  calculated  using  the  FCOC  or  OCC  as  appropriate.

The total return to water supply (the water supply and distribution\ncompanies  considered  as  a  consolidated  unit)  is  estimated  at  16  percent.  The  EIRR  of  the\nirrigation company is calculated to be about 17 percent while the return to the development of\nthe  North  Irrigation  Area  is  estimated  to  be  near  15  percent.  The  overall  EIRR  for  the\ncomponent is estimated at 16 percent. The sensitivity of these base economic results more or\nless mirrors the pattern of their financial counterparts.\n\n24.\nThe  estimated  base  EIRRs  for  the  water  companies  should  be  regarded  as  lower\nbounds as the economic value of the water supplied in the analysis was assumed to be no less\nthan its total financial value, which is related to the cost of its supply. In the future without the\nProject, the incremental supply of water for the area would be much less than with the Project,\nand  the  cost  of  supply  would  be  much  greater.  The  true  economic  return  to  the  component  is\ntherefore  likely  to  be  much  higher  than  presented  here.  Sensitivity  results,  based  on  a\nconservative  economic  value  of  water,  suggest  that  the  economic  viability  of  the  water  supply\nscheme is assured.\n\nF.\n\nOverall Project Performance\n\nThe  base  FIRR  for  the  entire  Project  is  estimated  at  about  14  percent.

The  corresponding  EIRR  for  the  Project  is\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 7, page 9\n\nestimated  at  about  17  percent,  with  a  range  in  returns  to  subcomponents  similar  to  those\ncalculated for the financial analysis.
