Fruits, medicinal plants,\nand vegetables with high commercial value and ready markets will\nbe grown. Breeding, raising, and fattening cattle, goats, pigs, and\nsheep will be assisted.  These activities will increase household\nincomes and reduce poverty in the poorest region of the province.\nTechnical advice and training will improve the quality of produce.\nEnvironmentally sound agronomic practices and land development\ntechniques will be introduced to prevent soil erosion and pollution.\nClassification Primary objective - economic growth\nSecondary objective \u2013 poverty reduction\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category A\nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken, and\nthe summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 4 November 1998.\nRationale The economic development of West Henan is severely constrained\nby its high population density, hilly to mountainous terrain, scarce\narable land, harsh climatic conditions, and limited water resources.\nAverage per capita annual income is Y1,864 ($225).  The incidence\nof poverty (at $1 per day) in this region is high(cid:190) 12 percent as\nagainst less than 10 percent for the PRC. Of the 32 counties in West\nHenan, 12 are nationally designated absolute poverty counties. The\nregion is suitable for the cultivation of a number of temperate fruits\nand nuts and a variety of medicinal plants.  The region is also\nbecoming a major supplier of beef, mutton, and pork because of the\navailability of underutilized pastures and cattle and small livestock\nwell adapted to local conditions. The shortage of medium- and long-\nterm rural credit and inadequate potable and irrigation water supply\nhave  constrained  horticultural  and  livestock  development.    The\nProject is designed to help remove these constraints.\nObjective\nand Scope The Project\u2019s primary objective is to promote pro-poor economic\ngrowth by increasing the incomes of predominantly poor farmers in\nWest Henan. The Project consists of three components:\n(i)  horticulture  development,  which  supports  the  rehabilitation,\ndevelopment, and improvement of fruit tree crops (apples, Chinese\ndates, kiwi fruit), medicinal plants (gingko and eucommia), and field", "iv\nand greenhouse vegetables;\n(ii) livestock development, which supports household cattle and pig\nbreeding  and  raising,  purebred  piggeries,  and  sheep  and  goat\nbreeding  and  raising,  using  crop  residues  and  underutilized\ngrasslands; and\n(iii) water supply and irrigation scheme, which provides pumping and\nconveying facilities to draw and transfer water from the Yellow River\nto Yima City and Mianchi County to meet their acute rural, urban,\nand  industrial  water  demands,  and  to  supply  water  for  orchard\nirrigation and livestock uses.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $151.3 million equivalent, of\nwhich $66.1 million is the foreign exchange cost and $85.2 million\nequivalent is the local cost.\nFinancing Plan                   ($ million)\nSource Foreign  Local Total          Percentage\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB  64.3 \u2013 64.3 42\nLocal Sources 1.8            85.2          87.0 58\nTotal 66.1 85.2 151.3 100\nLoan Amount\nand Terms $64.3 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with a maturity\nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending\nrate system for US dollar loans, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent\nper annum, and a front-end fee of 1.0 percent.\nAllocation and\nRelending Terms The Ministry of Finance will onlend the ADB loan under the same\nterms and conditions to the provincial government of Henan. The\nProvincial Finance Bureau will relend the funds to municipal and\ncounty finance bureaus under the same terms and conditions.  End\nusers  (i.e.,  farm  households,  enterprises,  and  water  supply\ncompanies)  will  receive  loan  funds  from  the  relevant  finance\nbureaus at not less than commercial bank rates, under repayment\nterms based on profitability and cash-flow projections.\nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2006", "v\nExecuting Agency Provincial Government of Henan\nImplementing\nAgencies Bureaus of livestock, agriculture, and forestry; water supply and\nirrigation companies; and pilot enterprises\nImplementation\n Arrangements The Project Management Office (PMO) of the provincial government\nof Henan will implement the Project in conjunction with relevant\ntechnical agencies. An interagency leading group will coordinate and\noversee overall Project implementation and resolve policy issues.\nPMO will review and recommend specific activities for assistance\nunder the Project, prepare the annual work program and budget,\nand arrange procurement contracts.\nProcurement Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Each supply contract for plant and\nequipment, vehicles, and materials costing $500,000 or more will be\nawarded  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB);  that  for\nless than $500,000 but more than $100,000, through international\nshopping; and that for less than $100,000, by direct purchase.  Each\ncivil  works  contract  costing  $2  million  or  more  will  be  awarded\nthrough ICB.  Contracts for less than $2 million will be awarded\nthrough local competitive bidding, except that civil works relating to\nhorticulture and livestock components may be carried out through\nforce account, or through contracts awarded to village teams and\neligible  farmer  beneficiaries  (community  participation  in\nprocurement), where suitable.  ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme\nwill apply in procurement.  Advance procurement action for certain\nitems has been approved.\nConsulting Services No consulting services will be required.\nEstimated Project\n Completion Date 31 March 2006\nProject Benefits The Project will directly benefit about 204,900 households (almost\n and Beneficiaries 900,000 people). Nonfarm employment opportunities will be created\nin pig breeding and water supply. About 340,000 people will be lifted\nabove the rural poverty line of $1 per day and the urban poverty line\nof $2 per day.  At full development, household incomes will increase\nsignificantly,  with  incremental  household  net  incomes  averaging\nY1,631  in  horticulture  and  Y1,983  in  livestock.  Total  annual\nproduction  will  be  72,600  metric  tons  (t)  for  fruits,  2,640  t  for\nmedicinal plant products, and 197,900 t for vegetables. Livestock\ndevelopment  will  expand  annual  production  by  122,400  sheep,\n122,400  goats,  17,955  cattle,  and  68,000  pigs  (porkers).  Pilot\nlivestock  enterprises  will  produce  24,600  breeding  pigs,  25,000\npiglets, and 12,440 fattened and culled pigs. Annually, 83 million\ncubic meters of water will be supplied to various users.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the West Henan Agricultural Development\nProject.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. A feasibility study for the Project was carried out in 1995 under Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) technical assistance (TA).1 The study examined resource availability and use to identify\nthe  causes  of  low  rural  incomes  in  the  project  area,  and  made  proposals  for  sustainable\neconomic  development.  Subsequent  project  processing  over  several  years  allowed  careful\nassessment of issues related to project design and quality, implementation arrangements, and\npoverty targeting, thus improving project quality at entry.  A Fact-Finding Mission visited the\nPRC  in  February-March  1997,  with  follow-up  Fact-Finding/Consultation  Missions  in  August\n1998, January 1999, September 1999, and January 2000. The missions resulted in substantial\nscaling  down  of  the  Project,  removal  of  a  large  agroprocessing  component,  deletion  of\ncommercially risky components, focus reorientation toward poverty reduction, and change of the\nExecuting Agency (EA).   A small-scale TA2 approved in October 1999 updated the results of\nthe earlier studies and confirmed the technical assumptions. This TA was followed by an\nAppraisal Mission3 in April-May 2000. This report is based on the findings of ADB Missions, the\nADB-funded feasibility study and small-scale TA, as well as extensive discussions with national,\nprovincial, and local government officials, prospective local investors, target beneficiaries, and\nothers who may be affected by the Project.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1. The Agriculture and Rural Sector\n3. Poverty in the PRC is primarily a rural problem, although there are emerging pockets of\nurban poverty.4  In 1978, the household responsibility system was introduced, providing farmers\nwith greater incentives for production.  From 1978 to 1984, agricultural terms of trade were\nprogressively improved.  In combination, these measures brought down the number of the rural\npoor (based on national standards) from 260 million in 1978 to 89 million (11 percent of the\npopulation) in 1984.  By 1999, the official number of the rural poor had dropped to 34 million\n(under 3 percent of the population). Many of these poor households are located in areas that\nare relatively disadvantaged due to remoteness, climatic constraints, steep slopes or erosion, or\nsubject to frequent natural disasters.\n4. Agriculture, including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, and rural sideline activities,\nprovides an important source of income for about 200 million farm families and accounted for\n18.7 percent  of PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998. About 96.7 million hectares (ha)\n                  \n1  TA 2042-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development Project, for $600,000, approved on 29 December 1993.\n2  TA 3281-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development, for $150,000, approved on 26 October 1999.\n3 The Mission comprised Peter N. King (Mission Leader), Emile Gozali (Project Economist), David Sobel (Programs\nOfficer), Susanna Price (Senior Social Development Specialist), Christophe Gautrot (Counsel), Barry Deren (Staff\nConsultant \u2013 Economist), and Wu Guabao (Staff Consultant \u2013 Poverty Specialist).\n4 TA 3150-PRC: Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty Reduction Projects, for $715,000, approved on 31\nDecember 1998.", "2\nof PRC\u2019s land area of 960 million ha is cultivated(cid:190)7 percent of the world\u2019s farmland to support\n22 percent of its people. From 1990-1996, an average of 400,000 ha per year was converted\nfrom  agriculture  to  industrial,  infrastructure,  and  housing  use.  To  address  this  issue,  the\nGovernment  enacted  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law  to  protect  arable  land  and  limit\nconversion to other uses to 160,000 ha per year,5 with an equivalent amount of wasteland\nconverted to agricultural use. Because of the pressure on agricultural land, farming systems are\nintensive with heavy inputs of labor, chemical and organic fertilizers, small machinery, and\nwater. Intensive farming has allowed meeting the basic food requirements of the people along\nwith the development of a sophisticated mix of cash and commercial crops.\n5. The economic reform programs in agriculture undertaken in the late 1970s and early\n1980s provided successful examples later used in other sectors. The most important aspect of\nthe agriculture sector\u2019s reform program was the replacement of the commune system with a\nhousehold  contract  responsibility  system  in  which  plots  of  collectively  owned  land  were\nallocated to households under fixed-term contracts. The contract required the households to\nsupply the State with mandatory production quotas at fixed prices, with output above the quota\nallowed to be sold at market prices. State procurement prices were gradually increased, private\nplots were enlarged and contract periods extended, diversification of agricultural production was\nencouraged,  and  restrictions  on  rural  markets  and  nonagricultural  activities  were  relaxed.\nEconomic  reforms  also  encouraged  the  establishment  of  township  and  village  enterprises\n(TVEs), which are now an important part of the industrial structure and the major source of off-\nfarm employment for the surplus rural labor.\n6. The  reforms  successfully  improved  the  terms  of  trade  for  agriculture,  increased\nagricultural  production,  and  created  rural  employment,  particularly  during  1978-1984  when\nagricultural output grew by an annual average of 8.8 percent. However, agricultural growth\nslowed to an average 2.5 percent in 1984-1990 before recovering to 3.8 percent in the early\n1990s.    During  1988-1998,  agricultural  growth  averaged  4.4  percent,  well  in  excess  of\npopulation growth (less than 1 percent), but much lower than the overall GDP growth of 10.3\npercent. Agricultural growth is expected to remain at 3-4 percent per annum because of (i)\nunfavorable  terms  of  trade  for  agricultural  produce,  as  the  domestic  market  is  opened  to\ninternational competition following entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (ii) relatively\nlow investment in rural infrastructure; (iii) outflow of labor from agriculture to other sectors, (iv)\ncontinued decline in the area of cultivated land compounded by desertification and soil erosion;\n(v) fragmentation of landholdings; and (vi) recurrence of natural disasters such as floods and\ndrought.  Within  agriculture,  the  crop  subsector  has  experienced  the  greatest  slowdown.\nNevertheless,  food  grain  output  increased  by  1.7  percent  per  annum  during  1991-1998,\nreaching 512 million tons (t) in 1998, while population growth averaged less than 1 percent over\nthe  same  period.  Other  subsectors  (e.g.,  livestock,  fisheries,  and  horticulture),  where\nGovernment interventions are less and market forces play a greater role, are still growing\nrapidly at up to 10 percent per year.\n7. Early reform of the agriculture sector allowed rural incomes to rise rapidly so that the\nratio of urban to rural incomes fell from 2.3 in 1980 to 1.7 in 1984.  From the mid-1980s,\nhowever, the rural-urban income disparity increased to a ratio of 2.7 in 1999, when average per\ncapita urban income was Y5,854 compared with Y2,210 for rural income. From 1990 to 1993,\nannual urban income growth averaged 11.2 percent in real terms while rural income grew by 3.2\n                  \n5  In 1997, only 136,000 ha of cultivable land was reported to have been lost to other uses.", "3\npercent.6 Nonagricultural real rural income grew at 8.5 percent annually while real agricultural\nincomes remained almost constant, increasing by only 0.4 percent a year. From 1978 to 1998,\nthe share of crop farming in agricultural gross value output (GVO) fell from 80 percent to 58\npercent.  The contribution of all agricultural output to rural GVO fell from 74 percent in 1978 to\n47 percent in 1998, largely due to the rapid growth of TVEs. The widening gap between urban\nand farm incomes has provided compelling incentives for migration from rural to urban areas.\nThe income gap, coupled with the easing of restrictions on internal movements, has resulted in\nabout 100 million rural residents migrating to urban areas in the PRC.\n2. The Agriculture and Rural Sector in Henan\n8. Henan  Province  comprises  17  prefectures  with  112  counties  consisting  of  2,137\ntownships, and 46 districts under the jurisdiction of cities. The population is about 94 million\u2014\nthe largest among PRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions\u2014with 83 percent living in farm\nhouseholds. The arable land area is 6.8 million ha, 40 percent of the 16.7 million ha total land\narea, located mainly in the east of the province. Pasture covers about 0.3 million ha, forest\nabout 2.1 million ha, and wasteland and nonagricultural land about 7.3 million ha. Arable land\nper capita is 1.5 mu7 (0.1 ha)\u2014the national average is 2.1 mu, ranging from 0.8 mu in Fujian to\n8.2 mu in Heilongjiang  Province.  Henan is a major producer of wheat, corn, and cotton, mostly\ngrown under irrigated conditions on about 4.3 million ha. With an average annual rainfall of only\n785 millimeters and frequent droughts, productivity of field crops in non-irrigated lands is low.\nTree crops, both fruits and forest species, form an integral part of farming systems in the\nprovince, particularly in the mountainous western part.  In 1998, fruit orchards covered 385,000\nha and output was 3,126,000 t.  The orchards, mostly in West Henan, are in specific regions,\ndepending  on  tradition,  farmer  knowledge,  soil  type  and  climatic  conditions.  In  1999,  field\nvegetables covering 934,000 ha had an output of 31 million t and greenhouses in 133,300 ha\nproduced 12 million t of vegetables.\n9. Livestock is an important activity of farming households in counties with natural pastures\nand grassland. There are about 13 million cattle, 34.4 million pigs, 23.6 million goats, and 1.9\nmillion sheep in the province. Cattle production has been increasing due to higher meat prices\nand changing dietary preferences to include more protein as disposable incomes rise. Increased\nuse  is  being  made  of  by-products  from  wheat  and  other  crops  as  livestock  fodder.  Goat\nproduction has increased substantially because of the development of an export market for goat\nhide.\n10. Agriculture  contributes  about  one  quarter  of  the  provincial  GDP.  The  sector  has\nprogressively  increased  its  market  orientation.  By  1998,  the  value  of  agricultural  output\nmarketed had risen to 51 percent of total output; in the livestock subsector, the share was\nsubstantially higher.\n11. Henan is a relatively poor interior province.  Its rural agricultural population is poor\ncompared with the national rural population. In 1998, the per capita rural income in Henan was\nY1,864 ($225), 86 percent of the national rural average of Y2,162 ($260). Henan ranked 19th\namong PRC\u2019s 31 provinces and autonomous regions in terms of rural income. Average per\ncapita rural income in the province substantially varies, ranging from Y1,360 in Nanzhao County\n                  \n6  In nominal terms, average annual per capita incomes of rural households increased by 15.9 percent during 1990-\n1996, while urban incomes increased by 17.8 percent over the same period, reflecting the improved market\nconditions for agriculture post-1993.\n7  15 mu = 1 hectare.", "4\nto Y2,760 in Mengzhou County. Farming accounts for two thirds of the rural household income\nin the province; farm wages, and off-farm activities and employment account for the other third.\nOff-farm activities and employment in the 157,000 TVEs in Henan are important sources of\nfamily income in rural areas, often leaving women in charge of agricultural activities.\n3. Marketing and Agricultural Support Services in Henan\n12. The efficient marketing and movement of some commodities and processed products\nare constrained by inadequate infrastructure capacity in wholesale and retail market outlets,\ntransportation, storage, and processing. While the number of rural, urban, and city markets\nincreased in the 1990s in response to market changes, most have limited, if any, storage\nfacilities. The increased transportation of produce and goods to nonlocal markets has increased\nthe demand for investment in cost-effective, efficient transportation and improved road and rail\ninfrastructure.  The  provincial  government  of  Henan  (PGH)  is  currently  undertaking  major\ninfrastructure projects8 to overcome the transportation, storage, and processing constraints.\n13. The major sources of agricultural credit are the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), the\nAgricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC), and the rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). ABC\nis widely represented throughout the province, with 18 branches at the prefecture level, 213\nsubbranches at the county level, and 2,904 business offices at the township and village levels.\nIn 1998, the Henan ABC lent a total of Y56.3 billion ($6.8 billion), of which 59 percent was for\nrural commerce (for grain and cash crop purchases), infrastructure, and other commercial\nactivities; 23.1 percent for agriculture; and 17.9 percent for TVEs and industries. An ABC loan\ncovers part of the investment cost, and the borrower is expected to contribute up to 60 percent\nof the value of the investment. Accordingly, ABC loans are accessed mainly by the wealthier\nfarmers, who can provide fixed assets as collateral. In poor areas like West Henan, ABC\nprovides loans for poverty relief on behalf of the provincial Poverty Alleviation and Development\nOffice9 (PADO), at subsidized interest rates (3 percent in 1999).10 The main policy bank in rural\nareas, ADBC is responsible for providing credit for purchasing State quotas of grain, cotton, and\noil-bearing crops.\n14. Nonbanking finance institutions (NBFIs) provide an alternative source of credit (and\nsavings accounts) for farm households. About 25 percent of the capital available in Henan is\nheld in the NBFIs. The 7,437 RCCs in the province are the major sources of credit for individual\nfarmers. The RCCs cover 2,600 townships and have subbranches in 4,837 villages. About 55\npercent of rural households are RCC members who can secure credit on rates lower than for\nnonmember borrowers. RCC funds have not been used exclusively for investment in the rural\nareas. To rectify this, the RCC system was being reorganized with ADB assistance.11  Total\nlending by RCCs in 1996 was Y37 billion ($4.5 billion), comprising Y15.7 billion (42.4 percent)\nfor agriculture, Y15.6 billion (42.2 percent) for TVEs, and Y5.7 billion (15.4 percent) for other\ncommercial activities. Total lending by RCCs reached Y52 billion ($6.3 billion) in 1998. The\n                  \n8  The Xian-Hefei railway, funded by ADB, will pass through the project area.  In May 2000, the World Bank approved\n$150 million for a highway project to the southeast of the project area.\n9  PADO exists at national, provincial, prefecture, and county levels, and reports to the Leading Group Office on\nPoverty Alleviation and Development at the national and provincial levels, which in turn are under the leadership of\nthe State Council\u2019s Leading Group on Poverty Alleviation and Development.  The national PADO is located in the\nMinistry  of  Agriculture.  Under  provincial  government  restructuring,  PADO  may  be  renamed  as  Integrated\nAgricultural Development Office.\n10  Recovery rates from farm households are typically over 70 percent (although local officials claim higher rates),\nwhile loans to TVEs and county-owned enterprises (which was the policy during 1990-1996) had much lower\nrepayment rates (typically under 20 percent).\n11 TA  2214-PRC: Cooperative Banking Development, for $600,000, approved on 1 December 1994.", "5\naverage loan size of RCCs is much smaller than ABC loans, but the number of borrowers\nserved is much larger.\n15. Additional sources of credit in Henan include the Mutual Aid Fund for Disaster Relief and\nPoverty Alleviation (established under the Civil Affairs Department), Individual Laborer\u2019s Mutual\nAid  Fund  under  the  Industry  and  Commerce  Department,  and  Supply  and  Marketing\nCooperative (SMC) Share Service.  In a 1997 review, one county in West Henan had 246\nregistered NBFIs, although the actual number operating was much higher.  Most of the loans\noffered by these institutions are less than Y5,000, with maturities of less than six months, and\nhighly variable interest rates. Most NBFIs in rural areas have low operating costs, do not pay\ntaxes, and offer high interest rates on deposits (although officially prohibited) and hence have\ngrown quite rapidly in recent years, often attracting deposits from the official banking sector.\n16. Agricultural  research  services  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Henan  Academy  of\nAgricultural  Sciences  (HAAS),  which  operates  12  specialized  commodity  institutes,  a  well-\nequipped central research laboratory, and the Agricultural Science and Technology Information\nInstitute.12  At the field level, there are 17 research stations and 32 experimental stations. HAAS\nruns  a  comprehensive  program  on  breeding,  agronomy,  crop  production,  soil  fertility,  and\nintegrated pest management, and has achieved notable successes in breeding wheat, corn, and\npeanut  varieties.  The  Henan  Agricultural  University  (HAU)  also  plays  an  important  role  in\nresearch  and  breeding  programs.    For  livestock,  HAU  and  HAAS  have  comprehensive\nprograms  on  disease  control,  animal  breeding,  animal  husbandry,  and  fodder  production.\nLimited operational budgets are a key constraint in research activities.13  With the progressive\nimplementation of market reforms, some research units began undertaking semi-commercial\nseed multiplication, feed milling, and crop production in the 1990s to help generate research\nfunds.\n17. Extension  services  at  the  provincial,  prefecture,  county,  and  township  levels  are\nprovided for agriculture, forestry, horticulture, livestock, and aquaculture by the relevant line\nagencies. Each agency maintains at the township level a technical station that trains and\nsupervises the part-time farmer technicians who work at the village level. The townships fund\nthe technical stations. The level of funding and the quantity and quality of service depend on the\nability of the townships to pay. At the township, the ratio of technicians to farmers for horticulture\nis about 1:2,100, which improves to 1:318 when the part-time farmer technicians are included.14\nThe corresponding figures for livestock are 1:1,800 and 1:300, respectively. A major inadequacy\nin extension is the insufficient training, of technician and key farmers, to take full advantage of\ncurrent research results and convey this information to farmers with practical advice.\n18. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are progressively being established throughout\nthe PRC, and provide alternative sources of assistance to the rural poor in Henan.  Funding the\nPoor Cooperatives have been established at county and township levels in several experimental\nareas, to motivate qualified poor people to form small groups, deliver loans to members through\nsmall groups and centers, organize activities such as training and extension, collect due loans,\n                  \n12 ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, especially for\nlivestock and horticulture is generating results that are relevant to the PRC and Henan (e.g. TA 5812-REG: Third\nAgriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR Centers \u2013 Increasing Productivity of Crop-Livestock\nSystems in Asia (International Livestock Research Institute), for $1,000,000, approved on 1 October 1998).\n13 TA 3446-PRC: Study of Funding Options for Agricultural Research in PRC, for $150,000, approved on 25 May\n2000.\n14 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) uses a guideline of 1:500 as a satisfactory\nlevel of full-time staffing.", "6\nand monitor the working of the groups and centers.  One of two pilot microfinance schemes\nundertaken  in  Henan,  was  in  the  project  area,  in  Nanzhao  County.  Though  no  specific\norganization has been established in Henan, the Program of Happiness has operated projects\nin two poor counties to help poor mothers escape poverty. Project Hope has been a very\ninfluential poverty-related activity organized by the Communist Youth League.  From 1990 to\n1999, Project Hope in Henan raised about Y100 million and helped 96,377 child dropouts return\nto school. The Henan Women\u2019s Federation has organized 7,495 poor households in 21 poor\ncounties to operate microfinance-based income-generating activities. Another important activity\norganized by the Women's Federation is the Spring Bud Plan to help girl dropouts return to\nschool.  In the past six years, this plan has raised Y13.48 million and helped 65,000 girl\ndropouts return to schools. The Brilliant Cause was started in July 1994 in Henan to promote\nthe participation of private enterprises and other non-State-owned enterprises in the cause of\npoverty reduction.\n4. Recent Economic Development in Henan\n19. Despite being a poor interior province, Henan has actively implemented the national\neconomic reforms. Provincial GDP grew at an annual average rate of 10.9 percent during 1979-\n1998\u2014about equal to the national growth rate\u2014and currently stands at Y4,712 per capita,\nranking 18th in the PRC. GDP growth was led by services, industry, and agriculture, which grew\nat 14.5 percent, 12.8 percent, and 6.2 percent, respectively. In 1998, real GDP grew by 8.7\npercent, reaching Y435.7 billion ($52.5 billion) with output from agriculture reaching Y107 billion\n($12.9 billion). The rapid economic growth resulted in significant income increases for both rural\nand urban populations.  Since 1995, the growth rates in agricultural GVO (9 percent) and GDP\n(10 percent) in Henan have exceeded the national averages (5 percent, 8 percent).\n20. As in other agriculture-based interior provinces, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Henan\nhas been modest compared with that in coastal provinces. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan\n(1991-1995), FDI in the province totaled $1.4 billion. In 1998, it was $618 million. Most FDI is in\nthe industry and construction sectors and only a small amount is channeled to agriculture. To\nincrease FDI in agriculture and the rural areas and to achieve a better balance between urban\nand rural economic growth, the province is actively considering further incentives in the areas of\nland-use rights, land-use fees, income tax concessions, and agroprocessing.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n1. Agriculture\n21. The Government\u2019s medium-term sector objectives are to (i) increase food production to\nmeet the increase in demand resulting from the growth in population and income, and (ii)\nincrease rural incomes and employment opportunities to check the widening rural-urban income\ndisparities.  Given  the  arable  land  constraints  (0.1  ha  per  capita)  in  the  PRC,  the  sector\ndevelopment  strategy  focuses  on  increasing  productivity,  developing  underutilized  and\nunutilized lands, crop diversification, and adopting an integrated approach to farming. The\nstrategy also seeks to increase value added for agricultural produce and to create off-farm\nemployment opportunities.", "7\n22. The Ninth Five Year Plan (NYFP - 1996-2000) identified agricultural development as\nPRC\u2019s top priority.15 The key elements of the agricultural development plan include (i) protecting\narable land from urban/industrial encroachment and desertification; (ii) improving agricultural\nproduction technologies; (iii) improving support services and delivery of inputs and market\ninformation;  (iv)  enhancing  rural  infrastructure  including  irrigation,  drainage  facilities,  water\nsupply, and roads; (v) improving postharvest handling, storage, and distribution facilities; (vi)\nintegrating crop production with forestry, livestock, and aquaculture; (vii) providing production\nincentives to farmers by deepening agricultural reforms; and (viii) creating off-farm employment\nopportunities through the development of rural agroprocessing industries. The NYFP envisaged\na substantial increase in investments in agriculture and rural development, to be met through an\nincrease in the appropriations from the Government budget, supplemented by external funding.\nIn 1998, the Government committed itself to major increases in investment in forestry, water\nconservation,  and  poverty  relief  in  rural  areas.  In  1999,  it  affirmed  its  commitment  to\ndevelopment in the interior provinces, with focus on providing infrastructure and improving\nnatural resources management, to overcome an emerging prosperity gap between coastal and\ninterior regions.  At the crossroads between east and west, north and south in the PRC, Henan\nstands to benefit indirectly from the Government plan to accelerate development in the western\nprovinces over the next decade.\n23. To  reduce  rural  poverty,  Henan  has  focused  its  agricultural  and  rural  development\nassistance  on  the  following  programs:  (i)  intensifying  lowland  agriculture,  particularly  grain\nproduction, through increased investment in rural infrastructure and improved support services;\n(ii) promoting sustainable agricultural development for poor communities in uplands, by adopting\nsoil  conservation  measures  and  diversifying  crop  production;  (iii)  improving  postharvest\nhandling, storage, and marketing of both grain and nongrain produce; and (iv) promoting rural\nindustries  to  generate  off-farm  employment  opportunities  for  poor  rural  communities  and\nsupporting downstream processing facilities.\n2. Poverty Reduction\n24. PRC\u2019s national poverty reduction program was introduced in 1985. The program was\ndesigned to attack absolute poverty and set an official poverty line at an annual average per\ncapita net income of Y150 ($18) and a grain ration of 200 kilograms. The Seventh Five-Year\nPlan (1986-1990) incorporated explicit poverty reduction measures for poverty counties through\nincome generation, relief aid, preferential taxes, and targeted assistance based on income\ncriteria. The program identified 328 poverty counties for national Government assistance. Since\n1985, progress in reducing poverty has been substantial. The number of people classified as\nabsolute  poor  declined  from  125  million  in  1985  to  80  million  in  1993.  In  July  1993,  the\nGovernment  initiated  the  Eight-Seven  Poverty  Alleviation  Campaign  to  lift  the  80  million\nabsolute poor above the poverty line during the remaining seven years of the century.\n25. The majority of the poor live in rural areas, mostly in areas with limited natural resources,\npoor agricultural land, limited off-farm employment opportunities, and inadequate physical and\nsocial infrastructure. The strategic thrust of the poverty alleviation campaign was to promote\nintegrated socioeconomic development and human resource development in areas where the\npoor are concentrated. The campaign has been successful and the number of the absolute poor\n                  \n15 The Tenth Five Year Plan (2001-2005) will continue this emphasis, as the Government is concerned about\nemerging disparities between coastal and interior areas and between rural and urban areas.  The Tenth Plan\nperiod will see major Government investment in the western portion of the PRC. Through its location at the\ncrossroads of the national transportation system, Henan stands to benefit indirectly from this investment.", "8\nat the end of 1999 was estimated at about 34 million. It is recognized that about 20 million will\nremain very difficult to reach under existing programs by the end of 2000.  The Tenth Five-Year\nPlan (2001-2005) will continue to emphasize poverty reduction. The central Government is\ncurrently mapping out a poverty reduction and development program that targets western PRC,\nethnic  minority  areas,  and  regions  lacking  in  resources.    Infrastructure  construction,\nenvironmental protection, and social infrastructure (health, education, housing) will be priority\nprojects for the impoverished areas.\n26. While national attempts to assist the absolute poor have been successful, the narrow\nincome definition of the national poverty line (about $0.66 per day on a purchasing power parity\nbasis) does not take account of poverty\u2019s wider characteristics.  Adoption of a wider definition\nrequires, in addition to income, attention to education, gender equality, infant and maternal\nmortality, health care, housing, and environmental sustainability. A logical next step in the\nGovernment\u2019s drive to eliminate rural poverty would entail recognition of relative income poverty\nand a commensurate shift in the poverty line, to the international standard of $1 per day or the\nbottom 10 percent of the population in terms of income (both currently around Y1,000 per capita\nper annum).16  Estimates for the year 2000 indicate that 106 million people fall below this\npoverty line; therefore the task of reducing poverty remains substantial.\n27. At the international poverty line of $1 per day per person (adjusted for purchasing power\nparity), the incidence of poverty in Henan was 13 percent in 1997, with about 10 million people\nbelow this line (more than 2.5 times the absolute poverty incidence). In 1998, this proportion\nwas reduced slightly to 11.2 percent of the population (10.5 million people). About half of these\npoor families live in West Henan. The poverty threshold is marginally above the basic grain\nrequirements, so many households with incomes above it still lack basic livelihood needs and\nmay slide back to poverty in a bad crop year or after natural disasters.\n28. Previously, most of the poor in Henan were located in the 28 officially designated\nnational poverty counties, including the 12 poor counties in West Henan (see map), as well as\nsix province-designated poverty counties. Due to the success of the poverty reduction program,\nhowever, nonpoverty counties now have 47.6 percent of the total absolute poor rural population\nin Henan (an increase from 31.3 percent in 1993). Even in the poorer western counties of\nHenan, substantial differences in the incidence of relative poverty occur\u2014from 23 percent in\nSongxian to 1 percent in Mianchi. The majority of the poor counties are concentrated in difficult\nareas: high mountains, dry rolling hills, waterlogged gullies, sandbanks of Yellow River basins,\nand regions of endemic diseases such as goiter. The province is placing priority on removing\nthese pockets of rural poverty, using more location-specific criteria in determining development\npriorities and targeting development assistance at poor village and household levels. Since the\nearly 1980s, designated poverty counties have received about Y5 billion in poverty reduction\nfunds. In 1998, new programs were developed to target poor households in nonpoor counties.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n29. At the end of 1997, 7,896 foreign-funded agriculture projects sector in the PRC, involved\n$12 billion in foreign capital (Appendix 1). Since 1985, the World Bank, the main source of\nexternal  assistance  to  agriculture,  has  provided  11  loans  amounting  to  $250  million  for\nagriculture projects covering Henan Province for (i) land development, irrigation, and drainage;\n(ii)  agriculture  support  service  improvement;  (iii)  development  of  specialized  subsectors,\n                  \n16 Emerging urban poverty suggests that $3 per day in coastal cities and $2 per day in interior cities may be\nappropriate urban poverty lines, pending additional study by ADB.", "9\nincluding forestry, livestock, and horticulture; and (iv) area development projects. All of the\nWorld Bank lending to agriculture and rural development has used concessional funds under\nthe International Development Association (IDA). The World Bank has successfully supported\nprovince-level multicomponent area development projects, aimed partly at poverty reduction,\nwhich were prepared and implemented by local governments.\n30. The latter category of projects includes the $110 million Henan Agricultural Development\nProject (HADP), which commenced in May 1991 and was completed in 1999.  HADP covered\n20 counties in the northern and eastern part of Henan (along the Yellow River) and comprised\n11 agroprocessing plants, 16 seed processing plants, and livestock and horticulture. The World\nBank evaluated project progress and presented to the project to other provinces as a model.\nThe accounting system of the World Bank project was extended to other provinces, and the\nProject Management Office (PMO) was praised for its efficiency and professionalism. The\nproject completion report noted project success for all components, with greenhouses and\nlivestock exceeding the targets. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at\n40 percent, compared with 35.8 percent at appraisal.\n31. Throughout the PRC, the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has\nsupported  six  projects  for  $161  million,  and  the  World  Food  Programme  (WFP)  has\nimplemented 11 projects for $174 million. In Henan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations (FAO) completed two fruit processing projects with a total investment of\n$15.1 million, and WFP funded a farmland rehabilitation project, with investments of $16.6\nmillion.\n32. Japan  previously  provided  foreign  assistance  through  the  Japan  International\nCooperation Agency (JICA, for TAs) and the former Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund\n(OECF, for loans). In Henan, JICA supported a project for the rehabilitation of rice fields ($3\nmillion). A fruit processing project in the province was financed by a Japanese NGO. Germany\u2019s\ndevelopment assistance to the PRC is mainly related to environment/forestry and one project\ntargets poverty reduction in Henan. The Netherlands is assisting the province with a livestock\nproject focused on dairy cattle.  The United Kingdom financed a $7.1 million duck raising project\nin the province.\n33. ADB\u2019s operation in the agriculture sector in the PRC commenced in 1988. To date, ADB\nhas provided $779.6 million to finance eight projects (10 loans). The loans were complemented\nby 53 TAs totaling $31 million for institutional strengthening, enterprise reform, environmental\nmanagement,  poverty  reduction,  and  project  preparation.  This  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first\nagricultural project in Henan Province.\n D. Governance and Lessons Learned\n34. The PRC has demonstrated strong project implementation capability.  Most projects in\nADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio  have  been  implemented  efficiently,  with  some  completed  ahead  of\nschedule.  There  is  a  strong  sense  of  project  ownership  at  local  levels  and  consequent\ncommitment to effective implementation. Other factors that have contributed to efficient project\nimplementation include (i) rigorous screening of projects proposed for ADB assistance to ensure\nfinancial viability, debt servicing capability, and adequate provision of counterpart funds; (ii)\neffective  interagency  coordination;  (iii)  well-developed  institutional  arrangements  for  project\nimplementation; (iv) good technical skills in the EAs; and (v) strong emphasis on anticorruption\nat all levels of government. The strategic use of TA to upgrade the capabilities of EAs and", "10\nholding of seminars and workshops to familiarize EA staff with ADB\u2019s procedures and practices\nhave also contributed to good project quality.\n35. Despite this overall satisfactory performance, the performance of individual projects in\nthe agriculture sector has been mixed.  Of the eight ADB-assisted agriculture projects, two (ABC\nand Hexian pulpmill) have been completed and postevaluated, four are at various stages of\nimplementation (Guangdong tropical crops, Yunnan-Simao forestation and sustainable wood\nutilization, ABC II, and Fujian soil conservation and rural development), one  (Hainan agriculture\nand natural resources development) may be canceled, and one (North China marine culture and\ncoastal resources management) lapsed before effectiveness due to closure of the financial\nintermediary.\n36. Postevaluation of the ABC project concluded that the project was generally successful,\nachieved its objectives, and was efficiently implemented. Two projects (Hainan and North China\nmarine culture) demonstrated that institutional arrangements need to be carefully worked out\nand  the  financial  performance  and  viability  of  financial  intermediaries  must  be  carefully\nassessed.  The Hexian pulpmill project, completed in October 1994, demonstrates the need to\ncarefully assess production targets, quality goals, and financial viability. The project was ranked\nunsuccessful during postevaluation. The problems can be attributed to some technical errors\nand omissions in the process design, using a technology that was relatively new in the PRC,\nand  inadequate  arrangements  for  transfer  of  the  process  technology.17  Yunnan-Simao  is\nexperiencing serious implementation difficulties, which confirm the need to carefully assess the\neconomic viability and sustainability of the project benefits for State-sponsored agroprocessing\nenterprises.\n37. The 1998 Country Assistance Program Evaluation report for the PRC found that ADB\noperations in the agriculture sector over the period 1986-1997 had not achieved significant\nperformance  in  relation  to  the  strategic  sectoral  objectives  espoused  in  the  1991  Country\nOperational Strategy. Less than satisfactory performance appears to be associated with State-\nowned agroprocessing industries,18 where the Government engaged in directed lending and\nattempted  to  pick  winners  in  a  rapidly  changing  sector,  that  is  increasingly  exposed  to\ninternational competition.  Projects that promoted direct Government investment in agricultural\nproduction  and  private  sector  involvement  in  downstream  processing  (such  as  Fujian  and\nGuangdong tropical crops) were more successful. These lessons have been incorporated in the\ndesign of subsequent projects, including the proposed Project, which is partly modeled on the\nFujian soil conservation and rural development project.19\n38. Several World Bank postcompletion reviews of agriculture projects20 have also been\ndrawn upon for lessons learned to be applied in the project design. The projects reviewed are\nmulticomponent projects implemented in many counties and in more than one province, and are\ntherefore similar to the proposed Project in design. The postcompletion reviews do not cite\n                  \n17 These problems were partly addressed under TA 2574-PRC: Capacity Building for Hexian Pulpmill, for $600,000,\napproved on 24 May 1996.\n18For these reasons, an agroprocessing component that would have supported 19 agroprocessing plants was\ndeleted from the project scope during processing.\n19 The main similarities are funding through relevant line agencies, terracing and soil conservation measures prior to\nestablishing tree crops in sloping areas, and strong linkages with provincial research and extension systems.\n20 Credit 1261-CHA: North China Plain Agricultural Development Project, Impact Evaluation Report, June 1994 and\nPAR No.7736, April 1989; Loan 2579-CHA: Pishihang-Chaohu Area Development Project, PCR Report No.12013,\nJuly 1993; Credit 1733-CHA: Red Soil Area Development Project, PAR No.12033, June 1993 and PCR No.11691,\nFebruary 1993; and Loan 2261-CHA and Credit 1347-CHA: Heilongjiang Land Reclamation Project, PAR No.\n10657, May 1992.", "11\ncomplexity  of  multicomponent  and  multilocation  projects  as  a  significant  problem,  largely\nbecause  of  strong  commitment  from  local  levels,  strong  project  management  offices  at\nprovincial  levels,  and  the  active  participation  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  findings,  however,\nhighlight a need for (i) flexibility in project design to respond to site-specific technical problems\nand rapid market changes, and (ii) specific measures to ensure poverty reduction impacts by\nproviding increased extension and support to farmers.\n39. The  implementation  completion  report  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  HADP  found  that  an\nintegrated system linking production, processing, and marketing was the cornerstone of the\nproject\u2019s success. The model of linking companies to farm households benefited both parties\nand reduced market risks. Introduction of advanced technologies enabled products to compete\nsuccessfully in the marketplace. On average, farmer net per capita income increased from Y550\nto  Y2,179  in  the  project  area  an  annual  growth  rate  of  25.8  percent,  compared  with  the\nprovincial average of 21.5 percent over the same period.  It was noted, however, that several of\nthe agroprocessing plants were running into difficulty in obtaining adequate operating funds,\nthus raising questions of sustainability.\n40. The Project design and implementation arrangements took these findings into account\nand provide for (i) a midterm review of the Project to assess implementation status, review the\nproject parameters, and take appropriate measures to ensure achievement of the objectives; (ii)\nstrengthening of extension services and training; (iii) beneficiary selection criteria giving priority\nto the poorer members of the local community; (iv) structuring assistance packages so that they\nare attractive and affordable to poor households, and allow them to progressively expand their\nfarm  operations  through  repeat  lending;  and  (v)  pilot  testing  the  company  +  household\nenterprise  model  as  a  potential  model  for  future  lending  in  the  sector,  rather  than  the\ncornerstone of the Project as originally envisaged.\nE. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy\n41. ADB\u2019s overarching objective is poverty reduction. In pursuit of this objective, ADB\u2019s\noperational strategy for the PRC emphasizes three broad objectives: (i) improving economic\nefficiency,  (ii)  promoting  growth  to  reduce  poverty  in  inland  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhancing\nenvironmental  protection  and  natural  resources  management.  For  agriculture,  the  country\noperational strategy focuses on (i) increasing efficiency in agricultural production, processing,\nand marketing; (ii) reducing rural poverty and increasing rural income opportunities through\ncash crops and off-farm employment; (iii) improving management and development of soil,\nwater, forest, and marine resources for sustainable development; (iv) supporting the transition to\na market economy through improved incentives for private sector investment and establishment\nof market information systems; and (v) supporting enterprise reforms.\n42. Agricultural projects are also designed to simultaneously address crosscutting concerns,\nparticularly  poverty  reduction,  improving  natural  resource  management,  and  environmental\nprotection.  ADB\u2019s operations are designed to help reduce the disparity in incomes between\nrural and urban areas by facilitating the development of efficient markets in agricultural goods\nand  improving  incentives  for  agricultural  production,  including  improved  land  tenure  and\ntransfer.\n43. Most of PRC\u2019s poor live in resource-constrained inland provinces like Henan, which have\nnot  received  the  special  incentives  provided  to  coastal  provinces  to  accelerate  economic\ngrowth. Instead of encouraging preferential incentives that tend to exacerbate or create new\nfactor market distortion and misallocation of resources, ADB\u2019s strategic thrust to reduce poverty", "12\nin inland provinces is to help (i) promote market-based policy changes to attract more foreign\nand  domestic  investments;  (ii)  address  infrastructure  and  institutional  constraints  to  rural\ndevelopment;  (iii)  develop  integrated  agriculture  and  agrobased  industries;  (iv)  develop\ntransportation, communications, and marketing linkages between the interior provinces and the\ncoast; and (v) locate development projects in poverty counties or in areas where the average\nincome is well below the national average (and below the $1 per day poverty line).\n F. Policy Dialogue\n1. Land Use and Land Tenure Reform\n44. A critical factor in rural poverty reduction is access to adequate land resources.  Land\nuse and land tenure in Henan are covered by the provincial regulations within the broad policy\nframework  of  the  national  Government.21  Accordingly,  an  important  step  in  reducing  rural\npoverty  is  reform  of  the  legal  framework  covering  land  use  and  land  tenure.22  The  Land\nAdministration Law, drafted with ADB assistance, became effective on 1 January 1999. The law\nprovides for a national land use plan, which will stipulate the total amount of arable land to be\nput under protection. After the State Council approves this plan, every province, county and\ntownship will be assigned quotas of arable land for protection. The area of cultivated land\nshould comprise more than 80 percent of the arable land. Any arable land that is unavoidably\nrequired  for  urban/industrial  expansion  must  be  replaced  by  a  similar  area  of  wasteland\nreclaimed by the project proponent. Each local government area will be required to work out its\nown plans to protect arable land, with standards no less strict than those set by the State.\n45. ADB assisted Sichuan Province to draft a model enabling provincial law,23 which could\nbe applied nationwide, and the findings were discussed with PGH. The new Sichuan land law\nmakes  changes  in  four  significant  areas:  (i)  registration  of  land  rights  and  issuance  of\ncertificates by which landholders can confirm their rights against intrusions by other landholders\nand claimants, and against arbitrary actions by State or local agencies; (ii) local government\nresponsibilities to prepare the overall land use plans, with plans prepared by one level of local\ngovernment and submitted to the next higher level for approval; (iii) formulas for payments for\nrural land undergoing conversion to urban construction land, based on the measurement of the\nproductivity  of  the  rural  land  being  acquired,  and  full  compensation  for  collective  farm\norganizations and individual families; and (iv) citizen participation in the processes of land use\nplanning and in the procedures for conversion of rural land to urban uses. A national supervision\nand inspection system for land resources and land occupation will be set up under the Ministry\nof Land and Resources. PGH has prepared implementing guidelines for the Land Administration\nLaw, which are similar to those prepared for Sichuan Province. Under the Project, a specific\ncovenant ensures that tree crops are not established on protected arable land, cultivation will\nnot be permitted on slopes greater than 25 degrees, and long-term leases will be assured for all\nbeneficiaries (30-50 years, depending on type of crop and land quality).\n                  \n21 ADB assistance has been provided under TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for\n$800,000, approved on 24 December 1996. At the provincial level, land use and tenure were addressed under TA\n2408-PRC: Land Use and Land Use Tenure Policy in Fujian Province, for $600,000 approved on 28 September\n1995.\n22\nThe need for a transparent land title registration system is one of the lessons of the Hainan Agriculture Project.\nUnder that project, one of the problems was the difficulty ascertaining the legal ownership of the assets claimed by\nthe implementing agencies.\n23TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Conservation, for\n$300,000, approved on 15 December 1998.", "13\n2. Poverty Reduction\n46. The nature of poverty in the PRC is changing, with large income gaps opening up\nbetween rural and urban areas, and with many of the remaining absolute poor living in remote\nmountainous areas, where provision of adequate infrastructure is uneconomic and delivery of\nsocial services is difficult.24  Also, with the restructuring of inefficient State-owned enterprises\n(SOEs), there is an emerging class of urban poor, which is potentially destabilizing and, hence,\nis  attracting  increased  attention  through  provision  of  an  adequate  social  safety  net.    The\nGovernment  had  previously  opted  not  to  make  extensive  use  of  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources (OCR) funds for poverty reduction, arguing that financial returns should be high,\nrelatively short term, and capable of full cost recovery with a premium to cover market and\nforeign  exchange  risks.    The  previous  availability  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  IDA  concessional\nresources led the Government to be less inclined to use ADB\u2019s OCR resources in agriculture.\nAccordingly, a major aspect of the policy dialogue was to reach an understanding with the\nGovernment that ADB\u2019s OCR resources could be applied successfully to poverty reduction\nprojects in the PRC.\n47. Despite its status as a poor province, Henan has been paying much attention to the\nsocial security of rural dwellers by providing access roads to poor villages; promoting applied\ntechnologies in poor areas to increase incomes; providing special funds for children who have\ndropped out of school; and providing vocational, technical, and skills training in poor areas.  The\ncommitment to rural infrastructure in poor areas is consistent with the policy dialogue conducted\nunder TA 3150-PRC (footnote 3), which emphasized that provision of roads in rural areas\n(carefully bundled with other essential services) is one of the most effective means of combating\npoverty by providing poor farmers with access to markets as well as to social services.  As a\nresult of this policy dialogue with PGH, the project design has focused on targeting the poor,\nand the involved Government agencies are now eager to demonstrate that ADB\u2019s OCR funds\ncan also be used for poverty reduction.\n3. Environmental Protection\n48. The economic loss attributable to pollution and associated degradation of PRC\u2019s natural\nresources is estimated at between 3.5 and 7.7 percent of GDP. Environmental improvement has\nbeen  a  constant  item  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  agenda  for  the  PRC.  ADB  has  provided  TA  for\nstrengthening the institutional capacities of the Government agencies responsible for assessing\nand monitoring environmental impacts and formulating environmental protection laws.25 ADB\n                  \n24 In 1997, the income ratio between the 10 percent of households with the highest income and the lowest 5 percent\nof financially stressed families in PRC's cities and towns was 4.7:1. In the same year, 5 percent of the rural\nhouseholds had an average per capita annual net income of over Y5,000, while 4.4 percent had less than Y600 per\ncapita. The ratio between the 5 percent of rural residents at the upper level and 5 percent of those at the lower\nlevel was about 8.3:1.\n25TA 987-PRC: Institutional Strengthening of the National Environmental Protection Agency, for $340,000, approved\non June 1988; TA 1436-PRC: Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Training, for 600,000, approved on 10\nDecember 1990; TA 1988-PRC: EIA Training Phase II, for $900,000, approved on 18 November 1993; and TA\n2090-PRC: Legislative Reform for Protecting the Environment and Natural Resources, for $500,000, approved on\n18 May 1994; TA 2975-PRC: Environmental Impact Assessment Training and Curriculum Development, for\n$600,000, approved on 31 December 1997; TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and\nNatural Resources Conservation,  for $300,000, approved on 15 December 1998; TA 3290-PRC: Capacity Building\nin Ministerial Status Responsibilities in State Environmental Protection Administration, for $810,000, approved on 8\nNovember 1999.", "14\nhas  also  provided  TA  for  soil  and  water  conservation,  forest  and  grassland  ecosystems\nconservation, and agro-industrial pollution control.26\n49. The  major  environmental  concerns  in  Henan  are  soil  and  water  conservation  and\nindustrial pollution. The province, with the assistance of the national Government, has been\nimplementing various measures for soil and water conservation, particularly in the Yellow River\ncatchment and the loess27 areas. The horticulture component of the proposed Project will\ncontribute to the ongoing efforts to conserve soil and water in the loess region.\n50. The TA on efficient utilization of agricultural wastes28 reflects conclusions from the study\non rural energy development,29 which was completed in 1996, and the TA for renewable energy\ndevelopment.30 These two TAs recommended an integrated agricultural development approach\nto improve the environment and livelihood of farm households in rural PRC through more\nefficient  utilization  of  agricultural  waste  products  to  produce  low-cost  and  cleaner  energy\nsources,  and  improve  agricultural  production.  Utilization  of  agricultural  wastes  has  been\nincorporated into the livestock component of the Project, through use of ammoniated straw as\nlivestock feed, and use of piggery wastes to generate methane for heating in winter.\n51. PGH has been very serious in combating industrial pollution. Thousands of small and\nmedium-size polluting industrial enterprises were closed and many medium-size and large\nindustries paid penalties. Policy dialogue during project design resulted in the assurance that\nindustrial units to benefit from the water supply subcomponent will be connected only if they\nmeet the national standards for industrial emission, wastewater treatment, and solid waste\ndisposal. It was also agreed that polluting industries upstream of the regulating reservoir would\nbe closed to protect the quality of the stored water and reduce treatment costs.\n4. Water Tariff Rationalization\n52. The continued strong growth of the economy has caused water demand to outstrip\nsupply in most parts of the PRC, especially along the Yellow River, where the Project is located.\nThe gap between demand and supply is widening, and the situation is exacerbated by the\noverall  shortage  of  freshwater  sources  in  many  regions  and  the  inefficient  use  of  water,\nparticularly in agriculture. It is increasingly recognized that financing of water supply schemes\nand  pricing  of  water  need  to  be  changed  to  generate  funds  for  subsequent  investment\nrequirements,  provide  market-based  incentives  to  effectively  manage  water  demands,  and\nprovide incentives for commercially oriented water companies to improve their efficiency. ADB\nhas funded TA31 for formulating appropriate guidelines and policies in the water sector, which\nhave led to the adoption of National Guidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT) and mechanisms for\ntheir implementation, and is continuing assistance in this area. Major TA recommendations\nreflected in the NGWT include (i) selection of a tariff structure based on local conditions; (ii) a\ntwo-part tariff with a volumetric and fixed demand charge; (iii) adoption of full cost recovery as\n                  \n26TA 2073-PRC: Chang Jiang Soil and Water Conservation and Environmental  Protection, for $600,000, approved\non 24 March 1994; TA 2119-PRC: Forest  Ecosystem Planning and Agro-industrial Pollution Control, for $600,000,\napproved on 30 June 1994; TA 2156-PRC: Improvement of Grassland Ecosystem in North China, for $746,000,\napproved on 16 September 1994; and TA 2407-PRC: Capacity Building for Soil and Water Conservation, for\n$590,000, approved on 28 September 1995.\n27 Loess is yellowish brown loamy soil, usually unstratified and prone to rain and wind erosion.\n28 TA 3370-PRC: Efficient Use of Agricultural Wastes, for $703,000, approved on 26 December 1999.\n29 TA 2100-PRC:Rural Energy Development Study, for $500,000, approved on 16 June 1994.\n30 TA 3056-PRC:Renewable Energy Development, for $656,000, approved 19 August 1998.\n31 TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997, and TA 2773\u2013\nPRC: Water Supply Tariff Study, for $600,000, approved on 24  March 1997.", "15\nthe main objective in setting and approving tariff levels; and (iv) adoption of a simplified process\nfor tariff regulation, requiring evaluation and approval at the local level and supported by review\nand monitoring at the provincial and State levels.\n53. To recover the full cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) and a reasonable portion\nof the investment cost, water tariffs in Henan have been increased substantially since the mid-\n1990s, particularly in water-deficit areas. For example, in Sanmenxia City within the project\narea, the tariff for industrial water increased from Y0.35/cubic meter (m3) in 1990 to Y2.00-\n4.00/m3  in  1997.  During  project  processing,  on  ADB\u2019s  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  were\ndevelopment  of  a  better  balance  between  public  water  supply  and  private  access  to\ngroundwater, introduction of higher tariffs for groundwater extraction, installation of wastewater\ntreatment facilities whenever urban water supplies are increased, and water tariffs to include the\ninvestment and operating costs for wastewater treatment systems.  As a result of this policy\ndialogue, the project water authorities agreed that water tariffs will be set at levels ensuring the\nfull recovery of both capital investment and O&M costs, and a reasonable return on investment.\nIt was also agreed that the Project would provide for investment in water supply systems, water\ntreatment plants and wastewater treatment, and water-saving irrigation systems, in a phased\ndevelopment program.\n5. Enterprise Reform\n54. Promoting enterprise reform is a strategic objective of ADB\u2019s PRC operations. ADB has\nencouraged company restructuring to introduce shareholding with diversified ownership. The\nmain  thrust  of  the  policies  is  to  introduce  a  modern  enterprise  structure,  focus  on  profit\norientation, and increase managerial autonomy and accountability. In the project area, this\npolicy  advice  is  directly  related  to  agricultural  enterprises  where  improved  management\ncapabilities,  attention  to  product  quality  and  competitive  pricing,  and  enhanced  marketing\nanalysis are needed.  Experience has shown that private ownership of agricultural enterprises in\nthe PRC has been a significant factor in profitability.  The supply and marketing cooperatives,\nwhich link the State and farmers in over 30,000 cooperatives nationwide, have incurred losses\namounting to Y32.2 billion ($3.88 billion) since 1992 and must be reformed. In January 1999,\nthe State Council announced that local governments should sever their ties with business\noperations. Accordingly, the Project targets four private sector pilot enterprises to demonstrate\nthe future role of corporate production systems with export potential, which can mobilize groups\nof farmers and provide them with technical advice and inputs.\n6. Governance and Anticorruption\n55. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Procurement, particularly the need for bidders/suppliers/contractors to observe\nthe highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB financed contracts,\nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions\nadded to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed. The PRC Country\nAssistance Program includes assistance to the Government that will improve governance and\nprovide incentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. In 1998, ADB TA\nrelated to the consulting industry and auditing addressed some of the elements of ADB\u2019s\nanticorruption  policy.  Under  TA  3138,32  ADB  consultants  are  assisting  the  Government  in\n                  \n32TA  3138-PRC: Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\nDecember 1998.", "16\ndeveloping detailed guidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants, which increase\ntransparency, take account of the principles of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, and provide for\nequal opportunity competition. TA 310333 will strengthen the Government's auditing system to\nconform with the requirements of the Audit Law and, as far as practicable, of international\nauditing standards by helping to (i) formulate government auditing standards and procedures,\nand  (ii)  design  and  implement  an  audit-training  program  to  promote  full  and  consistent\nadherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and  procedures  by  government  auditors.  When\ncompleted, this work should strengthen the Government's ability to detect fraud and corruption.\n56. The Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted\nwell-publicized campaigns against official corruption. Under TA 2845,34 assistance was provided\nto  draft  procurement  regulations  and  standard  bidding  documents.  The  six  sets  of  draft\nregulations and the three sets of sample bidding documents produced under the TA contain\nprovisions related to corrupt or fraudulent practices, in accordance with ADB\u2019s anticorruption\npolicy. Under this TA, ADB provided comments on the draft of a national Law on Tendering and\nBidding of the PRC (adopted at the 11th Session of the Standing Committee of the Ninth\nNational People's Congress on 30 August 1999, promulgated by Order No. 21 of the President\nof the PRC on 30 August 30 1999) that became effective as of 1 January 2000. The law\nstipulates that tender and bidding activities will follow the principles of openness, fairness,\nimpartiality, and good faith (Article 5). This law covers key construction projects funded by the\nState and all externally funded projects. Article 6 stipulates that \u201cno organizations or persons\nshall, by any means, limit or exclude legal persons or other organizations outside from other\nregions or systems from participating in the bidding procedure. No illegal interference in any\nform is permitted in the bidding process.\u201d Article 32 specifically prohibits bribes and collusion,\nwhile Articles 49-64 specify appropriate sanctions for all abuses of the law, including substantial\nfines and criminal prosecution.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n57. Henan is a relatively poor interior province (ranking 18th in the PRC), with GDP per\ncapita of Y4,356 in 1998, compared with the national average of Y6,392.  The rural economy in\nthe western part of the province is the most disadvantaged.  West Henan accounts for about\none third of the province\u2019s land area and one fifth of its population. The high population density\n(340 persons per square kilometer (km2), hilly to mountainous terrain (79 percent of land area),\nscarce arable land (0.07 ha per capita), climatic extremes, lack of infrastructure, and limited\nwater resources have impeded economic development and kept farmers poor.35\n58. High population density has resulted in intensive cultivation of crops on 40 percent of the\nland area in West Henan, which comprises highly fragile loess soils. The resulting extensive soil\nerosion causes downstream environmental degradation and reduces land productivity. The\nprovince has been attempting since the 1980s to increase agricultural production and control\nsoil  erosion,  through  development  of  temperate  fruit,  nut,  and  medicinal  plant  tree  crops.\nLivestock development has been promoted in 20 of the 32 project area counties that have\n                  \n33TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.\n34 TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on\n20 August 1997.\n35 These resource constraints have resulted in 12 percent poverty incidence (at $1 per day) exceeding the national\nand provincial averages; 12 of the 32 project area counties are officially designated poverty counties; and 42\npercent of the rural poor reside outside the poverty counties.", "17\n200,000 ha of natural pastures. West Henan has emerged as a major supplier of beef, pork, and\nmutton to domestic and export markets. These horticulture and livestock programs have been\nsuccessful in raising farm incomes, a contributing factor in the selection of West Henan as the\nlocation for ADB\u2019s first poverty-related project in agriculture in the PRC.\n59. The inability to access medium- and long-term rural credit has limited the ability of poor\nfarmers to move out of subsistence farming through investment in cash crop and livestock\ndevelopment.  This  problem  has  also  constrained  the  development  of  downstream\nagroprocessing  and  marketing  by  agro-industrial  enterprises(cid:190)especially  in  the  private\nsector(cid:190)which are needed to create an effective demand for the farmers\u2019 produce, maintain high\nfarm-gate prices, and generate off-farm employment opportunities. Credit constraints and the\nlack of fixed assets collateral hinder the Government\u2019s strategic effort to integrate agricultural\nproduction with agroprocessing and marketing.36  Accordingly, the Government offers poor\nhouseholds credit requiring no fixed collateral, so that they may establish a credit history and\ngraduate to commercial credit sources for future expansion of their farm enterprises.  The key\nchallenge  to  the  Project  is  to  demonstrate  that  subsidized  credit  is  not  needed  by  poor\nhouseholds and is not desirable because of the market distortions introduced.\n60. Poverty is not limited to income considerations alone. A clear correlation between non-\nincome measures and poverty exists in the project area.  Poor families have less arable land,\nconsume more than they earn, have smaller and poorer quality housing, and are more likely to\nbe illiterate.  Accordingly, per capita net income acts as an adequate proxy for other quality-of-\nlife measures in the project area.  Based on non-income indicators of poverty, the project area\nhas lower rates than the province average for (i) under-5 child mortality rate (0.78 percent), (ii)\nunderweight rate of under-4 children (6.9 percent), and (iii) households lacking access to water\n(10.3 percent).  While statistically the project area has reasonable access to primary health care\n(94 percent), in reality, there is no clinic in 8.5 percent of the villages. A socioeconomic profile of\nthe project beneficiaries is given in Appendix 2.\n61. Lack of access to water is the most critical welfare concern in drought-prone regions of\nthe PRC.  While the limited availability of water resources has generally constrained the quality\nof life along the Yellow River basin, Yima and Mianchi counties in the project area suffer from\nparticularly acute water shortages adversely affecting about 290,000 people in the urban and\nrural areas, livestock, and small and medium-size industries. During the dry months, local\ngovernments need to arrange at high cost emergency water supply in tanker trucks to support\nthe people and livestock in the affected areas. In these dry periods, local residents pay up to 20\ntimes  as  much  for  water  as  the  cost  of  the  piped  supply.  Industries  are  tapping  deep\ngroundwater at an unsustainable rate and shallow wells are drying up.\n62. The Project will address the major constraints limiting poverty reduction, quality of life,\nand agricultural development in project area: (i) scarcity and poor quality of agricultural land, (ii)\ninadequate access to credit by poor farmers, and (iii) inadequate rural infrastructure (especially\nwater).  The  Project  will  increase  farm  incomes  of  the  less  advantaged  farmers  through\nproductive  and  environmentally  sound  development  of  sloping  and  degraded  land  for\nhorticulture and livestock at household and enterprise levels, and provide credit for the needed\ninvestments. The Project will develop water supply systems to meet the need for rural, urban\nand industrial water in one of the most severely water-scarce areas.\n                  \n36 During processing, commercial banks indicated that they were not keen to act as a financial intermediary due to the\nlack of collateral, market risks, and high transaction costs.", "18\n63. The  success  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program  demonstrates  the\nimportance of carefully targeting assistance to such poor, resource-constrained areas; however,\neven more important is to target poor households within those areas. The horticulture and\nlivestock components will be targeted toward areas where there poverty incidence is high and\nthe people are disadvantaged by resource constraints. The potential direct beneficiaries of\nthese two components are about 140,000 households. In addition, the Project will specifically\ntarget at least 40 percent of beneficiaries below the international poverty line.\n B. Objective and Scope\n64. The primary objective is to promote economic growth and increase farm incomes of poor\nfarmers in West Henan. The Project will include (i) environmentally sustainable development of\nsloping lands for horticulture; (ii) expansion of livestock production using underutilized natural\npastures and crop residues; and (iii) provision of reliable water supplies for rural, urban, and\nindustrial use. The Project will initially cover 22 of 32 counties in West Henan and three other\ndistricts or suburban areas. Nine of the counties are nationally designated poverty counties.\nThe project framework is in Appendix 3. The project components are described below.\n1. Horticulture Development\n65. The  horticulture  component  will  cover  11,267  ha  in  18  counties  and  involve  about\n114,000 farm households. It will support the development and rehabilitation of fruit tree crops\nand traditional medicinal plants, and field and greenhouse vegetables. The tree crops on 8,300\nha include apples, Chinese date, kiwi fruit (Chinese gooseberry), gingko, and eucommia.37  Kiwi\nfruit, gingko and eucommia will be planted from saplings, and apple and date varieties will be\ngrafted onto old varieties. Field vegetables will cover 2,800 ha, and 5,000 greenhouses (on 167\nha) will be established.\n66. The  Project  will  provide  technical  and  financial  support  for  the  development  and\nmaintenance  of  orchards,  including  training  of  extension  workers  and  farmers,  land\ndevelopment, procurement of farm inputs, and development of irrigation systems for some\nselected crops. The topography of the orchards varies from flat and gently undulating land to\nsteep hillsides. Areas with less than a 10-degree slope will be planted on the contour and the\nspace in-between the trees will be planted with ground cover crops. Areas with slopes of 10-25\ndegrees  will  be  terraced,  and  full  technical  services  on  proper  terrace  construction,\nmaintenance, and rehabilitation will be provided at each site.38 No area steeper than 25 degrees\nwill be used for agricultural production and no area of protected arable land will be used for tree\ncrops.\n                  \n37 The bark and leaves of the eucommia tree are used as herbal medicines.\n38Useful experience can be drawn from Loan 1336-PRC: Beijing Environment Improvement, for $157 million,\napproved on 29 November 1994, which dealt with pollution abatement at drinking water reservoirs and carried out\nthe following activities (i) planting trees and contouring hills in the high-elevation area at the first control belt outside\nthe Beijing in the Miyun and Huairou Reservoirs; (ii) planting trees and constructing terraces, check dams, and\nponds at the second control belt; and (iii) planting trees, developing water conservation and ponds, constructing\ndams and drainage canals at the third control belt. About 401 km2 of land was rehabilitated, including 4,784 ha of\nterraces, 21,550 ha of conservation forest, and 11,603 ha of economic forest. Three demonstration comprehensive\nwatershed management and development areas, and two mud and rock debris control and forecasting areas have\nbeen established. About 25,141 check dams, 34 km of drainage canals, and 7.1 km of protective dams have been\ncompleted.", "19\n67. The  Project  will  support  a  program  for  training  project  participants  at  the  village,\ntownship, county, and provincial levels.39 The training and technical support program will take\non several formats generally based on group formation (such as farmer technical associations,\nwhere they exist) for the specific crop to be grown. In the case of crops that will be processed\n(eucommia, gingko and field vegetables), processing companies will give training and technical\nsupport, with support from high-level research institute staff and extension technicians. Key\nfarmers will receive special and extended training, and will transfer this knowledge to other\nfarmers  in  the  locality.  Training  and  technical  support  will  be  channeled  through  the  line\nagencies responsible for each crop. Research institute staff and extension technicians will\nconduct extended and specialized training for selected key farmers and township technicians. At\nleast one member of all participant farmer households will receive basic training. Updated\ntechnical and market information will be available to farmers during project implementation, to\nenable them to make informed choices on crop selection.\n2. Livestock Development\n68. The  livestock  component  is  designed  following  proven  farm  models,40  which  are\ntechnically sound and make optimal use of underutilized pastureland and crop residues in the\nproject area. The component will support cattle breeding and raising in about 9,500 households,\nand sheep and goat breeding and raising in about 14,400 households. In addition, the Project is\nexpected to support the establishment of an integrated 600 head purebred piggery, 3,000 head\nfirst-cross piggery,41 and 2,000 pig-raising households.42 The Project will provide technical,\nfinancial, and marketing support to the participating households, including training of extension\nworkers and farmers. In particular, it will provide for (i) farmer training in livestock management,\nincluding straw and forage treatment and grassland utilization; and (ii) a system for monitoring\nthe  component\u2019s  impact  on  pastures  and  grasslands.  Established  enterprises  with  cross\nshareholding will be involved in the breeding piggeries.\n3. Water Supply and Irrigation Scheme\n69. This component will mitigate serious water shortages in Yima City and Mianchi County\nthrough the construction of facilities for lifting and conveying 83 million m3 of water per year from\nthe Yellow River for rural and urban household consumption,43 industrial and livestock uses, and\nirrigation. The component involves (i) construction of a pumping station on the right bank of the\nYellow River at Huaiba, near Sanmenxia City, which will draw water into settlement basins; (ii)\nconstruction  of  three  pumping  stations  to  lift  the  water  in  stages,  and  a  12.4  km  long\nconveyance system; (iii) construction at Xiduancun of a regulating reservoir with a capacity of\n24.6 million m3, behind an earth-filled 45-meter (m)-high dam (with crest length of 642.5 m), to\nstore part of the water released from the conveyance system for use during periods when water\ncannot be supplied directly from the river because of high sediment content; (iv) construction of\nwater treatment plants and expansion of the water reticulation systems in the Yima and Mianchi\nservice areas; (v) development of an irrigation system to serve 1,300 ha of orchards; and (vi)\n                  \n39 Separate grant funding is sought to support curriculum development and training, demonstration projects, a pilot\ninformation system, and strengthening of extension and NGOs supporting poverty reduction in the project area.\n40 The livestock models are based on the successful experience of the World Bank\u2019s HADP, completed in 1999.\n41 The purebred stock will be partly imported, whereas the first-cross animals (three-way cross offspring of the\npurebreds) will be born in the PRC.\n42 The Government has also studied the importation of purebred boar semen, but problems of semen preservation\nand quarantine restrictions currently render this approach impractical.\n43The inclusion of an associated sewage treatment system for the urban areas will be funded entirely by the\nGovernment.", "20\nresettlement of 1,603 persons in 367 households. The pumps, most of the conveyance system,\nand the reservoir will be constructed for a capacity of 3 m3/second (s), while sections of tunnels\nwill be designed for 7 m3/s to allow for future expansion of the system. The component will\ndirectly benefit about 65,000 households in Yima, Mianchi, and three rural villages; provide\nirrigation water for 1,300 ha in six villages; and supply water for employment-creating industries.\n70. The Yellow River Basin Commission, which regulates the extraction of water from the\nYellow River, has approved the diversion of water at a maximum rate of 7 m3/s.  The water\nauthority  concerned,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  (which  are\nconsistent with ADB policies), prepared a resettlement action plan (RAP), and the relatively\nsmall-scale  resettlement  of  the  affected  families  (367  households)  has  been  substantially\ncompleted without any significant problems to date. Appendix 2 contains a summary RAP.\n C. Cost Estimates\n71. The total cost of the Project is $151.3 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange\ncomponent  of  $66.1  million  equivalent  and  a  local  currency  component  of  $85.2  million\nequivalent (Table 1). The cost estimate includes physical and price contingencies, taxes and\nduties,  front-end  fee,  and  interest  during  construction  (IDC)  on  ADB  and  domestic  loans.\nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n$ million\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n1. Sources\n72. The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $64.3 million from ordinary\ncapital  resources  (OCR).  The  loan  amount  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  the\nProject, with the exception of $1.8 million in foreign exchange costs of the sewage treatment\nplants and minor PMO operating costs that will be entirely funded by the Government. Interest\nwill be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US\ndollar loans. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years,\n0.75 percent progressive commitment charge, and 1.0 percent front-end fee.", "21\n73. The  counterpart  local  currency  requirements  will  be  provided  by  the  provincial,\nmunicipal, county, and township level governments through annual budgets, and by project\nenterprises44 and beneficiaries, who will contribute either in cash or in kind. Loan funds repaid\nprior to the ADB maturity date will be revolved by the county finance bureaus into the agriculture\nsector, with a significant portion earmarked for poverty reduction.45 A summary of the financing\nplan is given in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign   Local Total               Percentage\nExchange Currency\nADB  64.3 \u2013 64.3 42\nLocal Sources    1.8 85.2 87.0    58\nGovernment    1.8 63.5 65.3\nEnterprises - 7.7 7.7\nHouseholds (cash) - 1.7 1.7\nHouseholds (labor) - 4.5 4.5\nLocal Bank - 7.8 7.8\n                  Total 66.1 85.2 151.3 100\n2. Relending and Onlending\n74. The Borrower will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Provincial Finance Bureau\n(PFB), which will onlend to municipal, county, and township finance bureaus at the same rates\nand terms as for the ADB loan. The relevant finance bureau, in turn, will be responsible for\nchanneling the loan proceeds and counterpart funds to the project implementing agencies (IAs),\nenterprises, and farmers. The Finance Bureaus will also be responsible for recovery of the Loan\nproceeds, foreign exchange risks (with the exception of loans to enterprises), and servicing the\ndebt obligations to the Borrower. The onlending interest rates to the endusers (farmers, farmer\ngroups, and enterprises) would be not less than the rate charged by commercial banks for\nsimilar  loans  of  similar  currency  and  terms.  The  repayment  periods  will  be  based  on  the\nprojected cash flow and profitability of each component.\n75. The  county  finance  bureaus,  through  their  township  financial  offices,  will  onlend  to\nfarmers or farmer groups selected by the relevant technical agency (assisted by PADO) at an\ninterest rate not lower than the equivalent commercial bank rate (currently about 7.5 percent),\nwith a grace period based on 1 \u2013 2 years after receiving income from the project investment and\na repayment period of at least four years, based on the projected payback period of each\ncomponent.  Farmer  beneficiaries  will  enter  into  legally  binding  contracts  with  the  relevant\n                  \n44A Construction Bank of China loan for $7.8 million equivalent has been prearranged for the water supply\ncomponent.\n45 Monitoring reports will examine whether this revolving fund mechanism is generating additional support for poor\nfarmers.", "22\ntechnical bureau (on technical implementation arrangements) and the finance bureau (on terms\nand conditions of the loan).46\n76. For the enterprise + household financing, the Provincial or County Finance Bureau will\nonlend the ADB funds in US dollars, at an interest rate not lower than the equivalent commercial\nbank rate, with repayment terms of 10-15 years, depending on projections of profitability, and a\ngrace period of 1-2 years. The enterprises will take the foreign exchange risk and repay the\nloans in US dollar equivalents. For the water supply and irrigation enterprises, the County\nFinance Bureau will onlend the ADB funds on the same terms and conditions as the original\nloan, with the enterprises taking the foreign exchange risk.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Implementation and Coordination\n77. The Project will be implemented over a period of five years commencing in early 2001\nand will be executed by PGH (Appendix 5). PGH has established a Project Leading Group\nwhose members include a vice governor as chairman, the director of the Henan Provincial\nFinance Bureau, the director of the Henan Development Planning Commission, and the heads\nof the provincial line agencies concerned (bureaus of agriculture, forestry, livestock, water\nconservancy,  environment,  statistics,  and  PADO).  The  Project  Leading  Group  will  be\nresponsible for overseeing project implementation, coordinating the various IAs, and resolving\npolicy issues.\n78. PGH has established, under the administrative control of PFB, a Project Management\nOffice (PMO) staffed with trained and qualified technical, financial, and management personnel\nand headed by a director. PMO will (i) compile all feasibility studies pertaining to the project\ncomponents and subcomponents; (ii) draw up annual work programs and budgets; (iii) apply\napproved  selection  criteria47  in  preparing  lists  of  households  and  enterprises  that  may\nparticipate in the horticulture and livestock components; (iv) supervise local and international\nprocurement; (v) supervise Project construction, inspection, and acceptance; (vi) monitor the\nphysical and financial progress of activities; (vii) coordinate and compile progress reporting; and\n(viii)  conduct,  in  coordination  with  the  IAs,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  in\nconjunction with the provincial PADO. The provincial PMO will be assisted by subordinate\nPMOs established in the project municipalities and counties. The provincial PMO will also serve\nas the secretariat for the Project Leading Group.\n79. Under PFB guidance, PMO will (i) review the continued financial viability of the activities\nproposed  under  the  Project  and  recommend  appropriate  actions;  (ii)  approve  the  loan\nagreements with participating households and enterprises, ensuring that priority is given to the\npoorer members of the local communities; (iii) review and approve the annual work program and\nbudget; (iv) ensure that adequate counterpart funding is provided; and (v) coordinate loan\nrepayments  by  the  local  governments  and,  if  necessary,  withhold  annual  budgets  from\ndefaulting local governments.\n80. The IAs for the horticulture and livestock components will be county PMOs with the\nsupport of the local bureaus of Agriculture (BA), Livestock (BL) and Forestry (BF). The pilot\n                  \n46 For simplicity, these two aspects may be combined in one contract, to avoid farmer confusion.\n47Poor townships and villages will be targeted first, with at least 40 percent of poor households targeted as\nbeneficiaries.  Details are in Appendix 2.", "23\nenterprises  for  these  components  have  been  preselected  according  to  the  agreed  upon\nselection criteria. Substitution of pilot enterprises during project implementation must have prior\napproval of ADB. The Sanmenxia Huaiba Water Supply Company (SHWSC) established by the\nSanmenxia Municipal Government, Yima and Mianchi Water Supply Companies, and Mianchi\nIrrigation Company established by the Mianchi Water Conservancy Bureau, will be the IAs for\nthe water supply and irrigation component. A dam safety panel of eminent domestic engineers\nwill be formed to oversee dam construction.  The project organization is shown schematically in\nAppendix 5.\n2. Procurement\n81. Goods and services financed under the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with\nthe ADB Guidelines for Procurement and ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme for procurement.\nEach  supply  contract  for  plant  and  equipment,  vehicles,  and  materials  estimated  to  cost\n$500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each\ncontract estimated to cost $100,000 or more, but less than $500,000, will be awarded through\ninternational shopping. Contracts for less than $100,000 will be by direct purchase (Appendix 6).\nThe civil works contract packages for the water supply and irrigation component will range from\n$0.3 million to $6.0 million. Each contract estimated to cost $2.0 million or more will be awarded\nthrough ICB. Civil works contracts valued at less than $2.0 million will be awarded through local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB), as they are unlikely to be of interest to foreign contractors because\nof the relatively small size of the works, the remote location, and the availability of many capable\nlocal contractors with a competitive advantage to carry out such labor-intensive works. The\nprocedures used for LCB in Henan Province are acceptable to ADB. Some civil works which are\nsimple and labor-intensive and/or where there is no possibility of competition, may be carried\nout through force account (FA), or through contracts awarded to village teams composed mostly\nof eligible farmer beneficiaries (Community Participation in Procurement), where suitable. Prior\nto loan negotiations, PMO engaged (using counterpart funds) a company acceptable to ADB to\nassist the IAs in international procurement.\n3. Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n82. For timely project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action,48 up\nto the stage of signing contracts. ADB also approved, in principle, retroactive financing of $6\nmillion in aggregate, for the following items of expenditure incurred from the date of completion\nof project appraisal by ADB to the date of effectiveness of the ADB loan (i) land preparation and\nexpansion  of  nurseries  for  the  horticulture  component;    (ii)  training  of  extension  staff  and\npotential farmer beneficiaries; and (iii) preparatory civil works for the water supply and irrigation\ncomponent (Appendix 6). Without retroactive financing, delays in project implementation would\nadversely  affect  project  performance.    For  example,  after  several  years  delay  in  project\nprocessing, the Huaiba Water Supply and Irrigation scheme was forced to borrow short term\nbridge financing to commence construction of the pumping station on the Yellow River, when\nimpounded water behind the Xiaolangdi dam threatened to inundate the pump offtake site.\nRetroactive  financing  will  allow  construction  to  continue  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  thus\nobviating the extra costs in demobilizing construction crews and equipment. The Government\nhas been advised that ADB\u2019s concurrence with the advance action and retroactive financing\ndoes not constitute ADB commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or\nthe Project itself.\n                  \n48 This was reported in the May 2000 issue of  ADB Business Opportunities.", "24\n4. Disbursement\n83. Because of numerous small expenditures and FA works involved in implementing the\nhorticulture and livestock components, PFB will establish an imprest account with a local bank\nacceptable to ADB, and ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will apply in disbursement\nof  the  loan  funds.  The  imprest  account  will  cover  procurement  of  such  items  as  planting\nmaterials,  small  tools,  materials  for  livestock  holding  pens,  and  veterinary  supplies.    The\nExternal Debt Management Division of PFB will be authorized to have direct access to the\nimprest account. The accounting systems and procedures of PFB are satisfactory, and their\nfinancial controls and discipline are adequate for the application of the statement of expenditure\nprocedure.\n5. Project Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n84. PMO  will  maintain  records  of  all  expenditures  and  prepare  consolidated  project\naccounts. PFB will ensure that the accounts are audited annually by auditors acceptable to\nADB. The audited reports will be submitted to ADB not later than six months after the end of the\nfiscal year. PMO, in coordination with the other IAs, will submit consolidated quarterly progress\nreports to ADB within one month of the close of the quarter. The quarterly reports will include (i)\nphysical and financial accomplishments, (ii) problems encountered or anticipated and actions\ntaken, and (iii) a work plan for the following quarter. Within six months after project completion,\nPMO will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report summarizing the project\nimplementation,  the  attainment  of  objectives  and  targets,  and  a  critical  evaluation  of  the\nimplementation experience.\n6. Implementation Review\n85. During inception, further details on the poverty targeting mechanisms will be agreed\nupon with the Government. ADB and PGH will jointly undertake a special poverty targeting\nmission after one year of project implementation to ensure that the Project is reaching poor\nfamilies, and a midterm review of the Project in the third year of implementation. Regular review\nmissions will assess implementation progress and examine the appropriateness of the project\ndesign and scope, the effectiveness of poverty targeting arrangements, the criteria for credit\nassistance, and the implementation arrangements. The reviews will recommend any necessary\nmodifications to the design and implementation arrangements to attain the project objectives.\n7. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n86. PGH will establish a BME system in PMO to monitor and assess project impact and\nachievement of the objectives following ADB\u2019s Handbook for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation.\nSample surveys using the rapid rural appraisal method and household interviews will monitor\nfarmer participation in the activities; their access to extension and training services, agricultural\ninputs,  and  other  support  assistance;  and  changes  in  household  incomes  and  off-farm\nemployment. Similar surveys will be carried out to monitor the access of target beneficiaries to\ndependable  water  supplies  for  irrigation  and  for  domestic  and  industrial  consumption,\nconsumers\u2019 ability to pay for water supply, and the impact of the water supply and irrigation\ncomponent on the local economy in the service area. Two such surveys will be conducted\nduring project implementation: one in the third year, prior to the midterm review, and another in\nthe fifth year. The provincial rural and urban survey teams attached to the Statistics Bureau,\nwhich assisted during project preparation, will be engaged to conduct these surveys.  The\nsocioeconomic  data  of  the  potential  beneficiaries  collected  during  project  preparation,", "25\nsupplemented by PADO\u2019s database on poverty incidence, will serve as the baseline for the\nBME. PADO will assist PMO in preparing the annual progress reports, by providing data on\npoverty reduction. After completion, PGH will evaluate the Project impact in accordance with a\nschedule and terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB.\nF. The Executing Agency\n87. The Provincial Government of Henan will be the Executing Agency for this Project.\nPGH, through its PMO, has been the EA for several World Bank-assisted agricultural, rural, and\nwater resources development projects. The organizational and management structures in those\nprojects are similar to those being proposed under the Project, i.e., a leading group and PMOs\nat the provincial, municipal, and county levels, with technical support and services provided by\nthe concerned line agencies at various levels. PGH\u2019s performance in these projects has been\ngenerally satisfactory. Several of the experienced PMO staff will be involved in the proposed\nProject.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n88. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines as part of the feasibility study, and a summary environmental impact assessment\n(SEIA)  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  4  November  1998.49  The  main\nenvironmental concerns relate to the likely impact of the regulating reservoir for the water supply\nand irrigation component. Measures to address these concerns were identified and incorporated\nin the project design. Other concerns raised in the SEIA (and a major reason for a Category A\nrating) related to an agroprocessing component, which was deleted in later processing of the\nProject because of concerns about project quality.\n89. The water supply and irrigation component will include the construction of the Xiduancun\nreservoir, which will have a surface area of 182 ha at full supply level. It will inundate land that\nhas been heavily modified by long human use: thus, impacts on biological resources will be\nnegligible. Although a survey of the inundation area found no historical relics or cultural artifacts,\nprocedures have been established to halt work and preserve artifacts should they be unearthed\nduring construction. Sloping land along the reservoir periphery will be shaped and revegetated\nto minimize landslips. Based on 17 years data, sedimentation will not substantially reduce the\nvolume of active storage for at least 50 years. Downstream impacts are expected to be largely\nbeneficial because the Project will require the relocation of the discharge points from coal\nindustries that have heavily polluted the Jianhe stream passing through the reservoir area. The\ncompensation  release  past  the  dam  will  provide  reliable  potable  water  to  downstream\ncommunities. Spoil from excavation for the water conveyance system and the pump station and\nsettling basins will be deposited on land that is not under productive use, and will not impede\nnatural drainage systems. Spoil sites will be landscaped and revegetated under monitoring\nsupervision  by  the  Henan  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  (EPB).  Adverse  impacts  on\ngroundwater  levels  will  be  negligible.  The  impact  of  pumping  on  the  Yellow  River  will  be\nnegligible because only 1.6-3.8 percent of the average minimum flow will be diverted. The\n                  \n49 An updated version of the SEIA is available on request.  As no environmentally significant components were added\nto the project design and most of the potentially adverse activities covered by the original EIA have been removed\nduring subsequent processing, the revised SEIA was not required to be recirculated.", "26\nProject will establish within SHWSC an environmental protection unit responsible for monitoring\nenvironmental impacts, and supervised by the Henan EPB.\n90. The  Project\u2019s  horticulture  and  livestock  components  are  expected  to  either  have\ncomparatively minor environmental impacts, for which mitigation measures have been included\nin the Project, or actually improve environmental conditions. The horticulture component will be\nundertaken with strict adherence to soil conservation guidelines. Slopes of cultivated land will\nnot exceed 25o, and other soil conservation measures such as erosion interceptors and broad-\nbased terracing will be employed. Any agrochemicals financed under the Project will require\nprior approval from the Institute for the Control of Agrochemicals. The level of support for\nlivestock production in each village will be based on an assessment of grazing land carrying\ncapacity.  Grassland  management  strategies  such  as  rotational  grazing,  which  is  already\npracticed in the area, and introduction of undersown leguminous fodder plants will be supported.\nIntensive production of breeding pigs will require careful attention to treatment of wastes, but,\ngenerally, wastes will be fully utilized for biogas generation and heating during winter.\n2. Resettlement Action Plan\n91. The water supply and irrigation component requires resettlement of approximately 1,603\npersons in 367 households (338 households in the regulating reservoir inundation area and 29\nhouseholds at the pump site on the Yellow River). The magnitude of resettlement is minor by\nPRC standards.  Households in the inundation area will be relocated to four sites around the\nreservoir and, in most cases, will move less than 1 km from their current dwellings. An updated\nRAP, prepared in 1999, and consistent with ADB policy, provides a time-bound agenda for\nrelocation and adequate compensation.50 The main concerns are a decrease in the average per\ncapita agricultural land from the present 2.04 mu to 1.38 mu after relocation, and a possible\nlowering of grain yields on the new land. To avoid a fall in on-farm income, the resettlement plan\nincludes  financial  and  technical  support  for  cultivating  high-value,  irrigated  orchard  and\nvegetable crops on about half of the new agricultural land. Also, the resettled households will be\nexempted from agricultural and special product taxes for 3-5 years. There will be preferential\nhiring of resettled adults, including females, in the construction of the dam and associated\nstructures.  The  living  conditions  of  the  resettled  households  are  expected  to  improve\nimmediately because the housing conditions and amenities such as schools, water supply, and\nelectricity at the resettlement sites are superior to those at the present sites. On-farm incomes\nare expected to reach or exceed current levels after three years. Support will be provided to\nmaintain living standards during this interim period.  For example, resettled households will be\n(i) given preference for off-farm industrial employment in the project area; (ii) given preferential\naccess to agricultural assistance, the poverty aid fund, and social development funds; (iii)\nexempted from various levies and taxes; and (iv) exempted from the mineral resource levy for\nbuilding materials and roof tiles.\n92. Among the households to be resettled, 29 households at the pump site have already\nbeen relocated, 19 to a site about 500 m from their original dwellings, and 10 to Mianchi, 23 km\naway,  to  join  relatives  living  there.  To  date,  about  125  families,  mainly  from  the  dam\nconstruction area, have been relocated, although some of the public infrastructure in the new\nvillages is still under construction. About 242 families remain to be resettled, mainly from the\ntailwater of the regulating reservoir. A survey of the resettlement sites and interviews with\npeople already resettled indicate that conditions at the resettlement sites are a significant\nimprovement over their previous residences. Those interviewed expressed their satisfaction with\n                  \n50 The RAP was made available to all affected persons and is available for review on request.", "27\narrangements thus far, and indicated that the local resettlement bureau had made regular and\nfrequent visits to monitor conditions in the resettlement areas.  Many of those compensated to\ndate have invested in construction equipment (such as trucks), which they anticipate will be\nneeded once full-scale construction starts, or pooled their compensation funds to invest in off-\nfarm activities.\n3. Public Consultation\n93. Since the Project was first proposed for ADB funding in 1993, there has been extensive\nconsultation with all stakeholders.  During project planning, public meetings, group interviews in\nthe field, questionnaires, key informant interviews, and public display of project documents were\nused to solicit public input and feedback. Representatives of the National People\u2019s Congress\nand  People\u2019s  Consultative  Committee  in  the  municipalities  and  counties  were  interviewed,\nsenior officials at all levels of government were consulted, and NGOs (such as the Women\u2019s\nFederation, Brilliant Cause, and Foundation for Poverty Reduction) offered advice on how to\neffectively tackle poverty reduction in the area.  Consultation will continue throughout project\nimplementation  through  newsletters,  technical  group  formation,  development  of  a  market\ninformation system, and follow-up surveys and progress reports.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Production and Markets\n94. The horticulture component promotes five fruit and medicinal tree crops, and vegetables,\ncarefully selected after extensive technical and marketing studies. At full production, 5,800 ha of\nfruit trees will produce about 72,600 t of fresh fruit per year (apples, kiwi fruit, and Chinese\ndates). Annual medicinal plant production on 2,500 ha will be about 2,640 t (gingko leaves and\nnuts, eucommia leaves and bark), field vegetable production on 2,800 ha will be 176,000 t, and\n5,000 sets of greenhouses will produce 21,900 t of vegetables. This component is part of an\nongoing development of tree crops and vegetables by farmers in the project area, and will\naccelerate the rate of planting and reworking trees with improved varieties. Without the Project,\nit is assumed the same areas would be planted over 10 years instead of 4.\n95. The demand for fresh fruit and traditional medicines in the PRC has increased rapidly\nsince 1990. The rising demand has been met by a rapid increase in production. Fruit production\nand vegetable production have increased 4.9 and 3.4 times, respectively, since 1990. There is a\ndanger  of  overproduction  in  some  crops,  and  falling  prices  unless  quality  products  are\nproduced. Therefore, the Project has been cautious to promote only selected crops for which\nextensive market analysis has been conducted.  Moreover, a flexible strategy will be followed,\nso that farmers can minimize their risk through diversification or choosing activities adapted to\nchanging market conditions. Market information and projections will be provided to all farmers\nthrough the network of PMOs established throughout the project area.\n96. The household cattle raising activity will produce 15,580 18-month-old cattle and about\n2,375 aged cows per year at full production. The sheep raising activity will produce 108,000\nsurplus animals per year, with live weight of 5,400 t, and 14,400 aged sheep for slaughter with\nlive weight of 936 t. Raising goats for meat will produce a total of 108,000 surplus animals per\nyear with a total live weight of 6,075 t and 14,400 aged goats with live weight of 720 t. The\nbreeding piggeries will produce 4,600 purebred sows, 20,000 crossbred sows, 25,000 piglets,", "28\n11,200 porkers, and 1,240 culled sows each year. The Project will assist 2,000 households to\npurchase crossbred animals for raising porkers. These households will produce about 68,000\nanimals annually. The pigs will be sold in the local markets for lean pork production. Total\nannual meat production will be absorbed in the local market, which is expanding rapidly.\n97. The water supply component addresses the needs of an area where water is shortage\nand unreliable supply result in the poor quality of rural and urban life and constrain agricultural\nand industrial development. An adequate water supply is necessary to support the growth in the\narea\u2019s population, which is projected to rise from 290,000 in 2000 to 586,000 by 2022. Of this\nnumber, 84,000 will be migrant workers attracted by industrial development dependent on\nprovision of water. Initially 11 percent of the water will be used for rural domestic, irrigation, and\nlivestock uses, but that will rise to 17 percent in 2022 due primarily to an increase in the\nlivestock population by 330,000 when water constraints are removed. If water were available,\n8,000 ha in the area is potentially suitable for future orchard development. Urban and domestic\nusers initially will consume 13 percent of the supplied water, increasing to 27 percent in 2022 as\nthe population increases. Priority will be given to satisfying all nonindustrial water demands\nbefore any industrial demands are met. On the basis of existing industries, industry under\ndevelopment, and additional planned industry, industrial demand will exceed water supply by 25\nmillion m\u00b3 in 2022. That excess demand, plus the demand from new industries, will be met by a\nsecond-phase development for which part of the conveyance capacity is provided in the project\ncosts, but no benefits are included in the analysis. The water supplied will be readily marketable\nand will contribute to substantial improvements in the quality of life and economic development.\n2. Financial and Economic Rates of Return\n98. Financial and economic analyses were carried out for the Project as a whole and for\neach of the three components. Assumptions underlying the analyses are given in Appendix 7\nand the results of the analysis, including sensitivity tests, are summarized in Table 3. The\nProject is financially and economically viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 14\npercent and an EIRR of about 17 percent. The Project is relatively robust under sensitivity\nanalysis, but with some differences among the components.\n99. The FIRR and EIRR for the horticulture component overall are 16.7 percent and 18.1\npercent, respectively. The subcomponent FIRRs range from 14.4 percent for field vegetables to\n20.3 percent for greenhouses (assuming half of the greenhouses are of the simple type and half\nare the standard model). As the component accelerates the assumed without-Project pace of\ndevelopment, it is sensitive to delay, but not excessively so. One year\u2019s delay in benefits\nreduces the net present value (NPV) by about 30 percent, lowering the FIRR to 12 percent, but\nstill well above the financial cost of capital (FCOC), which is estimated to be about 8 percent. No\nsubcomponent  is  excessively  sensitive  to  changes  in  investment  or  operating  costs,  but\nChinese dates and field vegetables are sensitive to price variations.\n100. For the household livestock activities as a whole, the FIRR is estimated at 18.4 percent\nand the EIRR at 19.9 percent, with the FIRRs ranging from about 17.1 percent for cattle\nbreeding to about 21 percent for sheep.\n101. The  financial  returns  to  the  proposed  livestock  enterprises  (purebred  piggery  and\ncrossbred piggery) are about 13 percent for purebred pigs and 22 percent for crossbred pig\nbreeding. The corresponding EIRRs for these activities are estimated at 15 and 25 percent,\nrespectively. In aggregate, the estimated base FIRR for the piggery enterprise investments is\nabout 19 percent. The aggregate base EIRR is estimated at just under 22 percent.", "29\n102. The rates of return show some sensitivity to adverse changes in investment costs or\ndelays in implementation, but substantial sensitivity to changes in prices and operating costs,\nparticularly among the FIRRs of the individual proposals. Maintaining efficiency in operations is\na primary consideration for success of the investments, but equally important for all enterprises\nis securing high volumes of sales that reward consistently high product quality.\n103. Purebred pig breeding, with an FIRR of about 13 percent, should provide a satisfactory\nfinancial  return,  provided  that  consistently  efficient  management  and  quality  control  are\nimplemented. Its viability, however, is sensitive to changes in revenues and operating costs.\nFor example, a decrease in sales revenue by 10 percent reduces the return to about 3 percent.\nPerformance is less sensitive to increases in operating costs (operating costs are estimated at\nabout  78  percent  of  the  total  value  of  sales  at  full  development).  The  returns  to  the\ncrossbreeding piggery investment are more robust than for the purebred breeding unit. A 10\npercent reduction in revenues would reduce the base FIRR to about 15 percent and the EIRR\nwould decline from 25 to about 16 percent.  As there is substantial cross shareholding in both\ncompanies, the overall risk is minimized.\n104. For the overall water supply component, the FIRR is estimated at 11.7 percent and the\nEIRR at 16 percent. The overall figures include the performance of the consolidated water\nsupply and distribution companies and the performance of the 1,300 ha of orchards to be\ndeveloped in Mianchi\u2019s North Irrigation Area. Separately, the FIRRs for the water companies\nand irrigated orchard development range between 8 and 14 percent, but cluster around 12\npercent.  The EIRRs are similarly clustered around 16 percent.  The consolidated EIRR for the\nwater and irrigation companies is estimated at 16 percent while the economic return to irrigated\norchard development alone is calculated to be about 15 percent.  Individually, the EIRR is\nestimated at 16 percent for Sanmenxia, about 22 percent for the Mianchi Water Distribution\nCompany, 17 percent for the Mianchi Irrigation Company, and 17 percent for the Yima Water\nDistribution Company.   The component FIRRs are sensitive to changes in operating costs, but\nlocal authorities can and have adjusted water tariffs to compensate for anticipated increased\ncosts.   The sensitivity analysis can be misleading, as increased operating costs of the water\ndistribution companies will trigger an increase in revenues for the bulk water company and, at\nthe same time, prompt a process to adjust water tariffs.\n105.  The base case EIRRs for the water companies should be regarded as lower bounds.\nWithout the Project, the incremental supply of water for the area in the future would be much\nless than with the Project, and the cost of supply would be much higher.   Many urban users\ncurrently pay 5-10 times the price of water that has been applied in the analysis. The true\neconomic return to the component is therefore likely to be much higher than what is presented\nhere.  On the basis of these lower bound estimates for the economic value of water supply\nbenefits,  the  overall  economic  return  to  water  supply,  distribution,  and  irrigation  company\ninvestments should remain satisfactory even with a 10 percent decrease in revenues.  Likewise,\na 10 percent increase in operating costs will not have a devastating impact.  Changes in total\ninvestment costs do not strongly affect returns.   These sensitivity results, based on substantial\nunderestimation of the value of water, suggest that the economic viability of the water supply\nscheme may be assured.\n106.  Table 3 summarizes the returns and sensitivity analysis of the separate components.\nSwitching values (SV, or the percentage change in the base value of a variable that would\nequate to the internal rate of return to a chosen discount rate) are calculated using 8 percent as", "30\nthe FCOC (for the financial sensitivity analysis) and 12 percent as the opportunity cost of capital\n(OCC) (for the economic sensitivity analysis).\nTable 3 : Results of Financial, Economic and Sensitivity Analyses\n(percent)\nHorticulture Household Livestock Water Supply Total Project\nLivestock Enterprises\nFinancial Analysis\nBase Case\n        IRR 16.7 18.4 18.6 11.7 13.9\nOutput Prices \u201310 %\n        IRR 12.0 9.4 9.0 9.7 10.2\n        SV -18.7 -11.6 -10.9 -18.0 -15.9\nOperating Costs +10%\n        IRR 14.4 11.1 11.2 7.8 9.8\n        SV 40.4 14.4 13.7 9.3 13.1\nInvestment Costs +10%\n        IRR 15.7 17.0 17.1 10.7 12.7\n        SV 162.1 150.7 116.6 43.2 39.2\nBenefits Delay 1 Year\n        IRR 12.4 10.2 9.3 10.6 10.9\nEconomic Analysis\nBase Case\n        IRR 18.1 19.9 21.8 16.0 17.3\nOutput Prices \u201310 %\n        IRR 11.0 9.6 13.5 12.2 11.9\n        SV -8.7 -7.6 -15.9 -10.5 -9.9\nOperating Costs +10%\n        IRR 15.5 11.5 15.6 11.0 12.5\n        SV 24.2 9.4 15.5 8.0 10.9\nInvestment Costs +10%\n        IRR 17.1 18.3 20.1 14.8 16.0\n        SV 84.6 72.6 91.4 38.3 31.7\nBenefits Delay 1 Year\n        IRR 13.8 10.4 12.1 14.3 13.5\nIRR = internal rate of return, SV = switching value.\n107. The financial and economic analyses of the water supply and irrigation component do\nnot include the potential benefits of the second phase development, although some of the\ninfrastructure costs are incurred for the second phase. The second phase water supply will\nincrease capacity utilization and the internal rates of return, especially for SHWSC and the Yima\nWater Distribution Company.\n 3. Subsidies, Taxes, and Cost Recovery\n108. Subsidies  associated  with  the  Project  consist  of  agricultural  extension  and  training\nservices provided without cost recovery for the horticulture and livestock components. However,\nthe Project will generate additional tax revenues for the Government, including (i) value-added\ntaxes and import duties on the development costs; (ii) sales taxes in the form of agricultural\nproduction  tax,  value-added  tax,  development  tax,  and  education  tax  on  component  sales\nrevenues; and (iii) corporate income tax on all commercial enterprises in each component. The\nwater  supply  and  irrigation  component  will  ensure  cost  recovery  through  approved  tariff\nadjustments, which are based on full cost recovery.  Where possible, project loans to end-users\nwill  be  matched  by  physical  collateral,  detailed  in  legally  binding  contracts,  thus  providing\nincentives for on-time loan repayment.  The total cost of the Project, including subsidies, will be\nrecovered through these taxes, tariffs, and repayment of loans by each component.", "31\n4. Risks\n109. The project design takes into account potential institutional, marketing, and technical\nrisks. As formulated, the Project is not expected to face any unusual institutional risks. PMO has\nexperience  in  project  implementation  based  on  its  good  performance  in  implementing  the\nrecently completed World Bank-funded HADP. The municipal and county governments have\nexperience in implementing similar developments, and were integrally involved in project design\nduring the preparation stage.  Counties with excessive debts or unsure about their ability to\nprovide counterpart funds were permitted to withdraw from the Project, thus ensuring strong\ncommitment on the part of local governments.51\n110. Each component will produce a wide range of products, primarily for the domestic\nmarket, for which marketing arrangements exist and in which incremental project production will\nbe a relatively small addition to total production in the PRC.  Extensive market assessment has\nbeen undertaken to ensure that the risk of inadequate market demand is minimal.  In addition,\nPGH  will  assess  the  extent  to  which  other  provinces  in  the  PRC  are  undertaking  similar\nproduction increases and make appropriate changes to areas planted and livestock numbers,\nduring project implementation.  Farmers will be provided with up-to-date market information to\ninform  their  choice  of  horticulture  or  livestock  options  and  will  be  encouraged  to  diversify\nproduction rather than concentrate all their investments on one activity.\n111. The issue of risk has been addressed in each of the horticulture subcomponents so as to\nreduce the risk imposed by reduced market demand due to oversupply and inadequate produce\nquality:\n(i)  The Project will not require farmers to follow precisely the production models of\nthe selected tree crops outlined for the project analysis. Rather farmers will be\nallowed to select diverse tree crops based on their own informed assessment,\nplus market information from the Project and other sources.\n(ii)  All project farmers will receive training and technical support to ensure a quality\nof produce that can compete successfully in the market.\n(iii)  Apple trees will be grafted with early-maturing varieties that will produce apples\nbefore the market is oversupplied and while prices are still high.\n(iv)  Kiwi fruit will be produced in a warmer location in which the fruit will mature\nearlier than those of competitors in neighboring provinces and therefore can be\nsold easily in the Zhengzhou market. Moreover, a controlled atmosphere storage\nchamber for kiwi fruit (3,000 t) is under construction in Zhengzhou.\n(v)  Gingko leaf production will be coordinated with the Lushan Mingkang Gingko\nProcessing  Company  that  exports  gingko  extract  throughout  the  PRC  and\noverseas. The gingko production model considers compensatory production of\nnuts and leaves.\n(vi)  Other products such as Chinese dates and vegetables are not anticipated to\nmeet marketing difficulties, provided product quality is maintained.\n112. In the livestock component, risk has been mitigated by recommending that pregnant\nanimals be procured by the Project, to ensure quick returns to farmers.  Highly fecund and\nproductive breeds of livestock have been selected to ensure that offspring will command a\nmarket premium.  Pig breeding based on improved imported breeds will substantially increase\n                  \n51 To date, 3 of the 12 national poverty counties have declined to be involved due to previous foreign assistance, high\nlevels of debt, or lack of counterpart funds.", "32\nthe quality of porkers, with lean pigs increasingly commanding a price premium on both local\nand export markets.  The risk of animal diseases, and hence loss to farmers, will be minimized\nwith the provision of veterinary services by the pilot enterprise or livestock bureau.  Farmers will\nbe encouraged to diversify livestock production to mitigate the risks of adverse price changes.\nFarmers can also revert to locally available nonpurchased feed if input prices rise, and retain\ntheir animals longer to reach desirable sales weights.\n113. PMO and the relevant government agencies will need to be sufficiently sensitive to the\ndifficult  task  of  effectively  targeting  poor  households.  Risks  will  be  minimized  by  effective\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements  during  implementation,  especially  by  relatively\nindependent observers, such as PADO and other poverty-related agencies, and by continuing\npolicy dialogue between ADB and PGH. Poor households will be permitted to enter the Project\nat a level of debt with which they feel comfortable, and the Project will enable poor households\nthat  repay  loans  on  time  to  take  out  repeat  loans  to  expand  their  production.  All  poor\nhouseholds will be given time to decide on whether to participate or not, will be provided with\nadequate training and encouraged to join support groups, and will be given the chance to review\nthe  experience  of  other  households  within  the  same  village  or  county.  Poor  farmers  are\nexpected to establish a satisfactory credit history as well as build up collateral during the\nProject, which will enable them to access commercial rural credit for future expansion. Early\nrepayment of loans will enable local governments to establish a revolving fund, part of which\nmay be earmarked for additional poverty assistance.\nB. Social Dimensions\n114. An  estimated  204,900  households  (0.9  million  people)  will  benefit  directly  from  the\nproject interventions: 114,000 households in horticulture, 25,900 in household livestock, and at\nleast  65,000  rural  and  urban  households  through  domestic,  livestock,  and  irrigation  water\nsupply. In total, about 340,000 poor people are expected to benefit from the Project and will\nraise their annual income above the international poverty line.\n115. Several  hundred  households  will  benefit  from  the  creation  of  permanent  nonfarm\nemployment opportunities. The intensive piggery breeding units will create 290 jobs with annual\nremuneration of Y1.7 million. Water supply will directly create about 500 jobs, with annual\nremuneration  of  Y2.94  million,  and  many  nonfarm  jobs  will  be  created  indirectly  through\nindustrial and commercial development dependent on the water supply component.\n116. Most employment, and highest returns to labor, will be in the horticulture and household\nlivestock  components.  At  full  development,  the  horticulture  component  will  create  30,070\nperson-years equivalent of annual employment with a total remuneration for labor and net farm\nincome of Y271 million, or an average of Y36 per labor-day,52 reflecting the moderate labor\ninput  and  high  returns  from  established  orchards.  The  household  cattle,  goat,  and  sheep\nactivities  will  create  4,150  person-years  of  work  at  a  total  remuneration  of  Y51.4  million,\naveraging Y39 per labor-day. Women will actively participate in the household-based activities,\nespecially those related to horticulture and livestock.\n117. At  full  development,  household  incomes  will  increase  significantly.  Before  imputing\nhousehold labor costs, incremental household income in horticulture53 will range from around\n                  \n52 The return per labor-day averages Y16 from existing grain production and Y20 from existing apple orchards.\n53 Incremental household incomes are based on average landholdings of 0.3 ha.  Some poor households have even\nless land and incremental incomes would be smaller, in proportion to landholding.", "33\nY500 for gingko, Y1,219 for field vegetables, and Y1,340 for Chinese dates, to Y2,100 for apple\ndevelopment, Y5,370 for kiwi fruit, and Y7,460 on average for greenhouse development. In\nlivestock activities, incremental household income will range from Y1,650 for sheep and meat\ngoat  raising,  Y2,330  for  breeding  porkers,  and  to  Y2,420  for  cattle  raising.  The  average\nincremental household income in horticulture will be about Y1,631, an increase of about 36\npercent in the household incomes of 60 percent of the beneficiaries near the poverty line, and\nabout  12  percent  on  average  for  other  participating  households.  The  average  incremental\nhousehold income from livestock is estimated at Y1,983 to give poor households an increase in\nincomes of about 44 percent, and less poor households an increase of about 14 percent.  About\n60 percent of the beneficiary livestock households are classified as absolute poor. Before\nimputing household labor costs, total net incremental farm household income attributable to the\nProject is estimated at Y251 million per year: Y200 million from horticulture and Y51 million from\nlivestock.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\n118. The Government and the Provincial Government of Henan have given the following\nassurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal\ndocuments.\n(i)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, PGH will establish a suitably staffed\nBME unit within PMO and will appoint a dam safety panel of eminent national\nengineers to oversee dam construction at Huaiba.  PMO will conduct routine\nmonitoring surveys during implementation (including progress of the RAP), and\nreport the results of such surveys to ADB in a timely manner.\n(ii)  In  selecting  farmer  participants,  the  assistance  of  PADO  and  other  poverty\nagencies will be sought to give priority to the absolute and relative poor members\nof  the  local  communities.  For  the  horticulture  development  component,  the\namount of land to be allocated to any household will not exceed 5 mu (0.33 ha)\nfor any crop, PMO will issue guidelines on model contracts, and the land use\nright contract will include a tenure of up to 50 years for barren upland areas. PGH\nwill select at least 40 percent of intended project beneficiaries with incomes\nbelow Y1,000 per year.\n(iii)  Prior to the construction of the Huaiba pumping station and the Xiduancun dam\nand reservoir under the water supply and irrigation component, the affected\nfamilies will be resettled in other areas and so compensated that they will not\nsuffer  a  reduction  in  income,  deterioration  in  their  living  conditions,  or\nunnecessary  social  dislocation.    Households  relocated  before  project\neffectiveness  will  be  given  priority,  thus  ensuring  that  they  are  adequately\ncompensated and their livelihood restored, before the remaining households are\nrelocated.  Land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out in accordance\nwith the agreed upon RAP.  The RAP will be publicly available for review, and\nany concerns or grievances will be adequately addressed.\n(iv)  The  national,  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments  and  their\ncorporations, in aggregate, will not own more than 49 percent of the shares of\nany pilot enterprise to be supported under the Project.", "34\n(v)  The water tariffs under the water supply component will be set at levels adequate\nto recover the full investment and O&M costs and obtain a reasonable return on\ninvestments under the Project by the water utilities companies.\n(vi)  All  activities  to  be  supported  under  the  Project  will  meet  the  national\nenvironmental  standards  and  EIA  procedures  which  are  based  on  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources\nDevelopment Projects and for Selected Infrastructure Projects and no Category\nA or B subproject will be approved for financing without a comprehensive EIA\nreport reviewed and approved by the Henan EPB.\n(vii)  Each industrial unit to be served by the water supply component will be required\nto submit to the IA a certificate from the appropriate environmental authorities of\nthe  Government  stating  that  the  unit  fully  meets  the  national  standards  for\nindustrial emission, wastewater treatment, and solid waste disposal.\n(viii)  Tree crop production will not be permitted on protected arable land, as defined by\nthe Land Administration Law, or on slopes greater than 25 degrees.\n(ix)  PFB will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loan to municipal and county\nfinance bureaus at the same rates and terms as the ADB Loan.  PGH will ensure\nthat adequate counterpart funds are made available in a timely manner. With the\nexception of onlending to enterprises and water supply and irrigation companies,\nthe  municipal  and  county  finance  bureaus,  where  appropriate,  will  bear  the\nforeign exchange risk.\n(x)  With the exception of onlending to water supply and irrigation companies, the\nrespective  finance  bureaus  will  onlend  funds  to  end  users  at  terms  and\nconditions satisfactory to ADB and at a rate of interest not lower than the rates of\ninterest for equivalent lending by commercial banks.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n119. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $64,300,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital  resources  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  West  Henan  Agricultural\nDevelopment Project, with a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years and with\ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for\nUS dollar loans and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\n  TADAO CHINO\n President\n27 November 2000", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page  Cited on\n (page, para.)\n1 External Assistance to the Agriculture Sector in --,29\nHenan Province\n2 Poverty and Social Dimensions Analysis, and  --,63\nSummary Resettlement  Action Plan\n3 Project Framework --,67\n4 Detailed Cost Estimates --,74\n5 Implementation Arrangements,  --,80\nOrganization Chart, and Implementation Schedule\n6 Contract Packages  --,84\n7 Financial and Economic Analyses --,100\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Detailed Description of Project Components\nB Summary Environmental Impact Assessment\nC Resettlement Plan\nD Marketing Assessment\nE Pilot Enterprise Analysis\nF Project Costs\nG Supporting Tables for Financial and Economic Analyses\nH Poverty Assessment", "36\nAppendix 1, page 1\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN HENAN PROVINCE\n1. The World Bank has been the main source of external assistance to the agriculture and\nrural development sector in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). All previous World  Bank\nlending to agriculture and rural development used concessional funds under the International\nDevelopment Association (IDA).\n2. The  World  Bank  has  successfully  supported  provincial  multicomponent  area\ndevelopment projects prepared and implemented by the local governments. Eleven World Bank\nprojects covered Henan Province with a total investment of $250.8 million. Four of them focused\non forestry, two on livestock, two on irrigation, two on seed commercialization, and one on\nagricultural  development.  The  latter  project  is  the  Henan  Agriculture  Development  Project\n(HADP) which, between May 1991 and June 1998, provided $110 million in foreign exchange.\nHADP is very similar to the proposed Project. It covers 20 counties in the northern and eastern\npart of Henan (along the Yellow River). HADP comprised an agroprocessing component for 11\nplants, horticulture, livestock and some pig farms. After evaluating progress, the World Bank\npresented HADP to the other provinces as a model project. In contrast to critical ratings by the\nMinistry of Finance (MOF) of agroprocessing projects in other parts of the PRC (36 percent\nsuccess rate), the agroprocessing component in Henan Province ($38 million investment) was\nfound to be 80 percent successful, although there are ongoing difficulties in relation to operating\nfunds.\n3. In Henan, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) completed two fruit processing\nprojects with a total investment of $15.1 million, and the World Food Programme (WFP) funded\na farmland rehabilitation project, with investments of $16.6 million.\n4. A participatory poverty reduction project in Tongbai County was supported by the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).  The project started in 1997 and covered six townships with\na total investment of Y2.14 million. The project integrated social development, capacity building,\nand  empowerment  of  women,  with  income-generation  activities.  It  used  a  participatory\nmethodology to select and implement project activities, and community development through\ngroup formation and training was a priority activity.\n5. Bilateral  projects  in  Henan  have  been  relatively  few.  The  Japan  International\nCooperation Agency (JICA) supported a project for the rehabilitation of rice fields ($3 million). A\nfruit  processing  project  in  the  province  was  financed  by  a  Japanese  nongovernment\norganization (NGO).  Previously, the United Kingdom (UK) had a $7.1 million duck raising\nproject in the province.  The Netherlands is currently supporting a dairy cow project.\n6.       The Henan Water and Irrigation Project of the German Agency for Technical Cooperation\n(GTZ) was started in early 1998.  The project covers 57 communities of eight townships in four\nof  the  project  counties:  Songxian  and  Yichuan  in  Luoyang  City,  Neixiang  and  Xichuan  in\nNanyang City.  The GTZ project was designed to improve the conditions of water supply and\nirrigation in the project area.  Total project investment was Y12.46 million, of which Y5.85 million\nwas from GTZ, Y4.52 million from the local counterpart fund, and Y2.09 million was the value of\nlocal labor.  The water supply works were expected to help 7,800 people in the project area to\naccess safe drinking water.  The water conservation component, including construction of\nterraces and dams, and planting of tree crops, will cover 719 ha and 930 households.", "37\nAppendix 1, page 2\n7. Between 1987 and 1998, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financed 10 loans (for\n8 projects) in the agriculture sector in the PRC with a total investment of $779.6 million, and 53\ntechnical assistance (TA) grants amounting to $31 million. This Project will be ADB\u2019s first in\nHenan.  In  the  past,  the  Government\u2019s  foremost  concern  in  selecting  projects  for  external\nassistance  was  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  to  repay  the  loan.  In  view  of  this\nconsideration, ADB\u2019s program in agriculture needed to focus on revenue-generating production\nand agroprocessing projects to justify the Government\u2019s use of funds from the ordinary capital\nresources (OCR). As a result, ADB financing for agriculture focused on agricultural production\nand production credit. In the mid-1990s, increased environmental concerns were integrated into\nthe project designs. With economic reforms and more emphasis placed on poverty reduction,\nADB now has new opportunities to diversify its operations in the sector and specifically address\npoverty.\n8.

Introduction\n1. The Project specifically targets poverty intervention by addressing critical agricultural\nand water supply constraints in a poor inland province.  Because the water supply and irrigation\ncomponent necessitates some resettlement from the pump site and regulating reservoir, a\nresettlement action plan was prepared.\nB. Socioeconomic Profile of Potential Beneficiaries\n2. Demographic features. Agricultural communities in West Henan constitute about 83\npercent of the total population, rising to 95 percent in Yichuan and Songxian. Twelve of the 32\ncounties in the project area are nationally designated poverty counties.1 While 98.4 percent of\nthe population is ethnically Han, there are 18 different ethnic minority groups in the project area.\nMost counties have one or more ethnic minorities, on average 12 minority groups each. Almost\n80 percent of the total minority population is accounted for by the three largest minorities:\nMuslim Hui, 61 percent of all minorities and 1 percent of total population, are concentrated in\nZhengping, Dengfeng, Yuzhou, and Xinmi counties; Manchus, 11 percent of minorities, are\nconcentrated in Nanzhao County; and Mongols, 7 percent of minorities, are concentrated in\nNeixiang  County.  The  average  household  size  is  4.20,  slightly  smaller  than  the  province\naverage of 4.59. Average household sizes in counties range from 3.3 in Luoyang to 5.0 in\nYichuan.  The average family size in Henan Province is 3.86, suggesting that, on average, most\nfamilies have one additional household occupant (often a grandparent).\n3. Settlement pattern and production systems. Population density in West Henan is 463\nhouseholds per square kilometer (km\u00b2), or 1,945 people per km\u00b2. Households range from 91 per\nkm\u00b2 in Songxian to 1,101 per km\u00b2 in Yima.  On average, 41 percent of the population live in\nmountainous areas with over 90 percent in Xichuan, Lushi, Songxian, Nanzhao and Luanchuan.\nMore than half of the slopes in the mountainous areas are over 25 degrees and, thus, crop\ncultivation on them is officially prohibited.\n4. Due to the uneven distribution of good and poor land under agricultural reform, most\nfarms comprise several plots of varying quality, resulting in diversified farming systems rather\nthan monoculture. In the project area, almost half of the arable land is wholly or partially\nirrigated.\n5. Many villages in the hilly areas are difficult to access by road and lack electricity. In\naddition, 14.8 percent of the households in the project area lack adequate drinking water.2  The\naverage household size in 332 sample families in the project area was 5.47,3 compared with the\naverage of 4.2 in West Henan.\n                                                          \n1 They are Yiyuang, Xin\u2019an, Ruyang, Luoning, Yichuan, Songxian, Luanchuan, Lushan, Mianchi, Lushi, Nanzhao,\nand Xichuan.\n2  With the exception of Mengxia, all counties and 27 percent of the townships (i.e., 13,484 villages) in the project\narea experience potable water shortages. The situation is most severe in Shanxian (24 percent of households) and\nLuanchuan (14 percent).\n3  Minority families are exempted from strict family planning targets.", "39\nAppendix 2, page 2\n6. Labor availability and gender issues. The labor force in West Henan is about 8 million\npeople, or 45.5 percent of the population. Total employment in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) increased by 9.46 percent from 1990 to 1998.  At the same time, employment in Henan\nincreased by 22.4 percent.  Most new employment in Henan over 1990-1998 was absorbed in\nthe rural areas, although not necessarily in agriculture.\n7. The ratio of the male-to-female working population is 52:48. On-farm tasks are typically\nundertaken equally by men and women with few exceptions, such as men undertaking tree\nfelling  and  women  traditionally  raising  pigs.  Survey  data  suggest  that  households  relying\nprimarily on their own labor are income maximizers, placing priority on increased economic\nactivity over increased leisure. This work ethic contributes to effective labor availability.\n8. There is a slight male bias in the total workforce, but the gender-biased seasonal\nmigration of male labor to off-farm activities results in a developing female bias in farm labor.\nWomen  rarely  undertake  off-farm  employment,  using  slack  time  for  cottage  industry  and\nhousehold  tasks,  but  men  increasingly  take  advantage  of  greater  off-farm  employment\nopportunities. Tree crops, requiring little labor input compared with arable crops except in\nharvesting, will increase the amount of slack time for both men and women. The result will be\nincreased  seasonal  migration  of  male  labor  and  increased  farm-based  activities,  such  as\ncottage industry, vegetable growing, and small livestock raising by women.\n9. Current income status. The latest detailed income survey of the project area was\nundertaken in 19954 (Table A2.1).  In 1995, about 36 percent of the horticulture households had\nincomes  in  the  band  immediately  above  the  poverty  threshold,  corresponding  to  the\ninternational poverty standard. In total, almost 70 percent of the target horticulture households\nwere below or only marginally above the international poverty standard.5 Around 61 percent of\ntarget livestock households were below or only marginally above the international poverty line.6\n10. The per capita net income of rural dwellers in the PRC increased 46.8 percent from\n1990 to 1998.  The growth rates of farmers' income in the project area and Henan Province\nwere 119 percent and 72.4 percent, respectively, during the same period.  The disposable\nincome of residents in urban areas in the PRC and Henan increased 66.5 percent and 61.1\npercent,  respectively,  from  1990  to  1998.  Despite  this  growth,  the  majority  of  the  project\nbeneficiaries have annual incomes below the average rural incomes in the PRC and below the\nHenan annual average rural income of Y1,864.7\n                                                          \n4 Although there have been changes in project design since 1995, the target group of beneficiaries has remained the\nsame.\n5  In 1995 prices, the officially determined poverty threshold income for Henan was Y530 per capita (currently Y700).\nIn target groups for horticulture development, 32.7 percent of households had incomes below Y530, including 17\npercent with incomes below Y400 per capita.\n6 The proportion of households below the official poverty level in 1995 was 23.1 percent. About 38 percent of\nlivestock households were in the marginal group above the poverty level.\n7 One third of beneficiaries were estimated to be below the official absolute poverty level in Henan Province of Y700\nper annum (compared with 29.9 percent in 1995).  This suggests that the distribution of poverty among potential\nbeneficiaries remains as in the 1995 survey.", "40\nAppendix 2, page 3\nTable A2.1: Income Status of Farmer Households in the Project Area (1995)\nWater Supply\nItem Horticulture Livestock and Irrigation Total\nTotal\n    Households 185,222 21,000 18,645 218,367\n    Persons 775,034 89,073 51,277 916,104\nPer Capita Income in 1995 (yuan)\n<400\n    Households 31,780 1,381 0 33,101\n    Persons 136,804 5,383 0 142,267\n400 \u2013 530\n    Households 28,814 3,467 0 32,281\n    Persons 121,660 13,874 0 135,534\n531 \u2013 850\n    Households 66,118 7,905 210 74,233\n    Persons 280,065 33,301 840 315,000\n851 - 1,232\n    Households 40,799 3,020 2,422 49,041\n    Persons 164,576 26,261 10,210 201,047\n1,232 \u2013 1,578\n    Households 11,269 2,207 5,404 18,880\n    Persons 43,421 9,261 21,580 74,262\n> 1,578\n    Households 5,442 200 4,609 11,331\n    Persons 20,428 993 18,647 40,068\n11. Social development. Social development has progressed significantly in Henan and the\nPRC after the economic reforms. From 1978 to 1998, life expectancy at birth rose from 68.2 to\n70.8 years in the PRC, and from 68 to 70 years in Henan. The adult illiteracy rate declined from\n22.8 to 15.78 percent in the PRC, and from 21 to 14.44 percent in Henan.\nC.  Poverty Focus\n12. Poverty in the PRC.  The PRC has made significant progress in reducing the incidence\nof poverty and improving the living standards of the majority of its population. From 1990 to\n1998, the input of funds from the central Government to poverty reduction increased almost\nthree times. Using international standards, currently about 106 million people, or around 13.5\npercent of the rural population, live in poverty.8 Only 0.8 percent of the urban population live\nbelow the poverty line of $1 per day, but consumption requirements are higher and a poverty\nline of at least $2 per day is more relevant.  As a by-product of enterprise and other structural\nreforms, poverty is reappearing in urban centers and non-income poverty indicators may be\nmore important.\n                                                          \n8 In this period, the incidence of official absolute poverty declined from 9.4 percent to 4.6 percent in the PRC. Such\nabsolute poverty is concentrated in the remote and interior provinces. The latest official statistics suggest that\ncurrently about 34 million inhabitants live in absolute poverty.", "41\nAppendix 2, page 4\n13. Government policy toward poverty reduction has followed an area-based concept rather\nthan  beneficiary  targeting.  In  1994,  592  counties  were  identified  as  particularly  poor,  and\nGovernment  investments  were  concentrated  in  these  areas.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  and\nDevelopment Office (PADO) was set up at the national, provincial, and county levels to promote\narea-based development in poverty counties. Funds were used according to local plans for\nlabor-intensive  infrastructure  (particularly  farm-to-market  roads  and  irrigation),  agricultural\ndevelopment, and livelihood and rural micro-credit projects.9  PADOs at the local levels are\nresponsible for identifying projects and beneficiaries and maintain a very good recording system\nof poor households.\n14. Particularly vulnerable households such as those of the disabled,10 the elderly, those\nwithout shelter, (i.e., the five guarantee households) are supported by the Civil Affairs Bureau\n(CAB), which undertakes welfare work, distributes grain to households in need, undertakes\nsome livelihood training, and provides disaster relief.\n15. Poverty incidence in Henan Province. The rate of reduction of rural poverty in Henan\nhas been much higher than in the PRC as a whole.  Henan reduced its official rural poverty\nincidence from 16.5 percent in 1989 to 4.1 percent in 1998.  However, the incidence of absolute\npoverty  in  the  project  area  was  50  percent  higher  than  in  Henan  and  the  PRC  in  1998,\nindicating that the area needs special attention to poverty reduction. Henan has 10 percent of\nthe poor in the PRC, and 10 percent of the rural population.11 Between 12 million and 18 million\npeople in Henan are seasonal surplus laborers, and 6 million are employed in industry and\nservices.\n16. The provincial government of Henan (PGH) is highly committed to reducing poverty. Of\nthe Y18.3 billion budget provision for poverty reduction in 1997 from the central Government,\nHenan received Y1 billion, of which about Y360 million was allocated for the 12 poverty counties\nin the project area. In addition, the province, prefectures, and counties raised Y30 million from\ntheir own revenue to complement the budget in the poverty counties. Thus, each poverty county\nhas a budget of about Y60 million for poverty reduction.\n17. The remaining absolute poor and welfare households (about 0.25 million) in West Henan\nare often located in isolated upland regions with few natural resources and lack the human and\nphysical assets to benefit from or make use of economic growth. New approaches to poverty\nreduction programs and more sensitive targeting mechanisms may help to bring them into the\neconomic and social mainstream.\n18. The standards for defining poor townships and villages have changed with time. The\nstandards were Y1,280 and Y1,000, respectively, in 1998 current prices.  Poor townships and\npoor villages in Henan were 237 and 2,962, respectively. In 1998, 1.52 million poorest of the\npoor rural dwellers lived in neither national nor provincial poor counties, and accounted for 47.6\npercent of the total poor rural population in the province.  The poor population in nonpoor\ncounties were in 1,540 villages of 53 counties.\n                                                          \n9  Although the Government program has achieved remarkable poverty reduction, there are some criticisms about the\nsustainability  of  the  subprojects  and  the  spending  of  funds.  An  evaluation  by  the  former  State  Planning\nCommission showed that out of the Y10 billion special funds for poor counties allocated in 1994, Y2 billion was not\nproperly allocated or was misused\n10 Generally, the rural disabled are not included in the statistics of rural poor.\n11 In 1997, about 4 million people in Henan (5 percent of the provincial population) lived below the official provincial\nper capita annual poverty threshold of Y700 ($85), down from 13.8 million in 1986.", "Appendix 2, page 5\n4422\n19. Poverty in the project area. The poor population in Henan is unevenly distributed.  Of\nthe  17  regions  at  prefecture  level,  5  (Nanyang,  Luoyang,  Zhumadian,  Xingyang,  and\nPingdingshan) are considered particularly poor (Table A2.2). Three of the five regions in which\nthe poor population is concentrated are in the project area. According to the international\npoverty threshold, about 70 percent of the targeted households for horticulture and 61 percent\nof those for livestock in West Henan are living in relative poverty.\n20. Of the 22 counties and three other administrative areas or districts currently committed\nto participating in the Project, 9 are officially designated national poverty counties, but poverty is\nspread throughout all the project counties, even in the urban areas.  About 12 percent of the\n12.6  million  population  in  the  project  area  live  below  the  international  poverty  threshold,\ncompared with 9 percent nationwide.\nTable A2.2:  Distribution of Rural Poverty in Henan (1998)\nRegion Poor counties Poor townships Poor villages\n(%) (%) (%)\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0\nXingyanga 26.5 25.7 14.4\nLuoyanga 20.6 13.9 11.2\nZhumadian 14.7 9.7 11.0\nShangqiu 11.8 1.7 3.3\nNanyanga 8.8 9.7 10.1\nPuyang 8.8 12.2 7.8\nSanmenxiaa 5.9 2.1 5.2\nPingdingshana 2.9 9.7 9.1\nZhengzhou 0 2.1 4.1\nKaifeng 0 7.6 7.4\nXinxiong 0 4.2 5.2\nAnyang 0 0.4 3.0\nKebi 0 0.8 2.5\nJiyuana 0 0 2.5\nZhoukou 0 0 1.4\nJiaozhuo 0 0 1.2\nXuchang 0 0 0.5\na\nCounty within the project area.\nSource: Henan Provincial PADO.\n21. In  the  project  area,  41.6  percent  of  the  poor  rural  population  reside  outside  the\ndesignated  poor  counties.  The  proportion  of  the  poor  population  living  in  the  nonpoverty\ncounties has increased with time, mainly due to the effective regional targeting policy for poverty\nreduction.  Since the mid-1980s, poor counties in Henan have received poverty reduction funds\nof Y5 billion, while the poor households in nonpoor counties received almost nothing before\n1998. Compared with poverty in the officially designated poor counties, the situation of poor\nhouseholds in nonpoor counties is even worse. In 1998, the per capita income and consumption\nexpenditure for the poor in nonpoor counties were 9.1 percent and 8.8 percent lower than those\nfor the poor in the poor counties.\n22. There is a clear correlation between non-income measures and poverty in the project\narea (Table A2.3).  Poor families have less arable land, consume more than they earn, have", "43\nAppendix 2, page 6\nsmaller and poorer quality housing, and are more likely to be illiterate.  Accordingly, per capita\nnet income acts as an adequate proxy for other quality-of-life measures in the project area.\nTable A2.3:  Income distribution and variation of non-income welfare in project area\n(1998)\nY700- Y962- Y1,924- Y3,140- > Y6,280\nItem Average < Y700 Y962 Y1,924 Y3,140 Y6,280\nPer capita net income 1,912.7 550.9 842.4 1,437.0 2,388.9 4,030.3 8,320.1\nPer capita arable land (mu) 1.25 0.98 1.01 1.19 1.38 1.48 1.23\nPer capita consumption\nexpenditure 1,234.1 799.7 824.7 1,039.1 1,422.9 2,141.4 3,082.3\nPer capita housing area (m2) 24.3 17.8 18.6 23.0 26.2 32.8 36.4\nAdult illiteracy rate (%) 4.2 7.0 6.8 4.3 3.9 1.4 1.6\nSource: Henan Provincial Rural Social and Economic Survey Team\nD. Poverty Reduction as a Secondary Project Objective\n23. Strategic  thrust.  Sustainable  poverty  reduction  must  structurally  address  the\nsocioeconomic conditions that prevent poor people from creating opportunities for themselves\nand  allow  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders  to  include  vulnerable  groups  in  the\nsocioeconomic mainstream. Hence, projects with poverty reduction as a strategic development\nobjective need to change the underlying conditions that cause poverty, in addition to including\npoor people as project beneficiaries.\n24. Baseline socioeconomic information and the PGH commitment to poverty reduction\nhave been used to determine the new poverty classification most appropriate to the Project.\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) current classification system requires that in a project\nwith poverty as a secondary development objective, at least one third of direct beneficiaries\nmust be poor, or one or more of the project components and 20 percent or more of the total\nproject  budget  must  be  designed  specifically  for  the  poor.  This  Project  meets  these\nrequirements and adds a specific poverty targeting and monitoring mechanism.\n25. ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Agreement with the central Government will be prepared in\n2000. PGH indicated its strong support for the Project\u2019s help to the poor and noted that ADB's\nnew strategy is in line with current Government policy calling for sustained efforts to eradicate\nabsolute poverty. The project area poverty agencies and the Rural and Urban Investigation\nTeams of the Statistics Bureau will assist the implementing agencies (IAs) to select at least 40\npercent of the direct rural and urban beneficiary households with an annual per capita income\nlevel below $1 and $2, respectively. The agencies will use the established poverty recording\nsystem to monitor the contribution of the Project to poverty reduction. The agencies will prepare\nan annual progress report to be integrated in the progress report of the Project Management\nOffice (PMO), which can be used for further beneficiary targeting and adjustment of the project\ndesign.\n26. Generating income and employment. Project components are integrated to benefit the\npoor.  By (i) focusing on labor-intensive production in horticulture and livestock, (ii) assuring a\nfair  mechanism  of  income  distribution  between  pilot  enterprises  and  households,  and  (iii)\naddressing problems in the rural marketing system, the Project will significantly reduce poverty\nand promote equitable growth on a sustainable basis. The Project will also stimulate rural\neconomic growth (primary objective) and will directly benefit about 0.9 million people in West\nHenan.", "Appendix 2, page 7\n44\n27. During implementation, project impact data need to be generated: (i) the increase in the\naverage  per  capita  income  in  West  Henan  during  the  project  period,  (ii)  the  number  of\nhouseholds in the target area lifted out of poverty, and (iii) the Project\u2019s contribution to reduction\nof the incidence of poverty in the province.\n28. Targeting poor beneficiaries. PADO and other poverty agencies will work together with\nPMO  to  ensure  that  at  least  40  percent  of  the  beneficiary  households  are  currently  poor\naccording to international poverty definitions. However, selection needs to be carefully done so\nas not to threaten the economic viability of the subprojects. The selection process will be\ntransparent and villagers will be able to comment on whether the process is equitable and\naccurate.\n29. Financing ongoing poverty reduction. The Project will generate at the county level a\nsustainable mechanism to finance poverty reduction. By establishing a revolving fund, the\nProject will enable the county governments to generate additional income that can be targeted\nfor additional poverty reduction projects in agriculture. Early repayments from onlending to end\nusers will be channeled through the Provincial Finance Bureau (PFB) to supplement the budget\nof  PADO  and/or  the  participating  technical  agencies.  For  example,  the  provincial  poverty\nreduction budget for the 99 Henan counties is currently about Y60 million: Y30 million from the\ncentral and Y30 million from the local governments. The Project could generate about Y40\nmillion per year as additional agricultural funds for 22 counties in West Henan.\nE. Summary of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n30. Land totaling 2,448 mu (1 mu = 0.06 ha) will be acquired for the Project, and 367\nhouseholds (1,603 people) will need to be resettled. The RAP formulates measures to alleviate\nadverse  impacts  in  accordance  with  national  and  regional  laws  and  regulations  and  the\nresettlement  policies  of  ADB.  The  objective  is  effective  land  acquisition  and  resettlement\nactivities so that the production and livelihood of the affected population can be restored to the\npre-project level (if not higher).\n31. The pump site works affect Xipo village, Chencun Xiang, Mianchi County, and the whole\nvillage has to be relocated. Xipo has 29 households and a population of 130. The average\nfamily size is 4.13 persons, and the average farmland is 1.6 mu per person. It is very difficult to\nget drinking water, and the villagers fetch water 3 km away from the village. Accommodations\nare poor, and most villagers live in mudbrick and wood houses and caves. In 1996 (before\nrelocation),  the  average  annual  household  income  was  Y5,200:  Y1,800  -  Y3,000  for  4\nhouseholds, Y3,000 - Y6,000 for 19 households, and Y6,000 - Y9,200 for 6 households.\n32. The Xiduan village regulating reservoir affects Xiduan village of Chidi Xiang, Houhe and\nChencun villages of Chencun Xiang. There are 338 resettlement households (1,473 people).\nThe average farmland is 2.4 mu, and the average family size is 4.01. The average income per\nperson is Y2,295, 19 percent higher than the average for the county(cid:190)Y1,927.\n33. A  detailed  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  design  was  completed  in  1996  and  a\nResettlement Management Office was set up at Huaiba Water Resources Bureau.  The draft\nresettlement plan was reviewed by ADB consultants (and staff) at least three times since 1996\nand has been substantially improved by the time of appraisal. Two of the five planned new\nresettlement villages have already been set up, and 125 households (496 people) have been", "Appendix 2, page 8\n45 45\nresettled. Of the four planned schools, two have been set up and put into operation.  To date,\nan area of about 1,000 mu has been acquired.\n34. The RAP preparation encompassed the following steps.\n(i) Set up resettlement management organization.\n(ii) Determine the scope of land acquisition and relocation according to the project\ndesign.\n(iii) In accordance with the requirements of Reservoir Inundation Treatment Design\nSpecification for Hydropower Projects and  the  Physical Index Investigation\nGuidelines for Reservoir Inundation by Hydropower Projects issued  by  the\nMinistry  of  Water  Resources,  investigate  the  physical  conditions  in  the  land\nacquisition area. The social and economic conditions in the affected area of the\nProject are also to be investigated.\n(iv) Determine  the  appropriate  rates  of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement.\n(v) Verify the results of physical index investigation and household questionnaires.\n(vi) Select relocation destinations for the people to be resettled.\n(vii) Formulate livelihood resettlement plan for new settlers.\n(viii) Formulate  production  resettlement  and  income  restoration  plan  for  the  new\nsettlers.\n(ix) Formulate a resettlement implementation plan.\n(x) Before implementing the resettlement plan, provide systematic training to the\nstaff at the resettlement office.\n(xi) Formulate  reporting  mechanisms  and  hire  a  monitoring  and  evaluation\norganization.\n(xii) Prepare to organize for implementation.\n(xiii) Publicize the resettlement plan and seek feedback from affected persons.\n35. The county resettlement office formed a property measuring team with the townships,\nvillages, and production teams concerned, and the properties of the people to be resettled have\nbeen measured, calculated, and verified according to different categories.  The settlers are\ninvolved in the measuring process, the results are publicized on the spot, and the settlers\nconcerned  acknowledge  the  results  by  signing  the  documents.  The  results  are  posted  as\nbulletins, so that the settlers can monitor the calculated property results for the village. The\ncompensation rates and the amount for each household are publicized on bulletin boards, and\nafter verification by the resettlement household concerned, registration cards are filled out for\neach item and each household. Then the household, production team, village, township, and\ncounty sign and stamp the card. One copy is kept in archives, the other copies are kept by the\nresettlement  household  concerned,  the  Relocation  Branch.  and  the  Finance  Branch  of  the\nCounty Resettlement Office, respectively.\n36. The  survey  shows  that  367  households  (1,603  people)  must  be  relocated,  and\nproduction resettlement carried out for 1,551 people. The Project needs to acquire 2,448 mu,\nincluding 2,061 mu farmland, accounting for 84 percent of the total amount of land acquired.\nChannel construction requires the lease of 613 mu.  Houses totaling 48,046 m2 will be relocated,\nincluding 4,476 m2 brick-cement houses, 20,027 m2 brick-wood houses, 1,248 m2 brick caves,\n9,160 m2 earth caves, and 2,703 m2 houses of other types.", "Appendix 2, page 9\n46\n37. The land compensation rate for permanently acquired land is determined at six times the\nunit output, plus a resettlement subsidy at four times, giving a total land compensation rate of ten\ntimes the unit output.  The farmland compensation rate was calculated to be Y2,570 per mu. The\nannual output value of fruit orchards was calculated on the basis of produce and price, and a\nmature fruit garden ready for harvest was estimated at Y15,000 per mu, while an immature\norchard was Y4,500 per mu. The compensation for land for housing and public work areas is the\nsame as for dry land. In addition, each resettled household receives resettlement subsidies for\nmoving and transportation, material loss, loss of work, and others.\n38. Five new resettlement villages are planned: Xipo of Huaiba village, Dongling of Duancun\nvillage, West Slope of Duancun village, South Slope of Houhe village and North Slope of Houhe\nvillage.  The  new  villages  have  advantageous  locations  and  flat  surfaces.  Vacant  land\nsurrounding the villages ensures the potential for future development. More important, the new\nvillages are within 1 km of the original villages, so that the transportation, power, and water\nsupply facilities are easily upgraded.\n39. The following preferential policies apply to the resettled persons: (i) projects related to\nindustrial and agricultural production in the project area are given priority, and in the recruitment\nprocess, the workforce of the resettled and the residents of the relocation destinations are given\npriority; (ii) agricultural aid, poverty-aid fund, and other social development funds such as\ntransportation, post, education and health services are provided to support the livelihood and\nproduction activities of the resettled: (iii) housing construction for the resettled households is\nexempt from the farmland utilization levy, land utilization levy, real estate taxes, and other fees;\n(iv)  the  industrial,  agricultural,  and  animal  farming  levies  of  the  townships  are  adjusted\naccording to the impact after relocation; (v) stone, sand, and roof tiles for the construction of the\nsettlers' new houses are exempt from the mineral resource levy; and (vi)  a support fund is set\nup as a poverty-aid fund for the new settlers in later stages, to ensure that they can make a\nliving even in special circumstances. The settlers from the reservoir area also benefit from the\nreservoir  area  maintenance  fund  and  the  reservoir  area  construction  fund.  The  direct\ncompensation for such settlers (land, houses, relocation, and house construction subsidy) totals\nY22.3 million.  Relocation of public facilities costs Y4.8 million, while other costs are Y1.8\nmillion.  Combined with price and physical contingencies, the total resettlement cost is Y27.9\nmillion ($3.4 million), which has been incorporated in the project costs.\nF. Summary\n40. In summary, the Project is expected to bring direct benefits to approximately 205,000\nhouseholds.    The  plan  is  to  have  at  least  40  percent  of  poor  people(cid:190)according  to  the\ninternational poverty standard(cid:190)among the Project area beneficiaries. About 340,000 people 12\nare expected to increase their per capita income above Y1,000 as a result of the Project.\n                                                          \n12 The total number of beneficiaries is derived from the production models.  Counties responded to a questionnaire\nidentifying the poor townships and villages they would include in the Project, and the proportion of poor people\nwithin those poor areas identified for each project activity.", "47\nAppendix 3, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets Means of Verification Risks and Assumptions\n1.Project Goal\n\u2022 Promote  economic  growth \u2022  Increased

Project Leading Group\n1. The  Provincial  Government  of  Henan  (PGH)  has  set  up  a  West  Henan  Economic\nDevelopment Leading Group to provide policy guidance, supervision, and coordination for the\nProject implementation.  A vice governor heads the Leading Group, with directors of the Henan\nDevelopment  Planning  Commission  and  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (PFB)  as  deputies.\nDirectors  of  the  Provincial  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development  Office  (PADO)  and  other\nprovincial  rural  and  urban  poverty-related  agencies  including  the  Statistics  Bureau,\nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and sector bureaus of agriculture (BA), livestock (BL), water\nconservancy, and forestry (BF) are also members of the Leading Group (Figure A5).\nB. Executing Agency\n2. Under  PFB,  a  provincial  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  comprising  about  8\nprofessional  staff  will  be  responsible  for  supervision  and  management  of  project\nimplementation.  The duties of the PMO will include\n\u2022  providing primary contact with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Ministry of Finance\n(MOF), State Development Planning Commission, and other agencies;\n\u2022  formulating annual implementation plans and budgets;\n\u2022  supervising construction and quality control;\n\u2022  monitoring physical and financial progress, and preparing routine progress reports;\n\u2022  supervising international and domestic procurement;\n\u2022  organizing relevant institutions to monitor and evaluate project benefits;\n\u2022  setting up and managing the special fund for the ADB loan;\n\u2022  reviewing applications of withdrawal and fund disbursement to implementing agencies (IAs);\n\u2022  monitoring the impact of the Project on the rural and urban poor; and\n\u2022  coordinating collection and repayment of the loan.\n3. Within  the  project  area,  most  prefectures/cities  and  counties  involved  have  already\nestablished their own leading groups and PMOs.  The number of professional and technical\nstaff involved in the lower level PMOs is estimated to be 5-8 at each office.  The PMOs will be\nassisted by staff of the relevant line agencies.\nC. Implementing Agencies\n4. It was agreed that a small number of company + household models should be tried, on a\npilot basis, but most of the IAs will be either a township finance office or a township BA, BF or\nBL, with the choice determined by the local government involved. These \u201cultimate\u201d borrowers\nwould be responsible not only for entering into contracts with farmers, providing technical inputs,\nand arranging marketing of products, but also for repayment of the loan.\n5. Tree crops component. For the production of apples, kiwi fruit, Chinese dates, and\nmedicinal plants (eucommia and gingko), the Forestry Bureau will be the IA.\n6. Vegetables component. The agriculture component comprising 2,800 hectares (ha) of\nfield vegetables and 5,000 greenhouses will be implemented by the Agriculture Bureau. Part of", "Appendix  5, page 2\n61\nthe field vegetable component may be implemented with the support of the Jiyuan Vegetable\nSeeds Company Ltd.\n7. Livestock  component.    County/township  livestock  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for\norganizing implementation of beef, sheep, and goat production. The proposed breeding farm for\npurebred pigs will be implemented by a livestock company at the provincial level in Zhengzhou\n(Henan  Xinda  Livestock  Company  Limited).  The  breeding  farm  for  first-cross  pigs  will  be\nimplemented by the Jiyuan Dazhong Livestock Industry Company Limited, a limited liability\ncompany already successfully operating pig and poultry production enterprises.\n8. Water  supply  and  irrigation  component.  The  Sanmenxia  Huaiba  Water  Supply\nCompany  has  been  set  up  to  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  the  Huaiba  Water  Supply\nScheme.  This commercial enterprise will sell bulk water to (i) Yima and Mianchi Water Supply\nCompanies, which will construct, operate, and maintain water supply networks and treatment\nfacilities in Yima City and Mianchi County at commercial tariffs; and (ii) Mianchi Irrigation\nCompany, a commercial enterprise under the jurisdiction of the County Water Conservancy\nBureau, which will construct, operate, and maintain the irrigation distribution system and collect\nwater fees from the farmer beneficiaries.\nD. Financial Management\n9. MOF will be the principal Borrower. MOF will onlend the funds at the same interest rate\nand conditions (about 6.46 percent interest, 25 years maturity, 5 years grace period, 0.75\npercent commitment fee, and 1.0 percent front-end fee) to PFB. PFB will open a separate\naccount for the Project through which the funds for implementation will be channeled to the\nfinance bureaus at the prefecture/city and county levels of the project area. With the exception\nof  onlending  to  the  pilot  enterprises  and  water  supply  and  irrigation  companies,  the\ncounty/municipal finance bureau will take the foreign exchange risk. These bureaus will relend\nthe funds to the farm enterprises and participating households on terms and conditions that will\nvary according to the profitability of the activities and ability to repay the loans, according to draft\nloan agreements (between the finance bureau and ultimate borrower) submitted to ADB.\n10. Subject to the general principle that terms and conditions to end users will be no less\nthan commercial bank lending,1 the local government level will provide funds to end users in\nthree modalities.  First, to farmers, funds will be provided in local currency through township\nfinancial offices, at interest rates not lower than commercial bank rates for equivalent loans, with\nat least 4-year maturity and grace period of 1-2 years. Wherever possible, loans will be secured\nby fixed assets collateral under a formal loan agreement. However, it is accepted that poor farm\nhouseholds have extremely limited fixed assets of any value, so emphasis will be on careful\nselection of participants and group pressure, where appropriate. Second, to the water supply\nand irrigation companies, funds will be provided at the same terms and conditions as the ADB\nfunds, although these companies will take the foreign exchange risk.  Third, the pilot enterprises\nwill be expected to take the foreign exchange risk and will receive funds from the relevant\nfinance bureaus at interest rates not lower than commercial bank rates for equivalent loans,\nthus reflecting a balance of several factors including longer repayment terms (10-15 years) than\nfarmers, foreign exchange risk, and risk of nonrepayment to PFB.\n11. As the ADB loan will only provide 44 percent of the total project costs and few of the\nhorticulture and livestock activities are likely to be attractive to commercial banks, counterpart\n                  \n1 The Mission confirmed that the current interest rates on commercial bank loans in domestic currency for 5-year\nrepayment terms (generally the maximum term available) are about 7.5 percent.", "Appendix  5, page 3\n62\nlocal funding amounting to about $65.3 million is needed.  PFB will ensure that the relevant\nmunicipality  and/or  county  government  is  prepared  to  commit  the  necessary  amount  of\ncounterpart funding (up to $3 million - $5 million per county), to be released through the normal\nlocal  government  budget  mechanisms.  Counties  that  have  excessive  exposure  to  foreign\ncurrency debt or are not prepared to enter into additional debt will be excluded from the Project.\n12. PFB will establish a separate loan account (special account) in a commercial bank for\nthe ADB funds.  PFB will process loan withdrawal applications, following preparation by the\nprovincial PMO and certification by the provincial PMO that the relevant works or procurement\nhave been carried out to an acceptable standard. PFB will authorize the release of funds to\nbank branches at municipal/county level, where they can be withdrawn by the enterprise, PMO,\nor farm household (depending on which end user has incurred the authorized expense).  ADB\nfunds advanced to the special account will be reimbursed under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure\nprocedure.\nE. Procurement\n13. Generally the relevant level of the PMO will be responsible for procurement of goods\nand materials, which will then be distributed to either groups of farmers or individual farm\nhouseholds. For items that must be procured elsewhere in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) or overseas, the provincial PMO will be responsible for procurement by tender.  For items\nthat can be procured locally, the county PMOs will be responsible. The PMO will also be\nresponsible for procurement of training services, inspection/acceptance surveys, and technical\nadvice to farmers. The main exceptions to this arrangement will be procurement for the water\nsupply  and  irrigation  component,  which  will  be  undertaken  by  the  relevant  water  supply\ncompany, and procurement by pilot enterprises.\n14. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme will apply in procurement.", "Appendix  5, page 4\n63\nADB has approved advance procurement action and retroactive financing for certain items in\nthe horticulture and water supply components, amounting to no more than $6 million.\n15. PGH is aware of ADB\u2019s new anticorruption policy and indicated that severe penalties\nwould be imposed for any proven case of corruption during implementation.  PMO will make\nappropriate arrangements for independent inspection and auditing to ensure that the Project\nhas adequate checks and balances to avoid any possibility of corruption.\nF. Guidelines for Selection of Pilot Enterprises\n16. Introduction.    On  a  pilot  basis,  the  Project  will  provide  funds  for  development  of\nselected commercial enterprises connected to household production models. These guidelines\nprovide criteria for selecting enterprises. The guidelines seek: (i) consistency with overall project\nobjectives; (ii) financial and technical viability of the proposals; and (iii) financial, managerial,\nand technical quality of sponsors.\n17. The following criteria are to be applied in selecting applicant enterprises:\n(i) At  least  20  percent  of  the  enterprise  inputs  or  outputs  must  be  linked  to\nagricultural households of the project area of West Henan, with priority given to\nproposals that utilize the outputs of the Project\u2019s agricultural components.\n(ii) Priority  will  be  given  to  proposals  that  benefit  poor  households  and/or  are\neffective in creating off-farm employment in terms of investment cost per new job\nand share of labor in total costs.\n(iii) Proposals must be environmentally sound in input production and processing,\nincorporating adequate treatment and disposal of all liquid, gaseous, and solid\nwastes.\n(iv) The maximum loan per enterprise is $4 million.\n(v) Minimum pretax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 15 percent, and posttax\nFIRR is 12 percent after full allowance for all incremental cash flows.\n(vi) At least 30 percent of the new investment, excluding both working capital and the\nvalue of any existing fixed assets to be used, must be financed by sponsors\u2019\nequity.\n18. Enterprise qualifications. If the component involves a new, separate enterprise, then\nthe  following  will  apply  to  that  enterprise  and  its  principal  sponsor,  but  if  it  involves  the\nexpansion of an existing enterprise, the following will apply to the whole enterprise:\n(i) Borrowers must be small and medium-size shareholding enterprises with at least\na controlling 51 percent of the shares held by PRC entities that are neither\ndirectly nor indirectly State-owned, and in which management is autonomous.\n(ii) The ratio of long-term debt, including overdraft facilities and renewable short-\nterm loans, to equity should not exceed 70:30 and the liquidity ratio, including the\nportion of long-term loans due for payment within one year, should not be less\nthan 1.25 in any projected year of the proposed loan period.\n (iii) The debt/service ratio should also not be less than 1.25 at any time after the\nprojected level of full production is achieved.\n(iv) Sponsors  must  have  a  good  track  record  in  general,  financial,  commercial,\nprocessing and marketing management.", "Appendix  5, page 5\n64\nG.

Review of Proposed Horticultural Activities\n1. Hectare crop budgets and areas of development. The analysis of the horticulture\ncomponent was based on per hectare crop budgets for grafted apples, gingko, kiwifruit, grafted\nChinese  dates,  field  vegetables,  and  greenhouses.  Where  possible,  the  with-Project  case\nincludes an initial wheat and maize intercrop until the canopy is fully developed. The analysis\nalso factored in the impact of periodic crop failures for apple, kiwifruit, and gingko plantings, and\nuses conservative estimates for greenhouse and field vegetable production. To account for the\nfuture impacts of increasing surface water scarcity in the central part of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC), the analysis uses irrigation tariffs that increase faster than domestic inflation. The\nanalysis  assumes  that  kiwifruit,  gingko,  eucommia,  greenhouse,  and  field  vegetable\ndevelopment replaces the existing grain production, and accounts for this opportunity cost. As\nfarmers are presently planting areas in tree crops, the analysis assumes that the Project will\naccelerate a process that would otherwise occur over a period of 10 years. Table A7.1 gives the\nfull development yields expected under the Project. Table A7.2 estimates the per hectare\ninvestment costs and working capital required.\nTable A7.1:  Horticultural Yields with the Project\nCrop Project Yield (t/ha) Area (ha)\nApples 12.0 3,200\nGingko (fruit) 0.6 1,900\nKiwifruit 21.4 1,400\nDates (dry weight) 3.5 1,200\nEucommia \u2013 ratoon (every three years) Leaf: 2.2,  bark: 3, poles: 10 300\nEucommia \u2013 plantation (annual average) Leaf: 1.5, bark: 0.25 300\nSimple Greenhouse 142.5 83.5\nStandard Greenhouse 142.5 83.5\nField Vegetables 63.0 2,800\nTable A7.2:  Investment Summary of Horticultural Activities (Y/ha)\nOther\nCivil Works Planting Goods & Working\nCrop Labor & Equipment Material Materials Capital Total\nApples 484 950 11,730 3,750 2,797 19,711\nGingko 968 950 15,272 2,600 10,456 30,245\nKiwifruit 1,451 17,750 7,728 5,750 12,797 45,476\nDates 484 950 8,625 2,450 2,450 14,959\nEucommia 2,419 950 17,250 3,975 14,828 39,421\nRatoon\nEucommia 3,225 3,450 2,575 885 10,135\nPlantation\nSimple 840 8,150 1,600 677 11,267\nGreenhouse\nStandard 1,590 20,450 1,600 1,549 26,689\nGreenhouse\nField 1,650 22,500 450 8,856 33,456\nVegetables\n2. Summary of results.  At full development (9-10 years from the start of the Project), the\nproposed horticultural plantings have the potential to achieve sooner than would otherwise be\npossible in the project area an additional annual production of 38,400 tons (t) of early-maturing", "Appendix 7, page 2\n68\napples, approximately 1,140 t of ginkgo fruit, 30,000 t of kiwifruit, 4,200 t of Chinese dates, an\naverage 375 t of eucommia bark, 1,125 t of eucommia leaf and 198,400 t of vegetables.\n3. Based  on  the  following  budgets,  the  posttax  base  financial  internal  rates  of  return\n(FIRRs) to these horticultural investments range from about 14 percent (for field vegetables) to\nabout 17 percent (for apples and dates) to 20 percent (for greenhouses). Estimated benefits per\nhousehold are summarized in Table A7.3. The sensitivity of these base results to adverse\nchanges in output prices, operating costs, investment costs, and delays in benefits is presented\nin Table A7.4.\n4. Given its relatively small operating margin, field vegetable production appears to be\nsusceptible to variations in revenues and operating costs. The profitability of Chinese dates is\nless sensitive to such changes.  Apple plantings appear to continue to be profitable in the event\nthat the average farmgate price turns out 10 percent lower than the output price used in the\nbudget, which is a premium price for early-maturing varieties. The results for eucommia are\naverages based on the assumption that half of the cultivation will be through ratooning and half\nthrough an alternative plantation approach that provides a higher concentration of the active\nchemicals in the bark. Although the investment cost for ratooning eucommia is much higher\nthan the plantation model, because of several advantages ratooning appears to be the more\nprofitable and financially feasible choice.\n5. In economic terms, the proposed activities produce satisfactory returns, although these\nreturns appear to be more sensitive to changes in revenues than to changes in operating costs\n(Table A7.4). The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of apples, gingko, kiwifruit, and\neucommia are calculated to be about 14 percent each. At 27 percent, dates have a relatively\nhigh economic return primarily because, in the farm model, production and land taxes represent\na high share of the financial costs of production. Following grafting, the maintenance input and\nlabor costs of a stand are low compared with those for other tree crops. Greenhouse and field\nvegetable production generate economic returns approaching 26 and 22 percent. Farmers can,\nof course, reduce the risks pertaining to revenues derived from horticulture by diversifying their\ntree crop holdings. Households participating in field vegetable development may also secure\nseasonal stability in revenues by negotiating purchase contracts with vegetable processing\nenterprises.\nTable A7.3:  Estimated Household Benefits from Horticulture\nArea/ Average Total Average Total\nHouse- Total Net Net Net Gross Gross Gross\nHorticulture Area hold hh Income Income Income Income Income Income\nCrop (ha) (ha/hh) (\u2018000) (Y/ha)a (Y/hh) (Y\u2019000) (Y/ha)b (Y/hh) (Y\u2019000)\nApples 3,200 0.20 16.0 7,793 1,559 24,936 10,485 2,097 33,553\nGingko 1,900 0.07 28.5 11,174 745 21,231 7,694 513 14,619\nKiwifruit 1,400 0.20 7.0 23,392 4,678 32,748 26,842 5,368 37,578\nEucommia 600 0.20 3.0 10,807 2,161 6,484 7,926 1,585 4,755\nChinese date 1,200 0.20 6.0 2,384 477 2,861 6,678 1,336 8,014\nGreenhouses 167 0.03 5.0 102,209 3,407 17,035 223,709 7,457 37,285\nField 2,800 0.07 42.0 3,977 265 11,136 18,227 1,215 51,036\nVegetables\nHuaiba 1,300 0.20 6.5 7,793 1,559 10,130 10,485 2,097 13,631\nOrchard\nTOTAL 12,567 114 126,562 200,472\nWeighted Av. 10,071 1,110 15,953 1,759\nHorticulture\nWeighted Av. 10,241 1,469 11,682 1,674\nTree Crops\nWeighted Av. 9,496 599 29,771 1,879\nVegetables\nhh = households.\na Full development incremental gross margin after imputing labor costs.\n b Incremental gross margin after taxes and before imputing labor costs.", "Appendix 7, page 3\n69\nTable A7.4: Sensitivity of Returns to Horticulturea\nApple Gingko Kiwi- Chinese Green- Field Whole\nfruit Date Eucommia houses Veg.

The  Project  will  support  household  meat  goat,  sheep,  cattle,  and  pig  raising.\nApproximately 14,400 households are expected to participate in raising sheep or goats, 9,500 in\nraising  cattle,  and  2,000  in  raising  porkers.  The  budgets  for  livestock  activities  have\nincorporated the costs of annual animal mortality (and replacement outside normal culling) that\nshould be expected for households that are new to the activities (or new to the demands of\nmeeting certain levels of product quality), and that should be expected even in the presence of\nexcellent veterinary care. Table A7.5 summarizes the estimated investment cost per household\nfor each activity.\nTable A7.5:   Investment Summary of Livestock Activities (Y/farm)\nCivil Works Breeding Other Goods Working\nLivestock Labor & Equipment Animals & Materials Capital Total\nMeat Goats 150 800 3,000 60 1,025 5,035\nSheep 150 800 3,000 60 1,116 5,126\nCattle 225 2,206 4,000 380 3,018 9,829\nPigs 150 5,621 2,800 60 10,474 19,105\n7. At full development, household cattle raising will produce 15,580 18-month-old cattle and\nabout 2,375 aged cows per year. Sheep raising will produce 108,000 surplus animals per year,\nwith live weight of 5,400 t, and 14,400 aged sheep for slaughter at 936 t live weight. Meat goat", "Appendix 7, page 4\n70\nraising activity will produce 108,000 surplus animals per year having a total weight of 6,075 t,\nand 14,400 aged goats at 720 t live weight. The Project will also assist 2,000 households to\npurchase crossbred pigs for raising porkers. These households will produce about 68,000\nanimals annually. The local markets will absorb all annual meat production. Table A7.6 shows\nestimated benefits per household, by activity.\n8. The base FIRRs for meat goats, sheep, cattle, and pig raising investments are estimated\nto be about 18, 21, 17, and 20 percent, respectively. Together, these activities generate a return\nof  about  18  percent  (Table  A7.7).  The  meat  goats,  sheep,  and  cattle  raising  investments\nindicate relatively moderate risk. The porker production entails greater risk, which is mitigated\nby the company + household model, where the enterprise guarantees minimum protection\nprices.  Household  porker  production  also  operates  on  a  rather  narrow  margin.  At  full\ndevelopment, operating costs represent approximately 93 percent of the value of sales, chiefly\ndue to the feed requirements, as these households act as contract out-growers.\n9.  The base return to the cattle component appears satisfactory although, in general, beef\nproduction by households in the PRC may be marginally profitable in areas with inadequate\nfeed supply.  For the selected communities in Henan, with access to productive grassland,\nraising cattle should provide adequate financial returns. Households can also manage risks by\nraising different types of livestock.\n10. The base EIRRs for the household livestock production are estimated at 21, 23, 19, and\nabout 16 percent for the goats, sheep, cattle, and pig investments. The economic return to\nhousehold livestock production as a whole is almost 20 percent. Pig raising remains sensitive to\nvariations in revenues and costs. The EIRRs of other livestock activities display moderate\nsensitivity comparable with the results of the financial sensitivity analysis (Table A7.7).\nTable A7.6:   Number of Beneficiaries and Benefits per Household\nfrom Livestock Production\nTotal\nNet Total Net Gross Gross\nAnimals/ Total Income Income Income Income\nLivestock Head household Households (Y/hh)a (Y\u2019000) (Y/hh)b (Y\u2019000)\nCattle 19,000   2 9,500 1,522 14,457 2,422 23,007\nSheep/Goats 144,000 10 14,400 926 13,330 1,646 23,698\nPigs 4,000   2 2,000 1,818 3,636 2,328 4,656\nTOTAL 167,000 25,900 1,213 31,423 1,983 51,361\na Full development incremental gross margin after imputing labor costs.\nb Incremental gross margin after taxes and before imputing labor costs.\nC. Implications of Debt Financing of Household Activities\n11. Possible loan conditions have been calculated for the debt financing of each household\nactivity. The calculations are based on the incremental cash flows implied by the presented\nactivity budgets, assuming that household borrowing through the Project has a nominal interest\nrate of 8.5 percent, households provide all labor required for investments and operations,\nhouseholds on balance contribute 10-20 percent for input costs, interest payments can be\ndeferred and capitalized into total amounts of debt held, financing for operations are part of\nlong-term debt, and households self-finance the next period\u2019s input costs from the current\nperiod\u2019s retained earnings as soon as it is feasible.", "71\nAppendix 7, page 5\nTable A7.7:  Sensitivity of Returns to Household Livestock Production\nWhole\nPigs Goats Sheep Cattle Component\nFinancial Analysis\nBase Case IRR 20.1% 18.4% 20.7% 17.1% 18.4%\nYuan \u2018000 NPV 4,991 7,860 10,190 17,514 40,556\nOutput Prices \u2013 10 percent IRR -3.9% 9.9% 11.7% 11.5% 9.4%\nNPV -5,531 1,501 3,029 6,606 5,605\nSV -4.7% -12.3% -14.2% -16.1% -11.6%\nOperating Costs + 10 percent IRR -2.1% 11.6% 13.5% 12.9% 11.1%\nNPV -4,700 2,837 4,598 9,590 12,326\nSV 5.1% 15.6% 18.2% 21.9% 14.4%\nInvestment Costs + 10 percent IRR 18.3% 16.9% 19.1% 15.8% 17.0%\nNPV 4,659 7,310 9,640 16,281 37,890\nSV 148.6% 141.7% 184.9% 141.2% 150.7%\nDelay of 1 Year IRR 5.9% 10.4% 11.4% 11.5% 10.2%\nNPV -2,803 3,149 4,886 10,061 15,293\nEconomic Analysis\nBase Case IRR 15.5% 20.8% 23.1% 19.3% 19.9%\nYuan \u2018000 NPV 1,116 4,418 5,931 9,542 21,006\nOutput Prices \u2013 10 percent IRR -5.1% 10.9% 12.6% 12.8% 9.6%\nNPV -7,183 -575 323 1,076 -6,359\nSV -1.3% -8.8% -10.6% -11.3% -7.6%\nOperating Costs + 10 percent IRR -4.0% 12.9% 14.8% 14.6% 11.5%\nNPV -6,714 465 1,515 3,358 -1,375\nSV 1.4% 11.2% 13.4% 15.5% 9.4%\nInvestment Costs + 10 percent IRR 14.2% 19.0% 21.1% 17.8% 18.3%\nNPV 759 3,819 5,332 8,214 18,123\nSV 30.5% 73.5% 97.7% 71.7% 72.6%\nDelay of 1 Year IRR 4.7% 11.0% 11.9% 12.4% 10.4%\nNPV -7,776 -932 -77 710 -8,075\nNotes: NPVs, expressed in Yuan \u2018000, are calculated using the FCOC or OCC as appropriate.

Where investments in tree crops are replacing the existing cultivation of grain(cid:190)as is the\ncase for gingko, kiwifruit and eucommia(cid:190)and there is loss of income in the period prior to the\nmaturity of a tree crop, the calculations for total household debt financing and cash flows have\nconsidered amounts of credit for financing operating expenses that would keep the welfare of\nhouseholds about the same as without the Project. The scheduling of repayments for these\ninvestment loans are worked out with the assumption that household borrowings for operating\nexpenses in the period prior to a sufficient tree crop harvest are such as to allow households, in\nthe absence of adequate savings, to avoid becoming temporarily poorer while participating in\nthe Project.\n13. Of the horticultural activities, apples, Chinese dates, ratooned eucommia, greenhouses\nand field vegetables appear to be best able to accommodate repayment of credits within seven\nyears, or less, including two to three years grace. Apple financing appears feasible with three\nyears grace and a repayment period of four years. Eucommia development with ratooning could\nsustain repayment within four years following three years\u2019 grace. The grafting of Chinese dates\ncould  be  financed  with  repayments  over  three  years  following  two  years\u2019  grace.  The\ngreenhouses and field vegetables should repay credits within three to four years, including two\nyears  grace.  Kiwifruit  and  gingko  development,  however,  appear  difficult  to  finance  within\ncomparable periods of time due to the relatively long periods before maturity. One way to\nimprove the situation is to have households contribute more cash for the investments, but this\ncould conflict with the Project\u2019s poverty reduction objectives. The preferred response is to\naccord considerable flexibility in the amount and scheduling of credit repayments for these\ninvestments,  as  provided  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  some  grant  financing  from  local\nsources might be available.", "Appendix 7, page 6\n72\n14. While the investment costs for the two-sow model are high compared with those for\nother  livestock  activities,  the  operating  costs  are  also  high,  primarily  because  of  the  feed\nrequired. It is likely that these households will require five years to repay the credit following two\nyears\u2019  grace.  Also,  given  the  margin  on  porker  production,  it  would  be  some  time  until\nhouseholds are able to fully self-finance operating expenses. This is in contrast to the apparent\nability of households taking credits for cattle to repay their debts within five years, including two\nyears\u2019 grace. These households should then be able to finance their operating expenses within\ntwo years thereafter. Households borrowing for goats or sheep should be able to repay their\ndebts within four years, including two years\u2019 grace.\nD. Review of Enterprises\n15. Apart from the Huaiba water supply companies (see next section), the Project would\npartially  finance  the  investments  of  two  livestock  enterprises:  a  crossbred  piggery  and  a\npurebred piggery. One piggery, located at Jiyuan, would produce crossbred pigs for breeding\nporkers. The other, the Xinda company located near Zhengzhou, would produce purebred pigs,\nsome of which would be supplied to the piggery in Jiyuan.\n16. The  breeding  piggeries  will  produce  4,600  purebred  sows,  20,000  crossbred  sows,\n25,000 piglets, 11,200 porkers, and 1,240 culled sows each year. The FIRRs to the crossbred\npiggery  and  purebred  piggery  investments  are  estimated  at  22  and  13  percent.  The\ncorresponding EIRRs for these activities are estimated at 25 and 15 percent. In aggregate, the\nestimated base FIRR for the three livestock enterprise investments is about 19 percent. Their\naggregate base EIRR is estimated at about 22 percent.\n17. Purebred pig breeding, with an FIRR of about 13 percent, can provide a satisfactory\nfinancial return \u2013 provided that consistently efficient management and quality control can be\nimplemented.  The  returns  to  the  crossbreeding  piggery  investment  can  be  more  easily\naccommodated than those for the purebred breeding unit. A reduction in revenues of 10 percent\ndrops the base FIRR to about 11 percent, while the EIRR  would decline from 25 to about 16\npercent. In contrast to the purebred piggery these returns hold up well under other combinations\nof varied costs and income. As there is substantial cross shareholding in these enterprises, the\noverall result for the whole component is more significant and shows a robust result (Table\nA7.8).\nTable A7.8:   Sensitivity of Returns to Livestock Enterprisesa\nFinancial Analysis Economic Analysis\nItem Crossbred Purebred Whole Crossbred Purebred Whole\nPiggery Piggery Component Piggery Piggery Component\n1.

The water supply system will be designed to provide 3 m3/s in Phase 1, but parts of the\nconveyance system will be constructed to allow for the proposed expansion of the water supply\nin Phase 2 to 7 m3/s. The base case evaluation reviewed here does not incorporate any benefits\nof this second phase of construction. The evaluation reflects estimated losses of 5 percent in\nthe conveyance system and 8 percent in the distribution network. At full capacity utilization,\nelectricity costs for pumping will approach 90 percent of the operating costs.\n19. Demand projections for nonindustrial uses are based on projections by municipal and\nprovincial authorities. The rates of water consumption are assumed to be as follows: 100 liters\n(l)/person/day  for  urban  domestic  users,  70  l/person/day  for  urban  migrant  workers,  30\nl/person/day for general urban public use, 75 l/person/day for rural domestic users, and 50\nl/animal/day for rural livestock. Consumption levels are expected to reach these averages within\nfive years after water supplies are made available. Industrial demand in 2001 is based on\nexisting enterprises plus identified industries either planned or now under construction. The total\nannual demand is expected to exceed supply by 10 percent in 2001. As there will be excess\ndemand, the evaluation assumes that all nonindustrial water demands will be met before any\nindustrial demands: i.e., all of the excess demand will be industrial.\n20. The analysis calculates a return to irrigation development based on the establishment of\n1,300 ha of orchards following the expansion of water supplies. To approximate the net benefits\nof  horticultural  development  of  this  area,  the  analysis  assumes  plantings  of  kiwifruit  as  a\nrepresentative crop.\n21. The financial analysis uses revised investment costs and cost estimates for resettlement\nworks.  Using  tariff  information  provided  by  the  Sanmenxia  authorities,  the  FIRR  for  the\nproposed investment in the Sanmenxia Water Supply Company is about 11 percent. The FIRRs\nfor investments in the Mianchi and Yima Water Distribution Companies are estimated at 12 and\n8 percent, respectively. The overall FIRR for the development of water supplies is about 11\npercent. At approximately 14 percent, the returns to orchard development are comparable with\nthose to the horticulture component. The overall FIRR for the water supply component is\nestimated at just under 12 percent.\n22. Table A7.9 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis for this component. The Yima\nWater Distribution Company has lower returns and greater sensitivity than the Mianchi Water\nDistribution  Company  due  to  the  priority  given  to  nonindustrial  uses  and  Mianchi\u2019s  faster\npopulation  growth.

The EIRRs of the water companies are 16 percent for the Sanmenxia Water Supply\nCompany, 17 percent for the Yima Water Distribution Company, and 22 percent for the Mianchi\nWater Distribution Company. The total return to water supply (the water supply and distribution\ncompanies considered as a consolidated unit) is estimated at 16 percent. The EIRR of the\nirrigation company is calculated to be about 17 percent while the return to the development of\nthe  North  Irrigation  Area  is  estimated  to  be  near  15  percent.  The  overall  EIRR  for  the\ncomponent is estimated at 16 percent. The sensitivity of these base economic results more or\nless mirrors the pattern of their financial counterparts.\n24. The  estimated  base  EIRRs  for  the  water  companies  should  be  regarded  as  lower\nbounds as the economic value of the water supplied in the analysis was assumed to be no less\nthan its total financial value, which is related to the cost of its supply. In the future without the\nProject, the incremental supply of water for the area would be much less than with the Project,\nand the cost of supply would be much greater. The true economic return to the component is\ntherefore  likely  to  be  much  higher  than  presented  here.  Sensitivity  results,  based  on  a\nconservative economic value of water, suggest that the economic viability of the water supply\nscheme is assured.\nF. Overall Project Performance\n25. The base FIRR for the entire Project is estimated at about 14 percent. Component\nFIRRs range from 12 percent to about 19 percent. The corresponding EIRR for the Project is", "Appendix 7, page 9\n75\nestimated at about 17 percent, with a range in returns to subcomponents similar to those\ncalculated for the financial analysis. Sensitivity analysis (Table A7.10) shows that the Project in\naggregate is moderately sensitive to adverse changes in output values and operating costs, with\nlivestock  among  the  most  sensitive.  The  Project,  however,  has  a  large  number  of\nsubcomponents, covering a wide range of products. This diversity should reduce the probability\nof simultaneous adverse price and cost movements that would jeopardize the overall economic\nviability of the Project.\nTable A7.10:  Sensitivity of Total Project Returnsa\nOperating Investment\nItem Base Case Output -10% Costs +10% Costs +10% 1 Year Delay\nFinancial\nIRR 13.9% 10.2% 9.8% 12.7% 10.9%\nNPV 372,427 136,656 106,716 321,142 219,365\nSV - -15.9% 13.1% 39.2% -\nEconomic\nIRR 17.3% 11.9% 12.5% 16.0% 13.5%\nNPV 219,410 -4,500 19,839 179,109 78,809\nSV - -9.9% 10.9% 31.7% -\na  NPVs, expressed in Y\u2019000, are calculated using the FCOC or OCC as appropriate.
