In 2016, Cambodia had an estimated population of 15.2 million \n3. \nin  25  provinces,  26  cities,  and  numerous  district  cities.  It  is  mainly  a  rural  country,  but  rapid \nurbanization is expected to bring the urban population to 30% by 2030. Garments, construction, \nand  tourism  have  driven  Cambodia\u2019s  robust  7%  economic  growth  from  2013-2017.2  With  an \nincreasingly  urban  economy,  urban  services  contribute  to  environmentally  sustainable  and \ninclusive  growth  by  laying  basic  infrastructure  for  businesses  and  households,  creating  jobs, \nsafeguarding the surrounding environment, and reducing exposure to flooding and other extreme \nweather events. They also contribute to the health, welfare, and protection of Cambodia\u2019s people. \nStrong urban\u2013rural linkages mean that developments in Cambodia\u2019s growing provincial cities\u2014\nincluding  Battambang  (Battambang  Province),  Serei  Saophoan (Banteay  Meanchey  Province), \nand Stueng Saen (Kampong Thom Province)\u2014spread to rural areas where poverty is more acute. \n \nTonle Sap basin. The Tonle Sap basin is home to about a third of Cambodia\u2019s population, \n4. \nand nearly half of its population depends on the lake\u2019s resources, particularly its fish, for livelihood. \nThe basin hosts one of the most productive inland fisheries in the world, contributing about 60% \nof the country\u2019s total production. Between 1998 and 2013, Cambodia\u2019s urban population growth \nrate  of  about  4%  (one  of  the  highest  in  Southeast  Asia),  combined  with  unprecedented  rural\u2013\nurban migration, has led to significant growth in the basin\u2019s cities.3 The three project cities in the \nlargely  rural  region\u2014together  with  Kampong  Chhnang,  Pursat,  and  Siemreap\u2014are  key  for \neconomic growth in the basin and their development is linked to the surrounding environment. \n \n5. \nUrbanization and environmental impact. Rapid urbanization has resulted in significant \nenvironmental  impact,  including  pollution,  on  the  basin,  which  is  designated  a  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biosphere reserve. While flooding is \nimportant for maintaining the basin\u2019s ecosystem services, severe flooding can cause damage to \nlife and infrastructure and exacerbate pollution, as receding floodwaters leave accumulated solid \n\n                                                 \n1  The  project  builds  on  the  ongoing Integrated  Urban  Environmental  Management  in the Tonle  Sap  Basin  Project, \nwhich supports flood protection, wastewater management, and solid waste management in two other provincial cities \nlocated around  the  lake,  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  (Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB].  Cambodia:  Integrated \nUrban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project. https://www.adb.org/projects/42285-013/main). \n\n2  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018: How Technology Affects Jobs. Manila. \n3  Government of Cambodia. 2014. Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey 2014. Phnom Penh. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fand liquid waste. The basin\u2019s urban areas are located next to rivers and are sensitive to climate \nchange, with most experiencing flooding during the wet season.4 \n \n6. \nAccess to services. Except in Phnom Penh, the urban population\u2019s access to improved \nwater supply during the dry season was 69.7% in 2014, while access to piped water supply was \n42.2%. Wastewater  and  solid  waste  services  are  inadequate. While  about  80.2%  of the  urban \npopulation  had  access  to  improved  sanitation  in  2014,  69.3%  had  individual  systems  (septic \ntanks) and only 10.7% had access to sewerage and wastewater treatment.5 More than 75% of \nhouseholds in urban areas, excluding Phnom Penh, do not have access to solid waste services. \nRapid  urbanization  will  worsen  these  challenges.  The  main  reasons  for  these  service  delivery \ngaps are (i) inadequate coverage and delivery of urban environmental infrastructure and services; \n(ii)  inadequate  management  of  public  investments;  and  (iii)  poor  urban  planning  that  did  not \nconsider environmental management, disaster risk, and climate change events. \n \n7. \nPolicy  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2014\u20132018 \nidentifies key priorities for the urban sector, which include developing a national strategy for cities \nand master plans for urban infrastructure; ensuring environmental sustainability; installing solid \nand  liquid  waste  management  systems;  and  developing  laws  related  to  land  management, \nurbanization, and construction.6 However, the actions for sanitation and solid waste are not well \ndefined. Regarding sanitation, the National Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation (2003) calls \nfor greater private sector participation, improved cost recovery, cross subsidies where needed, \nautonomy of public utilities, and the establishment of a regulatory body.7 \n \n8. \nInstitutional  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT) \nhandles asset creation for urban sanitation, and the provincial Departments of Public Works and \nTransport  (DPWT) handle  operation  and  maintenance (O&M).  Solid  waste management  is  the \ncity\u2019s responsibility. Because of limited technical capacity in provinces and municipalities, MPWT \ncontinues  to  be  involved  in  the  construction  of  large-scale  infrastructure  such  as  sewerage \nnetworks, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and controlled landfills. \n \n9. \nRole of the private sector. Private sector investment in these urban services is limited, \ngiven the public nature of the assets, limited revenue potential, and limited capacity of the private \nsector. The exception is solid waste collection, where services are outsourced to the private sector \nin many cities, including the three project cities. \n \n10. \n\nProject-specific constraints. The project cities experience the following constraints: \n(i) \n\nIn Battambang, 56% of the population of about 160,000 has access to piped water \nsupply, but only 5% has access to sewerage because of the limited coverage of \nthe existing sewer network (west of the river). Ongoing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  projects  will  expand  water  supply  and  address  sewage  collection  and \ntreatment west of the river, but not to the east. Solid waste collection covers less \nthan 25% of the city\u2019s population. \n\n                                                 \n4  The Tonle Sap river, which connects the Tonle Sap lake to the Mekong river, reverses its flow seasonally. During the \nwet season when the basin is flooded, the lake\u2019s surface area is four to six times larger than during the dry season \n(Mekong River Commission. 2010. Assessment of Basin-Wide Development Scenarios: Technical Note 10\u2014Impacts \non the Tonle Sap Ecosystem. Phnom Penh). \n\n5  Footnote 3. Improved sanitation includes flush and/or pour flush to sewers, septic tanks, and pit latrines with slab. \n6  Government of Cambodia. 2014. National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. \n7  Of the three project cities, only Battambang has an existing wastewater system, for which tariffs are collected through \nthe water supply bill with a 90% collection efficiency. Private companies collect solid waste fees and cover 15%\u2013\n25% of the cities\u2019 populations. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\nAbout 46% of Serei Saophoan\u2019s population of about 61,000 and 35% of Stueng \nSaen\u2019s population of about 96,000 have access to piped water supply. They have \nno sewerage networks or WWTPs. About 20% of the population in Serei Saophan \nand less than 20% in Stueng Saen have regular solid waste collection, with waste \ndisposed in open dump sites.8 \n\n \n11. \nFinancial  management.  The  income  of  DPWTs  and  city  governments  is  highly \ndependent on national government transfers. DPWT revenue sources include transfers from the \nMPWT (more than 90% of revenue) and income from the sale and rental of properties, fines, and \npenalties. Major recurrent costs are salaries and administrative costs and O&M of facilities (mainly \nroads). On average, local revenues can only cover 10%\u201315% of recurrent expenditures. However, \nsurplus funds available for capital expenditures averaged $0.6 million\u2013$2.4 million in 2015\u20132017 \nfor the three DPWTs. For cities, local revenues covered only 14%\u201339% on average of recurrent \nexpenditures  in  2016,  with  the  remaining  expenditure  supported  through  national  government \nallocations, including for solid waste collection and cleaning of public areas. \n \nSupport for urban environmental services in the Tonle Sap basin. ADB\u2019s Tonle Sap \n12. \nBasin  Strategy  highlighted  the  importance  of the  basin from  an  ecological,  environmental,  and \npoverty perspective, while the Urban Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map highlighted \nurban  development  in  Tonle  Sap  as  one  of  three  priority  areas.9  The  Tonle  Sap  Urban  Areas \nDevelopment  Framework  (TSUADF),  2014\u20132030  identified  and  prioritized  urban  infrastructure \nneeds for the six largest cities and provincial centers in the basin.10 \n \n13. \nOngoing support in the basin. The ongoing first phase project focuses on infrastructure \ninvestments  and  services  (drainage,  flood  protection,  solid  waste  management,  and  a  natural \nwastewater treatment pond) in the two cities of Kampong Chhnang and Pursat. It also focuses on \nsmall-scale environmental improvements, coordination, and training.11 This project will continue \nthe programmatic implementation of the TSUADF by supporting the preparation of risk-sensitive \nurban master plans; providing urban environmental services that factor disaster and climate risk \nconsiderations;  and  strengthening  institutional  effectiveness  in  the  next  three  priority  cities  of \nBattambang, Serei Saophoan, and Stueng Saen.12 \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  urban \n14. \ndevelopment has focused on cities in the Tonle Sap basin, along the Greater Mekong Subregion \neconomic corridors, and in other provincial capitals, with investments in water supply, wastewater \nmanagement, flood protection, solid waste management, urban roads and markets. This project \nincorporates lessons learned, namely that (i) lack of financing for household connections and on-\nsite plumbing is detrimental to operational and financial sustainability of wastewater systems; (ii) \n\n                                                 \n8  Open dump sites have little or no solid waste planning, management, record-keeping, compaction, or covering. \n9  ADB. 2005.

Cambodia: \n\nthe  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Project. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/42285-013/main.  ADB  approved  the  first  phase  in  November  2015  and  declared  it \neffective  in  March  2016.  Detailed  engineering  design  and  bidding  documents  for  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  is \nexpected  to  be  completed  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018.  Implementation  delays  are  largely  because  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement challenges and the need to procure four separate consulting services packages, some \nof  which  were  not large  enough  to  attract  good consulting  firms.  These  lessons  have informed the  design  of  the \nproposed second phase of the project. \n\nin \n\n12 Other government, ADB, and development partner initiatives cover the urgent investment needs of the remaining \n\ncity in the TSUADF, Siemreap. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fdelays in consultant recruitment and detailed designs result in unacceptably long project start-up \nperiods;  and  (iii)  the  approach  to  land  acquisition  must  be  comprehensive  and  practical  and \naligned with the agreed resettlement framework.13 \n \nDevelopment coordination. ADB is a lead partner in Cambodia\u2019s urban sector. Project \n15. \npreparation involved coordination with other active development partners in the urban and water \nsector, including Japan International Cooperation Agency, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nand  the World  Bank.  Support from these  partners  has mostly focused  on  larger cities such  as \nPhnom Penh and Siemreap, with some engagements in cities such as Kampot, Kep, and Preah \nSihanouk. Besides ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency is the most active partner in \nthe sector, with a strong focus on Phnom Penh and strategic investments.  \n \nStrategic context. The project aligns with Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Development \n16. \nPlan and the MPWT\u2019s requirements for improved and effective urban sanitation and solid waste. \nIt  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for  Cambodia  and  the  Urban \nOperational Plan, 2012\u20132020, which encourages the economic competitiveness of cities, green \ndevelopment, and inclusive growth.14 \n \n17. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  By  2019,  ADB  will  have  ongoing  urban  and  water \nsector  projects  in  more  than  15  of  Cambodia\u2019s  26  provincial  cities.  ADB\u2019s  growing  program \nprovides  sufficient  scale  to  engage  with  the  government  on  (i)  strategic  and  policy  issues, \nincluding master planning (ii) developing road maps for financial sustainability of urban services \nwhich  include  differentiated  approaches  based  on  affordability  and  (iii)  exploring  innovative \nnature-based solutions, such as use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment.15  \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable,  inclusive,  equitable,  and \nresilient growth achieved (footnote 6). The project will have the following outcome: urban services \nimproved in participating cities.16 \n \nC. \n \n19. \nOutput 1: Urban environmental infrastructure improved. The project will finance (i) a \nnew  4,800  cubic  meters  (m3)/day  capacity  WWTP,  87  kilometers  (km)  of  new  sewers  and  a \n350,000 m3 landfill in Battambang; (ii) a new 2,300 m3/day capacity WWTP, 39 km of new sewers, \n17 km drainage network and a 48,000 m3 landfill in Stueng Saen; and (iii) a new 2,500 m3/day \ncapacity WWTP, 78 km of new sewers, 8.5 km drainage network and 130,000 m3 landfill in Serei \nSaophoan.17 It will also finance free house latrines for 760 poor households. The design of the \nWWTP, access roads, and drainage network will factor disaster and climate risk considerations. \n                                                 \n13 ADB  used  a  technical  assistance  grant  for  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  detailed  designs,  and  bidding \ndocuments from the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund (financed by the Nordic Development Fund and \nadministered  by  ADB),  in  conjunction  with  resources  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V),  to \nensure  higher  project  readiness.

By project effectiveness, the detailed engineering \ndesign  and  bidding  documents  for  wastewater  treatment  and  management  in  two  cities, \nrepresenting 40% of the project financing, will be completed. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nTechnical  due  diligence  confirmed  the  project  is  technically  viable.  Wastewater  and \n28. \ndrainage design is based on projected storm water runoff and wastewater generation, and the \nrequired  treated  effluent  quality  for  receiving  waters.22  Following  an  alternatives  analysis  that \nconsidered lagoon-based treatment systems and constructed wetlands, the MPWT selected the \nformer as a lowest life-cycle cost solution that are easy to maintain. In Serei Saophoan, the MPWT \nwill explore, during detailed design, the option to integrate a constructed wetland (nature-based \napproach) in the final stage of treatment. For solid waste, following an alternatives analysis that \nconsidered three options (controlled dump site, controlled landfill and a fully engineered sanitary \nlandfill). the MPWT selected controlled landfills for all cities, with sufficient capacity to house waste \nuntil 2040. It selected reinjection and recirculation as a practical option for leachate treatment, \nconsistent with ADB guidelines.23 The project will prepare closure plans for existing dump sites \nand  finance  the  rehabilitation  and  closure  of  two  dump  sites  on  public  land.  The  project  is \nclassified medium risk from future climate change impacts. The project design includes climate \nadaptation  and  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  for  the  WWTPs  in  Battambang  and  Serei \nSaophoan (including raising the WWTPs and access roads) and drainage networks where pipes \nare designed to cater to 10-year flood return periods plus a safety factor for climate change.24 \n \nB. \n \n29. \nEconomic analysis. The project is economically viable. The economic analysis followed \nADB\u2019s guidelines and covered 25 years from the start of implementation in 2019 to 2043. The \ndisability-adjusted-life-year approach was used to measure the health and environmental benefits \nof better wastewater management and the public health benefits from reduced inhalation of toxic \nfumes associated with burning waste as a result of the solid waste management components. \nAvoidance of flood damage and losses from disrupted economic activity during floods quantified \nthe benefits of better drainage. The overall project economic internal rate of return for the three \ncities is 16.9% for the base case scenario and 14.5%\u201316.8% for the sensitivity tests, above the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. \n \n30. \nFinancial  analysis.  Financial  due  diligence for each  subproject evaluated  the financial \nsustainability  of  operating  the  infrastructure,  including  O&M  and  any  required  subsidies.  A \nfinancial evaluation of the revenue-generating wastewater system and solid waste management \nin the three cities indicated that the government will be unable to achieve full cost recovery through \nits projected tariff collection. The financial sustainability risk rating is substantial and a subsidy or \nviability gap financing was estimated. For the wastewater and drainage subprojects, the MPWT \nsupported the Battambang DPWT to enter an agreement with the provincial waterworks to collect \na wastewater fee on the water bill and will support the other two DPWTs in establishing a similar \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                 \n22 The population density in the service areas (50\u2013150 people per hectare) is sufficient to justify centralized treatment. \nFor context, the average population density in Phnom Penh is 55 people per hectare. WWTPs will meet standards \nfor discharge into public water areas and sewers, i.e., 80 milligrams per liter of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand \nand 100 milligrams per liter of chemical oxygen demand (Sub-Decree No. 27 ANRK.BK on Water Pollution Control). \n\n23 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n24 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\narrangement. For solid waste, each city will develop a financial sustainability road map to increase \nservice coverage to 80% of the urban population and link compensation to the private operator\u2019s \nperformance. The government will ensure that MPWT and/or DPWT will cover any O&M shortfall.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nADB developed a risk assessment and risk management plan jointly with the government. \nThe  MPWT  has  experience  in  ADB-financed  projects,  and  procurement capacity  assessments \nhave concluded that the MPWT has strong capacity to conduct procurement in accordance with \nADB requirements. The financial management risk is moderate due to constrained resources for \nasset  and  financial  management.  A  time-bound  action  plan  will  mitigate  risks  through  (i)  loan \ncovenants  on  the  appropriation  of  counterpart  funds  and  anticorruption  measures,  (ii)  periodic \npublic financial management training, and (iii) additional mitigation measures described in the risk \nmanagement plan.25 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  MPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nThe project will directly benefit about 41,800 households, including 6,850 poor households \nand 7,940 households headed by women. It is classified general intervention. Through improved \nurban  services,  project  area  residents  will  benefit  from  reduced  loss  of  productivity,  medical \nexpenditures, and indebtedness. Pro-poor design features include (i) free sewerage connections \nfor  all  households,  (ii)  sanitation  grants  to  identified  poor  households  requiring  replumbing  to \nconnect to the sewerage system, and (iii) free toilets for poor households. \n \n33. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment identified \n(i)  limited  access  to  reliable,  safe,  and  affordable  urban  services;  and  (ii)  low  women\u2019s \nparticipation in sector representation as key gender issues. Women\u2019s priority concerns include \nimproved access to toilets, improved urban services, and affordable urban services. The gender \naction plan (i) has targets to increase women\u2019s representation in PMU and project implementation \nunit, (ii) includes gender-responsive measures in urban development strategy and urban master \nplans to ensure equitable access to urban facilities and services, and (iii) has targets for training. \n \nE. \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n34. \ncategories are as below.26 For facility sites to be acquired by the government after loan approval, \nMPWT  assessed  alternate  sites  at the feasibility  stage  and final  sites  will  be  confirmed  during \nimplementation based on topographic surveys, soil investigations, and detailed designs. \n \n35. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  initial  environmental  examination  report  and  three \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) covering all subprojects are based on the preliminary \ndesign.27 The MPWT disclosed the initial environmental examination report and the EMPs on the \nADB website on 9 May 2018. It will obtain approval from the Ministry of Environment after the \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB.

The  MPWT  carried  out  public  consultations  to  inform  the  project \ndesign  and  will  continue  to  do  so  during  implementation.  The  EMPs  detail  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  for  identified  impacts,  institutional  arrangements,  and  implementation \nbudget.  MPWT  will  oversee  EMP  implementation  with  the  PMC\u2019s  support  and  a  full-time \nenvironment PMU environmental safeguard officer.28 \n \n36. \nDuring project preparation, the MPWT confirmed sites for the two wastewater subprojects \nin Battambang and Stueng Saen. For the WWTP in Serei Saophoan and three landfills in three \ncities,  the  EMPs  include  a  preliminary  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  across  several \nalternate sites, which will be confirmed after approval. The MPWT selected these sites to avoid \nor minimize impacts. The project will have net positive environmental and health benefits through \nreduced pollution and floods. Construction will have short-term, localized impacts such as surface \nwater  quality  deterioration,  noise,  dust,  traffic,  and  waste  generation.  During  facility  operation, \neffluent discharges and landfill leachate will need to be carefully managed. These impacts can be \nprevented or minimized through EMP implementation, effective O&M, and capacity building.  \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  will  involve  the  acquisition  of \n37. \nprivately owned lands, resulting in temporary and limited permanent impact on incomes from loss \nof access to farming lands. No physical relocation is expected. During project preparation, the \nMPWT confirmed sites for two subprojects and prepared draft resettlement plans following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Cambodian  laws  and  regulations.  None  of  the  44  displaced \nhouseholds in Battambang will experience major impacts, but 12 of 20 displaced households in \nStueng Saen will experience major impacts. The MPWT has prepared a resettlement framework \nto screen subproject sites and guide the preparation of resettlement plans after the completion of \ndetailed engineering design for the four sites that will be confirmed after approval.29 The MPWT \nwill submit resettlement plans to ADB for review and approval before awarding any contracts and \nwill implement them before construction starts. Sites with category A impacts will not be financed. \nThe MPWT disclosed the resettlement framework and plans on the ADB website on 23 May 2018.  \n \n38. \nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance's General Department of Resettlement (GDR) has \nthe experience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement impact. The GDR will: (i) conduct \ntraining on ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement to build the capacity of relevant stakeholders; (ii) \nensure that any physically or economically affected persons are compensated at full replacement \ncost before civil works begin; and (iii) establish an effective, gender-inclusive grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of communities' concerns over project \nimpacts, with attention to vulnerable people. The PMU will have dedicated full-time staff to support \ncompliance with ADB safeguard requirements. The GDR will update the draft resettlement plans \nbased on detailed design and in accordance with the resettlement framework and will implement \nthem before civil works begin. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). The poverty and social assessment confirmed that \n39. \nCham,  Vietnamese,  and  Chinese  ethnic  minorities  (considered  indigenous  peoples  by  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) reside in the larger project service areas. The two subprojects with \nconfirmed sites will not adversely affect any indigenous peoples. For any unanticipated impacts, \nthe MPWT prepared and disclosed an indigenous peoples planning framework on 9 May 2018.30 \n\n                                                 \n28 The MPWT has implemented several ADB projects and understands ADB requirements, but the PMU does not have \n\nspecialist safeguards resources to date, which is why full-time staff will be appointed. \n\n29 Resettlement Framework; Resettlement Plan: Stueng Saen; and Resettlement Plan: Battambang (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n30 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n40. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 24). \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nRisks \nLack of financial sustainability from limited \ncost recovery and/or low willingness of \nhouseholds to connect to sewerage \nnetwork or pay for improved services \nConstruction delays from delayed approval \nand implementation of land acquisition \nand/or resettlement \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nThe project includes financing for free household connections and \non-site plumbing to ensure up-front connection of the households to \nthe system.
