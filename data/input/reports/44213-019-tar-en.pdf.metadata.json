The Secondary Education Sector Investment Program (SESIP) (2013\u20132023) will support \nthe government\u2019s reform of secondary education (grades 6\u201312) into a system that builds the \nfoundation for a skilled labor force and prepares youths to meet the requirements of a rapidly \ndeveloping  economy. 1  Tranche  1  (2013\u20132018)  and  Tranche  2  (2015\u20132018)  are  being \nimplemented. Tranche 3 of SESIP supports subsets of the government\u2019s Secondary Education \nDevelopment Program (SEDP) (2018\u20132023) which incorporated the Secondary Education Sector \nRoad Map prepared by SESIP. The impact will be a more efficient, equitable, and higher quality \nsecondary education system. The project aims at improved student outcomes in secondary \neducation and effectiveness of the secondary education system delivered through (i) enhanced \nquality and relevance of secondary education, (ii) increased equitable access and retention of \nsecondary education, and (iii) strengthened secondary education management and governance. \nTranche 3 will have $225 million funded from Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources.2 The key features are (i) results-based approach with the use of disbursement-linked \nindicators,  (ii)  use  of  the  country  system  in  financial  management  and  procurement,  (iii) \nstrengthened fiduciary oversight arrangement and management, (iv) introduction of single budget \nsystem, and (v) adoption of sector-wide approach.3 The World Bank will provide cofinancing of \n$500 million funded from the International Development Association, and $10 million grant \nfinanced by the Global Financing Facility. Tranche 3 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Bangladesh, 2018\u20132020.4 \n \n2.  Tranches 1 and 2 of SESIP have already implemented initiatives to strengthen the country \nsystems. First, SESIP introduced the National e-Government Procurement (e-GP).5 The Ministry \nof Education (MOE) was selected as one of the pilot ministries, and 620 national competitive \nbidding contracts were successfully awarded through e-GP. Introducing e-GP totally changed the \nconventional procurement practice in secondary education. It strengthens security, competition, \ntransparency, accountability, and efficiency in the procurement process. Second, on financial \nmanagement,  SESIP  successfully  introduced  the  centralized  and  internet-based  financial \nmanagement information system, Integrated Budget and Accounting System (IBAS)++, in the \nsecondary education sector, as MOE was also selected as a pilot ministry.6 With IBAS++, \nsecondary education system has improved in budget preparation, execution, and accounting. \nWhile good progress has been made, the system still needs continuous capacity development to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

Subsequently, \non 27 September 2013, the Board approved the provision of loans to Bangladesh under a multitranche financing \nfacility in an aggregate amount of up to $500 million equivalent. Tranche 1 (2013\u20132018) amounting to $90 million \nand Tranche 2 (2015\u20132018) amounting to $185 million were approved by ADB Management on 21 October 2013 \nand 20 November 2015 respectively. \n2  Scheduled for Management approval in February 2018. \n3  \u201cAll significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure program, under government \nleadership, adopting common approaches across the sector and progressing towards relying on Government \nprocedures for all funds.\u201d (M.

One covenant on audit was not met in 2015 and 2016 mainly due to \nlimited capacity on preparation of financial statements reports.7  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The government requested the technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the fiduciary \nmanagement of SEDP. The program will use the government\u2019s treasury system for disbursement, \nfinancial management, and procurement system. To mitigate fiduciary risks associated with \nhaving the government manage funds and account for program expenditures, the government \nand ADB agreed on a comprehensive fiduciary oversight arrangement for SEDP. They also \nagreed on the implementation of an action plan to improve practices in procurement and financial \nmanagement. The TA for the investment programs will specifically support capacity development \nin fiduciary risk management.  \n \n4.  The transaction TA will help improve the government\u2019s fiduciary risk management and \ncapacity at central and local levels. It will help develop the capacity to implement the ongoing and \nensuing projects. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, \n2018\u20132020.8 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n5.  Output 1: Capacity in fiduciary management improved.  The TA will support annual \nfiduciary reviews (AFRs) in 2019, which will examine annual financial statements and reports, and \nconduct in-depth reviews of fiduciary risks identified in the action plans. These risks may be \nsector-specific, such as payroll processing and school grants. There may also be issues raised \nby reviews and audits conducted by the executing agencies and the comptroller and auditor \ngeneral. The AFRs will include post-procurement review of at least 20% of the contract awards. \nIt will identify key areas which needs capacity development in fiduciary risk management and \npractices in procurement and financial management, including preparing satisfactory financial \nstatements and reports. Recommendations of the AFRs will focus on short-term and medium-\nterm action plans for institutional capacity development. These would include national seminars \non risk management in sector-specific areas for secondary education agencies, and training \nworkshops of local level stakeholders that have weak internal control capacity or large volume of \ntransactions. \n \n6.  Output  2:  Single  budget  system  smoothly  introduced.  The  TA  will  support  the \nintroduction of a single budget system in the program. To strengthen the financial reporting and \nmonitor the program\u2019s financial management on the single budget, the TA will support, guide, and \nmonitor the government\u2019s implementation of the Procurement and Financial Management Action \nPlan. One of the key outputs will be a technical guideline on single budget for implementation for \nthe program. The TA also supports in preparing satisfactory financial statements and reports, \nfollowing-up actions on audit observations, and preparing audit reports. Technical consultations \nand capacity building will start in the ongoing projects such as Tranche 1 and 2. \n                                                \n7  The first year\u2019s audit reports (2014) were satisfactory.
