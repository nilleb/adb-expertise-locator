Tranche 3 of SESIP supports subsets of the government\u2019s Secondary Education \nDevelopment Program (SEDP) (2018\u20132023) which incorporated the Secondary Education Sector \nRoad Map prepared by SESIP. The impact will be a more efficient, equitable, and higher quality \nsecondary  education  system.  The  project  aims  at  improved  student  outcomes  in  secondary \neducation and effectiveness of the secondary education system delivered through (i) enhanced \nquality  and  relevance  of  secondary  education, (ii)  increased  equitable  access  and  retention  of \nsecondary education, and (iii) strengthened secondary education management and governance. \nTranche 3 will have $225 million funded from Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources.2 The key features are (i) results-based approach with the use of disbursement-linked \nindicators,  (ii)  use  of  the  country  system  in  financial  management  and  procurement,  (iii) \nstrengthened fiduciary oversight arrangement and management, (iv) introduction of single budget \nsystem, and (v) adoption of sector-wide approach.3 The World Bank will provide cofinancing of \n$500  million  funded  from  the  International  Development  Association,  and  $10  million  grant \nfinanced  by  the  Global  Financing  Facility.  Tranche  3  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan for Bangladesh, 2018\u20132020.4 \n \n2. \nTranches 1 and 2 of SESIP have already implemented initiatives to strengthen the country \nsystems. First, SESIP introduced the National e-Government Procurement (e-GP).5 The Ministry \nof  Education  (MOE)  was  selected  as  one  of  the  pilot  ministries,  and  620  national  competitive \nbidding contracts were successfully awarded through e-GP. Introducing e-GP totally changed the \nconventional procurement practice in secondary education. It strengthens security, competition, \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  the  procurement  process.  Second,  on  financial \nmanagement,  SESIP  successfully  introduced  the  centralized  and  internet-based  financial \nmanagement  information  system,  Integrated  Budget  and  Accounting  System  (IBAS)++,  in  the \nsecondary  education  sector,  as  MOE  was  also  selected  as  a  pilot  ministry. 6  With  IBAS++, \nsecondary  education  system  has  improved  in  budget  preparation,  execution,  and  accounting. \nWhile good progress has been made, the system still needs continuous capacity development to \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2013.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Investment Program. \nManila. The framework financing agreement was signed by Bangladesh and ADB on 21 July 2013. Subsequently, \non 27 September 2013, the Board approved the provision of loans to Bangladesh under a multitranche financing \nfacility in an aggregate amount of up to $500 million equivalent. Tranche 1 (2013\u20132018) amounting to $90 million \nand Tranche 2 (2015\u20132018) amounting to $185 million were approved by ADB Management on 21 October 2013 \nand 20 November 2015 respectively. \n\n2   Scheduled for Management approval in February 2018. \n3   \u201cAll significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure program, under government \nleadership,  adopting  common  approaches  across  the  sector  and  progressing  towards  relying  on  Government \nprocedures  for  all  funds.\u201d  (M.

The program will use the government\u2019s treasury system for disbursement, \nfinancial  management,  and  procurement  system.  To  mitigate  fiduciary  risks  associated  with \nhaving  the government manage funds  and  account for  program  expenditures, the government \nand  ADB  agreed  on  a  comprehensive  fiduciary  oversight  arrangement  for  SEDP.  They  also \nagreed on the implementation of an action plan to improve practices in procurement and financial \nmanagement. The TA for the investment programs will specifically support capacity development \nin fiduciary risk management.  \n \nThe  transaction  TA  will  help  improve  the  government\u2019s  fiduciary  risk  management  and \n4. \ncapacity at central and local levels. It will help develop the capacity to implement the ongoing and \nensuing projects. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, \n2018\u20132020.8 \n \nB. \n \nOutput 1: Capacity in fiduciary management improved.  The TA will support annual \n5. \nfiduciary reviews (AFRs) in 2019, which will examine annual financial statements and reports, and \nconduct  in-depth  reviews  of  fiduciary  risks  identified  in  the  action  plans.  These  risks  may  be \nsector-specific, such as payroll processing and school grants. There may also be issues raised \nby  reviews  and  audits  conducted  by  the  executing  agencies  and  the  comptroller  and  auditor \ngeneral. The AFRs will include post-procurement review of at least 20% of the contract awards. \nIt  will  identify  key  areas  which  needs  capacity  development  in  fiduciary  risk  management  and \npractices  in  procurement  and  financial  management,  including  preparing  satisfactory  financial \nstatements  and reports. Recommendations  of the  AFRs  will  focus  on short-term  and medium-\nterm action plans for institutional capacity development. These would include national seminars \non  risk  management  in  sector-specific  areas  for  secondary  education  agencies,  and  training \nworkshops of local level stakeholders that have weak internal control capacity or large volume of \ntransactions. \n \n6. \nOutput  2:  Single  budget  system  smoothly  introduced.  The  TA  will  support  the \nintroduction of a single budget system in the program. To strengthen the financial reporting and \nmonitor the program\u2019s financial management on the single budget, the TA will support, guide, and \nmonitor the government\u2019s implementation of the Procurement and Financial Management Action \nPlan. One of the key outputs will be a technical guideline on single budget for implementation for \nthe  program.  The  TA  also  supports  in  preparing  satisfactory  financial  statements  and  reports, \nfollowing-up actions on audit observations, and preparing audit reports. Technical consultations \nand capacity building will start in the ongoing projects such as Tranche 1 and 2. \n\n                                                \n7   The first year\u2019s audit reports (2014) were satisfactory. The qualified audit reports in 2015 and 2016 do not show the \ninformation on program budget heads on eligible expenditure. Submission of the audit reports were also delayed. \n8   ADB. 2017.
