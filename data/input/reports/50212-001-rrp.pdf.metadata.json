To  reduce  risks  from,  better  plan \nfor, respond to, and recover from disasters, the country is taking important steps to improve its \ndisaster  risk management (DRM)  system. The  proposed  program  will  provide  the Government \nof  the  Cook  Islands  rapid  access  to  financing,  contingent  on  a  disaster  affecting  the  country.2 \nFunds will be used to help meet short-term, post-disaster recovery needs. To establish eligibility \nto access the contingent financing, the government has undertaken prior policy actions that (i) \nclarify and implement policy and institutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for \npost-disaster response and recovery; (ii) improve the disaster resilience of physical assets; and \n(iii)  expand  disaster  risk  financing.  Post-program  monitoring  will  ensure  continued  progress \ntoward attaining overall program goals. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment  context.  The  Cook  Islands  has  a  resident  population  of  about  14,974 \ndispersed across 15 small islands, comprising a land area of 67 square kilometers spread over \n2  million  square  kilometers  of  the  South  Pacific  Ocean;  70%  of  the  population  lives  on  the \nlargest island of Rarotonga.3 The economy is well managed, tax revenues are strong, and fiscal \ndeficits  were  below  2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  FY2010\u2013FY2015.  Although \nexternal debt is rising, it remains at a sustainable level (24.8% of GDP in FY2016) and is well \nwithin the government\u2019s threshold of 35.0% of GDP.4 The country\u2019s average economic growth in \nFY2010\u2013FY2015  was  2.2%  per  year,  driven  largely  by  strong  growth  in  the  tourism  sector, \nwhich accounts for about 60.0% of GDP.5 But this average hides annual fluctuations that have \nseen  GDP  growth  vary  from  \u20132.7%  to  4.8%  during  FY2010\u2013FY2015,  depending  on  changing \nexternal, trade, and investment conditions. \n \n4. \nDisaster  risk.  The  Cook  Islands  is  highly  vulnerable  to  disasters,  and  has  periodically \nexperienced  major  cyclones  that  have  caused  substantial  economic  damage  and  loss  of  life. \n(Tables 1 and 2). \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Contingent financing was previously used in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Rarotonga. \n\n4  A debt sustainability analysis, which ADB did based on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund template \nand guidelines, assumes long run growth of 2.0%, declining fiscal deficits from 0.5% to 0.1%, and inflation at 2.0% \nover the long term (ADB. 2016.

The Cook Islands: Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance. Washington, DC. \n \n5. \nThe  country\u2019s  high  exposure  to  disaster  risk  is  due  to  (i)  its  geographic  location  in  the \nSouth Pacific cyclone belt; (ii) the remoteness and low-lying nature of many of its islands; and \n(iii)  the  proximity  of  many  buildings  and  infrastructure  services  to  the  coast,  especially  on  the \nlargest island of Rarotonga. In addition, the heavy reliance on revenues from the tourism sector \nmakes the economy vulnerable to the impact of disasters. \n \nThe  financial  resources  for  short-term  recovery6 needed  to  reduce  the  economic  and \n6. \nsocial  impact  of  disasters  through  swift  action  are  likely  to  be  significant.  However,  the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands currently has few options for accessing sufficient post-disaster \nfinancing, leaving the country vulnerable to the impact of disasters. For example, in addition to \nthe  overall  impact  on the economy  indicated  in Table 1,  annual  GDP growth fell from  2.2%  in \n2004 to \u20131.1% in 2005, after four cyclones  in early 2005, before it recovered to 5.0% in 2006. \nThe average quarterly GDP growth was 0.8% in 2009, dropped to \u20132.7% following Cyclone Pat \nin 2010, and recovered to 0.7% in 2011. \n \n7. \nGovernment  strategy.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risk  posed  by  disasters,  the \ngovernment has put in place arrangements to cover different layers of disaster risk financing. A \ndisaster emergency trust fund\u2014established in 20117 with a current balance of NZ$1.5 million\u2014\n                                                \n6   Short-term recovery focuses on activities that continue beyond the emergency period to reestablish lifelines, and \nmay  typically  include  providing  temporary  shelter,  restoring  power  and  water,  clearing  debris,  providing  small \nbusiness loans and work assistance, and delivering critical stress debriefing to emergency responders and victims. \n7  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands.  2011.  Policy  Governing  the  Establishment  and  Operation  of  the  Cook  Islands \n\nDisaster Emergency Trust Fund. Rarotonga. \n\n \n\n\fwas created to serve as an initial source of government-allocated funds to respond to disasters. \nThe  government  has  also  taken  out  insurance  coverage  under  the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk \nAssessment  and  Financing  Initiative  (PCRAFI)  for  cyclones,  with  a  1-in-10-year  probability  of \noccurrence and payout based on the assessed severity of a specific cyclone. 8 The country has \nnot experienced a cyclone triggering a payout since it joined PCRAFI in 2014, but continues to \npurchase  cover  as  an  element  of  a  broader  risk  financing  framework.  However,  having  the \ndisaster  emergency  trust  fund  in  place  and  the  potential  for  an  insurance  payout  through \nPCRAFI is unlikely to be sufficient for the Government of the Cook Islands to finance the cost of \nshort-term recovery needs following a significant disaster. \n \n8. \nIn addition to taking steps to reduce financial exposure to disaster risk, the government \nhas put in place an improved DRM policy and institutional arrangements. Major DRM policy and \nplanning documents have been prepared. For example, the current national development plan \nincludes  a  specific  measurable  goal  to  strengthen  resilience  to  combat  the  impacts  of  climate \nchange and natural disasters.9 The Cook Islands was among the first countries in the Pacific to \nprepare  a  joint  action  plan  that  integrated  DRM  and  climate  change  adaptation,  including \nimplementation  arrangements  to  link  national  and  local  planning  systems.10 The  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Act, 2007 defines legal responsibilities for DRM and specifies the procedures for \nthe formal declaration of a state of disaster. \n \nADB  engagement  and  lessons  learned.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \n9. \nprovided  financial  support  to  the  Cook  Islands  to  assist  with  post-disaster  reconstruction \nfollowing previous cyclones, including for the procurement of materials and equipment, transport \nsupplies  and  personnel  to  disaster  areas,  civil  works,  and  the  restoration  of  major  productive \nactivities,  such  as  pearl  farming,  fishing,  and  agriculture.11 The  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure \nFacility 12  supported  the  development  of  a  10-year,  $211  million,  national  infrastructure \ninvestment  plan \ninto  broader \ndevelopment investments, and was endorsed by the cabinet in April 2015.13 The plan identified \npriority infrastructure investments, estimated to cost $57.8 million, that are designed to reduce \nand manage disaster and climate risks, including risk mitigation measures. \n \n10. \nIn 2015, ADB conducted a macroeconomic assessment (footnote 5) and recommended \nthat  the government  \u201ccontinue  to  build up  its  resilience and readiness  to  natural  disasters  and \nexplore financial  options  to  support  its cash  position  in the  event  of a  disaster.\u201d14 By  putting  in \n                                                \n8  Payouts  under  PCRAFI  are  determined  parametrically  based  on  the  assessed  severity  of  a  specific  disaster. \n\nthat  embedded  strengthened  disaster-resilient  principles \n\nPayouts commence with events of a 1-in-10-year severity; less severe events do not attract a payout. \n\n9  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands,  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  Central  Policy  and  Planning  Office.  2016.

All other \ninstruments,  including  emergency  assistance  loans,  are  processed  only  after  a  disaster \nhappens. Eligibility to access PBL financing is linked to the achievement of prior and continuing \nactions to strengthen disaster resilience, which is similar to the Cat DDO. \n \n12. \nImportant  lessons  learned  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  development  policy  operations  with \nCat  DDOs  have  been  taken  into  consideration  in  designing  the  proposed  PBL  to  the  Cook \nIslands, including:17 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nDisaster contingent financing is most effective as part of a broader disaster risk \nfinancing  program,  complementing  other  risk  retention  tools  and  risk  transfer \ninstruments.  The  primary  benefit  of  a  deferred  drawdown  is  that  it  is  quick-\ndisbursing,  providing  the  government  with  an  immediate  source  of  bridge \nfinancing following a disaster. \nFor the government to fully benefit from the quick-disbursing nature of contingent \nfinancing,  specific  institutional  arrangements  need  to  be  in  place  to  enable  the \nsubmission of a deferred drawdown request for funds post-disaster. \nFiscal  impact  studies  can  help  the  government  understand  its  expected  post-\ndisaster short-term recovery funding gap, which the contingent financing can help \nto close. \nFor DRM policy frameworks with multiple action areas across different sectors, a \ndialogue should be initiated with various line agencies during project preparation \nand  implementation.  Stakeholders,  including  line  agencies,  civil  society,  the \nprivate  sector,  and  academia,  can  contribute  to  DRM  through  their  regular \nprograms. \nContingent credit is an affordable source of financing that complements existing \nmarket-based disaster risk financing instruments. Contingent credit can be used \nin  combination  with  market-based  disaster  risk  financing  to  retain  the  risk  from \nsmaller, more frequent events, or to transfer the risk from less frequent, higher-\nimpact  events,  based  on  an  assessment  of  risks,  desired  coverage,  available \nbudget, and cost efficiency. \nTo optimize the timing and size of drawdowns, the soft trigger for disbursement, \nwhich is a standard feature of the Cat DDO instrument, needs to be supported by \nstrong analytics. \n\n                                                \n15 Since 2008, the World Bank has extended development policy loans with a Cat DDO to Colombia, Costa Rica, El \n\nSalvador, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, the Seychelles, and Sri Lanka. \n16 ADB. 2011.

The program supports a series \nof  actions  to  improve  disaster  readiness  (para.  19).  It  will  only  be  possible  to  quantify  the  full \neconomic  impact  of  the  program  after  a  disaster,  as  the  benefits  or  costs  avoided  will  be \ndetermined  by  the  scale  of  a  disaster.  However,  the  following  are  indicative  of  the  economic \nbenefits that are expected to flow from the program: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nimproved \n\na reduction in lives lost and injuries incurred during a disaster, reflecting a wider \nunderstanding of what to do in case of an approaching disaster due to improved \ndisaster planning, response preparation, and public training; \nreduced damage and losses to public and personal property due to (a) improved \ndisaster planning, response preparation, and public training; (b) better resilience \nlocation,  design,  and  construction  of  critical  public \nthrough \ninfrastructure and assets; and (c) a strengthened building code; \nfaster  removal  of  debris  and  hazards  with  flow-on  impacts  for  improved  public \nsafety due to pre-contracting and improved availability of post-disaster finance; \nfaster restoration of essential services due to improved planning, financing, and \npre-contracting  of  specialized  services,  allowing  for  reduced  public  and  private \ncosts through shorter business, office, and public facility closures; \na  more  effectively  coordinated  humanitarian  response  providing  temporary \nshelter,  food,  water,  and  sanitation  with  a  reduced  risk  of  outbreaks  of \nwaterborne diseases and other negative post-disaster health impacts; \nbetter targeted humanitarian responses and more efficient spending for recovery \nthrough more efficient development of damage and loss assessments; \nrapid  access  to  an  increased  balance  in  the  disaster  emergency  trust  fund,  the \nPCRAFI  insurance  premium,  and  funds  from  the  PBL,  which  will  provide  the \ngovernment with a larger pool of resources to finance its short-term, post-disaster \nneeds  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner,  and  avoid  the  opportunity  cost \nassociated  with  government  budget  or  aid  program  reallocations,  and/or  any \nfinancial costs  associated with additional  commercial  or  concessional  borrowing \nthat may be urgently needed to meet post-disaster costs; and \nrisk  of  corruption  and  unapproved  or  incorrect  expenditures  of  government  and \ndonor  funds  minimized  through  increased  transparency  and  closer  tracking  of \npost-disaster expenditures. \n\n \n\n                                                \n18  Other  developing  member  countries  with  access  to  ordinary  capital  resources  funds  in  the  Pacific  (i.e.,  Fiji  and \n\nPalau) have also indicated an interest in requesting similar support. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fPartner  support. Established in 2013, PCRAFI provides developing member countries \n15. \nin the Pacific with disaster risk modeling and assessment tools, and supports dialogue on and \nfinancing  for  integrated  financial  solutions  to  reduce  financial  vulnerability  to  disasters  and \nclimate change.19 The Cook Islands joined the PCRAFI insurance pilot in 2014, selecting a level \nof cover corresponding to a 1-in-10-year disaster\u2014the lowest level of cover with the least costly \npremium.20 \n \n16. \nNew  Zealand  provides  DRM  support  under  its  bilateral  aid  program  through  an \narrangement  with  its  Ministry  of  Civil  Defence  and  Emergency  Management.  The  Pacific \nCommunity is implementing Building Safety and Resilience in the Pacific, which is financed by \nthe  European  Union  and  implemented  locally  by  Emergency  Management  Cook  Islands.  A \nsecond  phase  of  PCRAFI  is  being  rolled  out  as  part  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  regional  Pacific \nResilience Program. \n \n17. \nADB priorities and contributions. ADB priorities in the Cook Islands are guided by the \nPacific  Approach,  which  serves as the  country  strategy for the  11  smaller  developing member \ncountries  in  the  Pacific.21 The  approach  focuses  on  a  three-pronged  strategy:  reduce  costs, \nmanage risks, and enable value creation. ADB\u2019s sector priorities in the Cook Islands are public \nsector  management,  energy,  information  and  communication  technology,  and  DRM.  ADB \nprovides a combination of investment projects, technical assistance, and policy-based lending to \nimprove  development  outcomes  in  these  sectors.  Planned  ADB  lending  to  the  Cook  Islands \nincludes projects for improving internet connectivity and renewable energy.22 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n18. \nThe  disaster  resilience  program\u2019s  impact  is  aligned  with  the  objectives  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Sustainable  Development  Plan  (footnote  9)  to  strengthen  resilience  to \ncombat  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters,  and  build  resilient  infrastructure. \nThe outcome will be adverse economic and social impact of disasters reduced. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe government has successfully accomplished 12 vital prior actions to improve disaster \n19. \nresilience,  which  are  presented  in  the  policy  matrix. 23  These  actions  provide  the  basis  for \nestablishing  eligibility  to  access  contingent  credit  provided  through the  proposed  PBL.  A  post-\nprogram monitoring framework has been agreed with the government to further strengthen DRM \nperformance. The program has three outputs: \n \n\n(i)  Output  1:  Policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  DRM  strengthened.  In \n2016,  the  cabinet  approved  the  National  Sustainable  Development  Plan,  2016\u2013\n2020  (footnote  9),  which  includes two  specific  objectives:  to  strengthen  resilience \nto  combat  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters,  and  to  build \nresilient  infrastructure.  Public  consultations  on  a  second  joint  national  action  plan \n\n                                                \n19  PCRAFI is a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, through its Applied Geoscience and Technology Division, the \nWorld Bank, and ADB, with the financial support of the Government of Japan and the Global Facility for Disaster \nReduction and Recovery. \n\n20  The maximum insurance payout to the Cook Islands for a 1-in-10-year attachment point is about $2.9 million. \n21 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n23 The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\ffor  DRM  and  climate  change  adaptation,  which  will  clarify  and  formalize  the \ninstitutional  arrangements \nfor  DRM,  have  been  completed  with  cabinet \nendorsement  of  the  plan  expected  in  2017,.  DRM  plans  covering  arrangements \nand  responsibilities for  local  governments  and  communities\u2014a  critical  first  line  of \ndefense in responding to disasters\u2014have been prepared for the 10 Pa Enua (outer \nislands)  and  are  being  prepared  for  the  10  punas  (local  government  districts)  of \nRarotonga.  The  government  is  ensuring  that  regular  meetings  of  the  National \nDisaster  Risk  Management  Council  take  place,  with  their  frequency  increased  to \nonce  per  quarter  by  the  end  of  2017,  in  compliance  with  the  DRM  Act.  The \ngovernment has taken steps to improve public awareness of disaster risks through \nthe preparation of DRM learning modules for schools, which were first distributed in \n2014  and  will  be  further  disseminated  in  2017;  and  the  development  of  training \nmodules, targeting key areas of DRM accountabilities relevant to each government \nagency, that will be disseminated in 2017.  \n\nInvestment  Plan  has  been  prepared \n\n(ii)  Output  2:  Disaster  resilience  of  physical  assets  improved.  The  government \nhas obtained information from registered contractors on the availability and price of \nservices  and  goods  for  post-disaster  cleanups,  such  as  debris  removal,  and  the \nrestoration  of  essential  services,  including  power  and  water.  The  National \nInfrastructure \nidentifies  priority \ninfrastructure  needed  to  increase  resilience,  including  risk  mitigation  measures \n(footnote  13).  The  government  has  also  put  in  place  a  requirement  that  all \nproposals for public investment projects over NZ$150,000 include an  assessment \nof  disaster  and  climate  risks.  In  2017,  the  government  will  further  enhance  this \nrequirement by designing and implementing a dedicated screening tool for disaster \nand climate risks. Preparations are underway for a revised building code, which will \ninclude specific standards for improving the disaster resilience of public and private \nassets, with cabinet endorsement expected in 2017. \n\nthat \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Output  3:  Disaster  risk  financing  expanded.  To  bolster  the  fiscal  buffers  for \ndisaster  response,  the  government  established the  disaster  emergency  trust  fund \nand  purchased  disaster  insurance  coverage  under  PCRAFI.  To  further  expand \ndisaster  risk  financing,  the  government  has  committed  to  continue  to  increase \nfunding  for  the  trust  fund  and  pay  the  annual  insurance  premiums  for  PCRAFI \ncoverage. The  proposed  PBL  will  provide  a critical  additional  and complementary \nlayer,  currently  absent,  for  disaster  risk  financing,  which  will  further  increase  the \ngovernment\u2019s  overall  fiscal  buffers,  enabling  the  country  to  better  respond  to  and \nbetter cope with the impact of disasters. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \nD. \n \n20. \nFinancing needs for post-disaster response and recovery provided under the PBL have \nbeen  determined  based  on  (i)  the  likely  fiscal  impact  of  a  1-in-10-year  disaster,  taking  into \naccount the resources likely available from domestic and international sources; (ii) the likelihood \nof a drawdown during effectivity of the loan; (iii) the need to ensure that the country maintains a \nsustainable level of debt; and (iv) costs associated with the continued implementation of actions \ncontained in the policy matrix (footnote 23). As the proposed PBL is for contingent financing to \nsupport  additional  public  spending  associated  with  short-term  post-disaster  financing  needs \nsuch as debris removal, restoration of key public services, and other priority expenditures that \nthe government may determine based on the severity of a disaster, there is no direct correlation \nbetween the loan amount and the cost of policy reforms as is the case with typical PBLs. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n21. \nThe government  has requested  a  loan of  NZ$13.95  million from  ADB's ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  with  repayments  calculated  based  on  a  disbursement-linked  amortization \nschedule,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nThe Ministry of Finance and Economic Management is the executing and implementing \nagency,  supported  by  key  government  agencies,  including  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister, \nEmergency  Management  Cook  Islands,  and  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands.  The  cabinet  will \nprovide  overall  strategic  guidance.  Individual  policy  actions  form  part  of  existing  sector \nstrategies  that  will  continue  to  be  discussed  with  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  groups \nduring program implementation. \n \n23. \nThe  program  will  be  implemented  up  to  31  December  2019.  It  is  designed  to  give \noperational flexibility in delivering disaster-responsive financing to the Cook Islands. Eligibility to \nwithdraw loan proceeds will be based on the achievement of prior actions in the policy matrix; \nhowever,  actual  withdrawals  would  be  deferred  and  only  triggered  in  the  event  of  an  official \ndeclaration of a state of disaster by the government, as defined in DRM Act, 2007. Following a \ndisaster,  but  prior  to  submitting a  withdrawal  request, the government  will  consult  with ADB  to \nensure  that  the  size  of  the  requested  withdrawal  is  consistent  with  the  scale  of  a  disaster. \nDuring loan effectivity, ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation of the agreed \npolicy actions, according to the post-program monitoring framework (footnote 23). Based on the \navailability of country program resources, ADB\u2014in consultation with the government and other \nstakeholders\u2014will  provide  technical  assistance  to  support  the  strengthening  of  DRM  actions, \nincluding activities to improve disaster preparedness and reduce disaster risk. \n \n24. \nLoan proceeds will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  disbursement-linked  repayment  schedule  will  be  used. \nDepending  on  the  assessed  severity  of  a  disaster,  the  government  may  choose  to  drawdown \nonly a part of the available program funds.24 A specific repayment schedule based on the size of \nthe drawdown and the remaining, unutilized funds will be calculated. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  envisaged  reform  impacts  include  (i)  a  clearer  DRM  policy  and  institutional \n25. \narrangements that will improve the country\u2019s preparedness for and response to disasters, (ii) the \nimproved  resilience  of  public  and  private  physical  assets  to  withstand  the  impact  of  disasters, \nand  (iii)  larger  fiscal  buffers  to  meet  financial  needs  during  the  immediate  aftermath  and  early \nrecovery  period  of  a  disaster.  Taken  together,  the  policy  actions  will  improve  the  ability  of  the \nCook Islands to better withstand and cope with the short- and longer-term impacts of disasters. \n \n\n                                                \n24 This is a similar arrangement to that used for the Public Expenditure Support Facility Program for Indonesia, which \n\nused installments under a single tranche (footnote 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe government is finalizing an updated PFM road map for 2016\u20132020 that builds on the \npositive progress analyzed in the 2012 and 2015 public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessments.  The  road  map  will  include  further  improvements  to  financial  management \nlegislation and tighter fiscal  responsibility  ratios  in relation to debt  targets,  cash  balances,  and \npersonnel expenses. In 2016, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management initiated the \nfeasibility  stage  of  procuring  a  single  PFM  information  system,  which  will  streamline  financial \nmanagement  practices  across  the  government.  A  public  sector  strategy  has  been  released, \nwhich focuses on three areas of public service performance: people, systems, and structures.25 \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe government and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nPolicy  actions\u2014based  on  three  outputs  designed  to  strengthen  DRM  policy  and \ninstitutional arrangements, improve structural resilience, and expand disaster risk financing\u2014will \nallow the government to maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster and enable the \ngovernment to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum delay, mitigating the immediate \neconomic  and  social  impacts.  Implementation  of  the  policy  actions  is  expected  to  continue  to \nstrengthen social protection arrangements that are already in place, ensuring communities and \nvulnerable households, including households headed by women, are able to reach safety in the \nevent of a disaster, have access to sufficient relief supplies to meet their immediate needs, and \nreceive support to rebuild their lives and assets. The PBL is classified some gender elements, \nwith  positive  poverty  and  social  impacts  through  stronger  DRM  that  will  equally  benefit  both \nwomen and men, and the collection of sex-disaggregated data to better monitor the impacts of \nand response to disasters. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nIn line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the PBL is classified  category C \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will be \nconfined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  none  of  the  activities  will  result  in  or  lead  to \ninvoluntary resettlement, nor will they negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \nStakeholder  dialogue  was  carried  out  during  the  program  design  and  will  continue  during \nprogram implementation. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 PFM systems are assessed as strong and \ngenerally able to support effective public service delivery. The remaining fiduciary risks will be \naddressed through policy reforms and technical assistance. The integrated benefits and impacts \nof the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n                                                \n25 Government of the Cook Islands. 2016.
