The  program  (i)  aligns  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  with  the \nRPJMN  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs);  (ii)  enhances  the  national  public \nexpenditure system; and (iii) improves fiscal transfers and spending for better service delivery at \nthe  subnational  government  level.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1. \nSubprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan (2018\u20132020) for Indonesia \nas a deliverable in 2018.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nProgrammatic approach and budget support. FPEMP uses a programmatic approach \n3. \nwhich aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program through a PBL over a medium \nto  long-term  time  horizon.  The  design  of  FPEMP  provided  for  targeted  support  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2015\u20132019 to reduce income \nand regional inequality.3 This objective is part of the second pillar of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership \nStrategy  2016\u20132019  which  seeks  to  enhance  economic  governance. 4  The  programmatic \napproach and subprogram 1 amounting to $500 million single tranche loan were approved by the \nADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  10  November  2016.  Subprogram  1  which  consisted  of  12  policy \nactions  mapped  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  with  the  RPJMN  and  SDGs  and \nimproved  public  expenditure  management  (PEM)  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels.  This \nprovided a basis for more targeted and efficient expenditure management and a foundation for \nthe reforms  in subprogram  2.  Subprogram  2  with  13  policy  actions  links  spending  with  targets \nunder the RPJMN and SDGs and strengthens PEM reforms by synchronizing planning with the \nentire  budget  cycle.  The  program  also  complements  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  revenue \nstrategy, which is supported by the World Bank.  \n \nThe program was designed to comprise two subprograms with the possibility of including \n4. \ntwo additional subprograms. This approach allows ADB to pace its support to the government\u2019s \nreform  efforts.  Based  on  the  government\u2019s  request,  FPEMP  will  include  a  third  subprogram  to \ncontinue  the  reform  momentum  and  strengthen  the  links  between  the  RPJMN  and  SDGs. \nSubprogram 2 improves budget preparation, transparency, execution, and monitoring, including \nimplementation of gender-responsive tagging and budgeting. Subprogram 3 will include 13 policy \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2016.

The government faces interrelated challenges of increasing \neconomic  growth,  alleviating  poverty,  and  reducing  income  inequality.  Indonesia\u2019s  economic \ngrowth  rate  declined  from  6.4%  in  2010  to  an  average  of  5.0%  from  2014  to  2017.  Growth  is \nexpected to pick up to around 5.3% in 2018, suggesting a gradual recovery toward its medium-\nterm growth rate of 5.6% (2010\u20132017).5 Reforms and the resulting growth have led to a reduction \nin the poverty rate from 24.0% in 1999 to 10.6% in 2017. However, this may still not be sufficient \nto provide employment for the 3 million additional people who attain working age each year. In \naddition,  close  to  40.0%  of  the  population  remains  clustered  around  the  national  poverty  line. \nThey are vulnerable to shocks such as food price increases, environmental hazards, and ill health. \n \n6. \nIndonesia has seen inequality  widen. The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has \nincreased at a faster pace (from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015 before declining to 0.39 in 2017) \nthan in neighboring Southeast Asian countries. The uneven nature of infrastructure investment \nand  economic  growth  across  provinces  has  also  widened  regional  income  disparities  and \ninequality. Further, Indonesia\u2019s social assistance programs have not adequately tackled poverty \nand income inequality. Social spending and social protection have long been used predominantly \nas a shock-coping mechanism rather than a long-term targeted program to reduce poverty and \ninequality. As a result, Indonesia has been less successful in reducing income inequality through \nsocial assistance programs compared with its regional comparators. Analysis in subprogram 1 \n(footnote 1) showed that in 2013, Indonesia\u2019s income redistribution and social assistance policies \nreduced the Gini index from 44.8 to 42.0, or by 2.8 points, compared with reductions of 4.5 points \nin Philippines and 4.0 points in Malaysia. Further accentuating the problem, one in four youth are \nnot in employment, education, or training (NEET). Young women are even more at risk, with 32% \naged  from  15  to  24  classified  as  NEET.  Those  categorized  as  NEET  come  from  low-income \nfamilies, and the job entry barriers they face often perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. \n \n\nFigure 1: Reallocation of Energy Subsidies to Social Sectors and Infrastructure \n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n2\n1\n0\n2\nHealth\n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nP\nN\nB\nP\nA\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nN\nB\nP\nA\nR\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n\nEducation\n\nEnergy subsidies\n\nNon energy subsidies\n\nInfrastructure\n\nAPBNP = Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara tahun anggaran (State Budget Revenue and Expenditure \nBudget Year). \nSource: Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance. \n\n                                                 \n5  The government forecasted growth of 5.4% for 2018, while ADB, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the \n\nWorld Bank projected growth of 5.3%. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\ni\n\nh\na\np\nu\nR\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\nr\nT\n\n500.00\n\n400.00\n\n300.00\n\n200.00\n\n100.00\n\n0.00\n\n\fIn  recognition  of  these  challenges,  the  government  in  2014  made  reducing  income \n7. \ninequality a priority in its national strategy. This strategy emphasizes the multidimensional and \nlong-term  nature  of  poverty  alleviation  and  differs  from  past  practices  by  reducing  universal \nsubsidies including regressive fuel subsidies in favor of more targeted social assistance programs. \nThis  coupled  with  reforms  in  tax  administration  created  significant  fiscal  space  for  increased \nexpenditure in education, health, infrastructure, and social assistance (Figure 1). After exceeding \ninfrastructure spending by 35% and aggregating 3 times the level of targeted social assistance \nspending in 2014, the energy subsidies declined significantly and represented only a fraction of \nthese  expenditures  in  2015. 6 This  shift  from  universal  subsidies  to  pro-poor  targeted  social \nassistance has been effective. Beginning 2015, the trend of increasing inequality reversed, and \nthe Gini coefficient dropped from 0.40 in 2015 to 0.39 in 2016, marking its first time below 0.40 \nsince  2011.  However,  reaching  the  government\u2019s  Gini  coefficient  target  of  0.36  by  2019  and \nreducing the poverty rate to below 10.0% from 10.6% in 2017 will require stronger economic and \nfiscal performance, coupled with targeted spending on education, health, infrastructure, and social \nassistance  programs.  In  addition,  the  public  expenditure  framework  should  be  enhanced,  the \nquality of service delivery improved, and access to finance increased. Programs also need to be \ndeveloped to help young Indonesians find quality jobs. \n \n8. \nBinding constraints. The government has identified the challenges it needs to address \nto  meet  its  Gini  target.  A  more  effective  fiscal  and  PEM  framework  will  be  required,  including  \n(i) alignment of medium-term expenditures with the RPJMN and SDGs targets, (ii) enhancements \nto the national public expenditure system, and (iii) improvements in fiscal transfers and the related \nspending by subnational governments for service delivery (paras. 9\u201312). \n \nMisalignment  of  medium-term  expenditures  and  programs.  The  government\u2019s \n9. \nmedium-term expenditure framework is anchored on both the RPJMN and SDGs. Achieving this \nalignment  requires  (i)  increased  pro-poor  budget  allocations,  particularly  for  education,  health, \ninfrastructure,  and  targeted  social  assistance  programs;  and  (ii)  improved  quality  of  spending \nthrough  better  governance  and  PEM.  For  example,  Indonesia\u2019s  index  for  allocations  to  higher \neducation was 20.4 points in 2016 compared with 29.6 in Thailand and 86.3 in Malaysia. Overall, \nIndonesia\u2019s higher education system scored 33.3 points compared with 39.7 in Thailand and 56.7 \nin Malaysia.7 Given the legal requirement to keep the deficit below 3% of gross domestic product \n(GDP), improvements in the quality of public expenditure will be required. \n \n10. \nSeveral constraints have been identified. First, until recently the government did not have \na high-level national coordination body for implementing the SDGs. Targets for the RPJMN and \nSDGs  are  multidimensional  and  require  implementation  of  several  programs  across  line \nministries. Without a national coordination body, the risk of contradictory implementation across \nministries  is  high.  For  example,  the  noncash  social  assistance  program,  started  during \nsubprogram  1,  needs  to  be  expanded  and  monitored  more  closely.  During  the  first  quarter  of \n2017, only 10% of the smart card beneficiaries received their benefits. Second, the necessary \nend-to-end coordination from planning, budget preparation, execution, monitoring, and reporting \nhas not been established. Without this coordination, priority programs will not receive sufficient \nbudget  allocations.  Moreover,  implementation  will  be  ad  hoc  and  monitoring  weak.  Third,  the \nexisting labor market programs are underfunded and not integrated and, therefore, have not been \neffective in tackling the high rate of youth NEET. \n\n                                                 \n6  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (Public  Expenditure  and  Fiscal  Management), \n\n(accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  R. Williams, A. Leahy, and P. Jensen. 2017. U21 Ranking of National Higher Education Systems 2017. Birmingham, \n\nUnited Kingdom: Universitas 21 (University of Birmingham). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f11.  Weaknesses  in  national  public  expenditure  management.  Indonesia  introduced  the \nmedium-term expenditure framework in 2011. However, weaknesses remain in budget planning, \nexecution, monitoring, and reporting, which impede pro-poor spending. Constraints include a lack \nof  budget  transparency;  inefficient  budget  planning  and  approval;  and  slow  budget  execution, \nespecially  for  capital  expenditure.  The  2015  International  Budget  Partnership  Report  scored \nIndonesia\u2019s budget transparency at 59 out of 100, due to limited disclosure of budget information \nto the public.8 In addition, the use of multi-year contracts is still low because provisions allowing \nits  use  are  narrow  and  spending  units  of  line  ministries  are  concern  if  the  use  of  multi-year \ncontracts may lead to allegations of corruption. This results in multiple procurements for single \nprojects, which is inefficient and increases project cost. Advance procurement in its current form \nis also not effective. Line ministries can only begin the tender process when budget allocations \nare  approved  in  November,  delaying  contract  signing  and  the  entire  procurement  process.  As \nrecently as 2016, 50%\u201360% of capital spending was disbursed in the last quarter. \n \n12. \nIneffective  fiscal  transfers  lead  to  poor  quality  of  public  service  delivery  by \nsubnational  governments.  International  empirical  studies  show  that  the  quality  of  service \ndelivery at the subnational government level is enhanced by efficient and effective fiscal transfers \nwith adequate monitoring.9 In Indonesia as of 2017, 53% of total government spending was at the \nsubnational government level, with 38% at the district level and 15% at the provincial level.10 This \ncompares  favorably  with  2000,  when  only  16%  spending  was  at  the  subnational  government \nlevel.11 Despite this progress, the following weaknesses remain in the design, coordination, and \nmonitoring  of  the  different  channels  of  fiscal  transfers  (from  national  to  subnational):  (i)  the \nconditions for subsequent disbursement of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) are not linked to \nabsorption and performance; (ii) the performance indicators of the Regional Incentive Fund (DID) \nare not clearly linked to the quality of public service delivery, particularly in education, health, and \ninfrastructure; and (iii) the transfers of the General Allocation Fund (DAU) and Revenue-Sharing \nFund  are  not  linked  to  reporting  requirements,  and  have  in  the  past  resulted  in  subnational \ngovernments  having  idle  funds.  Overall,  improvements  in  all  channels  of  fiscal  transfers  are \nrequired and more targeted expenditure is necessary to reduce regional disparities and inequality. \n \nB. \n \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s medium-term strategy is to create \n13. \nsustainable  and  equitable  economic  growth  through  optimizing  revenue,  improving  spending \nquality,  improving  subsidy  schemes,  and  decentralizing fiscal  authority. The  reallocation  of the \nenergy subsidy has provided an opportunity for the government to increase public spending on \neducation, health, social assistance programs, and infrastructure since the 2015 budget. This has \nhelped reduce regional disparities and strengthen basic service delivery. On the revenue side, \nIndonesia seeks to increase its tax-to-GDP ratio from about 10.0% in 2016 to 11.5% in 2018, and \nto 12.7%\u201313.3% by 2021. To support this increase, the government launched the tax amnesty \nprogram in 2016 to widen the tax base. This along with other tax administrative reforms brought \nin $10.2 billion in additional revenues and the tax compliance rate went up from about 63% in \n2016 to about 73% in 2017. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n                                                 \n8  International  Budget  Partnership.

Fiscal Decentralization and the Efficiency of Public Service Delivery. Washington, DC. \n10 Broadly, there are four types of fiscal transfers in Indonesia: from the: (i) General Allocation Fund (DAU) to support \nrecurring  spending;  (ii)  Specific  Allocation  Fund  (DAK)  for  specific  investment  expenditures  aligned  with  national \npriorities; (iii) Revenue-Sharing Fund, which covers natural resources; and (iv) Regional Incentive Fund (DID), which \nprovides an incentive to subnational governments to improve their performance. \n\n11 World Bank. 2017.

The  program  aligns  medium-term  expenditure  with  the  RPJMN  and \n14. \nSDGs targets, enhances national public expenditure system, and improves fiscal transfers and \nsubnational governments\u2019 spending for service delivery. The effect of these reforms is to increase \nand improve the quality of targeted spending through a better public financial management (PFM) \nframework. At the inception of the programmatic approach, the government agreed to accomplish \nsix expected prior actions (or triggers) and six policy milestones as a basis for subprogram 2.12 \nDuring processing of subprogram 2, a new prior action on synchronizing planning and the budget \nprocess was added, as it is a necessary reform to align spending with the SDGs. Subprogram 2 \nnow contains 13 reform actions (seven expected prior actions representing high-impact reforms, \nand six policy milestones), all of which have been accomplished. \n \n15.  Medium-term  expenditure  aligned  with  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \nand Sustainable Development Goal targets. This reform area supports SDG 3 (good health), \nSDG  4  (quality  education),  and  SDG  5  (gender  equality)  by  increasing  government  funding  of \ncore services and mainstreaming gender. Reforms completed in subprogram 1 included mapping \nof  the  SDGs  targets  against  targets  in  RPJMN  2015\u20132019  and  piloting  the  non-cash  social \nassistance program. Subprogram 2 builds upon these reforms with three key accomplishments.  \nFirst,  the  government  established  the  national  coordination  team  for  SDGs  implementation \nchaired  by  the  President  of  Indonesia.  The  team  monitors  and  provides  annual  reporting  on \nprogress  in  achieving  SDGs  targets,  including  those  related  to  gender. 13  This  up-front \ncommitment  by  the  President  was  based  on  lessons  learned  during  the  implementation  of  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  where  the  President\u2019s  involvement  was  limited  to  the \nlast few years of its implementation. Second, the government synchronized national development \npriorities  with  budget  preparation,  execution,  monitoring,  and  reporting  under  a  unified  results \nframework.  This  coordination  requirement  reflects  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  meet  the \nSDGs and to have a national budget with a focus on pro-poor expenditure to reverse inequality. \nFrom 2016 to 2018, budget allocations have increased as follows: (i) education, from $30.2 billion \nto $32.0 billion; (ii) health, from $7.6 billion to $8.1 billion; (iii) social assistance, from $10.4 billion \nto $11.8 billion; and (iv) infrastructure, from $23.0 billion to $29.8 billion.14 \n \n16. \nThird,  supplementing  the  increase  in  budget  allocations,  coverage  of  noncash  social \nassistance  programs  (smart  cards)  to  purchase  food  essentials  was  increased  to  1.4  million \nhouseholds, higher than the original target of 1.2 million households. The conditional cash transfer \n(CCT) program, that provides allowances based on the condition that beneficiary families access \nbasic health and education services, increased from 6 million to 10 million beneficiary families \nincluding approximately 125,000 pregnant women. A World Bank report estimated that the bottom \n30% of the population receive over two-thirds of the benefits from this program, on par with other \ninternationally  recognized  CCT  programs  such  as  in  Brazil  and  in  the  Philippines.15 The  same \nreport  estimated  that  expanding  the  CCT  program  to  6  million  households  could  reduce  the \npoverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points. Third, to address the problem of delayed delivery of \nthe  noncash  social  assistance  program  (para  10),  the  government  set  up  a  monitoring  team \nheaded by the minister of the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs. \n\n                                                 \n12 Prior  actions  are  considered  loan  disbursement  conditions,  and  policy  milestones  strengthen  the  program.  A \ncomparison of the original and the revised subprogram 2 is in Summary Assessment of Policy Actions (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 The National Development Planning Agency leads the national coordination secretariat for SDG implementation, and \n\nis also responsible for mainstreaming gender in national development plans. \n\n14 During the period of subprogram 2 (from September 2016 to March 2018), on an aggregate basis, there was a real \n\nincrease of 7% in the budget allocation for education, health, social assistance, and infrastructure. \n\n15 World  Bank.  2017.  Indonesia  Social  Assistance  Public  Expenditure  Review  Update:  Towards  a  Comprehensive, \n\nIntegrated, and Effective Social Assistance System in Indonesia. Jakarta. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fBy  the  end  of August  2017, more  than  95%  of targeted families  had received  assistance. The \nimpact  of  these  reforms  (2015\u20132018)  is  demonstrated  across  key  SDGs  indicators.  Maternal \nmortality rate has dropped by 14% from 2012 to 2017 and the percentage of deliveries in health \ncare  facilities  increased  from  77%  in  2016  to  86%  by  2017.  In  addition,  better  targeting  and \ngradual expansion of social assistance programs helped reduce the Gini coefficient from 0.40 in \n2015 to 0.39 in 2016 (footnote 6). \n \n17. \nFor subprogram 3, the government will develop regional SDGs action plan and adopt the \nNational Strategy for Accelerating Gender Mainstreaming. The government will also pilot labor \nmarket activation programs for young women and men categorized as NEET. \n \n18. \nNational  public  expenditure  system  enhanced.  This  reform  area  contributes  to \nimplementation of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Specifically, the government \nimproved  the  speed  of  disbursement  of  capital  expenditure  by  providing  greater  control  and \nflexibility over budgeting and procurement to line ministries. Reforms completed in subprogram 1 \nincluded implementation of online monitoring system for revenue and expenditure. There were \ntwo  key  accomplishments  under  subprogram  2.  First,  to  improve  budget  transparency,  the \ngovernment published a detailed medium-term fiscal framework in the Macroeconomic and Fiscal \nPolicy Framework. In addition, budget data was published in a dedicated portal, including a pre-\nbudget statement, and disaggregated budget data was based on thematic areas, including climate \nchange  and  gender-responsive  budgeting.  As  a  result,  the  International  Budget  Partnership \nconcluded that the government made all key budget documents publicly available in a time frame \nthat is consistent with international standards.16 \n \nSecond, efforts continue to simplify budget execution to expedite budgeted expenditures, \n19. \nincluding advance procurement and usage of multi-year contracts. The Presidential Regulations \non Procurement issued in March 2018 expanded the use of multi-year contracts. Line ministries \nwill  be  able  to  use  them  for  services  that  overlap  fiscal  years  and  for  recurring  services  or \ninfrastructure projects that can be shown to benefit from such an approach (even if the work is for \nless than 12 months). In addition, line ministries can better plan for advance procurement. The \nregulations  allow  line  ministries  to  begin  the  tender  process  when  the  estimated  budget  is \napproved in June. This is a significant reform, as previously the tender process could only begin \nwhen the budget allocation was approved in November. This will expedite budgeted expenditures, \nwhich have traditionally been lopsided toward the last quarter of the year. \n \n20. \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  improve  budget  efficiency  by  implementing  an \nelectronic budget request system. MOF will also issue implementing regulations to support the \nPresidential Regulations on Procurement to support use of multi-year contract. \n \n21. \nFiscal  transfers  and  subnational  governments\u2019  spending  for  service  delivery \nimproved. This reform area strengthened PEM systems at the subnational government level for \npublic service delivery. The impact of these reforms cut across several SDGs at the subnational \nlevel, including SDGs 3, 4, 9, and 16 (accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels). Reforms \ncompleted  in  subprogram  1  included  increased  and  better  targeted  fiscal  transfers  and \nimplementation of government bond transfers to address idle funds at subnational government \nlevel. 17 Subprogram  2  builds  upon  these  reforms  with  three  key  accomplishments.  First,  the \ngovernment provided direct allocations through local transfers in 2016 for community health care \n\n                                                 \n16 International Budget Partnership. Open Budget Survey. Indonesia. https://www.internationalbudget.org/budget-work-\n\nby-country/findgroup/group-data/?country=id (accessed 30 March 2018). \n\n17 Subnational governments with low levels of budget execution are given bonds in lieu of cash disbursements. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fand family planning, and more than doubled the allocations from Rp4.6 trillion in 2016 to Rp10.4 \ntrillion in 2018. Second, the government introduced a new compliance mechanism to strengthen \nmonitoring and evaluation of fiscal transfers. Disbursements will only be made after subnational \ngovernments  provide  full  accounting  of  previous  expenditures.  As  of  2017,  all  2,500  spending \nunits of local governments reported expenditure and accounting of the DAK and the Village Fund \nthrough the National Financial Management Information System (SPAN). Third, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) refined the governance performance indicators to improve the selection criteria \nfor  the  DID  by  linking  it to (i) fiscal management, (ii) the quality  of  public  service  delivery,  and  \n(iii)  the  human  development  index.  The  impact  of  these  reforms  is  an  improvement  in \naccountability  of  subnational  governments.  This  together  with  other  structural  reforms  has  the \npotential to reduce the cost for the government to raise capital necessary to meet SDGs targets. \n \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  implement  a  prior  action  to  improve  the  fiscal \n22. \ntransfers  to  make  them  more  predictable  and  to  link  the  DID  with  SDGs-related  indicators, \nincluding stunting and maternal mortality. \n \n\nFigure 2: Asian Development Bank\u2019s Engagement in Public Expenditure \nManagement and Structural Reform Agenda \n\n2014\u20132019:\nSector reform programs \nand loan for financial \ninclusion, energy sector, \nand investment climate \n\n2008\u20132012:\nLocal \ngovernment \nfinancing, governance \nreform program\nloan, and TA \n\n2001: Large-scale \nTA to set up basic \nPFM and PEM \nsystems, including at \nsubnational level\n\n2012\u20132017:\nTax revenue \nadministration and \npolicy improvement in \nlocal governments TA \n\n2005\u20132010:\nDevelopment \nPolicy Support \nProgram \n\n2016\u20132020: \nFPEMP and TA \nto support SDGs \nand employment \nprograms \n\n \nFPEMP  =  Fiscal  and  Public  Expenditure  Management  Program,  PEM  =  public  expenditure  management,  \nPFM = public financial management, SDGs = Sustainable Development Goals, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23. \nADB  experience.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  PEM  and  social  protection  through  a \nsequential approach (Figure 2). In 2001, ADB provided TA to set up the PFM and PEM framework \nat the national and subnational levels. This was followed by support for the government to build \na modern national PFM system, including a public debt management office in 2005. In the second \nphase  (2008),  ADB  provided  support  to  introduce  financial  management  information  systems \nwithin  147  local  governments  and  to  decentralize  the  tax  framework.18 Since  2012,  ADB  has \nprovided  TA  to  improve  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  social  security,  strengthen  the  fiscal \ndecentralization framework, and improve fiscal risk management of contingent liabilities arising \nfrom  accelerated  infrastructure  investment.19 ADB also  provided  support to the government for \nimplementation of the MDGs, generating lessons that have been incorporated into output 1 of the \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2016.

Complementing the program, \nADB also supports the government\u2019s efforts to improve its investment climate and improve access \nto  finance.  The  reforms  to  expand  use  of  advance  procurement  and  multi-year  contracts  are \ncomplimentary  to  the  reforms  to  improve  the  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure including to operationalize the joint Public-Private Partnership Office.20 \n \n24. \nLessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  provided  three  key  lessons  that  have  been \nincorporated into the design of the program. First, through ADB\u2019s program supporting MDGs, ADB \nlearned that meeting SDGs targets requires well-defined indicators, monitoring, and evaluation at \nthe subnational government level, all supported by reliable data collection.21 Second, responding \nto the challenges the government faced in meeting MDGs related to gender equality and maternal \nmortality,  the  implementation  of  the  SDGs  has  been  bolstered  by  the  National  Strategy  for \nAccelerating Gender Mainstreaming, which incorporates gender targets into the implementation \nof  SDGs.  Third,  social  assistance  programs  have  different  impacts  on  inequality  (footnote  6). \nThese programs require close monitoring and refinement to fully benefit the intended recipients. \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  program  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  long-term \n25. \nengagement  and  structured  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  helped  the  government  to \nprioritize  and  sequence  reforms  to  develop  the  SDGs  framework  and  design  policy  actions  to \nimplement SDGs. ADB supported the design and evaluation of the CCT program during the pilot \nphase.22 ADB also provided TA to support the introduction of SDGs by assisting the government \nundertake  a  fiscal  gap  analysis  for  social  assistance  programs. 23 In  addition,  ADB  provided \nsupport through sector-specific TA to implement programs linked with SDGs targets covering the \neducation,  energy,  and  finance  sectors.  In  the  health  sector,  ADB\u2019s  regional  TA  supported \ndiagnostics  on  national  health  insurance  to  support  the  government  achieve  universal  health \ncare.24 At the subnational level, ADB provided governance capacity development to 4 districts in \nEast Java to deliver good-quality education and health services.25 ADB\u2019s dialogue and assistance \nhave  strengthened  the  national  PEM  framework,  fiscal  transfers,  and  service  delivery  of \nsubnational governments. By 2017, the proportion of targeted national and subnational spending \nincreased  by  10%  to  approximately  Rp1,094  trillion  from  the  2015  baseline  of  Rp995  trillion, \nincluding  a  significant  26%  increase  for  infrastructure.  To  achieve  SDGs  targets,  ADB  also \nintroduced innovative labor market activation programs based on international practice and the \nexperience gained from ADB\u2019s successful implementation of similar programs in the Philippines.26 \n \n26. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination in the areas of PFM and PEM. ADB consulted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \non  fiscal  projections.  IMF\u2019s  research  and  macroeconomic  analysis  informed  the  design  of  the \nprogram. The program also complements IMF\u2019s recommendations to link the national strategy to \nSDGs targets. The policy matrix was jointly developed with the German development cooperation \nthrough  KfW. KfW and GIZ  also  provide  TA, to support  the government\u2019s  diagnostic  on  SDGs \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2016.

ADB  also  coordinates  with  bilateral  agencies  of  the \ngovernments of Australia, France, Japan, and the United States on PFM reforms.27 \n \nC. \n \n27. \nEconomic impacts of the program. This program addresses Indonesia's needs for fiscal \nreform.  It  supports  improvements  in  government  planning  and  public  investment,  and  it  aligns \nnational  development  with  implementation  of  the  SDGs.  The  program  impact  assessment \nestimates the net gains from these initiatives at $4.1 billion. A large proportion of the gross benefits \narise  through  returns  from  investment  in  education  ($3.8  billion)  and  via  the  mobilization  of \nunutilized government assets in the form of land and buildings ($2.0 billion).28 The total costs of \nreform  for  subprogram  2  is  $1.9  billion,  and  they  are  generated  by  additional  spending  on \neducation and social assistance, as well as by the costs of improved service delivery to the poor.29 \n \nD.  \n \n28. \nThe government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2.30 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest rate determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  average  loan \nmaturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW is providing collaborative financing for subprogram 2. The \nloan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, the development impact of the policy reform, \nand  development  spending  from  the  reform  (footnote  29).  In  2018,  the  government\u2019s  gross \nfinancing  need  is  $58.4 billion,  with  a  projected budget  deficit  of  2.2%  of GDP. To finance  the \ndeficit, the government plans to raise $43.8 billion from the issuance of securities and $3.8 billion \nfrom official foreign loans. \n \nE. \n \nThe MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency as the executing agency is responsible for coordinating \n29. \nprogram-related  reforms.  Implementing  agencies  include  the  directorates  general  of  budget, \ntreasury, and fiscal balance. The national SDGs committee monitors SDGs implementation and \nprogress  reports.  The  implementation  period  is  from  September  2016  to  March  2018  for \nsubprogram 2 and from April 2018 to December 2019 for subprogram 3. The proceeds of the PBL \nwill be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n30. \nSafeguards. Following evaluation of the policy actions, the subprogram will not have any \nlikely environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts. The subprogram \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n\n                                                 \n27 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Formal analysis of the Indonesian education system broadly suggests that a 20% increase in income, or uplift factor, \napplied to the minimum wage of $3,110 for the 550,000 students who are assumed to enroll delivers a present value \nof $3.8 billion. \n\n29 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPoverty  and  social.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \n31. \nIncreased expenditure in education, health, and infrastructure, as well as better-targeted social \nassistance, will reduce poverty and help the bottom 40% of the population, including pregnant \nwomen,  the  elderly,  and  people  with  disabilities,  to  have  access  to  basic  services.  The \ngovernment  developed  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerating  Gender  Mainstreaming.  The \ngovernment  also  provided  direct  allocations  for  community  health  care  and  family  planning \nthrough local transfers, with allocations more than doubling in 2018 compared to 2017. \n \nGovernance.  The  government  has  made  considerable  progress  in  improving  the  legal \n32. \nand regulatory framework for PFM. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state treasury, \nand  state  audit  in  2003\u20132004,  regulations  underpinning  these  laws  have  been  promulgated. \nGovernance has also improved, with 70% of subnational governments receiving an unqualified \nopinion for their financial reports. ADB has reinforced this momentum with continuing support to \nimprove  state  audit  capacity.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency. \n \nRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \n33. \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The expected net benefits and impacts of the \nprogram are expected to outweigh the risks. Inadequate capacity, especially at the subnational \ngovernment level, is a high risk that may slow the implementation of the SDGs. ADB is providing \nTA to improve capacity for SDGs implementation in health and education (footnotes 24\u201325). \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n34. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nagreement.
