The project is in O Mon district in the city of \nCan Tho, about 250 kilometers south of Ho Chi Minh City.2 The project will help Viet Nam meet \nfoster  socioeconomic  development  and \nto \nthe \nindustrialization  in  the  south,  particularly  in the  Mekong  Delta.  The  project  is  part  of  the  least-\ncost  Seventh  Master  Power  Development  Plan  approved  by  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  in \n2011. \n\nfast-growing  demand \n\nfor  electricity \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nMeeting  the  demand.  Strong  economic  growth  (about  8%  a  year  during  the  past \n3. \ndecade),  rapid  industrialization,  an  expansion  of  business  and  services,  coupled  with  rising \nhousehold  consumptions  have  been  the  causes  of  the  electricity  demand  growth.  Electricity \nconsumption grew at an annual average of 15% per year in 2000\u20132009 and accelerated to 18% \nin 2010. Electricity demand is projected to continue to grow rapidly: 13% per year in 2011\u20132015, \n11% per year in 2015\u20132020, and 9% per year in 2020\u20132025 according to the Seventh Master \nPower  Development  Plan.  From  1995  to  2009,  household  access  to  electricity  increased  from \n50% to more than 94%, and per capita electricity consumption rose during the same period from \n156  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  to  about  900 kWh.  Rapid  economic  growth  has  helped  Viet  Nam \nreduce the share of the population below the poverty line from 58% in 1993 to 13% in 2009. \n \n4. \nTo  meet  this  rapidly  growing  demand  for  electricity,  the  government  plans  to  increase \ngenerating capacity by maximizing use of the country\u2019s energy resources.  Despite construction \nof new generating capacity, power shortage still occurs in the country as electricity demand still \noutstrips supply3. To address this deficit and improve the quality and reliability of the electricity \nsupply to consumers, the government plans to increase generating capacity from 18,481 MW in \n2010 to 35,000 MW in 2015 and 60,000 MW in 2020.  \n \n5. \nIn the south, where natural gas is available, several gas-based power complexes have \nbeen built, including Phu My (4,000 MW), Nhon Trach (1,500 MW), and Ca Mau (1,500 MW). A \nconsortium comprising Chevron and the PetroVietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN) is developing \nBlock B/52 in the Gulf of Thailand and transporting the natural gas to the O Mon power complex \nfor  electricity  generation.  The  O  Mon  IV  power  plant  is  one  of  the  four  power  plants  to  be \ndeveloped at the complex to meet the growing demand for electricity in southern Viet Nam.  \n \n6. \nMeeting  investment  requirements.  To  build  a  sufficient  power  system  (including \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution), Viet Nam must mobilize about $44 billion for 2010\u2013\n2015,  of  which  about  $27  billion  will  be  invested  in  new  generation  facilities  and  $17  billion  in \ntransmission  and  distribution  facilities.  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  is  expected  to  mobilize \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2006.  Technical \nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Support for Public\u2013Private Development of the \nO Mon Thermal Power Complex Project. Manila (TA 4845-VIE). \n\n3  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  reported  that  in  April\u2013June  2010  the  power  shortage  was  more  than  500  gigawatt-hours \n\n(GWh). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n$32.7  billion.  The  balance  of  $11.3  billion  will  come  from  non-EVN  domestic  and  international \ninvestors.  The  financing  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  O Mon  IV  is \nessential for EVN and the government to meet its investment requirement. \n \nPublic\u2013private partnership. The private sector already plays a significant role in power \n7. \ngeneration.  Of  the  18,481  MW  of  installed  generating  capacity,  EVN  accounts  for  66%, \nindependent  power  producers  24%,  and  BOT  projects  10%.  The  government  has  adopted  a \nunique public\u2013private partnership (PPP) approach where a power complex hosts both an EVN \npower  plant  and  a  privately  owned  power  plant.  The  project  site  and  its  common  facilities  are \ndeveloped by EVN with public financing. ADB has provided such financing to a number of PPP \nprojects, for example, the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project, the Phu My 2.2, and Phu My 3 \ngas-fired combined cycle power projects. This approach creates incentives for private sector in \nutilizing the common facilities provided by EVN. A similar approach is being used at the O Mon \npower complex, where EVN invests in O Mon IV and invites private investors to invest in O Mon \nII.4 ADB  in  helping  EVN  finance  O  Mon  IV  and  the  government  in  bidding  out  O  Mon  II,  is \nfacilitating PPP for the development of the O Mon power complex. \n \n8. \nPromoting state of the art technology. ADB's assistance to the O Mon power complex \nis  not  limited  to  financing  O  Mon  IV.  ADB  financed  and  coordinated  a  number  of  studies  that \ndemonstrated various gas supply\u2014consumption scenarios and related gas pricing. The O Mon \ncomplex (3,600 MW) will generate electricity using gas, a cleaner fuel than coal alternative. As \nCCGT is an eligible technology for consideration under the Clean Development Mechanism of \nthe  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  the  ADB  technical \nsupport  facility  assisted  EVN  in  preparing  the  project  design  document  for  submission  to  the \nUNFCCC. This document estimated that the project can potentially save about 600,000 tons of \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) per year based on a comparison of CO2 emissions by the project with the \nsystem-average CO2 emission factor.  \n \nLink to ADB strategy and sector road map. ADB's strategy in Viet Nam is to develop \n9. \ninfrastructure essential for promoting economic growth and enabling private sector investments. \nADB\u2019s energy policy emphasizes increased access to electricity for all, and production and use \nof clean energy. The output of this project will be  a power generation plant that produces less \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helps  meet  electricity  demand  in  a  more  reliable  and \nenvironmentally benign manner. Thus it is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy.  \n \n10. \nThe energy sector assessment strategy and road map identified several areas for future \ndevelopment  and  cooperation  with  ADB  and  other  development  partners:5 (i)  optimal  use  of \ndomestic  energy  resources  (natural  gas,  hydro,  coal)  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  energy  needs, \nthereby  improving  energy  security;  (ii)  increase  use  of  renewable  energy,  and  promotion  of \nenergy  conservation  and  efficiency  for  energy  security;  (iii)  continue  sector  reforms  and \nrestructuring  to  enable  more  competition  in  generation,  transmission  and  distribution;  (iv) \nmobilizing  cofinancing  for  meeting  investment  requirements  and  promoting  clean  energy \ntechnologies in the energy sector; and (v) regional cooperation. Hence, the project is also in line \nwith the energy sector assessment. \n \n\n                                                \n4  O Mon I (two 300 MW plants) is being financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The first 300 MW \nsimple cycle plant was completed in 2009, while bidding is ongoing for the second plant. The 750 MW O Mon II will \nbe bid out for competitive tender to the private sector. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is assisting the \nMinistry of Industry and Trade in preparing the bidding documents and bidding of this plant. The 750 MW O Mon III \nwill be developed by EVN with funding from Japan. \n\n5  Energy Sector Assessment Strategy and Road Map (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f 11.  ADB and development partner coordination.  ADB plays a leading role in (i) physical \ninfrastructure development for the generation and transmission system, (ii) promotion of energy \nefficiency  and  conservation,  (iii)  regional  power  interconnections,  (iv)  promotion  of  private \nsector, and (v) sector reforms and power market development together with other development \npartners.6 The World Bank is active in distribution network, and rural electrification, while Japan \nprovides  assistance  to  generation,  transmission,  and  in  preparing  power  development  plans. \nOther partners have focused their assistance on policies and regulatory framework in renewable \nenergy,  energy  efficiency,  environmental  protection,  and  climate  change.  ADB  and  the \ndevelopment  partners  regularly  exchange  information  on  their  planned  activities  in  the  energy \nsector so as not to duplicate assistance but to complement each other\u2019s efforts in the sector. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  sector  experience. To date,  ADB  has  provided  six  sovereign loans to  the  Viet \nNam  power  sector  amounting  to  $1,719  million,  and  two  private  sector  loans for  two  gas-fired \nplants at Phu My, amounting to $90 million with associated guarantees of $60 million. Advisory \ntechnical  assistances  built  capacity  to  address  project  implementation,  safeguards,  sector \nregulations, and power sector reforms. ADB\u2019s program of support to Viet Nam\u2019s power sector is \nconsidered  to  be  highly  relevant 7 to  the  country\u2019s  development  goals  as  it  was  focused  on \npriorities within the sector at the time the loans were made. Similarly, the technical assistance \nprogram  was  fully  supportive  of  the  program  of  sector  reforms  advocated  by  both  the \ngovernment  and  development  partners. With  ADB  assistance,8 the  road  map  for  power  sector \nreform  commenced  in  2004  that  led  to  the  Electricity  Law  being  promulgated  in  2005  and \nestablishment  of  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  in  2006.  Further,  in  2008  the  Master  Plan  for \nrestructuring  the  power  sector  by  separating  the  generation,  load  dispatch,  transmission  and \ndistribution functions, and establishing separate entities to perform these different functions was \napproved  for  implementation.  ADB  continues  to  actively  engage  in  policy  dialogue  and  assist \nViet Nam in moving the sector reform program forward. \n \n13. \nLessons  learned.  Given  ADB\u2019s  sector  experience,  lessons  learned  highlight  the \nimportance of (i) ensuring a proper balance between transmission and generation investments \nin  programming;  (ii)  securing  cofinancing;  (iii)  advancing  recruitment  to  avoid  start-up  delays; \nand  (iv)  limiting  contract  packages  to  reduce  transaction  costs.  This  project  enhances \ngeneration  capacity, \nthe  project \nimplementation consultant to avoid start-up delays.  \n \nB. \n\nincludes  cofinancing,  and  advanced \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nrecruitment  of \n\nThe  impact  will  be  a  more  reliable  supply  of  electricity  to  industrial,  commercial,  and \n14. \nresidential  consumers  to  enable  socioeconomic  development  and  industrialization,  particularly \nin southern Viet Nam and the Mekong Delta. \n \nThe outcome will be adequate generating capacity of the Viet Nam power system with a \n15. \nmore balanced capacity mix and sufficient system reserve margin to meet the growing electricity \ndemand, particularly in southern Viet Nam and the Mekong Delta. \n \n\n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n7   ADB. 2009.

The  procurement  of  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  with \ncertain  agreed  modifications  and  waivers.  Considering  the  joint  nature  of  financing  between \nADB and KfW, it is proposed to allow the procurement of civil works, goods, and services from \ncountries  that  are  not  ADB  members.  For  this  to  happen,  a  waiver  from  ADB\u2019s  eligibility \nprovision is necessary and is being sought for this project. In the absence of a waiver on country \nand source eligibility, implementation of the project as a cofinanced project will not be possible.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n23. \nEconomic  analysis. The economic viability of the project was examined by comparing \nthe  societal  costs  and  benefits  of  the  \u2015with-project\u2016  scenario  against  the  \u2015without-project\u2016 \nscenario. The costs to the society include investment and operating costs of the project, as well \nas  environmental  mitigating  costs.  Investment  costs  in  turn  include  equipment,  construction, \nconsulting  services,  and  project  administration  and  management.  The  project  costs  take  into \naccount physical contingencies, but exclude price contingences and taxes and duties. \n \nThe  economic  value  of  electricity  generated  by  the  project  is  measured  by  using  the \n24. \ncosts  to  the  society  of  not  having  this  project  (the  so-called  avoided  costs).  The  project  will \ngenerate  4,388  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  electricity  for  sale  every  year.11 This  is  the  benefit  in \nphysical terms compared with the without-project situation.  \n \n25. \nThe economic value of the project is a sum of the benefits resulting from (i) not having to \nuse  reserve  capacity  for  full  utilization,  which  is  expensive  because  of  the  high  cost  of \ngenerating  electricity  using  fuel  oil;  (ii)  not  having  to  run  diesel  generators  for  industrial  and \nbusiness enterprises; and (iii) not having to suffer from power blackout for small business and \nhouseholds.  The  benefit  attributable  to  not  having  to  use  reserve  capacity  is  equivalent  to \navoided  costs  and  considered  non-incremental.  For  industrial  and  commercial  consumers,  the \nbenefits have two components: benefits to existing consumers (non-incremental) and benefits to \nnew  consumers  (incremental).  Non-incremental benefits  are  valued  at  avoided  costs  (e.g.,  not \nhaving  to  run  backup  generators),  whereas  incremental  benefits  are  valued  at  average \nelectricity tariff (e.g., revenues). \n \n\n                                                \n11 Corresponding to 6,000 hours full load per year. EVN confirmed this load factor based on the dispatching condition \nof  the  entire  system  (e.g.,  during  rainy  season,  large  hydropower  plants  will  run  at  base  load,  leaving  CCGT  to \ncover mid-level load). Other CCGT power plants in operation have similar load factors.  \n\n \n\n\fA  detailed  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  project  is  economically  robust  under  various \n26. \nsensitivity  conditions.  The  project  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  27%  and  a  net \npresent value over 25 years of more than $481 million.12 \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The financial  analysis  for the project  was carried  out  in real  terms \n27. \nusing 2010 prices. The weighted average cost of capital, which represents the cost incurred by \nEVN in raising the capital necessary to implement the project, is estimated to be 2.6% (after tax \nand in real terms). The after-tax net present value (discounted at the after-tax weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  2.6%)  is  $217.3  million.  The  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the \nproject  is  estimated  at  5.2%,  which  is  double  the  minimum  required  rate  of  2.6%.  Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out for the main input variable, which confirmed the financial viability of the \nproject.13  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith  the  government,  EVN,  and  CTTP.  The  specific  measures  introduced  to  enhance \ngovernance  and  minimize  procurement-related  risks  include  the  requirement  for  EVN\u2019s \ninspectorate  department  to  (i)  closely  supervise  the  bidding  processes,  bid  evaluation,  and \nconstruction; (ii) prevent interference in the bidding and evaluation process; and (iii) brief CTTP \nand the related government authorities, including the local prosecutor\u2019s office, when an incident \nof corruption has been detected. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe  project  is  in  Can  Tho  province  in  the  Mekong  Delta.  The  project  will  contribute  to \neconomic and industrial growth, which will create jobs in various sectors and help to improve the \nquality of living in the Mekong Delta. Women will be among the beneficiaries of the increase in \njobs. Women  entrepreneurs  will  have access to  an  adequate  supply  of  electricity,  which could \nresult in higher incomes and more women entrepreneurs in the Mekong Delta. In addition, the \nreliable  supply  of  electricity  will  encourage  the  use  of  electrical  appliances  and  reduce  the \ndrudgery of the work performed by women.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  classified  as  category  A.  EVN  prepared  a \n\nfull \n30. \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), which ADB approved. The EIA was disclosed publicly \non  the  ADB  website  on  22  October  2010  to  comply  with  the  requirement  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) for public disclosure of 120 days.14 The EIA identified potential impacts \ncaused  by  the  project  during  construction  and  operation,  and  devised  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) that includes measures to mitigate these impacts.  \n \n31. \nPlant  operation  involves  the  release  of  warm  water  into  the  Hau  River  and  stack \nemissions  such  as  particulate  matters,  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2),  and  CO2  into  the  atmosphere. \nThe EIA looked at the cumulative effects of these impacts on the environment. The impacts of \nthe  warm  water  released  into  Hau  River  and  the  air  pollution  were  examined  for  the  entire  O \nMon complex. With regard to the warm water release, the EIA found an insignificant possibility \n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthat  the  temperature  of  the  discharged  water  at  the  outlet  would  exceed  Viet  Nam\u2019s  standard \nguidelines. Applying international best practice, which involves looking at the increase in water \ntemperature  inside  the  mixing  zone,  the  thermal  plume  is  not  expected  to  have  a  significant \nimpact on aquatic ecology.  \n \n32. \nThe  EIA  carried  out  comprehensive  air  quality  modeling  to  forecast  the  potential \ncumulative  impacts  of  air  pollution.  Following  standard  international  air  quality  modeling \npractice, the EIA found that the air pollution from the O Mon power complex was not expected to \nexceed Viet Nam\u2019s environment, health, and safety guidelines. With the addition of background \nconcentrations,  potential  exceedance  of  the  1-hour  NO2 guidelines  is  predicted  at  2  hours  per \nyear  from  the  power  complex;  hence,  the  air  quality  risk  is  not  considered  significant. \nNevertheless,  the  EMP  includes  a  continuous  ambient  monitoring  program  that  will  be \nimplemented  to  verify  and  validate  the  modeling,  and  to  identify  periods  of  adverse  air  quality \nthat require additional management measures, as necessary.  \n \n33. \nThe  comprehensive  EMP  includes  (i)  mitigation  measures  for  the  construction  and \noperation phases, (ii) a rigorous environmental monitoring and reporting plan, (iii) independent \nverification  of  the  monitoring  results,  and  (iv)  clear  delineation  of  responsibilities  between  the \nEPC contractor and CTTP. With a 15% contingency, the total EMP budget is close to $700,000. \nThe costs for many of the EMP mitigation measures, such as the use of a low NO2 burner and \nthe  treatment  of  all  wastewater,  are  not  included  in  the  EMP  budget  because  they  are  in  the \nEPC package cost estimate and/or operating cost estimates. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous people. CTTP acquired the entire land area for the \nO Mon power complex before ADB loan processing. Resettlement for O Mon III, O Mon IV, the \nland  area  reserved  for  construction  work,  the  access  road  (Road  No.  2),  and  the  second \ndischarge channel was completed in 2006. A total of 95.5 hectares were acquired, affecting 601 \nfor \nhouseholds, \ncompensation and resettlement. \n \n35. \nAs land acquisition was completed in 2006, the project team undertook due diligence of \nthe  resettlement  process  done  by  EVN  and  local  authorities  in  2006  as  the  basis  for  project \nappraisal. Due diligence, conducted in March 2010\u2013September 2010, covered (i) the review of \nall  project  files  related  to  affected  property  and  compensation  payments  provided  by  EVN; \n(ii) interviews  with  key  stakeholders  (village  chiefs,  O  Mon  resettlement  committee  members, \nand  CTTP  personnel  responsible  for  land  acquisition);  and  (iii)  household  surveys.  The  due \ndiligence found that the resettlement process carried out by EVN in 2006 had been completed in \na manner that generally complied with key aspects of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, such \nas eligibility, entitlement, and compensation for productive and residential lands and residential \nstructures; resettlement assistance; and assistance for vulnerable households. However, some \nminor  additional  works  necessary  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  were  also  identified.  These  additional  required  tasks  have  been  included  in  a \ncorrective action plan that ADB, EVN, and CTTP have agreed upon.15  \n \n36. \nThe  corrective  action  plan  focuses  on  (i)  confirming  that  there  are  no  outstanding \ngrievances, (ii) improving assistance to vulnerable households, and (iii) providing jobs to project-\naffected  people.  In  addition,  actions  were  also  agreed  on  to  comply  with  social  protection \nrequirements. These actions and their timing are described in para. 70 of the PAM. \n\nthat  required  relocation.  CTTP  has  paid  D110  billion \n\nincluding  226 \n\n                                                \n15 Resettlement Plan: Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n37. \nPublic  consultation  and  disclosure.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure  has  been \nundertaken  appropriately.  Public  involvement  in  the  planning  and  design  of  the  O  Mon  power \ncomplex  started  in  2000  with  the  compensation  and  resettlement  process  of  O  Mon  I  and  II. \nConsultation on the remaining power plants, including O Mon IV, started in 2005. In November \n2007,  the  EIA  report,  prepared  in  Vietnamese  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  was  disclosed  to  the  An  Thoi  and  Phuoc  Thoi  people\u2019s \ncommittees  and  Vietnamese  Fatherland  Front.  Two  environmental  and  social  public \nconsultations  were  also  organized  in  2007:  (i)  public  consultation  meetings  21\u201322  July  in  An \nThoi and Phuoc Thoi wards, and (ii) a stakeholder workshop at the O Mon power complex on 14 \nSeptember.   \n \nA  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  developed  to  provide  a  systematic, \n38. \ntransparent,  and  timely  process  for  receiving,  evaluating,  and  addressing  project-related \ncomplaints  and  grievances  of  affected  people.  This  mechanism  is  open  to  all  affected  people \nregardless of the nature of their complaint and can be filed with up to three levels of authority: O \nMon  district  people\u2019s  committee,  Can  Tho  city  people\u2019s  committee,  and  Can  Tho  city  people\u2019s \ncourt of justice.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n \nThe project is part of a larger gas supply consumption chain, which consists of offshore \n40. \ngas production at Block B/52, gas transportation from Block B/52 to the O Mon power complex, \nand the use of gas for power generation. As such, the project outcome and impact depend on \nthe  timely  and  successful  implementation  of  the  upstream  supply  chains.  A  consortium  led  by \nChevron has finished the front-end engineering design for the offshore production platform and \nhas been determined sufficient gas for all power plants at the O Mon complex. A consortium led \nby PVN has finished the front-end engineering design for the gas pipeline and has commences \nconstruction of the gas pipeline. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nCost overrun of EPC package \n\nRisks \n\nProcurement delay of the EPC package \n\nDelay  in  construction  of  the  gas  pipeline  to \nthe O Mon power complex \n\nMitigating Measures \nA higher physical contingency for the EPC package has been applied \n(15%  instead  of  8%).    If  bids  result  in  higher-than-estimated  costs, \nthis physical contingency amount will be mobilized.  \n\nAdvance recruitment of implementation consultants has been initiated \nand contract to be awarded in Jan 2012.
