I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the O Mon IV Combined Cycle Power Plant Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will construct a 750-megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) \npower plant at the O Mon thermal power complex. The project is in O Mon district in the city of \nCan Tho, about 250 kilometers south of Ho Chi Minh City.2 The project will help Viet Nam meet \nthe  fast-growing  demand  for  electricity  to  foster  socioeconomic  development  and \nindustrialization in the south, particularly in the Mekong Delta. The project is part of the least-\ncost Seventh Master Power Development Plan approved by the Government of Viet Nam in \n2011. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Meeting  the  demand.  Strong  economic  growth  (about  8%  a  year  during  the  past \ndecade), rapid industrialization, an expansion of business and services, coupled with rising \nhousehold consumptions have been the causes of the electricity demand growth. Electricity \nconsumption grew at an annual average of 15% per year in 2000\u20132009 and accelerated to 18% \nin 2010. Electricity demand is projected to continue to grow rapidly: 13% per year in 2011\u20132015, \n11% per year in 2015\u20132020, and 9% per year in 2020\u20132025 according to the Seventh Master \nPower Development Plan. From 1995 to 2009, household access to electricity increased from \n50% to more than 94%, and per capita electricity consumption rose during the same period from \n156 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to about 900 kWh. Rapid economic growth has helped Viet Nam \nreduce the share of the population below the poverty line from 58% in 1993 to 13% in 2009. \n \n4.  To meet this rapidly growing demand for electricity, the government plans to increase \ngenerating capacity by maximizing use of the country\u2019s energy resources.  Despite construction \nof new generating capacity, power shortage still occurs in the country as electricity demand still \noutstrips supply3. To address this deficit and improve the quality and reliability of the electricity \nsupply to consumers, the government plans to increase generating capacity from 18,481 MW in \n2010 to 35,000 MW in 2015 and 60,000 MW in 2020.  \n \n5.  In the south, where natural gas is available, several gas-based power complexes have \nbeen built, including Phu My (4,000 MW), Nhon Trach (1,500 MW), and Ca Mau (1,500 MW). A \nconsortium comprising Chevron and the PetroVietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN) is developing \nBlock B/52 in the Gulf of Thailand and transporting the natural gas to the O Mon power complex \nfor electricity generation. The O Mon IV power plant is one of the four power plants to be \ndeveloped at the complex to meet the growing demand for electricity in southern Viet Nam.  \n \n6.  Meeting  investment  requirements.  To  build  a  sufficient  power  system  (including \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution), Viet Nam must mobilize about $44 billion for 2010\u2013\n2015, of which about $27 billion will be invested in new generation facilities and $17 billion in \ntransmission and distribution facilities. Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) is expected to mobilize \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Support for Public\u2013Private Development of the \nO Mon Thermal Power Complex Project. Manila (TA 4845-VIE). \n3  Electricity of Viet Nam reported that in April\u2013June 2010 the power shortage was more than 500 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh). \n ", "2 \n$32.7 billion. The balance of $11.3 billion will come from non-EVN domestic and international \ninvestors.  The  financing  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  O Mon  IV  is \nessential for EVN and the government to meet its investment requirement. \n \n7.  Public\u2013private partnership. The private sector already plays a significant role in power \ngeneration.  Of  the  18,481  MW  of  installed  generating  capacity,  EVN  accounts  for  66%, \nindependent power producers 24%, and BOT projects 10%. The government has adopted a \nunique public\u2013private partnership (PPP) approach where a power complex hosts both an EVN \npower plant and a privately owned power plant. The project site and its common facilities are \ndeveloped by EVN with public financing. ADB has provided such financing to a number of PPP \nprojects, for example, the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project, the Phu My 2.2, and Phu My 3 \ngas-fired combined cycle power projects. This approach creates incentives for private sector in \nutilizing the common facilities provided by EVN. A similar approach is being used at the O Mon \npower complex, where EVN invests in O Mon IV and invites private investors to invest in O Mon \nII.4 ADB in helping EVN finance O Mon IV and the government in bidding out O Mon II, is \nfacilitating PPP for the development of the O Mon power complex. \n \n8.  Promoting state of the art technology. ADB's assistance to the O Mon power complex \nis not limited to financing O Mon IV. ADB financed and coordinated a number of studies that \ndemonstrated various gas supply\u2014consumption scenarios and related gas pricing. The O Mon \ncomplex (3,600 MW) will generate electricity using gas, a cleaner fuel than coal alternative. As \nCCGT is an eligible technology for consideration under the Clean Development Mechanism of \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ADB technical \nsupport facility assisted EVN in preparing the project design document for submission to the \nUNFCCC. This document estimated that the project can potentially save about 600,000 tons of \ncarbon dioxide (CO ) per year based on a comparison of CO  emissions by the project with the \n2 2\nsystem-average CO  emission factor.  \n2\n \n9.  Link to ADB strategy and sector road map. ADB's strategy in Viet Nam is to develop \ninfrastructure essential for promoting economic growth and enabling private sector investments. \nADB\u2019s energy policy emphasizes increased access to electricity for all, and production and use \nof clean energy. The output of this project will be a power generation plant that produces less \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helps  meet  electricity  demand  in  a  more  reliable  and \nenvironmentally benign manner. Thus it is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy.  \n \n10.  The energy sector assessment strategy and road map identified several areas for future \ndevelopment and cooperation with ADB and other development partners:5 (i) optimal use of \ndomestic energy resources (natural gas, hydro, coal) to meet the country\u2019s energy needs, \nthereby improving energy security; (ii) increase use of renewable energy, and promotion of \nenergy  conservation  and  efficiency  for  energy  security;  (iii)  continue  sector  reforms  and \nrestructuring  to  enable  more  competition  in  generation,  transmission  and  distribution;  (iv) \nmobilizing  cofinancing  for  meeting  investment  requirements  and  promoting  clean  energy \ntechnologies in the energy sector; and (v) regional cooperation. Hence, the project is also in line \nwith the energy sector assessment. \n \n                                                \n4  O Mon I (two 300 MW plants) is being financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The first 300 MW \nsimple cycle plant was completed in 2009, while bidding is ongoing for the second plant. The 750 MW O Mon II will \nbe bid out for competitive tender to the private sector. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is assisting the \nMinistry of Industry and Trade in preparing the bidding documents and bidding of this plant. The 750 MW O Mon III \nwill be developed by EVN with funding from Japan. \n5  Energy Sector Assessment Strategy and Road Map (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n 11.  ADB and development partner coordination.  ADB plays a leading role in (i) physical \ninfrastructure development for the generation and transmission system, (ii) promotion of energy \nefficiency  and  conservation,  (iii)  regional  power  interconnections,  (iv)  promotion  of  private \nsector, and (v) sector reforms and power market development together with other development \npartners.6 The World Bank is active in distribution network, and rural electrification, while Japan \nprovides assistance to generation, transmission, and in preparing power development plans. \nOther partners have focused their assistance on policies and regulatory framework in renewable \nenergy,  energy  efficiency,  environmental  protection,  and  climate  change.  ADB  and  the \ndevelopment partners regularly exchange information on their planned activities in the energy \nsector so as not to duplicate assistance but to complement each other\u2019s efforts in the sector. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s sector experience. To date, ADB has provided six sovereign loans to the Viet \nNam power sector amounting to $1,719 million, and two private sector loans for two gas-fired \nplants at Phu My, amounting to $90 million with associated guarantees of $60 million. Advisory \ntechnical  assistances  built  capacity  to  address  project  implementation,  safeguards,  sector \nregulations, and power sector reforms. ADB\u2019s program of support to Viet Nam\u2019s power sector is \nconsidered to be highly relevant7 to the country\u2019s development goals as it was focused on \npriorities within the sector at the time the loans were made. Similarly, the technical assistance \nprogram  was  fully  supportive  of  the  program  of  sector  reforms  advocated  by  both  the \ngovernment and development partners. With ADB assistance,8 the road map for power sector \nreform commenced in 2004 that led to the Electricity Law being promulgated in 2005 and \nestablishment of Electricity Regulatory Authority in 2006. Further, in 2008 the Master Plan for \nrestructuring the power sector by separating the generation, load dispatch, transmission and \ndistribution functions, and establishing separate entities to perform these different functions was \napproved for implementation. ADB continues to actively engage in policy dialogue and assist \nViet Nam in moving the sector reform program forward. \n \n13.  Lessons  learned.  Given  ADB\u2019s  sector  experience,  lessons  learned  highlight  the \nimportance of (i) ensuring a proper balance between transmission and generation investments \nin programming; (ii) securing cofinancing; (iii) advancing recruitment to avoid start-up delays; \nand  (iv)  limiting  contract  packages  to  reduce  transaction  costs.  This  project  enhances \ngeneration  capacity,  includes  cofinancing,  and  advanced  recruitment  of  the  project \nimplementation consultant to avoid start-up delays.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be a more reliable supply of electricity to industrial, commercial, and \nresidential consumers to enable socioeconomic development and industrialization, particularly \nin southern Viet Nam and the Mekong Delta. \n \n15.  The outcome will be adequate generating capacity of the Viet Nam power system with a \nmore balanced capacity mix and sufficient system reserve margin to meet the growing electricity \ndemand, particularly in southern Viet Nam and the Mekong Delta. \n \n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n7  ADB. 2009.

The outputs will be (i) a 750 MW CCGT power plant with net plant efficiency of greater \nthan 55%, situated at the O Mon power complex in O Mon district in the city of Can Tho; and (ii) \na set of common facilities to be used by the O Mon IV and O Mon III power plants including an \naccess road, an administration building, a 500-kilovolt switchyard, a circulating water intake \ntower and pump station, a discharge tunnel and discharge canal, and a firefighting system.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $793.45 million (Table 1).  \n \n18.  The government has requested a loan of $309.89 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) to help finance the project.9 The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of five years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nthe interest and other charges during construction as applicable to be capitalized in the loan, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese choices were made on its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The government will relend the funds to EVN. EVN will \nbear the exchange rate and interest risks. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem   Amount \nA.  Base Costa   \n  1.

Procurement. The procurement of civil works financed by ADB will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) with \ncertain agreed modifications and waivers. Considering the joint nature of financing between \nADB and KfW, it is proposed to allow the procurement of civil works, goods, and services from \ncountries  that  are  not  ADB  members.  For  this  to  happen,  a  waiver  from  ADB\u2019s  eligibility \nprovision is necessary and is being sought for this project. In the absence of a waiver on country \nand source eligibility, implementation of the project as a cofinanced project will not be possible.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n23.  Economic analysis. The economic viability of the project was examined by comparing \nthe  societal  costs  and  benefits  of  the  \u2015with-project\u2016  scenario  against  the  \u2015without-project\u2016 \nscenario. The costs to the society include investment and operating costs of the project, as well \nas environmental mitigating costs. Investment costs in turn include equipment, construction, \nconsulting services, and project administration and management. The project costs take into \naccount physical contingencies, but exclude price contingences and taxes and duties. \n \n24.  The economic value of electricity generated by the project is measured by using the \ncosts to the society of not having this project (the so-called avoided costs). The project will \ngenerate 4,388 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity for sale every year.11 This is the benefit in \nphysical terms compared with the without-project situation.  \n \n25.  The economic value of the project is a sum of the benefits resulting from (i) not having to \nuse  reserve  capacity  for  full  utilization,  which  is  expensive  because  of  the  high  cost  of \ngenerating electricity using fuel oil; (ii) not having to run diesel generators for industrial and \nbusiness enterprises; and (iii) not having to suffer from power blackout for small business and \nhouseholds. The benefit attributable to not having to use reserve capacity is equivalent to \navoided costs and considered non-incremental. For industrial and commercial consumers, the \nbenefits have two components: benefits to existing consumers (non-incremental) and benefits to \nnew consumers (incremental). Non-incremental benefits are valued at avoided costs (e.g., not \nhaving  to  run  backup  generators),  whereas  incremental  benefits  are  valued  at  average \nelectricity tariff (e.g., revenues). \n \n                                                \n11 Corresponding to 6,000 hours full load per year. EVN confirmed this load factor based on the dispatching condition \nof the entire system (e.g., during rainy season, large hydropower plants will run at base load, leaving CCGT to \ncover mid-level load). Other CCGT power plants in operation have similar load factors.  \n ", "7 \n26.  A detailed analysis demonstrates that the project is economically robust under various \nsensitivity conditions. The project yields an economic internal rate of return of 27% and a net \npresent value over 25 years of more than $481 million.12 \n \n27.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis for the project was carried out in real terms \nusing 2010 prices. The weighted average cost of capital, which represents the cost incurred by \nEVN in raising the capital necessary to implement the project, is estimated to be 2.6% (after tax \nand in real terms). The after-tax net present value (discounted at the after-tax weighted average \ncost of capital of 2.6%) is $217.3 million. The after-tax financial internal rate of return of the \nproject is estimated at 5.2%, which is double the minimum required rate of 2.6%. Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out for the main input variable, which confirmed the financial viability of the \nproject.13  \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  EVN,  and  CTTP.  The  specific  measures  introduced  to  enhance \ngovernance  and  minimize  procurement-related  risks  include  the  requirement  for  EVN\u2019s \ninspectorate department to (i) closely supervise the bidding processes, bid evaluation, and \nconstruction; (ii) prevent interference in the bidding and evaluation process; and (iii) brief CTTP \nand the related government authorities, including the local prosecutor\u2019s office, when an incident \nof corruption has been detected. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project is in Can Tho province in the Mekong Delta. The project will contribute to \neconomic and industrial growth, which will create jobs in various sectors and help to improve the \nquality of living in the Mekong Delta. Women will be among the beneficiaries of the increase in \njobs. Women entrepreneurs will have access to an adequate supply of electricity, which could \nresult in higher incomes and more women entrepreneurs in the Mekong Delta. In addition, the \nreliable supply of electricity will encourage the use of electrical appliances and reduce the \ndrudgery of the work performed by women.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A.  EVN  prepared  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), which ADB approved. The EIA was disclosed publicly \non the ADB website on 22 October 2010 to comply with the requirement in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) for public disclosure of 120 days.14 The EIA identified potential impacts \ncaused  by  the  project  during  construction  and  operation,  and  devised  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) that includes measures to mitigate these impacts.  \n \n31.  Plant  operation  involves  the  release  of  warm  water  into  the  Hau  River  and  stack \nemissions such as particulate matters, nitrogen dioxide (NO ), and CO  into the atmosphere. \n2 2\nThe EIA looked at the cumulative effects of these impacts on the environment. The impacts of \nthe warm water released into Hau River and the air pollution were examined for the entire O \nMon complex. With regard to the warm water release, the EIA found an insignificant possibility \n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nthat the temperature of the discharged water at the outlet would exceed Viet Nam\u2019s standard \nguidelines. Applying international best practice, which involves looking at the increase in water \ntemperature inside the mixing zone, the thermal plume is not expected to have a significant \nimpact on aquatic ecology.  \n \n32.  The  EIA  carried  out  comprehensive  air  quality  modeling  to  forecast  the  potential \ncumulative  impacts  of  air  pollution.  Following  standard  international  air  quality  modeling \npractice, the EIA found that the air pollution from the O Mon power complex was not expected to \nexceed Viet Nam\u2019s environment, health, and safety guidelines. With the addition of background \nconcentrations, potential exceedance of the 1-hour NO  guidelines is predicted at 2 hours per \n2\nyear  from  the  power  complex;  hence,  the  air  quality  risk  is  not  considered  significant. \nNevertheless,  the  EMP  includes  a  continuous  ambient  monitoring  program  that  will  be \nimplemented to verify and validate the modeling, and to identify periods of adverse air quality \nthat require additional management measures, as necessary.  \n \n33.  The  comprehensive  EMP  includes  (i)  mitigation  measures  for  the  construction  and \noperation phases, (ii) a rigorous environmental monitoring and reporting plan, (iii) independent \nverification of the monitoring results, and (iv) clear delineation of responsibilities between the \nEPC contractor and CTTP. With a 15% contingency, the total EMP budget is close to $700,000. \nThe costs for many of the EMP mitigation measures, such as the use of a low NO  burner and \n2\nthe treatment of all wastewater, are not included in the EMP budget because they are in the \nEPC package cost estimate and/or operating cost estimates. \n \n34.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous people. CTTP acquired the entire land area for the \nO Mon power complex before ADB loan processing. Resettlement for O Mon III, O Mon IV, the \nland area reserved for construction work, the access road (Road No. 2), and the second \ndischarge channel was completed in 2006. A total of 95.5 hectares were acquired, affecting 601 \nhouseholds,  including  226  that  required  relocation.  CTTP  has  paid  D110  billion  for \ncompensation and resettlement. \n \n35.  As land acquisition was completed in 2006, the project team undertook due diligence of \nthe resettlement process done by EVN and local authorities in 2006 as the basis for project \nappraisal. Due diligence, conducted in March 2010\u2013September 2010, covered (i) the review of \nall project files related to affected property and compensation payments provided by  EVN; \n(ii) interviews with key stakeholders (village chiefs, O Mon resettlement committee members, \nand CTTP personnel responsible for land acquisition); and (iii) household surveys. The due \ndiligence found that the resettlement process carried out by EVN in 2006 had been completed in \na manner that generally complied with key aspects of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, such \nas eligibility, entitlement, and compensation for productive and residential lands and residential \nstructures; resettlement assistance; and assistance for vulnerable households. However, some \nminor  additional  works  necessary  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  were  also  identified.  These  additional  required  tasks  have  been  included  in  a \ncorrective action plan that ADB, EVN, and CTTP have agreed upon.15  \n \n36.  The  corrective  action  plan  focuses  on  (i)  confirming  that  there  are  no  outstanding \ngrievances, (ii) improving assistance to vulnerable households, and (iii) providing jobs to project-\naffected people. In addition, actions  were also agreed  on to comply with social protection \nrequirements. These actions and their timing are described in para. 70 of the PAM. \n                                                \n15 Resettlement Plan: Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \n37.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure.  Public  consultation  and  disclosure  has  been \nundertaken appropriately. Public involvement in the planning and design of the O Mon power \ncomplex started in 2000 with the compensation and resettlement process of O Mon I and II. \nConsultation on the remaining power plants, including O Mon IV, started in 2005. In November \n2007,  the  EIA  report,  prepared  in  Vietnamese  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  was  disclosed  to  the  An  Thoi  and  Phuoc  Thoi  people\u2019s \ncommittees  and  Vietnamese  Fatherland  Front.  Two  environmental  and  social  public \nconsultations were also organized in 2007: (i) public consultation meetings 21\u201322 July in An \nThoi and Phuoc Thoi wards, and (ii) a stakeholder workshop at the O Mon power complex on 14 \nSeptember.   \n \n38.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  developed  to  provide  a  systematic, \ntransparent,  and  timely  process  for  receiving,  evaluating,  and  addressing  project-related \ncomplaints and grievances of affected people. This mechanism is open to all affected people \nregardless of the nature of their complaint and can be filed with up to three levels of authority: O \nMon district people\u2019s committee, Can Tho city people\u2019s committee, and Can Tho city people\u2019s \ncourt of justice.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n \n40.  The project is part of a larger gas supply consumption chain, which consists of offshore \ngas production at Block B/52, gas transportation from Block B/52 to the O Mon power complex, \nand the use of gas for power generation. As such, the project outcome and impact depend on \nthe timely and successful implementation of the upstream supply chains. A consortium led by \nChevron has finished the front-end engineering design for the offshore production platform and \nhas been determined sufficient gas for all power plants at the O Mon complex. A consortium led \nby PVN has finished the front-end engineering design for the gas pipeline and has commences \nconstruction of the gas pipeline. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCost overrun of EPC package  A higher physical contingency for the EPC package has been applied \n(15% instead of 8%).

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The government and EVN have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and EVN have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n42.  In  addition  to  the  assurances,  the  loan  agreement  will  be  made  effective  upon  (i) \napproval of the KfW loan by the relevant approving authorities of KfW; and (ii) the duly executed \nand delivery of the subsidiary loan agreement on behalf of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nand EVN.  \n \n43.  The withdrawal of loan proceeds will be subject to: (i) the KfW loan agreement being \nduly executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than a \ncondition requiring the effectiveness of the ADB loan agreement shall have been fulfilled) or \narrangements satisfactory to ADB shall have been made for the fulfillment thereof within a \nperiod  of  time  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  (ii)  the  signing  of  the  gas  supply  and  purchase \nagreement between EVN and PVN. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $309,890,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the O Mon IV \nCombined Cycle Power Plant Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft  loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the proposal set out in para. 22 of this report to allow civil works, goods, and \nservices from nonmember countries of ADB to be eligible for financing under the \nO Mon IV Combined Cycle Power Plant Project by the requisite affirmative votes \nof Directors representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of \nADB\u2019s members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing the \nADB.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n2 November 2011\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Risks \nReliable supply of  Planned (forced) load  Statistics of National  Insufficient investments in \nelectricity to the  shedding in the Mekong  Dispatching Center  other generation project \nindustrial, commercial,  Delta reduced from 1%  and in transmission and \nand residential  of demand in 2011 to  distribution system \nconsumers,  0.45% of the demand by \nDelay in the \nparticularly in  2018 \nimplementation of the gas \nsouthern Viet Nam \npipeline project, which \nsupplies gas to the O Mon \npower complex \nOutcome      Risk \nAdequate generating  750 MW CCGT  EVN annual reports  Insufficient resources and \ncapacity of the Viet  generating capacity  funds for sustainable \nNam power system  added to the system in  operation and maintenance \n2016  of the power plant \nAt least 4,388 GWh of \nelectricity added to the \nsupply starting 2016 \nSystem reserve margin \n(e.g., the difference \nbetween system \ncapacity and demand \nload) not below 15% \nfrom 2016 onward \nOutputs      Risks \n1.CCGT O Mon IV  750 MW CCGT power  EVN progress reports  Cost overrun and \npower plant  plant constructed,  procurement delay \nProject review by ADB \noperational  tested, and \nand EVN  Changes of personnel and \ncommissioned by June \n2.
