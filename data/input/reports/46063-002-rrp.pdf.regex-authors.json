THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xinjiang Tacheng Border Cities and Counties \nDevelopment Project.1  \n \n2.  By meeting urgent needs in urban infrastructure and municipal services, the project will \nimprove the environment, social inclusiveness, and border trade capacity of Tacheng City and \nthe county cities of Emin, Tuoli, and Yumin. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Located in the northwest of the PRC, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is a \nborder area linking the PRC to Central Asia. It covers almost one-sixth of the country\u2019s total \narea. In 2013, its population was about 22.65 million,2 60.5% of which comprises 36 ethnic \nminority groups.3 XUAR has lagged behind in economic development and remains one of the \npoorest and least-developed regions in the PRC. In 2013, XUAR\u2019s per capita disposable income \nof  urban  households  was  CNY19,874,  which  was  the  second  lowest  among  all  the  PRC \nprovinces and autonomous regions. 4 Such wide disparities prompted the Government of the \nPRC to launch the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region in 2000, with the \naim to promote balanced economic growth and to raise the living standards in the region. 5 \n4.  Tacheng Prefecture is in the northwest of XUAR and shares a 480 kilometer (km)-long \nborder with Kazakhstan. Due to its strategic geographical location along the economic corridors \nof  the  New  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt,  border  trade  is  playing  an  increasing  role  in  local \neconomic development, which is based mainly on the rich agricultural and mineral resources of \nthe prefecture. 6 To promote border trade development, the central government is cooperating \nwith the regional and local authorities to build rail and road networks, upgrade key urban \ninfrastructure and land port facilities, and support the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises and the introduction of trade facilitation initiatives.7 These investments will provide a \nbig opportunity for Tacheng City and neighboring counties such as Emin, Tuoli, and Yumin to \nbecome strategic economic hubs and derive the benefits from the growing regional border trade. \n5.  However, Tacheng Prefecture is still lagging the central areas of XUAR significantly in \nterms of income levels and living conditions. The disposable income at CNY16,464 (2013) is \nconsiderably below the national average of CNY24,565. A lack of investment and planning, \nexacerbated  by  a  harsh  natural  environment  and  high  demographic  pressure,  has  led  to \noutdated and precarious urban infrastructure and municipal services in the cities of Tacheng, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  About 1.65% of the population of the PRC. \n3  The major groups are Hui, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and Uygur. \n4  Disposable income is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In the PRC, disposable income is \ncalculated separately for urban and rural citizens. \n5  State Council of the PRC. 2000. The National Strategy for Development of the Western Region. Beijing. The \nstrategy focuses on developing infrastructure, protecting the environment, and strengthening economic cooperation \nand trade with neighboring provinces and countries. \n6  The New Silk Road Economic Belt is a key element of the One Belt and One Road national strategy and aims to \npromote greater connectivity between the PRC and the central and western parts of Eurasia. Regional Cooperation \nand Integration (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  A recent example of this is the selection of Baktu Land Port as a green corridor for agricultural products between \nthe PRC and Kazakhstan. This pilot scheme aims to achieve faster and more efficient customs clearance and \ninspection of agricultural trade, and it is later to be replicated to other carefully selected land ports along the border. ", "2 \nEmin, Tuoli, and Yumin. 8 This situation is constraining not only socioeconomic development but \nalso wider regional economic integration across the prefecture and border trade. \n6.  The urban road network in the project cities is inadequate for the planned population \ngrowth and the resulting increase in commercial activities. The lack of roads increasingly makes \nthe urban areas difficult to access, causing serious economic and safety concerns for drivers, \nnonmotorized transport users, and pedestrians. Related to the poor quality of roads, access to \nbasic utilities is also low\u2014on average, 16% of households in the project cities are not connected \nto  clean  piped  water,  and  19%  are  not  connected  to  the  sewerage  system.  The  current \ncoverage rate of district heating in Tacheng City is only 65%, and a significant share of the \npopulation  still  relies  on  small  coal-fired  boilers  and  family  heating  stoves,  resulting  in \nsubstantial energy inefficiency and air pollution. Municipal solid waste (MSW) management \ncapacity is limited, sorting facilities are lacking, and collection systems are extremely basic, \nwhich  also  causes  considerable  environmental  pollution.  Tacheng  City  is  crossed  by  the \nKalangguer River, which carries snowmelt and storm flows from the mountains in the north. \nThroughout the city limits, the river remains unrestrained and some areas experience seasonal \nflooding that causes significant economic losses to its inhabitants. A considerable share of \nthese urban populations resides in neighborhoods connected by unpaved alleys. These areas \nlack access to basic urban services and safety features such as street lighting, making living \nconditions difficult, especially in the harsh winters. In addition, all project cities and counties are \nalso home to large numbers of ethnic minorities, whose members experience considerable \ndifficulties in adapting to the changing urban, economic, and social conditions. \n \n7.  In 2012, Tacheng City and the  counties of Emin, Tuoli, and Yumin approved  their \nrespective  master  plans  (2012\u20132030),  which  target  the  cities  to  become  livable  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable,  prioritizing  the  development  of  municipal  infrastructure  and \nservices  that  would  raise  the  living  standards  of  its  residents  and  support  their  effective \nintegration into the regional economy. The proposed project takes a multisector and integrated \napproach to urban development, meeting the urgent and prioritized needs identified in the \nmaster plans\u2014river rehabilitation; expansion of public and green spaces; improvements to the \nurban  road  network  and  traffic  management, water  supply  and  sewerage  services,  district \nheating service, solid waste collection system; and upgrading of equipment and services at the \nborder  land  port.9 The  proposed  project  will  contribute  indirectly  to  poverty  reduction  by \nenhancing the access of urban and peri-urban residents to upgraded municipal services and an \nimproved  urban  environment.  The  project  will  also  help  promote  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration (RCI). This will be achieved by enhancing the level of preparedness of the target \ncities and counties to participate and benefit from the growing regional border trade and for their \neffective integration as key hubs on the economic corridors of the New Silk Road Economic \nBelt.10 \n8.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  supports  a  key  goal  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2014making cities livable and sustainable through the creation of a \ncleaner and healthier environment.11 It also contributes to greater physical connectivity as set \n                                                \n8  Given greater rural\u2013urban migration, the urban population in Tacheng Prefecture has grown to 75% (2012) of the \ntotal population. Population growth prospects are considerable: Tacheng: 2014 (170,000), 2030 (320,000); Emin: \n2014 (95,000), 2030 (150,000); Tuoli: 2014 (42,000), 2030 (90,000); and Yumin: 2014 (50,000), 2030 (90,000). \n9  In a demand\u2013supply analysis undertaken during project preparatory technical assistance, it was concluded that the \nexisting and planned water and wastewater treatment plants have adequate capacity to accommodate the \nincreased demands arising from the proposed project components. \n10 Given their geographical proximity to corridors 1 and 2 of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nProgram, the project cities stand to benefit also from increasing investments and trade along these corridors. \n11 The project also supports ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming \nAsia and Pacific. Manila. ", "3 \nunder ADB\u2019s RCI strategy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic pillars of the country \npartnership  strategy,  i.e.,  to  support  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth  by \npromoting growth-oriented and resource-efficient urbanization. 12 It also supports the main thrust \nof  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan  by  promoting  green,  competitive,  and  inclusive  cities. \nSimilarly, the project will be in line with the Government of the PRC\u2019s upcoming Thirteenth Five-\nYear  Plan  because  it  supports  balanced  urbanization  in  developing  cities  that  are  livable, \nresource conserving, and inclusive. 13 By supporting greater connectivity with Kazakhstan, the \nproject is fully in line with the PRC\u2019s New Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, the creation of \neconomic corridors, and enhancement of RCI. It also supports XUAR\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan (2016\u20132020), which gives increasing priority to the development of border areas of the \nregion that are crucial in boosting regional trade. In addition, the project is aligned with the \nPRC\u2019s National Plan on New Urbanization (2014\u20132020) by accelerating the development of \nsmall and medium-sized cities and by promoting harmonious and coordinated development \nbetween cities and surrounding small towns. 14 \n9.  Continuity of development initiatives and incorporation of lessons. The project \ndesign incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in the \nPRC, particularly the four ongoing Xinjiang projects.15 For road construction, it avails of valuable \nexperience  from  the  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project.16 \nPractical lessons from the Xinjiang Altay Urban Infrastructure and Environment Improvement \nProject will apply to the establishment and maintenance of solid waste management systems.17 \nFollowing reduce, reuse, recycle (3R) principles, the project will play a demonstration role for \nsimilar cities with basic systems of collection and sorting of MSW. \n \n10.  Special features. The project includes many special features that are based on good \npractices implemented under ADB projects in more developed provinces of the PRC. Many of \nthese  features  have  potential  for  replication  in  other  areas  of  XUAR  or  even  other  less \ndeveloped  regions  of  the  PRC  with  similar  conditions.  In  addition,  these  special  features \nreinforce the integrated nature of the project and along with capacity building, aim to strengthen \nthe sustainability of the project. One such feature is integrated flood risk management\u2014the \nproject will produce structural measures (riverbank stabilization with enhancement of green \nspaces,  roadside  stormwater  retention,  and  infiltration)  and  nonstructural  measures  (flood \nforecasting and early flood warning, emergency response, and raising public awareness of flood \nrisk) that will allow Tacheng City to develop an integrated management approach to urban flood \nrisks. Adoption of best practices for MSW management is another feature\u2014the project will pilot \nMSW management based on 3R principles in selected communities by introducing integrated \nsorted-at-source collection systems, community participation, and optimization of organic and \nnonorganic waste disposal. Finally, border trade capacity will be stepped up as this is a critical \nsupplementary feature\u2014in addition to resourcing Baktu Land Port with goods and equipment, \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved urban environment, living conditions, and border trade \ncapacity in the project border cities and counties. The outcome will be enhanced delivery and \nefficiency of municipal services in the project border cities and counties. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will take a multisector and integrated approach to urban development where \noutdated  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  are  the  critical  constraints  to  economic \ndevelopment, improved environment, and living conditions. The project has five outputs. \n \n13.  Improved urban infrastructure and municipal services in Tacheng City. This will \nimprove  the  urban  infrastructure  and municipal  services  in  existing  and  new  urban  areas, \nincluding (i) rehabilitation of 15.2 kilometer (km) of Kalangguer River and expansion of public \nand green spaces by 37 hectares, (ii) construction of 29.5 km of urban roads (for a people-\ncentered urban transport system with emphasis on developing pedestrian and/or bicycle and \npublic transport), (iii) construction of 47.7 km of water supply piping network and 48.8 km of \nsanitary sewer piping network, (iv) construction of 40.6 km of primary hot water heating pipe \nnetwork and 21 hot water heat exchange stations, (v) rehabilitation of 14.1 km of urban alleys, \n(vi)  introduction  of  integrated  MSW  management  for  sorting  and  collection  in  selected \ncommunities,  (vii)  upgrade  of  city  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  equipment,  and            \n(viii) upgrade of equipment for Baktu Land Port. \n \n14.

Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $302.87  million  (Table  1).  The  government  has \nrequested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at the \n5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus a spread of 0.5%. Commitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year \nto be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  The loan will finance 49.53% of the project cost, including works, goods, and consulting \nservices and training. The loan will also finance taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed \nexpenditures, and transport and insurance costs. The government has provided ADB with the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions. The local governments and/or implementing agencies will provide \ncounterpart funding equivalent to $152.87 million, which will finance 50.47% of the project cost. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n20.  The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make it available through the Government \nof XUAR and the Tacheng Prefecture Government (TPG) to the local governments\u2014i.e., of \nTacheng City, and Emin, Tuoli, and Yumin counties\u2014on the same terms and conditions as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan.  As  the  end-borrowers,  the  local governments  will  assume foreign \nexchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan.  The  PRC,  XUAR,  Tacheng \nPrefecture, and local governments have assured ADB that counterpart funding will be provided \nin a timely manner, including any additional counterpart funding required for any shortfall of \n ", "6 \nfunds or cost overruns.

To expedite project implementation, the government requested ADB to approve advance \ncontracting, which includes the recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works; and \nretroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  for  consulting  services  and  civil  works \nprocurement. All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  All project outputs are designed taking into account local circumstances, topography, \nand climate in accordance with relevant PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The \ntransport component incorporates holistic road design and safety design considerations. The \nKalangguer River flood-control works, including riverbank revitalization, will greatly improve the \nresilience of the city to floods and at the same time embellish the urban environment. River \nembankment heights are based on the design flood height and include a 0.6-meter safety \nmargin to account for uncertainties in design assumptions and potential increases in storm \nintensity as a result of climate change.20 Where possible, the component designs incorporate \n3R approaches to MSW management and energy-efficient district heating supply. The detailed \nengineering design will comply with up-to-date urban design standards and specifications and \nadopt international best practices. A capacity-building program for related urban services is \nincluded in the project to ensure sustainable O&M of project facilities. A detailed description is in \nthe PAM. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic. The economic evaluation of the project was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects.21 The base-case economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) for individual subprojects as well as the project as a whole have been calculated. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the whole project is found to be economically viable. The net present \nvalue for the whole project is CNY362.0 million and the base-case EIRR for the whole project is \n15.3%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital. The EIRR for the Tacheng City \nsubproject is 15.5%; Emin, 13.8%; Tuoli, 16.2%; and Yumin, 14.6%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  return  is  robust  against  negative  impacts  from  benefit \nreduction, cost overrun, and project implementation delay. \n \n25.  Financial. The subprojects with a focus on cost recovery were analyzed based on key \nfinancial  ratios  describing  risk  and  profitability.  The  analysis  evaluated  their  viability  by \ncomparing their financial internal rates of return with the weighted average cost of capital. The \nreturns were computed at 4.5%\u20138.4%, all exceeding the respective weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  2.9%,  which  makes  the  proposed  investments  viable.  Counterpart  funding \nrequirements, debt service costs, and recurrent project O&M costs were compared with forecast \nrevenues and expenditures. The proposed fund-flow arrangement for the project is consistent \nwith ongoing ADB projects in XUAR and uses proven domestic disbursement procedures. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the management and staff of executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM,  including  providing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent and project \nimplementation consultant to strengthen procurement. The financial management assessment \nconcludes that, although the PMO and the implementing agencies have sufficient financial \nmanagement capacity, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and require a \ncomponent  to  build  their  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  line  with  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures. The procurement capacity assessment concludes that Tacheng Prefecture PMO, \n                                                \n20 The climate risk to the project was assessed through desk review, and is considered medium. Annual mean \ntemperature and annual precipitation are projected to increase significantly in the project area. \n21 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nimplementing agencies, and project implementation units (PIUs) lack experience in ADB- or \nforeign-funded project. Strong support from implementation consultants and a well-designed \ntraining program shall be provided to ensure effective and efficient project implementation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The direct beneficiaries of the project are mostly urban residents in the project areas of \nTacheng City and Emin, Tuoli, and Yumin counties of Tacheng Prefecture, accounting for \n256,751 people, including about 34,533 poor (13.4% of total beneficiaries); 127,268 women and \ngirls (49.6%); and 120,183 ethnic minority people (46.8%). The project will provide residents \nwith better roads and transport services, access to safe and reliable water supply and heating \nservices, and an improved living environment. Public awareness programs and implementation \nof transport safety and sanitation management will ensure the positive and long-term social \nbenefits of the project. Construction activities will directly create 1,286 temporary jobs during \nproject implementation; O&M of project outputs will directly create an estimated 237 permanent \njobs. Many temporary jobs will be available for unskilled labor, and contractors are encouraged \nto employ local workers whenever possible. The Tacheng Prefecture PMO has set employment \ntargets for women (30%), the poor (15%), and ethnic minorities (30%). The project city and/or \ncounty community offices and the Labor Bureau will assist contractors in realizing these targets. \nThe PIUs will ensure that all PRC labor laws and labor standards are complied with. This will be \nclosely  monitored  under  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Details  on  specific \nmeasures to ensure the poverty and social benefits are in the gender action plan (GAP), social \ndevelopment action plan in the PAM, and ethnic minority development plan (EMDP). \n \n28.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. More \neffective infrastructure will reduce time burdens, increase mobility and access, and boost public \nhealth. The poverty and social analysis revealed that women strongly support the project across \nall city and/or county, as it will improve their quality of life, mobility, access, and health, and \ncreate jobs and income opportunities. Gender has been mainstreamed into the project design \n(features such as road lighting, nonmotorized transport, and pedestrian access are included). \nThe GAP includes specific targets for women in terms of employment and participation, which \nhave been assured by the government. The GAP will ensure (i) women\u2019s consultation and \nparticipation in traffic safety and sanitation management awareness, transport services, and \nother  project  activities  (50%);  (ii)  jobs  and  income  opportunities  during  and  after  project \nimplementation  (30%);  (iii)  gender  sensitivity  training;  and  (iv)  appropriate  gender  targets, \nindicators, and sex-disaggregated data. The TPG will be responsible for implementing the GAP \nand reporting semiannually on progress and achievements of gender benefits under the project. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. The  project  environment  categorization  is  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared in accordance with \nthe requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on February 2015. Anticipated environmental impacts and risks are mostly modest and \nlocalized, and can be mitigated to an acceptable level through EMP implementation. Project \nconstruction will require significant earthwork, which will temporarily increase soil erosion.22 \nOther negative impacts during construction include noise, dust, temporary traffic disturbance, \nand localized deterioration of the Kalangguer River water quality caused by riverbank works. \nDuring operation, road improvements will minimize dust and inefficient driving practices but \noverall, traffic noise and greenhouse gas emissions will increase as traffic increases. The TPG \n                                                \n22 The project will require 2.71 million cubic meters of borrow and generate 0.97 million cubic meters of spoil, and \ncould induce 24,300 tons of soil erosion without soil protection measures. ", "9 \nwill delegate the overall EMP coordination to the Tacheng Prefecture PMO and implementation \nresponsibility to the PIUs. Capacity building will be provided to the Tacheng Prefecture PMO \nand PIUs in coordinating EMP implementation, and to relevant local authorities to properly \nmaintain project facilities, including periodic review of maintenance plans to account for potential \nincreases in maintenance requirements resulting from climate change. \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlements. The project will acquire about 1,474 mu of collective land and 1,481 mu of state-\nowned land.23 A total of 91,001 square meters including residential houses and 11,761 square \nmeters of shops and enterprises will be demolished. The permanent land acquisition and house \ndemolition will affect 684 households with 2,389 persons, of which 831 persons belong to ethnic \nminority groups. Nearly 237 households with 1,148 persons will suffer house demolition impacts \nand will be physically displaced. Four resettlement plans consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement have been developed for each project city and/or county. Compensation for \nlost assets and allowances will be at replacement costs and paid to affected persons prior to \ndisplacement. The resettlement information booklets have been disclosed to the community, \nvillage offices, and affected persons in both the Chinese and Kazakh languages in February \n2015. Resettlement plans have also been posted on the ADB website. Each city and/or county \nPMO and PIU will have at least two full-time resettlement staff, and each PIU will carry out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the resettlement plan. During \nproject implementation, training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be \nprovided to the PMO and/or PIU and resettlement management staff to make sure that land \nacquisition and resettlement activities is implemented properly. A grievance mechanism will be \nset up and an independent agency will be engaged for the semiannual external monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category B for the indigenous peoples. \nEthnic minorities in Tacheng Prefecture represent about 46.8% of the total population. The top \nseven minorities in the project area and Tacheng Prefecture, based on the latest census, are \nDaur, Hui, Kazakh, Mongolian, Russian, Uygur, and Xibe. The majority of ethnic people in these \ncounties are Kazakh, who, in 2012, represented over 76% of the ethnic minority population in \nthe  project  city  and/or  counties.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  found  that  the  urban \ncommunities are ethnically mixed and some aspects, such as cultural and language differences, \nare maintained. Not all ethnic minority people speak Mandarin, especially those middle-aged or \nolder. Accordingly, an EMDP has been developed to facilitate the inclusion of ethnic minority \npeople in all project activities and to protect them from any disadvantages that language barriers \nmay create with respect to employment by project contractors. The EMDP, endorsed by the \ngovernment, was disclosed in February 2015 in both the Mandarin and Kazakh languages to \nethnic minority people targeted by the project. The EMDP was also uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite. Detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements are included in the PAM. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n   \n                                                \n23 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak capacity of  implementing agencies  Provide training workshops to build capacity for project management office \nto effectively withdraw Asian Development  and implementing agency staff and relevant government agencies  \nBank (ADB) loan proceeds, delaying   \ndisbursement   (Before and during project implementation) \nLack of procurement capacity for ADB- or  (i)  Engage  start-up  consultant  for  bidding  document  preparation,  e.g., \nother foreign-funded projects, resulting in  technical specifications before the mobilization of loan implementation \npoor preparation of the procurement plan  consultants. \nand bidding documents, and in significant  (ii) Provide implementation consulting support for technical specifications in \ndelay of the process  the bidding documents and assist in tender documentation preparation. \n(iii) Engage tendering agent with significant ADB experience in a timely \nmanner  to  assist  with  contract,  bid  documentation,  bidding  and \nevaluation procedures, and appointment of contractors. \nCombined heat and power construction is  ADB will closely monitor combined heat and power preparations. \ndelayed and cannot supply hot water to  Existing heat-only boilers with total capacity of 650 megawatts are able to \nthe newly developed district heating  meet expected heat demand until 2018. \nnetwork \nDelay in land acquisition and resettlement  (i)  Assurance  from  Tacheng  Municipal  Government,  Emin  Municipal \napprovals and implementation  Government,  Tuoli  Municipal  Government,  and  Yumin  Municipal \nGovernment  on  the  availability  of  counterpart  funding  with  detailed \nfinancing plan. \n(ii)  Update of resettlement plans based on the final design and survey. \n(iii)  Institutional strengthening and training for carrying out land acquisition \nand resettlement tasks. \nUnsustainable operation and maintenance  (i)  Support for management improvement such as road maintenance and \nof infrastructure subprojects for lack of  traffic management. \ncapacity or budget, and delay in tariff  (ii) Capacity building and institutional strengthening support for prudent \nincrease  operational practices and training. \n(iii) Assurances  on  staff  resources,  operation  and  maintenance  budget \nprovisions, and water tariff increase (in Tacheng and Emin) for cost \nrecovery. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. In addition to ADB\u2019s standard assurances, the government has agreed to \nan initial set of specific assurances to be incorporated in the loan and project agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.
