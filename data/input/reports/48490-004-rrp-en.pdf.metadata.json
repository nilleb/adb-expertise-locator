The  coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) and associated containment measures have negatively affected the private \nsector in Fiji. The program supports the government\u2019s immediate response to COVID-19 as the \ngovernment  seeks  to  support  businesses  through  this  period.  The  reforms  will  support  the \neconomy\u2019s recovery from COVID-19 and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks. It \nsupports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProgrammatic  approach.  The  programmatic  approach  aligns  ADB\u2019s  support  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program over the medium to long term. It supports reforms to improve (i) \nfiscal  management,  particularly  public  financial  management  (PFM);  (ii)  the  policy,  legal,  and \ninstitutional framework for SOEs and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); and (iii) the business \nand investment climate. The programmatic approach and loan of $15 million for subprogram 1 \nwere both approved in June 2018. At the time of approval of the programmatic approach, it was \nindicated that subsequent loan amounts would equal $55 million for subprogram 2 (in 2019) and \n$110 million for subprogram 3 (in 2020), resulting in overall financial support of $180 million across \nthe three subprograms. To help the government meet its revised financing needs, the subprogram \n2 loan was approved in September 2019 for $65 million, $10 million above the originally indicated \namount, with the planned subprogram 3 loan to be reduced by a corresponding amount to $100 \nmillion.3 However, at the request of the government, the loan amount for subprogram 3 is now \nproposed to be increased to $200 million to help support the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19 in FY2020. \n  \nSubprogram 1 laid strong reform foundations, such as a PFM reform roadmap, legislative \n4. \nactions, and diagnostic efforts. Subprogram 2 focused on the gradual implementation of these \ninitiatives, while initiating new reforms when sufficient institutional capacity was present. All policy \nactions  achieved  during  subprograms  1  and  2  continue  to  be  complied  with.  Subprogram  3 \ncompletes reforms initiated in subprograms 1 and 2, but also takes stock and lays foundations for \nfuture  reforms.

While Fiji is classified as an upper-middle income country, it faces \nconstraints  common  among  small  island  developing  states,  including  a  remote  location,  a \ngeographically  dispersed  population,  a  high-cost  business  environment,  and  vulnerability  to \ndisasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards.  A  narrow  economic  base  and  heavy  reliance  on  the \ntourism industry make it vulnerable to external shocks.4 Public investment remains a key factor \ndriving  the  economy.  While  Fiji  recorded  only  18  confirmed  cases  of  COVID-19  as  of  25  June \n2020 and declared itself free of active cases on 5 June 2020, COVID-19 is having a devastating \nsocial, economic, and fiscal impact on Fiji, which is primarily driven by the shutdown of the tourism \nindustry.  A  growing  and  inclusive  private  sector  will  be  crucial  in  supporting  recovery  and \nbroadening the economic base to build resilience and reduce economic volatility.  \n \n6. \nRecent  economic  performance  and  shock.  Fiji  experienced  uninterrupted  economic \ngrowth  from  2010  to  2019,  supported  by  sound  macroeconomic  policies,  including  an \nexpansionary  fiscal  policy;  a  low  interest  rate  environment;  policy  consistency;  and  improving \nbusiness  confidence.  Fiji\u2019s  growing  tourism  industry  and  remittances  supported  its  external \nposition. Economic growth fell to 0.5% in 2019 as a global economic slowdown coincided with \ngovernment efforts to reduce fiscal stimulus, while growth had been projected to increase to 2.5% \nin  2020.5  However,  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  all  regularly  scheduled  international  flights  have \nbeen suspended since 26 March 2020, and hotels and tourism service providers have ceased \noperations,  temporarily  laying  off  workers.  The  initial  shock  to  the  accommodation  sector  has \nspread to other sectors, including wholesale and retail trade, construction, transport, real estate, \nand  finance.6  COVID-19  containment  measures  have  further  depressed  domestic  economic \nactivity.7 Remittance inflows, which are equivalent to about 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), \nare also expected to decline significantly. Furthermore, tropical cyclone Harold struck Fiji on 8\u20139 \nApril 2020, directly affecting more than 20% of the population, and causing at least $46.4 million \nin  damage.  As  a  result  of  the  combined  impact  of  these  shocks,  the  economy  is  forecast  to \ncontract by 15.0% in 2020.8 Assuming that there is no sustained local outbreak of COVID-19 in \nFiji,  the  depth  and  duration  of  the  economic  shock  will  depend  primarily  on  the  duration  of \ninternational travel restrictions in key tourism source markets, such as Australia and New Zealand.  \n \n7. \nFiscal situation and shock. Reliance on public sector-led growth resulted in an average \nfiscal deficit of 3.3% from FY2014 to FY2019 (Table 1).9 Recognizing the need to rebuild fiscal \nbuffers, the FY2020 national budget passed in July 2019 laid out a path of fiscal consolidation, \nwith projected fiscal deficits equivalent to 2.7% of GDP in FY2020, 2.0% of GDP in FY2021, and \n1.5%  of  GDP  in  FY2022.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  has  disrupted  this  effort.  The  government \nannounced a COVID-19 response budget on 23 March 2020 that includes a $460 million response \n\n \n\n4  The  government  estimates  that  the  tourism  industry  contributed  34%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2017. \n\nGovernment of Fiji.

The forecast is based on the assumption of gradual easing of international travel restrictions from the fourth \nquarter of 2020, resulting in a slow recovery of tourism arrivals. The IMF has projected GDP will contract by 18.4% \nin 2020 and rebound by 11.5% in 2021 (footnote 6). \n\n9   For  purposes  of  comparison,  fiscal  year  data  is  shown,  sourced  from  government  budget  documents  and  ADB \nestimates.

The \nwidening deficit is driven by a projected decline in total revenue equivalent to 5.3% of GDP from \nFY2019 to FY2020. Public debt is projected to increase from 48.9% of GDP in FY2019 to 60.9% \nof GDP in FY2020, and is expected to rise further in FY2021. Despite rising quickly in the context \nof COVID-19, public debt is expected to remain manageable and stabilize at around 70% of GDP \nin subsequent years, supported by continued sound macroeconomic policies and renewed fiscal \nconsolidation.10  \n \n\nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n\n3.5 \n4.1 \n \n\n0.5 \n1.8 \n \n\nof which: External debt \n\nFY2014 \n5.6 \n0.5 \n\nFY2017 \n5.4 \n3.3 \n \n\nFY2015 \n4.7 \n1.4 \n \n\nFY2016 \n2.5 \n3.9 \n \n\n28.5 \n30.4 \n6.8 \n1.9 \n(1.8) \n43.0 \n12.7 \n4,682.5 \n\n28.8 \n32.6 \n6.8 \n1.9 \n(3.8) \n44.0 \n13.1 \n4,930.2 \n\n28.6 \n33.0 \n7.7 \n0.0 \n(4.4) \n46.0 \n12.8 \n5,536.8 \n\n25.9 \n29.7 \n6.1 \n0.1 \n(3.8) \n44.5 \n13.7 \n4,850.3 \n\n26.6 \n28.7 \n7.4 \n0.0 \n(2.1) \n43.9 \n12.9 \n5,353.5 \n\n27.1 \n30.7 \n5.9 \n0.0 \n(3.6) \n48.9 \n12.4 \n5,483.3 \n\nFY2018  FY2019e  FY2020p \n(15.0) \n1.2 \n \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth (% change) \nCPI change (% annual average) \nCentral government budget (% of GDP) \n21.8 \nTotal revenue \n \n30.8 \n \nTotal expenditure \n(1.3) \n  Operating balance \n1.8 \n  Asset sales \n(9.0) \n \nFiscal (deficit) \n60.9 \nPublic debt (% of GDP) \n17.4 \n \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n4,711.6 \n( ) = negative, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nNote: 2020 GDP numbers are a projection by the Asian Development Bank.

Fiji\u2019s  narrow  economic  base,  high  import  demand,  and \nweak  merchandise  export  sector  make  it  susceptible  to  external  shocks.  From  2010  to  2018, \ngrowth was driven by public investment.11 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended \n(i) gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to achieve a downward trend in the ratio of public debt-to-\nGDP;  (ii)  enhancing  the  business  environment  and  strengthening  governance  to  foster  private \ninvestment, enhance productivity, and raise potential growth; and (iii) tackling the gender gap in \nlabor force participation to boost inclusive economic growth (footnote 6). While continued fiscal \nstimulus  is  considered  appropriate  in  response  to  COVID-19,  business  environment  reform  is \ncritical to support the economic recovery and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks. \nAs a regional hub for business, transport, and communications, the recovery of Fiji\u2019s private sector \nand SOEs will also play an important role in the economic recovery of the Pacific region. \n \n9. \nBinding  constraints.  The  government  recognizes  the  challenges  it  faces  in  reducing \nreliance on public sector-led growth, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. It must gradually ease \nfiscal stimulus to rebuild fiscal buffers, while improving the effectiveness of public investment and \nthe strategic allocation of resources. To do so, the government must (i) regularly review public \nsector  performance,  such  as  through  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA) \nassessments and public expenditure reviews, to prioritize expenditure and reforms; (ii) strengthen \nthe  strategic  planning  and  budget  process  to  ensure  that the  lifetime  costs  of  investments  are \n\n \n\n10 The IMF assessed (i) the fiscal stimulus to be appropriate given the severity of the shock and the need for a counter-\ncyclical response; and (ii) public debt to be sustainable, despite the rapid rise in debt in 2020 as a result of the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Public debt as a proportion of GDP is expected to peak in 2020 and then decline, helped \nby a rebound in growth that will boost fiscal revenues and increase GDP, but this medium-term path is vulnerable to \nsignificant risks (footnote 6). Updated medium-term fiscal projections will be published in the FY2021 national budget. \n11 Total investment averaged 19.9% of GDP in 2010\u20132018. Public investment rose from 3.6% of GDP in 2010\u20132013 to \n5.6% of GDP in 2014\u20132018. Private and SOE investment fell from 12.5% of GDP to 11.7% of GDP over the same \nperiod.

It  must  also  improve  SOE  performance,  as  SOEs  deliver  most  infrastructure \nservices in Fiji. To do so, the government must strengthen policy and institutional frameworks for \ngovernment  ownership  of  SOEs  and  financial  transactions  with  SOEs  (onlending  and \nguarantees).  Improved  governance  and  performance  will  help  SOEs  access  finance  on \ncommercial terms. It must facilitate private sector participation to bring in investment, innovation, \nand expertise; and in doing so must have clear privatization and PPP policies and guidelines, and \ntransparently  pursue  divestment  and  PPPs,  where  feasible.  The  government  must  also \nstrengthen the business climate to facilitate private investment by (i) reforming outdated foreign \ninvestment  and  competition  legislation,  (ii)  removing  barriers  to  international  trade,  (iii) \nimplementing  collateral  reforms  to  facilitate  innovation  and  access  to  finance,  (iv)  streamlining \nconstruction permit applications and approvals, and (v) strengthening intellectual property rights. \nIt must also support businesses to withstand the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nGovernment  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  National  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132036 \nenvisions inclusive socioeconomic development through a strategy to become a regional South \nPacific hub for business, transport, and other services.12 To contain the COVID-19 outbreak and \nlimit the risk of local transmission, the government developed (i) a $38.4 million health system \npreparedness  and  response  plan;  and  (ii)  a  $460  million  COVID-19  response  budget  with \nmeasures to boost the economy, and provide social protection for the poor and vulnerable. With \nsupport  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  the  government  is  accelerating  reforms  to \naddress  binding  constraints  to  private  sector-led  growth  (para.  9).  These  reforms  will  support \neconomic recovery from COVID-19 and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks.  \n \n11. \nIncreased Subprogram 3 Loan Amount. The programmatic approach provides flexibility \nto respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. In subprogram 3, this includes supporting \nthe  government\u2019s  rapid  response  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19,  as  outlined  in  the  COVID-19 \nresponse  budget,  and  for  which  the  government  has  requested  an  increase  in  the  ADB  loan \namount for subprogram 3 from $100 million to $200 million.13 The proposed increase in the loan \namount reflects the alignment of the reform areas with the focal areas of the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 response. The use of the policy-based loan modality in FY2020 maintains the government\u2019s \nreform momentum and expands this to reflect relevant COVID-19 responses, leaving open the \npossibility  of  the  use  of  a  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option  operation  in  FY2021,  if \nrequested  by  the  government,  in  the  case  that  additional  government  stimulus  measures  are \nrequired to address an extended period of COVID-19 related border closures.14 \n \n12. \nAlignment. The program (i) supports the government\u2019s COVID-19 response; (ii) is aligned \nwith the government\u2019s policy priorities in the National Development Plan; and (iii) is aligned with \nthe values and objectives of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism.15 The program is consistent \n\n12 Government  of  Fiji, Ministry  of  Economy.  2017. 5-Year  &  20-Year  National  Development  Plan:  Transforming  Fiji. \n\n13 Government of Fiji, Ministry of Economy. 2020.

Under subprogram 3, ADB supports 23 policy actions across three reform \nareas contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) and described in paras. 15\u201317. All 23 policy \nactions have been completed.18 \n \nSome indicative actions for subprogram 3 were adjusted. The overall strength has been \n14. \nimproved with the addition of new policy actions, including relating to the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 response, and changes to increase the substance of the policy actions.19 The strengthened \nmatrix reflects the additional financing requested by the government.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSix actions were added to subprogram 3. A PEFA assessment and a PEFA self-\nassessment of gender-responsive PFM were completed. Fiji\u2019s Cabinet decided to \nintroduce  gender-responsive  budgeting  (GRB)  in  the  FY2021  budget;  budget \nsubmission templates that incorporate associated principles were introduced and \npiloted by two ministries. This is a critical step to ensure the strategic allocation of \nresources  for  government  priorities  in  future  budgets.  Through  the  COVID-19 \nresponse budget, additional resources were allocated for COVID-19 containment \nand  treatment,  and  the  total  budgeted  expenditure  was  reduced  to  contain  the \nfiscal deficit in a fiscally sustainable manner; specific measures to assist the private \nsector were also approved.  \nSeveral indicative actions were changed to increase their substance. Fiji\u2019s solicitor-\ngeneral has notified the secretary-general of the Parliament that four bills approved \nby  the  Cabinet\u2014on  investment,  trademarks,  designs,  and  patents\u2014will  be \nintroduced in a regular 2020 sitting of Parliament, through the Solicitor-General\u2019s \nletter of 23 June 2020 on Introduction of Certain Bills to Parliament.20 A planning \nframework  to  align  the  service  delivery,  staffing,  and  corporate  planning \nrequirements  of  ministries  was  implemented  across  all  government  ministries \nahead  of  schedule.  The  government  exceeded  its  own  targets  for  shifting  from \nmanual to digital payments. \n\n \n\n16 ADB. 2019.

The World Bank\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability and Climate Resilience \nDevelopment  Policy  Operation  and  Fiji  Second  Fiscal  Sustainability  and  Climate  Resilience  Development  Policy \nOperation were aligned to the matrix in subprograms 1 and 2, and the World Bank is preparing a new operation for \napproval in late 2020. \n\n18 The  program  does  not  distinguish  between  prior  actions  (triggers)  and  policy  milestones,  with  these  collectively \n\nreferred to as policy actions. Milestones strengthen the program and lay the foundation for ongoing reform. \n\n19 Further details and reasons for the changes are summarized in Changes from Subprogram 3 Indicative Policy Actions \n\nto Final Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n20 This allows for a notice to be published in the Gazette and the bills to be introduced in a regular sitting of Parliament \n\nin 2020. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(iii) \n\nTwo  actions  were  removed  from  subprogram  3.  Cabinet  approval  of  a  Public \nFinancial  Management  Bill  for  tabling  in  Parliament  has  been  delayed  due  to  a \nchange in the development partner providing TA and staff turnover, and this will \nbe  pursued  through  the  PPPF.  An  action  related  to  the  appointment  or  use  of \ntransaction  advisory  services  for  PPP  transactions  was  removed,  as  it  was  not \nrelevant in the subprogram 3 period, as no new PPP transactions were initiated.21  \n \n\n15. \nReform area 1: Fiscal management improved. The government recognizes that sound \nPFM systems and processes that promote fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and \nefficient service delivery provide the private sector with policy certainty and business confidence, \nas  well  as  more  cost-effective  public  services.  In  the  immediate  term  this  area  addresses  the \neconomic  and  social  risks  of  COVID-19  by  mobilizing  the  government  response  in  a  fiscally \nsustainable manner. The following subprogram 3 policy actions support this outcome: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\nimplement \n\nthe  Public  Financial  Management \n\nPublic  financial  management  framework.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE) \ncontinued \nImprovement \nProgramme,  2016\u20132019  approved  in  subprogram  1.22  A  high-level,  multi-sector \npublic  expenditure  review  of  health,  education,  capital  spending,  and  personnel \nwas completed, and a synopsis was published on the MOE\u2019s website. The public \nexpenditure  review  analyzes  public  finance  effectiveness  and  consistency  with \npolicy  priorities.  Strengthening  of  the  budget  process  continued  through  the \nincorporation of forward estimates, and by linking investments and recurring costs \nin  the  FY2021  budget  submission  templates.  In  subprogram  2,  a  planning \nframework to align service delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements \nwas piloted by four ministries. In subprogram 3, all ministries have adopted its use \nwell ahead of a planned expansion to three additional ministries in subprogram 3. \nA PEFA assessment was completed and published that will guide the development \nof a new PFM roadmap.23 Fiji was one of seven countries globally to pilot the PEFA \nself-assessment  of  gender-responsive  PFM,  and  received  \u201cPEFA  check\u201d \napproval.24 The assessment informed the government\u2019s GRB pilot and provides a \nmodel  for  adoption  by  other  countries  in  the  Pacific.  Parliament  passed  a \nsupplementary COVID-19 response budget that allocates additional resources for \nCOVID-19 containment and treatment, reduces budgeted expenditures to contain \nthe fiscal deficit in a fiscally sustainable manner, and provides updated key fiscal \nprojections (including on revenue, expenditure, and debt). \nFinancial  management.  To  guide  improvements  in  the  FMIS,  the  responsible \nminister approved the recommendations of the review undertaken in subprogram \n2, and the MOE is writing detailed business and technical requirements to enable \nthe  purchase  of  two  priority  modules  (budget  reporting  and  monitoring,  and \nbusiness intelligence). While an upgrade of the whole FMIS is planned, updating \nof  these  modules  will  enable  immediate  improvements.  The  government  now \n\n \n\n21  Existing PPP transactions continue with transaction advisors appointed under subprograms 1 and 2. The removed \naction required the government to use transaction advisors for any new PPPs. In a small island developing state \nsuch as Fiji, it is not expected that potential PPP transactions would be ready for appointment of advisors each year. \nThe  government  is  assessing  new  PPP  opportunities,  including  with  TA  from  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership.  \n\n22 Government of Fiji. 2016.

The  2020  PEFA  assessment  demonstrates  improvements  in  PFM  since  2013,  and  its  publication \ndemonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to transparency and increased accountability. \n\n24 The PEFA Check confirms that the processes used in planning and implementing a PEFA assessment and preparing \n\na PEFA report comply with the PEFA 2016 methodology and other guidance issued by the PEFA Secretariat.  \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n(iii) \n\nmakes 92% of payments digitally, including for social welfare recipients as part of \nthe COVID-19 response. \nGender-responsive budgeting. The MOE has embraced the potential gains from \nintroducing  GRB.  While  completing \nthe  PEFA  self-assessment,  practical \nimplementation  efforts  have  included  procuring  software  to  enable  \u201cgender \ntagging\u201d  and  a  Cabinet  decision  on  introducing  and  rolling  out  GRB.  The  MOE \nworked with the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MWCPA) to \ndevelop  a  methodology  that  will  be  used  by  two  pilot  ministries  for  their  budget \nsubmissions  for  FY2021.25  Lessons  from  the  pilot  will  be  used  to  inform  and \nexpand GRB in Fiji and across the region. \n \n\n16. \nReform  area  2:  Policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  state-owned \nimproved.  Fiji\u2019s  SOEs  provide  most \nenterprises  and  public\u2013private  partnerships \ninfrastructure services in Fiji, and play an important role for trade and tourism connectivity in the \nPacific region.26 SOE profitability has improved markedly since 2010, but productivity remains low \nin many SOEs, and the government is seeking to improve their performance, including through \nSOE divestment, outsourcing, and PPPs to increase private sector investment, innovation, and \nexpertise.27 Reforms to improve SOEs\u2019 financial management and internal governance will enable \nSOEs to access finance on commercial terms, which will help them to withstand economic shocks, \nincluding those associated with COVID-19. With ADB support, the following subprogram 3 policy \nactions have been implemented: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nState-owned enterprise reform. The Public Enterprises Act 2019 was passed by \nParliament  in  subprogram  2  to  strengthen  SOE  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability;  and  improve  performance  and  service  delivery.  It  has  come  into \nforce,  and  required  regulations  are  in  place.28  Training  programs  on  the \ncompliance requirements of the Public Enterprises Act 2019 have been conducted, \ncovering  76%  of  directors  and  80%  of  senior  management,  including  90%  of \nwomen  in  these  roles.29  Cabinet  has  approved  a  new  policy  for  onlending  to \ngovernment entities, including SOEs, to better manage associated fiscal risks; the \nonlending  policy  complements  a  guarantee  policy  approved  in  subprogram  2. \nPrivatization guidelines have come into force, with clear and transparent rules and \nprocedures for preparing and executing SOE divestments. The onlending policy \nand privatization guidelines were published on the MOE\u2019s website. \nDivestment  and  public\u2013private  partnerships.  Two  SOEs\u2014Food  Processors \n(Fiji) Limited and Fiji Rice Limited\u2014have restructured their balance sheets through \nthe sale of non-core assets, including land and buildings.30 PPP implementation \n\n \n\n25 The Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport and Ministry of Fisheries have committed to pilot gender-\nbased budgeting for at least two of their programs. The methodology and new budget submission templates will be \ndistributed to all ministries, and other ministries may choose to also participate in the pilot.  \n\n26 Air Pacific Limited (trading as Fiji Airways), Airports Fiji Limited, and Fiji Ports Corporation Limited in particular offer \n\nessential services in air and maritime transport for Fiji and the Pacific region. \n\n27 The portfolio\u2019s average return on equity for 2015\u20132018 was 9.9%, with a return on assets of 4.2%. For 2010\u20132014, \n\nthe average return on equity was 3.3% and the return on assets was 1.5%. \n\n28 Among other key features, the act (i) harmonizes different forms of SOEs under a single framework; (ii) establishes \na framework for the identification, costing, contracting, and financing of community-service obligations that applies \nto  all  SOEs;  (iii)  makes  the  minister  for  public  enterprises  solely  responsible  for  SOEs,  with  clear  duties  and \nresponsibilities; and (iv) strengthens the appointment process for directors, and their duties and responsibilities. \n29 This compares to less than 25% people in such positions trained in 2017. The training was considered important to \nensure implementation of the new act and that directors and management can be held to account for performance. \nThe training was attended by 11 of the 13 women directors (85%) and all 7 women in senior management (100%).  \n30 In the COVID-19 response budget, the government announced its intention to convert government loans to equity \nfor five agriculture sector SOEs\u2014Fiji Sugar Corporation, PAFCO, Fiji Rice Limited, Food Processors (Fiji) Limited, \nand Viti Corp Company Limited\u2014to strengthen their balance sheets. \n\n \n\n\fguidelines,  including  on  the  PPP  procurement  process,  which  complement  the \nPPP  policy  approved  under  subprogram  2,  were  approved  by  Cabinet  and \npublished on the MOE\u2019s website.  \n \n\nReform area 3: Business and investment climate improved. Foreign direct investment \n17. \nin Fiji averaged 6.7% of GDP from 2010 to 2018, and is constrained by a weak investment climate \naffected by policy uncertainty and gaps in the commercial legal framework. Proactive measures \nare also required to ensure women\u2019s private sector participation, and inclusive and sustainable \neconomic  development  in  the  immediate,  medium  and  longer  term.  Reforms  to  improve  the \nbusiness  and  investment  climate  are  being  undertaken  in  consultation  with  the  private  sector. \nThese  reforms  will  stimulate  new  private  investment,  which  is  essential  as  Fiji\u2019s  economy \nrecovers.  The  COVID-19  response  budget  included  targeted  measures  to  support  business \nsurvival during the downturn. These reforms are achieved through the following subprogram 3 \npolicy actions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nForeign investment and trade. To strengthen investor rights and streamline the \ninvestment approval process, a new Investment Bill was approved by Cabinet for \ntabling  in  Parliament,  and  the  solicitor-general  notified  the  secretary-general  of \nparliament that the Investment Bill will be introduced in a regular 2020 sitting of \nParliament.31 The bill, when enacted, will replace the Foreign Investment Act 1999, \nand it builds on the policy statement approved in subprogram 2. To improve trade \ncompetitiveness,  the  government  has  completed  five  World  Trade  Organization \nTrade Facilitation Agreement commitments.32 These reforms will decrease barriers \nto international and regional trade and foreign direct investment flows.  \nAccess  to finance.  The  Personal  Property  Securities  Registry  was  established \nfollowing  the  passing  of  the  associated  act  and  implementing  regulations  in \nsubprograms  1  and  2,33  enabling  lenders  to  more  easily,  cheaply,  and  securely \naccept movable assets as security for loans. This particularly benefits businesses \nowned by women, who are less likely to have fixed assets, such as land. \nEase  of  doing  business.  The  Regulation  of  Building  Permits  Act  2017,  which \nsimplifies construction permit applications and speeds approvals, was approved in \nsubprogram 1. It has come into force, and application forms have been streamlined \nand  harmonized,  and  an  online  portal  launched  to  provide  easier  access  to \ninformation for those submitting applications. Following stakeholder consultations \nin  subprogram  2,  Cabinet  approved  bills  to  enhance  the  legal  framework  for \ntrademarks, designs, and patents; and the solicitor-general notified the secretary-\ngeneral of Parliament that the bills will be introduced in a regular 2020 sitting of \nParliament  (footnote  31).34  Cabinet  approved  a  competition  and  consumer \n\n \n\n31 All bills that are tabled will undergo validation and gender analysis by the parliamentary standing committee with \n\njurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill. \n\n32 These commitments are provisions that the World Trade Organization member will implement after a transitional \nperiod  following  the  entry  into  force  of  the  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement.  The  five  commitments  completed in \nsubprogram 3 are: Article 1.3 Enquiry Points; Article 1.4 Notification; Article 3 Advance Rulings; Article 7.7 Trade \nFacilitation  Measures  for  Authorized  Operators;  and  Article  10.3  Use  of  International  Standards.  The  Trade \nFacilitation Agreement was ratified under subprogram 1, and four commitments were completed in subprogram 2. \n33 The Personal Property Securities Act 2017 came into force when the Registry was established and launched. This \ncompletes the reform and the framework is fully operational. As of 31 March 2020, over 57,500 filings were recorded. \nPersonal property securities reform has been completed in nine Pacific developing member countries with support \nfrom ADB, resulting in harmonization of legal frameworks.

Sydney. \n\n34 In May 2020, Parliament referred international treaties on intellectual property (the Madrid Agreement Concerning \nthe International Registration of Marks, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, and the Paris Convention for \nProtection of Industrial Property) to the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs and Defense for review. Submissions \nwere heard in June 2020. These treaties enable international recognition of intellectual property rights among parties. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n(iv) \n\nfinancial \n\nintroduced,  via \n\nthe  government \n\nimpact  of  COVID-19, \n\nprotection policy statement, and the drafting of associated legislation, which sets \nout  the  government's  commitments  in  facilitating  a  well-functioning  competitive \nmarket  economy.  This  follows  extensive  consultations  on  a  review  of  the  Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission Act 2010 undertaken in subprogram 2.35  \nCoronavirus disease response. To help the private sector and workers mitigate \nthe \nthe \nsupplementary  COVID-19  response  budget  for  FY2020  (i)  a  reduction  in \nemployers\u2019 statutory Fiji National Provident Fund contributions until 31 December \n2020;  (ii)  21  days  government-paid  sick  leave  for  workers  who  test  positive  to \nCOVID-19;  (iii)  tax  deductions  for  employers  for  wages  and  salary  paid  to \nemployees  who  are  self-quarantined;  (iv)  additional  contributions  to  financial \nsector schemes that boost lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); \nand  (v)  relief  payments  to  informal  sector  workers,  including  for  women-owned \nmicroenterprises  such  as  hawkers,  in  lockdown areas.36  In  addition,  a  guidance \nnote on the gendered impacts of COVID-19 in Fiji was presented to Cabinet by the \nMWCPA;  a  newly  established  government-led  COVID-19  Response  Gender \nWorking Group will oversee further analysis and implement recommendations into \nfuture COVID-19 assessments and responses.37 \n \n\n18. \nPost-program partnership framework. Major reforms have been achieved through the \nprogram;  however,  continued  reform  is  needed.  The  four  bills  approved  by  the  Cabinet\u2014on \ninvestment, trademarks, designs, and patents\u2014will be tabled in Parliament, and upon approval \nimplemented. The Public Financial Management Bill, which was removed from subprogram 3, will \nbe  finalized  and  tabled  in  Parliament.  Work  started  in  subprogram  3  to  mainstream  GRB  will \ncontinue  after  learning  from  the  pilots.  Ongoing  improvements  to  the  operations  of  SOEs  are \nanticipated,  and  SOEs  involved  in  air  and  maritime  transport  will  facilitate  delivery  of  services \ncritical to post-COVID-19 economic recovery in Fiji and the Pacific region. A PFM roadmap will \nbe developed from the PEFA Assessment to clearly guide the future reform program. Details of \nthe PPPF can be found in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n \n19. \nGender. Subprogram 3 is classified gender equity theme. Subprogram 3 includes policy \nactions  that  will  have  a  transformational  impact  on  gender  equality,  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment,  and  women\u2019s  access  to  resources  and  services.  To  address  the  immediate \nimpacts of COVID-19, actions included: (i) support for SMEs owned or led by women; (ii) direct \ncash  transfers  to  informal  workers,  including  for  microenterprises  owned  by  women  (such  as \nhawkers);  and (iii)  a  guidance  note  on the  gendered  impacts  of  COVID-19  in  Fiji  presented  to \nCabinet,  and  the  establishment  of  a  COVID-19  Gender  Working  Group  to  act  on  the \nrecommendations  from  the  paper.  To  increase  women\u2019s  voice  and  access  to  services  and \nresources, the government carried out a number of actions to introduce GRB. To ensure a gender-\nresponsive  business  and  investment  climate,  actions  included:  (i)  gender  analysis  on  the \ninvestment, trademarks, designs and patents bills by the Parliamentary Standing Committee with \njurisdiction  over  the  subject  matter  of  the  bills;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  a  sex-disaggregated \nPersonal  Property  Securities  Registry  that  allows  women  to  more  easily  access  finance;  and \n\n \n\n35 In addition, the government is implementing reforms on starting a business, including digitization of its companies\u2019 \n\nregistry and business licensing reforms, with technical support from Singapore Cooperation Enterprise. \n\n36 Additional contributions  were made  to  the  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  and  Natural  Disaster  Rehabilitation  Facility, \nwhich makes loans available to banks at very low interest rates to pass on to SMEs impacted by COVID-19 at a \ncapped interest rate. These schemes are administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and are particularly important to \nprovide finance for SMEs owned by women, which are less likely to have capital or insurance to sustain operations. \n37 The Working Group is led by MWPCA and includes representatives of civil society and women\u2019s rights organizations, \n\nADB and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). \n\n \n\n\f(iii) a Cabinet-approved competition and consumer protection policy statement with a commitment \nto supporting women\u2019s consumer rights. These actions will expand the use of GRB in government \nprograms  and  ensure  that  future  COVID-19  programs  include  targeted  measures  for  women\u2019s \neconomic  empowerment.  Ultimately,  the  longer-term  effect  of  the  reforms  will  ensure  inclusive \nprivate sector-led growth; increased access to quality services for women and girls; and women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment during and following the COVID-19 crisis.  \n \n20. \nADB engagement. ADB has supported PFM reform, SOE reform, and business climate \nreform through regional and country-specific TA projects.38 There is strong collaboration with the \ngovernments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  the  European  Union,  the  IMF\u2019s  Pacific  Financial \nTechnical Assistance Centre, and the World Bank, and all are supporting these reforms. ADB\u2019s \nstrong  relationship  with  the  government  enabled  ADB  to  help  identify  and  implement  critical \nstructural reforms. Specifically, ADB has directly supported the introduction of GRB; the drafting \nof  policy  or  legislation  on  SOEs,  PPPs,  personal  property  securities,  and  competition  and \nconsumer protection; and has provided implementation support. ADB supported the drafting of a \nguidance  note  on  the  gendered  impacts  of  COVID-19  in  Fiji,  and  ADB  is  a  member  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 Gender Working Group. The programmatic approach has enabled the \nsequencing of complex reforms, with ADB TA involvement across all reform areas in support of \nall subprograms, aligned with development partners.   \n \nLessons from ADB\u2019s engagement in these areas in Fiji and across the Pacific, including \n21. \nfrom  implementing  subprograms  1  and  2,  highlight  the  need  to:  (i)  identify  champions  to \nstrengthen reform commitment and lead implementation; (ii) obtain broad endorsement so that \nreforms  are  not  derailed  if  leadership  changes;  (iii)  pursue  moderate,  sequenced  reforms, \nespecially  if  institutional capacity  is  limited; (iv)  provide  sufficient time to develop  capacity  and \ninstitutionalize reforms; (v) meet with government specialists responsible for undertaking specific \nreforms  (in  addition  to  senior  officials)  to  ensure  appropriate  technical  input;  (vi)  create  clear \ntracking tools to monitor progress toward final outcomes; and (vii) showcase the impact of reforms \nto other countries in the Pacific region, such as through regional fora or knowledge products, to \nencourage harmonization of reform in the region.39 \n \n22. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The program is part of a multi-development partner \npackage  of  support  for  structural  reform.  The  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  will \nprovide grants, and AIIB will provide a loan in 2020 linked to the completion of the ADB policy \nactions. The World Bank is preparing a new development policy operation series for approval in \nlate 2020. Joint missions have been undertaken to develop subprogram 3 with cofinanciers, and \nregular development partner meetings are held to coordinate reforms (para. 20). \n \nC. \n \nImplementation of the policy actions for the overall reform program will improve the quality \n23. \nof budget systems and institutions; improve the productivity and competitiveness of SOEs; and \nhelp create new businesses and formal job growth, including for women.40 It will also mitigate the \nimpact of COVID-19 on businesses, workers, the poor and vulnerable through targeted transfers. \nThe GRB actions will increase awareness of the cost of gender inequality; increase capacity and \ndata related to gender equality; increase budget transparency, accountability and participation; \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \n\n38 ADB.

GRB actions will also \nhave impacts across the region as lessons will inform GRB initiatives in other Pacific countries. \nImproving  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  SOEs  will  strengthen  governance, \ntransparency, and accountability; improve performance and service delivery; reduce contingent \nliabilities;  create  room  for  private  investment;  and  improve  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and \naffordability of public services. Fiji\u2019s business environment reforms are expected to increase its \nease of doing business score from 61.5 in 2019 to at least 64.0 by 2020, which would bring Fiji\u2019s \nperformance above that of the Philippines (62.8) and close to that of Malta (66.1) in 2019.41  \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 3.42 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n25. \nThe subprogram 3 financing will help meet the government\u2019s total financing requirements \nfor FY2020\u2014 projected at $580 million, including the COVID-19 response budget\u2014and FY2021. \nIn  FY2020,  the  external  financing  need  is  $268  million,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  74.8%  and \ncofinancing  partners  will  finance  19.5%  as  part  of  the  program.  Parallel  collaborative  partner \ncofinancing includes a loan of $50 million from AIIB, a grant of $1.5 million (NZ$2.5 million) from \nthe  Government  of  New  Zealand,  and  a  grant  of  $0.7  million  (AU$1.0  million)  from  the \nGovernment  of  Australia.43  The  gap  will  be  filled  by  grants  and  concessional  loans  from \ndevelopment  partners  and  domestic  bonds.  Additional  funding  (of  over  $9.1  million)  has  been \nprovided  by  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to  assist  with  the  COVID-19 \nresponse. The program has considered the government\u2019s financing needs, its ability to rebuild \nfiscal buffers to respond to disasters triggered by natural hazards, the availability of alternative \nfinancing and estimated financial support from other partners, and debt sustainability. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe implementation period for subprogram 3 is May 2019\u2013October 2020. The preparation \nand completion of policy actions for subprogram 3 was carried out from May 2019 to June 2020. \nThe MOE was the executing agency for all three subprograms. The MOE has taken the lead in \ncoordinating  implementation  of  actions;  engaging  in  progress  meetings  with  the  Ministry  of \nCommerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport;  the  MWCPA;  and  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  as \nimplementing agencies, and providing updates to ADB. The MOE has also actively coordinated \npolicy dialogue and needed technical support for the program reforms with partners (para. 20). \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).44 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n41 The World Bank. Doing Business. Reforms under the program are expected to improve scores for the following Doing \nBusiness  topics:  (i)  getting  credit  (personal  property  securities  reform);  (ii)  trading  across  borders  (Word  Trade \nOrganization  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  implementation);  and  (iii)  dealing  with  construction  permits  (building \npermits reform). \n\n42 Subprogram 3 was originally planned as a $100 million program, following the outbreak of COVID-19 the government \n\nrequested an additional $100 million to reflect revised forecasts of financing needs. \n\n43 The Government of Australia and AIIB are new cofinancing partners. \n44 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n27. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 3 is classified category \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n28. \nRisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.45 PFM systems are assessed as capable \nof supporting reliable service provision. Policy reforms and TA support will address other fiduciary \nrisks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate.  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nADB  will  monitor  national  and  global  economic  developments  and \nrespond in a timely manner and in coordination with other partners to \npossible  government  requests  for  assistance  if  the  economic \ndownturn becomes more severe than anticipated. \n\nRisks \nThe COVID-19 pandemic undermines \neconomic growth and Fiji\u2019s fiscal position to \nthe point that it diverts political and \nadministrative focus and capacity away from \nreforms. \nPolicy reform implementation falters because \nof inadequate institutional capacity. \n\nReforms  are  prioritized  and  sequenced, \ninto  account \ninstitutional capacity. TA from ADB and other development partners \nwill build capacity in the ministries engaged in the proposed program. \n\ntaking \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government;  the  MOE; the Ministry  of Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport; the \nMWCPA; and the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n30. \nThe government and the MOE have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anti-corruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that government \nhas completed the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the subprogram. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n31. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $200,000,000 to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 3 of the Sustained Private Sector-Led \nGrowth Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  for  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n2 July 2020 \n\n  Masatsugu Asakawa \n  President \n\n   \n   \n\n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nInclusive socioeconomic development achieved (National Development Plan 2017\u20132036)a \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nBy 2021: \na.

The baseline \nis from the 2013 PEFA Assessment report, which uses the 2011 framework. The PEFA comparison table was used \nto adjust targets to the 2016 framework. \n\nc  This is a leading indicator of increased economic empowerment of women and girls because it measures increased \naccess to services and resources that support their economic empowerment. To the extent possible, the program \ncompletion report will report further details on the early benefits of the targeted measures for women and girls based \non evidence of immediate benefits available at completion reporting stage.  \n\nd  Lack of existing sex-disaggregated data limits the ability to set outcome-level gender baselines and targets. This is \nan indicator of women\u2019s participation in budget processes and a leading indicator of (i) increased targeted budget \nallocation  to  services  for  women  and  girls;  and  (ii)  ultimately  improved  services  for  women  and  girls  in  Fiji.  This \nindicator will be further informed by analysis of the systematic collection of sex-disaggregated data in the budget \nprocess.

The PER analyzed government expenditures during FY2009\u2013FY2018 \n\nto assess consistency with policy priorities. This aggregate PER was a first step and a detailed education sector PER is now underway. \n\nb   The PEFA gender responsive public financial management self-assessment was done as one of the seven pilot countries chosen to trial the new framework, which \n\nwas launched in January 2020. The PEFA Secretariat approved the self-assessment by issuing a \u2018PEFA Check\u2019. \n\nc   The budget reporting and monitoring module and the business intelligence tool form phase one of the approved recommendations from the FMIS report approved \n\nby the Minister.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n24 \n \n \nd   18 out of 20 women directors and senior management have improved capacity in ensuring SOE compliance with Public Enterprises Act 2019. \ne   Air Pacific Limited (trading as Fiji Airways), Airports Fiji Limited, and Fiji Ports Corporation Limited in particular offer essential services in air and maritime transport. \nf   All Bills that are tabled in Parliament will undergo a validation by the Parliament Standing Committee with jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the Bill, including \n\ngender analysis. \n\ng   These commitments are provisions that the World Trade Organization member will implement after a transitional period following the entry into force of the Trade \nFacilitation  Agreement  The  five  commitments  completed are:  Article  1.3  Enquiry  Points;  Article  1.4  Notification;  Article  3  Advance  Rulings;  Article  7.7  Trade \nFacilitation Measures for Authorized Operators; and Article 10.3 Use of International Standards. \n\nh   The Personal Property Securities Act enables lenders to accept movable assets as security for loans more easily, cheaply, and securely. This particularly benefits \n\nwomen owned businesses who are less likely to have fixed assets (such as land). \n\ni   Additional contributions were made to the Credit Guarantee Scheme and Natural Disaster Rehabilitation Facility, which makes loans available to banks at very \nlow interest rates to pass on to SMEs impacted by COVID-19 at a capped interest rate. These schemes are administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and are \nparticularly important to provide finance for women-owned SMEs, who are less likely to have capital or insurance to sustain operations. \n\nj   The  Working  Group  is  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation,  and  includes  representatives  of  civil  society  and  women\u2019s  rights \n\norganizations, ADB and UN Women. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 June 2020) \n", "Currency unit \nF$1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Fiji dollar (F$) \n$0.460 \nF$2.172 \n", "ADB \nAIIB \nCOVID-19 \nFMIS \nGDP \nGRB \nIMF \nMOE \nMWCPA \nPEFA \nPFM \nPPP \nPPPF \nSME \nSOE \nTA \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank \ncoronavirus disease \nfinancial management information system \ngross domestic product \ngender-responsive budgeting \nInternational Monetary Fund \nMinistry of Economy \nMinistry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability \npublic financial management \npublic\u2013private partnership \npost-program partnership framework \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  Fiji  ends  on  31  July.  \u201cFY\u201d  before  a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2020 ends \non 31 July 2020. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General  Leah Gutierrez, Pacific Department (PARD) \nDirector \n", "Ahmed M.
