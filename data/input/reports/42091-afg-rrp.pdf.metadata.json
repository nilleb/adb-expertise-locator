The \nInvestment  Program  has  an  environmental  assessment  and \nreview \nimpact \nframework  and  cumulative  environmental \nassessment.  Each  project  under  the  MFF  will  have  individual \nsafeguard  documents  as  required  by  ADB.  The  first  tranche  had \nan \nis  classified  as \nenvironmental category B according to ADB guidelines. \n \nThe Investment Program is consistent with the Afghanistan National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS),  which  was  approved  in  April  2009 \nand constitutes the country\u2019s strategic platform for development for \n2008\u20132020.  Its  aim  is  to  promote  growth,  generate  wealth,  and \nreduce poverty  and  vulnerability.  ANDS covers  all key sectors and \nsubsectors,  and  embraces  several  themes.  Water  resources  is  a \nmajor  sector  under  ANDS,  which  provides  a  programmatic \napproach  to  developing  the  water  sector  that  includes  (i)  physical \ninvestments  in  rehabilitation  of  existing  and  development  of  new \nwater  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  nonphysical \ninvestment in capacity building, strengthened institutions, and policy \nframeworks. The  proposed  MFF  finances the  medium-term  portion \nof  a  broader  investment  program.  The  Investment  Program  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Afghanistan  country  partnership  strategy \n(CPS)  2009\u20132013, \nframework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020), and water policy Water for All. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  finance  (i)  the  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading  of  existing  and  development  of  new  irrigation  and  water \nresources  infrastructure,  (ii)  flood  management  infrastructure,  (iii) \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for  key  staff \nthroughout \nfour \ncomponents: (i) northern basins development (NBD) that includes \n\ntranche  project  has \n\nlong-term  strategic \n\nthe  sector.  The \n\nfirst \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nMFF Modality \n\n \nRationale \n\nthat \n\n(NVDA) \n\nirrigation \n\nimprovement \n\ninfrastructure,  and \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \ndevelopment  of  a  river  basin  agency  (RBA)  and  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) for water management; (ii) Nangahar Valley \nDevelopment  Authority \nincludes \nirrigation rehabilitation and upgrading, development of WUAs, and \na management reform plan for the NVDA; (iii) flood management \nthat includes development of flood protection infrastructure along \nthe  Amu  Darya  River  and  development  of  a  national  flood \nmanagement program; and (iv) project management and program \ndevelopment  that  includes  a  program  development  facility  to \nprepare the subsequent two tranches of the MFF. \n \nThe MFF is proposed as the modality to extend ADB financing to \nthe Investment Program for the following reasons: \n \n(i) \n\nIt provides flexibility to the authorities and ADB. Within the \nproposed maximum financing of $303.3 million equivalent, \nADB  and  the  Government  can  modify  the  amount  and \ntiming of contributions under each tranche. \nFinancing is aligned with project readiness. \nThe MFF allows ADB to enter into a long-term partnership, \nthereby  creating  a  stable  financing  plan  and  platform  for \nsector  development.  It  provides  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments. \nA program loan would help improve policies but not capital \ninvestments. An MFF allows ADB and the Government to \nshift  time  and  resources  away  from  repetitive  processing \ntasks into implementation work.  \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nADB  will  provide  grants  to  finance  projects  under  the  MFF  when \nthe  projects  are  ready  for  financing,  and  upon  submission  of  a \nsatisfactory  periodic  financing  request  (PFR).  Each  grant  will \nconstitute a tranche and may carry financing terms different from \nthe  terms  of  previous  or  later  tranches.  The  choice  of  financing \nterms  will  depend  on  the  project  and  ADB\u2019s  financing  policies  at \nthe  time  the  grant  is  made.  Tranches  may  be  provided  in \nsequence or simultaneously, and may overlap. \n \nThe  projects  corresponding  to  individual  tranches  may  comprise \nprojects, subprojects, their subcomponents, and/or other physical \nand nonphysical components of the Investment Program. \n \nAll the necessary conditions for the use of an MFF are in place: a \nstrategic framework, a  policy framework, an investment program, \nand a tentative financing plan. \n \nWater  resources  in  Afghanistan.  Sound  management  and \ndevelopment  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  water  resources  are  essential  for \nsustained economic growth. Afghanistan is arid, and precipitation \nvaries substantially both geographically and over the course of the \nyear, with most precipitation falling between November and April. \nThe  seasonal  precipitation  pattern  leads  to  annual  flooding;  this \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto \n\nImproved  access \n\ncauses  significant  economic  losses  in  some  areas,  but  also \nprovides  potential  opportunities.  Harnessing  available  water \nresources  where  and  when  they  occur\u2014and  exploiting  these \nresources  most  efficiently  for  irrigated  agriculture  and  other \nuses\u2014are key challenges. \n \nAgricultural  economy.  Agriculture  employs  about  two  thirds  of \nthe  population  and  comprises  up  to  half  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product.  However,  agricultural  production  fluctuates \nyearly  because  of  climatic  conditions,  and  irrigation  is  necessary \nin most areas for reliable agriculture. Irrigated agriculture accounts \nfor  about  80%  of  crop  production.  Almost  85%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \ninhabitants  live  in  rural  areas,  and  are  either  directly  or  indirectly \ndependent  on  agriculture. \nis \nirrigation \nnecessary for rural economic growth and improved livelihoods. \n \nIrrigation  sector.  Afghanistan  has  approximately  6.5  million \nhectares (ha) of arable land. By the mid-1970s, over 3 million ha \nreceived  irrigation,  and  irrigation  uses  95%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \ndeveloped  water  supplies.  Today,  1.8  million  ha  have  regular \nirrigation. About 80% of irrigated lands have been developed and \nmanaged by local communities in river valleys, and these systems \nare  old  and  degraded.  Improving  the  performance  of  these \nexisting  traditional  irrigation  systems  is  necessary  to  boost \nagricultural production.  \n \nModern  irrigation  systems  under  state  control  were  developed \nwith foreign aid over the last 50 years. The NVDA near Jalalabad \nwas  established  by  the  former  Soviet  Union  under  a  collective \nfarm model. It is currently operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, \nIrrigation,  and  Livestock  (MAIL).  The  systems  support  perennial \nirrigation on 20,000 ha of prime agricultural land, of which 12,000 \nha are privately owned, with most of the remainder on short-term \nleases  to  small  farmers.  All  physical  aspects  of  the  irrigation \nsystem  need  rehabilitation.  The  Government  also  needs  support \nto  develop  a  business  plan  to  restructure  NVDA  (currently  an \ninefficient state enterprise) and increase its corporate orientation. \n \nSeasonal  flooding.  In  many  areas,  annual  flooding  and  bank \nerosion  results  in  damage  to  irrigation  systems  and  the  loss  of \nprime agricultural land, rural infrastructure, and other assets. This \nproblem  is  particularly  acute  in  the  upper  Amu  Darya  River  that \nborders  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan.  ADB  is  implementing  the \nPyanj  River  Basin  Flood  Management  Project  to  address  flood \nissues,  but \nto  remedy \nproblems,  and  Afghanistan  currently  has  little  flood  management \ncapacity.  \n \n\ninfrastructure \n\nis  needed \n\ninvestment \n\n \nProgram Investment Plan  ANDS  proposed  an  investment  program  for  $3,761  million  for  the \nentire  water  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  has \nrevised  the  ANDS  investment  plan  to  $2,468  million  over  the \nmedium-term  under  the  national  programs  for  irrigation  and  water \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nresources  management  that  include:  (i)  Institutional  Set-Up  and \nCapacity  Building  Program,  (ii)  Water  Resource  Infrastructure \nManagement  Program,  (iii)  Bank  Protection  Program,  and  (iv) \nNational  Water  Resources  Development  Program.  The \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  water \nsector investment program and to support it over 10 years through \nan  MFF  (Table  1).  The  amount  proposed  is  up  to  $303.3  million \nequivalent.  A  set  of  investments  has  been  and  will  be  prepared \nunder  the  ADB  Investment  Program.  The  investments  will  be \nfinanced  in  three  tranches,  with  the  first  tranche  totaling  $92.8 \nmillion inclusive of in-kind support for operations and maintenance \nfrom project beneficiaries. Table 2 provides estimates for each of \nthe  first-tranche  components.

Tranche \n1  will  involve  cofinancing  of  $3.3  million  equivalent  from  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom (to be administered by ADB). \nADB  financing  will  be  provided  as  grants  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  in  accordance  with  relevant  ADB  policies, \nsubject  to  modifications  that  may  be  included  under  individual \nfinancing  agreements.  The  implementation  period  will  be  10 \nyears. The Investment Program will consist of individual tranches, \nthe  terms  of  which  may  vary.  The  MFF  will  finance  civil  works, \nequipment and goods, consulting services, and recurrent costs. \n \nThe Government will submit a PFR for each tranche, which will be \nreviewed  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement (FFA) and ADB's then-prevailing policies. If approved, \nfinancing  will  be  provided  from  the  MFF.  The  Government  has \nsubmitted the first PFR, requesting $89.9 million to help finance the \ntranche 1 project. The terms and conditions for subsequent tranches \nwill be subject to (i) the availability of ADB Special Funds resources; \n(ii)  Afghanistan\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nGraduation  Policy  and  Asian  Development  Fund  donor \nrequirements;  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  ADB  Special  Funds \nresources  to  Afghanistan  pursuant  to  then-applicable  policies \nconcerning allocation of, and eligibility for, such funds.

Afghanistan  is  expected  to  submit  the  last \nPFR no later than 31 December 2016. \n \nIn addition, as a part of the proposed MFF amount, the Government \nof  the  United  Kingdom  will  provide  a  grant  in  the  amount  of  $3.3 \nfor  a  Helmand  Basin  Water \nmillion  equivalent \nResources  Master  Plan  under  the  Investment  Program.  The \nfinancing plan for tranche 1 is in Table 4.

ADB's  administration  of  such \ncofinancing  from  time  to  time  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  for \ninformation annually. \n \nUntil 22 September 2019  \n \n22 March 2019 \n\n\fInvestment Program \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for \nthe Investment Program. \n \nThe implementing agencies for the first tranche will be MEW and \nMAIL  (the  latter  for  activities  involving  the  NVDA).  A  program \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  MEW  minister  will \nprovide  oversight  and  policy  guidance  for  the  program.  Two \ndedicated project management offices (PMOs) will be established. \nThe  first  PMO  will  be  located  in  Kabul  to  support  the  flood \nmanagement  and  northern  basins  development  components  with \ncentralized  services  for  safeguards,  financial  management  and \nadministration.  Two  project  implementation  offices  (PIOs)  will  be \nestablished, one in Taloqan and one in Mazar-i-Sharif, to support \nthe technical field implementation. A program development facility \n(PDF) to prepare new tranches of the MFF will be housed in the \nMEW PMO in Kabul. The second PMO for the NVDA component \nunder  MAIL  will  be  located  in  Jalalabad  with  a  liaison  office  in \nKabul.  The  PMOs  will  include  specialist  teams  providing  support \non  technical,  legal,  finance  and  administration,  safeguards  and \ngender,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  and  capacity  and \ninstitutional  development  issues.

The design \nand monitoring frameworks are in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nSound  management  and  development  of  water  resources  are  vital  for  Afghanistan's \nsustained  economic  growth,  particularly  in  the  agricultural  sector.  However,  30  years  of  civil \nunrest  have  severely  degraded  the  country\u2019s  water  resources  infrastructure,  and  the  capacity \nand  institutions  to  manage  and  develop  that  infrastructure.  This  has  devastated  both  the \nproductivity  of  the  agricultural  sector,  and  the  rural  livelihoods  and  communities  that  depend \nupon it (the Problem Tree Analysis is in Appendix 2). \n \nThe  Government  of  Afghanistan  is  addressing  this  situation  through  the  Afghanistan \n3. \nNational  Development  Strategy  (ANDS).1 The  ANDS  lays  out  the  Government's  development \nagenda  under  three  pillars:  (i)  security;  (ii)  governance,  rule  of  law  and  human  rights;  and  (iii) \neconomic  and  social  development.  The  ANDS  notes  that  water  plays  a  key  role  in  economic \ndevelopment,  but  there  has  been  underinvestment  in  the  sector  to  date.  The  ANDS  gives  the \nhighest  priority  to  water,  and  its  water  sector  development  program  includes  a  mix  of \ninvestments  in  infrastructure,  policy,  institutions,  and  capacity  to  achieve  sustainable  sector \ngrowth.  The  ANDS  provides  a  solid  framework  to  develop  the  water  resources  sector,  but \nrealizing  this  will  take  substantial  commitment  and  investment  (the  sector  analysis,  strategy, \nroad map, and investment plan are in Appendix 3). \n \n4. \nWater  resources  in  Afghanistan.  Much  of  Afghanistan  is  arid,  and  effective  water \nresources management has always been a significant national concern. However, Afghanistan\u2019s \noverall water resources endowment is respectable\u2014precipitation is about 165,000 million cubic \nmeters (m3) per year, with yearly runoff of 57,000 million m3, equal to about 2,280 m3 per capita. \nHowever,  precipitation  varies  geographically\u2014averaging  about  250  millimeters  across  most  of \nthe country, with as little as 75 millimeters falling in the southwest, and reaching 1,170 mm in \nthe  northeast\u2014as  well  as  seasonally,  with  most  falling  between  November  and  May.  Thus \nalthough  much  of  Afghanistan  does  not  receive  adequate  precipitation  for  effective  rainfed \nagriculture, some parts of Afghanistan are prone to seasonal flooding due to runoff.2 \n \n5. \nAgricultural  economy.  Agriculture  employs  about  two  thirds  of  the  population  and \ncomprises  up  to  half  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product,  but  the  contribution  varies \nconsiderably with yearly climatic conditions (it equaled 53% in 2007, but was only 36% in 2004\u2013\n2005).  The  seasonal  variability  and  overall  arid  climate  makes  irrigation  necessary  in  most \n                                                 \n1  Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  In  addition,  80%  of  Afghanistan's  water  resources  are  comprised  of  snow  and  ice  at  elevations  above  2,000 \nmeters, and are sensitive to cycles of drought. This poses water resource management challenges with regard to \nclimate change. Improving water management for increased efficiency and development of infrastructure will help \nmitigate the threats posed by climate change. In addition, ADB's Central and West Asia Department is addressing \nclimate change for its clients through ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change Interventions \nin Central and West Asia. Manila (TA 7274-REG). \n\n\f2 \n\nareas for reliable agriculture, and irrigated agriculture accounts for about 80% of all agricultural \nproduction. Almost 85% of Afghanistan\u2019s inhabitants live in rural areas and are either directly or \nindirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.3 To achieve the Government\u2019s poverty-\nreduction goals, economic growth has to be supported by a sustained increase of 5% to 8% per \nyear  in  the  agricultural  sector.  Development  of  the  agricultural  sector,  which  will  require \nimproved  access  to  irrigation,  is  essential  for  economic  growth,  enhanced  livelihoods,  and \npoverty reduction. \n \nIrrigation.  Irrigation  uses  95%  of Afghanistan's  developed  water  supplies,  and  there  is \n6. \napproximately 6.5 million hectares (ha) of arable land in Afghanistan. By the mid-1970s, an area \nof  about  3  million  ha  received  some  form  of  irrigation.  Today,  about  1.8  million  ha  receives \nirrigation  due  to  the serious  deterioration  of irrigation  systems  from  (i)  civil  unrest and  war,  (ii) \nfloods, (iii) prolonged droughts, (iv) the breakdown of institutions responsible for their operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  and  management,  and  (v)  a  lack  of  resources  for  O&M  and \nrehabilitation. The vast majority (about 80%) of irrigation systems are traditional, and have been \ndeveloped and managed by local communities over the last several centuries.4 These systems \nrely on technically simple distribution structures, and the river intakes in particular are prone to \ndestruction  from  annual  floods,  and  require  regular  rebuilding.  In  spite  of  their  technical \nsimplicity, a robust traditional management institution exists under the oversight of mirabs5, with \nactive community participation developed over the years to manage the systems. Strengthening \nand transforming the traditional mirab management system that has eroded in recent years into \nlegal water users associations (WUAs), while in parallel providing rehabilitation and upgrading \nfor  irrigation  infrastructure,  is  a  key  challenge  to  improving  the  productivity  of  irrigated \nagriculture. \n \n7. \nModern  irrigation  systems  under  state  control  (i)  were  developed  with  foreign  aid  over \nthe last 50 years, (ii) comprise up to 15% of all irrigated area, (iii) support rural livelihoods, and \n(iv)  and  are  in  need  of  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  and  management  reform.  The  Nangahar \nValley Development Authority (NVDA) near Jalalabad was built with assistance from the former \nSoviet  Union  under  a  collective  farm  model.  It  is  currently  operated  by  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Irrigation,  and  Livestock  (MAIL).  The  system\u2014which  has  about  20,000  ha  of \nirrigated  land  with  a  perennial  supply  of  water,  fertile  farmland,  and  an  excellent  agricultural \nclimate\u2014is close to markets. About 12,000 ha is privately held and the rest is mainly leased by \nNVDA  to  small  farmers  on  an  annual  basis  for  a  single  crop  of  wheat,  which  represents  a \nsignificant  underutilization  of  these  assets.  All  physical  aspects  of  the  irrigation  system  need \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading.  MAIL  also  needs  assistance  to  develop  a  business  plan  to \nrestructure  NVDA  on  a  corporate  basis,  with  the  goals  of  using  MAIL\u2019s  existing  assets  more \nproductively, and providing sustainable O&M and management of the irrigation system.6 \n \n8. \nFlooding. In many areas, seasonal flooding and bank erosion cause annual damage to \nirrigation  systems  and  the  loss  of  agricultural  land,  rural  infrastructure,  and  other  assets.  The \nproblems  are  particularly  acute  in  the  upper  Amu  Darya  river,  which  form  the  border  between \nAfghanistan  and  Tajikistan.  The  Afghan  side  of  the  border  features  many  low-lying,  populated \nareas as the river flows into the flood plain from the mountains. The soil is soft and productive \n\n                                                 \n3 Afghan  farmers  also  need  substantial  support  relating  to  agricultural  support  services  and  marketing  in  order  to \n\n4 Although developed using basic technology, some of these individual system irrigate more than 10,000 ha. \n5 Mirabs  are  responsible  for  management  and  organization  of  community  O&M  of  the  systems  and  serve  at  the \n\noptimize returns. \n\nrequest of the community.  \n\n6 Assets associated with the NVDA include the irrigation system and land, a machine shop and motorpool, an olive oil \n\nprocessing plant, buildings, marketing facilities, nurseries and research plots, and residences. \n\n\falong the Afghan bank, but few flood protection works have been built. Banks erode regularly, \nespecially during the spring and summer flood season, and numerous villages and up to 10,000 \nha  of  land  has  been  lost  over  the  last  20  years.  ADB  is  implementing  the  Pyanj  River  Basin \nFlood Management Project regional technical assistance (TA)7 project to improve the ability of \nboth  countries  to  address  flood  issues.  However,  infrastructure  investment  is  also  needed  for \nflood  management  throughout  the  country.  Currently,  Afghanistan  has  little  capacity  or  formal \norganization to address flood management. \n \nPolicy  and  institutional  framework.  Afghanistan's  policy  framework  related  to  water \n9. \nresources is well designed, but support is needed to build capacity and effective institutions for \nthe framework\u2019s implementation. The new Water Law8 is based on best practice for integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM)  and  establishes  the  overarching  sector  framework. 9 \nUnder  the  law,  river  basin  agencies  (RBAs)  and  river  basin  councils  (RBCs)  have  been \nestablished as a decentralized management structure under the Ministry of Energy and Water \n(MEW), which is responsible for development of infrastructure and overall management of water \nresources. 10  MEW's  capacity  has  improved  with  regard  to  basic  engineering  and  project \nmanagement,  but  MEW  still  requires  significant  support  to  fulfill  its  mandate,  especially  at  the \nregional level. The transition to RBAs and RBCs will require the development of new skills.  \n \n10.  MEW is the lead ministry for water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan, but MAIL has \nresponsibility  for  small-scale  irrigation  and  on-farm  water  management.  MAIL  has  very  limited \ncapacity  for  irrigation  but  has  drafted  an  irrigation  sector  strategy  for  its  own  programs.11 Its \nemphasis is on water harvesting and on-farm water management, with the latter vital to achieve \nthe maximum productivity from the rehabilitation and upgrading of the irrigation system. Donors \nare working with MAIL to develop its capacity, and MAIL will play an increasingly important role \nin irrigated agriculture. \n \nB.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nThe water sector faces tremendous physical and nonphysical challenges that need to be \n\n \n11. \naddressed in an integrated and sustained way to develop the sector.  \n \n\na. \n\nPhysical Challenges \n\n \n12.  Water  resources  availability.  On  an  average  per  capita  basis,  the  precipitation  that \nAfghanistan receives should be sufficient to prevent water scarcity. However, surface water runoff \nis highly seasonal and very unevenly distributed. Over half of Afghanistan's water runoff flows into \nAmu  Darya  River,  much  of  it  in  the  form  of  floods;  this  water  is  challenging  and  expensive  to \ncapture, and located far from population and economic growth centers. \n \n13. \nTransboundary considerations. Over 95% of Afghanistan's water resources are in rivers \nthat flow into neighboring countries. This makes development of water resources more challenging, \nbecause coordination and agreements with riparian neighbors are often needed for development. \n \n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  and  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the \n\nPyanj River Basin Flood Management Project. Manila (TA 6452-REG). \n\n8  Signed by the President on 30 April 2009. \n9  The implementing rules and regulations for the water law are currently being drafted. \n10 The river basin agencies will replace the current provincial setup for MEW regional operations.  \n11 NVDA is an exception to MAIL's normal operations.  \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nDegraded \n\ninfrastructure.  Existing  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure  in \n14. \nAfghanistan  has  received  inadequate  O&M  over  the  last  30  years  and  is  extremely  degraded. \nSignificant rehabilitation and upgrading investment is required to restore existing infrastructure to its \nproductive potential. \n \n15. \nLack  of  new  infrastructure.  Although  Afghanistan  has  water  that  it  can  harness  for \nproductive purposes, it has not invested in new water resources and irrigation infrastructure over \nthe  last  few  decades.  Substantial  investment  is  needed  to  help  Afghanistan  bridge  the  gap \nresulting from 30 years of stagnated economic development. \n \n16. \nInefficient  water  resources  management. Most irrigation in Afghanistan uses traditional \nsystems that are not engineered, are constructed from rudimentary materials, and have degraded \nover  the  last  few  decades,  resulting  in  low  irrigation  efficiency.  The  lack  of  investment  in  new \ninfrastructure has also hampered water user efficiency. On-farm irrigation and water management \nneed  to  be  improved,  and  would  benefit  significantly  from  training  and  the  introduction  of  more \nefficient irrigation technologies and management practices.  \n \n\nb. \n\nNonphysical Challenges \n\n \n17. \nLack  of  qualified  staff.  The  decades  of  conflict  and  inactivity  have  seriously  affected \nMEW,  which  has  few  staff  that  can  contribute  to  water  sector  development.  Capacity  building \nefforts by ADB, the World Bank, and other donors have resulted in improvements, but additional \neffort  is  required  to  enable  MEW  to  manage  and  develop  the  water  sector  without  external \nassistance.  In  addition  to  solidifying  basic  technical  and  project  management  capacity,  new \nskills will be required for the RBAs and RBCs to become functional. The current salaries of MEW \nengineers are far below market rates, inhibiting retention of staff. The situation is unlikely to change \nin  the  short-  to  medium-term,  and  the  amount  and  duration  of  support  needed  during  project \nimplementation exceeds the norm. \n \n18. \nFeasibility studies and investment plan. Significant work is being undertaken by ADB, \nthe European Commission, and the World Bank to rehabilitate and upgrade irrigation systems \nthroughout  Afghanistan,  but  little  investment  is  taking  place  to  develop  new  water  resources \ninfrastructure.  Although  potential  new  projects  exist,  investment  is  constrained  by  a  lack  of \nquality  feasibility  studies  to  support  the  realization  of  new  projects  and  serve  as  a  basis  for \nprioritizing  investments.  MEW  contracted  the  preparation  of  new  feasibility  studies  to  regional \nfirms,  but  many  of  the  studies  need  additional  work  on  technical  options,  economics, \nsafeguards, and other issues to bring them to an international standard that would support ADB \ninvestments. ADB initiated support to MEW to remedy this situation under technical assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Development for Irrigation and Water Resources,12  but additional support is \nneeded. \n \n19.  MEW has a list of priority investments, but it is not fully supported by objective selection \ncriteria or adequate project information. However, even with good feasibility studies, analysis is \nrequired to prioritize and sequence projects, especially in a river basin context, where upstream \ndevelopments can impact downstream projects. The World Bank has initiated modeling efforts \nin the Kabul River Basin to evaluate different development options and scenarios in optimizing a \ndevelopment  plan.  Additional  work  is  required  and  is  ongoing  to  (i)  develop  better  feasibility \nstudies  to  support  investment,  and  (ii)  prioritize  and  sequence  investments  as  the  basis  of  a \ncomprehensive sector investment plan. \n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  Capacity  Development  for  Irrigation \n\nand Water Resources. Manila (TA 4716-AFG). \n\n\fLack of water resources knowledge base. Good quality data are required for effective \n20. \nwater  management  and  rehabilitation,  upgrading  and  development  of  water  resources  and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  A  severe  lack  of  most  data  (e.g.,  surface  and  groundwater  data, \nmeteorological  data,  geotechnical  information,  agricultural  data,  and  water  quality  data) \nconstrains  effective  planning  and  management.  Monitoring  capability  is  limited  by  a  lack  of \ntechnical  resources,  as  well  as  human  capacity  to  manage  data  collection  and  analysis.    An \nintensive  effort  is  needed  to  ensure  that  sector  development  is  not  supported  by  project \ndevelopment  in  isolation,  and  that  measurement  and  monitoring  systems  and  the  institutions \nand capacity to use them effectively are also put in place. \n \n21. \nOperation and maintenance of infrastructure. The Government has limited funds and \ncapacity  for  O&M  of  large  irrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure.  Donor  funds  and \nGovernment general revenues can be used in the short term for recurrent costs, but a longer-\nterm solution is required. Under the Water Law, fees can be charged for water delivery, and the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  developing  tariff  strategies  for  O&M  funds  that  stay  within  the \nsector  to  reduce  subsidies  and  achieve  sustainability.  Over  80%  of  irrigation  uses  traditional \nsystems,  and  communities  have  been  responsible  for  O&M  for  hundreds  of  years,  although \ntraditional  management  has  declined  in  recent  years.  Support  is  required  to  build  on  the \ncommunity management and to establish WUAs under the Water Law. O&M is a challenge, but \nopportunities exist to address it on multiple levels. \n \n22. \nOn-farm  water  management  and  agricultural  production.  While  timely  delivery  of \nirrigation  water  is  a  primary  constraint  for  agricultural  production,  other  issues\u2014including  on-\nfarm  water  management,  inputs,  access  to  markets,  and  post-harvest  handling\u2014are  binding \nconstraints  to  agricultural  production.  These  production  factors  are  underdeveloped  in \nAfghanistan, and should be addressed with irrigation to maximize productive impact. \n \n23. \nPoppy  cultivation. Afghanistan currently produces over 90% of the world's opium and \npoppy  production  poses  a  huge  social,  political,  and  security  challenge.  Opportunities  for \nalternative  livelihoods  are  required  in  rural  areas  to  ease  the  reliance  on  the  opium  economy. \nImproved  access  to  irrigation,  especially  for  higher-value  second-season  cropping,  provides \nenhanced incomes and blunts the strong economic incentives to grow poppy. At the same time, \nassurances  are  required  from  communities  receiving  assistance  that  they  will  abstain  from \npoppy production, and government interdiction efforts must pose a credible threat. \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Resources Sector Strategy and Investment Program \n\n \n24. \nThe ANDS and the Government's water sector policy framework provide a clear sector \nstrategy and investment program. The ANDS's water sector vision is \"to manage and develop \nthe  country's  water  resources  so  as  to  reduce  poverty,  increase  sustainable  economic  and \nsocial development, improve the quality of life for all Afghans and ensure an adequate supply of \nwater for future generations.\" 13 Underpinning the ANDS is the national Water Sector Strategy, \nwhich  addresses  all  water  subsectors  including  water  supply,  environment,  and  hydropower. \nBased  on  a  sector  analysis,  the  ANDS  Water  Sector  Strategy  develops  programs  with \nassociated  investments,  which  include  the  following  for  water  resources  and  irrigation:  (i) \nInstitutional Set-Up and Capacity Building Program, (ii) National Water Resources Development \nProgram, (iii) National River Basin Management Program, (iv) Irrigation Rehabilitation Program, \nand  (v)  River  Bank  Protection  Program.  The  most  recent  MEW  investment  plan  based  on  the \nANDS programs is about $2.5 billion over the medium term. In addition to the investments, the \n                                                 \n13 Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan.  2008.  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy:  1387\u20131391  (2008\u20132013). \n\nKabul (page 84). \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nANDS has a Water Sector Strategic Action Plan that outlines policy, institutional, and capacity \ndevelopment  activities  needed  to  achieve  desired  sector  outcomes.  The  programmatic \napproach  of  the  ANDS,  plus  the  existing  legal  and  policy  framework,  including  the  new  Water \nLaw, provide the strategic framework to support sector investment. The ANDS programs, their \nobjectives  and  the  initial  investment  program  provide  a  well-defined  road  map  to  guide  sector \ninvestment.  Refinements are required and are ongoing, and the ADB Investment  Program will \nbe updated as better information becomes available and new projects are prepared. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n\n \nADB's  new  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Afghanistan  (2009\u20132013)14 is  fully \n25. \naligned  with  the  ANDS.  The  CPS  highlights  four  sectors  for  ADB  investments:  (i)  energy,  (ii) \ntransportation and communication, (iii) agriculture and natural resources (including irrigation and \nwater  resources),  and  (iv)  governance.  The  new  strategy  for  the  water  sector  represents  a \ncontinuation  of  the  previous  objectives  from  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006\u2013\n2008).15 However,  investments  and  institutions  are  supported  in  a  more  programmatic  fashion \nthrough the combination of physical and nonphysical investments under the MFF modality. The \nnew  strategy  attaches  special  importance  to  themes,  particularly  gender  and  development, \ncapacity,  and  private  sector  development.  In  addition  to  the  CPS,  the  Investment  Program  is \nfully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020), 16 which \nincludes  investment  in  water  resources  infrastructure  as  a  core  ADB  business  activity.  The \nGovernment's  commitment  to  a  policy  framework  based  on  IWRM  principles  contained  in  the \nWater Law and ANDS is consistent with the ADB water policy, Water for All. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n \n26.  Water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan have received significant attention over the \nlast  6  years  from  multiple  donors,  but  infrastructure  investment  has  been  lower  than  in  other \nsectors  (e.g.,  roads  and  power).  ADB,  the  European  Commission,  and  the  World  Bank  have \nbeen the three largest, most consistent donors to the sector with ongoing programs that began \nin 2002. The European Commission has supported a long-term integrated program in the Amu \nDarya and Kundoz basins featuring infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading and institutional \ndevelopment of the RBAs, RBCs, and WUAs. The World Bank has had an ongoing emergency \nrehabilitation and upgrading program that is working throughout the country. The Untied States \nAgency  for  International  Development  has  had  several  rural  development  and  agricultural \nprograms  with  irrigation  and  water  resources  activities,  but  no  dedicated  water  resources \nprogram.  Other  bilateral  donors  have  supported  the  sector,  including  the  Government  of  India \n(through the construction of Salma Dam) and the Canadian International Development Agency, \nwhich is rehabilitating Dahla Dam. To date, ADB has combined an integrated approach\u2014which \nintegrates physical and nonphysical investments\u2014with a geographic focus on the northern and \nwestern portions of the country. A more complete list of sector assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nADB has significant experience in implementing water resources projects in Afghanistan, \n27. \nand important lessons can be drawn from these and other ADB projects in Afghanistan, as well as \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2007.

Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n\fADB's overall experience in the water resources sector.17 \n \n28. \nSecurity  risks  are  present  in  Afghanistan,  but  can  be  mitigated  with  proper  planning, \ncoordination with local authorities and communities, and adequate resources. Security planning \nand associated costs can be significant, and need to be factored into projects from the outset. \n \n29.  Many projects in Afghanistan are behind schedule and prone to related cost overruns. This \nis a function of security concerns and rising investment costs, in part because initial project costing \nand  actual  contracting  may  be  separated  by  years  due  to  delays  in  consultant  recruitment, \npreparation of feasibility studies and detailed designs, and tendering. The MFF modality will help \nmitigate this problem, because projects should be ready to proceed with contracting at the time a \nperiodic financing request (PFR) is submitted. More effective project management offices (PMOs) \nunder a long-term programmatic MFF approach will also improve planning. \n \n30.  Many  delays  stem  from  project  startup  activities  (e.g.,  establishment  of  the  PMO  and \ntraining  of  PMO  staff,  recruitment  of  implementation  consultants,  establishment  of  financial  and \nproject management systems, and awarding of initial civil works contracts). Projects should have \nbetter  and  more  detailed  implementation  plans,  and  project  implementation  manuals  at  the \noutset.  Effective  use  of  TA  funds  to  advance  project  readiness  beyond  normal  processing \nstandards,  assiduous  support  from  the  resident  mission,  and  additional  support  from  ADB \nheadquarters is required, especially in weakly performing countries such as Afghanistan. This will \nbe facilitated by the  joint venture  approach taken by  the  Afghanistan  Resident  Mission and ADB \nheadquarters. \n \nCapacity  is  weak  across  all  aspects  of  project  preparation  and  management.  Adequate \n31. \nconsulting  input  is  required  to  ensure  that  project  implementation  will  proceed  irrespective  of \ngovernment  counterparts  and  support.  Capacity  development  can  be  undertaken  as  a  parallel \nactivity through a mix of on-the-job experience and more formal in-country and foreign training. As \ncapacity is developed, greater responsibility can be shifted to government counterparts. \n \n32. \nIt  is  very  difficult  to  recruit  and  retain  good  consulting  services  in  Afghanistan,  so  the \nquality-based  selection  (QBS)  procedures  should  be  used  to  secure  qualified  staff.  QBS  also \nfrom  existing  contracts. \nin  replacement  of  consultant  staff \nprovides  greater \nProcurement  is  difficult  and  contractor  capacity  is  weak,  so  contracting  is  more  manageable \nusing  larger  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contracts  rather  than  multiple  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  contracts.  Much  of  the  ICB  work  is  also  subcontracted,  meaning \nnational  contractor  capacity  is  still  developed  in  the  sector  under  the  ICB  modality,  with \nmanagement by the internationally qualified firms. \n \n33.  Water  resources  and  irrigation  projects  are  most  effective  when  the  development  of \ninfrastructure can provide a tangible, catalytic factor to develop management and O&M capacity for \nWUAs  and  government  agencies.  However,  careful  planning  and  adequate  implementation \nresources  are  needed  to  ensure  that  interlinked  physical  and  nonphysical  components  are \nphased  accordingly.  Activities  to  establish  WUAs  and  RBAs  should  be  undertaken  early  in  a \nproject  so  that  they  can  then  actively  engage  in  and  have  ownership  over  the  planning, \nexecution, management and O&M of civil works. \n\nflexibility \n\n                                                 \n17 Previous  ADB  projects  include  the  ADB.  2003.

Outputs will \nalso include PMOs and project implementation offices (PIOs) to ensure efficient development of \ninfrastructure and delivery of services and to provide training for government staff for improved \nproject management. A program development facility (PDF) will be established to prepare new \ntranches of the MFF. \n \n39. \nThe  underlying  approach  to  executing  the  Investment  Program  is  to  develop  projects \nthat integrate physical and nonphysical components to comprehensively and holistically address \nsector  needs  to  achieve  desired  outcomes.  This  approach,  combined  with  long-term  ADB \nengagement  through  the  MFF,  will  provide  the  support  needed  to  sustainably  improve  the \nperformance and accelerate development of the water resources sector in Afghanistan. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  1981.

The  first  tranche  (the  Project)  under  the  Investment  Program  will  have  four \ncomponents:  (i)  northern  basins  development  (NBD),  (ii)  NVDA  improvement,  (iii)  flood \nmanagement, and (iv) project management and program development. Each of these components \nwill have an integrated package of physical and nonphysical outputs. \n \n\na. \n\nComponent 1 \u2013 Northern Basins Development Physical Outputs \n\n \nLarge  infrastructure.  The  Northern  Basins19 is  one  of  the  five  national  RBAs  defined \n41. \nunder  the  Water  Law.  The  NBD  activities  build  from  previous  ADB  projects\u2014the  Emergency \nInfrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP)  20 and  the  Balkh  River  Basin \nIntegrated Water Resources Management Project.21 Tranche 1 will finance infrastructure for water \nresources management and irrigation in the Lower Balkh River Basin (about 80,000\u2013100,000 ha of \nintensive irrigation). This includes construction of the Bangala weir, rehabilitation and upgrading for \nthe Samarkandian weir, and improved operational control for the Samarkandian and Narhi Shahi \nweirs.  This  improved  infrastructure  will  nearly  complete  modernization  of  the  former  traditional \nintakes in the Lower Balkh Basin and provide significantly improved basin-level water management \nand distribution capacity, thereby enabling optimized water allocation and agricultural production. \n \nSmaller  irrigation  infrastructure. The Project will provide rehabilitation and upgrading of \n42. \nabout  250  main  canal  structures,  and  nearly  complete  this  work  in  the  Lower  Balkh  Basin. 22 \nSecondary and tertiary canal structures will be constructed and upgraded on a pilot basis in a WUA \ndevelopment program. Investment in these smaller structures will be scaled-up under the second \ntranche of the Investment Program once WUAs and robust implementation procedures have been \nestablished. \n \n43. \nImproved  canal  access  points  for  women.  The  Project  will  support  development  of \nimproved canal access points for women to do washing and collect water for household use. The \nProject's  gender  specialist  will  work  through  the  WUAs  and  community  development  councils  to \nengage women to identify the best design and locations for access points in the canal network.23 \nThis will be pilot tested in the first tranche to establish a robust implementation modality, and then \nscaled  up  in  later  tranches.  The  gender  specialist  will  also  develop  options  and  a  program  to \nincrease investment in gender-related activities in subsequent tranches of the Investment Program. \n \n\nb. \n\nComponent 1 \u2013 Northern Basins Development Nonphysical Outputs \n\n \n44. \nRiver  basin  management  and  operation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  support \ndevelopment  of  the  Northern  Basin  RBA,  including  training  and  resources  to  monitor,  measure, \nand analyze water flow and other data. Rules to manage and operate the modernized intakes and \n                                                 \n19 The Northern Basins include the Balkh Ab, Khulm, Sari Pul, and Samigan rivers. \n20 ADB.  2003.

(JFPR 9060-AFG). \n\n22 Under  the  EIRRP,  a  participatory  process  of  working  with  the  communities  to  identify  and  confirm  the  irrigation \nsystem improvements  was established. This approach  will be continued under the NBD component. As a part of \nthe process, the communities receiving assistance had to commit that they (i) would abstain from growing poppy, \nand (ii) provide requisite O&M to maintain the improvements. \n\n23 Community development councils were developed as a part of the National Solidarity Program implemented by the \nMinistry  for  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development.  They  still  serve  as  viable  local  government  units  in  most \nvillages. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nweirs on the Balkh River will be developed with water users to take full advantage of the improved \ninfrastructure.  Procedures  will  be  developed  and  RBA  staff  trained  for  effective  O&M  of  the \ninfrastructure under RBA management. The Project will support the RBA and Government in the \ndevelopment  of  mechanisms  for  sustainable  O&M  financing,  including  creation  of  policies  and \nprocedures to assess and collect user fees to supply irrigation water; the work done in this regard \nfor  the  Northern  Basins  should  also  help  in  the  development  of  related  national  policies.  While \nthese procedures are being developed, tranche 1 will provide interim O&M funds for infrastructure \nunder the RBA. \n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  RBA  to  prepare  a  Northern  Basin  water  resources  master \nplan  to  further  develop  the  Northern  Basins.  The  master  plan  will  include  feasibility  studies, \ndetailed designs, and preparation of tender documents for the (i) Imam Sahib intake and main \ncanal structures; (ii) secondary and tertiary structures in the Lower Balkh Basin; and (iii) canal \noff-takes,  irrigation  structures,  and  flood  management  infrastructure  throughout  the  Northern \nBasins, in preparation for financing in the second tranche of the Investment Program. \n \n46.  Water  user  associations  and  river  basin  councils.  The  component  will  mobilize  and \nlegally  establish  WUAs  in  the  Lower  Balkh  Basin  based  on  the  mirab  system.  A  core  technical \ntraining program for WUAs will be developed that includes (i) O&M and minor repairs, (ii) water \ndistribution management, (iii) basic irrigation design and improved structures, (iv) irrigation and \ncrop  scheduling,  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  Under  the  first  tranche,  a  WUA \ndevelopment plan will be prepared for the adjacent basins to be executed in the second tranche \nof the Investment Program. The WUA training will also include (i) a pilot program for WUAs to \nparticipate  in  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  secondary  and  tertiary  structures,  and  (ii) \ndemonstration activities for improved on-farm water management. Under the Water Law, RBCs, \nwhich  are  made  up  of  water  users,  are  tasked  with  determining  water  allocations,  permitting, \nsettling  legal  disputes,  and  helping  to  set  policy  for  their  associated  RBA.  Tranche  1  will  help \nestablish the RBCs; during the second tranche, more intensive capacity development efforts will \nbe undertaken to improve the RBCs\u2019 effectiveness. \n \n\nc. \n\nComponent 2 \u2013 Nangahar Valley Development Authority Improvement \nProject Physical Outputs \n\n \n47. \nSystem  rehabilitation.  This  component  comprises  comprehensive  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading  of  the  irrigation  system  that  includes  repairs  to  the  main  canal  headgate;  desilting; \nimproved protection walls; new headgates on secondary canals; and works on siphons, spillways, \nand  passages  for  drainage  washes.  All  secondary  and  larger  tertiary  canals  will  be  rehabilitated \nand fitted with new improved control structures. These works will be executed on and benefit both \nthe 12,000 ha of privately held land and the 8,000 ha of NVDA land.24 \n \nImproved canal access points for women. The NVDA improvement component will also \n48. \nsupport work with the WUAs and community development councils to develop water access points \nwithin the canal network for women to wash and collect water for household use. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Currently, most NVDA land is leased to small farmers for 1 year, and for a single wheat crop only; no second crop \nis permitted, although  water supplies are adequate. This renders these areas far less productive than  they could \nbe,  and  reduces  livelihoods  below  than  the  private  holdings.  An  important  objective  of  the  proposed  NVDA \nbusiness plan is to identify options to improve the productivity of the leased land. \n\n\fd. \n\nComponent 2 \u2013 Nangahar Valley Development Authority Improvement \nProject Nonphysical Outputs \n\n \n49. \nNVDA reform. Institutional reform of NVDA under a corporatized management structure is \na  key  priority  of  MAIL.  This  component  will  support  preparation  of  an  institutional  reform  and \nbusiness plan with associated adjustment costs for the restructuring of NVDA on a corporate basis. \nAn important  part  of the institutional reform  is creation  of  a  sustainable irrigation service delivery \nagency to manage the main canal and an O&M financing mechanism for the irrigation system. The \nproject will provide interim O&M financing on a declining basis until the new system is put in place. \n \n50.  Water  user  associations.  The  Project  will  mobilize  and  legally  establish  WUAs  on  the \nprivately  managed  lands  and  on  lands  with  leaseholders.  A  training  program  for  WUAs  and \nfarmers will be developed, similar to that under the NBD component. The NVDA WUAs training \nwill  include  demonstration  activities  for  (i)  improved  irrigation  and  agricultural  techniques  for \ngreater productivity and efficiency, and (ii) on-farm water management. These activities will also \nbe made available to NVDA staff or other leaseholders farming the NVDA land. \n \n\ne. \n\nComponent 3 \u2013 Flood Management Physical Outputs \n\n \n51. \nThe Project will construct flood protection works for Yangi Qala town and the Yetim Tapa \nirrigation system in Takhar province along the south bank of the Amu Darya. This will include an \nearthen  embankment  5  kilometer  long  to  protect  the  town  and  irrigation  system  from  major \nflooding. The embankment may be elongated under the second tranche to expand the protected \narea,  depending  on  its  performance,  and  whether  there  are  associated  negative  impacts.  The \nworks will include a permanent gated intake for the Yetim Tapa irrigation canal intake on the Amu \nDarya River to protect 5,000 ha of irrigated area within the system. The Project will include funds \nfor gabions and other quick gestation, low-cost interventions to protect areas along the Amu Darya \nRiver from bank erosion. A limited number of these structures will be developed under tranche 1 \nand their performance will be reviewed for possible expansion during subsequent tranches.  \n \n\nf. \n\nComponent 3 \u2013 Flood Management Nonphysical Outputs \n\n \nThe  flood  management  component  will  (i)  help  establish  a  National  Flood  Management \n52. \nProgram  within  MEW in  Kabul, and  (ii) prepare  additional  flood  management  works for financing \nunder the second tranche. The National Flood Management Program will develop a 5-year plan to \ninitiate the development and build the capacity of the new unit in MEW. Training will be offered to \nthe  new  MEW  flood  management  unit  on  flood  risk  assessment,  flood  mapping,  the  design  of \nvarious flood management structures, and other flood-related topics. This component will support \npreparation of two to four additional flood management structures along the Amu Darya River for \nfinancing under subsequent tranches. \n \n\ng. \n\nComponent 4 \u2013 Project Management and Program Development \n\n \n53. \nUnder the first tranche, project management arrangements will be put in place to ensure \neffective  implementation  and  timely  preparation  of  subsequent  tranches.  A  PMO  will  be \nestablished in Kabul under MEW to provide coordination and support for the NBD and the flood \nmanagement  components.  Two  PIOs  will  be  established\u2014in  Mazar-i-Sharif  and  Taloqan\u2014to \ndirect field activities for these components. A PDF will be established within the Kabul PMO to \nmanage  preparation  of  subsequent  MFF  tranches.  A  dedicated  PMO  will  be  established  in \nJalalabad under MAIL for the NVDA improvement component, and will direct all implementation. \n \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nh. \n\nThe Second and Third Tranches \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n54. \nThe  NBD  program  will  continue  in  tranche  2  with  subsequent  subprojects  prepared \nduring tranche 1. Flood Management will be an ongoing program throughout all tranches with a \nprimary  focus  on  the  Amu  Darya,  possibly  spreading  to  other  regions  in  tranche  3.  This  will \ncontinue ADB's commitment to the north of Afghanistan. An important objective of the second \nand third tranches is to support development of new infrastructure projects for water resources \nand  irrigation.  The  projects  developed  will  in  part  depend  on  the  attractiveness  of  the \ninvestment(s),  however,  the  Investment  Program  will  target  the  Amu  Darya,  Kabul,  and  the \nNorthern River Basins to maintain the geographic focus of the first tranche investments. \n \nC. \n \n55. \nIntegrated  approach  to  sector  development.  The  Investment  Program  has  an \nintegrated  approach  to  water  resources  sector  development  under  a  long-term  program.  It \nincludes  substantial  investment  in  infrastructure,  including  rehabilitation  of  existing  assets  and \ndevelopment  of  new  infrastructure.  The  infrastructure  supports  enhanced  water  management \ncapacity  at  all  levels\u2014including  on-farm,  tertiary  and  secondary  irrigation  canals,  and  large \nworks that promote improved water management on a basin level. The nonphysical investments \nsupport  improved  (i)  water  management  capacity  and  institutions  at  the  (a)  national  level \nthrough  development  of  the  Flood  Management  Program,  and  (b)  at  the  basin  level  through \ndevelopment  of  the  RBAs  and  RBCs;  and  (ii)  water  management  at  the  irrigation  system  and \nfarm  level  through  development  and  strengthening  of  WUAs.  The  10-year  length  of  the \nInvestment Program provides an appropriate time frame to enable the physical and nonphysical \noutputs  to  impact  water  resources  management  and  development  in  a  synergistic  and \ntransformative manner. \n \n56. \nCofinancing  partnerships.  The  Investment  Program  thus  sets  out  a  framework  for \neffective partnerships in assisting Afghanistan with developing its water sector over the medium-\nterm.  Besides  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  (para.  66),  other  development  partners \nmay determine to complement ADB's financing after the Board's approval of the proposed MFF \nthrough cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of cofinancing to be provided by \nall  development  partners  and  administered  by  ADB  (including  the  grant  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom)  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  deducted  from  the \ntotal  MFF  amount  approved  by  the  Board.  Such  cofinancing  may  be  provided  as  grants  or \nloans,  and  may  take  the  form  of  joint  or  parallel  cofinancing.  ADB's  administration  of  such \ncofinancing from time to time will be reported to the Board for information annually.25 \n \n57.  Multitranche  financing  facility  modality.  Use of the MFF to extend ADB financing to \nthe Investment Program is proposed for the following reasons: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe MFF approach provides flexibility to ADB and the Government. ADB and the \nGovernment can modify the amount and timing of ADB contributions under each \ntranche, assuming the proposed financing ceiling of $303.3 million equivalent is \nnot exceeded. Such flexibility is important if the Government can raise financing \nfrom  other  sources,  or  if  the  Government  needs  more  time  to  finalize  specific \nproject packages. In addition, the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely \nlinked  to  the  availability  of  resources  within  ADB,  and  to  full  compliance  with \nwarranties and representations made under the framework financing agreement \n(FFA). \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB, 2008, Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility, Manila.(para. 79)  \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n58. \n \n\n \n\n13\n\nFinancing  under  the  MFF  can  be  aligned  to  specific  technical,  safeguard,  legal, \nand  other  project  selection  criteria. The  authorities  can  make  grant  conversions \nunder  the  MFF  as  and  when  projects  are  ready  for  execution.  This  approach \nfacilitates advance actions and the expedient establishment of administrative and \nimplementation  arrangements.  The  MFF  allows  ADB  and  the  Government  to \nmore  closely  link  financing  to  possible  changes  in  project  costs  bundled  under \neach tranche, which avoids cost overruns. \n\nA  program  loan  would  help  improve  policies  but  not  capital  investments,  which \nare  crucially  needed.  By  channeling  funding  through  an  MFF,  ADB,  and  the \nGovernment can shift time and resources away from repetitive processing tasks \ninto implementation work. \n\nAll  required  conditions  for  the  use  of  an  MFF  are  in  place:  a  strategy  and  road \nmap,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  financing  plan.  The  modality \nalso  moves  the  analytical  work  up  front,  leaving  resources  and  multiple  entry \npoints for ADB and the Government to focus on execution, capacity, and reforms. \nADB and its partners have agreed on decision-making criteria for the provision of \nfinancing,  including  specific  warranties  and  representations,  and  covenants \nleading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n\nStrategy. The strategic framework and road map are sound. The main components \nare provided with desired sector outcomes. \n\nPolicy framework. The policy framework is well developed, but capacity needs to \nbe developed and institutions strengthened to ensure its effective implementation. \n\nInvestment Program. Under the ANDS, the Government prepared a medium-term \ninvestment  plan  for  the  water  sector.  The  current  investment  plan  for  water \nresources  and irrigation calls for investments of $2,468 million.  \n\nInternational  Development  Agency,  Department \n\nFinancing plan. The Government's investment plan has a significant gap between \nfinancing  and  sector  needs.  ADB  is  one  of  the  financiers,  together  with  the \nCanadian \nInternational \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  European  Union,  the  Government  of \nIndia,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  World  Bank \namong others. If financing for the shortfall is not secured, the Investment Program \nwill still continue but at a slower pace. The national budget is not a reliable financing \noption. \n\nfor \n\nThe status of the MFF preconditions is as follows: \n\n \n59.  Weakly performing country status. ADB's approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries  (WPCs)  recognizes  that  WPCs  face  various  development  challenges  in  different \ndegrees,  and  that  existing  ADB  business  processes  sometimes  constrain  effective  operations  in \nWPCs. 26 Afghanistan is considered a WPC because of its conflict status. While the Government is \ncommitted  to  implementing  the  Investment  Program,  there  are  certain  constraints  facing \nAfghanistan, including (i) the need to deliver development projects expediently in multiple and risk \nprone areas that may yield varying economic and financial returns; (ii) difficulty in timely recruitment \nof quality consultants, contractors, and procurement of goods; (iii) limited availability and qualified \n                                                 \n26 ADB.  2007.

Accordingly, \nthe  following  are  areas  in  which  selective  relaxation  of  ADB's  requirements  can  be  considered \nunder the proposed MFF: \n \n\nRates  of  return  on  program  or  project  feasibility  assessments.  Given  the \nconflict  status  of  Afghanistan,  it  should  be  recognized  that  the  financial  and \neconomic  risks  of  investment  projects  under  the  Investment  Program  are  higher \nand that lower returns are possible. \n\nInvolvement of counterparts. Given the limited availability of qualified counterpart \nstaff  in  Afghanistan  as  well  as  security  concern,  ADB  can  consider  alternative \narrangements,  including  requesting  the  Government  to  outsource  the  counterpart \nrequirement. \n\nEligibility  and  modes  of  procurement.  ADB  may  consider  relaxing  its  eligibility \nrules and modes for the procurement of works and goods, as well as engagement \nof consultants in situations where coordination with other development partners is \nrequired,  or  ADB  considers  necessary  and  appropriate \nto  ease  project \nimplementation. \n\nWater Resources Investment Program \n\n \n61.  While  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program  has  been  prepared  and  will  be \ndelivered  using  standard  ADB  business  processes,  future  tranches  under  the  Investment \nProgram could benefit from expedited project processing and approval, as well as relaxation of \nthe  ADB  business  processes  requirements  in  the  areas  mentioned  in  para.  60.  The  exact \nbusiness  processes  and  associated  specific  guidelines  to  be  relaxed  and  expedited,  and  their \napplication to a specific project will be detailed in the related PFR report for a particular tranche. \nRelevant internal approval and consultation will be sought as appropriate in accordance with the \nthen-prevailing ADB policies, rules, and procedures. \n \nD. \n \n62. \nThe ANDS proposed a sector investment plan for $3,761 million for the entire water sector. \nFor  irrigation  and  water  resources  management,  MEW  has  defined  a  revised  investment  plan  of \n$2,468  million  over  the  medium-term  under  the  ANDS  national  programs  that  include:  (i) \nInstitutional  Set-Up  and  Capacity  Building  Program,  (ii)  Water  Resource  Infrastructure \nManagement  Program  (includes  both  the  National  River  Basin  Management  and  Irrigation \nRehabilitation  programs),  (iii)  Bank  Protection  and  Flood  Control  Program,  and  (iv)  National \nWater  Resources  Development  Program  (Table  1). 27  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to \nfinance a portion of this investment plan and to support it over 10 years through an MFF. The \namount  proposed  is  up  to  $303.3  million  equivalent.  A  set  of  initial  investments  has  been \nprepared  under  the  ADB  Investment  Program.  The  investments  will  be  financed  in  three \ntranches,  with  the  first  totaling  $92.8  million.  Table  2  provides  estimates  for  the  first  tranche \ncomponents  (see  Appendix  5  for  detailed  cost  estimates).  Table  3  provides  the  estimates  for \nADB's  Investment  Program  over  the  three  tranches  based  on  the  Government's  investment \nprograms under the ANDS. \n                                                 \n27  The  Government's  investment  plan  provides  ambitious  targets  for  the  medium-term  and  in  particular  for  the \nNational Water Resources Development Program. However, over the long-term, substantially more resources will \nbe required to develop the sector. The Government investment plan will be updated with support from the PDF as \nadditional and more reliable project information becomes available. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Medium-Term Water Resources Sector Investment Program \n($ million) \n \n\nMedium Term \n\n46.0 \n\n Item \nInstitutional Set-Up and Capacity Building Program \nWater Resource Infrastructure Management Program \n(Includes National River Basin Management and \nIrrigation Rehabilitation) \n\n133.0 \n161.0 \n2,128.0 \n2,468.0 \n\nBank Protection and Flood Control Program \nNational Water Resources Development Program \n \nSources: Ministry of Energy and Water, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates for Tranche 1 Program Components  \n($ million) \n \n\nTranche 1 Component \nNorthern Basins Development \nNangahar Valley Development Authority Improvement \nFlood Management \nProgram Development  \nHelmand Basin Waster Resources Master Plan \nTranche 1 Contingency \n \nTotal \nNotes:  \n1.

Tranche 1 will involve cofinancing of $3.3 million equivalent from \nthe  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.  ADB  financing  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources in accordance with relevant ADB policies,28 subject to modification that may be \nincluded  under  individual  financing  agreements.  The  implementation  period  will  be  10  years. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  consist  of  individual  tranches,  the  term  of  which  may  vary.  The \nMFF will finance civil works, equipment and goods, consulting services, and recurrent costs. \n \n64. \nThe Government will submit a PFR for each tranche, which will be reviewed by ADB in \naccordance  with  the  FFA  and  ADB's  then-prevailing  policies.  If  approved,  financing  will  be \nprovided from the MFF. The Government has submitted the first PFR, requesting $89.9 million to \nhelp  finance  the  tranche  1  project.  The  terms  and  conditions  for  subsequent  tranches  will  be \nsubject  to (i) the availability of ADB's  Special  Funds resources; (ii)  Afghanistan\u2019s access to  such \nresources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy 29  and  Asian  Development  Fund  donor \nrequirements; and (iii) the availability of ADB Special Funds resources to Afghanistan pursuant to \nthen-applicable  policies  concerning  allocation  of,  and  eligibility  for,  such  funds.  Adherence  to \nundertakings  made  in  the  FFA  and  individual  tranche  financing  agreement  covenants  will  be \nconditions for financing approval. \n \n65. \nAfghanistan is expected to submit the last PFR no later than 31 December 2016. \n \n66. \nAs a part of the proposed MFF amount, the Government of the United Kingdom will provide \na  grant  in  the  amount  of  $3.3  million  equivalent  to  finance  a  Helmand  Basin  Water  Resources \nMaster Plan under the Investment Program. 30 The financing plan for tranche 1 is in Table 4. Such \ngrant  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis  to  be  administered  by  ADB  subject  to  terms  and \nconditions for ADB administration of grant cofinancing. \n \n\nThe last date for any disbursements under any tranche will be by 22 September 2019. \n\n \n\nTable 4: Financing Plan for Tranche 1 \n\nTranche 1 \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of the United Kingdoma \nGovernment  \nProject participants: in-kind irrigation O&M from farmers \nTranche 1 Total \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n86.6 \n3.3 \n1.0 \n1.9 \n92.8 \n\n% \n93.2 \n3.4 \n1.1 \n2.1 \n100.0 \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nNote: The table includes estimated amounts for import duties and taxes.

The $3.3 million is a tentative cost estimate.   \n\n\f2. \n\nAsian Development Fund Grant  \n\n \n67. \nThe Board approved the policy paper on the revised framework for Asian Development \nFunds grants on 26 September 2007.31 This policy provides that for countries eligible for grant \nassistance, the percentage of financing on a grant basis in a country will be based on its debt-\ndistress classification. Afghanistan is classified as a country with a high risk of debt distress, and \nis eligible to receive 100% grant financing in tranche 1. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Subsequent Tranches \n\n \n68. \nFinancing  may  be  made  available  from  ADB,  provided  the  Investment  Program \ncontinues to be implemented in accordance with the general understandings and expectations \non which the MFF is based, as contained in the FFA. Progress towards achieving the expected \noutcome  and  outputs  set  out  in  the  DMF  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  guided  by  the \nproject  selection  criteria  (Appendix  6).  Furthermore,  compliance  with  the  policy  framework, \nsafeguard  requirements,  social  development  policies,  and  all  other  undertakings  contained  in \nthe FFA will also influence ADB\u2019s decision whether to continue financing individual tranches. \n \n69. \nIf  a  decision  has  to  be  made  during  the  early  stages  of  implementation  of  tranche  1, \nwhen  results  would  most  likely  not  yet  have  been  achieved,  ADB\u2019s  decision  to  process \nadditional financing tranches would be made based on the Government\u2019s level of commitment \nregarding  and  efforts  to  achieve  the  outcome  set  forth  in  the  DMF.  Nonphysical  tasks  agreed \nupon  that  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  outputs  expected  from  the  Investment  Program  (e.g., \nassumptions  and  mitigation  of  risks  in  the  DMF  pertaining  to  the  Government,  such  as \ncounterpart staff, commitments to institutional change, and O&M issues) will be primary factors \nin ADB decisions. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram and Project Management \n\n \n70. \nExecuting agency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be executing agency (EA) for the \nInvestment  Program.

MAIL will be the IA for the NVDA component. \n \n71. \nProject  management  offices.  PMOs  will  be  established  within  both  MEW  and  MAIL \nwithin  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness.  The  MEW  PMO  will  be  located  in  Kabul  and  oversee \nmanagement  of  the  Investment  Program,  including  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  progress  of \nthe overall investment program, and consolidating accounting and reporting on NBD and flood \nmanagement components. The MAIL PMO will be located in Jalalabad and be responsible only \nfor the implementation of the NVDA component in the first tranche and will report to MOF and \nADB.32 Both  PMOs  (under  MEW  and  MAIL)  will  be  headed  by  full-time  program  directors  that \nwill be appointed by their respective agencies within 3 months of grant effectiveness. The PMOs \nwill be supported by teams of full-time specialists with technical and engineering, legal, finance \nand  administration,  safeguards  and  gender,  M&E  and  reporting,  and  capacity  and  institutional \ndevelopment expertise, along with administrative staff. The teams will include counterpart staff \n\n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Funds Grants. Manila. \n32 MAIL will also maintain a small project liaison office in Kabul to facilitate communication and coordination between \nMAIL  and  NVDA  and  between  MAIL  and  MOF.  This  will  be  staffed  by  one  liaison  officer  and  one  financial \nmanagement officer (both appointed within 3 months of grant effectiveness). \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nas  well  as  international  and  national  consultants  to  provide  support  and  ensure  effective \nimplementation (see Appendix 7 for organizational charts). \n \n72. \nProgram development facility. Within 3 months of grant effectiveness, and concurrent \nwith  establishment  of  its  PMO,  MEW  will  establish  a  PDF.  Prior  to  and  in  preparation  for  the \nformal establishment of the PDF, MEW will first appoint a full-time project director for the PDF \nwithin  2  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  and  then  appoint  consultants  and  counterpart  staff  to \nsupport  the  project  director  when  the  PDF  is  established.  The  PDF  will  be  responsible  for  the \nidentification,  screening,  feasibility  preparation,  and  detailed  design  of  the  subsequent \ninvestment  packages  under  the  Investment  Program.33 The  MEW  PMO  will  establish  a  PIO  at \nMazar-i-Sharif to implement the NBD component, and a PIO at Taloqan to implement the flood \nmanagement  component,  both  within  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness. 34  Each  PIO  will  be \nheaded  by  a  full-time  project  director  (appointed  within  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness), \nsupported  by  implementation  consultants  and  counterpart  staff  (appointed  within  4  months  of \ngrant effectiveness). All program and project directors and counterpart staff will serve on a full-\ntime  basis  and  be  competitively  selected  and  remunerated,  free  and  clear  of  any  restrictions \napplicable to Afghanistan\u2019s public servants, and acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n73. \nThe two PMOs and associated PIOs will be responsible for management, execution, and \ncoordination  of  all  activities  under  tranche  1.  Their  responsibilities  include  (i)  recruitment  of \nconsultants;  (ii)  supervision  of  the  implementation  consultants;  (iii)  collection  of  baseline  data \nand  M&E  of  all  activities;  (iv)  safeguards;  (v)  coordinating  with  MEW,  MAIL,  and  concerned \nRBAs,  RBCs,  and  WUAs  to  ensure  progress  is  on  schedule  with  respect  to  institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building; and (vi) financial management. \n \n\n74. \nA program steering committee (PSC) will be formed to oversee the Investment Program \nand  tranche  1  activities.  This  will  be  the  same  committee  that  was  formed  in  June  2007  to \noversee all other ADB-supported water sector activities in Afghanistan. The PSC is chaired by \nthe  MEW  minister;  members  include  representatives  from  MOF,  MEW,  MAIL,  the  Ministry  of \nMines, and the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development. The MEW and MAIL PMOs \nwill serve as the PSC secretariat. The PSC will meet as required for program guidance, but a \nminimum  of  every  6  months  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  review  tranche  1  and  Investment \nProgram performance. \n \n75. \nProject  coordination  office.  MOF  will  establish  a  project  coordination  office  (PCO)  to \nfacilitate coordination among MOF, MEW, and MAIL and to support the PSC as required. The PCO \nwill support the two PMOs and subsequent investment program implementation with regard to (i) \nprogress reporting, (ii) M&E, and (iii) facilitating financial processing requirements within MOF on \nbehalf of PMOs. MOF will appoint a PCO coordination officer and an M&E officer within 4 months \nof grant effectiveness. If consultant support is required, this will be recruited on an individual basis.  \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n33 Two  options  will  be  used  to  screen  and  prepare  new  projects.  In  the  case  of  small-  to  medium-scale  potential \nprojects  located  in  the  NBD  and  flood  management  areas,  the  PIOs  have  been  tasked  to  identify  and  prepare \nadditional projects, including detailed designs. For all other (or for large-scale) investments, the PDF will contract \nthe services of consulting firms or individuals using procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\n34 For the PIO in Mazar-i-Sharif, the existing PIO from the former ADB EIRRP will be retained to carry on the work if \npossible. If this eventuates, appointment of a new PIO will not be necessary. The flood management PIO will be \nlocated  in  Taloqan  where  communications  infrastructure  and  commercial  banking  facilities  are  available,  with  a \nbase established in Yangi Qala to manage construction. \n\n\f2. \n\nSpecific Project Implementation Processes by Component \n\n \n76. \nRehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  main,  secondary,  and  tertiary  canals  of  the  NVDA \nirrigation system and the associated works will be the responsibility of the MAIL PMO, assisted \nby the consulting services for detailed design and construction supervision. The MEW PMO and \nPIOs  (Taloqan  and  Mazar-i-Sharif)  will  be  responsible  for  the  (i)  construction  of  the  (a)  flood \nembankment  and  associated  irrigation  intake  at  Yangi  Qala,  (b)  Bangala  weir,  (c)  250  main \ncanal structures in the Lower Balkh River Basin, and (d) improved canal access points; and (ii) \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  canals  They  will  be  assisted  by \nconsulting  services  covering  both  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  For  the  civil \nworks outlined above (except for those implemented using community participation), the design \nand supervision consultants will be assigned the role of the engineer and will provide (i) design \nservices,  (ii)  contract  document  preparation,  (iii)  support  with  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (iv) \nconstruction  supervision.  Payment  to  civil  works  contractors  will  be  approved  by  the  relevant \nPMO and/or PIO based on certification by the \u201cengineer\u201d.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n77. \nThe Investment Program is scheduled for execution over a 10-year period commencing \nin 2009 and ending in 2019. Management approval of tranches 2 and 3 is targeted for 2013 and \n2015, respectively.35 All physical works and institutional support financed under the MFF will be \ncompleted  by  22  March  2019  at  the  latest,  and  the  final  date  for  any  disbursement  under  the \nMFF is 22 September 2019. \n \nThe  NBD  and  the  flood  management  activities  under  the  initial  tranche  will  be \n78. \nimplemented over a 5-year period commencing in early 2010. Formation and training of WUAs, \ndesign of various works, and the construction of Bangala weir are all scheduled to commence in \nthe first year. The NVDA irrigation system rehabilitation component will be implemented over a \n4-year  period  also  commencing  in  early  2010.  Formation  and  training  of  WUAs,  survey  work, \nand  detailed  design  work  are  necessary  prior  to  award  of  civil  works,  and  construction  will \ncommence midway in the second year and be completed during the fourth year. The physical \nimplementation of tranche 1 will be completed by 31 December 2014. Indicative implementation \nschedules for tranche 1 and the Investment Program are in Appendix 8. \n \n79. \nProject readiness. Preliminary designs or feasibility-level drawings have been prepared \nfor all tranche 1 works to be awarded by ICB. The 204 structures prepared by the EIRRP have \nexisting  designs  and  tender  documents  under  preparation.36 A  design  exists  for  the  Bangala \nweir, but it needs to be updated. Individual consultants for hydrology, hydraulic engineering, and \nprocurement will be hired to advance preparation of the detailed design, tender documents, and \nprocurement  for  the  Bangala  weir  and  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  Samarkandian  weir. \nThe ICB tendering for these activities will be underway prior to the arrival of the MEW PMO and \nPIO implementation consultants, who will evaluate the bids and supervise the construction. For \nall  other  tranche  1  projects,  due  diligence  has  been  performed  to  assess  their  technical, \neconomic, and financial viability. The concurrence of the Government and IAs were obtained for \nall tranche 1 projects. All tranche 1 projects requiring physical investment have been classified \nas category B in terms of resettlement and environmental impact, and category C for indigenous \npeoples.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (EARF),  and  cumulative  impact  assessment  have  been  prepared.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) and short land acquisition and resettlement plan \n                                                 \n35 The PDF has adequate resources to prepare both tranche 2 and tranche 3 investments for subsequent PFRs. \n36 The designs and tender document will be reviewed and confirmed by the implementation consultants. \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(SLARP) for NBD have been prepared. A number of potential projects have been identified for \npreparation in tranche 2. Final due diligence on all subsequent projects will be conducted under \ntranche 1, and tranches 2 and 3 will be fully prepared during the tranche 1. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n80. \nProcurement  of  works  and  goods  to  be  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  ICB  will  be  used  for  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  and  for  civil \nworks that cost more than $2 million. NCB will be used for goods and works above $100,000 and \nbelow the aforementioned ICB thresholds.37 Shopping will be used for goods and works equal to or \nbelow $100,000. With respect to construction activities under tranche 1, civil works packages for (i) \nBangala  weir  and  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  Samarkandian  and  Narhi  Shahi  weirs,  (ii)  the \nYangi  Qala  flood  embankment  and  associated  irrigation  headworks,  (iii)  the  majority  of  the  main \ncanal structures in the Lower Balkh Basin, and (iv) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the NVDA \nirrigation system will be awarded under ICB procedures. Civil works contracts costing less than $2 \nmillion\u2014including  pilot  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  rehabilitation  in  the  Lower  Balkh  Basin, \ndevelopment  of  improved  canal  access  points  for  women,  and  emergency  floodworks  along  the \nAmu Darya\u2014will be awarded using NCB procedures or shopping.38 These smaller works will not \nbe suitable for or of interest to international contractors and adequate national contracting capacity \nexists to complete these works.39 Before commencement of any procurement activity under NCB, \nADB  and  PMO  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  recently  enacted  public  procurement  provisions  to \nensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nThe  pilot  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  rehabilitation  in  the  Lower  Balkh  Basin  and  the \n81. \nimproved  canal  access  points  for  women  may  be  undertaken  using  community  participation \nprocedures with WUAs, providing the cost of the works is $10,000 or less for the initial contract and \nup  to  $30,000  if  the  WUA  has  relevant  experience.  Selection  criteria  for  these  works  have  been \ndeveloped that ensure (i)  they involve  no  safeguard  issues, (ii)  the community  is capable of and \ncommitted  to  ongoing  O&M,  and  (iii)  the  scope  of  work  is  within  their  capacity  to  manage.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 9 and the procurement plan with all annexes including community \ncontracting and national competitive bidding details is in Supplementary Appendix G. In addition, \nprocurement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  future  tranches  of  the  MFF  indicating  the  particular \ncontracts  for  goods,  works  and  consulting  services  required,  proposed  methods  of  procurement, \nand related ADB procedures. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n5. \n \n82. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  are  proposed  for  procurement  of  goods \nand  services  for  projects  financed  through  the  Investment  Program.  The  Government  was \ninformed  that  expenditures  incurred  before  tranche  effectiveness  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive \nfinancing only if procurement, consultant recruitment procedures, and other expenses fully comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. When the tranche \nbecomes effective, up to a maximum of 20% of the proceeds may be used to retroactively finance \neligible expenditures incurred during the 12-month period prior to signing of the relevant financing \nagreement. The Government may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing. In that \n\n                                                 \n37 Any necessary modifications or clarification to NCB procedures will be set forth in the procurement plan. \n38 In order to accelerate contract awards, a limited number of the main canal structures in the lower Balkh Basin may \n\nbe contracted using NCB procedures if the designs and tender documents are prepared. \n\n39 All civil works contracts awarded under international competitive bidding, the first five national competitive bidding \ncontracts, and the first seven community contracting contracts will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval procedures. \n\n\fcase,  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under  advance  contracting  are  concluded  and  the \naward of contract made after the tranche becomes effective. The Government and the EAs have \nbeen  informed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit \nADB to finance any of the proposed projects. \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n83. \nRobust  levels  of  consulting  support  will  be  required  to  ensure  implementation  of  the \nworks under tranche 1 due to (i) the limited project management capacity available in MEW and \nMAIL,  and  (ii)  the  expanding  workloads  in  both  ministries.  Support  will  also  be  required  to \nprepare investments under ensuing tranches of the Investment Program. The PMOs and PIOs \nwill be supported by consulting services to provide detailed design and construction supervision \nfor  tranche  1  works.  Additionally,  the  PDF  and  PIOs  in  Mazar-i-Sharif  and  Taloqan  will  be \nprovided  necessary  consultant  support  to  (i)  identify,  establish  the  feasibility  of,  and  prepare \ndetailed  designs  for  projects  in  ensuing  tranches  of  the  Investment  Program;  (ii)  prepare  a \nmaster  plan  for  water  resources  development  in  the  Northern  Basins;  and  (iii)  establish  a \nNational Flood Management Program within MEW in Kabul. Consultant support will be provided \nto establish and train effective WUAs. Consultant support for the PMOs will be contracted in two \nseparate packages; one for MEW and one for MAIL. The MAIL package will provide 72 person-\nmonths of international and 302 person-months of national consultant services, while the MEW \npackage  will  provide  219  person-months  of  international  and  795  person-months  of  national \nconsultant  input.  Eight  person-months  of  international  and  8  person-months  of  national \nindividual consultant input will be recruited to accelerate project readiness for construction of the \nBangala weir and for rehabilitation and upgrading of the Samarkandian weir. Details regarding \nand the schedule of inputs for consultant services is Appendix 10. Detailed terms of reference \nfor  consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  All  consultants  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Investment  Program,  including  those  under  tranche  1,  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The selection and engagement of the two main packages outlined above will be through \nfirms selected on quality-based selection (QBS) procedures.40 The same applies for firms to be \nrecruited by the PMO to carry out preparation of subsequent tranches under the PDF. The two \nPMOs  may  select  individual  consultants  for  inputs  as  the  situation  requires. 41  The  PMO \nimplementation consultants will recruit the services of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for \n(i)  WUA  training  and  on-farm  water  management  demonstration  activities,  (ii)  assistance  as \nneeded  with  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  SLARP,  and  (iii)  external  monitoring  of \nresettlement  activities.  The  NGOs  will  be  contracted  on  a  competitive  basis  acceptable  to \nADB.42 \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n40 The  QBS  method  is  to  be  used  to  attract  interest  from  qualified  firms, which  tend  to avoid  cost  competition  in  a \nvolatile environment such as Afghanistan. ADB has had numerous experiences in Afghanistan  with substandard \nconsultants being recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method resulting in work of substandard \nquality, implementation delays, and cost overruns. Effective project preparation and implementation in Afghanistan \nis  difficult  and  demands  consultants  of  the  highest  quality.  The  two  primary  implementation  consulting  contracts \nwill be recruited using full technical proposals. The use of full versus simplified technical proposals for subsequent \nrecruitment of firms will depend upon the size of the contract, complexity of the work to be undertaken and other \nrelevant concerns in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n\n41 Recruitment of individual consultant input requires a no-objection from ADB. \n42 Funds  for  the  recruitment  of  NGOs  will  be  included  as  provisional  sums  in  the  contracts  for  the  implementation \n\nconsultants for the MEW and MAIL PMOs.  \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n84. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, the EA, and the IAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe  Investment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of MOF, MEW, and MAIL, as well as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Investment Program. If corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive  practices  are  found,  ADB  will  automatically  cancel  the  MFF  and  the  tranches \nconcerned. This position has been made clear to the Government. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nliquidated \n\nreplenished,  and \n\n \n85. \nTwo  first-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  in  commercial  banks \nacceptable to ADB. One account will be established in Kabul for the use of the MEW PMO, and \none in Jalalabad for the use of the MAIL PMO. Two second-generation imprest accounts will be \nestablished  by  MEW  for  use  by  its  PIOs  and  will  be  located  in  Mazar-i-Sharif  for  the  NBD \ncomponent  and  Taloqan  for  the  flood  management  component.  All  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished,  managed, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed to by the Government of Afghanistan and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the \ntwo first-generation imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures under \nthe grant, or 10% of the total grant amount, whichever is less. The initial amount to be deposited \nin  the  two  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  the  projected \nexpenditure of the PIOs of MEW to be funded from such accounts, or $500,000, which ever is \nless.43 The currency for all accounts will be US dollars. Statements of expenditure procedures \nwill  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest \naccounts for individual payments under $100,000. Grant disbursements for goods and services \nunder  major  civil  works  and  consultant\u2019s  contracts  will  be  made  using  the  direct  payment \nprocedure, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n86. \nSubsequent  PFRs  will  be  mutually  exclusive,  in  that  the  funds  under each  PFR  will  be \ngoverned  by  a  separate  grant  agreement.  The  respective  grant  agreements  will  describe  the \ndetailed disbursement arrangements for a specific PFR. Grant disbursements under subsequent \ntranches of the MFF will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n87. \nThe MEW and MAIL PMOs will prepare and maintain separate accounts for project- and \nprogram-related  expenditures  adequate  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  grant \nproceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred  for  the  project,  and  use  of \ncounterpart funds for project- or program-related expenditures. The two PMOs will consolidate \nand review accounts, and after auditing submit them to MEW or MAIL, and to MOF and ADB. \nProject  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  using \ninternational accounting standards. The audited accounts and audit reports will be submitted to \n\n                                                 \n43 Bank charges associated with the imprest accounts will be financed by ADB. \n\n\fMOF and ADB no later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate. The \naudit reports will include statements verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against statements \nof  expenditure  have  been  used  for  the  purpose  for  which  they  were  provided.  The  imprest \naccounts and statements of expenditures will be audited as a part of the regular audit of project \naccounts,  and  should  have  separate  opinions.  Financial  management  assessments  for  MAIL, \nMEW, MOF, and NVDA were carried out and found that while adequate systems were in place, \ncapacity and execution need strengthening. The PMOs and PIOs include financial management \nconsulting  support  to  (i)  ensure  sound  financial  management  procedures  are  established  and \nexecuted  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  (please  see \nAppendix 11 for the Flow of Investment Program Funds). \n \n88. \nBoth  PMOs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  quarterly  financial,  physical,  and \ninstitutional and capacity development progress reports on their respective program activities,44 \nand  submitting  these  to  MOF,  MEW,  MAIL,  and  ADB.  The  PCO  (MOF)  will  support  and \ncoordinate  this  task  with  the  PMOs.  The  quarterly  reports  are  to  be  submitted  within  1  month \nfollowing the end of the quarter to which they relate.45 \n \n89.  Within  3  months  of  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMOs  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  relating  to  the  components  for  which  each  was  responsible.46 In  addition  to \nquantifying physical progress and monitoring the utilization of grant funds, all reports will include \na progress statement regarding the status and effectiveness of the recently established RBCs \nand RBAs, and the WUAs established and/or strengthened under tranche 1.47 \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n90.  Within  6  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  a  project  performance  management  system \n(PPMS) for tranche 1 activities will be established in each PMO; in the case of the MEW PMO it \nwill have direct links to the PIOs and PDF.48 The M&E program will be prepared in consultation \nwith MOF, MEW, and MAIL as well as concerned RBCs, RBAs, and WUAs. Participatory M&E \ntechniques  will  be  introduced  to  support  the  PPMS  as  a  part  of  the  WUA  and  RBA  activities \nunder  tranche  1,  and  appropriate  capacity  will  be  developed.  A  database  of  key  benchmark \nindicators (among those currently highlighted in the DMF) will be established by the respective \nPMOs and become a part of the PPMS. The key indicators selected will be monitored at least \ntwice per year. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review  \n\n \n91. \nDuring the initial 2 years of tranche 1 implementation, ADB will conduct review missions \nat least twice annually to (i) assess the effectiveness of the implementation arrangements and \npropose  needed  adjustments;  (ii)  monitor  implementation  progress  relative  to  the  agreed \nimplementation schedule, identify constraints to progress, and define an action plan to improve \nimplementation;  (iii)  ensure  that  ADB  safeguards  and  other  conditions  set  out  in  the  grant \nagreement  and  financial  framework  agreement  are  complied  with;  and (iv)  assess preparatory \n\n                                                 \n44 Reports prepared by the MEW PMO  will incorporate reports from the PIOs (Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan) and the \n\nPDF relating to the progress of forward planning and implementation of the overall Investment Program. \n\n45 In addition, the PMOs will prepare other such information and reports relating to both tranche 1 activities and the \n\nInvestment Program in total as ADB may reasonably request. \n\n46 It  is  envisaged  that  the  MAIL  PMO\u2019s  completion  report  will  be  prepared  in  the  fourth  year  of  the  implementation \n\nperiod for tranche 1 activities, and the MEW PMO\u2019s report in the fifth year.  \n\n47 The MAIL PMO\u2019s completion report should also provide full detail regarding the status of restructuring of NVDA and \n\nthe effectiveness of the newly established entities to manage and provide O&M for the main canal. \n\n48 This will be revised and updated upon arrival of the implementation consultants. \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \nA. \n\nwork for subsequent investment packages to avoid delays in submission of subsequent PFRs. \nADB will field a comprehensive midterm review mission for the tranche 1 investment package 2 \nyears  following  grant  effectiveness, which  will  assess  performance,  identify  problems  affecting \nproject  implementation,  and  reach  formal  agreement  with  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  on \nany changes in the scope of work or to implementation arrangements required to address the \nidentified shortfalls. The full terms of reference of the mid-term review mission will be developed \njointly  by  MOF,  MEW,  MAIL,  and  ADB  during  the  second  year  of  implementation.  Prior  to \nfielding the mission, MEW and MAIL will each submit detailed progress reports relative to their \nrespective components. Project review arrangements for subsequent tranches of the Investment \nProgram will be similar to those for tranche 1 activities. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n \n92. \nEconomic  benefits. For the NBD and NVDA components, the principal benefits will be \nincreased  agricultural  production.  More  dependable  water  supply  and  improved  water \nmanagement made possible by infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading and development of \nWUAs  and  RBAs  will  support  expanded  irrigated  areas,  increased  cropping  intensities,  and \nimproved crop yields. For the NBD component, the Project will directly benefit about 84,000 ha \nin the lower Balkh River Basin irrigation systems, and in particular the 39,200 ha within canals \ncontrolled  by  the  Bangala  weir.  About  20,000  ha  will  benefit  from  the  NVDA  improvement \ncomponent. \n \nImpacts will depend on the location of a farm within the irrigation system. The tail areas \n93. \nare  expected  to  benefit  relatively  more  than  the  head  and  middle  reaches,  because  the \nimproved  water  supply  availability  and  reliability  will  be  relatively  greater  in  the  tails.  For  the \nNBD component, an increase of 12.5% in cropped area is expected in the tail reaches and 5% \nto 9% in the head and middle reaches of the Aqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals below the \nBangala  weir.  Yield increases  are  expected  to average  7%  in  the  tail  reaches  of  these  canals \nbut  only  3%  in  the  head  and  5%  in  the  middle  reaches.  The  impacts  arising  from  the \nrehabilitation and upgrading of main canal structures will range from 2% to 5% for increases in \ncropped area, with yield increases of 1% to 2%. These benefits will be realized throughout the \nirrigation system. \n \n94. \nFor private farms in the NVDA areas, increases in cultivated area will vary from only 4% \nin canal head reaches to 10% at the tail end of canals, while average crop yields are expected \nto increase by between 2% and 5%. The overall increase in cropped area will be 7.3%. In the \nstate  farm  areas,  the  cropping  intensity,  which  is  relatively  low,  is  expected  to  increase  by \naround 25%, with a greater diversity of crops than at present, and crop yields will increase by an \naverage of 10%. These changes will be facilitated by improved incentives for farmers that lease \nland on the state farms. \n \n95. \nThe  flood  management  component  will  provide  protection  from  floods  and  erosion  for \nabout 5,000 ha of cultivated land along the south bank of the Amu Darya River at Yangi Qala, \nas well as for the town of Yangi Qala. The embankment along the river and the head regulator \nat  Yetim  Tapa  will  prevent  flood  damage  to  crops,  livestock,  villages  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure. In the areas along the Amu Darya River, the Project will protect households from \nlosses, but will not have a direct impact on the household incomes. \n \n \n\n\fHousehold and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  to  be  (i)  16.9%  for  NBD,  (ii) \n96. \n18.4% for NVDA improvement, and (iii) 20.4% for flood management. The overall project EIRR \nis  18.0%.  These  results  are  robust  to  changes  in  key  variables.  For  the  Project,  the  switching \nvalue for a decrease in benefits is -23% and for an increase in investment costs is +32%. \n \nB. \n \n97. \nThe Project will have a positive impact on household incomes, food security and poverty \nreduction in project areas. The overall demand for farm labor will increase due to the expanded \nirrigated area and increases in cropping intensity. This is expected to amount to about 600,000 \nlabor days per year (5.9 days per ha) for NBD and NVDA combined. The financial impact of the \nproject  on  farm  households  will  vary  by  location.  For  households  in  the  tail  reaches  of  canals \nbelow  the  Bangala  weir,  where  the  Project  will  have  the  greatest  impact,  the  increase  in \nhousehold income for a 1 ha farm will be $93 per year, or 27% of present estimated income. In \nthe head reaches of these canals (where current water supplies are more assured and current \nincomes  higher),  the  expected  increase  is  $172  per  year,  or  8.2%  of  present  income.  The \nimpact  of  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  main  canal  structures  on  household  incomes  is \nexpected to vary from 2.3% ($49) in the head reaches to 6.2% ($21) in the tail reaches. In the \nNVDA subproject area, where current incomes are higher than in the Northern Basins because \nof the greater production of fruit and vegetables, increases in farm household incomes for a 1 \nha farm will be between $406 per year (an increase of 8.6%) in the head reaches and $461 per \nyear (an increase of 21%) in the tail reaches. Many households have small holdings of less than \n1  ha,  and  when  these  are  located  on  head  and  middle  reaches,  the  project  will  enable  some \n(and possibly many) households to move above the poverty line. While the impact on poverty in \nthe tail reaches may be less in absolute terms, it will be larger in relative terms. \n \n98. \nProgram  benefits.  The  economic  and  financial  benefits  of  interventions  under \nsubsequent  tranches  of  the  Investment  Program  should  be  similar  in  scope  and  magnitude  to \nthose  identified  under  the  first  tranche.  Benefits  from  development  of  new  infrastructure  will \nhave the added impact of expanding the production base and providing irrigation to farmers who \nhave never enjoyed this opportunity. An important benefit from the Investment Program is that \nmore  reliable  irrigation,  especially  for  second-season  cropping,  will  encourage  production  of \ndiversified and higher-value crops that provide alternatives to poppy production. Other benefits \nthat are not quantified stem from institutional strengthening and capacity development for RBAs, \nRBCs, and WUAs, which will result in greater water use efficiency and higher productivity. The \nimproved  water  management  and  possible  development  of  water  storage  through  the \nInvestment Program will help support climate change adaptation. \n \nC. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  was \n99. \nprepared  based  on  the  laws  of  Afghanistan  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Operations  Manual 49 and  endorsed  by  the  Government.  The \nLARF has established a process for (i) resettlement categorization of project activities as A, B, \nor  C  based  on  ADB  guidelines;  (ii)  assessment  of  required  resettlement  activities;  (iii) \npreparation  of  any  required  resettlement  plans  or  other  safeguards  documents;  (iv) \ncompensation to affected persons prior to commence of civil works; and (v)  grievance redress \namong other resettlement activities. The safeguards teams in the PMOs will be responsible for \nall  resettlement  activities  and  prepare  any  required  resettlement  plan(s).  The  categorization \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n                                                 \n49 ADB. 2008. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2/BP. Manila. \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nform  and  draft  resettlement  documents  for  subsequent  tranches  will  be  submitted  for  ADB \napproval  with  each  PFR.  The  PMO  and  implementation  consultants  and/or  contractors  will \nupdate resettlement plans during detailed design. Resettlement plans will be implemented only \nafter they have been formally approved by the IA and cleared by ADB. No notice to proceed will \nbe given for civil works until the resettlement plan is fully implemented in the construction area. \nThe PMO will monitor the resettlement plan implementation and report to ADB. In addition, an \nexternal  monitoring  agency  will  be  engaged  by  the  PMO  and  will  have  responsibility  for  (i) \nconfirming  that  any  required  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  have  been  completed \nprior to commencement of civil works, (ii) assessing implementation, (iii) progress reporting, and \n(iv)  assessing  the  impact  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  external \nmonitoring agency findings and quarterly reports will be filed independently with the EA, IA(s), \nand  ADB,  and  relevant  information  may  be  included  in  PMO  reporting.  A  nongovernment \norganization  may  be  engaged  as  required  to  support  the  PMO  with  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  activities.  The  LARF  will  ensure  that  women  receive  due \ncompensation for losses, and that women who are de facto household heads are clearly listed \nas  beneficiaries  for  compensation.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  agreed  to  pay \nresettlement compensation costs. \n \n100.  Tranche  1  has  been  categorized  as  category  B  for  resettlement.  The  NBD  component \nwill  require  some  land  acquisition  that  may  impact  up  to  five  families,  but  no  relocation  is \nrequired.  The  flood  management  component  requires  compensation  for  19  families  that  are \ncurrently farming in the area of the proposed protective embankment. Short land acquisition and \nresettlement plans (SLARPs) have been prepared for the affected persons. A summary of the \nLARF is found in Appendix 14 and the full LARF and SLARP are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n101. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  tranche  1  project  has  been  classified  as  category  C.  The \ntranche  1  project  areas  are  inhabited  by  different  ethnic  groups.  The  socioeconomic  features \nand  level  of  vulnerability  of  these  people  do  not  fit  with  the  characteristics  defined  by  ADB's \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The impact of subsequent tranche projects on indigenous \npeoples will be categorized through the initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) screening \nand  indigenous  peoples  categorization  followed  by  appropriate  actions  as  indicated  in  the \napproved  LARF.  Specific  actions  favorable  to  indigenous  peoples  will  be  included  in  the  land \nacquisition and resettlement plan or in the specific PFR document for projects categorized as B \nin terms of indigenous peoples impact. Projects undertaken as part of future tranches will avoid \nnegative  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  If  a  project  under  a  future  tranche  is  classified  as \ncategory  A  with  respect  to  indigenous  peoples  impacts,  an  indigenous  peoples  development \nplan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  Any  required \ndocuments relating to indigenous peoples will be attached to the PFR.  \n \n102.  Gender.  The  project's  gender  analysis  indicated  that  the  first  tranche  interventions  will \nnot create significant adverse or beneficial gender impacts that differ from the status quo. The \nanalysis also indicated that the Investment Program would have limited entry points for gender-\nrelated activities, because the role of women in water resources management and irrigation is \nnot  significant.  Other  concerns  that  do  affect  women\u2014such  as  the  creation  of  income \ngeneration activities (poultry, animal husbandry, carpet making, handicrafts, etc.)\u2014are not part \nof this project, and no impacts related to these issues are anticipated. However, in an effort to \naddress  gender-related  concerns  associated  with  the  Investment  Program,  the  project  will \nimprove access sites at irrigation canals where women traditionally gather to wash clothes and \ncollect water. Under the project, the gender specialist will work with the WUAs and community \ndevelopment  councils  to  solicit  views  from  women  on  the  design  and  location  of  the  access \npoints.  This  intervention  will  be  scaled  up  in  subsequent  tranches  that  also  have  irrigation-\n\n\fthe \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  existing  environmental \n\nrelated activities. The gender specialist for the NBD component will prepare options to introduce \nadditional gender interventions for tranches 2 and 3. \n \nD. \n \n103.  An EARF and cumulative impact assessment were prepared for the Investment Program \nfollowing \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Policy  (2002).  The  EARF  lays  out  the  procedures  and  provides  guidance  for \nInvestment  Program.  Environmental  capacity \nenvironmental  due  diligence  under \ndevelopment  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  supported  through  the  implementation \nconsultants\u2019 environmental specialist, who will be part of the safeguard team in the PMOs. The \nPMOs, with support from the consultants, will be responsible for environmental monitoring and \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  For  future  tranches,  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs),  or  environmental  impact  assessments,  if  required,  will  be \nprepared following the EARF and included in the appraisal report, with due public consultation \nand information disclosure. The finalized IEEs will be submitted with the PFR for ADB approval. \n \n104.  The IEE, including an EMP and summary IEE, was prepared for the first tranche, which \nis classified as category B in terms of environmental impacts. The Project should have positive \nimpacts on the environment including improved water-use efficiency, protection of assets from \nriver  bank  erosion  and  flooding,  and  better  land-use  management.  Potential  negative  impacts \ninclude  (i)  erosion  of  flood  protection  infrastructure;  (ii)  dust,  noise,  and  waste  during \nconstruction;  (iii)  flood  flow  displacement  due  to  headworks  operation;  and  (iv)  possible \ndegraded surface and groundwater quality and public health due to increased use of agricultural \ninputs. These will be mitigated by (i) development of a contractors\u2019 environmental management \nplan based on the EMP, with monitoring benchmarks; (ii) operation of infrastructure to minimize \nflood  damage;  (iii)  WUA  training  for  improved  water  management;  and  (iv)  RBA  capacity \nbuilding  related  specifically \ntechnically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  sound  operational  policies  and  procedures.  All  of  the  environmental  due \ndiligence documents for the first tranche and Investment Program are found in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \nE. \n \n105.  Security. Security has been declining in Afghanistan over the last 3 years and this could \ndelay or in some cases prevent successful implementation of interventions under the program. \nHowever,  experience  operating  in  Afghanistan  has  provided  lessons  to  mitigate  security  risks. \nProject  implementation  will  be  supported  by  adequate  security  resources,  including  for \ncommunications,  transport  and  physical  reinforcement  of  facilities.  Security  plans  will  be \ndeveloped for each activity with support from the Afghanistan Resident Mission security team; \nprivate and government security personnel will be engaged as required. \n \n106.  Capacity.  MEW  and  MAIL  both  require  technical,  project  management  and  financial \nmanagement capacity development. Previous experience has shown that counterpart capacity \nis generally inadequate to support project implementation, meaning adequate consultant input is \nrequired to ensure effective and timely project implementation. Formal and on-the-job capacity \ndevelopment  activities  will  take  place  in  parallel  with  project  implementation  and  counterpart \nstaff will assume more responsibility as capacity is developed. The long-term partnership under \nthe MFF modality helps support this approach. \n \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nto  developing  and \n\nimplementing \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nimproved \n107.  Operations  and  maintenance  sustainability.  The  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure  and  associated  project  benefits  will  depend  on  adequate  O&M  capacity  and \nfinancing.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  inadequate  O&M,  the  project  includes  (i)  O&M  training  and \nplanning  for  MEW  and  MAIL  staff;  (ii)  interim  project  O&M  funds,  with  the  assurance  that  the \nGovernment will allocate adequate recurrent budget resources for O&M; and (iii) WUA training \nin O&M and development of approaches to ensure their financial sustainability. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n108. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  the  following \nassurances, which have been largely incorporated into the FFA presented to the Board and will \nbe  incorporated,  as  appropriate,  into  the  legal  documents  for  projects  financed  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n109.  Policy  dialogue.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  about  its  policies  and \nprojects related to the water resources sector that are expected to materially affect the financial \nviability  of  each  project  under  the  Investment  Program,  and  in  particular  issues  that  will  affect \nthe implementation, management and O&M of existing assets and planned sector development.  \n \n110.  Nangahar  Valley  Development  Authority  restructuring. Prior to the commencement \nof civil works for the rehabilitation of the main canal of NVDA, MAIL will have endorsed a plan \nfor  the  corporatization  of  NVDA  that  includes  a  business  plan  for  operation  of  core  activities. \nThe  plan  will  also  define  a  structure  that  supports  an  irrigation  service  agency  for  the \nsustainable  O&M  of  the  main  canal,  and  secondary  and  tertiary  areas  of  command  still  under \nNVDA-managed irrigation, with requisite funding to support recurrent costs. \n \n111.  Project selection criteria and implementation arrangements. MEW will ensure that all \nprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  meet,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection \ncriteria  and  that  all  projects  are  properly  monitored  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB.  The  agreed \nselection criteria are presented in Appendix 6. \n \n112.  Program  and  project  directors  and  related  offices,  facilities  and  counterpart  staff. \nWithin  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  (i)  MEW  and  MAIL  will  appoint  program  and  project \ndirectors  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  MEW  will  establish  a  PMO  in  Kabul  and  MAIL  a  PMO  in \nJalalabad, together with all requisite counterpart staff; and (iii) MEW will establish the PDF with \nall requisite counterpart staff. MEW will also establish PIOs in Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan within \n3 months of grant effectiveness and with all requisite counterpart staff within 4 months of grant \neffectiveness.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart  staff  for  the  PMOs  and  PIOs  are \nsupplied  according  to  the  agreed  implementation  arrangements  and  serve  on  a  full-time  basis. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  staff  for  all  positions  on  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  are \ncompetitively  selected  and  remunerated,  free  and  clear  of  any  restrictions  applicable  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s public servants. \n \n113.  Counterpart staff. MEW and MAIL will ensure that counterpart staff will be provided as \nrequired  (within  reasonable  levels  identified  during  preparation  of  the  Project)  to  support \neffective and timely implementation of all activities under the Project.  \n \n114. \nInvestment program facilities. MEW and MAIL will ensure that office space with utilities \nand  other  resources  will  be  provided  as  required  (within  reasonable  levels  identified  during \npreparation of the Project) to support effective and timely implementation of all activities under \nthe Project. This includes office space for implementation consultants and support staff. \n \n\n\f115.  Operation  and  maintenance.  MEW  and  MAIL  commit  to  ensuring  the  O&M  of \ninfrastructure  built  under  the  Investment  Program.  To  ensure  RBAs  have  the  resources  to \nundertake O&M activities, the Government will commit to providing O&M budgets to RBAs for a \nspecified  timeframe.  In  the  longer  term,  the  Government  commits  to  developing  policies  and \nprocedures for the collection of fees for water service delivery as provided for under the Water \nLaw to support O&M of irrigation and water resources infrastructure. For structures maintained \nby  WUAs  (normally  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  structures),  the  Government  will  ensure \nadequate ongoing support to the WUAs to sustainably manage the O&M. \n \n116.  Auditing and accounting. MEW and MAIL will ensure that separate project accounts and \nrecords are maintained in a timely manner to adequately identify the use of tranche proceeds in a \nmanner  (and  in  accordance  with  details)  that  may  be  specified  in  each  financing  agreement  for \nrelevant  tranches.  Audited  financial  reports  of  MFF-financed  activities  will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nwithin 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n117.  Financial  governance.  MEW  and  MAIL  will  ensure  that their  respective internal controls \nare in accordance with the National Accounting Standards. \n \n118.  Environment.  MEW  and  MAIL  shall  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is  designed  and \nimplemented,  and  the  Project  facilities  constructed  and  operated,  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Recipient and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); (ii) the \ndesign and implementation of the Project strictly follows the mitigation measures set forth in the \nIEE for the Project, including the EMP and the EARF; (iii) mitigation measures identified in the \nEMP, if any, are incorporated in bidding documents and related contracts under the Project; (iv) \nbidding  documents  include  a  reference  to  the  EMP  to  ensure  that  environmental  issues  are \ncovered comprehensively; and (v) an environmental performance report is submitted to ADB on \na semiannual basis during the project implementation period in the format and containing such \ndetails  as  required  by  ADB.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  Recipient\u2019s  relevant  laws \nand regulations, and the requirements of ADB's Environment Policy, ADB's policy shall apply. \n \n119.  Land acquisition and resettlement. MEW and MAIL shall ensure that (i) the Project \nis designed and implemented in accordance with the Recipient's relevant laws and regulations, \nthe requirements of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the LARF as agreed \nwith  ADB;  (ii)  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  for  project  implementation  are  made \navailable in a timely manner; (iii) where land acquisition and resettlement are necessary, the \nrelated  works  will  commence  and  contractors  will  be  mobilized  only  after  the  related  land \nacquisition and resettlement  plan  (as  approved by  ADB) has been disclosed to the  affected \npeople  and  properly  carried  out;  and  (iv)  the  activities  of  all  relevant  contractors  are  in \ncompliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  related  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  If \nthere  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  Recipient's  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  ADB's  policy  shall  apply.  The \nRecipient shall engage an external agency or a nongovernment organization acceptable to ADB \nto  conduct  the  external  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  process  and  the  evaluation  of  relevant \nimpacts,  with  reports  from  the  independent  monitoring  agency  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a \nsemiannual basis. \n \n120. \nits \nimplementation do not negatively affect indigenous peoples in the territory of the  Recipient. In \nthe event that any such indigenous people are negatively affected or otherwise involved in any \nof the project activities, the Recipient shall take all necessary actions that are required by, or will \notherwise comply with, ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  MEW  and  MAIL  shall  ensure \n\nthe  Project  and \n\nthat \n\n \n\n29\n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n121.  Execution  of  civil  works  contracts.  MEW  and  MAIL  will  ensure  that,  subsequent  to \naward  of  civil  works  contract  under  any  project,  no  section  or  part  thereof  under  the  civil  works \ncontract  will  be  handed  over  to  the  contractor  unless  compliance  can  be  demonstrated  with  (i) \napplicable provisions of the land acquisition and resettlement framework and plans, including the \ntimely delivery of compensation to affected people; (ii) indigenous peoples development framework \nand  indigenous  peoples  development  plans;  and  (iii)  the  EARF  and  EMPs.  Any  changes  to  the \nlocation,  route,  alignment,  or  environment  impacts  resulting  from  changes  introduced  during \ndetailed design of related projects will be subject to prior approval by ADB and MEW or MAIL, in \naccordance with the project selection criteria and procedures specified in the FFA. MEW and MAIL \nwill  ensure  that  the  infrastructure  rehabilitated  or  newly  developed  under  the  Investment \nProgram will comply with technical specifications of the design. \n \n122.  Gender.  MEW  and  MAIL  will  follow  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998)  during  the  implementation  of  each  project,  including  taking  all  necessary \nactions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in planning and implementing \nproject  activities.  The  EA  and  IAs  will  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  effects  on  women  through,  where \nrelevant,  gender-disaggregated  data  collected  pursuant  to  the  M&E  system  referred  to  in  the \nPPMS. \n \n123.  Labor  and  health  standards. The Government shall ensure that all contractors under \nthe Investment Program: (i) comply with applicable labor laws of Afghanistan; and (ii) use their \nbest efforts to employ women and local people negatively affected by, or living in the vicinity of, \nthe  project  area.  Afghanistan  shall  also  ensure  that:  (i)  each  civil  works  contract  contains \nprovisions  prohibiting  (a)  the  use  of  child  labor  and  (b)  differentiation  in  wages  between  male \nand  female  workers  for  work  of  equal  value;  (ii)  such  contract  also  includes  mandatory \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions;  and  (iii)  the  relevant \ncontractors  and  their  workers  observe  local  protocols  concerning  acceptable  behavior  toward \nthe  local  population.  Afghanistan  shall further ensure  that each  implementing  agency,  with  the \nassistance  of  relevant  local  authorities,  causes  the  contractors  under  the  relevant  project, \nsubproject,  or  component  to  distribute  to  their  workers  information  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. \n \n124.

Agriculture employs about two \nthirds  of  the  population  and  comprises  up  to  half  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product, \nhowever,  the  contribution  varies  considerably  with  yearly  climatic  conditions.  Irrigation  is \nnecessary  in  most  areas  for  reliable  agriculture,  and  irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  about \n80%  of  all  agricultural  production.  About  85%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas \nand are either directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Development of \nthe  agricultural  sector,  which  requires  improved  access  to  irrigation,  is  essential  for  economic \ngrowth, enhanced livelihoods, and poverty reduction. \n \nHowever, irrigation and water resources infrastructure and the capacity and institutions \n2. \nto  manage  and  develop  it  have  been  severely  degraded  over  the  last  30  years.  By  the  mid-\n1970s, an area of almost 3 million hectares (ha) received some form of irrigation. Today, only \nabout 1.8 million ha receives irrigation due to the deterioration of irrigation systems from (i) civil \nunrest and war, (ii) floods and droughts, (iii) breakdown of institutions responsible for managing \nthe systems and their operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iv) a lack of resources for O&M \nand periodic rehabilitation. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Vision \n\n \n3. \nAfghanistan  National  Development  Strategy.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the \nGovernment)  is  addressing  this  situation  through  the  Afghanistan  National  Development \nStrategy  (ANDS  -  approved  in  April  2009),  which  provides  the  framework  and  specific  sector \nstrategies  for  the  development  of  Afghanistan. 50  The  ANDS  established  three  pillars  for \nsustained growth: (i) security, (ii) governance, rule of law and human rights, and (iii) economic \nsocial  development.  Development  of  water  resources  is  given  the  highest  priority  under  the \nANDS and its vision for the sector is \"to manage and develop the country's water resources so \nas  to  reduce  poverty,  increase  sustainable  economic  and  social  development,  improve  the \nquality of life for all Afghans and ensure and adequate supply of water for future generations.\" \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Water  Resources  Development  Investment \n4. \nProgram  (the  Investment  Program)  will  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  due  to \nimproved  water  resources  management  through  infrastructure  development,  capacity  building, \nand  institutional  strengthening.  The  Investment  Program's  outputs  will  include  (i)  physical \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  irrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure;  (ii)  the \ndevelopment  of  new  infrastructure  for  irrigation,  flood  management,  and  water  resources;  (iii) \nsupport  to  develop  and  implement  improved  institutional  frameworks  and  policies  for  irrigation, \nflood management, and water resources management; (iv) programs to strengthen line agencies, \nO&M, and management practices; and (v) capacity development programs to ensure sustainable \noutcomes. \n \n5. \nThe  approach  to  the  Investment  Program  is  to  develop  projects  that  integrate  physical \nand  nonphysical  elements  to  address  sector  needs  comprehensively  and  holistically,  and \n\n                                                 \n50 Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul (page 46). \n\n\fAppendix 3          43 \n\nachieve desired outcomes. This approach, combined with long-term ADB engagement through \nthe  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  modality,  will  provide  the  necessary  support  to \nsustainably  improve  the  performance  and  accelerate  development  of  water  resources  in \nAfghanistan. \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Challenges \n\n \n\na. \n\nPhysical Challenges \n\nDegraded \n\n \nWater  Resources  Availability.  On  an  average  per  capita  basis,  Afghanistan  receives \n6. \nadequate  precipitation,  so  that  it  should  not  be  a  water-scarce  country.  However,  surface  water \nrunoff  is  highly  seasonal  and  very  unevenly  distributed.  Over  half  of  Afghanistan's  water  runoff \n(much of it flood) flows into the Amu Darya River, which is expensive to develop, and it is far from \npopulation and economic growth centers. Harnessing water resources when and where they occur \nfor productive use is a key challenge to develop the sector.  \n \n7. \nInfrastructure.  Existing  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure  in \nAfghanistan  has  received  inadequate  O&M  over  the  last  30  years  and  is  extremely  degraded. \nSignificant investment in rehabilitation and upgrade is required to restore existing infrastructure to \nits full productive potential. \n \nLack of New Infrastructure. While Afghanistan has water resources that it can harness for \n8. \nproductive purposes, it has not invested in new water resources and irrigation infrastructure over \nthe last several decades. Substantial investment is needed to help Afghanistan bridge the gap from \nyears of stagnated economic development. \n \n9. \nFloods and Bank Erosion. One impact of the unevenly distributed perception and runoff is \npervasive annual flooding and bank erosion, which cause damage to irrigation systems and leads \nto  the  permanent  loss  of  agricultural  land,  livestock,  and  rural  infrastructure.  In  years  of  high \nflows,  the  impacts  are  particularly  acute  with  substantial  damage  and  losses.  The  Ministry  of \nEnergy  and  Water  (MEW),  which  has  primary  responsibility  for  water  resources,  is  currently \nworking to develop a flood management policy, yet need assistance and capacity development \nto  complete  this  as  well  as  to  put  together  a  long-term  plan  and  investment  program  for  flood \nmanagement throughout all Afghanistan. \n \n10. \nTransboundary Considerations. Over 95% of Afghanistan's water resources are in rivers \nthat flow into neighboring countries. This makes development of water resources more challenging \nsince coordination and agreements with riparian neighbors may be needed for their development. \n \n11. \nInefficient  Water  Resources  Management.  Since  most  of  the  irrigation  in  Afghanistan \n(about 80%) is from traditional systems that are not engineered and constructed from rudimentary \nmaterials, irrigation efficiency is low. The problem is exacerbated by their degradation over the last \ndecades. The lack of investment in new infrastructure has also hampered water use efficiency. Not \nonly  are  there  technical  constraints,  but  irrigation  and  water  management  practices  need  to  be \nimproved  at  the  system  as  well  as  the  on-farm  level.  The  sector  would  benefit  significantly  from \ntraining  and  the  introduction  of  more  efficient  irrigation  technologies  and  management  practices. \nTremendous  scope  exists  to  increase  water  use  efficiency  at  all  levels  to  ensure  the  most \nproductive use of all water resources. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f44          Appendix 3 \n \n\nb. \n\nNonphysical Challenges \n\n \n12. \nLack  of  Water  Resources  Knowledge  Base.  Effective  water  management, \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading,  and  development  of  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure \nrequire quality data. A severe lack of surface and groundwater data, meteorological data, and \nagricultural  data  among  others  exists  constraining  effective  planning  and  management. \nMonitoring  capability  is  limited  both  from  a  lack  of  technical  resources  and  human  capacity  to \nmanage  data  collection  and  analysis.  A  concerted  effort  is  needed  to  ensure  that  that \nmeasurement and monitoring systems and the institutions and capacity to use them effectively \nare put in place to support sector development. \n \n13. \nCapacity  and  Weak  Institutions.  Capacity  is  still  weak  across  many  aspects  of  project \npreparation and management for water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan. The MEW has a \nsolid policy framework under the new Water Law and various sector strategies, however, it requires \nsubstantial  assistance  to  carry  out  its  mandate  and  execute  the  sector  strategies.  After  having \nsupported implementation of previous donor projects as well as receiving technical assistance \nfor  capacity  development,  MEW's  staff  capacity  to  develop  and  manage  water  resources  is \nimproving  with  regard  to  basic  engineering  and  project  management  although  external \nassistance  is  still  needed.  However,  strengthening  MEW  and  its  staff  to  carry  out  the  new \nchallenges of creating and effectively managing River Basin Agencies (RBAs) as called for under \nthe new National Water Law will require a new approach and skills that do not exist in MEW. \n \n14. \nFeasibility  Studies  and  Investment  Plan.  Substantial  work  is  being  undertaken  for \nrehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation systems throughout Afghanistan, but little investment is \ntaking  place  to  develop  new  infrastructure.  Although  potential  projects  exist,  part  of  the \ninvestment constraint is a lack of quality feasibility studies. MEW has contracted preparation of \nfeasibility  studies  to  regional  firms,  however,  many  of  the  completed  studies  need  additional \nwork on technical options, economics, safeguards, and other issues to bring them to a standard \nthat would support ADB investments. \n \n15.  MEW has a list of priority investments, yet it is not fully supported by objective selection \ncriteria  or  complete  data  and  project  information.  However,  even  with  good  feasibility  studies, \nanalysis  is  required  to  prioritize  and  sequence  projects,  especially  in  a  river  basin  context, \nwhere upstream developments can impact downstream projects. Additional work is required and \nis  ongoing  to  (i)  develop  better  feasibility  studies  to  support  investment,  and  (ii)  prioritize  and \nsequence investments as the basis of a comprehensive sector investment plan. \n \nOperation  and  Maintenance  (O&M)  of  Infrastructure.  The  Government  has  limited \n16. \nfunds  and  capacity  for  O&M  of  large  water  resources  infrastructure.  Donor  funds  and \nGovernment  general  revenues  can  be  used  in  the  short  term  for  recurrent  costs  however,  a \nlonger  term  solution  is  required.  Under  the  new  Water  Law,  fees  can  be  collected  for  water \ndelivery costs, and the Government is committed to developing tariff strategies for O&M funds to \nreduce subsidies and achieve O&M sustainability. Developing and implementing these policies \nwill  become  more  critical  as  new  infrastructure  is  developed  in  the  coming  years.  Since  over \n80% of irrigated area is from traditional systems, communities have been responsible for O&M \nfor  hundreds  of  years.  Yet,  the  strength  of  the  traditional  management  has  declined  in  recent \nyears. Support is required to build upon the traditional community management structures and \nto  establish water  user associations  (WUAs)  under  the  Water  Law.  While  O&M  still  remains  a \nchallenge, opportunities and strategies are in place to address it on multiple levels. \n \n17. \nPoppy  Cultivation. Afghanistan currently produces over 90% of the world's opium and \npoppy  production  and  poses  a  huge  social,  political,  and  security  challenge.  Opportunities  for \n\n\fAppendix 3          45 \n\nalternative  livelihoods  are  required  in  rural  areas  to  ease  the  reliance  on  the  opium  economy. \nImproved  access  to  irrigation,  especially  for  higher  value  second  season  cropping,  provides \nenhanced incomes that blunt the strong economic incentives to grow poppy. At the same time, \nassurances  are  required  from  communities  receiving  assistance  that  they  will  abstain  from \npoppy production. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Map \n\n \n18. \nThe road map is based on the ANDS strategy, which includes desired sector outcomes \nand physical and nonphysical targets, as well as ADB sector analysis to guide the Investment \nProgram.  Table  A3.1  highlights  the  critical  milestones  for  sector  development  along  with \ntimelines.  The  ANDS  strategy  and  the  road  map  below  includes  long-term  milestones  and \nalthough many of the activities may be planned to take place well into the future, this is likely the \nmost realistic scenario for Afghanistan. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Road Map with Milestones for Water Resources and Irrigation \n \n\nObjective \n\nMilestone \n\nTimeline \n\nResponsibility \u2013

As  noted,  the  ANDS  provides  the \n19. \noverall development framework and specific sector strategies for irrigation and water resources \nin  Afghanistan.  To  flesh  out  the  sector  strategy,  road  map  and  investment  plan  the  ANDS  is \nsupported  by  a  national  Water  Sector  Strategy  that  addresses  all  subsectors  including  water \nsupply,  environment,  and  hydropower  among  others. 51  The  ANDS  and  supporting  strategy \nhighlights the importance to water resources with regard to economic development, and notes \nthat  both  the  Government  and  donors  have  under-invested  in  better  water  resources \nmanagement with negative consequences for the productive lives of the people.  \n \n20. \nThe  ANDS  and  supporting  sector  strategy  include  a  set  of  investment  programs  for \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  institutional  and  capacity  strengthening  to  develop  the  sector.  In \naddition  to  the  investments,  the  ANDS  has  a  Water  Sector  Strategic  Action  Plan  that  outlines \npolicy,  institutional,  and  capacity  development  activities  needed  to  achieve  desired  sector \noutcomes, which are reflected in the road map above. The ANDS programmatic approach plus \nthe existing legal and policy framework including the new Water Law (see para. 22), provide the \nstrategic framework to support sector investment. The ANDS programs and their objectives and \ninitial  investment  program  provide  a  well-defined  road  map  to  guide  sector  investment. \nRefinements are required and are ongoing, and the ADB Investment  Program  will be updated \nas better information becomes available and new projects are prepared. \n \nADB  Strategy.  ADB's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Afghanistan (2009\u2013\n21. \n2013) is fully aligned with the ANDS. The CPS highlights four sectors for ADB investments: (i) \nenergy,  (ii)  transportation  and  communication,  (iii)  agriculture  and  natural  resources  (including \nirrigation  and  water  resources),  and  (iv)  governance.  The  new  strategy  for  the  water  sector \nrepresents  a  continuation  of  the  previous  objectives  from  the  CPS  Update  (2005\u20132008). \n\n                                                 \n51 The ANDS strategy is based on the first national water strategy that was drafted and adopted in 2004. The Water \nLaw  specifically  tasks  MEW  with  formulation  and  implementation  of  a  national  water  strategy.  It  also  requires  the \nRBAs to develop basin strategies and development plans, which can form the basis of a consolidated national plan. \nStrategic planning for water sector development has already received substantial attention and the process is now \ninstitutionalized  under  the  Water  Law.  The  main  issue  is  to  develop  capacity  and  secure  resources  to  implement \nand improve the strategic work.  \n\n\fAppendix 3          49 \n\nPolicy and Institutional Framework \n\nHowever,  investments  and  institutions  are  supported  in  a  more  programmatic  fashion  through \nthe  combination  of  physical  and  nonphysical  investments  under  the  MFF  modality.  The  new \nstrategy attaches special importance to themes, particularly gender and development, capacity, \nand private sector development. In addition to the CPS, the Investment Program is fully aligned \nwith  Strategy  2020\u2013the  Long  Term  Strategic  Framework,  which  includes  investment  in  water \nresources  infrastructure  as  a  core  ADB  business  activity.  The  Government's  commitment  to  a \npolicy  framework  based  on  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  principles \ncontained in the Water Law and ANDS are consistent with the ADB Water Policy, Water for All. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nNational  Water  Law.  The  policy  framework  for  water  resources  is  well  structured  to \naddress  the  challenges  of  the  water  sector  in  Afghanistan,  however,  developing  the  capacity \nand strengthening the institutions to implement the framework will require significant resources \nand a long-term commitment. The corner stone of the policy framework is the new Water Law \n(signed  by  the  President  on  30  April  2009)  that  is  based  on  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement  principles.  The  Water  Law  establishes  the  overarching  sector  framework  and \nministerial responsibilities, not only for irrigation and water resources management, but all other \nsubsectors  including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  hydropower,  and  the  environment,  among \nothers. \n \n23.  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water.  MEW  is  the  lead  agency  for  water  resources  whose \nresponsibility  includes  (i)  making  policies  to  guide  and  strategies  planning,  development  and \nprotection of water resources; and (ii) regulating use of water resources. Under the new Water \nLaw, RBAs have been established under MEW to replace the previous provincial field structure. \nRBCs  made  up  of  line  agencies,  local  government,  and  water  users  have  been  established \nunder the Water Law to provide policy guidance and oversee permitting and disputes resolution \nfor  their  associated  RBA.  The  Water  Law  supports  water  end-user  participation  in  decision \nmaking for (i) water resources planning, implementation, and management; (ii) operations and \nmaintenance; and (iii) determination of water allocations. Although five RBAs have been created \nacross  the  country,  they  are  not  yet  functional,  and  lacking  staff  and  resources  adequate  to \ncarry out their mandate. The work to establish the RBCs is also in its nascent stages. Under the \nfive  main  RBAs  and  RBCs  that  cover  the  country,  sub-basin  agencies  and  councils  are  to  be \nestablished as required for more localized management. \n \n24.  Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock. MEW is the lead ministry for water \nresources  and  irrigation,  however,  MAIL  has  responsibility  for  on-farm  water  management \n(OFWM)  as  well  as  development  of  smaller  irrigation  concerns,  although  in  practice  MAIL  is \ncurrently not implementing any irrigation projects.52 MAIL has very limited capacity for irrigation \nbut  has  its  own  irrigation  sector  strategy  with  the  emphasis  on  small  water  harvesting  and \nOFWM interventions, the latter of which is vital to help achieve the maximum productivity from \nirrigation  system  rehabilitation  and  upgrading.  Donors  are  working  with  MAIL  to  develop  this \ncapacity, and MAIL will play an increasingly important and effective role for irrigated agriculture. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nTo  achieve  sector  objectives,  the  ANDS  structured  10  programs  with  associated \ninvestments for the water sector, 5 of which address irrigation and water resources. The initial \ninvestment  plans  for  each  of  the  programs  were  developed  for  the  medium  term,  however, \n\nInvestment Program \n\n                                                 \n52 NVDA is an exception to MAIL's normal operations.   \n\n \n\n\f50          Appendix 3 \n \n\nthese  will  evolve  as  more  projects  and  sector  needs  are  identified.  The  ANDS  programs  and \ntheir objectives are well structured to achieve sector goals, and these should remain in place to \nsupport sector development. The Program Development Facility to be established under the first \ntranche  of  the  Investment  Program  will  work  with  MEW,  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders to refine and update the Government's sector investment plan and ANDS programs. \nThe relevant ANDS programs for water resources and irrigation are listed below. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe \nInstitutional  Set-up  and  Capacity  Building  Program  supports  capacity \ndevelopment for water resources management institutions at all levels from WUAs to \nRBAs, and MEW at the national level. In addition to technical competence, financial \ncapacity for infrastructure and recurrent costs as well as the development of financial \nmanagement capacity are also stressed. This program will support the development \nand implementation of sector laws, policies, and rules and regulations. \nThe  National  Water  Resources  Development  Program  is  the  largest  program \nfinancially and focuses on development of new infrastructure. It addresses both the \nneed for improved planning and project development capacity as well as resources \nfor  new  infrastructure  development.  The  estimated  cost  of  this  program  is  over  $2 \nbillion dollars, which in medium term is likely unrealistic, however, in the longer term \nis far short of what will be required to develop infrastructure for the sector.  \nThe  National  River  Basin  Management  Program  targets  implementation  of  the  new \ninstitutional  structure  for  water  management  under  the  Water  Law  and  capacity  to \nmanage water based on IWRM principles. Development of capacity for stakeholder \nparticipation for water management is stressed. \nThe  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Program  supports  rehabilitation  of  mainly  traditional \nsystems,  which  are  the  majority  in  Afghanistan.  This  includes  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading of existing infrastructure along with improved O&M and management. \nThe  Riverbank  Protection  Program  addresses  bank  erosion  and  flood  control.  It \nlooks at shorter- (including emergency) and longer-term structural and nonstructural \nmanagement options and development of a national program. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nE. \n \nThe  ADB  Investment  Program  and  first  tranche  investments  are  fully  aligned  with  and \n26. \nsupport the objectives and national programs outlined under the ANDS investment plan (para. \n25). The ANDS proposed a comprehensive water sector investment program for $3,761 million for \nthe entire water sector. MEW has revised this to $2,468 million over the medium term based on the \nANDS national programs for irrigation and water resources management. Table A3.2 provides the \ncurrent medium term investment plan based on the ANDS programs. \n \n\nTable A3.2: Medium-Term Water Sector Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nInstitutional Set-up and Capacity Building Program \nWater  Resource \n\nInfrastructure  Management \n(includes  National  River  Basin \n\nProgram \nManagement and Irrigation Rehabilitation) \nBank Protection and Flood Control Program \nNational Water Resources Development Program \n\nTotal \n\nMedium Term \n\n46.0 \n\n133.0 \n161.0 \n2,128.0 \n2,468.0 \n\nSource: Ministry of Energy and Water and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\fAppendix 3          51 \n\n \n27. \nCurrently, the resources available to support this investment plan are just over $800 million \nor  a  third  of  the  needs  identified  by  MEW.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  sector  investment  plan  and \nfinancing  will increase as additional  projects  and needs are  identified  with better information  and \nimproved capacity for planning. As noted, the MEW investment plan has optimistic targets, yet will \nbe updated. While the investment plan may be refined, the objectives of the ANDS Water Sector \nStrategy and the ANDS programmatic approach develop the sector along with the legal and policy \nframework including the new water law and provide a sound strategic framework to support the \nsector  investment.

Selected \nprojects  agreed  to  by  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  utilizing  the  approval  process  detailed  below  will  be  prepared  to  a \nstandard acceptable to ADB by the Program Development Facility (PDF) under the Ministry of \nEnergy  and  Water  (MEW)  during  the  first  5  years  of  the  Investment  Program.  The  selection \ncriteria include: (i) general criteria for all interventions pursued under the Investment Program, \n(ii) specific criteria for interventions involving flood management and river bank erosion, and (iii) \nspecific criteria for interventions involving irrigation (Table A6).  \n \nB. \n \nThe  appraisal  process  has  already  been  undertaken  for  the  first  tranche  periodic \n2. \nfinancing  request  (PFR)  under  the  Investment  Program.  Investments  for  interventions  to  be \nproposed for inclusion in subsequent PFRs will be processed in accordance with the following \nprocedures. \n \n3. \nThe  PDF,  acting  on  behalf  of  MEW,  will  undertake  a  preliminary  assessment\u2014including \npreliminary site visits as required\u2014of the proposed interventions to ensure compliance with the \nInvestment  Program's  selection  criteria.  During  this  preliminary  assessment,  the  PDF  will \nprepare  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  and  complete  the  requisite  ADB  safeguard \nchecklists  to  determine  the  initial  project  categorization  with  respect  to  the  environment, \nindigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. \n \nBased  on  the  preliminary  assessment,  the  PDF  will  recommend  those  investment \n4. \npackages  deemed  suitable  for  a  full  feasibility  study.  The  PDF's  recommendations  will  be \nreviewed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MEW, and ADB, and their concurrence to proceed \nwill be obtained before the PDF contracts the feasibility study and/or detailed design to prepare \nthe investment. If a proposed intervention is not likely to satisfy the selection criteria and/or the \nagreed approval procedures, ADB will inform MOF and MEW, who will advise the PDF to either \n(i) modify the intervention proposal in such a way that it will be eligible, or (ii) reject the proposed \nintervention.  In  the  latter  case,  the  PDF  may  propose  a  replacement  subproject  that  will  be \nsubjected  to  same  selection  process.  Feasibility-level  assessment  and/or  detailed  design  of \napproved  investment  packages  will  be  contracted  to  a  consulting  firm  or  individual(s)  by  the \nPDF, with the results reported to the program steering committee (PSC). \n \nBased  on  the  feasibility  studies  and/or  detailed  design  for  the  interventions  that  are \n5. \ntechnically  feasible,  economically  viable,  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable,  and  in \ncompliance with the selection criteria, the PDF will prepare draft appraisal reports and requisite \nADB  safeguard  due  diligence  documents  along  with  recommendations  that  the  proposal  be  \nincluded in the next PFR prepared for ADB consideration. Projects that are recommended will \nbe subject to the approval of the PSC. Upon obtaining the PSC\u2019s concurrence with the PDF\u2019s \nrecommendations concerning subprojects to be included under the Investment Program, MOF \nwill submit the PFR to ADB for approval. MOF will ensure that the necessary internal approvals \nhave been obtained prior to submission of the PFR. ADB will then review the PFR for approval \nin accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6         59 \n\nTable A6: Investment Program Selection Criteria \n \n\nGeneral Selection Criteria \nThe intervention should be consistent with accepted integrated water resources management planning principles and \nthe Investment Program's road map that supports the Government's water resources sector investment plan. \nThe economic return on the investment packages considered should be at least 12%.  \nThe intervention should not have a negative impact\u2014in terms of water quality or quantity\u2014on other water users who \nhave a recognized entitlement and are reliant on water supplied by the same water system (basin). \nEach  subsequent  investment  under  the  proposed  MFF  must  address  all  ADB  safeguards,  including  environment, \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples as detailed in the Financing Framework Agreement. MEW and PDF staff must \nensure  that  this  criterion  can  be  met  or  that  cost-effective  mitigation  measures  will  satisfy  requirements  during  the \npreliminary assessment of potential projects approved for further feasibility study. \nThe intervention should not present unacceptable technical risks in terms of its development or operation that would \nundermine its efficacy, economic return, or safety. \nPotential investments must have provisions and assurances and/or commitments for adequate O&M of the completed \nworks.  This  could  be  in  the  form  of  temporary,  declining  levels  of  funding  from  ADB  or  other  development  funds \ncomplemented by increasing levels of government support, water-user funding, and/or in kind contributions adequate \nto meet all recurrent expenditures and/or O&M. \nThe intervention should be of a size and scale such that the beneficiaries are capable of independently operating and \nmaintaining the systems when construction activities are complete, unless there is a government entity charged with \nmanagement  and  O&M  of  a  project  or  subproject  that  cannot  be  managed  by  the  community.  The  intended \nbeneficiaries  must  have  indicated  enthusiasm  for  the  intervention  and  a  willingness  to  operate  and  manage  it  in  a \ncohesive  fashion  as  demonstrated  through  willingness  to  contribute  cash  or  in-kind  labor  to  the  subproject \ndevelopment and through willingness to develop and commit to execution of a management and O&M plan. \nThe community(s) must have an adequate decision making structure for identifying needs, accessing resources, and \ndistributing benefits in an equitable manner to all members of the community. \nThe intervention will have a positive impact on a significant portion of the local community. \nTransboundary water issues must be adequately addressed as part of the project selection and preparation process. \nInterventions  must  have  water  resources  requirements  that  would  be  in  compliance  with  existing  international \nagreements, or it must be possible to achieve a new agreement or concurrence among the concerned riparians. \nSelection Criteria for Flood Management and River Bank Erosion \nInterventions should be selected based on their ability to mitigate flood or erosion risk while providing a satisfactory \neconomic rate of return without creating negative impacts. \nInterventions that could have the potential to result in morphological changes in the river regime and generate major \nunforeseen negative impacts should be avoided, provided alternative protection measures can be identified. \nInterventions  that  could  inadvertently  result  in  adverse  impacts  on  water  users  currently  taking  water  from  the  river \nshould be avoided. \nFlood management or bank protection works are not to be considered without the inclusion of mitigating measures as \npart of the intervention if they would result in (i) the reduction of a river or wash cross section, or (ii) increased water \nsurface elevations to pass a flood of given magnitude, or (iii) pose any risk of main channel deposition or blockage. \nInterventions  that  have  the  potential  to  negate  people's  rights  to  riverbank  access  are  not  to  be  included  unless \nalternative access routes are identified and confirmed with the affected communities \nSelection Criteria Specifically for Irrigation  \nCommunities receiving assistance must pledge to abstain from poppy cultivation. \nThe  soils  and  topography  must  be  suitable  for  constructing  irrigation  works  and  supporting  irrigated  agriculture, \nincluding  adequate  natural  drainage,  and  not  subject  to  the  risk  of  excessive  settlement,  poor  stability,  or  severe \nerosion. \nThe sustainable financial returns to all farmers from the intervention must be adequate to offset any associated cost \nincreases. \nPriority will be accorded to those investments having significant positive impact on the food production base to help \nensure food security for Afghanistan. \nADB =

The funds will be disbursed in \nthree  tranches,  and  the  Investment  Program  will  implement  a  program  of  activities  to  develop \nthe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing \nwater  resources \ninfrastructure,  development  of  new  infrastructure,  and  capacity  and  institutional  strengthening \nfor improved management of water resources. \n \nThe  first  tranche  has  three  investment  components.  The  first  component,  northern \n2. \nbasins  development  (NBD),  will  take  place  in  the  Lower  Balkh  River  Basin  and  supports  (i) \nconstruction  of  the  Bangala  weir,  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  Samarkandian  and \nNahre Shahi weirs, (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of approximately 250 irrigation structures on \nmain canals, (iv) pilot improvements to secondary and tertiary structures, (v) improved access \npoints for women to collect canal water, (vi) formation of water users associations (WUAs) with \ntraining  and  demonstrations,  and  (vii)  strengthening  the  Northern  Basins  River  Basin  Agency \nand  Council.  The  second  component,  Nangahar  Valley  Development  Authority  (NVDA) \nimprovement,  will  support  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  main,  secondary,  and  tertiary \ncanals of the NVDA irrigation system, totalling about 20,000 hectares (ha); (ii) establishment of \nWUAs  and  on-farm  water  management,  and  improved  agricultural  practices  training  and \ndemonstrations;  and  (iii)  development  of  a  corporate  business  plan  to  reform  NVDA \nmanagement.  Component  3,  flood  management,  will  construct  (i)  a  6  kilometer  flood \nembankment with trial forest plantation and bank protection works along the Amu Darya River at \nYangi Qala, (ii) new headworks to control the flow of water into the Yatim Tapa irrigation canal, \nand (iii) river bank protection works to mitigate erosion. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nProject  interventions  will  provide  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation  systems  with \nimproved distribution structures, and in particular permanent headworks for river off-takes in the \nNBD. Since traditional systems require significant levels of annual maintenance, one benefit of \nthe  project  will  be  the  reduction  of  annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  will  be  supported  by  on-farm  demonstrations  for \nfarmers  regarding  methods  for  optimizing  water  management  for  improved  performance  and \nproduction.  The  flood  management  activities  will  protect  rural  assets.  The  principal  benefits  of \nthe Project will accrue from improvements in agricultural production, and avoided losses through \nthe  protection  of  land,  buildings,  and  other  infrastructure  from  floods  and  bank  erosion.  The \nbenefits  of  the  interventions  have  been  estimated  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-\nproject scenarios. \n \n4. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  using  first  quarter  2009  constant \nprices  and  the  exchange  rate  used  was  $1  =  AF50.  The  following  key  parameters  and \nassumptions were used in the analysis: \n \n\nApproach and Main Assumptions \n\nuse of the world price numeraire; \n\nagricultural  input  and  output  prices  are  based  on  current  prices  reported  by \nfarmers  during  surveys  carried  out  for  project  preparation,  supplemented  by \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f78          Appendix 12 \n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\navailable market data from the project areas and available data from secondary \nsources; \n\na standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.981 has been used for most agricultural \ninputs and outputs, except that specific conversion factors have been estimated \nfor  wheat  (0.83),  rice  (0.71),  maize  (0.77),  urea  (0.92),  and  diammonium \nphosphate  (0.66)  based  on  June  2009  international  prices  with  appropriate \nadjustments  for  transport,  handling,  marketing  and  processing. 2 For  unskilled \nlabor, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 was used to take account of surplus labor \nin rural areas; and \n\nthe  project  implementation  period  for  the  first  tranche  of  the  Project  will  be  5 \nyears and the economic life is 25 years. \n\nProject Costs and Benefits \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nProject costs were estimated using prices prevailing in the first half of 2009 and include \ninvestment  costs  for  new  construction,  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure, \nsupport  for  improved  water  management  through  the  establishment  of  WUAs  and  other \nmeasures, project management, and O&M. The total cost of project interventions under the first \ntranche is $92.9 million (including contingencies). The first tranche of the project also includes \nfunding  of  $9.3  million  for  a  program  development  facility  (PDF)  that  will  identify  potential \ninvestments  and  carry  out  feasibility  assessments  for  subsequent  tranches  of  the  Investment \nProgram.  Also  included  is  funding  of  $3.3  million  for  the  Helmand  Basin  Master  Plan,  to  be \ncofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom. \n \n6. \nBenefits: Northern basins development. The quantified benefits of the Project\u2019s NBD \ncomponent derive from the two main interventions: (i) the construction of the Bangala weir; and \n(ii)  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  about  250  main  canal  structures  in  the  lower  Balkh \nirrigation system, which builds on work begun under the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation \nand  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP).3 The  Project  will  undertake  measures  to  improve  water \nmanagement,  both  on-farm  and  in  the  canal  systems,  including  through  the  development  of \nWUA on-farm water management demonstrations. \n \n7. \nAnnual  crop  production  in  the  Balkh  river  basin  depends  on  winter  snowfalls  in  the \nmountains, spring rains, and the resulting river flows. In a normal year, the lower Balkh system \nintensively irrigates about 84,000 ha, although system improvements under EIRRP are reported \nto  have  increased  the  area  irrigated  in  a  normal  year  by  10%.  The  actual  area  receiving \nadequate irrigation varies according to the annual precipitation in a given year. \n \n8. \nConstruction  of  the  Bangala  weir  will  provide  better  control  of  diverted  flows  to  the \ncommand areas of the Aqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals (totalling 39,200 ha), which will \nreduce  operational  losses  in  the  head  reaches  and  throughout  the  command  areas.  Overall \noperational  irrigation  efficiency  is  expected  to  increase  from  45%  to  55%.  The  benefits  of  this \nproject  arise  from  increases  in  cropped  area  and  crop  yields  that  come  about  as  a  result  of  a \nmore assured water supply. The level of benefits will depend upon the farm location within the \ncanal system. The greatest impact will be in the tail reaches of canals, because improved water \n\n                                                 \n1  The SCF was estimated based on import and export data from the years 2007 to 2009. \n2  Details of the estimates are given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n3  ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          79           \n\ncontrol and efficiency will make proportionally more water available for the tail areas than for the \nhead  and  middle  reaches  of  canals,  which  are  already  relatively  well  supplied.  In  general,  no \nsignificant  changes  in  cropping  patterns  have  been  assumed.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of \nthe main canal structures will have similar, smaller impacts spread throughout the entire 84,000 \nha command area of the irrigation system.  \n \n9. \nThe head, middle and tail reaches of each command area are assumed to be equal in \narea  and  for  the  northern  basins  have  present  cropping  intensities  of  156%  (head),  135% \n(middle),  and  66%  (tail).  The  wheat  crop  provides  about  one  third  of  project  benefits  and  at \npresent  has  yields  of  between  2.7  tons/ha  in  the  head  reaches  and  1.4  tons/ha  in  the  tail \nreaches. Other important crops are winter vegetables such as cauliflower, with yields of 15.0\u2013\n17.5  tons/ha  and  summer  melons  with  yields  up  to  25  tons/ha  in  the  head  reaches,  but \nachieving as little as 6\u20137 tons in the tail reaches where the water supply is currently unreliable. \n \n10. \nare given in Table A12.1. \n \n\nThe production assumptions used in the analysis and the changes in cropping intensities \n\nTable A12.1: Northern Basins - With Project Increases in Agricultural Productivity \n(%) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nArea \nCultivated \n\nBangala Weir \n\nCrop Yield \n\nCropping \nIntensity \n\nR&U of Main Canal Structures \nArea \nCultivated \n\nCropping \nIntensity \n\nCrop Yield \n\nHead reaches \nMiddle reaches \nTail reaches \nR&U = rehabilitation and upgrade. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n5.0 \n9.0 \n12.5 \n\n3 \n5 \n7 \n\n6.5 \n12.1 \n8.3 \n\n2 \n3 \n5 \n\n1 \n1 \n2 \n\n2.0 \n4.0 \n3.1 \n\n \n11.  With  the  Project,  benefits  accrue  from  an  estimated  additional  3,450  ha  due  to \nconstruction of the Bangala weir and 2,772 ha due to rehabilitation and upgrading of the main \ncanal  structures.  The  total  increase  in  grain  production  is  expected  to  be  about  9,640  tons, \nincluding  wheat  and  maize,  but  principally  wheat  from  the  increased  cultivated  area  made \npossible  by  the  Bangala  weir.  There  will  be  significant  increases  in  the  production  of  second-\nseason  fruit  and  vegetables.  Due  to  increased  on-farm  production  activity,  the  increase  in \ndemand for labor is expected to be about 400,000 person days/year, or some 5.2 days/ha/year \ndue  to  the  Bangala  weir  and  2.4  days/ha/year  due  to  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the \nmain canal structures. \n \n12. \nNo  benefits  have  been  quantified  for  other  activities  under  the  NBD  component, \nincluding the (i) rehabilitation of the Nahre Shahi and Samarkandian weirs, (ii) the upgrading of \nstructures  on  selected  secondary  and  tertiary  canals,  and  (iii)  development  of  improved \nwomen's access points to collect canal water. Benefits, potentially substantial, will also accrue \nfrom strengthening of the Northern Basins RBA that will operate the physically improved weirs \nfor more effective water management throughout the Lower Balkh Basin. The Project will also \nlead to greater production of fodder crops and straw. Both will benefit livestock production, but \nthese benefits have not been quantified. The economic returns for the component are therefore \nlower than they would be if it were possible to quantify all benefits. \n \nBenefits: NVDA improvement. Current production in the NVDA area is constrained by \n13. \ndegradation  of  the  irrigation  system.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  main  canal  and \nassociated secondary and tertiary canals will restore the system to full capacity. The command \n\n \n\n\f80          Appendix 12 \n \n\narea of the NVDA system includes four state farms covering a total of about 10,000 ha, of which \nnot more than about 7,600 ha is estimated to be cultivable, and 14,000 ha of private farms, of \nwhich  about  11,900  ha  is  cultivated.  The  current  cropping  intensity  on  the  state  farm  land  is \nestimated to be 56%, but on private farms is generally between 162% and 173%, and may be \nhigher in some cases. The Project will increase water availability and reliability at the farm level. \nThe  benefits  accrue  from  increases  in  the  area  cultivated  and  increased  project  yields.  In \naddition,  a  modest  increase  of  tree  crops  on  private  farms  (about  1.5%  of  total  area),  is \nassumed  at  the  expense  of  grain  production.  Tree  crops  are  well  established  in  the  area  and \nfarmers are likely to take advantage of better water supplies to increase investment in this more \nprofitable crop. \n \n14. \nPresent yields are generally higher in the NVDA area than in the Balkh River Basin. In \nthe NVDA area, wheat\u2014with yields between 1.85 tons/ha in the tail reaches and 3.5 tons/ha in \nthe  head  reaches\u2014provides  about  a  quarter  of  the  benefits.  Because  of  the  proximity  of  both \nlocal and Pakistani markets, a wide range of winter and summer vegetables are grown, as well \nas both citrus and stone fruit. With-project changes are summarized in Table A12.2. Because of \nthe relatively low current yields on the state farm areas, a higher average increase is anticipated \nfor these areas, because improved water and on-farm management will be starting from a low \nbase. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Nangahar Valley Development Authority \u2014 With-Project Increases in \nAgricultural Productivity \n(%) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nPrivate Farms \n\nCrop Yield \n\nArea \nCultivated \n\nArea \nCultivated \n\nState Farms \n\nCrop Yield \n\nCropping \nIntensity \n\n10a \n\n10 \n\n25.6b \n\n4 \n8 \n10 \n\nHead reaches \nMiddle reaches \nTail reaches \na For existing crops. \nb Includes addition of new crops to cropping pattern. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n2.0 \n3.5 \n5.0 \n\nCropping \nIntensity \n6.3 \n7.7 \n16.2 \n\n15.  With the Project, an estimated additional 870 ha will be cropped in the private farm areas \nand  760  ha  on  the  state  farms.  Benefits  will  include  an  increase  in  grain  production  of  4,398 \ntons, including wheat (2,723 tons), rice (1,111 tons) and maize (564 tons). Significant increases \nin  fruit  and vegetable  production  will  accrue  from  private  farmers.  The  increase in demand  for \nlabor  arising  from  increased  on-farm  production  activities  will  be  about  220,000  person \ndays/year (11.5 days/ha). \n \nApart  from  the  quantified  benefits,  benefits  for  the  NVDA  component  will  come  from \n16. \nimprovements  in  water  management  through  the  establishment  of  and  training  for  WUAs  and \nfarmers to operate, maintain, and manage their irrigation systems. Crop diversification impacts \ntoward  higher  value  outputs \nfrom  on-farm  demonstrations  may  also  be \nunderestimated.  Increases  in  livestock  production  that  arise  because  of  increased  fodder \nproduction with the Project have also not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n17. \nBenefits: Bank erosion and flood management. The flood embankment at Yangi Qala \nand  headworks  at  Yetim  Tapa  on  the  Amu  Darya  river  will  protect  agricultural  land  and  rural \ninfrastructure from flood damage and destruction by river bank erosion. The annual flooding can \ncause significant damage in this area, especially in high flow years. \n \n\nresulting \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          81           \n\nEconomic Analysis of the Project \n\nThe area to be protected by the 6 km embankment at Yangi Qala and the headworks on \n18. \nthe  Yetim  Tapa  canal  includes  5,000  ha  of  cultivated  land,  several  villages,  and  Yangi  Qala \ntown. Benefits accrue from the prevention of the damage that regularly occurs at present. Based \non  data  from  the  area,  the  analysis  assumes  that  a  50-year  flood  (occurring  once  every  50 \nyears) destroys the entire summer crop, and a 5-year flood will severely damage 20% of the rice \ncrop.  Other  floods  may  occur,  with  varying  degrees  of  damage  caused,  but  they  are  not \nquantified  for  this  analysis.  Furthermore,  bank  erosion  leads  to  the  loss  of  an  estimated  60 \nha/year of crop land and 10 ha/year of grazing land, as well as to the annual loss of houses and \nrelated  buildings  with  an  average  value  of  $25,000.  The  annual  value  of  crop  losses  is \nestimated at $0.56 million and the annual value of production lost from eroded land at a further \n$0.21  million.4 Large  floods  have  caused  significant  damage  to  buildings  and  infrastructure  in \nYangi Qala town. The annual value of this loss is estimated at $0.2 million. An estimate is also \nincluded for the cost of relocating households that are losing land and houses as a result of river \nerosion. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nOverall, the first tranche project has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 18.0%. \nA  20%  in  increase  in  project  costs  would  reduce  this  EIRR  to  14.0%  and  a  20%  decrease  in \nbenefits  decrease  it  to  12.9%.  A  simultaneous  increase  in  costs  of  10%  and  reduction  in \nbenefits  of  10%  would  lead  to  an  EIRR  of  13.5%.  The  switching  value  at  12%  for  costs  is \n+31.6% and for benefits is \u201323.2%. A delay of 2 years in achieving benefits would result in an \nEIRR of 13.9%. \n \nThe NBD component has an EIRR of 16.9%. A 20% increase in costs for this component \n20. \nreduces the EIRR to 12.7%, while a 20% decrease in benefits would result in an EIRR of only \n11.4%. A simultaneous increase in costs of 10% and reduction in benefits of 10% would lead to \nan EIRR of 12.1%.  Switching values are +23.9% for costs and \u201317.9% for benefits. Crop yield \nincreases achieved have a greater impact on these results than the increase in irrigated area. \n \n21. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  NVDA  improvement  component  is  18.4%.  A  20%  increase  in  costs \nwould  produce  an  EIRR  of  13.9%,  and  a  20%  decrease  in  benefits  an  EIRR  of  12.6%.  The \ncombination of a 10% increase in costs and 10% decrease in benefits gives an EIRR of 13.3%. \nSwitching  values  at  12%  are  +29.5%  for  costs  and  \u201321.9%  for  benefits.  The  economic \nindicators for this component are robust for variations in key variables. \n \nThe  EIRR  for  the  flood  management  component  is  20.4%.  The  combination  of  a  10% \n22. \nincrease in costs and a 10% decrease in benefits would give an EIRR of 17.6%, while a 20% \nincrease in costs alone produces an EIRR of 17.6%, and a 20% decrease in benefits an EIRR \nof  17.5%.  Switching  values  are  +85.9%  for  costs  and  \u201352.1%  for  benefits,  making  this \ncomponent extremely robust. \n \nE. \n \nThe Project will have a positive impact on household incomes and food security and will \n23. \ncontribute  to  the  reduction  of  poverty.  In  the  Northern  Basins,  the  demand  for  farm  labor  will \nincrease  due  to  the  larger  cropped  area  and  the  expected  increases  in  cropping  intensity,  but \nincreases per ha are not large and likely to be met within households themselves. \n \n\nAssessment of Financial Impacts \n\n                                                 \n4   The value of production from eroded land is cumulative and increases by $0.21 million per year. \n\n \n\n\f82          Appendix 12 \n \n\nThe  financial  impact  of  the  project  on  farm  households  will  vary  by  location  within  the \n24. \nirrigation system, with impacts directly related to the relative increase in water availability. The \ngreatest  impact  on  households  under  the  NBD  component  will  be  for  those  along  the  Aqcha, \nCharboloc, and Faizabad canals below Bangala weir. On average, it is expected that the farm \nincome of the households in the head reaches of these canals will increase by AF8,600/ha/year \n($172),  or  8.2%  of  present  average  income.  In  the  middle  reaches  of  the  canals,  household \nincomes will increase by an average AF12,200/ha/year ($244), or 17.3% of present income. The \ngreatest  impact  will  occur  in  the  tail  reaches  of  the  canals;  although  average  household  farm \nincome is estimated to increase by only AF4,600/ha/year ($92), this represents an increase of \n27.5% over the present situation. \n \n25. \nRehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  main  canal  structures  generates  small  increases  in \nhousehold farm income throughout the Lower Balkh irrigation system. These include an average \nof  (i)  AF2,450/ha/year  ($49)  for  households  in  the  head  reaches,  or  2.3%  of  present  farm \nincome; (ii)  AF2,450/ha/year ($49)  for households along middle reaches, or a 3.5% increase; \nand  (iii)  AF1,050/ha/year  ($21)  along  tail  reaches,  representing  an  increase  of  6.2%  from \npresent levels. \n \n26. \nFor  NVDA  Improvement,  increases  in  private  farm  household  incomes  from  the \nexpected  changes  in  cropped  area,  crop  yields  and  cropping  patterns  are  estimated  to  be \nAF20,300/ha/year  ($406  or  8.6%)  in  the  head  reaches  of  canals,  AF23,400/ha/year  ($468,  or \n12.9%) in the middle reaches, and AF23,000/ha/year ($460, or 21.1%) in the tail reaches. Farm \nincomes are higher in this area than in the Northern Basins and the benefits are larger because \nthe  cropping  pattern  is  more  diversified  and  there  is  greater  emphasis  on  the  production  of \nhigher-value crops. \n \n27. \nThe bank erosion and flood management component, while protecting households from \npotential  losses  of  income  and  assets,  will  have  no  direct  impact  on  household  incomes  for \nthose living in the area affected by the proposed embankment and headworks. \n \nF. \n \nThe increases in farm household income anticipated with the Project will reduce overall \n28. \npoverty  levels  in  the  project  areas.  However,  specific  impacts  on  households  are  difficult  to \nassess.  Average  household  size  is  assumed  to  be  seven  persons, 5 for  which  the  average \nannual  household  income  (at  the  poverty  line  income  of  $14/person/month)  would  be  $1,176 \n(AF58,800).  In  the  NBD  component,  an  average  family  on  the  head  reach  of  a  canal  would \nrequire 0.56 ha to achieve this income at present, compared with 0.83 ha on a middle reach and \n3.5  ha  on  a  tail  reach.  With  implementation  of  the  Bangala  weir,  average  households  on  the \nAqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals would be able to achieve the poverty level income with \n0.52 ha on the head, 0.71 ha on the middle, and 2.75 ha on the tail reaches. Rehabilitation and \nupgrading of main canal structures will have similar but smaller impacts. Many households have \nsmall holdings of less than 1 ha; where these are located on the head and middle reaches of \ncanals,  the  Project  will  enable  some\u2014and  possibly  a  significant  number\u2014of  households  to \nmove  above  the  poverty  line.  While  the  absolute  poverty  reduction  impact  in  the  tail  reaches \nmay be smaller, the relative impact will be larger. \n \n\nPoverty Impacts of the Project \n\n                                                 \n5   Information on household size for the Northern Basins and the NVDA area is sparse and probably not reliable.  The \naverage of seven people per household that was used is an indicative figure, based on: World Food Programme \nand Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 2004. National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. Kabul.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          83           \n\nIn the NVDA area, an average household requires between 0.54 ha and 0.25 ha in the \n29. \ntail and head reaches for household farm income to be above the poverty level at present, and \nabout between about 0.44 ha and 0.23 ha with the Project. While average farm sizes are small, \nthe relative productivity of private farms in the NVDA area suggests that poverty levels for those \nwith  landholdings  are  relatively  low.  However,  households  that  depend  only  on  the  farming  of \nleased state land would have household incomes below the poverty line both without and with \nthe Project.6 \n \n30. \nbasins, 58% for the NVDA, and 49% for the flood management components. \n\nPoverty impact ratios were calculated for each component and are 56% for the northern \n\n \nTable A12.3: Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis \n\nNorthern \nBasins \n\nNVDA \n\nBank \nErosion and \nFlood \nManagement  \n\nProject  \n(first tranche) \n\n ($ million/year) \n\nInvestment cost ($ million) (base costs) b \n\nEconomic NPV ($ million) \nEIRR and sensitivity \n\nCommand Area (ha) \nGeographic area \nIncremental cropped area \nBenefits at full development  \n\na.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  (ANDS)  recognizes  the  need  to  sustain  high  growth  rates  in  the  medium \nterm to generate employment and reduce poverty.a Agriculture generates about 50% of gross domestic product and employs \nabout two thirds of all Afghans; 19 million people (or nearly 80% of the population) live in rural areas, which have the highest \nincidence of poverty. Agricultural and rural economic growth are essential for sustained improvement in national livelihoods. \nReliable irrigation water is critical to achieving this growth, because irrigated agriculture produces 80% all agricultural output. \nTo achieve the Government\u2019s poverty-reduction goals, economic growth has to be accelerated and supported by a sustained \nincrease of 5%\u20138% per year in the agriculture sector. Growth of the agricultural sector will in large part determine the rate of \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and reliable irrigation water is essential to agricultural growth in Afghanistan. \n \nAccording to data from the 2005 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment data, about 45% of the rural population is poor, \nas opposed to 27% of those who live in urban areas.b  Rural populations have the highest rates of food insecurity, with 45% \nnot  meeting  minimum  food  requirements.  In  addition  to  facing  high  food  insecurity,  rural  households  have  less  access  to \ninfrastructure and basic public services. Their level of education is low and rates of illiteracy high. \n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  fully  aligned  with  ANDS  priorities  and \noutcomes, and the CPS highlights four sectors for ADB investments: (i) energy; (ii) transportation and communication; and (iii) \nagriculture and natural resources, including irrigation and water resources management; and (iv) governance.c \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (geographic) \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s  human  development  indicators  are  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.d  Some  12  million  Afghans,  or  42%  of  the \npopulation,  live  below  the  poverty  line,  with  monthly  incomes  of  about  $14  per  capita.  About  45%  of  the  population  is \nestimated to be unable to purchase sufficient food to guarantee the world standard minimum food intake of 2,100 calories per \nday.e  The  national  literacy  rate  was  only  28%  in  2008,  and  the  literacy  rate  among  women  only  16%.  Only  31%  of  the \npopulation has access to safe drinking water, and 12% is believed to have access to sanitation. In addition, life expectancy in \nAfghanistan is under 45 years, at least 10 years below that of any other Asian country. Over 20% of all Afghan children die \nbefore the age of 5, half of Afghanistan\u2019s school-age children are not in school, and 57% of the population is under 18 years \nof age. Gender inequality is rife across all sectors, resulting in particularly difficult circumstances for women.f \n \nA number of factors have contributed to the country\u2019s overall high poverty incidence, but it has primarily been a result of 30 \nyears  of  civil  conflict,  and  the  associated  political  instability  and  lack  of  security,  which  stifled  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. The coincident arrivals of returning refugees and internally displaced people (IDP) and the resultant growth in \nlandlessness have in some areas increased pressure on the resource base beyond sustainable levels. The information below \nwas  collected  under  the  social  assessment  carried  out  in  the  project  areas  during  the  preparation  of  the  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Investment Program. \n \n(i) \n\nIn Imam Sahib District, 65% to 90% of families in the area close to the flooding and bank erosion along the Amu Darya \nRiver  are  below  the  poverty  line.  These  high  poverty  rates  are  due  to  the  ongoing  river  bank  erosion  and  the \ndisplacement of a large number of families and villages. \n\n(ii)  The lower Balkh River Basin has an average poverty rate among all villages of about 70%; 83% of families interviewed \n\nwere below the poverty line in Khulm district, and 65% in Balkh district.  \n\n(iii)  In the Nangahar Valley Development Authority (NVDA) area, the poverty incidence ranges from 44% to 88% in Beshood \n\ndistrict, where there are large numbers of IDP and returnees. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f Appendix 13           85 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  main  livelihood  activities  in  the  project  areas  include  irrigated  agriculture,  livestock,  and  hired  labor.  The  proportion  of \nfamilies  that  are  landless  range  from  about  28%  in  Amu  Darya  basin  to  95%  in  the  Jalalabad  area  due  to  the  influx  of \nreturning  refugees  and  IDP.  Limited  farm  production  arising  from  poor  water  availability  and  the  lack  of  employment \nopportunities are key social issues. Crop losses are reported in all areas, mainly due to the unreliable water supply, which is \nchronic at the tail end of many irrigation canals. In addition, bank erosion and flooding have negatively affected farm output in \nthe  villages  along  the  Amu  Darya  River.  At  the  time  of  the  field  assessment,  few  households  had  surplus  grain  to  sell:  the \nassessment recorded zero in Nangahar, and 17% in the Yangi Qala area. The rural labor pool is increasing with many unable \nto find work opportunities.  \n \nThe Project's northern basins development component will improve water reliability in the irrigated areas of the Lower Balkh \nRiver Basin resulting in increased yields, expanded irrigated area, and increased cropping intensities, This will translate into \nhigher incomes for farm families. The impact will be more pronounced in the tail reaches of the command areas. The size of \nthe population that benefits will depend on the amount of irrigation water available, but in many years, up to 500,000 persons \ncould  directly  benefit  from  the  improvements  (assuming  an  average  family  size  of  seven  people).  Similar  benefits  will  be \ngenerated by the project in the NVDA area, but given the smaller size of the irrigated area, about 150,000 persons will directly \nbenefit  from  the  irrigated  agricultural  productivity.  The  increased  agricultural  productivity  will  also  support  substantial \nadditional labor opportunities, much of which may be captured by family members, and stimulate value chains associated with \nagricultural  production.  While  many  families  in  the  area  may  not  directly  benefit  through  higher  incomes  from  bank  erosion \nand  flood  protection,  many  in  the  area  will  have  a  much  lower  risk  of  losing  productive  assets.  There  are  approximately \n240,000 persons in the Yangi Qala area and Iman Sahib, although not all of them are at risk of floods. However, the flood risk \nprotection for the Yetim Tapa irrigation system will directly benefit close to 40,000 persons.g \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations  were  undertaken  by  the  project  preparation  consultants  with  farmer  irrigators,  the  landless,  sharecroppers, \nherders,  community  elders,  officials  from  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs),  and  government  authorities.  In  addition, \nsmall  workshops and meetings  were held  in each of the project component areas, and a large final tripartite  workshop  was \nheld  in  Kabul  at  the  end  of  the  project  preparation.  The  views  of  the  communities  and  proposed  project  beneficiaries  were \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  Consultation  is  integral  to  the  project  design  with  regard  to  the  development  of  water \nusers associations (WUAs), which will be empowered to assume formal responsibility for the management and operation and \nmaintenance  of  large  portions  of  the  irrigation  system,  and  will  share  decision-making  responsibility  for  infrastructure \nimprovements. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  \n \nDuring project implementation, there  will be significant interaction  with the local  farmers as a part of the WUA development \nand training program. Local NGOs will support implementation of this effort, which by its very nature will be participatory and \ninvolve ongoing consultation with farmers and community members.  \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n \nField  assessments  indicated  that  gender  roles  in  the  project  areas  are  determined  by  tradition,  with  women  engaged  in \nselected activities, of which homemaking is the most important. The percentage of families headed by women ranges from 3% \nto 10%. Women are concerned about the lack of food, income, work opportunities, and health facilities, and by drinking water \nshortages. They are concerned about not enjoying the freedom to work on income generation projects (which stems mainly \nfrom cultural reasons).  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  not  expected  to  explicitly  address  existing  gender  concerns  and  has  few  activities  to  address \nongoing  gender  differences  or  to  create  a  high  gender  impact.  Because  gender  roles  are  unlikely  to  change  and  the \nInvestment Program's  main activities do not  address gender  concerns, there are unlikely  to be any gender impacts resulting \n\n \n\n \n\n\f86         Appendix 13 \n\nfrom  implementation  of  the  project.  However,  to  address  gender-related  concerns  associated  with  irrigation,  the  project  will \nimprove  access  sites  at  irrigation  canals  where  women  traditionally  gather  to  wash  clothes  and  collect  water.  Under  the \nproject,  the  gender  specialist  will  work  with  the  WUAs  and  community  development  councils  to  solicit  women's  view  on  the \ndesign  and  location  of  the  access  points.  This  intervention  along  with  possible  other  interventions  will  be  scaled  up  in \nsubsequent tranches with irrigation activities. \n\n2.  Key  Actions.

The  Afghanistan  Water  Resource  Development  Investment \nProgram  (the  Investment  Program)  will  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  due  to \nimproved  water  resources  management  through  infrastructure  development,  capacity  building, \nand institutional strengthening. The first tranche includes three investment components: (i) the \nnorthern basins development (NBD) component will take place in the Lower Balkh River Basin \nand  support  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  and  development  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  and \ncapacity and institutional development for the river basin agency and water user associations; (ii) \nthe  Nangahar  Valley  Development  Authority  (NVDA)  improvement  component  will  support \nrehabilitation and upgrading of the NVDA irrigation systems, and the development of WUAs and \na corporate business plan for NVDA; and (iii) the flood management component will construct a \nflood embankment and bank protection works. \n \n2. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  was  prepared  that  outlines  the \npolicy,  procedures  and  institutional  requirements  for  preparing  and  implementing  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for  interventions  under  the  Investment  Program. \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program  has  currently  been  classified  as  resettlement \ncategory  B.  Both  the  NBD  and  flood  management  components  have  limited  associated \nresettlement  activities,  and  short  LARPs  have  been  prepared.  Farm  land  compensation  is \nrequired for (i) five families on the proposed Bangala weir site under the NBD component, and \n(ii) 19 families on the proposed embankment site under the flood management component. In \nboth  cases,  no  household  relocation  is  required  and  the  impacts  are  minimal.  The  LARF  and \nshort LARPs can be found in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n3. \nin  accordance  with \nAfghanistan\u2019s  land  expropriation  act  (2000)  and  its  amendment  (2005)  and  relevant  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policies, in particular, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand Operations Manual.1  \n \n4. \nResettlement  principles,  entitlements,  and  procedures.  The  LARF  applies  to  all \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  arising  from  land  acquisition  and/or  conversion,  or  any  other \nimpacts that arise from the Investment Program, including to people with no formal title to land. \nThe  LARF  principles  include  the  following:  (i)  potential  impacts  on  affected  peoples  should  be \navoided  or  minimized;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  unavoidable,  affected  persons  will  be  identified  and \nassisted in maintaining their standards of living at pre-project level; (iii) attention will be paid to \nidentify  the  presence  of  and  involve  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  indigenous \npeople;2 (iv) information on the preparation and implementation of the LARF will be disclosed to \nall  affected  persons  and  their  involvement  throughout  the  process  will  be  ensured;  (v)  land \nacquisition  and  compensation  will  be  paid  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \npolicy and the country\u2019s relevant laws; (vi) affected persons will be paid compensation for their \nlands,  properties,  and  assets  prior  to  taking  the  acquired  land  and  assets;  (vii)  an  entitlement \nmatrix  will  include  details  of  entitlements  for  all  affected  persons,  including  compensation  at \nreplacement  costs,  allowances,  income  restoration  and  livelihood  improvement;  and  (viii) \nvulnerable  households  and  persons  will  receive  a  further  cash  allowance  of  20%  of  the \nresettlement costs. \n\nResettlement  policy.

Affected persons will be \nprovided with free planting materials, or paid the cost of the materials.  \n\n \n8. \nInitial asset valuation will be the responsibility of the project management office (PMO), \nexecuted with support of the implementation consultants, which will be verified and certified by \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14          91           \n\nthe  regional  property  valuation  team  headed  by  the  senior  property  supervisor,  and  then \napproved  by  the  implementing  agency  (IA).  If  the  land  or  property  is  being  acquired  with  the \nowners' consent, this valuation will be used as the basis of negotiation between the owners and \nthe local authorities. \n \n9. \nInstitutional  responsibilities,  arrangements,  and  procedures.  Two  PMOs  will  be \nestablished within the IAs: one within the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) for the NBD and \nflood management components, and the second within the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and \nLivestock  (MAIL)  for  the  NVDA  improvement  component.  The  PMOs  have  overall  planning, \nsupervising,  monitoring,  and  coordination  responsibilities  for  preparing  and  executing  LARPs \nunder  the  Investment  Program. 3 The  actual  work  will  be  undertaken  by  the  specialists  and \nconsultants  that  will  be  attached  to  the  PMO  as  well  as  officials  attached  to  relevant  line \nagencies. The PMOs will be responsible for undertaking such activities as surveys, censuses, \npublic consultations and information disclosures, grievance redress, monitoring, the preparation \nof  LARPs  and  their  dissemination  in  local  languages;  line  agencies  will  be  responsible  for \nactivities such as land surveying, title registration, land acquisition, compensation payment, and \nrelocation, as the agencies have the authority to undertake such activities under prevailing law. \nThe PMO will be assisted as needed by a nongovernment organization (NGO) to work with local \ncommunities  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  LARPs.  LARP  final  drafts  will  be \nsubmitted for approval of both the IA and ADB.4 \n\n \n10. \nDisclosure,  consultation,  and  grievances. The consultation with all affected persons \nwill be an ongoing process throughout LARP planning and implementation. Affected persons will \nbe fully informed of all steps in the planning and implementation of the process. All information \nincluding the entitlement matrix will be disclosed to affected persons in the local language. Local \nchannels  for  information  disclosure  (such  as  announcements  at  market  days)  will  be  planned \nand implemented as part of the information disclosure process. A grievance redress process will \nbe  implemented  in  respect  of  all  activities  under  the  Investment  Program  where  resettlement \nactions are required. The grievance redress will be facilitated by the community and supported \nby an NGO as required. The procedures for the grievance resolution process are based on the \nproject implementation arrangements involving the PMO and IA; if the process is unsuccessful, \nthe  affected  persons  will  have  the  option  of  addressing  their  grievances  through  formal  court \nprocedures, with the support of an NGO. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Grievance Resolution Process \n\nLand and Crops Compensation Issues \n1.  Grievance  resolution  will  be  attempted  through  a  district  committee  comprised  of  the  district  governor,  senior \ndistrict property supervisor, and implementation NGO. \n2. In absence of a settlement, affected persons may appeal to the PMO director. The director will decide the case within 15 \ndays and inform the affected person. \n3. If the PMO decision is unacceptable to the affected persons, they can register their complaint directly with the IA within \n1 month of receiving a response from the PMO, with documents to support their claim. The IA will respond within 15 days \nof registering the complaint. The IA\u2019s decision must be in compliance with the LARF provisions. \n4.  Should  all  three  levels  of  this  grievance  redress  system  fail  to  satisfy  the  affected  person,  he  or  she  may \napproach the appropriate court of law for resolution of the grievance. The affected person will be facilitated in this \nprocess by an implementing NGO.  \nIA = implementing agency, LARF = land acquisition and resettlement framework, NGO = nongovernment organization, \nPMO = project management office.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n                                                 \n3 It is not anticipated that any resettlement activities will be required under the NVDA component. \n4 If the final designs have to be changed, the resettlement plans will be modified, including the completion of a new \n\nsocial assessment, and the revised resettlement plans will be submitted to the IA and ADB for their approval. \n\n \n\n\f92          Appendix 14 \n \n\n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. The PMO will establish a monitoring and evaluation system \nfor  each  project  involving  land  acquisition.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  includes  an \ninternal  monitoring  program  to  be  planned  and  implemented  by  the  PMO.  In  addition,  an \nexternal  monitoring  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  external  monitoring  agency  to  be \nrecruited  and  appointed  by  the  PMO  after  ADB  approval.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be \nestablished  as  appropriate.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  file  independent  monitoring \nreports.  \n \nResettlement cost. Each LARP will have its own costs, which will be part of the overall \n12. \nbudget for the investment tranche. The resettlement cost will include compensation, allowances, \nand  implementation  support  costs.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  agreed  to  pay \nresettlement  compensation  costs.  For  the  first  tranche,  all  costs  have  been  calculated  and \nincluded for updating and implementing the short LARP and associated compensation.\u00a0\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 August 2009) \n", "Currency Unit \nAF1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "afghani/s (AF) \n$0.0203 \nAF49.33 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nANDS \nDMF \nEA \nEARF \nEIA \nEIRR \nEIRRP \n", "EMP \nFFA \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nIWRM \nLARF \nMAIL \nMEW \nMFF \nMOF \nM&E \nNBD \nNCB \nNGO \nNVDA \nO&M \nPDF \nPFR \nPIO \nPMO \nPPMS \nPPTA \nPSC \nQBS \nRBA \nRBC \nSLARP \nTA \nUSAID \nWUA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy \ndesign and monitoring framework \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction \nProject (traditional irrigation component) \nenvironmental management plans \nframework financing agreement \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nintegrated water resources management \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \nMinistry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock \nMinistry of Energy and Water \nmultitranche financing facility \nMinistry of Finance \nmonitoring and evaluation \nnorthern basins development \nnational competitive bidding \nnongovernment organization \nNangahar Valley Development Authority \noperation and maintenance \nprogram development facility \nperiodic financing request \nproject implementation office \nproject management office \nproject performance management system  \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nprogram steering committee \nquality-based selection \nriver basin agency \nriver basin council \nshort land acquisition and resettlement plan \ntechnical assistance \nUnited States Agency for International Development \nwater users association \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ha\nkm\nm3\n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "hectares \nkilometer \ncubic meter \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 20 March.
