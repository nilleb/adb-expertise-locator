The \nInvestment  Program  has  an  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  and  cumulative  environmental  impact \nassessment.  Each  project  under  the  MFF  will  have  individual \nsafeguard documents as required by ADB. The first tranche had \nan  initial  environmental  examination  and  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category B according to ADB guidelines. \n   \nProgram Description  The Investment Program is consistent with the Afghanistan National \nDevelopment Strategy (ANDS), which was approved in April 2009 \nand constitutes the country\u2019s strategic platform for development for \n2008\u20132020. Its aim is to promote growth, generate wealth, and \nreduce poverty and vulnerability. ANDS covers all key sectors and \nsubsectors, and embraces several themes. Water resources is a \nmajor  sector  under  ANDS,  which  provides  a  programmatic \napproach to developing the water sector that includes (i) physical \ninvestments in rehabilitation of existing and development of new \nwater resources and irrigation infrastructure; and (ii) nonphysical \ninvestment in capacity building, strengthened institutions, and policy \nframeworks. The proposed MFF finances the medium-term portion \nof  a  broader  investment  program.  The  Investment  Program  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Afghanistan  country  partnership  strategy \n(CPS)  2009\u20132013,  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020), and water policy Water for All. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  finance  (i)  the  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading of existing and development of new irrigation and water \nresources infrastructure, (ii) flood management infrastructure, (iii) \ninstitutional strengthening, and (iv) capacity building for key staff \nthroughout  the  sector.  The  first  tranche  project  has  four \ncomponents: (i) northern basins development (NBD) that includes ", "ii   \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  and \ndevelopment  of  a  river  basin  agency  (RBA)  and  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) for water management; (ii) Nangahar Valley \nDevelopment  Authority  (NVDA)  improvement  that  includes \nirrigation rehabilitation and upgrading, development of WUAs, and \na management reform plan for the NVDA; (iii) flood management \nthat includes development of flood protection infrastructure along \nthe  Amu  Darya  River  and  development  of  a  national  flood \nmanagement program; and (iv) project management and program \ndevelopment  that  includes  a  program  development  facility  to \nprepare the subsequent two tranches of the MFF. \n   \nMFF Modality  The MFF is proposed as the modality to extend ADB financing to \nthe Investment Program for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  It provides flexibility to the authorities and ADB. Within the \nproposed maximum financing of $303.3 million equivalent, \nADB  and  the  Government  can  modify  the  amount  and \ntiming of contributions under each tranche. \n(ii)  Financing is aligned with project readiness. \n(iii)  The MFF allows ADB to enter into a long-term partnership, \nthereby creating a stable financing plan and platform for \nsector development. It provides physical and nonphysical \ninvestments. \n(iv)  A program loan would help improve policies but not capital \ninvestments. An MFF allows ADB and the Government to \nshift time and resources away from repetitive processing \ntasks into implementation work.  \n \nADB will provide grants to finance projects under the MFF when \nthe projects are ready for financing, and upon submission of a \nsatisfactory  periodic  financing  request  (PFR).  Each  grant  will \nconstitute a tranche and may carry financing terms different from \nthe terms of previous or later tranches. The choice of financing \nterms will depend on the project and ADB\u2019s financing policies at \nthe  time  the  grant  is  made.  Tranches  may  be  provided  in \nsequence or simultaneously, and may overlap. \n \nThe projects corresponding to individual tranches may comprise \nprojects, subprojects, their subcomponents, and/or other physical \nand nonphysical components of the Investment Program. \n \nAll the necessary conditions for the use of an MFF are in place: a \nstrategic framework, a policy framework, an investment program, \nand a tentative financing plan. \n   \nRationale  Water  resources  in  Afghanistan.  Sound  management  and \ndevelopment of Afghanistan\u2019s water resources are essential for \nsustained economic growth. Afghanistan is arid, and precipitation \nvaries substantially both geographically and over the course of the \nyear, with most precipitation falling between November and April. \nThe seasonal precipitation pattern leads to annual flooding; this ", "  iii\ncauses  significant  economic  losses  in  some  areas,  but  also \nprovides  potential  opportunities.  Harnessing  available  water \nresources  where  and  when  they  occur\u2014and  exploiting  these \nresources  most  efficiently  for  irrigated  agriculture  and  other \nuses\u2014are key challenges. \n \nAgricultural economy. Agriculture employs about two thirds of \nthe population and comprises up to half of Afghanistan\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product.  However,  agricultural  production  fluctuates \nyearly because of climatic conditions, and irrigation is necessary \nin most areas for reliable agriculture. Irrigated agriculture accounts \nfor about 80% of crop production. Almost 85% of Afghanistan\u2019s \ninhabitants live in rural areas, and are either directly or indirectly \ndependent  on  agriculture.  Improved  access  to  irrigation  is \nnecessary for rural economic growth and improved livelihoods. \n \nIrrigation  sector.  Afghanistan  has  approximately  6.5  million \nhectares (ha) of arable land. By the mid-1970s, over 3 million ha \nreceived  irrigation,  and  irrigation  uses  95%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \ndeveloped  water  supplies.  Today,  1.8  million  ha  have  regular \nirrigation. About 80% of irrigated lands have been developed and \nmanaged by local communities in river valleys, and these systems \nare  old  and  degraded.  Improving  the  performance  of  these \nexisting  traditional  irrigation  systems  is  necessary  to  boost \nagricultural production.  \n \nModern  irrigation  systems  under  state  control  were  developed \nwith foreign aid over the last 50 years. The NVDA near Jalalabad \nwas established by the former Soviet Union under a collective \nfarm model. It is currently operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, \nIrrigation, and Livestock (MAIL). The systems support perennial \nirrigation on 20,000 ha of prime agricultural land, of which 12,000 \nha are privately owned, with most of the remainder on short-term \nleases  to  small  farmers.  All  physical  aspects  of  the  irrigation \nsystem need rehabilitation. The Government also needs support \nto  develop  a  business  plan  to  restructure  NVDA  (currently  an \ninefficient state enterprise) and increase its corporate orientation. \n \nSeasonal  flooding. In many areas, annual flooding and bank \nerosion results in damage to irrigation systems and the loss of \nprime agricultural land, rural infrastructure, and other assets. This \nproblem is particularly acute in the upper Amu Darya River that \nborders  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan.  ADB  is  implementing  the \nPyanj River Basin Flood Management Project to address flood \nissues,  but  infrastructure  investment  is  needed  to  remedy \nproblems, and Afghanistan currently has little flood management \ncapacity.  \n   \nProgram Investment Plan  ANDS proposed an investment program for $3,761 million for the \nentire water sector. The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) has \nrevised  the  ANDS  investment  plan  to  $2,468  million  over  the \nmedium-term under the national programs for irrigation and water \n ", "iv   \nresources management that include: (i) Institutional Set-Up and \nCapacity  Building  Program,  (ii)  Water  Resource  Infrastructure \nManagement  Program,  (iii)  Bank  Protection  Program,  and  (iv) \nNational  Water  Resources  Development  Program.  The \nGovernment has asked ADB to finance a portion of the water \nsector investment program and to support it over 10 years through \nan MFF (Table 1). The amount proposed is up to $303.3 million \nequivalent. A set of investments has been and will be prepared \nunder  the  ADB  Investment  Program.  The  investments  will  be \nfinanced in three tranches, with the first tranche totaling $92.8 \nmillion inclusive of in-kind support for operations and maintenance \nfrom project beneficiaries. Table 2 provides estimates for each of \nthe  first-tranche  components.

Tranche \n1  will  involve  cofinancing  of  $3.3  million  equivalent  from  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom (to be administered by ADB). \nADB  financing  will  be  provided  as  grants  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  in  accordance  with  relevant  ADB  policies, \nsubject  to modifications  that  may  be  included  under  individual \nfinancing  agreements.  The  implementation  period  will  be  10 \nyears. The Investment Program will consist of individual tranches, \nthe terms of which may vary. The MFF will finance civil works, \nequipment and goods, consulting services, and recurrent costs. \n \nThe Government will submit a PFR for each tranche, which will be \nreviewed by ADB in accordance with the Framework Financing \nAgreement (FFA) and ADB's then-prevailing policies. If approved, \nfinancing will be provided from the MFF. The Government has \nsubmitted the first PFR, requesting $89.9 million to help finance the \ntranche 1 project. The terms and conditions for subsequent tranches \nwill be subject to (i) the availability of ADB Special Funds resources; \n(ii)  Afghanistan\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nGraduation  Policy  and  Asian  Development  Fund  donor \nrequirements;  and  (iii)  the  availability  of  ADB  Special  Funds \nresources  to  Afghanistan  pursuant  to  then-applicable  policies \nconcerning allocation of, and eligibility for, such funds. Adherence to \n ", "vi   \nundertakings  made  in  the  FFA  and  individual  tranche  financing \nagreement covenants will be conditions for financing approval. \n \nThe last date for any disbursements under any tranche will be by \n22 September 2019. Afghanistan is expected to submit the last \nPFR no later than 31 December 2016. \n \nIn addition, as a part of the proposed MFF amount, the Government \nof the United Kingdom will provide a grant in the amount of $3.3 \nmillion  equivalent  in  financing  for  a  Helmand  Basin  Water \nResources  Master  Plan  under  the  Investment  Program.  The \nfinancing plan for tranche 1 is in Table 4. The project participants will \nalso  contribute  $1.9  million  equivalent  of  in-kind  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) support for the first tranche. \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for Tranche 1  \n \n  Amount   \nTranche 1  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank  86.6  93.2 \nGovernment of the United Kingdoma  3.3  3.6 \nGovernment   1.0  1.1 \nProject  participants:  in-kind  irrigation \nO&M from farmers  1.9  2.1 \nTranche 1 Total  92.8  100.0 \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nNote: The table includes estimated amounts for import duties and taxes. \nGovernment  will  pay  resettlement  compensation  costs  and \ncounterpart staff salaries. \na  The grant contribution by the Government of the United Kingdom is \u00a32 \nmillion. This amount also includes ADB's administration fee, audit \ncost, bank charges and provision for foreign exchange fluctuations (if \nany), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest \nand investment income earned on this grant, or any additional grant \ncontribution by the Government of the United Kingdom. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nBesides  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom,  other \ndevelopment  partners  may  determine  to  complement  ADB's \nfinancing after the Board's approval of the proposed MFF through \ncofinancing  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  amounts  of \ncofinancing  to  be  provided  by  all  development  partners  and \nadministered  by  ADB  (including  the  grant  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom)  under  the  Investment \nProgram will be deducted from the total MFF amount approved. \nSuch cofinancing may be provided as grants or loans, and may \ntake the form of joint cofinancing. ADB's administration of such \ncofinancing from time to time will be reported to the Board for \ninformation annually. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 22 September 2019  \n   \nEstimated Project  22 March 2019 \nCompletion Date ", "  vii\nInvestment Program  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for \nExecuting Agency  the Investment Program. \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agencies for the first tranche will be MEW and \nArrangements  MAIL  (the  latter  for  activities  involving  the  NVDA).  A  program \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  MEW  minister  will \nprovide  oversight  and  policy  guidance  for  the  program.  Two \ndedicated project management offices (PMOs) will be established. \nThe  first  PMO  will  be  located  in  Kabul  to  support  the  flood \nmanagement and northern basins development components with \ncentralized services  for  safeguards,  financial management  and \nadministration. Two project implementation offices (PIOs) will be \nestablished, one in Taloqan and one in Mazar-i-Sharif, to support \nthe technical field implementation. A program development facility \n(PDF) to prepare new tranches of the MFF will be housed in the \nMEW PMO in Kabul. The second PMO for the NVDA component \nunder MAIL will be located in Jalalabad with a liaison office in \nKabul. The PMOs will include specialist teams providing support \non technical, legal, finance and administration, safeguards and \ngender,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  and  capacity  and \ninstitutional development issues. The parallel PMO structure for \nMAIL  and  MEW  mitigates  the  risk  of  poor  cooperation  and \nsimplifies financial flows that could lead to implementation delays. \nDue to weak capacity, the PMOs will include international and \nnational  consultants  along  with  counterpart  staff  to  provide \ntechnical and administrative support and capacity development. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the MFF \nwill  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International \ncompetitive bidding will be used for supply contracts estimated to \ncost more than $500,000 and for works of more than $2 million. \nNational competitive bidding will be used for goods and works \nvalued  at  more  than  $100,000  and  below  the  thresholds  for \ninternational competitive bidding. Shopping will be used for goods \nand works equal to or below $100,000. \n \nFor  each  project  financed  under  the  Investment  Program, \nadvance contracting for the procurement of goods and services \nwill  be  permitted,  subject  to  these  being  eligible  according  to \nagreed upon procedures, and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nRetroactive  financing  is  proposed  under  individual  tranches  for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding financing agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% of \nthe  tranche  amount.  The  MOF,  MEW,  and  MAIL  have  been \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed \nprojects. \n   \n ", "viii  \nConsulting Services  The PMOs, PIOs, and PDF will require consulting services for \neffective project implementation and to develop the capacity of \ncounterpart staff. Firms and individuals (national and international) \nwill be engaged to provide services in the following areas, among \nothers: (i) project management, (ii) engineering, (iii) procurement \nand financial management, (iv) safeguards and gender, (v) M&E, \n(vi)  auditing  and  reporting,  (vii)  training  and  institutional \ndevelopment, and (viii) due diligence for subsequent tranches. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nThe least-cost selection method will be used to recruit external \nauditors.  Recruitment  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nand/or  other  service  providers  to  help  prepare  and/or  monitor \nimplementation  of  safeguards,  training  of  WUAs,  or  service \ndelivery of other activities will be recruited on a competitive basis \nacceptable to  ADB.  Individual  consultants  may  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  the  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nrecruitment of individual consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  For  the  first  tranche,  the  NBD  and  NVDA  improvement \nBeneficiaries  components  will  provide  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  an \nirrigation system that supplies about 100,000 ha in the north and \nthe east of the country. This will result in improved agricultural \nproductivity from increased yields, expanded irrigated area, and \nincreased cropping intensities. The estimated economic internal \nrates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  these  components  are  16.9%  and \n18.4%,  respectively.  The  financial  benefits  will  be  greatest  to \nfarmers in the tail-end of the irrigation systems, and those in the \nNorthern Basins may experience an increase in their incomes of \nabout 27%.The third investment component, flood management, \nwill provide flood protection for the Yetim Tapa irrigation system \nand  Yangi  Qala  town,  and  has  an  EIRR  of  20.4%.  The  first \ntranche as a whole has an EIRR of 18.0%.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  following  risks  have  been  identified  with  the  Investment \nProgram and first tranche. \n \nSecurity. Security has been declining in Afghanistan over the last \n3 years and this could delay or in some cases prevent successful \nimplementation  of  interventions  under  the  program.  However, \nlessons drawn from previous activities undertaken in Afghanistan \ncan  mitigate  security  risks.  Project  implementation  will  be \nsupported  with  adequate  resources  for  security,  including \ncommunications,  transport,  and  reinforcement  of  facilities. \nSecurity plans will be developed for each activity with the support \nof the Afghanistan Resident Mission security team, and private as \nwell  as  government  security  personnel  will  be  engaged  as \nrequired. \n ", "  ix\n  Capacity. The technical capacity, project management capacity \nand  financial  management  capacity  of  both  MEW  and  MAIL \nrequire  development.  Experience  has  shown  that  counterpart \ncapacity  is  generally  inadequate  to  support  project \nimplementation,  so  adequate  consultant  input  is  required  to \nensure project effectiveness and timely implementation.

The design \nand monitoring frameworks are in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Sound management and development of water resources are vital for Afghanistan's \nsustained economic growth, particularly in the agricultural sector. However, 30 years of civil \nunrest have severely degraded the country\u2019s water resources infrastructure, and the capacity \nand  institutions  to  manage  and  develop  that  infrastructure.  This  has  devastated  both  the \nproductivity of the agricultural sector, and the rural livelihoods and communities that depend \nupon it (the Problem Tree Analysis is in Appendix 2). \n \n3.  The Government of Afghanistan is addressing this situation through the Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy (ANDS).1 The ANDS lays out the Government's development \nagenda under three pillars: (i) security; (ii) governance, rule of law and human rights; and (iii) \neconomic and social development. The ANDS notes that water plays a key role in economic \ndevelopment, but there has been underinvestment in the sector to date. The ANDS gives the \nhighest  priority  to  water,  and  its  water  sector  development  program  includes  a  mix  of \ninvestments in infrastructure, policy, institutions, and capacity to achieve sustainable sector \ngrowth. The ANDS provides a solid framework to develop the water resources sector, but \nrealizing this will take substantial commitment and investment (the sector analysis, strategy, \nroad map, and investment plan are in Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Water resources in Afghanistan. Much of Afghanistan is arid, and effective water \nresources management has always been a significant national concern. However, Afghanistan\u2019s \noverall water resources endowment is respectable\u2014precipitation is about 165,000 million cubic \nmeters (m3) per year, with yearly runoff of 57,000 million m3, equal to about 2,280 m3 per capita. \nHowever, precipitation varies geographically\u2014averaging about 250 millimeters across most of \nthe country, with as little as 75 millimeters falling in the southwest, and reaching 1,170 mm in \nthe northeast\u2014as well as seasonally, with most falling between November and May. Thus \nalthough much of Afghanistan does not receive adequate precipitation for effective rainfed \nagriculture, some parts of Afghanistan are prone to seasonal flooding due to runoff.2 \n \n5.  Agricultural  economy. Agriculture employs about two thirds of the population and \ncomprises  up  to  half  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product,  but  the  contribution  varies \nconsiderably with yearly climatic conditions (it equaled 53% in 2007, but was only 36% in 2004\u2013\n2005). The seasonal variability and overall arid climate makes irrigation necessary in most \n                                                 \n1  Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  In addition, 80% of Afghanistan's water resources are comprised of snow and ice at elevations above 2,000 \nmeters, and are sensitive to cycles of drought. This poses water resource management challenges with regard to \nclimate change. Improving water management for increased efficiency and development of infrastructure will help \nmitigate the threats posed by climate change. In addition, ADB's Central and West Asia Department is addressing \nclimate change for its clients through ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change Interventions \nin Central and West Asia. Manila (TA 7274-REG). ", "2 \nareas for reliable agriculture, and irrigated agriculture accounts for about 80% of all agricultural \nproduction. Almost 85% of Afghanistan\u2019s inhabitants live in rural areas and are either directly or \nindirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.3 To achieve the Government\u2019s poverty-\nreduction goals, economic growth has to be supported by a sustained increase of 5% to 8% per \nyear  in  the  agricultural  sector.  Development  of  the  agricultural  sector,  which  will  require \nimproved access to irrigation, is essential for economic growth, enhanced livelihoods, and \npoverty reduction. \n \n6.  Irrigation. Irrigation uses 95% of Afghanistan's developed water supplies, and there is \napproximately 6.5 million hectares (ha) of arable land in Afghanistan. By the mid-1970s, an area \nof about 3 million ha received some form of irrigation. Today, about 1.8 million ha receives \nirrigation due to the serious deterioration of irrigation systems from (i) civil unrest and war, (ii) \nfloods, (iii) prolonged droughts, (iv) the breakdown of institutions responsible for their operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  and  management,  and  (v)  a  lack  of  resources  for  O&M  and \nrehabilitation. The vast majority (about 80%) of irrigation systems are traditional, and have been \ndeveloped and managed by local communities over the last several centuries.4 These systems \nrely on technically simple distribution structures, and the river intakes in particular are prone to \ndestruction  from  annual  floods,  and  require  regular  rebuilding.  In  spite  of  their  technical \nsimplicity, a robust traditional management institution exists under the oversight of mirabs5, with \nactive community participation developed over the years to manage the systems. Strengthening \nand transforming the traditional mirab management system that has eroded in recent years into \nlegal water users associations (WUAs), while in parallel providing rehabilitation and upgrading \nfor  irrigation  infrastructure,  is  a  key  challenge  to  improving  the  productivity  of  irrigated \nagriculture. \n \n7.  Modern irrigation systems under state control (i) were developed with foreign aid over \nthe last 50 years, (ii) comprise up to 15% of all irrigated area, (iii) support rural livelihoods, and \n(iv) and are in need of rehabilitation and upgrading and management reform. The Nangahar \nValley Development Authority (NVDA) near Jalalabad was built with assistance from the former \nSoviet  Union  under  a  collective  farm  model.  It  is  currently  operated  by  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture,  Irrigation,  and  Livestock  (MAIL).  The  system\u2014which  has  about  20,000  ha  of \nirrigated land with a perennial supply of water, fertile farmland, and an excellent agricultural \nclimate\u2014is close to markets. About 12,000 ha is privately held and the rest is mainly leased by \nNVDA to small farmers on an annual basis for a single crop of wheat, which represents a \nsignificant underutilization of these assets. All physical aspects of the irrigation system need \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading.  MAIL  also  needs  assistance  to  develop  a  business  plan  to \nrestructure NVDA on a corporate basis, with the goals of using MAIL\u2019s existing assets more \nproductively, and providing sustainable O&M and management of the irrigation system.6 \n \n8.  Flooding. In many areas, seasonal flooding and bank erosion cause annual damage to \nirrigation systems and the loss of agricultural land, rural infrastructure, and other assets. The \nproblems are particularly acute in the upper Amu Darya river, which form the border between \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan. The Afghan side of the border features many low-lying, populated \nareas as the river flows into the flood plain from the mountains. The soil is soft and productive \n                                                 \n3 Afghan farmers also need substantial support relating to agricultural support services and marketing in order to \noptimize returns. \n4 Although developed using basic technology, some of these individual system irrigate more than 10,000 ha. \n5 Mirabs are responsible for management and organization of community O&M of the systems and serve at the \nrequest of the community.  \n6 Assets associated with the NVDA include the irrigation system and land, a machine shop and motorpool, an olive oil \nprocessing plant, buildings, marketing facilities, nurseries and research plots, and residences. ", "  3\nalong the Afghan bank, but few flood protection works have been built. Banks erode regularly, \nespecially during the spring and summer flood season, and numerous villages and up to 10,000 \nha of land has been lost over the last 20 years. ADB is implementing the Pyanj River Basin \nFlood Management Project regional technical assistance (TA)7 project to improve the ability of \nboth countries to address flood issues. However, infrastructure investment is also needed for \nflood management throughout the country. Currently, Afghanistan has little capacity or formal \norganization to address flood management. \n \n9.  Policy and institutional framework. Afghanistan's policy framework related to water \nresources is well designed, but support is needed to build capacity and effective institutions for \nthe framework\u2019s implementation. The new Water Law8 is based on best practice for integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM)  and  establishes  the  overarching  sector  framework.9 \nUnder  the  law,  river  basin  agencies  (RBAs)  and  river  basin  councils  (RBCs)  have  been \nestablished as a decentralized management structure under the Ministry of Energy and Water \n(MEW), which is responsible for development of infrastructure and overall management of water \nresources.10 MEW's  capacity  has  improved  with  regard  to  basic  engineering  and  project \nmanagement, but MEW still requires significant support to fulfill its mandate, especially at the \nregional level. The transition to RBAs and RBCs will require the development of new skills.  \n \n10.  MEW is the lead ministry for water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan, but MAIL has \nresponsibility for small-scale irrigation and on-farm water management. MAIL has very limited \ncapacity for irrigation but has drafted an irrigation sector strategy for its own programs.11 Its \nemphasis is on water harvesting and on-farm water management, with the latter vital to achieve \nthe maximum productivity from the rehabilitation and upgrading of the irrigation system. Donors \nare working with MAIL to develop its capacity, and MAIL will play an increasingly important role \nin irrigated agriculture. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Challenges \n \n11.  The water sector faces tremendous physical and nonphysical challenges that need to be \naddressed in an integrated and sustained way to develop the sector.  \n \na.  Physical Challenges \n \n12.  Water  resources  availability.  On  an average per capita basis,  the  precipitation that \nAfghanistan receives should be sufficient to prevent water scarcity. However, surface water runoff \nis highly seasonal and very unevenly distributed. Over half of Afghanistan's water runoff flows into \nAmu Darya River, much of it in the form of floods; this water is challenging and expensive to \ncapture, and located far from population and economic growth centers. \n \n13.  Transboundary considerations. Over 95% of Afghanistan's water resources are in rivers \nthat flow into neighboring countries. This makes development of water resources more challenging, \nbecause coordination and agreements with riparian neighbors are often needed for development. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

Degraded  infrastructure.  Existing  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure  in \nAfghanistan has received inadequate O&M over the last 30 years and is extremely degraded. \nSignificant rehabilitation and upgrading investment is required to restore existing infrastructure to its \nproductive potential. \n \n15.  Lack  of  new  infrastructure. Although Afghanistan has water that it can harness for \nproductive purposes, it has not invested in new water resources and irrigation infrastructure over \nthe  last  few  decades.  Substantial  investment  is  needed  to  help  Afghanistan  bridge  the  gap \nresulting from 30 years of stagnated economic development. \n \n16.  Inefficient water resources management. Most irrigation in Afghanistan uses traditional \nsystems that are not engineered, are constructed from rudimentary materials, and have degraded \nover the last few decades, resulting in low irrigation efficiency. The lack of investment in new \ninfrastructure has also hampered water user efficiency. On-farm irrigation and water management \nneed to be improved, and would benefit significantly from training and the introduction of more \nefficient irrigation technologies and management practices.  \n \nb.  Nonphysical Challenges \n \n17.  Lack of qualified staff. The decades of conflict and inactivity have seriously affected \nMEW, which has few staff that can contribute to water sector development. Capacity building \nefforts by ADB, the World Bank, and other donors have resulted in improvements, but additional \neffort is required to enable MEW to manage and develop the water sector without external \nassistance. In addition to solidifying basic technical and project management capacity, new \nskills will be required for the RBAs and RBCs to become functional. The current salaries of MEW \nengineers are far below market rates, inhibiting retention of staff. The situation is unlikely to change \nin the short- to medium-term, and the amount and duration of support needed during project \nimplementation exceeds the norm. \n \n18.  Feasibility studies and investment plan. Significant work is being undertaken by ADB, \nthe European Commission, and the World Bank to rehabilitate and upgrade irrigation systems \nthroughout Afghanistan, but little investment is taking place to develop new water resources \ninfrastructure. Although potential new projects exist, investment is constrained by a lack of \nquality feasibility studies to support the realization of new projects and serve as a basis for \nprioritizing investments. MEW contracted the preparation of new feasibility studies to regional \nfirms,  but  many  of  the  studies  need  additional  work  on  technical  options,  economics, \nsafeguards, and other issues to bring them to an international standard that would support ADB \ninvestments. ADB initiated support to MEW to remedy this situation under technical assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Development for Irrigation and Water Resources,12  but additional support is \nneeded. \n \n19.  MEW has a list of priority investments, but it is not fully supported by objective selection \ncriteria or adequate project information. However, even with good feasibility studies, analysis is \nrequired to prioritize and sequence projects, especially in a river basin context, where upstream \ndevelopments can impact downstream projects. The World Bank has initiated modeling efforts \nin the Kabul River Basin to evaluate different development options and scenarios in optimizing a \ndevelopment plan. Additional work is required and is ongoing to (i) develop better feasibility \nstudies to support investment, and (ii) prioritize and sequence investments as the basis of a \ncomprehensive sector investment plan. \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for Capacity Development for Irrigation \nand Water Resources. Manila (TA 4716-AFG). ", "  5\n20.  Lack of water resources knowledge base. Good quality data are required for effective \nwater management and rehabilitation, upgrading and development of water resources and \nirrigation  infrastructure.  A  severe  lack  of  most  data  (e.g.,  surface  and  groundwater  data, \nmeteorological  data,  geotechnical  information,  agricultural  data,  and  water  quality  data) \nconstrains effective planning and management. Monitoring capability is limited by a lack of \ntechnical resources, as well as human capacity to manage data collection and analysis.  An \nintensive  effort  is  needed  to  ensure  that  sector  development  is  not  supported  by  project \ndevelopment in isolation, and that measurement and monitoring systems and the institutions \nand capacity to use them effectively are also put in place. \n \n21.  Operation and maintenance of infrastructure. The Government has limited funds and \ncapacity  for  O&M  of  large  irrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure.  Donor  funds  and \nGovernment general revenues can be used in the short term for recurrent costs, but a longer-\nterm solution is required. Under the Water Law, fees can be charged for water delivery, and the \nGovernment is committed to developing tariff strategies for O&M funds that stay within the \nsector to reduce subsidies and achieve sustainability. Over 80% of irrigation uses traditional \nsystems, and communities have been responsible for O&M for hundreds of years, although \ntraditional  management  has  declined  in  recent  years.  Support  is  required  to  build  on  the \ncommunity management and to establish WUAs under the Water Law. O&M is a challenge, but \nopportunities exist to address it on multiple levels. \n \n22.  On-farm water management and agricultural production. While timely delivery of \nirrigation water is a primary constraint for agricultural production, other issues\u2014including on-\nfarm water management, inputs, access to markets, and post-harvest handling\u2014are binding \nconstraints  to  agricultural  production.  These  production  factors  are  underdeveloped  in \nAfghanistan, and should be addressed with irrigation to maximize productive impact. \n \n23.  Poppy cultivation. Afghanistan currently produces over 90% of the world's opium and \npoppy  production  poses  a  huge  social,  political,  and  security  challenge.  Opportunities  for \nalternative livelihoods are required in rural areas to ease the reliance on the opium economy. \nImproved access to irrigation, especially for higher-value second-season cropping, provides \nenhanced incomes and blunts the strong economic incentives to grow poppy. At the same time, \nassurances are required from communities receiving assistance that they will abstain from \npoppy production, and government interdiction efforts must pose a credible threat. \n \n2.  Water Resources Sector Strategy and Investment Program \n \n24.  The ANDS and the Government's water sector policy framework provide a clear sector \nstrategy and investment program. The ANDS's water sector vision is \"to manage and develop \nthe country's water resources so as to reduce poverty, increase sustainable economic and \nsocial development, improve the quality of life for all Afghans and ensure an adequate supply of \nwater for future generations.\" 13 Underpinning the ANDS is the national Water Sector Strategy, \nwhich addresses all water subsectors including water supply, environment, and hydropower. \nBased  on  a  sector  analysis,  the  ANDS  Water  Sector  Strategy  develops  programs  with \nassociated  investments,  which  include  the  following  for  water  resources  and  irrigation:  (i) \nInstitutional Set-Up and Capacity Building Program, (ii) National Water Resources Development \nProgram, (iii) National River Basin Management Program, (iv) Irrigation Rehabilitation Program, \nand (v) River Bank Protection Program. The most recent MEW investment plan based on the \nANDS programs is about $2.5 billion over the medium term. In addition to the investments, the \n                                                 \n13 Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy: 1387\u20131391 (2008\u20132013). \nKabul (page 84). \n ", "6 \nANDS has a Water Sector Strategic Action Plan that outlines policy, institutional, and capacity \ndevelopment  activities  needed  to  achieve  desired  sector  outcomes.  The  programmatic \napproach of the ANDS, plus the existing legal and policy framework, including the new Water \nLaw, provide the strategic framework to support sector investment. The ANDS programs, their \nobjectives and the initial investment program provide a well-defined road map to guide sector \ninvestment. Refinements are required and are ongoing, and the ADB Investment Program will \nbe updated as better information becomes available and new projects are prepared. \n \n3.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n \n25.  ADB's new country partnership strategy (CPS) for Afghanistan (2009\u20132013)14 is fully \naligned with the ANDS. The CPS highlights four sectors for ADB investments: (i) energy, (ii) \ntransportation and communication, (iii) agriculture and natural resources (including irrigation and \nwater resources), and (iv) governance. The new strategy for the water sector represents a \ncontinuation of the previous objectives from the country strategy and program update (2006\u2013\n2008).15 However, investments and institutions are supported in a more programmatic fashion \nthrough the combination of physical and nonphysical investments under the MFF modality. The \nnew strategy attaches special importance to themes, particularly gender and development, \ncapacity, and private sector development. In addition to the CPS, the Investment Program is \nfully  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),16which \nincludes investment in water resources infrastructure as a core ADB business activity. The \nGovernment's commitment to a policy framework based on IWRM principles contained in the \nWater Law and ANDS is consistent with the ADB water policy, Water for All. \n \n4.  External Assistance  \n \n26.  Water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan have received significant attention over the \nlast 6 years from multiple donors, but infrastructure investment has been lower than in other \nsectors (e.g., roads and power). ADB, the European Commission, and the World Bank have \nbeen the three largest, most consistent donors to the sector with ongoing programs that began \nin 2002. The European Commission has supported a long-term integrated program in the Amu \nDarya and Kundoz basins featuring infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading and institutional \ndevelopment of the RBAs, RBCs, and WUAs. The World Bank has had an ongoing emergency \nrehabilitation and upgrading program that is working throughout the country. The Untied States \nAgency  for  International  Development  has  had  several  rural  development  and  agricultural \nprograms  with  irrigation  and  water  resources  activities,  but  no  dedicated  water  resources \nprogram. Other bilateral donors have supported the sector, including the Government of India \n(through the construction of Salma Dam) and the Canadian International Development Agency, \nwhich is rehabilitating Dahla Dam. To date, ADB has combined an integrated approach\u2014which \nintegrates physical and nonphysical investments\u2014with a geographic focus on the northern and \nwestern portions of the country. A more complete list of sector assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n \n27.  ADB has significant experience in implementing water resources projects in Afghanistan, \nand important lessons can be drawn from these and other ADB projects in Afghanistan, as well as \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2007.

Security risks are present in Afghanistan, but can be mitigated with proper planning, \ncoordination with local authorities and communities, and adequate resources. Security planning \nand associated costs can be significant, and need to be factored into projects from the outset. \n \n29.  Many projects in Afghanistan are behind schedule and prone to related cost overruns. This \nis a function of security concerns and rising investment costs, in part because initial project costing \nand  actual  contracting  may  be  separated  by  years  due  to  delays  in  consultant  recruitment, \npreparation of feasibility studies and detailed designs, and tendering. The MFF modality will help \nmitigate this problem, because projects should be ready to proceed with contracting at the time a \nperiodic financing request (PFR) is submitted. More effective project management offices (PMOs) \nunder a long-term programmatic MFF approach will also improve planning. \n \n30.  Many delays stem from project startup activities (e.g., establishment of the PMO and \ntraining of PMO staff, recruitment of implementation consultants, establishment of financial and \nproject management systems, and awarding of initial civil works contracts). Projects should have \nbetter and more detailed implementation plans, and project implementation manuals at the \noutset.  Effective  use  of  TA  funds  to  advance  project  readiness  beyond  normal  processing \nstandards,  assiduous  support  from  the  resident  mission,  and  additional  support  from  ADB \nheadquarters is required, especially in weakly performing countries such as Afghanistan. This will \nbe facilitated by the joint venture approach taken by the Afghanistan Resident Mission and ADB \nheadquarters. \n \n31.  Capacity is weak across all aspects of project preparation and management. Adequate \nconsulting input is required to ensure that project implementation will proceed irrespective of \ngovernment counterparts and support. Capacity development can be undertaken as a parallel \nactivity through a mix of on-the-job experience and more formal in-country and foreign training. As \ncapacity is developed, greater responsibility can be shifted to government counterparts. \n \n32.  It is very difficult to recruit and retain good consulting services in Afghanistan, so the \nquality-based selection (QBS) procedures should be used to secure qualified staff. QBS also \nprovides  greater  flexibility  in  replacement  of  consultant  staff  from  existing  contracts. \nProcurement is difficult and contractor capacity is weak, so contracting is more manageable \nusing  larger  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contracts  rather  than  multiple  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) contracts. Much of the ICB work is also subcontracted, meaning \nnational  contractor  capacity  is  still  developed  in  the  sector  under  the  ICB  modality,  with \nmanagement by the internationally qualified firms. \n \n33.  Water  resources  and  irrigation  projects  are  most  effective  when  the  development  of \ninfrastructure can provide a tangible, catalytic factor to develop management and O&M capacity for \nWUAs  and  government  agencies.  However,  careful  planning  and  adequate  implementation \nresources are needed to ensure that interlinked physical and nonphysical components are \nphased accordingly. Activities to establish WUAs and RBAs should be undertaken early in a \nproject  so  that  they  can  then  actively  engage  in  and  have  ownership  over  the  planning, \nexecution, management and O&M of civil works. \n                                                 \n17 Previous ADB projects include the ADB. 2003.

O&M and recurrent costs must be an explicit \nconsideration of project design, and capacity building and institutional development related to \nO&M should be provided for government staff and water users. \n \n35.  Regionally  implemented  projects  in  Afghanistan  need  strong  technical  field \nimplementation  capacity,  but  also  require  a  strong  presence  in  Kabul  (i)  to  manage \nprocurement,  financial  management,  and  other  administrative  activities;  (ii)  to  follow-up  on \napprovals from the central authority; and (iii) to ensure close cooperation and support with the \nimplementing  agency(s)  to  (a)  manage  expectations,  (b)  quickly  resolve  implementation \nproblems, and (c) make program adjustments as required. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  WUAs  indicates  that  (i)  WUA  development  is  a  long-term \nprocess,  (ii)  WUAs  need  to  be  involved  in  all  aspects  of  irrigation  development  and \nmanagement, and (iii) WUAs will fail if they lack adequate resources to fulfill their mandate. \nLessons from ADB\u2019s Bali Irrigation Project18 demonstrate the importance of explicitly working \nwithin and strengthening existing traditional irrigation management when introducing any project \nintervention. Not doing so jeopardizes project success, and may also weaken the traditional \nsystems themselves, thereby lowering overall sector performance. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n37.  The Investment Program will increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture as a result \nof  improved  water  resources  management  through  infrastructure  development,  capacity \nbuilding, and institutional strengthening. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  General Investment Program Outputs \n \n38.  The Investment Program's outputs will include (i) physical rehabilitation and upgrading of \nexisting irrigation and water resources infrastructure; (ii) the development of new infrastructure for \nirrigation,  flood  management,  and  water  resources;  (iii)  support  to  develop  and  implement \nimproved  institutional  frameworks  and  policies  for  irrigation,  flood  management,  and  water \nresources  management;  (iv)  programs  to  strengthen  line  agencies,  O&M,  and  management \npractices; and (v) capacity development programs to ensure sustainable outcomes. Outputs will \nalso include PMOs and project implementation offices (PIOs) to ensure efficient development of \ninfrastructure and delivery of services and to provide training for government staff for improved \nproject management. A program development facility (PDF) will be established to prepare new \ntranches of the MFF. \n \n39.  The underlying approach to executing the Investment Program is to develop projects \nthat integrate physical and nonphysical components to comprehensively and holistically address \nsector  needs  to  achieve  desired  outcomes.  This  approach,  combined  with  long-term  ADB \nengagement through the MFF, will provide the support needed to sustainably improve the \nperformance and accelerate development of the water resources sector in Afghanistan. \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1981.

Tranche 1 Outputs \n \n40.  Tranche 1. The first tranche (the Project) under the Investment Program will have four \ncomponents:  (i)  northern  basins  development  (NBD),  (ii)  NVDA  improvement,  (iii)  flood \nmanagement, and (iv) project management and program development. Each of these components \nwill have an integrated package of physical and nonphysical outputs. \n \na.  Component 1 \u2013 Northern Basins Development Physical Outputs \n \n41.  Large infrastructure. The Northern Basins19 is one of the five national RBAs defined \nunder the Water Law. The NBD activities build from previous ADB projects\u2014the Emergency \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EIRRP) 20 and the Balkh River Basin \nIntegrated Water Resources Management Project.21 Tranche 1 will finance infrastructure for water \nresources management and irrigation in the Lower Balkh River Basin (about 80,000\u2013100,000 ha of \nintensive irrigation). This includes construction of the Bangala weir, rehabilitation and upgrading for \nthe Samarkandian weir, and improved operational control for the Samarkandian and Narhi Shahi \nweirs. This improved infrastructure will nearly complete modernization of the former traditional \nintakes in the Lower Balkh Basin and provide significantly improved basin-level water management \nand distribution capacity, thereby enabling optimized water allocation and agricultural production. \n \n42.  Smaller irrigation infrastructure. The Project will provide rehabilitation and upgrading of \nabout 250 main canal structures, and nearly complete this work in the Lower Balkh Basin.22 \nSecondary and tertiary canal structures will be constructed and upgraded on a pilot basis in a WUA \ndevelopment program. Investment in these smaller structures will be scaled-up under the second \ntranche of the Investment Program once WUAs and robust implementation procedures have been \nestablished. \n \n43.  Improved canal access points for women. The Project will support development of \nimproved canal access points for women to do washing and collect water for household use. The \nProject's gender specialist will work through the WUAs and community development councils to \nengage women to identify the best design and locations for access points in the canal network.23 \nThis will be pilot tested in the first tranche to establish a robust implementation modality, and then \nscaled up in later tranches. The gender specialist will also develop options and a program to \nincrease investment in gender-related activities in subsequent tranches of the Investment Program. \n \nb.  Component 1 \u2013 Northern Basins Development Nonphysical Outputs \n \n44.  River basin management and operation and maintenance. The Project will support \ndevelopment of the Northern Basin RBA, including training and resources to monitor, measure, \nand analyze water flow and other data. Rules to manage and operate the modernized intakes and \n                                                 \n19 The Northern Basins include the Balkh Ab, Khulm, Sari Pul, and Samigan rivers. \n20 ADB. 2003.

(JFPR 9060-AFG). \n22 Under the EIRRP, a participatory process of working with the communities to identify and confirm the irrigation \nsystem improvements was established. This approach will be continued under the NBD component. As a part of \nthe process, the communities receiving assistance had to commit that they (i) would abstain from growing poppy, \nand (ii) provide requisite O&M to maintain the improvements. \n23 Community development councils were developed as a part of the National Solidarity Program implemented by the \nMinistry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development. They still serve as viable local government units in most \nvillages. \n ", "10 \nweirs on the Balkh River will be developed with water users to take full advantage of the improved \ninfrastructure.  Procedures  will  be  developed  and  RBA  staff  trained  for  effective  O&M  of  the \ninfrastructure under RBA management. The Project will support the RBA and Government in the \ndevelopment of mechanisms for sustainable O&M financing, including creation of policies and \nprocedures to assess and collect user fees to supply irrigation water; the work done in this regard \nfor the Northern Basins should also help in the development of related national policies. While \nthese procedures are being developed, tranche 1 will provide interim O&M funds for infrastructure \nunder the RBA. \n \n45.  The Project will support the RBA to prepare a Northern Basin water resources master \nplan to further develop the Northern Basins. The master plan will include feasibility studies, \ndetailed designs, and preparation of tender documents for the (i) Imam Sahib intake and main \ncanal structures; (ii) secondary and tertiary structures in the Lower Balkh Basin; and (iii) canal \noff-takes, irrigation structures, and flood management infrastructure throughout the Northern \nBasins, in preparation for financing in the second tranche of the Investment Program. \n \n46.  Water user associations and river basin councils. The component will mobilize and \nlegally establish WUAs in the Lower Balkh Basin based on the mirab system. A core technical \ntraining program for WUAs will be developed that includes (i) O&M and minor repairs, (ii) water \ndistribution management, (iii) basic irrigation design and improved structures, (iv) irrigation and \ncrop scheduling, and (v) monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Under the first tranche, a WUA \ndevelopment plan will be prepared for the adjacent basins to be executed in the second tranche \nof the Investment Program. The WUA training will also include (i) a pilot program for WUAs to \nparticipate in the rehabilitation and upgrading of secondary and tertiary structures, and (ii) \ndemonstration activities for improved on-farm water management. Under the Water Law, RBCs, \nwhich are made up of water users, are tasked with determining water allocations, permitting, \nsettling legal disputes, and helping to set policy for their associated RBA. Tranche 1 will help \nestablish the RBCs; during the second tranche, more intensive capacity development efforts will \nbe undertaken to improve the RBCs\u2019 effectiveness. \n \nc.  Component 2 \u2013 Nangahar Valley Development Authority Improvement \nProject Physical Outputs \n \n47.  System  rehabilitation.  This  component  comprises  comprehensive  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading of the irrigation system that includes repairs to the main canal headgate; desilting; \nimproved protection walls; new headgates on secondary canals; and works on siphons, spillways, \nand passages for drainage washes. All secondary and larger tertiary canals will be rehabilitated \nand fitted with new improved control structures. These works will be executed on and benefit both \nthe 12,000 ha of privately held land and the 8,000 ha of NVDA land.24 \n \n48.  Improved canal access points for women. The NVDA improvement component will also \nsupport work with the WUAs and community development councils to develop water access points \nwithin the canal network for women to wash and collect water for household use. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n24 Currently, most NVDA land is leased to small farmers for 1 year, and for a single wheat crop only; no second crop \nis permitted, although water supplies are adequate. This renders these areas far less productive than they could \nbe, and reduces livelihoods below than the private holdings. An important objective of the proposed NVDA \nbusiness plan is to identify options to improve the productivity of the leased land. ", " 11\nd.  Component 2 \u2013 Nangahar Valley Development Authority Improvement \nProject Nonphysical Outputs \n \n49.  NVDA reform. Institutional reform of NVDA under a corporatized management structure is \na key priority of MAIL. This component will support preparation of an institutional reform and \nbusiness plan with associated adjustment costs for the restructuring of NVDA on a corporate basis. \nAn important part of the institutional reform is creation of a sustainable irrigation service delivery \nagency to manage the main canal and an O&M financing mechanism for the irrigation system. The \nproject will provide interim O&M financing on a declining basis until the new system is put in place. \n \n50.  Water user associations. The Project will mobilize and legally establish WUAs on the \nprivately managed lands and on lands with leaseholders. A training program for WUAs and \nfarmers will be developed, similar to that under the NBD component. The NVDA WUAs training \nwill include demonstration activities for (i) improved irrigation and agricultural techniques for \ngreater productivity and efficiency, and (ii) on-farm water management. These activities will also \nbe made available to NVDA staff or other leaseholders farming the NVDA land. \n \ne.  Component 3 \u2013 Flood Management Physical Outputs \n \n51.  The Project will construct flood protection works for Yangi Qala town and the Yetim Tapa \nirrigation system in Takhar province along the south bank of the Amu Darya. This will include an \nearthen  embankment  5  kilometer  long  to  protect  the  town  and  irrigation  system  from  major \nflooding. The embankment may be elongated under the second tranche to expand the protected \narea, depending on its performance, and whether there are associated negative impacts. The \nworks will include a permanent gated intake for the Yetim Tapa irrigation canal intake on the Amu \nDarya River to protect 5,000 ha of irrigated area within the system. The Project will include funds \nfor gabions and other quick gestation, low-cost interventions to protect areas along the Amu Darya \nRiver from bank erosion. A limited number of these structures will be developed under tranche 1 \nand their performance will be reviewed for possible expansion during subsequent tranches.  \n \nf.  Component 3 \u2013 Flood Management Nonphysical Outputs \n \n52.  The flood management component will (i) help establish a National Flood Management \nProgram within MEW in Kabul, and (ii) prepare additional flood management works for financing \nunder the second tranche. The National Flood Management Program will develop a 5-year plan to \ninitiate the development and build the capacity of the new unit in MEW. Training will be offered to \nthe new MEW flood management unit on flood risk assessment, flood mapping, the design of \nvarious flood management structures, and other flood-related topics. This component will support \npreparation of two to four additional flood management structures along the Amu Darya River for \nfinancing under subsequent tranches. \n \ng.  Component 4 \u2013 Project Management and Program Development \n \n53.  Under the first tranche, project management arrangements will be put in place to ensure \neffective  implementation  and  timely  preparation  of  subsequent  tranches.  A  PMO  will  be \nestablished in Kabul under MEW to provide coordination and support for the NBD and the flood \nmanagement components. Two PIOs will be established\u2014in Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan\u2014to \ndirect field activities for these components. A PDF will be established within the Kabul PMO to \nmanage preparation of subsequent MFF tranches. A dedicated PMO will be established in \nJalalabad under MAIL for the NVDA improvement component, and will direct all implementation. \n \n ", "12 \nh.  The Second and Third Tranches \n \n54.  The NBD program will continue in tranche 2 with subsequent subprojects prepared \nduring tranche 1. Flood Management will be an ongoing program throughout all tranches with a \nprimary focus on the Amu Darya, possibly spreading to other regions in tranche 3. This will \ncontinue ADB's commitment to the north of Afghanistan. An important objective of the second \nand third tranches is to support development of new infrastructure projects for water resources \nand  irrigation.  The  projects  developed  will  in  part  depend  on  the  attractiveness  of  the \ninvestment(s), however, the Investment Program will target the Amu Darya, Kabul, and the \nNorthern River Basins to maintain the geographic focus of the first tranche investments. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n55.  Integrated  approach  to  sector  development.  The  Investment  Program  has  an \nintegrated approach to water resources sector development under a long-term program. It \nincludes substantial investment in infrastructure, including rehabilitation of existing assets and \ndevelopment of new infrastructure. The infrastructure supports enhanced water management \ncapacity at all levels\u2014including on-farm, tertiary and secondary irrigation canals, and large \nworks that promote improved water management on a basin level. The nonphysical investments \nsupport  improved  (i)  water  management  capacity  and  institutions  at  the  (a)  national  level \nthrough development of the Flood Management Program, and (b) at the basin level through \ndevelopment of the RBAs and RBCs; and (ii) water management at the irrigation system and \nfarm  level  through  development  and  strengthening  of  WUAs.  The  10-year  length  of  the \nInvestment Program provides an appropriate time frame to enable the physical and nonphysical \noutputs  to  impact  water  resources  management  and  development  in  a  synergistic  and \ntransformative manner. \n \n56.  Cofinancing  partnerships. The Investment Program thus sets out a framework for \neffective partnerships in assisting Afghanistan with developing its water sector over the medium-\nterm. Besides the Government of the United Kingdom (para. 66), other development partners \nmay determine to complement ADB's financing after the Board's approval of the proposed MFF \nthrough cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of cofinancing to be provided by \nall  development  partners  and  administered  by  ADB  (including  the  grant  provided  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom) under the Investment Program will be deducted from the \ntotal MFF amount approved by the Board. Such cofinancing may be provided as grants or \nloans, and may take the form of joint or parallel cofinancing. ADB's administration of such \ncofinancing from time to time will be reported to the Board for information annually.25 \n \n57.  Multitranche financing facility modality. Use of the MFF to extend ADB financing to \nthe Investment Program is proposed for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The MFF approach provides flexibility to ADB and the Government. ADB and the \nGovernment can modify the amount and timing of ADB contributions under each \ntranche, assuming the proposed financing ceiling of $303.3 million equivalent is \nnot exceeded. Such flexibility is important if the Government can raise financing \nfrom other sources, or if the Government needs more time to finalize specific \nproject packages. In addition, the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely \nlinked to the availability of resources within ADB, and to full compliance with \nwarranties and representations made under the framework financing agreement \n(FFA). \n                                                 \n25 ADB, 2008, Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility, Manila.(para. 79)  ", " 13\n(ii)  Financing under the MFF can be aligned to specific technical, safeguard, legal, \nand other project selection criteria. The authorities can make grant conversions \nunder the MFF as and when projects are ready for execution. This approach \nfacilitates advance actions and the expedient establishment of administrative and \nimplementation arrangements. The MFF allows ADB and the Government to \nmore closely link financing to possible changes in project costs bundled under \neach tranche, which avoids cost overruns. \n \n(iii)  A program loan would help improve policies but not capital investments, which \nare crucially needed. By channeling funding through an MFF, ADB, and the \nGovernment can shift time and resources away from repetitive processing tasks \ninto implementation work. \n \n(iv)  All required conditions for the use of an MFF are in place: a strategy and road \nmap, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan. The modality \nalso moves the analytical work up front, leaving resources and multiple entry \npoints for ADB and the Government to focus on execution, capacity, and reforms. \nADB and its partners have agreed on decision-making criteria for the provision of \nfinancing,  including  specific  warranties  and  representations,  and  covenants \nleading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n \n58.  The status of the MFF preconditions is as follows: \n \n(i)  Strategy. The strategic framework and road map are sound. The main components \nare provided with desired sector outcomes. \n \n(ii)  Policy framework. The policy framework is well developed, but capacity needs to \nbe developed and institutions strengthened to ensure its effective implementation. \n \n(iii)  Investment Program. Under the ANDS, the Government prepared a medium-term \ninvestment  plan  for  the  water  sector.  The  current  investment  plan  for  water \nresources  and irrigation calls for investments of $2,468 million.  \n \n(iv)  Financing plan. The Government's investment plan has a significant gap between \nfinancing  and  sector  needs.  ADB  is  one  of  the  financiers,  together  with  the \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Government of \nIndia, United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank \namong others. If financing for the shortfall is not secured, the Investment Program \nwill still continue but at a slower pace. The national budget is not a reliable financing \noption. \n \n59.  Weakly performing country status. ADB's approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries  (WPCs)  recognizes  that  WPCs  face  various  development  challenges  in  different \ndegrees, and that existing ADB business processes sometimes constrain effective operations in \nWPCs. 26 Afghanistan is considered a WPC because of its conflict status. While the Government is \ncommitted  to  implementing  the  Investment  Program,  there  are  certain  constraints  facing \nAfghanistan, including (i) the need to deliver development projects expediently in multiple and risk \nprone areas that may yield varying economic and financial returns; (ii) difficulty in timely recruitment \nof quality consultants, contractors, and procurement of goods; (iii) limited availability and qualified \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries (The Asian Development Bank's \nApproach to Engaging with Weakly Performing Countries). Manila. \n ", "14 \ncounterpart staff for project preparation, implementation, and management.  \n \n60.  To strengthen the effectiveness of ADB's operations in WPCs, ADB's current approach \nallows that some of existing ADB business processes could be relaxed (footnote 26). Accordingly, \nthe following are areas in which selective relaxation of ADB's requirements can be considered \nunder the proposed MFF: \n \n(i)  Rates  of  return  on  program  or  project  feasibility  assessments. Given the \nconflict  status  of  Afghanistan,  it  should  be  recognized  that  the  financial  and \neconomic risks of investment projects under the Investment Program are higher \nand that lower returns are possible. \n \n(ii)  Involvement of counterparts. Given the limited availability of qualified counterpart \nstaff in Afghanistan as well as security concern, ADB can consider alternative \narrangements, including requesting the Government to outsource the counterpart \nrequirement. \n \n(iii)  Eligibility and modes of procurement. ADB may consider relaxing its eligibility \nrules and modes for the procurement of works and goods, as well as engagement \nof consultants in situations where coordination with other development partners is \nrequired,  or  ADB  considers  necessary  and  appropriate  to  ease  project \nimplementation. \n \n61.  While  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program  has  been  prepared  and  will  be \ndelivered  using  standard  ADB  business  processes,  future  tranches  under  the  Investment \nProgram could benefit from expedited project processing and approval, as well as relaxation of \nthe ADB business processes requirements in the areas mentioned in para. 60. The exact \nbusiness processes and associated specific guidelines to be relaxed and expedited, and their \napplication to a specific project will be detailed in the related PFR report for a particular tranche. \nRelevant internal approval and consultation will be sought as appropriate in accordance with the \nthen-prevailing ADB policies, rules, and procedures. \n \nD.  Water Resources Investment Program \n \n62.  The ANDS proposed a sector investment plan for $3,761 million for the entire water sector. \nFor irrigation and water resources management, MEW has defined a revised investment plan of \n$2,468  million  over  the  medium-term  under  the  ANDS  national  programs  that  include:  (i) \nInstitutional  Set-Up  and  Capacity  Building  Program,  (ii)  Water  Resource  Infrastructure \nManagement  Program  (includes  both  the  National  River  Basin  Management  and  Irrigation \nRehabilitation programs), (iii) Bank Protection and Flood Control Program, and (iv) National \nWater  Resources  Development  Program  (Table  1).27 The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to \nfinance a portion of this investment plan and to support it over 10 years through an MFF. The \namount proposed is up to $303.3 million equivalent. A set of initial investments has been \nprepared  under  the  ADB  Investment  Program.  The  investments  will  be  financed  in  three \ntranches, with the first totaling $92.8 million. Table 2 provides estimates for the first tranche \ncomponents (see Appendix 5 for detailed cost estimates). Table 3 provides the estimates for \nADB's Investment Program over the three tranches based on the Government's investment \nprograms under the ANDS. \n                                                 \n27 The Government's investment plan provides ambitious targets for the medium-term and in particular for the \nNational Water Resources Development Program. However, over the long-term, substantially more resources will \nbe required to develop the sector. The Government investment plan will be updated with support from the PDF as \nadditional and more reliable project information becomes available.

Financing Plan and Conditions \n \n63.  The Government has asked ADB to provide up to the equivalent of $303.3 million to help \nfinance the Investment Program. Tranche 1 will involve cofinancing of $3.3 million equivalent from \nthe Government of the United Kingdom. ADB financing will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources in accordance with relevant ADB policies,28 subject to modification that may be \nincluded under individual financing agreements. The implementation period will be 10 years. \nThe Investment Program will consist of individual tranches, the term of which may vary. The \nMFF will finance civil works, equipment and goods, consulting services, and recurrent costs. \n \n64.  The Government will submit a PFR for each tranche, which will be reviewed by ADB in \naccordance with the FFA and ADB's then-prevailing policies. If approved, financing will be \nprovided from the MFF. The Government has submitted the first PFR, requesting $89.9 million to \nhelp finance the tranche 1 project. The terms and conditions for subsequent tranches will be \nsubject to (i) the availability of ADB's Special Funds resources; (ii) Afghanistan\u2019s access to such \nresources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy 29  and  Asian  Development  Fund  donor \nrequirements; and (iii) the availability of ADB Special Funds resources to Afghanistan pursuant to \nthen-applicable policies concerning allocation of, and eligibility for, such funds.

The Board approved the policy paper on the revised framework for Asian Development \nFunds grants on 26 September 2007.31 This policy provides that for countries eligible for grant \nassistance, the percentage of financing on a grant basis in a country will be based on its debt-\ndistress classification. Afghanistan is classified as a country with a high risk of debt distress, and \nis eligible to receive 100% grant financing in tranche 1. \n \n3.  Financing Subsequent Tranches \n \n68.  Financing  may  be  made  available  from  ADB,  provided  the  Investment  Program \ncontinues to be implemented in accordance with the general understandings and expectations \non which the MFF is based, as contained in the FFA. Progress towards achieving the expected \noutcome and outputs set out in the DMF for the Investment Program will be guided by the \nproject selection criteria (Appendix 6). Furthermore, compliance with the policy framework, \nsafeguard requirements, social development policies, and all other undertakings contained in \nthe FFA will also influence ADB\u2019s decision whether to continue financing individual tranches. \n \n69.  If a decision has to be made during the early stages of implementation of tranche 1, \nwhen  results  would  most  likely  not  yet  have  been  achieved,  ADB\u2019s  decision  to  process \nadditional financing tranches would be made based on the Government\u2019s level of commitment \nregarding and efforts to achieve the outcome set forth in the DMF. Nonphysical tasks agreed \nupon that have a direct effect on the outputs expected from the Investment Program (e.g., \nassumptions  and  mitigation  of  risks  in  the  DMF  pertaining  to  the  Government,  such  as \ncounterpart staff, commitments to institutional change, and O&M issues) will be primary factors \nin ADB decisions. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program and Project Management \n \n70.  Executing agency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be executing agency (EA) for the \nInvestment  Program.  MEW  will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  for  the  NBD  and  flood \nmanagement components, and manage the PDF. MAIL will be the IA for the NVDA component. \n \n71.  Project management offices. PMOs will be established within both MEW and MAIL \nwithin 3 months of grant effectiveness. The MEW PMO will be located in Kabul and oversee \nmanagement of the Investment Program, including monitoring and evaluating the progress of \nthe overall investment program, and consolidating accounting and reporting on NBD and flood \nmanagement components. The MAIL PMO will be located in Jalalabad and be responsible only \nfor the implementation of the NVDA component in the first tranche and will report to MOF and \nADB.32 Both PMOs (under MEW and MAIL) will be headed by full-time program directors that \nwill be appointed by their respective agencies within 3 months of grant effectiveness. The PMOs \nwill be supported by teams of full-time specialists with technical and engineering, legal, finance \nand administration, safeguards and gender, M&E and reporting, and capacity and institutional \ndevelopment expertise, along with administrative staff. The teams will include counterpart staff \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Funds Grants. Manila. \n32 MAIL will also maintain a small project liaison office in Kabul to facilitate communication and coordination between \nMAIL and NVDA and between MAIL and MOF. This will be staffed by one liaison officer and one financial \nmanagement officer (both appointed within 3 months of grant effectiveness). \n ", "18 \nas  well  as  international  and  national  consultants  to  provide  support  and  ensure  effective \nimplementation (see Appendix 7 for organizational charts). \n \n72.  Program development facility. Within 3 months of grant effectiveness, and concurrent \nwith establishment of its PMO, MEW will establish a PDF. Prior to and in preparation for the \nformal establishment of the PDF, MEW will first appoint a full-time project director for the PDF \nwithin 2 months of grant effectiveness, and then appoint consultants and counterpart staff to \nsupport the project director when the PDF is established. The PDF will be responsible for the \nidentification,  screening,  feasibility  preparation,  and  detailed  design  of  the  subsequent \ninvestment packages under the Investment Program.33 The MEW PMO will establish a PIO at \nMazar-i-Sharif to implement the NBD component, and a PIO at Taloqan to implement the flood \nmanagement  component,  both  within  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness.34 Each  PIO  will  be \nheaded  by  a  full-time  project  director  (appointed  within  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness), \nsupported by implementation consultants and counterpart staff (appointed within 4 months of \ngrant effectiveness). All program and project directors and counterpart staff will serve on a full-\ntime basis and be competitively selected and remunerated, free and clear of any restrictions \napplicable to Afghanistan\u2019s public servants, and acceptable to ADB. \n \n73.  The two PMOs and associated PIOs will be responsible for management, execution, and \ncoordination of all activities under tranche 1. Their responsibilities include (i) recruitment of \nconsultants; (ii) supervision of the implementation consultants; (iii) collection of baseline data \nand M&E of all activities; (iv) safeguards; (v) coordinating with MEW, MAIL, and concerned \nRBAs,  RBCs,  and  WUAs  to  ensure  progress  is  on  schedule  with  respect  to  institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building; and (vi) financial management. \n \n74.  A program steering committee (PSC) will be formed to oversee the Investment Program \nand tranche 1 activities. This will be the same committee that was formed in June 2007 to \noversee all other ADB-supported water sector activities in Afghanistan. The PSC is chaired by \nthe MEW minister; members include representatives from MOF, MEW, MAIL, the Ministry of \nMines, and the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development. The MEW and MAIL PMOs \nwill serve as the PSC secretariat. The PSC will meet as required for program guidance, but a \nminimum of every 6 months to provide policy guidance and review tranche 1 and Investment \nProgram performance. \n \n75.  Project coordination office. MOF will establish a project coordination office (PCO) to \nfacilitate coordination among MOF, MEW, and MAIL and to support the PSC as required. The PCO \nwill support the two PMOs and subsequent investment program implementation with regard to (i) \nprogress reporting, (ii) M&E, and (iii) facilitating financial processing requirements within MOF on \nbehalf of PMOs. MOF will appoint a PCO coordination officer and an M&E officer within 4 months \nof grant effectiveness. If consultant support is required, this will be recruited on an individual basis.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n33 Two options will be used to screen and prepare new projects. In the case of small- to medium-scale potential \nprojects located in the NBD and flood management areas, the PIOs have been tasked to identify and prepare \nadditional projects, including detailed designs. For all other (or for large-scale) investments, the PDF will contract \nthe services of consulting firms or individuals using procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n34 For the PIO in Mazar-i-Sharif, the existing PIO from the former ADB EIRRP will be retained to carry on the work if \npossible. If this eventuates, appointment of a new PIO will not be necessary. The flood management PIO will be \nlocated in Taloqan where communications infrastructure and commercial banking facilities are available, with a \nbase established in Yangi Qala to manage construction. ", " 19\n2.  Specific Project Implementation Processes by Component \n \n76.  Rehabilitation and upgrading of the main, secondary, and tertiary canals of the NVDA \nirrigation system and the associated works will be the responsibility of the MAIL PMO, assisted \nby the consulting services for detailed design and construction supervision. The MEW PMO and \nPIOs (Taloqan and Mazar-i-Sharif) will be responsible for the (i) construction of the (a) flood \nembankment and associated irrigation intake at Yangi Qala, (b) Bangala weir, (c) 250 main \ncanal structures in the Lower Balkh River Basin, and (d) improved canal access points; and (ii) \nrehabilitation and upgrading of the secondary and tertiary canals They will be assisted by \nconsulting services covering both detailed design and construction supervision. For the civil \nworks outlined above (except for those implemented using community participation), the design \nand supervision consultants will be assigned the role of the engineer and will provide (i) design \nservices,  (ii)  contract  document  preparation,  (iii)  support  with  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (iv) \nconstruction supervision. Payment to civil works contractors will be approved by the relevant \nPMO and/or PIO based on certification by the \u201cengineer\u201d.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n77.  The Investment Program is scheduled for execution over a 10-year period commencing \nin 2009 and ending in 2019. Management approval of tranches 2 and 3 is targeted for 2013 and \n2015, respectively.35 All physical works and institutional support financed under the MFF will be \ncompleted by 22 March 2019 at the latest, and the final date for any disbursement under the \nMFF is 22 September 2019. \n \n78.  The  NBD  and  the  flood  management  activities  under  the  initial  tranche  will  be \nimplemented over a 5-year period commencing in early 2010. Formation and training of WUAs, \ndesign of various works, and the construction of Bangala weir are all scheduled to commence in \nthe first year. The NVDA irrigation system rehabilitation component will be implemented over a \n4-year period also commencing in early 2010. Formation and training of WUAs, survey work, \nand detailed design work are necessary prior to award of civil works, and construction will \ncommence midway in the second year and be completed during the fourth year. The physical \nimplementation of tranche 1 will be completed by 31 December 2014. Indicative implementation \nschedules for tranche 1 and the Investment Program are in Appendix 8. \n \n79.  Project readiness. Preliminary designs or feasibility-level drawings have been prepared \nfor all tranche 1 works to be awarded by ICB. The 204 structures prepared by the EIRRP have \nexisting designs and tender documents under preparation.36 A design exists for the Bangala \nweir, but it needs to be updated. Individual consultants for hydrology, hydraulic engineering, and \nprocurement will be hired to advance preparation of the detailed design, tender documents, and \nprocurement for the Bangala weir and rehabilitation and upgrading of the Samarkandian weir. \nThe ICB tendering for these activities will be underway prior to the arrival of the MEW PMO and \nPIO implementation consultants, who will evaluate the bids and supervise the construction. For \nall  other  tranche  1  projects,  due  diligence  has  been  performed  to  assess  their  technical, \neconomic, and financial viability. The concurrence of the Government and IAs were obtained for \nall tranche 1 projects. All tranche 1 projects requiring physical investment have been classified \nas category B in terms of resettlement and environmental impact, and category C for indigenous \npeoples. An initial environmental examination (IEE), environmental assessment and review \nframework  (EARF),  and  cumulative  impact  assessment  have  been  prepared.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) and short land acquisition and resettlement plan \n                                                 \n35 The PDF has adequate resources to prepare both tranche 2 and tranche 3 investments for subsequent PFRs. \n36 The designs and tender document will be reviewed and confirmed by the implementation consultants. \n ", "20 \n(SLARP) for NBD have been prepared. A number of potential projects have been identified for \npreparation in tranche 2. Final due diligence on all subsequent projects will be conducted under \ntranche 1, and tranches 2 and 3 will be fully prepared during the tranche 1. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n80.  Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the Investment Program will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated to cost more than $500,000 and for civil \nworks that cost more than $2 million. NCB will be used for goods and works above $100,000 and \nbelow the aforementioned ICB thresholds.37 Shopping will be used for goods and works equal to or \nbelow $100,000. With respect to construction activities under tranche 1, civil works packages for (i) \nBangala weir and rehabilitation and upgrading of Samarkandian and Narhi Shahi weirs, (ii) the \nYangi Qala flood embankment and associated irrigation headworks, (iii) the majority of the main \ncanal structures in the Lower Balkh Basin, and (iv) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the NVDA \nirrigation system will be awarded under ICB procedures. Civil works contracts costing less than $2 \nmillion\u2014including  pilot  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  rehabilitation  in  the  Lower  Balkh  Basin, \ndevelopment of improved canal access points for women, and emergency floodworks along the \nAmu Darya\u2014will be awarded using NCB procedures or shopping.38 These smaller works will not \nbe suitable for or of interest to international contractors and adequate national contracting capacity \nexists to complete these works.39 Before commencement of any procurement activity under NCB, \nADB and PMO will review the Government\u2019s recently enacted public procurement provisions to \nensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n81.  The pilot secondary and tertiary canal rehabilitation in the Lower Balkh Basin and the \nimproved  canal  access  points  for  women  may  be  undertaken  using  community  participation \nprocedures with WUAs, providing the cost of the works is $10,000 or less for the initial contract and \nup to $30,000 if the WUA has relevant experience. Selection criteria for these works have been \ndeveloped that ensure (i) they involve no safeguard issues, (ii) the community is capable of and \ncommitted to ongoing O&M, and (iii) the scope of work is within their capacity to manage. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 9 and the procurement plan with all annexes including community \ncontracting and national competitive bidding details is in Supplementary Appendix G. In addition, \nprocurement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  future  tranches  of  the  MFF  indicating  the  particular \ncontracts for goods, works and consulting services required, proposed methods of procurement, \nand related ADB procedures. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n82.  Advance contracting and retroactive financing are proposed for procurement of goods \nand services for projects financed through the Investment Program. The Government was \ninformed that expenditures incurred before tranche effectiveness will be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing only if procurement, consultant recruitment procedures, and other expenses fully comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. When the tranche \nbecomes effective, up to a maximum of 20% of the proceeds may be used to retroactively finance \neligible expenditures incurred during the 12-month period prior to signing of the relevant financing \nagreement. The Government may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing. In that \n                                                 \n37 Any necessary modifications or clarification to NCB procedures will be set forth in the procurement plan. \n38 In order to accelerate contract awards, a limited number of the main canal structures in the lower Balkh Basin may \nbe contracted using NCB procedures if the designs and tender documents are prepared. \n39 All civil works contracts awarded under international competitive bidding, the first five national competitive bidding \ncontracts, and the first seven community contracting contracts will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval procedures. ", " 21\ncase, the procurement procedures completed under advance contracting are concluded and the \naward of contract made after the tranche becomes effective. The Government and the EAs have \nbeen informed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance any of the proposed projects. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n83.  Robust levels of consulting support will be required to ensure implementation of the \nworks under tranche 1 due to (i) the limited project management capacity available in MEW and \nMAIL, and (ii) the expanding workloads in both ministries. Support will also be required to \nprepare investments under ensuing tranches of the Investment Program. The PMOs and PIOs \nwill be supported by consulting services to provide detailed design and construction supervision \nfor tranche 1 works. Additionally, the PDF and PIOs in Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan will be \nprovided necessary consultant support to (i) identify, establish the feasibility of, and prepare \ndetailed designs for projects in ensuing tranches of the Investment Program; (ii) prepare a \nmaster plan for water resources development in the Northern Basins; and (iii) establish a \nNational Flood Management Program within MEW in Kabul. Consultant support will be provided \nto establish and train effective WUAs. Consultant support for the PMOs will be contracted in two \nseparate packages; one for MEW and one for MAIL. The MAIL package will provide 72 person-\nmonths of international and 302 person-months of national consultant services, while the MEW \npackage will provide 219 person-months of international and 795 person-months of national \nconsultant  input.  Eight  person-months  of  international  and  8  person-months  of  national \nindividual consultant input will be recruited to accelerate project readiness for construction of the \nBangala weir and for rehabilitation and upgrading of the Samarkandian weir. Details regarding \nand the schedule of inputs for consultant services is Appendix 10. Detailed terms of reference \nfor consulting services will be provided in Supplementary Appendix E. All consultants to be \nfinanced under the Investment Program, including those under tranche 1, will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The selection and engagement of the two main packages outlined above will be through \nfirms selected on quality-based selection (QBS) procedures.40 The same applies for firms to be \nrecruited by the PMO to carry out preparation of subsequent tranches under the PDF. The two \nPMOs  may  select  individual  consultants  for  inputs  as  the  situation  requires.41 The  PMO \nimplementation consultants will recruit the services of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for \n(i) WUA training and on-farm water management demonstration activities, (ii) assistance as \nneeded with the updating and implementation of the SLARP, and (iii) external monitoring of \nresettlement activities. The NGOs will be contracted on a competitive basis acceptable to \nADB.42 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n40 The QBS method is to be used to attract interest from qualified firms, which tend to avoid cost competition in a \nvolatile environment such as Afghanistan. ADB has had numerous experiences in Afghanistan with substandard \nconsultants being recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method resulting in work of substandard \nquality, implementation delays, and cost overruns. Effective project preparation and implementation in Afghanistan \nis difficult and demands consultants of the highest quality. The two primary implementation consulting contracts \nwill be recruited using full technical proposals. The use of full versus simplified technical proposals for subsequent \nrecruitment of firms will depend upon the size of the contract, complexity of the work to be undertaken and other \nrelevant concerns in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n41 Recruitment of individual consultant input requires a no-objection from ADB. \n42 Funds for the recruitment of NGOs will be included as provisional sums in the contracts for the implementation \nconsultants for the MEW and MAIL PMOs.  \n ", "22 \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n84.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, the EA, and the IAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe Investment Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOF, MEW, and MAIL, as well as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Investment Program. If corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive  practices  are  found,  ADB  will  automatically  cancel  the  MFF  and  the  tranches \nconcerned. This position has been made clear to the Government. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n85.  Two  first-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  in  commercial  banks \nacceptable to ADB. One account will be established in Kabul for the use of the MEW PMO, and \none in Jalalabad for the use of the MAIL PMO. Two second-generation imprest accounts will be \nestablished by MEW for use by its PIOs and will be located in Mazar-i-Sharif for the NBD \ncomponent and Taloqan for the flood management component. All imprest accounts will be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government of Afghanistan and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the \ntwo first-generation imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures under \nthe grant, or 10% of the total grant amount, whichever is less. The initial amount to be deposited \nin the two second-generation imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of the projected \nexpenditure of the PIOs of MEW to be funded from such accounts, or $500,000, which ever is \nless.43 The currency for all accounts will be US dollars. Statements of expenditure procedures \nwill  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest \naccounts for individual payments under $100,000. Grant disbursements for goods and services \nunder  major  civil  works  and  consultant\u2019s contracts  will  be  made  using  the  direct  payment \nprocedure, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n86.  Subsequent PFRs will be mutually exclusive, in that the funds under each PFR will be \ngoverned by a separate grant agreement. The respective grant agreements will describe the \ndetailed disbursement arrangements for a specific PFR. Grant disbursements under subsequent \ntranches of the MFF will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n87.  The MEW and MAIL PMOs will prepare and maintain separate accounts for project- and \nprogram-related expenditures adequate to identify goods and services financed from grant \nproceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred  for  the  project,  and  use  of \ncounterpart funds for project- or program-related expenditures. The two PMOs will consolidate \nand review accounts, and after auditing submit them to MEW or MAIL, and to MOF and ADB. \nProject accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB using \ninternational accounting standards. The audited accounts and audit reports will be submitted to \n                                                 \n43 Bank charges associated with the imprest accounts will be financed by ADB. ", " 23\nMOF and ADB no later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate. The \naudit reports will include statements verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against statements \nof expenditure have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. The imprest \naccounts and statements of expenditures will be audited as a part of the regular audit of project \naccounts, and should have separate opinions. Financial management assessments for MAIL, \nMEW, MOF, and NVDA were carried out and found that while adequate systems were in place, \ncapacity and execution need strengthening. The PMOs and PIOs include financial management \nconsulting support to (i) ensure sound financial management procedures are established and \nexecuted  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)  develop the  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  (please see \nAppendix 11 for the Flow of Investment Program Funds). \n \n88.  Both  PMOs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  quarterly  financial,  physical,  and \ninstitutional and capacity development progress reports on their respective program activities,44 \nand  submitting  these  to  MOF,  MEW,  MAIL,  and  ADB.  The  PCO  (MOF)  will  support  and \ncoordinate this task with the PMOs. The quarterly reports are to be submitted within 1 month \nfollowing the end of the quarter to which they relate.45 \n \n89.  Within 3 months of completion of the Project, the PMOs will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report relating to the components for which each was responsible.46 In addition to \nquantifying physical progress and monitoring the utilization of grant funds, all reports will include \na progress statement regarding the status and effectiveness of the recently established RBCs \nand RBAs, and the WUAs established and/or strengthened under tranche 1.47 \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n90.  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, a project performance management system \n(PPMS) for tranche 1 activities will be established in each PMO; in the case of the MEW PMO it \nwill have direct links to the PIOs and PDF.48 The M&E program will be prepared in consultation \nwith MOF, MEW, and MAIL as well as concerned RBCs, RBAs, and WUAs. Participatory M&E \ntechniques will be introduced to support the PPMS as a part of the WUA and RBA activities \nunder tranche 1, and appropriate capacity will be developed. A database of key benchmark \nindicators (among those currently highlighted in the DMF) will be established by the respective \nPMOs and become a part of the PPMS. The key indicators selected will be monitored at least \ntwice per year. \n \n11.  Project Review  \n \n91.  During the initial 2 years of tranche 1 implementation, ADB will conduct review missions \nat least twice annually to (i) assess the effectiveness of the implementation arrangements and \npropose  needed  adjustments;  (ii)  monitor  implementation  progress  relative  to  the  agreed \nimplementation schedule, identify constraints to progress, and define an action plan to improve \nimplementation; (iii) ensure that ADB safeguards and other conditions set out in the grant \nagreement and financial framework agreement are complied with; and (iv) assess preparatory \n                                                 \n44 Reports prepared by the MEW PMO will incorporate reports from the PIOs (Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan) and the \nPDF relating to the progress of forward planning and implementation of the overall Investment Program. \n45 In addition, the PMOs will prepare other such information and reports relating to both tranche 1 activities and the \nInvestment Program in total as ADB may reasonably request. \n46 It is envisaged that the MAIL PMO\u2019s completion report will be prepared in the fourth year of the implementation \nperiod for tranche 1 activities, and the MEW PMO\u2019s report in the fifth year.  \n47 The MAIL PMO\u2019s completion report should also provide full detail regarding the status of restructuring of NVDA and \nthe effectiveness of the newly established entities to manage and provide O&M for the main canal. \n48 This will be revised and updated upon arrival of the implementation consultants. \n ", "24 \nwork for subsequent investment packages to avoid delays in submission of subsequent PFRs. \nADB will field a comprehensive midterm review mission for the tranche 1 investment package 2 \nyears following grant effectiveness, which will assess performance, identify problems affecting \nproject implementation, and reach formal agreement with the Government of Afghanistan on \nany changes in the scope of work or to implementation arrangements required to address the \nidentified shortfalls. The full terms of reference of the mid-term review mission will be developed \njointly by MOF, MEW, MAIL, and ADB during the second year of implementation. Prior to \nfielding the mission, MEW and MAIL will each submit detailed progress reports relative to their \nrespective components. Project review arrangements for subsequent tranches of the Investment \nProgram will be similar to those for tranche 1 activities. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Benefits \n \n92.  Economic benefits. For the NBD and NVDA components, the principal benefits will be \nincreased  agricultural  production.  More  dependable  water  supply  and  improved  water \nmanagement made possible by infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading and development of \nWUAs and RBAs will support expanded irrigated areas, increased cropping intensities, and \nimproved crop yields. For the NBD component, the Project will directly benefit about 84,000 ha \nin the lower Balkh River Basin irrigation systems, and in particular the 39,200 ha within canals \ncontrolled by the Bangala weir. About 20,000 ha will benefit from the NVDA improvement \ncomponent. \n \n93.  Impacts will depend on the location of a farm within the irrigation system. The tail areas \nare  expected  to  benefit  relatively  more  than  the  head  and  middle  reaches,  because  the \nimproved water supply availability and reliability will be relatively greater in the tails. For the \nNBD component, an increase of 12.5% in cropped area is expected in the tail reaches and 5% \nto 9% in the head and middle reaches of the Aqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals below the \nBangala weir. Yield increases are expected to average 7% in the tail reaches of these canals \nbut  only  3%  in  the  head  and  5%  in  the  middle  reaches.  The  impacts  arising  from  the \nrehabilitation and upgrading of main canal structures will range from 2% to 5% for increases in \ncropped area, with yield increases of 1% to 2%. These benefits will be realized throughout the \nirrigation system. \n \n94.  For private farms in the NVDA areas, increases in cultivated area will vary from only 4% \nin canal head reaches to 10% at the tail end of canals, while average crop yields are expected \nto increase by between 2% and 5%. The overall increase in cropped area will be 7.3%. In the \nstate farm areas, the cropping intensity, which is relatively low, is expected to increase by \naround 25%, with a greater diversity of crops than at present, and crop yields will increase by an \naverage of 10%. These changes will be facilitated by improved incentives for farmers that lease \nland on the state farms. \n \n95.  The flood management component will provide protection from floods and erosion for \nabout 5,000 ha of cultivated land along the south bank of the Amu Darya River at Yangi Qala, \nas well as for the town of Yangi Qala. The embankment along the river and the head regulator \nat  Yetim  Tapa  will  prevent  flood  damage  to  crops,  livestock,  villages  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure. In the areas along the Amu Darya River, the Project will protect households from \nlosses, but will not have a direct impact on the household incomes. \n \n ", " 25\n96.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be (i) 16.9% for NBD, (ii) \n18.4% for NVDA improvement, and (iii) 20.4% for flood management. The overall project EIRR \nis 18.0%. These results are robust to changes in key variables. For the Project, the switching \nvalue for a decrease in benefits is -23% and for an increase in investment costs is +32%. \n \nB.  Household and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n97.  The Project will have a positive impact on household incomes, food security and poverty \nreduction in project areas. The overall demand for farm labor will increase due to the expanded \nirrigated area and increases in cropping intensity. This is expected to amount to about 600,000 \nlabor days per year (5.9 days per ha) for NBD and NVDA combined. The financial impact of the \nproject on farm households will vary by location. For households in the tail reaches of canals \nbelow  the  Bangala  weir,  where  the  Project  will  have  the  greatest  impact,  the  increase  in \nhousehold income for a 1 ha farm will be $93 per year, or 27% of present estimated income. In \nthe head reaches of these canals (where current water supplies are more assured and current \nincomes higher), the expected increase is $172 per year, or 8.2% of present income. The \nimpact of the rehabilitation and upgrading of main canal structures on household incomes is \nexpected to vary from 2.3% ($49) in the head reaches to 6.2% ($21) in the tail reaches. In the \nNVDA subproject area, where current incomes are higher than in the Northern Basins because \nof the greater production of fruit and vegetables, increases in farm household incomes for a 1 \nha farm will be between $406 per year (an increase of 8.6%) in the head reaches and $461 per \nyear (an increase of 21%) in the tail reaches. Many households have small holdings of less than \n1 ha, and when these are located on head and middle reaches, the project will enable some \n(and possibly many) households to move above the poverty line. While the impact on poverty in \nthe tail reaches may be less in absolute terms, it will be larger in relative terms. \n \n98.  Program  benefits.  The  economic  and  financial  benefits  of  interventions  under \nsubsequent tranches of the Investment Program should be similar in scope and magnitude to \nthose identified under the first tranche. Benefits from development of new infrastructure will \nhave the added impact of expanding the production base and providing irrigation to farmers who \nhave never enjoyed this opportunity. An important benefit from the Investment Program is that \nmore reliable irrigation, especially for second-season cropping, will encourage production of \ndiversified and higher-value crops that provide alternatives to poppy production. Other benefits \nthat are not quantified stem from institutional strengthening and capacity development for RBAs, \nRBCs, and WUAs, which will result in greater water use efficiency and higher productivity. The \nimproved  water  management  and  possible  development  of  water  storage  through  the \nInvestment Program will help support climate change adaptation. \n \nC.  Social Safeguards \n \n99.  Involuntary resettlement. A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was \nprepared  based  on  the  laws  of  Afghanistan  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual49 and endorsed by the Government. The \nLARF has established a process for (i) resettlement categorization of project activities as A, B, \nor  C  based  on  ADB  guidelines;  (ii)  assessment  of  required  resettlement  activities;  (iii) \npreparation  of  any  required  resettlement  plans  or  other  safeguards  documents;  (iv) \ncompensation to affected persons prior to commence of civil works; and (v)  grievance redress \namong other resettlement activities. The safeguards teams in the PMOs will be responsible for \nall resettlement activities and prepare any required resettlement plan(s). The categorization \n                                                 \n49 ADB. 2008. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2/BP. Manila. \n ", "26 \nform and draft resettlement documents for subsequent tranches will be submitted for ADB \napproval with each PFR. The PMO and implementation consultants and/or contractors will \nupdate resettlement plans during detailed design. Resettlement plans will be implemented only \nafter they have been formally approved by the IA and cleared by ADB. No notice to proceed will \nbe given for civil works until the resettlement plan is fully implemented in the construction area. \nThe PMO will monitor the resettlement plan implementation and report to ADB. In addition, an \nexternal monitoring agency will be engaged by the PMO and will have responsibility for (i) \nconfirming that any required land acquisition and resettlement activities have been completed \nprior to commencement of civil works, (ii) assessing implementation, (iii) progress reporting, and \n(iv)  assessing  the  impact  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  external \nmonitoring agency findings and quarterly reports will be filed independently with the EA, IA(s), \nand  ADB,  and  relevant  information  may  be  included  in  PMO  reporting.  A  nongovernment \norganization  may  be  engaged  as  required  to  support  the  PMO  with  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  activities.  The  LARF  will  ensure  that  women  receive  due \ncompensation for losses, and that women who are de facto household heads are clearly listed \nas  beneficiaries  for  compensation.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  agreed  to  pay \nresettlement compensation costs. \n \n100.  Tranche 1 has been categorized as category B for resettlement. The NBD component \nwill require some land acquisition that may impact up to five families, but no relocation is \nrequired. The flood management component requires compensation for 19 families that are \ncurrently farming in the area of the proposed protective embankment. Short land acquisition and \nresettlement plans (SLARPs) have been prepared for the affected persons. A summary of the \nLARF is found in Appendix 14 and the full LARF and SLARP are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n101.  Indigenous peoples. The tranche 1 project has been classified as category C. The \ntranche 1 project areas are inhabited by different ethnic groups. The socioeconomic features \nand level of vulnerability of these people do not fit with the characteristics defined by ADB's \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The impact of subsequent tranche projects on indigenous \npeoples will be categorized through the initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) screening \nand  indigenous  peoples  categorization  followed  by  appropriate  actions  as  indicated  in  the \napproved LARF. Specific actions favorable to indigenous peoples will be included in the land \nacquisition and resettlement plan or in the specific PFR document for projects categorized as B \nin terms of indigenous peoples impact. Projects undertaken as part of future tranches will avoid \nnegative impacts on indigenous peoples. If a project under a future tranche is classified as \ncategory A with respect to indigenous peoples impacts, an indigenous peoples development \nplan will be prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Any required \ndocuments relating to indigenous peoples will be attached to the PFR.  \n \n102.  Gender. The project's gender analysis indicated that the first tranche interventions will \nnot create significant adverse or beneficial gender impacts that differ from the status quo. The \nanalysis also indicated that the Investment Program would have limited entry points for gender-\nrelated activities, because the role of women in water resources management and irrigation is \nnot  significant.  Other  concerns  that  do  affect  women\u2014such  as  the  creation  of  income \ngeneration activities (poultry, animal husbandry, carpet making, handicrafts, etc.)\u2014are not part \nof this project, and no impacts related to these issues are anticipated. However, in an effort to \naddress  gender-related  concerns  associated  with  the  Investment  Program,  the  project  will \nimprove access sites at irrigation canals where women traditionally gather to wash clothes and \ncollect water. Under the project, the gender specialist will work with the WUAs and community \ndevelopment councils to solicit views from women on the design and location of the access \npoints. This intervention will be scaled up in subsequent tranches that also have irrigation-", " 27\nrelated activities. The gender specialist for the NBD component will prepare options to introduce \nadditional gender interventions for tranches 2 and 3. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n103.  An EARF and cumulative impact assessment were prepared for the Investment Program \nfollowing  the  Government\u2019s  existing  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy (2002). The EARF lays out the procedures and provides guidance for \nenvironmental  due  diligence  under  the  Investment  Program.  Environmental  capacity \ndevelopment  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  supported  through  the  implementation \nconsultants\u2019 environmental specialist, who will be part of the safeguard team in the PMOs. The \nPMOs, with support from the consultants, will be responsible for environmental monitoring and \nimplementation of the environmental management plans (EMPs). For future tranches, initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs), or environmental impact assessments, if required, will be \nprepared following the EARF and included in the appraisal report, with due public consultation \nand information disclosure. The finalized IEEs will be submitted with the PFR for ADB approval. \n \n104.  The IEE, including an EMP and summary IEE, was prepared for the first tranche, which \nis classified as category B in terms of environmental impacts. The Project should have positive \nimpacts on the environment including improved water-use efficiency, protection of assets from \nriver bank erosion and flooding, and better land-use management. Potential negative impacts \ninclude  (i)  erosion  of  flood  protection  infrastructure;  (ii)  dust,  noise,  and  waste  during \nconstruction;  (iii)  flood  flow  displacement  due  to  headworks  operation;  and  (iv)  possible \ndegraded surface and groundwater quality and public health due to increased use of agricultural \ninputs. These will be mitigated by (i) development of a contractors\u2019 environmental management \nplan based on the EMP, with monitoring benchmarks; (ii) operation of infrastructure to minimize \nflood  damage;  (iii)  WUA  training  for  improved  water  management;  and  (iv)  RBA  capacity \nbuilding  related  specifically  to  developing  and  implementing  technically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  sound  operational  policies  and  procedures.  All  of  the  environmental  due \ndiligence documents for the first tranche and Investment Program are found in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n \n105.  Security. Security has been declining in Afghanistan over the last 3 years and this could \ndelay or in some cases prevent successful implementation of interventions under the program. \nHowever, experience operating in Afghanistan has provided lessons to mitigate security risks. \nProject  implementation  will  be  supported  by  adequate  security  resources,  including  for \ncommunications,  transport  and  physical  reinforcement  of  facilities.  Security  plans  will  be \ndeveloped for each activity with support from the Afghanistan Resident Mission security team; \nprivate and government security personnel will be engaged as required. \n \n106.  Capacity. MEW and MAIL both require technical, project management and financial \nmanagement capacity development. Previous experience has shown that counterpart capacity \nis generally inadequate to support project implementation, meaning adequate consultant input is \nrequired to ensure effective and timely project implementation. Formal and on-the-job capacity \ndevelopment activities will take place in parallel with project implementation and counterpart \nstaff will assume more responsibility as capacity is developed. The long-term partnership under \nthe MFF modality helps support this approach. \n \n \n ", "28 \n107.  Operations  and  maintenance  sustainability.  The  sustainability  of  improved \ninfrastructure  and  associated  project  benefits  will  depend  on  adequate  O&M  capacity  and \nfinancing. To mitigate the risk of inadequate O&M, the project includes (i) O&M training and \nplanning for MEW and MAIL staff; (ii) interim project O&M funds, with the assurance that the \nGovernment will allocate adequate recurrent budget resources for O&M; and (iii) WUA training \nin O&M and development of approaches to ensure their financial sustainability. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n108.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to the following \nassurances, which have been largely incorporated into the FFA presented to the Board and will \nbe  incorporated,  as  appropriate,  into  the  legal  documents  for  projects  financed  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n109.  Policy  dialogue.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  about  its  policies  and \nprojects related to the water resources sector that are expected to materially affect the financial \nviability of each project under the Investment Program, and in particular issues that will affect \nthe implementation, management and O&M of existing assets and planned sector development.  \n \n110.  Nangahar Valley Development Authority restructuring. Prior to the commencement \nof civil works for the rehabilitation of the main canal of NVDA, MAIL will have endorsed a plan \nfor the corporatization of NVDA that includes a business plan for operation of core activities. \nThe  plan  will  also  define  a  structure  that  supports  an  irrigation  service  agency  for  the \nsustainable O&M of the main canal, and secondary and tertiary areas of command still under \nNVDA-managed irrigation, with requisite funding to support recurrent costs. \n \n111.  Project selection criteria and implementation arrangements. MEW will ensure that all \nprojects to be financed under the MFF meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the agreed selection \ncriteria and that all projects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB. The agreed \nselection criteria are presented in Appendix 6. \n \n112.  Program and project directors and related offices, facilities and counterpart staff. \nWithin 3 months of grant effectiveness, (i) MEW and MAIL will appoint program and project \ndirectors acceptable to ADB; (ii) MEW will establish a PMO in Kabul and MAIL a PMO in \nJalalabad, together with all requisite counterpart staff; and (iii) MEW will establish the PDF with \nall requisite counterpart staff. MEW will also establish PIOs in Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan within \n3 months of grant effectiveness and with all requisite counterpart staff within 4 months of grant \neffectiveness. The Government will ensure that counterpart staff for the PMOs and PIOs are \nsupplied according to the agreed implementation arrangements and serve on a full-time basis. \nThe Government will ensure that staff for all positions on projects financed under the MFF are \ncompetitively  selected  and  remunerated,  free  and  clear  of  any  restrictions  applicable  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s public servants. \n \n113.  Counterpart staff. MEW and MAIL will ensure that counterpart staff will be provided as \nrequired  (within  reasonable  levels  identified  during  preparation  of  the  Project)  to  support \neffective and timely implementation of all activities under the Project.  \n \n114.  Investment program facilities. MEW and MAIL will ensure that office space with utilities \nand other resources will be provided as required (within reasonable levels identified during \npreparation of the Project) to support effective and timely implementation of all activities under \nthe Project. This includes office space for implementation consultants and support staff. \n ", " 29\n115.  Operation  and  maintenance.  MEW  and  MAIL  commit  to  ensuring  the  O&M  of \ninfrastructure built under the Investment Program. To ensure RBAs have the resources to \nundertake O&M activities, the Government will commit to providing O&M budgets to RBAs for a \nspecified timeframe. In the longer term, the Government commits to developing policies and \nprocedures for the collection of fees for water service delivery as provided for under the Water \nLaw to support O&M of irrigation and water resources infrastructure. For structures maintained \nby  WUAs  (normally  secondary  and  tertiary  canal  structures),  the  Government  will  ensure \nadequate ongoing support to the WUAs to sustainably manage the O&M. \n \n116.  Auditing and accounting. MEW and MAIL will ensure that separate project accounts and \nrecords are maintained in a timely manner to adequately identify the use of tranche proceeds in a \nmanner (and in accordance with details) that may be specified in each financing agreement for \nrelevant tranches. Audited financial reports of MFF-financed activities will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n117.  Financial governance. MEW and MAIL will ensure that their respective internal controls \nare in accordance with the National Accounting Standards. \n \n118.  Environment.  MEW  and  MAIL  shall  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is  designed  and \nimplemented,  and  the  Project  facilities  constructed  and  operated,  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Recipient and ADB's Environment Policy (2002); (ii) the \ndesign and implementation of the Project strictly follows the mitigation measures set forth in the \nIEE for the Project, including the EMP and the EARF; (iii) mitigation measures identified in the \nEMP, if any, are incorporated in bidding documents and related contracts under the Project; (iv) \nbidding documents include a reference to the EMP to ensure that environmental issues are \ncovered comprehensively; and (v) an environmental performance report is submitted to ADB on \na semiannual basis during the project implementation period in the format and containing such \ndetails as required by ADB. If there is any discrepancy between the Recipient\u2019s relevant laws \nand regulations, and the requirements of ADB's Environment Policy, ADB's policy shall apply. \n \n119.  Land acquisition and resettlement. MEW and MAIL shall ensure that (i) the Project \nis designed and implemented in accordance with the Recipient's relevant laws and regulations, \nthe requirements of ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the LARF as agreed \nwith  ADB;  (ii)  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  for  project  implementation  are  made \navailable in a timely manner; (iii) where land acquisition and resettlement are necessary, the \nrelated works will commence and contractors will be mobilized only after the related land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (as approved by ADB) has been disclosed to the affected \npeople and  properly carried out; and  (iv) the activities  of  all  relevant contractors are  in \ncompliance with the requirements of the related land acquisition and resettlement plan. If \nthere  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  Recipient's  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  ADB's  policy  shall  apply.  The \nRecipient shall engage an external agency or a nongovernment organization acceptable to ADB \nto conduct the external monitoring of the resettlement process and the evaluation of relevant \nimpacts, with reports from the independent monitoring agency to be submitted to ADB on a \nsemiannual basis. \n \n120.  Indigenous  peoples.  MEW  and  MAIL  shall  ensure  that  the  Project  and  its \nimplementation do not negatively affect indigenous peoples in the territory of the Recipient. In \nthe event that any such indigenous people are negatively affected or otherwise involved in any \nof the project activities, the Recipient shall take all necessary actions that are required by, or will \notherwise comply with, ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n ", "30 \n121.  Execution of civil works contracts. MEW and MAIL will ensure that, subsequent to \naward of civil works contract under any project, no section or part thereof under the civil works \ncontract will be handed over to the contractor unless compliance can be demonstrated with (i) \napplicable provisions of the land acquisition and resettlement framework and plans, including the \ntimely delivery of compensation to affected people; (ii) indigenous peoples development framework \nand indigenous peoples development plans; and (iii) the EARF and EMPs. Any changes to the \nlocation,  route,  alignment,  or  environment  impacts  resulting  from  changes  introduced  during \ndetailed design of related projects will be subject to prior approval by ADB and MEW or MAIL, in \naccordance with the project selection criteria and procedures specified in the FFA. MEW and MAIL \nwill  ensure  that  the  infrastructure  rehabilitated  or  newly  developed  under  the  Investment \nProgram will comply with technical specifications of the design. \n \n122.  Gender.  MEW  and  MAIL  will  follow  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998) during the implementation of each project, including taking all necessary \nactions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in planning and implementing \nproject activities. The EA and IAs will monitor the Project\u2019s effects on women through, where \nrelevant, gender-disaggregated data collected pursuant to the M&E system referred to in the \nPPMS. \n \n123.  Labor and health standards. The Government shall ensure that all contractors under \nthe Investment Program: (i) comply with applicable labor laws of Afghanistan; and (ii) use their \nbest efforts to employ women and local people negatively affected by, or living in the vicinity of, \nthe  project area.  Afghanistan  shall also ensure  that:  (i) each  civil works  contract  contains \nprovisions prohibiting (a) the use of child labor and (b) differentiation in wages between male \nand  female  workers  for  work  of  equal  value;  (ii)  such  contract  also  includes  mandatory \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions;  and  (iii)  the  relevant \ncontractors and their workers observe local protocols concerning acceptable behavior toward \nthe local population. Afghanistan shall further ensure that each implementing agency, with the \nassistance  of  relevant  local  authorities,  causes  the  contractors  under  the  relevant  project, \nsubproject, or component to distribute to their workers information on the risks of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. \n \n124.  Security. Afghanistan shall (i) provide overall security and protection in the relevant \nareas where projects, subprojects, and components will be implemented to ensure the smooth \nand uninterrupted implementation of the Investment Program; (ii) be responsible for the removal \nof mines and unexploded ordnance in such areas; and (iii) cause and ensure that each of the \ncontractors under the projects, subprojects, or components prepares, and includes as part of \nthe contract, a security plan together the required budget that will ensure the smooth and \nuninterrupted implementation of the relevant activities contemplated under the contract. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n125.

Road Map \n \n1.  Background \n \n1.  Sound management and development of water resources are vital for Afghanistan's \nsustained economic growth, particularly in the agricultural sector. Agriculture employs about two \nthirds of the population and comprises up to half of Afghanistan\u2019s gross domestic product, \nhowever,  the  contribution  varies  considerably  with  yearly  climatic  conditions.  Irrigation  is \nnecessary in most areas for reliable agriculture, and irrigated agriculture accounts for about \n80% of all agricultural production. About 85% of Afghanistan\u2019s population lives in rural areas \nand are either directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Development of \nthe agricultural sector, which requires improved access to irrigation, is essential for economic \ngrowth, enhanced livelihoods, and poverty reduction. \n \n2.  However, irrigation and water resources infrastructure and the capacity and institutions \nto manage and develop it have been severely degraded over the last 30 years. By the mid-\n1970s, an area of almost 3 million hectares (ha) received some form of irrigation. Today, only \nabout 1.8 million ha receives irrigation due to the deterioration of irrigation systems from (i) civil \nunrest and war, (ii) floods and droughts, (iii) breakdown of institutions responsible for managing \nthe systems and their operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iv) a lack of resources for O&M \nand periodic rehabilitation. \n \n2.  Sector Vision \n \n3.  Afghanistan National Development Strategy. The Government of Afghanistan (the \nGovernment)  is  addressing  this  situation  through  the  Afghanistan  National  Development \nStrategy (ANDS - approved in April 2009), which provides the framework and specific sector \nstrategies  for  the  development  of  Afghanistan.50 The  ANDS  established  three  pillars  for \nsustained growth: (i) security, (ii) governance, rule of law and human rights, and (iii) economic \nsocial development. Development of water resources is given the highest priority under the \nANDS and its vision for the sector is \"to manage and develop the country's water resources so \nas to reduce poverty, increase sustainable economic and social development, improve the \nquality of life for all Afghans and ensure and adequate supply of water for future generations.\" \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Water  Resources  Development  Investment \nProgram (the Investment Program) will increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture due to \nimproved water resources management through infrastructure development, capacity building, \nand  institutional  strengthening.  The  Investment  Program's  outputs  will  include  (i)  physical \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  irrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure;  (ii)  the \ndevelopment of new infrastructure for irrigation, flood management, and water resources; (iii) \nsupport to develop and implement improved institutional frameworks and policies for irrigation, \nflood management, and water resources management; (iv) programs to strengthen line agencies, \nO&M, and management practices; and (v) capacity development programs to ensure sustainable \noutcomes. \n \n5.  The approach to the Investment Program is to develop projects that integrate physical \nand  nonphysical  elements  to  address  sector  needs  comprehensively  and  holistically,  and \n                                                 \n50 Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul (page 46). ", "Appendix 3          43 \nachieve desired outcomes. This approach, combined with long-term ADB engagement through \nthe  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  modality,  will  provide  the  necessary  support  to \nsustainably  improve  the  performance  and  accelerate  development  of  water  resources  in \nAfghanistan. \n \n3.  Sector Challenges \n \na.  Physical Challenges \n \n6.  Water Resources Availability. On an average per capita basis, Afghanistan receives \nadequate precipitation, so that it should not be a water-scarce country. However, surface water \nrunoff is highly seasonal and very unevenly distributed. Over half of Afghanistan's water runoff \n(much of it flood) flows into the Amu Darya River, which is expensive to develop, and it is far from \npopulation and economic growth centers. Harnessing water resources when and where they occur \nfor productive use is a key challenge to develop the sector.  \n \n7.  Degraded  Infrastructure.  Existing  water  resources  and  irrigation  infrastructure  in \nAfghanistan has received inadequate O&M over the last 30 years and is extremely degraded. \nSignificant investment in rehabilitation and upgrade is required to restore existing infrastructure to \nits full productive potential. \n \n8.  Lack of New Infrastructure. While Afghanistan has water resources that it can harness for \nproductive purposes, it has not invested in new water resources and irrigation infrastructure over \nthe last several decades. Substantial investment is needed to help Afghanistan bridge the gap from \nyears of stagnated economic development. \n \n9.  Floods and Bank Erosion. One impact of the unevenly distributed perception and runoff is \npervasive annual flooding and bank erosion, which cause damage to irrigation systems and leads \nto the permanent loss of agricultural land, livestock, and rural infrastructure. In years of high \nflows, the impacts are particularly acute with substantial damage and losses. The Ministry of \nEnergy and Water (MEW), which has primary responsibility for water resources, is currently \nworking to develop a flood management policy, yet need assistance and capacity development \nto complete this as well as to put together a long-term plan and investment program for flood \nmanagement throughout all Afghanistan. \n \n10.  Transboundary Considerations. Over 95% of Afghanistan's water resources are in rivers \nthat flow into neighboring countries. This makes development of water resources more challenging \nsince coordination and agreements with riparian neighbors may be needed for their development. \n \n11.  Inefficient Water Resources Management. Since most of the irrigation in Afghanistan \n(about 80%) is from traditional systems that are not engineered and constructed from rudimentary \nmaterials, irrigation efficiency is low. The problem is exacerbated by their degradation over the last \ndecades. The lack of investment in new infrastructure has also hampered water use efficiency. Not \nonly are there technical constraints, but irrigation and water management practices need to be \nimproved at the system as well as the on-farm level. The sector would benefit significantly from \ntraining and the introduction of more efficient irrigation technologies and management practices. \nTremendous  scope  exists  to  increase  water  use  efficiency  at  all  levels  to  ensure  the  most \nproductive use of all water resources. \n \n \n \n \n ", "44          Appendix 3 \n \nb.  Nonphysical Challenges \n \n12.  Lack  of  Water  Resources  Knowledge  Base.  Effective  water  management, \nrehabilitation and upgrading, and development of water resources and irrigation infrastructure \nrequire quality data. A severe lack of surface and groundwater data, meteorological data, and \nagricultural  data  among  others  exists  constraining  effective  planning  and  management. \nMonitoring capability is limited both from a lack of technical resources and human capacity to \nmanage  data  collection  and  analysis.  A  concerted  effort  is  needed  to  ensure  that  that \nmeasurement and monitoring systems and the institutions and capacity to use them effectively \nare put in place to support sector development. \n \n13.  Capacity and Weak Institutions. Capacity is still weak across many aspects of project \npreparation and management for water resources and irrigation in Afghanistan. The MEW has a \nsolid policy framework under the new Water Law and various sector strategies, however, it requires \nsubstantial assistance to carry out its mandate and execute the sector strategies. After having \nsupported implementation of previous donor projects as well as receiving technical assistance \nfor capacity development, MEW's staff capacity to develop and manage water resources is \nimproving  with  regard  to  basic  engineering  and  project  management  although  external \nassistance is still needed. However, strengthening MEW and its staff to carry out the new \nchallenges of creating and effectively managing River Basin Agencies (RBAs) as called for under \nthe new National Water Law will require a new approach and skills that do not exist in MEW. \n \n14.  Feasibility Studies and Investment Plan. Substantial work is being undertaken for \nrehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation systems throughout Afghanistan, but little investment is \ntaking  place  to  develop  new  infrastructure.  Although  potential  projects  exist,  part  of  the \ninvestment constraint is a lack of quality feasibility studies. MEW has contracted preparation of \nfeasibility studies to regional firms, however, many of the completed studies need additional \nwork on technical options, economics, safeguards, and other issues to bring them to a standard \nthat would support ADB investments. \n \n15.  MEW has a list of priority investments, yet it is not fully supported by objective selection \ncriteria or complete data and project information. However, even with good feasibility studies, \nanalysis is required to prioritize and sequence projects, especially in a river basin context, \nwhere upstream developments can impact downstream projects. Additional work is required and \nis ongoing to (i) develop better feasibility studies to support investment, and (ii) prioritize and \nsequence investments as the basis of a comprehensive sector investment plan. \n \n16.  Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of Infrastructure. The Government has limited \nfunds  and  capacity  for  O&M  of  large  water  resources  infrastructure.  Donor  funds  and \nGovernment general revenues can be used in the short term for recurrent costs however, a \nlonger term solution is required. Under the new Water Law, fees can be collected for water \ndelivery costs, and the Government is committed to developing tariff strategies for O&M funds to \nreduce subsidies and achieve O&M sustainability. Developing and implementing these policies \nwill become more critical as new infrastructure is developed in the coming years. Since over \n80% of irrigated area is from traditional systems, communities have been responsible for O&M \nfor hundreds of years. Yet, the strength of the traditional management has declined in recent \nyears. Support is required to build upon the traditional community management structures and \nto establish water user associations (WUAs) under the Water Law. While O&M still remains a \nchallenge, opportunities and strategies are in place to address it on multiple levels. \n \n17.  Poppy Cultivation. Afghanistan currently produces over 90% of the world's opium and \npoppy production and poses a huge social, political, and security challenge. Opportunities for ", "Appendix 3          45 \nalternative livelihoods are required in rural areas to ease the reliance on the opium economy. \nImproved access to irrigation, especially for higher value second season cropping, provides \nenhanced incomes that blunt the strong economic incentives to grow poppy. At the same time, \nassurances are required from communities receiving assistance that they will abstain from \npoppy production. \n \n4.  Road Map \n \n18.  The road map is based on the ANDS strategy, which includes desired sector outcomes \nand physical and nonphysical targets, as well as ADB sector analysis to guide the Investment \nProgram.  Table  A3.1  highlights  the  critical  milestones  for  sector  development  along  with \ntimelines. The ANDS strategy and the road map below includes long-term milestones and \nalthough many of the activities may be planned to take place well into the future, this is likely the \nmost realistic scenario for Afghanistan. \n \nTable A3.1: Road Map with Milestones for Water Resources and Irrigation \n \nObjective  Milestone  Timeline  Responsibility \u2013 \nImplementation Support \nImproved Water Resources Management \nImproved  institutional  Approval of new National Water  2009\u2013  MEW  \nframework  for  irrigation  Law  completed \nand water resources  \n  Rules  and  regulations  for  the  2012  MEW with technical assistance \nNational Water Law drafted  support  from  development \npartners.  \n  Environmental  regulatory  2012  MEW, National Environmental \nframeworks  and  management  Protection Agency \nservices  for  water  quality  and \nwater resources management \n  Policy  for  flood  management  2015  MEW with ADB support \ndrafted and approved \n  Climate change policy for water  2015  MEW with technical assistance \nresources drafted  support  from  development \npartners. \nEffective RBAs and RBCs  Northern  Basins,  Amu  Darya,  2014  MEW with support from ADB \nand  Sub-basin  Agencies  and Western Basins RBAs and  and European Commission \nand Sub-basin Councils  RBCs  established  and  all  sub-\nbasins delineated \n  Staff  recruited  and  trained  for  2014  MEW with support from ADB \nNorthern,  Amu  Darya,  and  and European Commission  \nWestern Basins RBAs and RBC \n  Revitalize  the  Helmand  2013  MEW with support from ADB \nArghandab  Valley  Association  and  other  development \nwith the intent for it to become  partners \nthe Southern Basins RBA \n  RBAs  and  RBCs  for  all  of  2016  MEW with support from ADB, \nAfghanistan established.

Strategic Context \n \n19.  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy.  As  noted,  the  ANDS  provides  the \noverall development framework and specific sector strategies for irrigation and water resources \nin Afghanistan. To flesh out the sector strategy, road map and investment plan the ANDS is \nsupported by a national Water Sector Strategy that addresses all subsectors including water \nsupply,  environment,  and  hydropower  among  others.51 The  ANDS  and  supporting  strategy \nhighlights the importance to water resources with regard to economic development, and notes \nthat  both  the  Government  and  donors  have  under-invested  in  better  water  resources \nmanagement with negative consequences for the productive lives of the people.  \n \n20.  The ANDS and supporting sector strategy include a set of investment programs for \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  institutional  and  capacity  strengthening  to  develop  the  sector.  In \naddition to the investments, the ANDS has a Water Sector Strategic Action Plan that outlines \npolicy,  institutional,  and  capacity  development  activities  needed  to  achieve  desired  sector \noutcomes, which are reflected in the road map above. The ANDS programmatic approach plus \nthe existing legal and policy framework including the new Water Law (see para. 22), provide the \nstrategic framework to support sector investment. The ANDS programs and their objectives and \ninitial  investment  program  provide  a  well-defined  road  map  to  guide  sector  investment. \nRefinements are required and are ongoing, and the ADB Investment Program will be updated \nas better information becomes available and new projects are prepared. \n \n21.  ADB Strategy. ADB's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Afghanistan (2009\u2013\n2013) is fully aligned with the ANDS. The CPS highlights four sectors for ADB investments: (i) \nenergy, (ii) transportation and communication, (iii) agriculture and natural resources (including \nirrigation and water resources), and (iv) governance. The new strategy for the water sector \nrepresents  a  continuation  of  the  previous  objectives  from  the  CPS  Update  (2005\u20132008). \n                                                 \n51 The ANDS strategy is based on the first national water strategy that was drafted and adopted in 2004. The Water \nLaw specifically tasks MEW with formulation and implementation of a national water strategy. It also requires the \nRBAs to develop basin strategies and development plans, which can form the basis of a consolidated national plan. \nStrategic planning for water sector development has already received substantial attention and the process is now \ninstitutionalized under the Water Law. The main issue is to develop capacity and secure resources to implement \nand improve the strategic work.  ", "Appendix 3          49 \nHowever, investments and institutions are supported in a more programmatic fashion through \nthe combination of physical and nonphysical investments under the MFF modality. The new \nstrategy attaches special importance to themes, particularly gender and development, capacity, \nand private sector development. In addition to the CPS, the Investment Program is fully aligned \nwith Strategy 2020\u2013the Long Term Strategic Framework, which includes investment in water \nresources infrastructure as a core ADB business activity. The Government's commitment to a \npolicy  framework  based  on  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  principles \ncontained in the Water Law and ANDS are consistent with the ADB Water Policy, Water for All. \n \nC.  Policy and Institutional Framework \n \n22.  National Water Law. The policy framework for water resources is well structured to \naddress the challenges of the water sector in Afghanistan, however, developing the capacity \nand strengthening the institutions to implement the framework will require significant resources \nand a long-term commitment. The corner stone of the policy framework is the new Water Law \n(signed by the President on 30 April 2009) that is based on Integrated Water Resources \nManagement principles. The Water Law establishes the overarching sector framework and \nministerial responsibilities, not only for irrigation and water resources management, but all other \nsubsectors including water supply and sanitation, hydropower, and the environment, among \nothers. \n \n23.  Ministry of Energy and Water. MEW is the lead agency for water resources whose \nresponsibility includes (i) making policies to guide and strategies planning, development and \nprotection of water resources; and (ii) regulating use of water resources. Under the new Water \nLaw, RBAs have been established under MEW to replace the previous provincial field structure. \nRBCs made up of line agencies, local government, and water users have been established \nunder the Water Law to provide policy guidance and oversee permitting and disputes resolution \nfor their associated RBA. The Water Law supports water end-user participation in decision \nmaking for (i) water resources planning, implementation, and management; (ii) operations and \nmaintenance; and (iii) determination of water allocations. Although five RBAs have been created \nacross the country, they are not yet functional, and lacking staff and resources adequate to \ncarry out their mandate. The work to establish the RBCs is also in its nascent stages. Under the \nfive main RBAs and RBCs that cover the country, sub-basin agencies and councils are to be \nestablished as required for more localized management. \n \n24.  Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock. MEW is the lead ministry for water \nresources  and  irrigation,  however,  MAIL  has  responsibility  for  on-farm  water  management \n(OFWM) as well as development of smaller irrigation concerns, although in practice MAIL is \ncurrently not implementing any irrigation projects.52 MAIL has very limited capacity for irrigation \nbut has its own irrigation sector strategy with the emphasis on small water harvesting and \nOFWM interventions, the latter of which is vital to help achieve the maximum productivity from \nirrigation system rehabilitation and upgrading. Donors are working with MAIL to develop this \ncapacity, and MAIL will play an increasingly important and effective role for irrigated agriculture. \n \nD.  Investment Program \n \n25.  To  achieve  sector  objectives,  the  ANDS  structured  10  programs  with  associated \ninvestments for the water sector, 5 of which address irrigation and water resources. The initial \ninvestment plans for each of the programs were developed for the medium term, however, \n                                                 \n52 NVDA is an exception to MAIL's normal operations.   \n ", "50          Appendix 3 \n \nthese will evolve as more projects and sector needs are identified. The ANDS programs and \ntheir objectives are well structured to achieve sector goals, and these should remain in place to \nsupport sector development. The Program Development Facility to be established under the first \ntranche  of  the  Investment  Program  will  work  with  MEW,  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders to refine and update the Government's sector investment plan and ANDS programs. \nThe relevant ANDS programs for water resources and irrigation are listed below. \n \n(i)  The  Institutional  Set-up  and  Capacity  Building  Program  supports  capacity \ndevelopment for water resources management institutions at all levels from WUAs to \nRBAs, and MEW at the national level. In addition to technical competence, financial \ncapacity for infrastructure and recurrent costs as well as the development of financial \nmanagement capacity are also stressed. This program will support the development \nand implementation of sector laws, policies, and rules and regulations. \n(ii)  The  National  Water  Resources  Development  Program  is  the  largest  program \nfinancially and focuses on development of new infrastructure. It addresses both the \nneed for improved planning and project development capacity as well as resources \nfor new infrastructure development. The estimated cost of this program is over $2 \nbillion dollars, which in medium term is likely unrealistic, however, in the longer term \nis far short of what will be required to develop infrastructure for the sector.  \n(iii)  The National River Basin Management Program targets implementation of the new \ninstitutional structure for water management under the Water Law and capacity to \nmanage water based on IWRM principles. Development of capacity for stakeholder \nparticipation for water management is stressed. \n(iv)  The  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Program  supports  rehabilitation  of  mainly  traditional \nsystems,  which  are  the  majority  in  Afghanistan.  This  includes  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading of existing infrastructure along with improved O&M and management. \n(v)  The Riverbank Protection Program addresses bank erosion and flood control. It \nlooks at shorter- (including emergency) and longer-term structural and nonstructural \nmanagement options and development of a national program. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n26.  The ADB Investment Program and first tranche investments are fully aligned with and \nsupport the objectives and national programs outlined under the ANDS investment plan (para. \n25). The ANDS proposed a comprehensive water sector investment program for $3,761 million for \nthe entire water sector. MEW has revised this to $2,468 million over the medium term based on the \nANDS national programs for irrigation and water resources management. Table A3.2 provides the \ncurrent medium term investment plan based on the ANDS programs. \n \nTable A3.2: Medium-Term Water Sector Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem  Medium Term \nInstitutional Set-up and Capacity Building Program  46.0 \nWater  Resource  Infrastructure  Management \nProgram  (includes  National  River  Basin \nManagement and Irrigation Rehabilitation)  133.0 \nBank Protection and Flood Control Program  161.0 \nNational Water Resources Development Program  2,128.0 \nTotal  2,468.0 \nSource: Ministry of Energy and Water and Asian Development Bank estimates. ", "Appendix 3          51 \n \n27.  Currently, the resources available to support this investment plan are just over $800 million \nor a third of the needs identified by MEW. It is anticipated that the sector investment plan and \nfinancing will increase as additional projects and needs are identified with better information and \nimproved capacity for planning. As noted, the MEW investment plan has optimistic targets, yet will \nbe updated. While the investment plan may be refined, the objectives of the ANDS Water Sector \nStrategy and the ANDS programmatic approach develop the sector along with the legal and policy \nframework including the new water law and provide a sound strategic framework to support the \nsector investment.

Introduction \n \n1.  Selection criteria are required to identify projects and subprojects to be financed under \nthe Water Resources Development Investment Program (the Investment Program). Selected \nprojects  agreed  to  by  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) utilizing the approval process detailed below will be prepared to a \nstandard acceptable to ADB by the Program Development Facility (PDF) under the Ministry of \nEnergy and Water (MEW) during the first 5 years of the Investment Program. The selection \ncriteria include: (i) general criteria for all interventions pursued under the Investment Program, \n(ii) specific criteria for interventions involving flood management and river bank erosion, and (iii) \nspecific criteria for interventions involving irrigation (Table A6).  \n \nB.  Selection and Approval Procedures \n \n2.  The  appraisal  process  has  already  been  undertaken  for  the  first  tranche  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) under the Investment Program. Investments for interventions to be \nproposed for inclusion in subsequent PFRs will be processed in accordance with the following \nprocedures. \n \n3.  The PDF, acting on behalf of MEW, will undertake a preliminary assessment\u2014including \npreliminary site visits as required\u2014of the proposed interventions to ensure compliance with the \nInvestment  Program's  selection  criteria.  During  this  preliminary  assessment,  the  PDF  will \nprepare an initial poverty and social assessment and complete the requisite ADB safeguard \nchecklists  to  determine  the  initial  project  categorization  with  respect  to  the  environment, \nindigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement. \n \n4.  Based  on  the  preliminary  assessment,  the  PDF  will  recommend  those  investment \npackages deemed suitable for a full feasibility study. The PDF's recommendations will be \nreviewed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MEW, and ADB, and their concurrence to proceed \nwill be obtained before the PDF contracts the feasibility study and/or detailed design to prepare \nthe investment. If a proposed intervention is not likely to satisfy the selection criteria and/or the \nagreed approval procedures, ADB will inform MOF and MEW, who will advise the PDF to either \n(i) modify the intervention proposal in such a way that it will be eligible, or (ii) reject the proposed \nintervention. In the latter case, the PDF may propose a replacement subproject that will be \nsubjected to same selection process. Feasibility-level assessment and/or detailed design of \napproved investment packages will be contracted to a consulting firm or individual(s) by the \nPDF, with the results reported to the program steering committee (PSC). \n \n5.  Based on the feasibility studies and/or detailed design for the interventions that are \ntechnically  feasible,  economically  viable,  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable,  and  in \ncompliance with the selection criteria, the PDF will prepare draft appraisal reports and requisite \nADB safeguard due diligence documents along with recommendations that the proposal be  \nincluded in the next PFR prepared for ADB consideration. Projects that are recommended will \nbe subject to the approval of the PSC. Upon obtaining the PSC\u2019s concurrence with the PDF\u2019s \nrecommendations concerning subprojects to be included under the Investment Program, MOF \nwill submit the PFR to ADB for approval. MOF will ensure that the necessary internal approvals \nhave been obtained prior to submission of the PFR. ADB will then review the PFR for approval \nin accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n ", "Appendix 6         59 \n \nTable A6: Investment Program Selection Criteria \n \nGeneral Selection Criteria \nThe intervention should be consistent with accepted integrated water resources management planning principles and \nthe Investment Program's road map that supports the Government's water resources sector investment plan. \nThe economic return on the investment packages considered should be at least 12%.  \nThe intervention should not have a negative impact\u2014in terms of water quality or quantity\u2014on other water users who \nhave a recognized entitlement and are reliant on water supplied by the same water system (basin). \nEach subsequent investment under the proposed MFF must address all ADB safeguards, including environment, \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples as detailed in the Financing Framework Agreement. MEW and PDF staff must \nensure that this criterion can be met or that cost-effective mitigation measures will satisfy requirements during the \npreliminary assessment of potential projects approved for further feasibility study. \nThe intervention should not present unacceptable technical risks in terms of its development or operation that would \nundermine its efficacy, economic return, or safety. \nPotential investments must have provisions and assurances and/or commitments for adequate O&M of the completed \nworks. This could be in the form of temporary, declining levels of funding from ADB or other development funds \ncomplemented by increasing levels of government support, water-user funding, and/or in kind contributions adequate \nto meet all recurrent expenditures and/or O&M. \nThe intervention should be of a size and scale such that the beneficiaries are capable of independently operating and \nmaintaining the systems when construction activities are complete, unless there is a government entity charged with \nmanagement and O&M of a project or subproject that cannot be managed by the community. The intended \nbeneficiaries must have indicated enthusiasm for the intervention and a willingness to operate and manage it in a \ncohesive  fashion  as  demonstrated  through  willingness  to  contribute  cash  or  in-kind  labor  to  the  subproject \ndevelopment and through willingness to develop and commit to execution of a management and O&M plan. \nThe community(s) must have an adequate decision making structure for identifying needs, accessing resources, and \ndistributing benefits in an equitable manner to all members of the community. \nThe intervention will have a positive impact on a significant portion of the local community. \nTransboundary water issues must be adequately addressed as part of the project selection and preparation process. \nInterventions must have water resources requirements that would be in compliance with existing international \nagreements, or it must be possible to achieve a new agreement or concurrence among the concerned riparians. \nSelection Criteria for Flood Management and River Bank Erosion \nInterventions should be selected based on their ability to mitigate flood or erosion risk while providing a satisfactory \neconomic rate of return without creating negative impacts. \nInterventions that could have the potential to result in morphological changes in the river regime and generate major \nunforeseen negative impacts should be avoided, provided alternative protection measures can be identified. \nInterventions that could inadvertently result in adverse impacts on water users currently taking water from the river \nshould be avoided. \nFlood management or bank protection works are not to be considered without the inclusion of mitigating measures as \npart of the intervention if they would result in (i) the reduction of a river or wash cross section, or (ii) increased water \nsurface elevations to pass a flood of given magnitude, or (iii) pose any risk of main channel deposition or blockage. \nInterventions that have the potential to negate people's rights to riverbank access are not to be included unless \nalternative access routes are identified and confirmed with the affected communities \nSelection Criteria Specifically for Irrigation  \nCommunities receiving assistance must pledge to abstain from poppy cultivation. \nThe soils and topography must be suitable for constructing irrigation works and supporting irrigated agriculture, \nincluding adequate natural drainage, and not subject to the risk of excessive settlement, poor stability, or severe \nerosion. \nThe sustainable financial returns to all farmers from the intervention must be adequate to offset any associated cost \nincreases. \nPriority will be accorded to those investments having significant positive impact on the food production base to help \nensure food security for Afghanistan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IWRM = integrated water resources management, MEW = Ministry of Energy and \nWater, MFF = multitranche financing facility, O&M = operation and maintenance, PDF = program development \nfacility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n ", " \nORGANIZATION CHARTS \n6\n0\nFigurPer oAje7c.1t :S tPereorijnegc Ct oMmamniattgeeeCmheanirte dO bryg anization  ADB         Ap\nMinister of Energy and Water (MOF, MEW, NVDA/MAIL)  pe\nn\nd\nix\n 7\n \nPMO MEW (Kabul)  Coordination Office PMO NVDA/MAIL (Jalalabad)\n MOF \nSpecialist Teams: Technical, Legal, Finance and Specialist Teams: Technical,Legal, Finance and\n\u2022 Project Coordination \nAdministration, Gender and Safeguards, M&E and  Administration, Gender and Safeguards, M&E and \nReporting  \u2022 M&E  Reporting, Capacity Building/Institutional \nPMO Staff  Consultant (Int./Nat.)

Background \n \n1.  The Water Resources Development Investment Program (the Investment Program) for \nAfghanistan will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through a multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF) for $303.3 million over a 10-year period. The funds will be disbursed in \nthree tranches, and the Investment Program will implement a program of activities to develop \nwater  resources  in  Afghanistan  through  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing \ninfrastructure, development of new infrastructure, and capacity and institutional strengthening \nfor improved management of water resources. \n \n2.  The  first  tranche  has  three  investment  components.  The  first  component,  northern \nbasins development (NBD), will take place in the Lower Balkh River Basin and supports (i) \nconstruction of the Bangala weir, (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of the Samarkandian and \nNahre Shahi weirs, (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of approximately 250 irrigation structures on \nmain canals, (iv) pilot improvements to secondary and tertiary structures, (v) improved access \npoints for women to collect canal water, (vi) formation of water users associations (WUAs) with \ntraining and demonstrations, and (vii) strengthening the Northern Basins River Basin Agency \nand  Council.  The  second  component,  Nangahar  Valley  Development  Authority  (NVDA) \nimprovement, will support (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of the main, secondary, and tertiary \ncanals of the NVDA irrigation system, totalling about 20,000 hectares (ha); (ii) establishment of \nWUAs  and  on-farm  water  management,  and  improved  agricultural  practices  training  and \ndemonstrations;  and  (iii)  development  of  a  corporate  business  plan  to  reform  NVDA \nmanagement.  Component  3,  flood  management,  will  construct  (i)  a  6  kilometer  flood \nembankment with trial forest plantation and bank protection works along the Amu Darya River at \nYangi Qala, (ii) new headworks to control the flow of water into the Yatim Tapa irrigation canal, \nand (iii) river bank protection works to mitigate erosion. \n \nB.  Approach and Main Assumptions \n \n3.  Project interventions will provide rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation systems with \nimproved distribution structures, and in particular permanent headworks for river off-takes in the \nNBD. Since traditional systems require significant levels of annual maintenance, one benefit of \nthe  project  will  be  the  reduction  of  annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading will be supported by on-farm demonstrations for \nfarmers regarding methods for optimizing water management for improved performance and \nproduction. The flood management activities will protect rural assets. The principal benefits of \nthe Project will accrue from improvements in agricultural production, and avoided losses through \nthe protection of land, buildings, and other infrastructure from floods and bank erosion. The \nbenefits of the interventions have been estimated by comparing the with-project and without-\nproject scenarios. \n \n4.  The economic and financial analysis was undertaken using first quarter 2009 constant \nprices  and  the  exchange  rate  used  was  $1  =  AF50.  The  following  key  parameters  and \nassumptions were used in the analysis: \n \n(i)  use of the world price numeraire; \n \n(ii)  agricultural input and output prices are based on current prices reported by \nfarmers  during  surveys  carried  out  for  project  preparation,  supplemented  by \n ", "78          Appendix 12 \n \navailable market data from the project areas and available data from secondary \nsources; \n \n(iii)  a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.981 has been used for most agricultural \ninputs and outputs, except that specific conversion factors have been estimated \nfor  wheat  (0.83),  rice  (0.71),  maize  (0.77),  urea  (0.92),  and  diammonium \nphosphate  (0.66)  based  on  June  2009  international  prices  with  appropriate \nadjustments for transport, handling, marketing and processing.2 For unskilled \nlabor, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 was used to take account of surplus labor \nin rural areas; and \n \n(iv)  the project implementation period for the first tranche of the Project will be 5 \nyears and the economic life is 25 years. \n \nC.  Project Costs and Benefits \n \n5.  Project costs were estimated using prices prevailing in the first half of 2009 and include \ninvestment costs for new construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of existing infrastructure, \nsupport  for  improved  water  management  through  the  establishment  of  WUAs  and  other \nmeasures, project management, and O&M. The total cost of project interventions under the first \ntranche is $92.9 million (including contingencies). The first tranche of the project also includes \nfunding of $9.3 million for a program development facility (PDF) that will identify potential \ninvestments and carry out feasibility assessments for subsequent tranches of the Investment \nProgram. Also included is funding of $3.3 million for the Helmand Basin Master Plan, to be \ncofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom. \n \n6.  Benefits: Northern basins development. The quantified benefits of the Project\u2019s NBD \ncomponent derive from the two main interventions: (i) the construction of the Bangala weir; and \n(ii) the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 250 main canal structures in the lower Balkh \nirrigation system, which builds on work begun under the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation \nand Reconstruction Project (EIRRP).3 The Project will undertake measures to improve water \nmanagement, both on-farm and in the canal systems, including through the development of \nWUA on-farm water management demonstrations. \n \n7.  Annual crop production in the Balkh river basin depends on winter snowfalls in the \nmountains, spring rains, and the resulting river flows. In a normal year, the lower Balkh system \nintensively irrigates about 84,000 ha, although system improvements under EIRRP are reported \nto have increased the area irrigated in a normal year by 10%. The actual area receiving \nadequate irrigation varies according to the annual precipitation in a given year. \n \n8.  Construction of the Bangala weir will provide better control of diverted flows to the \ncommand areas of the Aqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals (totalling 39,200 ha), which will \nreduce operational losses in the head reaches and throughout the command areas. Overall \noperational irrigation efficiency is expected to increase from 45% to 55%. The benefits of this \nproject arise from increases in cropped area and crop yields that come about as a result of a \nmore assured water supply. The level of benefits will depend upon the farm location within the \ncanal system. The greatest impact will be in the tail reaches of canals, because improved water \n                                                 \n1  The SCF was estimated based on import and export data from the years 2007 to 2009. \n2  Details of the estimates are given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n3  ADB. 2003.

In general, no \nsignificant changes in cropping patterns have been assumed. Rehabilitation and upgrading of \nthe main canal structures will have similar, smaller impacts spread throughout the entire 84,000 \nha command area of the irrigation system.  \n \n9.  The head, middle and tail reaches of each command area are assumed to be equal in \narea and for the northern basins have present cropping intensities of 156% (head), 135% \n(middle), and 66% (tail). The wheat crop provides about one third of project benefits and at \npresent has yields of between 2.7 tons/ha in the head reaches and 1.4 tons/ha in the tail \nreaches. Other important crops are winter vegetables such as cauliflower, with yields of 15.0\u2013\n17.5  tons/ha  and  summer  melons  with  yields  up  to  25  tons/ha  in  the  head  reaches,  but \nachieving as little as 6\u20137 tons in the tail reaches where the water supply is currently unreliable. \n \n10.  The production assumptions used in the analysis and the changes in cropping intensities \nare given in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Northern Basins - With Project Increases in Agricultural Productivity \n(%) \n  Bangala Weir  R&U of Main Canal Structures \nArea  Cropping  Area  Cropping \nItem  Crop Yield  Crop Yield \nCultivated  Intensity  Cultivated  Intensity \nHead reaches  5.0  3  6.5  2  1  2.0 \nMiddle reaches  9.0  5  12.1  3  1  4.0 \nTail reaches  12.5  7  8.3  5  2  3.1 \nR&U = rehabilitation and upgrade. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.  With  the  Project,  benefits  accrue  from  an  estimated  additional  3,450  ha  due  to \nconstruction of the Bangala weir and 2,772 ha due to rehabilitation and upgrading of the main \ncanal structures. The total increase in grain production is expected to be about 9,640 tons, \nincluding wheat and maize, but principally wheat from the increased cultivated area made \npossible by the Bangala weir. There will be significant increases in the production of second-\nseason fruit and vegetables. Due to increased on-farm production activity, the increase in \ndemand for labor is expected to be about 400,000 person days/year, or some 5.2 days/ha/year \ndue to the Bangala weir and 2.4 days/ha/year due to the rehabilitation and upgrading of the \nmain canal structures. \n \n12.  No  benefits  have  been  quantified  for  other  activities  under  the  NBD  component, \nincluding the (i) rehabilitation of the Nahre Shahi and Samarkandian weirs, (ii) the upgrading of \nstructures  on  selected  secondary  and  tertiary  canals,  and  (iii)  development  of  improved \nwomen's access points to collect canal water. Benefits, potentially substantial, will also accrue \nfrom strengthening of the Northern Basins RBA that will operate the physically improved weirs \nfor more effective water management throughout the Lower Balkh Basin. The Project will also \nlead to greater production of fodder crops and straw. Both will benefit livestock production, but \nthese benefits have not been quantified. The economic returns for the component are therefore \nlower than they would be if it were possible to quantify all benefits. \n \n13.  Benefits: NVDA improvement. Current production in the NVDA area is constrained by \ndegradation  of  the  irrigation  system.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  main  canal  and \nassociated secondary and tertiary canals will restore the system to full capacity. The command \n ", "80          Appendix 12 \n \narea of the NVDA system includes four state farms covering a total of about 10,000 ha, of which \nnot more than about 7,600 ha is estimated to be cultivable, and 14,000 ha of private farms, of \nwhich about 11,900 ha is cultivated. The current cropping intensity on the state farm land is \nestimated to be 56%, but on private farms is generally between 162% and 173%, and may be \nhigher in some cases. The Project will increase water availability and reliability at the farm level. \nThe benefits accrue from increases in the area cultivated and increased project yields. In \naddition,  a  modest  increase  of  tree  crops  on  private  farms  (about  1.5%  of  total  area),  is \nassumed at the expense of grain production. Tree crops are well established in the area and \nfarmers are likely to take advantage of better water supplies to increase investment in this more \nprofitable crop. \n \n14.  Present yields are generally higher in the NVDA area than in the Balkh River Basin. In \nthe NVDA area, wheat\u2014with yields between 1.85 tons/ha in the tail reaches and 3.5 tons/ha in \nthe head reaches\u2014provides about a quarter of the benefits. Because of the proximity of both \nlocal and Pakistani markets, a wide range of winter and summer vegetables are grown, as well \nas both citrus and stone fruit. With-project changes are summarized in Table A12.2. Because of \nthe relatively low current yields on the state farm areas, a higher average increase is anticipated \nfor these areas, because improved water and on-farm management will be starting from a low \nbase. \n \nTable A12.2: Nangahar Valley Development Authority \u2014 With-Project Increases in \nAgricultural Productivity \n(%) \n  Private Farms  State Farms \nArea  Cropping  Area  Cropping \nItem  Crop Yield  Crop Yield \nCultivated  Intensity  Cultivated  Intensity \nHead reaches  4  2.0  6.3 \nMiddle reaches  8  3.5  7.7  10a  10  25.6b \nTail reaches  10  5.0  16.2 \na For existing crops. \nb Includes addition of new crops to cropping pattern. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  With the Project, an estimated additional 870 ha will be cropped in the private farm areas \nand 760 ha on the state farms. Benefits will include an increase in grain production of 4,398 \ntons, including wheat (2,723 tons), rice (1,111 tons) and maize (564 tons). Significant increases \nin fruit and vegetable production will accrue from private farmers. The increase in demand for \nlabor  arising  from  increased  on-farm  production  activities  will  be  about  220,000  person \ndays/year (11.5 days/ha). \n \n16.  Apart from the quantified benefits, benefits for the NVDA component will come from \nimprovements in water management through the establishment of and training for WUAs and \nfarmers to operate, maintain, and manage their irrigation systems. Crop diversification impacts \ntoward  higher  value  outputs  resulting  from  on-farm  demonstrations  may  also  be \nunderestimated.  Increases  in  livestock  production  that  arise  because  of  increased  fodder \nproduction with the Project have also not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n17.  Benefits: Bank erosion and flood management. The flood embankment at Yangi Qala \nand headworks at Yetim Tapa on the Amu Darya river will protect agricultural land and rural \ninfrastructure from flood damage and destruction by river bank erosion. The annual flooding can \ncause significant damage in this area, especially in high flow years. \n \n ", "Appendix 12          81           \n18.  The area to be protected by the 6 km embankment at Yangi Qala and the headworks on \nthe Yetim Tapa canal includes 5,000 ha of cultivated land, several villages, and Yangi Qala \ntown. Benefits accrue from the prevention of the damage that regularly occurs at present. Based \non data from the area, the analysis assumes that a 50-year flood (occurring once every 50 \nyears) destroys the entire summer crop, and a 5-year flood will severely damage 20% of the rice \ncrop.  Other  floods  may  occur,  with  varying  degrees  of  damage  caused,  but  they  are  not \nquantified for this analysis. Furthermore, bank erosion leads to the loss of an estimated 60 \nha/year of crop land and 10 ha/year of grazing land, as well as to the annual loss of houses and \nrelated  buildings  with  an  average  value  of  $25,000.  The  annual  value  of  crop  losses  is \nestimated at $0.56 million and the annual value of production lost from eroded land at a further \n$0.21 million.4 Large floods have caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure in \nYangi Qala town. The annual value of this loss is estimated at $0.2 million. An estimate is also \nincluded for the cost of relocating households that are losing land and houses as a result of river \nerosion. \n \nD.  Economic Analysis of the Project \n \n19.  Overall, the first tranche project has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 18.0%. \nA 20% in increase in project costs would reduce this EIRR to 14.0% and a 20% decrease in \nbenefits decrease it to 12.9%. A simultaneous increase in costs of 10% and reduction in \nbenefits of 10% would lead to an EIRR of 13.5%. The switching value at 12% for costs is \n+31.6% and for benefits is \u201323.2%. A delay of 2 years in achieving benefits would result in an \nEIRR of 13.9%. \n \n20.  The NBD component has an EIRR of 16.9%. A 20% increase in costs for this component \nreduces the EIRR to 12.7%, while a 20% decrease in benefits would result in an EIRR of only \n11.4%. A simultaneous increase in costs of 10% and reduction in benefits of 10% would lead to \nan EIRR of 12.1%.  Switching values are +23.9% for costs and \u201317.9% for benefits. Crop yield \nincreases achieved have a greater impact on these results than the increase in irrigated area. \n \n21.  The EIRR for the NVDA improvement component is 18.4%. A 20% increase in costs \nwould produce an EIRR of 13.9%, and a 20% decrease in benefits an EIRR of 12.6%. The \ncombination of a 10% increase in costs and 10% decrease in benefits gives an EIRR of 13.3%. \nSwitching  values  at  12%  are  +29.5%  for  costs  and  \u201321.9%  for  benefits.  The  economic \nindicators for this component are robust for variations in key variables. \n \n22.  The EIRR for the flood management component is 20.4%. The combination of a 10% \nincrease in costs and a 10% decrease in benefits would give an EIRR of 17.6%, while a 20% \nincrease in costs alone produces an EIRR of 17.6%, and a 20% decrease in benefits an EIRR \nof  17.5%.  Switching  values  are  +85.9%  for  costs  and  \u201352.1%  for  benefits,  making  this \ncomponent extremely robust. \n \nE.  Assessment of Financial Impacts \n \n23.  The Project will have a positive impact on household incomes and food security and will \ncontribute to the reduction of poverty. In the Northern Basins, the demand for farm labor will \nincrease due to the larger cropped area and the expected increases in cropping intensity, but \nincreases per ha are not large and likely to be met within households themselves. \n \n                                                 \n4  The value of production from eroded land is cumulative and increases by $0.21 million per year. \n ", "82          Appendix 12 \n \n24.  The financial impact of the project on farm households will vary by location within the \nirrigation system, with impacts directly related to the relative increase in water availability. The \ngreatest impact on households under the NBD component will be for those along the Aqcha, \nCharboloc, and Faizabad canals below Bangala weir. On average, it is expected that the farm \nincome of the households in the head reaches of these canals will increase by AF8,600/ha/year \n($172), or 8.2% of present average income. In the middle reaches of the canals, household \nincomes will increase by an average AF12,200/ha/year ($244), or 17.3% of present income. The \ngreatest impact will occur in the tail reaches of the canals; although average household farm \nincome is estimated to increase by only AF4,600/ha/year ($92), this represents an increase of \n27.5% over the present situation. \n \n25.  Rehabilitation and upgrading of main canal structures generates small increases in \nhousehold farm income throughout the Lower Balkh irrigation system. These include an average \nof (i) AF2,450/ha/year ($49) for households in the head reaches, or 2.3% of present farm \nincome; (ii)  AF2,450/ha/year ($49) for households along middle reaches, or a 3.5% increase; \nand  (iii)  AF1,050/ha/year  ($21)  along  tail  reaches,  representing  an  increase  of  6.2%  from \npresent levels. \n \n26.  For  NVDA  Improvement,  increases  in  private  farm  household  incomes  from  the \nexpected changes in cropped area, crop yields and cropping patterns are estimated to be \nAF20,300/ha/year ($406 or 8.6%) in the head reaches of canals, AF23,400/ha/year ($468, or \n12.9%) in the middle reaches, and AF23,000/ha/year ($460, or 21.1%) in the tail reaches. Farm \nincomes are higher in this area than in the Northern Basins and the benefits are larger because \nthe cropping pattern is more diversified and there is greater emphasis on the production of \nhigher-value crops. \n \n27.  The bank erosion and flood management component, while protecting households from \npotential losses of income and assets, will have no direct impact on household incomes for \nthose living in the area affected by the proposed embankment and headworks. \n \nF.  Poverty Impacts of the Project \n \n28.  The increases in farm household income anticipated with the Project will reduce overall \npoverty levels in the project areas. However, specific impacts on households are difficult to \nassess. Average household size is assumed to be seven persons,5 for which the average \nannual household income (at the poverty line income of $14/person/month) would be $1,176 \n(AF58,800). In the NBD component, an average family on the head reach of a canal would \nrequire 0.56 ha to achieve this income at present, compared with 0.83 ha on a middle reach and \n3.5 ha on a tail reach. With implementation of the Bangala weir, average households on the \nAqcha, Charboloc, and Faizabad canals would be able to achieve the poverty level income with \n0.52 ha on the head, 0.71 ha on the middle, and 2.75 ha on the tail reaches. Rehabilitation and \nupgrading of main canal structures will have similar but smaller impacts. Many households have \nsmall holdings of less than 1 ha; where these are located on the head and middle reaches of \ncanals, the Project will enable some\u2014and possibly a significant number\u2014of households to \nmove above the poverty line. While the absolute poverty reduction impact in the tail reaches \nmay be smaller, the relative impact will be larger. \n \n                                                 \n5  Information on household size for the Northern Basins and the NVDA area is sparse and probably not reliable.  The \naverage of seven people per household that was used is an indicative figure, based on: World Food Programme \nand Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 2004. National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. Kabul.  \n ", "Appendix 12          83           \n29.  In the NVDA area, an average household requires between 0.54 ha and 0.25 ha in the \ntail and head reaches for household farm income to be above the poverty level at present, and \nabout between about 0.44 ha and 0.23 ha with the Project. While average farm sizes are small, \nthe relative productivity of private farms in the NVDA area suggests that poverty levels for those \nwith landholdings are relatively low. However, households that depend only on the farming of \nleased state land would have household incomes below the poverty line both without and with \nthe Project.6 \n \n30.  Poverty impact ratios were calculated for each component and are 56% for the northern \nbasins, 58% for the NVDA, and 49% for the flood management components. \n \nTable A12.3: Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis \n \nBank \nNorthern  Erosion and  Project  \nItem  NVDA \nBasins  Flood  (first tranche) \nManagement  \nCommand Area (ha)         \nGeographic area  84,000  25,000  5,000  114,000 \nIncremental cropped area  5,598  1,627    7,225 \nBenefits at full development          \n ($ million/year)  9.51  7.21  3.29a  20.24 \nInvestment cost ($ million) (base costs) b         \na.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) recognizes the need to sustain high growth rates in the medium \nterm to generate employment and reduce poverty.a Agriculture generates about 50% of gross domestic product and employs \nabout two thirds of all Afghans; 19 million people (or nearly 80% of the population) live in rural areas, which have the highest \nincidence of poverty. Agricultural and rural economic growth are essential for sustained improvement in national livelihoods. \nReliable irrigation water is critical to achieving this growth, because irrigated agriculture produces 80% all agricultural output. \nTo achieve the Government\u2019s poverty-reduction goals, economic growth has to be accelerated and supported by a sustained \nincrease of 5%\u20138% per year in the agriculture sector. Growth of the agricultural sector will in large part determine the rate of \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and reliable irrigation water is essential to agricultural growth in Afghanistan. \n \nAccording to data from the 2005 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment data, about 45% of the rural population is poor, \nas opposed to 27% of those who live in urban areas.b  Rural populations have the highest rates of food insecurity, with 45% \nnot meeting minimum food requirements. In addition to facing high food insecurity, rural households have less access to \ninfrastructure and basic public services. Their level of education is low and rates of illiteracy high. \n \nThe country partnership strategy (CPS) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is fully aligned with ANDS priorities and \noutcomes, and the CPS highlights four sectors for ADB investments: (i) energy; (ii) transportation and communication; and (iii) \nagriculture and natural resources, including irrigation and water resources management; and (iv) governance.c \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (geographic) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s human development indicators are among the lowest in the world.d Some 12 million Afghans, or 42% of the \npopulation, live below the poverty line, with monthly incomes of about $14 per capita. About 45% of the population is \nestimated to be unable to purchase sufficient food to guarantee the world standard minimum food intake of 2,100 calories per \nday.e The national literacy rate was only 28% in 2008, and the literacy rate among women only 16%. Only 31% of the \npopulation has access to safe drinking water, and 12% is believed to have access to sanitation. In addition, life expectancy in \nAfghanistan is under 45 years, at least 10 years below that of any other Asian country. Over 20% of all Afghan children die \nbefore the age of 5, half of Afghanistan\u2019s school-age children are not in school, and 57% of the population is under 18 years \nof age. Gender inequality is rife across all sectors, resulting in particularly difficult circumstances for women.f \n \nA number of factors have contributed to the country\u2019s overall high poverty incidence, but it has primarily been a result of 30 \nyears of civil conflict, and the associated political instability and lack of security, which stifled economic growth and social \ndevelopment. The coincident arrivals of returning refugees and internally displaced people (IDP) and the resultant growth in \nlandlessness have in some areas increased pressure on the resource base beyond sustainable levels. The information below \nwas collected under the social assessment carried out in the project areas during the preparation of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Investment Program. \n \n(i)  In Imam Sahib District, 65% to 90% of families in the area close to the flooding and bank erosion along the Amu Darya \nRiver are below the poverty line. These high poverty rates are due to the ongoing river bank erosion and the \ndisplacement of a large number of families and villages. \n(ii)  The lower Balkh River Basin has an average poverty rate among all villages of about 70%; 83% of families interviewed \nwere below the poverty line in Khulm district, and 65% in Balkh district.  \n(iii)  In the Nangahar Valley Development Authority (NVDA) area, the poverty incidence ranges from 44% to 88% in Beshood \ndistrict, where there are large numbers of IDP and returnees. \n \n ", "   Appendix 13           85 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe main livelihood activities in the project areas include irrigated agriculture, livestock, and hired labor. The proportion of \nfamilies that are landless range from about 28% in Amu Darya basin to 95% in the Jalalabad area due to the influx of \nreturning refugees and IDP. Limited farm production arising from poor water availability and the lack of employment \nopportunities are key social issues. Crop losses are reported in all areas, mainly due to the unreliable water supply, which is \nchronic at the tail end of many irrigation canals. In addition, bank erosion and flooding have negatively affected farm output in \nthe villages along the Amu Darya River. At the time of the field assessment, few households had surplus grain to sell: the \nassessment recorded zero in Nangahar, and 17% in the Yangi Qala area. The rural labor pool is increasing with many unable \nto find work opportunities.  \n \nThe Project's northern basins development component will improve water reliability in the irrigated areas of the Lower Balkh \nRiver Basin resulting in increased yields, expanded irrigated area, and increased cropping intensities, This will translate into \nhigher incomes for farm families. The impact will be more pronounced in the tail reaches of the command areas. The size of \nthe population that benefits will depend on the amount of irrigation water available, but in many years, up to 500,000 persons \ncould directly benefit from the improvements (assuming an average family size of seven people). Similar benefits will be \ngenerated by the project in the NVDA area, but given the smaller size of the irrigated area, about 150,000 persons will directly \nbenefit  from  the  irrigated  agricultural  productivity.  The  increased  agricultural  productivity  will  also  support  substantial \nadditional labor opportunities, much of which may be captured by family members, and stimulate value chains associated with \nagricultural production. While many families in the area may not directly benefit through higher incomes from bank erosion \nand flood protection, many in the area will have a much lower risk of losing productive assets. There are approximately \n240,000 persons in the Yangi Qala area and Iman Sahib, although not all of them are at risk of floods. However, the flood risk \nprotection for the Yetim Tapa irrigation system will directly benefit close to 40,000 persons.g \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations were undertaken by the project preparation consultants with farmer irrigators, the landless, sharecroppers, \nherders, community elders, officials from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and government authorities. In addition, \nsmall workshops and meetings were held in each of the project component areas, and a large final tripartite workshop was \nheld in Kabul at the end of the project preparation. The views of the communities and proposed project beneficiaries were \nincorporated into the project design. Consultation is integral to the project design with regard to the development of water \nusers associations (WUAs), which will be empowered to assume formal responsibility for the management and operation and \nmaintenance of large portions of the irrigation system, and will share decision-making responsibility for infrastructure \nimprovements. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes      No  \n \nDuring project implementation, there will be significant interaction with the local farmers as a part of the WUA development \nand training program. Local NGOs will support implementation of this effort, which by its very nature will be participatory and \ninvolve ongoing consultation with farmers and community members.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nField assessments indicated that gender roles in the project areas are determined by tradition, with women engaged in \nselected activities, of which homemaking is the most important. The percentage of families headed by women ranges from 3% \nto 10%. Women are concerned about the lack of food, income, work opportunities, and health facilities, and by drinking water \nshortages. They are concerned about not enjoying the freedom to work on income generation projects (which stems mainly \nfrom cultural reasons).  \n \nThe Investment Program is not expected to explicitly address existing gender concerns and has few activities to address \nongoing gender differences or to create a high gender impact. Because gender roles are unlikely to change and the \nInvestment Program's  main activities do not  address gender  concerns, there are unlikely  to be any gender impacts resulting \n ", "86         Appendix 13 \nfrom implementation of the project. However, to address gender-related concerns associated with irrigation, the project will \nimprove access sites at irrigation canals where women traditionally gather to wash clothes and collect water. Under the \nproject, the gender specialist will work with the WUAs and community development councils to solicit women's view on the \ndesign and location of the access points. This intervention along with possible other interventions will be scaled up in \nsubsequent tranches with irrigation activities. \n2.  Key Actions.

Scope  and  impacts.  The  Afghanistan  Water  Resource  Development  Investment \nProgram (the Investment Program) will increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture due to \nimproved water resources management through infrastructure development, capacity building, \nand institutional strengthening. The first tranche includes three investment components: (i) the \nnorthern basins development (NBD) component will take place in the Lower Balkh River Basin \nand  support  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  and  development  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  and \ncapacity and institutional development for the river basin agency and water user associations; (ii) \nthe  Nangahar  Valley  Development  Authority  (NVDA)  improvement  component  will  support \nrehabilitation and upgrading of the NVDA irrigation systems, and the development of WUAs and \na corporate business plan for NVDA; and (iii) the flood management component will construct a \nflood embankment and bank protection works. \n \n2.  A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was prepared that outlines the \npolicy,  procedures  and  institutional  requirements  for  preparing  and  implementing  land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for interventions under the Investment Program. \nThe  first  tranche  of the  Investment  Program  has currently  been  classified  as resettlement \ncategory  B.  Both  the  NBD  and  flood  management  components  have  limited  associated \nresettlement  activities,  and  short  LARPs  have  been  prepared.  Farm  land  compensation  is \nrequired for (i) five families on the proposed Bangala weir site under the NBD component, and \n(ii) 19 families on the proposed embankment site under the flood management component. In \nboth cases, no household relocation is required and the impacts are minimal. The LARF and \nshort LARPs can be found in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n3.  Resettlement  policy.  Resettlement  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with \nAfghanistan\u2019s  land  expropriation  act  (2000)  and  its  amendment  (2005)  and  relevant  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policies, in particular, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand Operations Manual.1  \n \n4.  Resettlement  principles,  entitlements,  and  procedures. The LARF applies to all \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts arising from land acquisition and/or conversion, or any other \nimpacts that arise from the Investment Program, including to people with no formal title to land. \nThe LARF principles include the following: (i) potential impacts on affected peoples should be \navoided or minimized; (ii) if impacts are unavoidable, affected persons will be identified and \nassisted in maintaining their standards of living at pre-project level; (iii) attention will be paid to \nidentify  the  presence  of  and  involve  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  indigenous \npeople;2 (iv) information on the preparation and implementation of the LARF will be disclosed to \nall affected persons and their involvement throughout the process will be ensured; (v) land \nacquisition and compensation will be paid in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement \npolicy and the country\u2019s relevant laws; (vi) affected persons will be paid compensation for their \nlands, properties, and assets prior to taking the acquired land and assets; (vii) an entitlement \nmatrix will include details of entitlements for all affected persons, including compensation at \nreplacement  costs,  allowances,  income  restoration  and  livelihood  improvement;  and  (viii) \nvulnerable  households  and  persons  will  receive  a  further  cash  allowance  of  20%  of  the \nresettlement costs. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008.

The types of loss and entitlements will cover: (i) loss of titleholders, including agricultural \nand  homestead  lands,  assets,  commercial  land  and  structures,  residential  tenancy,  and \ncommercial tenancy; (ii) loss of non-title holders, including (a) agricultural lands held by tenants \nand sharecroppers (whether registered or not), squatters and encroachers; (b) homestead land; \nand (c) commercial structures held by informal tenants, squatters and encroachers; (iii) loss of \nlivelihoods, including loss of (a) wage earnings, (b) income and/or food, and (c) rangeland \nincome; (iv) additional support to vulnerable groups, including women and widows; (v) loss of \ncommunity infrastructure and resources such as grazing areas; and (vi) any other impacts (i.e., \ntemporary impacts during infrastructure construction or any other unforeseen impacts).  \n \n6.

The methodology for assessing minimum compensation rates of different items is as \nfollows: \n(i)  Land will be valued at replacement cost based on market rates derived from a \nsurvey of land sales in the year before the impact survey. No deductions for \ntaxes or transaction costs will be applied. \n(ii)  Houses and buildings will be valued at replacement value based on cost of \nmaterials, type of construction, labor, transport, and other construction costs. No \ndeductions will  be applied for depreciation, salvaged materials, and transaction \ncosts \n(iii)  Annual crops will be valued at full market rate at the farm gate.  \n(iv)  Fruit trees will be valued based on age category and productivity. Productive \ntrees will be valued at the market value of 1 year of produce multiplied by the \nnumber of years needed to grow a new tree with the same productive potential \nas the lost tree.  \n(v)  Timber trees will be valued at the market value of timber. Affected persons will be \nprovided with free planting materials, or paid the cost of the materials.  \n \n8.  Initial asset valuation will be the responsibility of the project management office (PMO), \nexecuted with support of the implementation consultants, which will be verified and certified by \n ", "Appendix 14          91           \nthe  regional  property  valuation  team  headed  by  the  senior  property  supervisor,  and  then \napproved by the implementing agency (IA). If the land or property is being acquired with the \nowners' consent, this valuation will be used as the basis of negotiation between the owners and \nthe local authorities. \n \n9.  Institutional  responsibilities,  arrangements,  and  procedures. Two PMOs will be \nestablished within the IAs: one within the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) for the NBD and \nflood management components, and the second within the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and \nLivestock (MAIL) for the NVDA improvement component. The PMOs have overall planning, \nsupervising, monitoring, and coordination responsibilities for preparing and executing LARPs \nunder the Investment Program.3 The actual work will be undertaken by the specialists and \nconsultants that will be attached to the PMO as well as officials attached to relevant line \nagencies. The PMOs will be responsible for undertaking such activities as surveys, censuses, \npublic consultations and information disclosures, grievance redress, monitoring, the preparation \nof LARPs and their dissemination in local languages; line agencies will be responsible for \nactivities such as land surveying, title registration, land acquisition, compensation payment, and \nrelocation, as the agencies have the authority to undertake such activities under prevailing law. \nThe PMO will be assisted as needed by a nongovernment organization (NGO) to work with local \ncommunities for the preparation and implementation of the LARPs. LARP final drafts will be \nsubmitted for approval of both the IA and ADB.4 \n \n10.  Disclosure, consultation, and grievances. The consultation with all affected persons \nwill be an ongoing process throughout LARP planning and implementation. Affected persons will \nbe fully informed of all steps in the planning and implementation of the process. All information \nincluding the entitlement matrix will be disclosed to affected persons in the local language. Local \nchannels for information disclosure (such as announcements at market days) will be planned \nand implemented as part of the information disclosure process. A grievance redress process will \nbe implemented in respect of all activities under the Investment Program where resettlement \nactions are required. The grievance redress will be facilitated by the community and supported \nby an NGO as required. The procedures for the grievance resolution process are based on the \nproject implementation arrangements involving the PMO and IA; if the process is unsuccessful, \nthe affected persons will have the option of addressing their grievances through formal court \nprocedures, with the support of an NGO. \n \nTable A14.2: Grievance Resolution Process \nLand and Crops Compensation Issues \n1. Grievance resolution will be attempted through a district committee comprised of the district governor, senior \ndistrict property supervisor, and implementation NGO. \n2. In absence of a settlement, affected persons may appeal to the PMO director. The director will decide the case within 15 \ndays and inform the affected person. \n3. If the PMO decision is unacceptable to the affected persons, they can register their complaint directly with the IA within \n1 month of receiving a response from the PMO, with documents to support their claim. The IA will respond within 15 days \nof registering the complaint. The IA\u2019s decision must be in compliance with the LARF provisions. \n4. Should all three levels of this grievance redress system fail to satisfy the affected person, he or she may \napproach the appropriate court of law for resolution of the grievance. The affected person will be facilitated in this \nprocess by an implementing NGO.  \nIA = implementing agency, LARF = land acquisition and resettlement framework, NGO = nongovernment organization, \nPMO = project management office.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n                                                 \n3 It is not anticipated that any resettlement activities will be required under the NVDA component. \n4 If the final designs have to be changed, the resettlement plans will be modified, including the completion of a new \nsocial assessment, and the revised resettlement plans will be submitted to the IA and ADB for their approval. \n ", "92          Appendix 14 \n \n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. The PMO will establish a monitoring and evaluation system \nfor each project involving land acquisition. The monitoring and evaluation system includes an \ninternal  monitoring  program  to  be  planned  and  implemented  by  the  PMO.  In  addition,  an \nexternal  monitoring  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  external  monitoring  agency  to  be \nrecruited  and  appointed  by  the  PMO  after  ADB  approval.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be \nestablished as appropriate. The external monitoring agency will file independent monitoring \nreports.  \n \n12.  Resettlement cost. Each LARP will have its own costs, which will be part of the overall \nbudget for the investment tranche. The resettlement cost will include compensation, allowances, \nand  implementation  support  costs.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  agreed  to  pay \nresettlement compensation costs. For the first tranche, all costs have been calculated and \nincluded for updating and implementing the short LARP and associated compensation.\u00a0\n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090902161817+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091007143621+08'00'", "Title": ""}}
