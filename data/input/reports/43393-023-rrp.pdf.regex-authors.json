THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) Third Ring Road (RR3) \nTechnical Assistance Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n2.  The  project  will  prepare  (i)  a  detailed  design  and  detailed  design  appraisal, \nenvironmental and social safeguard documents, and bidding and contract documents for the \nTan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of the HCMC RR3 (28.4 kilometers [km]) and an extension road to \nNational Highway 1 (5.9 km); and (ii) detailed feasibility studies and environmental and social \nsafeguard documents, including social impact assessment, environmental impact assessment, \nand resettlement plans, for the National Highway 22\u2013Binh Chuan section (17.5 km) and Ben \nLuc\u2013National Highway 22 section (29.2 km) of the HCMC RR3. Collectively these comprise the \nRR3 project sections. The small-scale project preparatory TA study,1 completed in December \n2012, confirmed that the RR3 project sections in the first phase require a controlled-access four-\nlane toll expressway and free-access two-lane service roads on both sides of the expressway. \nThe estimated total investment cost for the three remaining sections of the RR3 is about $2.2 \nbillion. Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the provincial authorities plan to seek and mobilize this \namount from official development assistance, counterpart funding, and domestic and foreign \ninvestors during 2015\u20132020.2   \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  HCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam, with a population in its greater urban area of over \n9 million, which is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2025. The metropolitan area is the \nprimary  engine  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  development,  accounting  for  nearly  40%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  The  integrated  management  of  the  urban  expansion  of \nHCMC and its adjoining provinces is viewed as the key to the sustainable growth of the city-\nregion. However, due to rapid traffic growth and low road densities, many major roads and \nhighways in the project area have reached their capacity; the resulting severe traffic congestion \nand rising logistical costs pose serious constraints to HCMC\u2019s continued economic growth and \ncompetitiveness. The existing RR2, with a length of 55 km, is no longer able to provide the \nneeded capacity. Therefore, construction of two further ring roads, i.e., RR3 and RR4  on the \nperiphery of HCMC is the government\u2019s strategic priority and included in the HCMC transport \nmaster plan.3  \n \n4.  The proposed HCMC RR3, to be constructed at a radius of about 25 km from the city \ncenter, will facilitate the diversion of through traffic and reduce traffic congestion in HCMC. The \nRR3 will also improve connectivity with the surrounding cities and towns, and help reduce \ntransport costs and travel times for the movement of passengers and goods in and around \nHCMC. Once operational, it will relieve stress from other arterial routes and provide needed \ncapacity. HCMC is also a hub for the primary regional and national transport corridors, such as \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh City Outer \nRing Roads Project. Manila.  \n2  The government has requested Korea Eximbank to finance parts of the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section in the amount \nof $200 million. Currently $200 million for this section has been earmarked from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nordinary capital resources in 2016. \n3  The HCMC Transport Master Plan was approved in Decision 568/QD-TTg by the Prime Minister on 8 April 2013. \nThe Detailed Master Plan for RR3 was approved in Decision 1697/QD-TTg by the Prime Minister on 28 September \n2011 and corresponds with the HCMC Master Plan. \n ", "2   \n \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion eastern and southern corridors, and the national North\u2013South \nExpressway. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), together with other development partners, \nhas provided assistance to develop these radial corridors, which will be linked together via the \nHCMC RR3.4 The proposed RR3 is expected to sufficiently address the traffic capacity needs at \nleast up to 2020. Consideration for a RR4 or a viaduct above the RR3 may then become \nnecessary. . \n \n5.  Considering the complexity of the HCMC RR3 investment project in terms of social and \nenvironmental,  as  well  as  technical  and  financial  aspects,  with  plans  for  private  sector \ninvolvement,  the  government  is  facing  constraints  in  its  capacity  to  develop  the  project \nindependently without any external support. To help implement its strategy, and to engage ADB \nas the potential financier for the ensuing investment project, the government has requested \nADB to provide a TA Project to ensure the investment project\u2019s design readiness, update cost \nestimates, as well as identify feasible financing options for the three project sections of the \nHCMC RR3. The TA Project has been included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \n(COBP), 2013\u20132015,5 with the ensuing HCMC RR3 investment project in COBP, 2015\u201320176 \nas standby for 2017. The feasibility study, including the basic design for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon \nTrach section, was prepared in 2012 under financing from the Export-Import Bank of Korea.7 \nThe TA Project\u2019s outline was approved by the Prime Minister on 27 March 2013.8 The TA \nProject is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam, which \nfocuses on assisting the country\u2019s transport sector in improving its institutional, financial, and \noperational efficiency to maintain sufficient transport infrastructure, including provincial roads, \nnational highways, and expressways, and to improve road safety.9  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the project will be enhanced construction of the HCMC RR3, contributing \nto reduced traffic congestion in and improved connectivity of HCMC with surrounding cities and \ntowns. The outcome will be the design readiness of the HCMC RR3 project for financing. \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The outputs of the project will be (i) completed detailed feasibility and social safeguard \nstudies for the Ben Luc\u2013National Highway 22 and National Highway\u2013Binh Chuan sections; and \n(ii) updated due diligence, completed detailed design, and project and safeguard documents \nrequired to finance construction of the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section and extension road to \nNational Highway 1.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing  \n \n8.  The project is estimated to cost $13.21 million, inclusive of local taxes, contingencies \nand financing charges during development. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n                                                 \n4  The ADB-financed Greater Mekong Subregion Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project connects with the Ben \nLuc (ending point of the RR3) to Nhon Trach (starting point of the RR3). \n5  ADB. 2012.

Cuu Long CIPM, on behalf of MOT, will carry out all day-to-day activities, \nincluding  recruitment  of  consultants,  under  the  project.  The  project  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM (footnote 9). The HCMC RR3 \nwill  pass  through  HCMC,  Dong  Nai,  Binh  Duong,  and  Long  An  provinces.  The  peoples\u2019 \ncommittees  of  HCMC  and  the  three  provinces  have  the  primary  responsibility  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities on the respective road sections under the provincial \nauthority. Cuu Long CIPM will collaborate with the provincial people\u2019s committees on detailed \ndesign and preparation of resettlement plans to ensure that the project section designs are in \nline with the city and provincial transport master plans and address the needs of the local \ncommunities. A project stakeholder panel will be established to ensure effective coordination of \nproject activities.

The proposed alignment for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section and extension road to \nNational Highway 1 prepared under the Export-Import Bank of Korea-financed feasibility studies  \nwas  selected  on  the  basis  of  engineering  difficulty,  construction  cost,  and  social  and \nenvironmental impacts. The government has consulted HCMC, Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long \nAn provinces to confirm the alignment and feasibility study findings.  \n \n \n ", "6   \n \n17.  In the first phase, the RR3 project sections will comprise a four-lane expressway, with \ntwo-lane service roads on both sides of the expressway, and a maximum total right-of-way width \nof 67 meters \u201374.5 meters.13 An additional four-lane expressway is proposed to be constructed \nin the future to meet RR3 traffic demand in 2030 by building a viaduct structure in the middle of \nthe RR3, which will result in lower land acquisition and resettlement costs than if a ground level \nexpressway was constructed. This detail will be finalized in the feasibility report. \n \n18.  Future efficient operation of the service roads along the RR3 will be important for local \npublic bus transportation, and local short-distance traffic, including motorized and non-motorized \nvehicles, and pedestrians. This will be taken into account in the preparation of the detailed \ndesigns under the TA Project by giving consideration to urban transportation facilities such as \nbus stops and public parking areas. Furthermore, overpass and underpass structures to cross \nthe RR3, and intersections and interchanges (with existing routes and those currently under \nconstruction)  will  be  designed  in  response  to  local  traffic  and  travel  demands,  ensuring \nconnectivity in line with national and provincial transport master plans. \n \n19.  In addition to technical, financial, economic and safeguards due diligence, the feasibility \nstudies will include preparation of a climate change assessment for both the National Highway \n22\u2013Binh Chuan and the Ben Luc\u2013National Highway 22 sections of the RR3, including the \nfollowing: (i) overseeing and coordinating the implementation of a draft strategy for vulnerability, \nimpact, and adaptation assessments for the two road sections; (ii) identifying and discussing the \nadaptation objective with all relevant stakeholders; (iii) synthesizing vulnerability and impact \ninformation collected by other members of the team into the decision matrix provided by ADB; \n(iv) organizing and leading multi-stakeholder consultations to identify and prioritize adaptation \noptions based on an economic assessment, in addition to any other prioritization conditions \nidentified  (i.e.,  through  multi-criteria  analysis);  (v)  recommending  adaptation  options  in  a \npresentation to the government, ADB, and other relevant stakeholders; (vi) ensuring integration \nof adaptation components into the project design; and (vii) identifying additional training needs, \nindicators for monitoring, and funding for adaptation components as needed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The economic assessment prepared under the TA for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh Outer \nRing Roads Project (footnote 1) shows that the ensuing RR3 project is economically viable, with \nan economic internal rate of return of 16.6%. The net present value of net benefits using a \ndiscount rate of 12% is $878 million. The financial viability of and financing options for the \nHCMC RR3 investment are not conclusive at this stage. The TA consultants\u2019 presentation \nduring the loan fact-finding mission in November 2013 indicated the financial internal rate of \nreturn of the HCMC RR3 would be 10.4%\u201313.7%, which would make the project potentially \nattractive to financial investors (depending on their respective cost of capital). However, there \nare discrepancies between these and earlier figures. Therefore, a detailed financial analysis that \nthoroughly examines the financial viability of each project section of the HCMC RR3 investment \nis needed. The TA Project will reassess the economic and financial viability of the ensuing \ninvestment  project.  Moreover,  the  financial  analysis  under  the  TA  Project  will  explore  and \nidentify feasible financing options for the HCMC RR3 investment, including a standalone project \nloan, multitranche financing facility, and private sector investment.  \n \n                                                 \n13 Government of Viet Nam. 2013.

MOT and Cuu Long CIPM have extensive experience implementing externally \nfinanced projects. Cuu Long CIPM is currently implementing the Central Mekong Delta Region \nConnectivity  Project  (CMDRCP),  financed  by  ADB,14 for  which  it  has  mobilized  12  staff \nmembers from four different divisions (five from the Investment and Business Division, four from \nthe Cao Lanh Bridge Management Division, two from the Financial and Accounting Division, \nand one from the Cuu Long CIPM Hanoi Branch Office). Cuu Long CIPM plans to mobilize a \ntotal of seven staff members for the HCMC RR3 TA Project who are not involved in the \nCMDRCP (three from Investment and Business Division, one from Financial and Accounting \nDivision,  one  from  its  Hanoi  Branch  Office,  and  two  from  the  RR3  Project  Management \nDivision). Furthermore, a comprehensive capacity-building training program for Cuu Long CIPM \nis included in the ongoing CMDRCP. This training will further improve the skills of Cuu Long \nCIPM staff in procurement and project administration. \n \n22.  Cuu  Long  CIPM  is  found  to  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity  and \ncapability for project implementation, and is sufficiently staffed with experienced accountants. \nGiven  that  the  accounting  staff  in  Cuu  Long  is  experienced  in  and  familiar  with  financial \nmanagement  practices  for  projects  funded  by  ADB,  and  that  Cuu  Long  CIPM  has  sound \nfinancial accounting, reporting, auditing, and internal control systems, the financial management \narrangements are considered capable of and adequate for implementing the project.  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 9).  \n \n24.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2012, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements between the government and \nADB. \n \n25.  Cuu Long CIPM will maintain separate financial records and accounts adequate to \nidentify financing resources received and project expenditures, including goods, works, and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor acceptable to ADB. Cuu Long CIPM shall prepare and submit annual audited reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The \nADB Public Communications Policy requires that audited financial statements be disclosed. \nFurther details on disbursement, auditing, and financial management are provided in the PAM \n(footnote  9).  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  project  financial  management,  an \nindependent  auditing  consultant  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  recruited  to  ensure  timely \nsubmission of audited financial reports under the TA loan.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  A  social  impact  assessment,  including  gender  analysis,  will  be  carried  out  during \nimplementation of the project, and a social action plan will be prepared to ensure that social \nbenefits are maximized in a gender-responsive and culturally appropriate manner. \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2013.

Manila.  \n \n ", "8   \n \n \n27.  Cuu Long CIPM, with assistance from the feasibility study consultants, will undertake \npublic consultations in the project-affected areas during the preparation of the environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) study for all sections of the proposed RR3 project. The consultations \nwill be done to inform the public about the project, to present anticipated environmental impacts, \nand to identify relevant environmental issues and concerns so these can be considered and \naddressed in the EIA. Such consultations will involve local residents and business owners in the \nvicinity of the project area, and representatives of organizations and facilities (e.g., schools, \nmedical  facilities,  places  of  worship,  and  offices)  that  will  be  affected  during  ongoing \nconstruction  and  operation.  Other  stakeholders  include  representatives  of  nongovernment \norganizations, people\u2019s organizations (women, youth, etc.), local government units, and other \nconcerned  government  agencies.  The  consultations  will  be  undertaken  early  in  the  EIA \npreparation period to enable relevant concerns raised by stakeholders to be addressed in the \nEIA. Another consultation will present the draft EIA findings. The public consultations will be \ndocumented in the EIA, which will be publicly disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project comprises preparatory work for the HCMC RR3 project, and \nwill involve preparation of an EIA. The project will include careful determination of the alignment, \navoiding  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  developing  environmentally  friendly  highway \ndesigns. An EIA has been prepared for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of RR3 project under \nthe feasibility study financed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea in 2012.15 The feasibility study \nconsultant will prepare an EIA, based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), which will \ncover all three sections of the RR3 project. The consultant will also prepare separate EIAs for \nthe  Binh  Chuan\u2013National  Highway  22  section  and  National  Highway  22\u2013Ben  Luc  section \nfollowing Viet Nam\u2019s environmental requirements. The detailed design consultant will ensure \nthat relevant aspects of the environmental management plan included in the EIA (based on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement) are also included in the bidding and contract documents for \ncivil works. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project will not cause any \nadverse involuntary resettlement impacts. However, construction of the RR3 will have significant \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts as a result of loss of agricultural and residential land.16 As part \nof the project, the detailed design consultant and detailed feasibility consultant will work with \nMOT, Cuu Long CIPM, affected households, local authorities, and other stakeholders in the \npreparation of the resettlement plans for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach Section and Binh Chuan\u2013\nNational Highway 22 and National Highway 22\u2013Ben Luc sections, respectively, in accordance \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. It is anticipated that there will be no impacts on indigenous \npeoples or ethnic groups, but this will be confirmed during the detailed design and detailed \nfeasibility studies.  \n \n30.  Consultation and disclosure plans will be part of the resettlement plans and social action \nplans for the RR3 project to ensure meaningful consultation and provision of clear and timely \n                                                 \n15 The EIA was endorsed by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources on 14 January 2013 and is being \nrevised prior to being resubmitted to the Ministry.   \n16 Based on a draft resettlement plan prepared for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach Section under the Export-Import Bank of \nKorea-financed feasibility study in 2012, about 285 hectares of land will be affected, and an estimated 1,200 \nhouseholds will be physically and economically displaced. No information is available on the estimated number of \naffected households for the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach Section and Binh Chuan\u2013National Highway 22 and National \nHighway 22\u2013Ben Luc sections, but it is expected that impacts are also significant for these sections.   ", "9 \n \ninformation  to  the  affected  households  and  various  stakeholders.  The  consultation  and \ndisclosure plans will include consultation meetings, focus group discussions, separate meetings \nwith women and vulnerable households, preparation of information booklets, and use of radio \nand TV to disseminate information about the project and associated social and resettlement-\nrelated issues.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The  main  risks  relate  to  potential  project  delays  caused  by  delay  in  government \napprovals  and  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  slow  implementation.  These  risks  will  be \nmitigated by engaging with the government to ensure timely approvals, carrying out advance \nactions on consultant recruitment, ensuring Cuu Long CIPM\u2019s has adequate human resources \nin  place,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of  project  implementation  progress  through  ADB  review \nmissions. \n \n32.  The consultant selection process and implementation of the consulting services may \nexperience delay. These risks will be mitigated by (i) MOT ensuring timely government approval \nto proceed with advance action, (ii) Cuu Long CIPM providing adequate staff resources to carry \nout the consultant selection in accordance with the agreed time schedule, and (iii) Cuu Long \nCIPM taking strong ownership and working together with the consultants to ensure effective and \ntimely implementation of the project. Furthermore, ADB will carry out several review missions to \nmonitor the project\u2019s progress. The government\u2019s overall approval processes are also potential \ncause for delay. Cuu Long CIPM has consulted HCMC, Binh Duong and Dong Nai provinces \nand confirmed the final alignment of the Tan Van\u2013Nhon Trach section of RR3 and the extension \nroad  to  National  Highway  1,  which  provides  the  necessary  readiness  to  proceed  with  the \nproject.  \n \n33.  The government\u2019s approval of the overall feasibility study and the detailed design for the \nabove mentioned sections will be subject to confirmation of all financing sources, which may \ncause delays to the processing and implementation of the RR3 investment project. To mitigate \nthis risk, the government\u2019s early coordination with potential financiers and prompt confirmation \nof financing availability is needed. Furthermore, because the future RR3 will be fully funded and \noperated by various entities, including Cuu Long CIPM and private investors, collaboration \nbetween these entities and related local governments is critical, and must be ensured and \nmaintained throughout the preparation, implementation, and operation and maintenance stages. \nMOT therefore needs to develop and obtain mutual agreement from the provinces or cities \ninvolved in each phase of the project regarding the scope and accountability for implementation \nand operation and maintenance prior to commencing RR3 implementation.  \n \n34.  In addition to the above described risks some concerns on governance in terms of \nintegrity violations and corruption exists. However, since the project only includes recruitment of \nconsulting services the governance risk is not considered significant. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 Overall, \nthe benefits and positive impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n35.  The government, MOT, and Cuu Long CIPM have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \n                                                 \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10   \n \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36.  The  government,  MOT,  and  Cuu  Long  CIPM  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR8,475,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi \nMinh City Third Ring Road Technical Assistance Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for \na term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n30 January 2015  ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced construction  Funding for the RR3  Project progress   Adequate cofinancing and \nof  the  HCMC  RR3,  secured from various  reports to be prepared  private sector investment \ncontributing to reduced  sources secured by  by Cuu Long CIPM  are committed and \ntraffic  congestion  in  2017    materialize.  \nand  improved  (Baseline data: as per     \nconnectivity  of  HCMC  ADB COBP, 2015- Annual operational  Cuu Long CIPM has \nwith surrounding cities  2017, $287 million from  plan of Cuu Long  adequate capacity to \nand towns.
