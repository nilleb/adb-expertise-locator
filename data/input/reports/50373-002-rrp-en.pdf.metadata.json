Sri  Lanka\u2019s  energy  sector  has  achieved \nsteady progress in 1990\u20132016. The national electrification rate has increased from 29.0% in 1990 \nto 99.3% in 2016.3 However, thermal power generation accounts for 67.2% compared with 24.6% \nof  hydro  power  and  about  8.2%  of  nonconventional  renewable  energy  generation  in  the  total \ngeneration  mix.4 This  creates  a  high  expenditure  on  fuel  imports,  undermining  the  balance  of \npayments  position,  and  affects  the  environment  and  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  commitments  to  the  global \nclimate  agenda.  A  key  government  development  priority  is  to  diversify  the  existing  energy \ngeneration mix to include more indigenous, renewable energy resources.5 Sri Lanka\u2019s nationally \ndetermined  contributions  target  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  against  the  business-as-\nusual scenario (base year 2013) by 20% (4% unconditional and 16% conditional) in the energy \nsector through renewable energy development and energy efficiency improvement.6  \n \n4. \nRooftop  solar  photovoltaic  market.  Sri  Lanka  has  substantial  solar  energy  potential. \nSituated close to the equator, it has abundant sunlight year round. For over two-thirds of the land \nmass, solar radiation is in the range of 4.0\u20134.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter per day, \nwhich  is  considered  high.7 However,  the  development  of  a  solar  power  generation market  has \nbeen limited in the past. Buruthakanda Solar Park is the only utility-scale solar park, and has a \ngeneration  capacity  of  about  1.2  megawatts  (MW)  that  is  operational.  The  other  existing  solar \npower generation facilities are rooftop based. As of November 2016, there were 4,200 customers \nwith net-metered renewable energy facilities, adding up to a cumulative generating capacity of \nabout 30 MW.8 Almost all of these facilities are solar photovoltaic installations on rooftops, except \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  This lending proposal is included in the 2017 program of ADB. 2017.

In September 2016, the government announced the \nBattle  for  Solar  Energy  program. 10  The  government\u2019s  strategic  goal  is  to  increase  solar \nphotovoltaic  capacity  to  200  MW  by  2020  and  1,000  MW  by  2025.  The  program  envisages \nboosting clean  power generation  through  net metering,  net  accounting,  and micro  solar  power \nproducer (net plus) schemes to connect rooftop photovoltaic installations to the network. These \ndifferent models are described as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nNet  metering.  Introduced  in  2008,  this  model  allows  customers  to  offset  the \nconsumed  electricity  with  the  electricity  they  generate  from  their  rooftop  solar \nphotovoltaic  systems  that  is  advantageous  for  residential  customers  with  high \nconsumption. At the end of monthly billing cycles, if the customers consume more \nthan they have generated from their rooftop solar systems, they are billed at the \nelectricity  tariff  rates  based  on  their  net  consumption  level.  If  the  customers \ngenerate  more  electricity  than  they  consume,  the  electricity  surplus  balance  is \ncarried over to the next month. The surplus balances can be kept for up to 10 years \nand distribution utilities will not pay customers for any generated surplus electricity; \nNet  accounting. Introduced  in 2016,  this  model allows  customers  to  be paid in \ncash for any surplus they generate at the end of their monthly billing cycles at the \nfollowing rates: (a) year 1 to year 7 at SLRs22.0/kWh, and (b) year 8 to year 20 at \nSLRs15.5/kWh. The advantage to a customer depends on its consumption level; \nNet plus. Unlike the other two models, this allows customers to separate electricity \nconsumption and electricity generation. The customers pay for the electricity they \nconsume based on the existing tariff structure. At the same time, the customers \ncan also sell whatever electricity they generate from their rooftop solar photovoltaic \nsystems  at  the  following  rates:  (a)  year  1  to  year  7  at  SLRs22.0/kWh,  and                \n(b) year 8 to year 20 at SLRs15.5/kWh. This scheme may be advantageous for \ncommercial customers with big roof spaces. The scheme was introduced in 2016.  \n\n \n5. \nDemand analysis. The project is built upon a strong government commitment to create a \nconducive business environment to enable rooftop solar system financing, including development \nof  dedicated  financing  schemes,  introduction  of  bankable  business  models,  and  duty  and  tax \nexemptions  on  solar  panels  and  invertors.  Under  the  net  metering  scheme,  the  rooftop  solar \npower  generation  capacity  increased  from  0.7  MW  to  60.0  MW  from  2012  to  2016.  With  the \nintroduction of the net accounting and net plus models in 2016, the rooftop solar market is poised \nfor further expansion. Based on the financial viability of the three rooftop solar financing models, \nthe  market  has  a  strong  potential  to  absorb  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  funds  over  the           \n4\u2013year implementation period.11 A preliminary indicative subproject pipeline from the PFIs points \nto  a  demand  for  approximately  $20  million.  A  list  of  the  subprojects  is  provided  in  a  detailed \ndemand analysis, which also ascertains the sufficient market size under the available financing \nmodels based on current tariff structure at various lending rates.12 Market infrastructure is sound. \nFrom the suppliers\u2019 side, there are about 200 private sector renewable energy service companies \nwith a track record to provide rooftop solar systems installation and maintenance. \n \n6. \n                                                \n9  No net metered wind or other forms of renewable-energy-based power generating facilities have been reported. \n10 Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Power  and  Renewable  Energy.  2016.  Battle  for  Solar  Energy  begins  from \n\nBanking sector.

However,  market  liquidity  is  tightening  and  interest  rates  are  high. \nAverage  weighted  deposit  rates  rose  from  5.9%  in  January  2015  to  9.2%  in  July  2017. 13 \nCombined  with  perceived  higher  commercial  risk  in  the  nascent  rooftop  solar  industry  with \nuntested business models (e.g., net accounting and net plus), bank lending is limited. Thus, it is \nessential  for  the  banks  to  provide  the  funds  at  viable  terms  and  conditions  to  facilitate \ndevelopment while not distorting the market. A detailed analysis of the banking sector is in the \nfinancial  analysis  (footnote  11).  ADB  identified  10  potential  participating  financial  institutions \n(PFIs)  based  on  upfront  financial  soundness  criteria,  relevant  institutional  experience,  and/or \npotential subproject pipeline.  \n \n7. \nProject.  The  project  will  provide  long-term  debt  financing  for  the  installation  of  rooftop \nsolar photovoltaic power generation systems. The loan will be provided through the Ministry of \nFinance  and  Mass  Media  (MOFMM)  to  PFIs,  including  public  and  private  sector  banks,  for \nfinancing qualified rooftop solar systems based on the available business models. TA associated \nwith the project (see para. 23) will support (i) establishing technical guidelines and standards for \nrooftop  solar  systems;  (ii)  subproject  screening,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  compliance \nactivities; and (iii) stakeholder capacity and market development.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  that \nprioritizes assistance to renewable energy development.14 It builds on previous ADB interventions \nfocused on supporting transmission and distribution investments to expand access to clean and \nreliable electricity.15 The project considers lessons relating to grid integration of renewable energy \nand from a similar rooftop solar financial intermediation loan, reflecting improved implementation \narrangements  and  project  design.16 Being  a  financial  intermediation  loan,  the  project  will  not \ncrowd out similar private sector commercial finance because substantial government support and \nsubsidy  (e.g.,  feed-in  tariff  and  system  of  import  duty  exemption)  are  still  required  to  quickly \nexpand the rooftop solar system finance and installations.17 \n\n                                                \n13 Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Manila. \n\n17  Factual  evidences  from  a  number  of  countries  have  demonstrated  that  the  cost  of  rooftop  solar  energy  is  not \ncommercially viable during the initial rollout stage without significant public sector support. Germany, India, Japan, \nand  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  used  significant  government  subsidies  to  develop  rooftop  solar  generation.  The \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutput 1: Debt funding for rooftop solar power generation increased. This includes \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will enable ADB to help the government \n9. \nestablish a lending facility to support rooftop solar financing. ADB has extensive technical and \nfinancial expertise in renewable energy development in South Asia, including from a $500 million \nproject in India to support a similar rooftop solar financing in 2016 (footnote 16). ADB\u2019s knowledge \nand  experience  will  bring  international  best  practices  to  the  PFIs  and  help  Sri  Lanka  develop \ninnovative  renewable  energy  solutions.  This  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  program  of \nincreasing clean power generation from solar energy, particularly the rooftop solar targets of 200 \nMW  by  2020  and  1,000  MW  by  2025.  The  project  will  help  mainstream  renewable  energy \ndevelopment, increase the generation capacity for clean power, and improve the environmental \nconditions in the country. 18 It will increase the clean power generation capacity by 50 MW, which \nwill result in about 72,300 megawatt-hours of energy generation per year, equivalent to avoiding \nabout 55,600 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: access to clean and reliable power supply \nin Sri Lanka increased by 2025 (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcome: clean \npower generation enhanced.19 \n \nC. \n \n11. \nfinancing of rooftop solar subprojects equivalent to additional capacity of 50 MW.  \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Rooftop  solar  market  infrastructure  and  bankable  subproject  pipeline \ndeveloped.  This  includes  (i)  selection  of  PFIs  for  handling  debt  funding  of  commercial  and \ndomestic sector rooftop solar systems; (ii) development of a pipeline of bankable subprojects for \ntotal capacity of 50 MW; and (iii) establishment of project technical guidelines and standards to \nbe followed by borrowers, vendors, and accredited engineers.  \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  and  awareness  of  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Mass Media, participating financial institutions, and commercial and domestic \nsector customers increased. This includes (i) capacity training and workshops for the MOFMM, \nPFIs, and developers to improve knowledge on rooftop solar systems; (ii) awareness campaigns \nfor stakeholders and potential customers; and (iii) establishing and maintaining a comprehensive \ndatabase of all installations.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period \nof 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.20 Based on the straight-line repayment \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n\nsame holds true for Sri Lanka.

The subsidiary loans\u2019 terms and \nconditions to PFIs, subject to ADB concurrence, will be based on the government\u2019s cost of ADB \nfunds  and  reflect  the  commercial  market  conditions  to  develop  the  rooftop  solar  photovoltaic \nsystems  in  Sri  Lanka.  ADB  and  the  MOFMM  will  ensure  that  the  selected  PFIs  meet  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  implementation  capacity.  The  debt  funding  (through  a  credit  line)  to finance \nrooftop solar facilities could be used on a revolving basis, at the government\u2019s discretion, following \nthe ADB loan closure, but maintaining the same project compliance requirements.  \n \n19. \nThe  MOFMM  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  in  the  Development  Finance \nDepartment that will include experienced staff and will be headed by a senior officer to administer \nthe  credit  line.  The  Sri  Lanka  Sustainable  Energy  Authority  will  establish  a  suitable  project \nimplementation unit, staffed with consultants funded under the ADB TA, to handle technical and \nimplementation matters (see para. 23). The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity \nCompany Limited (LECO), the only two utilities in Sri Lanka, will support project implementation \nby  providing  technical  recommendations  to  the  PFIs  regarding  technical  proposals  of  the \napplicants, including review and approval of applications for connection of rooftop solar systems \nto the distribution network and confirming quality of generated power.  \n \n20.  Maximum  ADB financing. ADB does not impose any maximum subproject or subloan \nlimits but any rooftop solar subloan application from a PFI for the financing of a subproject with a \npower generation capacity above 1 MW will be brought for consideration of the steering committee \nestablished under the project. ADB funds can be used to finance up to 100% of the total subproject \ncost for residential rooftop solar subprojects.23 For commercial-scale rooftop solar systems with a \ntotal subproject cost of $50,000 and more, an appropriate equity contribution from the sponsor is \nrequired, to be set at a level that is commensurate with the risks of the particular subproject. The \nADB  loan will  be  disbursed  consistent  with the expenditure  limits  stated  in the  subsidiary  loan \nagreements with the PFIs. \n \n\n                                                \n23 The nature of the residential rooftop solar system financing is similar to those of a consumer loan, with a total cost \nless than the equivalent of $10,000. Therefore, equity contribution is generally not required, but this is at PFIs\u2019 own \ndiscretion.  \n\n \n\n\fFree  limit.  ADB  will  review  at  least  the  first  three  subprojects  submitted  by  each  PFI, \n21. \nregardless of the subproject size, or until ADB is satisfied with that PFI\u2019s ability to manage the \nsubproject review and disbursement process. Following ADB\u2019s satisfactory approval of  the first \nthree subprojects, ADB may permit a $50,000 free limit per subloan, under which amount no prior \nADB approval of the subproject is required. ADB reserves the rights to request any supporting \nsubproject documents and not to reimburse or liquidate any subprojects that do not comply with \nthe ADB project implementation requirements. \n \nEligibility criteria. ADB funds will be used to finance all types of rooftop solar subprojects \n22. \nthat  are  financially  sound  and  comply  with  the  subproject  eligibility  criteria  and  approval \nprocedures as outlined in the PAM.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n23. \nCredit line implementation and monitoring will be supported by the attached TA. The TA \nis estimated to cost $1.0 million to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  address \ntechnical and implementation matters through (i) establishing technical guidelines and standards \nto be followed by borrowers, vendors, and accredited engineers; (ii) assisting in the development \nof  a  viable  subproject  pipeline  to  catalyze  market  demand for  funds;  (iii)  supporting  credit  line \nimplementation  review,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  (iv)  conducting  capacity  building  and \nawareness training and workshops for stakeholders. With close coordination with the MOFMM, \nthe  Ministry  of  Power  and  Renewable  Energy  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Sri  Lanka \nSustainable  Energy  Authority  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  TA.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over the period of 2 years from November 2017 to October 2019. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \n24. \nADB  conducted  detailed  due  diligence  on  (i)  confirmation  of  existing  power  system \ninfrastructure readiness to handle the potentially rapid solar energy expansion; (ii) confirmation of \ngeneral market readiness, including available policy and regulatory support, and assessment of \nany potential financial impact on the CEB and LECO; (iii) validation of financing models (para. 4) \nto ensure market demand; and (iv) reviews of project implementation capacity including that of \nthe general finance sector and PFIs.  \n \nA. \n \n25. \nTechnical studies for the proposed outputs were conducted by consultants engaged under \nthe project preparatory TA financed by ADB in coordination with the CEB and LECO. Although \nthe  technical  viability  of  rooftop  solar  systems  has  been  well-established  throughout  the  world \nover the past 20 years, system readiness continues to be a concern.24 ADB reviewed and found \nthe  technical  studies  generally  acceptable.  The  work  undertaken  indicates  that  the  proposed \ntechnical solutions are feasible and execution arrangements are satisfactory. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nAn  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  and  its  expected  economic \nperformance was undertaken through  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  by  comparing  with-  and without-\n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n24  For example, because of periodic load shedding, inverters must be capable of disconnecting from the grid in case of \n\ngrid failure, while still being able to operate and provide solar energy for captive use. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nproject scenarios using ADB guidelines for economic analysis. The main economic benefits are \navoided  fuel  cost  from  replacement  of  conventional  thermal  generation  and  reduced  carbon \ndioxide emission. The economic internal rate of return of the project was estimated at 17%, above \nthe assumed economic hurdle rate of 9%. The capacity and financial performance of the selected \nPFIs are sound in terms of capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \nmarket  risks.25 Economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  on  a  set  of  illustrative  sample \nsubprojects based on the three rooftop solar power business models are viable.26  \n \nC. \n \n27. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  on  the \nMOFMM and 10 PFIs in accordance with the ADB Guidelines for the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects (footnote 25) and Financial Management Assessment Technical Guidance \nNote.27 The selection of the PFIs was mainly based on their institutional standing, existing rooftop \nsolar lending volume, and/or established relationship with ADB through the ADB Private Sector \nOperations  Department\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program 28  and  ADB\u2019s  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Line of Credit Project.29 Other PFIs could be added during the loan implementation, \nsubject  to  the  government\u2019s  request  and  the  established  ADB  review  process.  The  overall \nfinancial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  assessed  moderate.  The  PFIs  are  well  regulated. \nStringent project review, monitoring, and reporting requirements have been established to ensure \ncompliance. The funds available to the PFIs will be allocated efficiently to maximize project impact \n(footnote 22). Candidate PFIs\u2019 basic financial strength has been assessed separately in a capital \nadequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity (CAELS) assessment and is provided \nin  the  linked  document.30 The  CEB  and  LECO  could  potentially  be  negatively  affected  by  the \nrooftop solar power development over time, and this $50 million pilot project is critically important \nto help the government understand such an impact and explore future regulatory adjustments. \nThe potential financial impact of expanding rooftop solar schemes on these power utilities was \nassessed, and relevant covenants are included in the draft loan agreement.31 \n \n28. \nProcurement. The  MOFMM  will  monitor  and  cause  the  PFIs to monitor the  subproject \nprocurement by following ADB\u2019s procurement requirements applicable to financial intermediation \nloans. All procurement to be financed under the project will follow stated eligibility criteria. ADB \nencourages  the  MOFMM  to  require  the  PFIs  and  sub-borrowers  to  adopt  internationally \ncompetitive bidding procedures to the extent possible when the amount of the investment is large \nand economy and efficiency can be gained through such procedures. For procurement of goods \nand services to be financed by subloans, the MOFMM will require the PFIs to ensure that prices \nare reasonable and relevant factors\u2014time of delivery, efficiency, reliability, and suitability for the \nsubproject\u2014are taken into account. \n \n29. \nAnticorruption  policy.

They will be incorporated in the subsidiary \nloan agreements. The MOFMM will ensure that the PFIs follow ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.  \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe project supports solar energy development in Sri Lanka. The benefits of rooftop solar \nenergy  capacity  additions  include  national  benefits  in  terms  of  enhanced  energy  security  and \nadditional electricity supply, contributing to inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic \ngrowth, and localized benefits of improvement of livelihoods and job creation at  the subproject \nsites. The poverty reduction impact of renewable energy projects can be both direct and indirect. \nThe direct impact is through additional power generation, which supports economic activities and \nimproves the livelihoods of individuals, such as the provision of lighting, refrigeration, and other \nhousehold amenities. Indirectly, rooftop solar energy projects minimize negative environmental \nimpacts and improve the health conditions of the general public.  \n \n31. \nThe project incorporates some gender elements. ADB will conduct awareness campaigns \nincluding workshops for sector customers on a subloan application process and technical aspects \nof  solar  panel  installations and  operations. These  workshops  will  target at  least  30%  women\u2019s \nparticipation. The draft loan agreement includes provisions on following the principles of gender \nequality to increase project benefits and impacts on women during project implementation.   \n \nE. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n33. \nEnvironment (category FI treated as C). All project installations are limited to rooftops, \nand no subprojects with new grid connections that require right-of-way will be financed. Rooftop \nsolar projects do not require an environmental clearance in Sri Lanka. After they reach the end of \ntheir economic life, the solar panel modules will be treated and disposed of in accordance with \nSri Lankan laws, guidelines, and regulations. As per the occupational, safety, and health act and \nthe  regulation  for  the  disposal  of  hazardous  waste,  health  and  safety  issues  will  be  properly \naddressed and electronic wastes will be collected, treated, or disposed of by certified licensees \nfrom the Central Environment Authority.  \n \n34. \nrequire land space and have no impact on involuntary resettlement. \n \n35. \nrequire land space and have no impact on indigenous peoples. \n \nThe environmental and social impacts associated with the implementation of rooftop solar \n36. \nprojects, either commercial scale or residential scale, are negligible. Therefore, an environment \nand  social  safeguard  management  system  is  not  required,  and  an  environmental  assessment \nreview  framework  is  not  required  because  of  the  uniform  nature  of  the  work  carried  out  on  a \ncountry-wide basis. However, a safeguards checklist has been developed for subproject selection \nover the power generation capacity of 1 MW that will be screened based on the checklist to ensure \nthat subprojects financed by the credit line have minimal or no adverse environmental, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  The  screening  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB  TA \nconsultants who will provide necessary capacity building trainings to stakeholders including PFIs. \n \n37. \nlow climate change risk. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  FI  treated  as  C).
