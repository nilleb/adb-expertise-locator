The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSupporting the Financial Market Development Program, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  program  supports  key  policy  reforms  designed  to  address  identified  deficiencies, \nvulnerabilities,  and  inadequate  inclusiveness  in the finance  sector,  while  drawing  lessons from \nprevious programs of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The program aims to strengthen the \nfinance sector\u2019s resource mobilization to improve its allocative efficiency and to enhance stability \nand inclusiveness at the request of the Government of Bhutan. The program is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for commitment in 2019.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nDevelopment problem. There are several emerging priorities facing the government after \n3. \n3  decades  of  rapid  economic  growth\u2014which  averaged  7.0%  from  fiscal  year  (FY)  1998  to \nFY2018\u2014and  a  reduction  in  the  national  poverty  rate  from  23.0%  in  2007  to  8.2%  in  2017. \nHydropower  has  been  the  main  driver  of  economic  growth,  contributing  about  25.0%  to  gross \ndomestic  product  annually.  However,  the  capital-intensive  nature  of  hydropower  has  restricted \nthe  industry\u2019s  ability  to  create  adequate  employment  opportunities  for  the  growing  youth \npopulation entering the labor market. Therefore, the government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u2013\n2023  aims  to  diversify  the  economy  by  creating  jobs  and  promoting  the  private  sector.3 The \nrelatively small private sector is comprised mainly of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \nInadequate  access  to  finance  and  the  high  cost  of  obtaining  credit  are  among  the  principal \nconstraints to private sector development.4 \n \nAs Bhutan is set to graduate from the United Nations list of least-developed countries in \n4. \n2023,  the  country  consequently  will  have  less  access  to  concessionary  resources.  Currently, \ndomestic  savings  finances  only  66%  of  the  annual  budget.  The  government  finances  the \nremaining  34%  through  external  loans  and  official  development  assistance.  Therefore,  the \ngovernment will need to mobilize greater domestic resources by promoting private savings and \ninvestments to compensate for its diminishing access to concessionary resources. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2018.

Investment Climate Assessment of Bhutan: Removing Constraints to Private Sector Development \n\nto Enable the Creation of More and Better Jobs.  Washington, DC. \n\n\fBinding constraints. The government recognizes that the finance sector plays a critical \n5. \nrole in mobilizing domestic resources to meet development needs. Concurrently, the government \nhas  resolved  to  allocate  sufficient resources to promote  private  sector development  efficiently. \nThere  are  three  key  binding  constraints  on  the  finance  sector:  (i)  underdeveloped  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions,  (ii)  deficient  financial  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  the  combined  effects  of  low \nfinancial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. \n \n6. \nUnderdeveloped  nonbank  financial  institutions.  The  banking  sector  dominates \nBhutan\u2019s financial system. It provided 87% of total finance sector assets as of December 2018. \nThe  banking sector\u2019s  deposit  base  is  predominantly  short term,  but  its  loans  are typically  long \nterm. This creates maturity mismatches and a liquidity risk, which were among the major causes \nof the Asian financial crisis. Inadequate long-term sources of finance and, consequently, limited \nlong-term investments restrict the development of the finance sector. The capital market, including \nthe government debt market, remains shallow. There is no long-term domestic government bond, \nand the corporate bond market is highly illiquid. The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB) \nhas registered total outstanding corporate bonds worth Nu8.76 billion (about $123 million) against \n17 bonds listed on the RSEB. In 2018, companies in Bhutan issued four commercial papers worth \nNu3.75 billion (about $53 million). As of April 2019, the total market capitalization on the RSEB \nstood  at  Nu44.71  billion  (about  $627 million),  with  21  listed  companies  and  6  brokerage firms. \nCurrently,  such  investors  as  the  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund  (NPPF)  and  insurance \ncompanies concentrate their investments in a very limited class of assets. The government has \nyet  to  establish risk-based  rules  and regulations  to  supervise  the solvency  of  insurers  and the \nsustainability of pensions. In addition, financial institutions in Bhutan are unable to meet domestic \nhousing finance demands. In response to a surge in demand for housing, especially around the \nsuburbs of Bhutan\u2019s largest cities\u2014Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Paro\u2014banks had been lending \nheavily for housing before the Indian rupee crisis of 2012.5 Housing loans then comprised 25% of \ntotal finance sector credit and posed a risk of overconcentration. Because banks generally provide \n20-year fixed-rate housing loans, they are vulnerable to a rise in interest rates.6 According to the \nBhutan  Living  Standards  Survey  Report  2017,  middle-income  and  lower-income  urban \nhouseholds spend an estimated 40%\u201260% of their disposable income on rent because of lack of \naffordable housing.7 \n \nDeficient financial infrastructure. Bhutan\u2019s financial system is potentially vulnerable to \n7. \nrapid changes in the global financial landscape. In its 2016 mutual evaluation report on Bhutan, \nthe Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) rated the country\u2019s effectiveness low both for \nthe regulator, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), and for financial institutions\u2019 compliance with \nanti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements.8 The report \nalso rated Bhutan noncompliant with technical assessment of risks and in applying a risk-based \napproach because Bhutan continues to use compliance-based bank supervision. Nonperforming \n\n                                                \n5  The crisis revolved around a shortage of Indian rupees in Bhutan, which forced the government to sell part of its US \ndollars of foreign exchange reserves and clamp down on housing loans (most building materials are imported from \nIndia) and personal loans (to import motor vehicles). \n\n6  R.

The  APG  is  an  autonomous  and  collaborative  international  organization  founded  in  1997  in  Bangkok, \nThailand  consisting  of  41  members  and  a  number  of  international  and  regional  observers.  Some  of  the  key \ninternational organizations who participate with, and support, the efforts of the APG in the region include ADB, the \nEgmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, the Financial Action Task Force, the International Monetary Fund, the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and the \nWorld Bank. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\floans (NPLs) have been increasing. Under the Prudential Regulations 2017,9 the maximum NPL \nratio is 5.0%. In Bhutan, banks and nonbanks recorded an NPL ratio of 16.0% as of March 2019. \nMoreover,  because  of  insufficient  oversight  and  monitoring,  there  have  been  reported  among \nfinancial  institutions  several  cases  of  fraud  that  involved  both  genuine  and  fake  customer \naccounts.  As  banks  continue  to  digitalize,  they  face  unprecedented  challenges  involving \ncybersecurity.10 In collaboration with the World Bank, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre \nof the University of Oxford has facilitated a self-assessment of cybersecurity capacity in Bhutan. \nWhile  Bhutan may  not  be threatened  by  direct,  systemic cyberattacks,  increasing  digitalization \nleaves  it  open  to  risk.  The  country  also  lacks  a  data  backup  and  recovery  infrastructure  for \nbusiness continuity planning.11 \n \n8. \nLow financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector has \nbeen growing rapidly. The ratio of private sector credit to gross domestic product increased from \n15.4% in 2005 to 50.6% in 2018. However, the expansion of private credit has not benefited the \npopulation  evenly.  In  rural  areas,  demand  for  less  complex  and  less  time-consuming  banking \nservices  is  substantially  unmet.  Because  of  their  limited  exposure  to  economic  opportunities, \nwomen encounter less-favorable conditions for accessing finance than do men. As of December \n2017, among the 64.5% of adults in Bhutan who held savings accounts, 56.0% were men while \nonly 44.0% were women. Only 16.1% of adults had access to credit, of which 64.0% were men \nand 36.0% were women. Similarly, of the 17.0% of adults owning insurance, 59.0% were men \nand  41.0%  were  women. 12  This  is  partly  because  banks  still  assess  loan  requests  against \ncollateral, rather than in consideration of a project\u2019s financial viability. On the other hand, banks \nface limited access to credit information, high costs of servicing distant locations, and weaknesses \nin restructuring and insolvency rules. On the deposit side, the small and irregular savings of the \nrural population coupled with poor access to banks mean that many people prefer to keep their \nsavings  as  ready  cash.  Inadequate  knowledge  about  insurance  products  impedes  their  utility. \nMany rural communities lack access to formal remittance services.13 Therefore, the benefits of \nmodern electronic and online payment systems have yet to reach all, and cash still dominates the \npayment system.14 \n \n9. \nFinancial  inclusion  has  been  improving  because  of  the  establishment  of  microfinance \ninstitutions, the introduction of digital services, the use of bank agents, the introduction of priority \nsector lending and financial literacy programs, and the imposition of the minimum lending rate in \n2016.  However,  financial  inclusion  remains  inadequate  because  of  limited  access  to  finance. \nMoreover, there is no consumer protection in Bhutan. Rural borrowers rarely have any means of \nrecourse if bank staff act improperly, and attentiveness to customer service appears to be lacking. \nCustomers  of  financial  institutions  in  Bhutan  are  poorly  informed  about  their  rights  and \nresponsibilities.  There  is  no  convenient  mechanism  for  dispute  resolution.  During  focus  group \ndiscussions, some respondents reported that they had trouble resolving discrepancies between \n\n                                                \n9 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2017.

Since then, this response team \nhas handled and resolved about 250 computer incidents, of which about 83% were vulnerabilities found in systems, \nand  about  10%  systems  infected  by  malicious  codes.  The  remaining  6%  were  phishing  emails  and  sites, \ncompromised systems, and intrusion attempts. There are also cases that were not reported or detected. \n\n11 As per the current seismic map of the country, provided by the Department of Geology and Mines, the best location \nfor a disaster recovery site is Bumthang. Alternate geographical locations for backup outside Bhutan may also be \nconsidered, but this may be complex since it would involve issues relating to cross-border data and sovereignty. \n\n12 Government of Bhutan, RMA. 2018.

The  program  will  support  the  government  in  its \ncommitment  to  continue  reforms  to  make  the  finance  sector  more  responsive  to  emerging \npriorities,  while  remaining  stable  and  inclusive.  This  support  is  critical  for  the  government  to \nachieve  national  key  result  areas  of  the  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023,  such  as \nmacroeconomic  stability,  economic  diversification,  and  poverty  reduction  (footnote  3).  The \ngovernment has already prepared several long-term sector development strategies. In 2014, the \nRMA  formulated  the  Capital  Market  Master  Plan  for  Bhutan,  2014\u20132024,  which  provides \nadditional financial intermediation sources, including microfinance intermediaries that can serve \nas alternatives to commercial banks, on which Bhutan had previously depended.15 In 2017, the \ngovernment approved the Financial Sector Development Action Plan, which details reform actions \nthat  affect,  among  others,  the  banking  system,  nonbank  financial  institutions,  and  financial \ninclusion and financial literacy.16 Since 2017, the RMA has established several payment system \ninfrastructures through regulatory reforms and system automation. In July 2019, the government \nlaunched the e-commerce guidelines and platform, and revised its foreign direct investment policy \nand cottage and small industry policy. The RMA adopted Macro Prudential Regulations in 2018. \nIn  2019,  the  RMA  issued  risk  management  guidelines  to  provide  minimum  standards  for  risk \nmanagement practices and to encourage financial institutions to adopt and implement a sound \nrisk management framework. The RMA also approved the establishment of the Rural Enterprise \nDevelopment  Corporation  Limited,  which  will  be  the  first  cottage  and  small  industry  bank  to \noperate in Bhutan. It will be a specialized bank that will service the financing needs of cottage and \nsmall industries. \n \n11. \nPolicy reforms. The proposed program modality is a programmatic approach. It consists \nof  two  subprograms  that  are  designed  to  allow  ADB  to  remain  engaged  and  to  help  the \ngovernment implement increasingly complex long-term finance sector reforms. Each subprogram \nis  a  single  tranche  intervention.  To  supplement  these,  there  is  a  post-program  engagement \nframework that will guide the design of the reforms under a third subprogram. There are 9 policy \nactions under subprogram 1, and 13 policy actions under subprogram 2. These policy actions are \ndesigned to achieve three reform areas: (i) nonbank financial system developed, (ii) stability and \nintegrity  of  the  financial  system  strengthened,  and  (iii)  financial  inclusion  promoted.  These  are \npresented in detail in the government\u2019s Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) and the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n12. \nReform area 1: Nonbank financial system developed. This reform area is designed to \ndevelop  medium-term  and  long-term  debt  instruments  and  to  deepen  the  nonbank  financial \nsystem.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  approved  both  a  long-term \ngovernment bond issuance strategy and an implementation plan. Under subprogram 2, the MOF \nwill  develop  rules  and  regulations  for  government  bond  issuance.  The  government  has \nestablished a committee to assess its present rules on issuing corporate bonds and commercial \npapers to help develop the domestic bond market.17 Introducing long-term debt instruments with \nan  established  yield  curve  will  establish  a  much-needed  benchmark  rate  for  long-dated \n                                                \n15 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority.

That  policy \ncreates sustainable and inclusive pension and provident fund schemes by expanding membership \ncoverage to include private sector and self-employed individuals, consequently benefiting women \nwho  constitute  61%  of  self-employed  individuals.18 Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will \napprove (i) a strategy for the expansion of coverage to these excluded groups, and (ii) rules and \nregulations for implementing the NPPF policy. In parallel under subprogram 1, the RMA issued a \ndirective  to  assess  the  solvency  of  insurance  companies  based  on  how  they  comply  with \nprudential  regulations.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  plans  to  amend  the  Financial \nServices Act to allow insurance companies to introduce more insurance products, and thereby \ndiversify  their  portfolios  and  minimize  risks.  With  respect  to  housing  finance,  the  government \ndrafted  a  National  Human  Settlement  Policy  in  2015  and  conducted  a  housing  finance \nconsultation in 2016. Consequently, ADB completed a feasibility study for housing finance reform \nin February 2018. Under subprogram 1, the government used ADB\u2019s feasibility study in drafting \nits  National  Housing  Policy,  which  emphasizes  housing  affordability,  and  which  helps \ndisadvantaged  groups,  including  women,  to  access  housing  finance.  Subsequently,  under \nsubprogram 2, the government will establish a detailed strategy that will define fiscal measures \nand incentives, and that will identify the housing finance mechanisms to be used. Over the long \nterm,  this  will  help  the  government  establish  a  housing  finance  entity  as  a  nonbank  financial \ninstitution.19 \n \n13. \nReform  area  2:  Stability  and  integrity  of  the  financial  system  strengthened.  This \nreform area is designed to strengthen the banking and financial infrastructure and to provide for \neffective  supervision.  To  achieve  this,  the  RMA  has  instituted  risk-based  bank  supervision, \nincluding  stress  testing,  and  has  designed  templates  for  institutional  risk  profiles  and  risk \nassessment. Under subprogram 1, the RMA has begun to implement provisioning for impaired \nloans  to  comply  with  the  Bhutan  Accounting  Standards.  The  RMA  will  revise  its  Prudential \nRegulations  to  comply  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS). 20 Under \nsubprogram 1, the government enacted the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing \nof Terrorism Act 2018. The RMA approved AML/CFT Rules and Regulations 2018. These reforms \nhave improved Bhutan\u2019s technical compliance with the Recommendations of the Financial Action \nTask Force on Money Laundering, as noted in APG\u2019s follow-up report to the APG\u2019s 2016 mutual \nevaluation  report  on  Bhutan. 21 The  follow-up  report  also  upgraded  the  country\u2019s  rating  from \nnoncompliant to largely compliant in technically assessing risks and using a risk-based approach. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  RMA  will  operationalize  an  online  anti-money  laundering  reporting \nsystem. Similarly, in April 2019 under subprogram 1, the RMA issued a directive on implementing \na cybersecurity framework. Under subprogram 2, the RMA will adopt a business continuity plan \nand  a  cybersecurity  framework,  which  will  seek  to  preempt  cyber  threats  proactively. \nCybersecurity is monitored both by the Bhutan Computer Incident Response Team and by the \nRMA\u2019s Financial Institutions Cyber Response Team. Banks are implementing initiatives to comply \nwith the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certifications, \nwhich will enhance cybersecurity controls. \n\n                                                \n18 Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2019.

The entity might also issue local currency bonds, which \nwill offer investment opportunities to pension funds and insurance companies. \n\n20 The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan signed an agreement with the IFRS Foundation to adopt \nIFRS in a phased manner (phase 1 for 2013\u20132015, phase 2 for 2016\u20132017, and phase 3 for 2018\u20132019), aiming for \nfull adoption and compliance by 2021. \n\n21 APG. 2018. 2nd Follow-Up Report: Mutual Evaluation of Bhutan. Sydney. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nReform area 3: Financial inclusion promoted. This reform area is designed to promote \n14. \nfinancial  inclusion  and  to  enhance  financial  literacy  by  focusing  on  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding  the  poor,  youth,  and  women.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  RMA  approved  the  National \nFinancial  Inclusion  Strategy  (NFIS),  2018\u20132023  and  the  National  Financial  Literacy  Strategy \n(NFLS),  2018\u20132023. 22  These  strategies  seek  to  improve  the  livelihoods  of  vulnerable  and \nmarginalized segments of the population, including women and youth, by enhancing their financial \nliteracy  and  capabilities  and  by  giving  them  better  access  to financial  services.  The  RMA  also \napproved rules and regulations on consumer protection in connection with financial services to \nempower  service  users  and  to  enhance  consumer  confidence.  Financial  service  providers\u2014\ncomprising  five  banks,  three  insurance  companies,  and  six  microfinance  institutions\u2014will \nconsequently establish formal consumer grievance redressal mechanisms under subprogram 2. \nUnder subprogram 2, the RMA will expand the curriculum framework that it uses to educate both \nlocal  government  officials  and  students  in  nonformal  education  centers  and  technical  training \ninstitutes,  while  focusing  on  women.  The  TA  attached  to  the  program  will  help  the  RMA  to \nimplement the NFIS and NFLS effectively. To do so, under subprogram 2, the RMA will approve \nthe  action  plan for  the  NFIS  and the  NFLS. The action  plan  will  widen  and  intensify  access to \ncredit, especially among cottage and small industries, which comprise more than 95% of the total \nnumber of companies and employ significant numbers of women. The action plan will establish \nan  inclusive  green  finance  scheme  that  will  help  to  finance  entrepreneurs  who  invest  in \nenvironment-friendly  projects.  To  promote  access  to  credit  by  farmers,  the  government  will \nimprove commodity trading facilities and establish a warehouse receipt financing scheme that will \nenable farmers to use receipts as collateral. \n \n15, \nPost-program engagement framework. The program provides for a structured dialogue \nover 5\u201310 years on finance sector reforms between ADB, the MOF, and the RMA. Key activities \nunder  the  program  that  require  further  dialogue  to  promote  sustainability  include  (i)  the \ngovernment\u2019s issuance of domestic long-term bonds; (ii) the strategy and implementation plan for \naffordable  housing,  including  measures  to  address  women\u2019s  constraints  in  accessing  housing \nfinance; (iii) the risk profiling and assessment of all commercial banks; (iv) consumer protection; \nand  (v)  timely  implementation  of  the  NFIS  and  NFLS.  A  third  subprogram  may  be  proposed \ndepending on the positive outcome of subprograms 1 and 2. \n \nADB\u2019s experience. ADB has been a partner in Bhutan\u2019s development since 1982. The \n16. \nBhutan\u2013ADB partnership in the finance sector began in 1984 with the provision of the Industrial \nSector Study and the Establishment of a Development Financing Mechanism TA project. 23  This \nsubsequently helped the government to establish the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation, \nnow  called  Bhutan  Development  Bank  Limited.  ADB  was  also  instrumental  in  helping  to \nstrengthen the RMA\u2019s central banking role as the single regulator of banks and nonbanks under \nthe Financial Institution Act in 1992.24 This gave the RMA independence to determine monetary \npolicy. To support the RMA, ADB also helped to establish the Credit Information Bureau in 2009, \nthe Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan in 2010, and the Financial Intelligence \nUnit  for  AML/CFT  in  2011.  Subsequently,  Bhutan  has  been  continually  reforming  its  finance \nsector,  which  has  consequently  deepened  and  expanded  at  about  14%  annually  in  terms  of \nassets on average from December 2014 to December 2018. This underlines the government\u2019s \ncommitment to reform. The Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s validation report of the country \npartnership strategy final review, 2014\u20132018 noted that, throughout its operations in Bhutan, ADB \n                                                \n22 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2018.

The  program  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  policy-based \nprograms that supported finance sector reforms, such as the first and the second Strengthening \nEconomic  Management  Program,  which  helped  the  government  implement  key  reforms  to \ndevelop  the  financial  market  and  strengthen  financial  capacity.26 The  design  of  the  proposed \nprogram  is  also  based  on  achievements  and  lessons from  ongoing TA  projects.27 Many  of  the \nreform  actions  are  continuations  of  reforms  that  ADB  supported  previously.  For  example,  the \nstress testing that began under the second Strengthening Economic Management Program has \nbeen  expanded  and  intensified  under  this  program.  Financial  literacy,  also  started  under  the \nsecond Strengthening Economic Management Program, is further promoted under this program. \nBhutan has continued AML/CFT reforms since receiving its mutual evaluation report in 2016. The \nprogram  also  supports  the  RMA\u2019s  efforts  to  comply  fully  with  the  remaining  recommendations \nthrough ongoing ADB TA projects (footnote 27). Although the MOF has been issuing short-term \ntreasury bills since 2009, this program seeks to deepen the market by introducing  a long-term \nbond that extends the maturity of existing instruments. Bhutan has been complying in phases with \nIFRS standards and plans to comply fully by 2021.  \n \n18. \nThe reform actions under the program have been prepared to help the government realize \nits  current  capacity  to  improve  cybersecurity  in  Bhutan.  The  Global  Cyber  Security  Capacity \nCentre  of the  University  of Oxford  has  suggested  that  the government  should  collaborate  with \nindustry  and  civil  society  to  promote  cybersecurity  and  thereby  encourage  information  and \ncommunication  technology  development.  The  Independent  Evaluation  Department  validation \nreport  noted  that  efforts  to  diversify  the  economy  cannot  be  sustained  without  accompanying \npublic sector management and finance reforms that strengthen governance (footnote 1). \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  the  program.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  has  been  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda through a strategic framework; informed policy dialogue; evidence-\nbased studies; and sequencing and pacing of reforms, particularly in planning and coordinating \nvarious  elements  of  reforms.  ADB  also  supports  capacity  building,  including  preparation  of \nblueprints  for  specific  reform  actions,  and  the  promotion  of  ownership  among  stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector. The \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach has been implemented more effectively \nsince 2017 when ADB\u2019s Bhutan Resident Mission expanded and undertook core tasks in country \noperations.  The  greater  field  presence  and  staff  strength  have  enabled  ADB  to  be  more \nresponsive to client needs and emerging issues in coordination with ADB experts from the South \nAsia  Department  and  other  departments,  including  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCoordination Department; Office of Anticorruption and Integrity; Office of the General Counsel; \nOffice  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership;  Office  of  Risk  Management;  Procurement,  Portfolio  and \nFinancial  Management  Department;  Private  Sector  Operations  Department;  Treasury \nDepartment; and Sustainable Development and Climate Chance Department. \n \n\n                                                \n25 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Manila.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  involvement  of  development  partners  in  the \n20. \nfinance sector is well defined.28 The design of the proposed reforms is informed by a number of \nstudies  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Access  to credit  was  identified  as \none  of  the  major  critical  development  constraints  in  a  diagnostic  study  on  Bhutan  that  ADB \nprepared  with  the Government  of  Australia  and  the  Japan International Cooperation  Agency.29 \nThe government adopted its Capital Market Master Plan in 2014 following ADB TA that created, \namong  others,  a  blueprint  for  a  debt  market  strategy.30 The  World  Bank  created  the  Financial \nSector  Development  Action  Plan for  Bhutan,  which  was  approved  by the government  in  2017. \nAlso in 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) established the South Asia Regional Training \nand Technical Assistance Center for economic capacity building in New Delhi. The IMF is helping \nthe government set up a liquidity forecasting framework. This aligns with the goal of moving the \nconduct of monetary policy from direct to indirect monetary instruments. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe impact of the reform will be the improved economic welfare of the Bhutanese people, \nespecially  women,  through  increased  employment,  private  sector  business  development, \nenhanced access to finance, and greater efficiency of financial intermediation. The program will \nsupport  the  government  with  institutional  reforms  while  improving  the  technical  capacity  of \nregulatory and financial institutions. The first reform area of this program seeks to develop the \nnonbank financial  system  by  issuing  both  a  long-term government  bond  and  corporate  bonds. \nThis will increase the volume of bonds traded in the capital market. By 2023, the total value of \noutstanding bonds is expected to reach Nu9.3 billion (about $130 million), an increase of 7% from \nthe 2018 baseline. The second reform area aims to strengthen the stability of the financial system. \nThis will further increase the year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by commercial \nbanks. The program\u2019s target for this is to increase the average 2014\u20132018 baseline rate of 14.7% \nto  at  least  an  average  of  17.0%  for  2019\u20132023.  The  third  reform  area  is  to  promote  financial \ninclusion by implementing the NFIS and the NFLS. This will improve the private sector\u2019s access \nto finance. The target is for the percentage of adults who have access to credit to reach at least \n18.0% by 2023 compared with the 16.0% baseline of 2018. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe total expenditure for the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 is estimated at Nu310 \nbillion (about $4.3 billion), an increase of 38% from that of the previous 5-year plan. Of the total \nexpenditure, current expenditure accounts for 62.5%, or Nu193.90 billion (about $2.7 billion), all \nof which is financed by domestic revenue. Capital expenditure accounts for 37.5%, or Nu116.12 \nbillion (about $1.6 billion), 21% of which is financed by domestic revenue. Domestic revenue thus \nfinances roughly 70%, or Nu218.16 billion (about $3.1 billion), of total expenditure. Financing is \nrequired to fund the remaining 79% of capital expenditure. Of capital expenditure, 54% will be \nfinanced  through  grants.  The  final  25%  of  capital  expenditure  will  be  financed  by  external \nborrowings  from  multilateral  development  partners,  mainly  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  on \nhighly concessional terms. The external financing gap over the 5-year period is estimated at Nu29 \nbillion (about $406 million). \n \n23. \nThe government has requested a loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n                                                \n28 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2013.

The \nindicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital \nresources.  Bhutan  was  assessed  to  have  a  moderate  risk  in  the  2018  IMF\u2013World  Bank  debt \nsustainability assessment. The IMF assessment letter provides current assessment of Bhutan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic conditions, prospects, and policies (Appendix 2). \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe MOF is the executing agency, and the RMA and the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement  are  implementing  agencies.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the \nMOF, was established for guiding and monitoring the program implementation. The proceeds of \nthe policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The implementation period is January 2018\u2013November \n2019 for subprogram 1, and December 2019\u2013March 2022 for subprogram 2. ADB will support the \ngovernment  in  implementing the  post-program  engagement framework  to  promote  sustainable \noutcomes. All subprogram 1 policy actions were accomplished. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $525,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \n25. \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6).  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  27 \nmonths  from  December  2019  to  March  2022  to  support  financial  inclusion  activities  and  post-\nprogram  engagement  activities.  It  will  require  a  total  of  12  person-months  of  international \nconsultancy  services  and  14  person-months  of  national  consultancy  services.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged.  The  TA  will  assist  in  (i)  preparing  regulatory  frameworks  and \nbackground analyses; (ii) building the capacity of government agencies and financial institutions \nto  implement  reforms;  and  (iii)  raising  the  financial  literacy  levels  of  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding  women  and  youth.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  and  housing  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance, \ndomestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ndisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSafeguards. The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  policies  and  is  classified \n\n \n26. \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.31 \n \nPoverty  and  social.  Bhutan\u2019s  limited  financial  market  development  has  had  a \n27. \ndisproportionate  impact  on  the  poor.  Only  25%  of  adults  in  the  poorest  40%  of  households  in \nBhutan have a bank account while in other developing economies the rate is 50% based on 2014 \ndata.32 Also, as of December 2017, although 64.5% of adults in Bhutan had a savings account, \nonly 6.1% had access to credit, and 17.8% held a life insurance policy (footnote 12). Insufficient \naccess to affordable credit and other financial services, coupled with low financial literacy and a \nlack of consumer protection mechanisms, constrains the ability of the poor to improve their lives. \nReforms  under  the  program  will  help  the  government  achieve  its  poverty  reduction  target  by \n\n                                                \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n32 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2018.

The  program  also  includes  the \ndevelopment  of  lending  covenants  for  housing  and  homeownership,  and  introduction  of  risk-\nsharing arrangements to help expand access to credit. The program objectives and activities also \nalign with the goal of advancing gender equality and empowering women by improving women\u2019s \naccess to financial resources. The government will monitor the progress of how women increase \ntheir access to credit, accrue savings, obtain insurance, and receive pensions, and will report to \nADB as part of its continuing policy dialogue. \n \nGovernance. Bhutan\u2019s inherent financial management risk is considered moderate. The \n28. \n2016 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment reported improvements from the \nprevious  assessment  (2010). 33  However,  the  lowest  scores  were  given  for  accounting  and \nreporting,  government  transparency,  and  budget  reliability.  Consequently,  the  government  is \nimplementing a public finance management reform action plan that covers five reform measures, \nof which two measures have yet to be implemented: (i) integration of the civil services information \nsystem with the payroll system, and (ii) integration of the planning and monitoring system with the \nmultiyear  rolling  budget  system  and  the  public  expenditure  management  system.  In  terms  of \ncorruption, Bhutan consistently scores high on global indexes for control of corruption, ranking \n25th out of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 Corruption Perception Index. The \ndomestic  perception  of  corruption,  however,  has  been  worsening. ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n29. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n\nRisks and mitigating measures.
