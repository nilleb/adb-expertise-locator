THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Financial Market Development Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSupporting the Financial Market Development Program, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program supports key policy reforms designed to address identified deficiencies, \nvulnerabilities, and inadequate inclusiveness in the finance sector, while drawing lessons from \nprevious programs of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The program aims to strengthen the \nfinance sector\u2019s resource mobilization to improve its allocative efficiency and to enhance stability \nand inclusiveness at the request of the Government of Bhutan. The program is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for commitment in 2019.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development problem. There are several emerging priorities facing the government after \n3 decades of rapid economic growth\u2014which averaged 7.0% from fiscal year (FY) 1998 to \nFY2018\u2014and a reduction in the national poverty rate from 23.0% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2017. \nHydropower has been the main driver of economic growth, contributing about 25.0% to gross \ndomestic product annually. However, the capital-intensive nature of hydropower has restricted \nthe  industry\u2019s  ability  to  create  adequate  employment  opportunities  for  the  growing  youth \npopulation entering the labor market. Therefore, the government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u2013\n2023 aims to diversify the economy by creating jobs and promoting the private sector.3 The \nrelatively small private sector is comprised mainly of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \nInadequate access to finance and the high cost of obtaining credit are among the principal \nconstraints to private sector development.4 \n \n4.  As Bhutan is set to graduate from the United Nations list of least-developed countries in \n2023, the country consequently will have less access to concessionary resources. Currently, \ndomestic  savings  finances  only  66%  of  the  annual  budget.  The  government  finances  the \nremaining  34%  through  external  loans  and  official  development  assistance.  Therefore,  the \ngovernment will need to mobilize greater domestic resources by promoting private savings and \ninvestments to compensate for its diminishing access to concessionary resources. \n \n                                                \n1  Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.

Investment Climate Assessment of Bhutan: Removing Constraints to Private Sector Development \nto Enable the Creation of More and Better Jobs.  Washington, DC. ", "2 \n5.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes that the finance sector plays a critical \nrole in mobilizing domestic resources to meet development needs. Concurrently, the government \nhas resolved to allocate sufficient resources to promote private sector development efficiently. \nThere are three key binding constraints on the finance sector: (i) underdeveloped nonbank \nfinancial institutions, (ii) deficient financial infrastructure, and (iii) the combined effects of low \nfinancial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. \n \n6.  Underdeveloped  nonbank  financial  institutions.  The  banking  sector  dominates \nBhutan\u2019s financial system. It provided 87% of total finance sector assets as of December 2018. \nThe banking sector\u2019s deposit base is predominantly short term, but its loans are typically long \nterm. This creates maturity mismatches and a liquidity risk, which were among the major causes \nof the Asian financial crisis. Inadequate long-term sources of finance and, consequently, limited \nlong-term investments restrict the development of the finance sector. The capital market, including \nthe government debt market, remains shallow. There is no long-term domestic government bond, \nand the corporate bond market is highly illiquid. The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB) \nhas registered total outstanding corporate bonds worth Nu8.76 billion (about $123 million) against \n17 bonds listed on the RSEB. In 2018, companies in Bhutan issued four commercial papers worth \nNu3.75 billion (about $53 million). As of April 2019, the total market capitalization on the RSEB \nstood at Nu44.71 billion (about $627 million), with 21 listed companies and 6 brokerage firms. \nCurrently, such investors as the National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF) and insurance \ncompanies concentrate their investments in a very limited class of assets. The government has \nyet to establish risk-based rules and regulations to supervise the solvency of insurers and the \nsustainability of pensions. In addition, financial institutions in Bhutan are unable to meet domestic \nhousing finance demands. In response to a surge in demand for housing, especially around the \nsuburbs of Bhutan\u2019s largest cities\u2014Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Paro\u2014banks had been lending \nheavily for housing before the Indian rupee crisis of 2012.5 Housing loans then comprised 25% of \ntotal finance sector credit and posed a risk of overconcentration. Because banks generally provide \n20-year fixed-rate housing loans, they are vulnerable to a rise in interest rates.6 According to the \nBhutan  Living  Standards  Survey  Report  2017,  middle-income  and  lower-income  urban \nhouseholds spend an estimated 40%\u201260% of their disposable income on rent because of lack of \naffordable housing.7 \n \n7.  Deficient financial infrastructure. Bhutan\u2019s financial system is potentially vulnerable to \nrapid changes in the global financial landscape. In its 2016 mutual evaluation report on Bhutan, \nthe Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) rated the country\u2019s effectiveness low both for \nthe regulator, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), and for financial institutions\u2019 compliance with \nanti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements.8 The report \nalso rated Bhutan noncompliant with technical assessment of risks and in applying a risk-based \napproach because Bhutan continues to use compliance-based bank supervision. Nonperforming \n                                                \n5  The crisis revolved around a shortage of Indian rupees in Bhutan, which forced the government to sell part of its US \ndollars of foreign exchange reserves and clamp down on housing loans (most building materials are imported from \nIndia) and personal loans (to import motor vehicles). \n6  R.

The APG is an autonomous and collaborative international organization founded in 1997 in Bangkok, \nThailand consisting of 41 members and a number of international and regional observers. Some of the key \ninternational organizations who participate with, and support, the efforts of the APG in the region include ADB, the \nEgmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, the Financial Action Task Force, the International Monetary Fund, the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and the \nWorld Bank. \n ", "3 \nloans (NPLs) have been increasing. Under the Prudential Regulations 2017,9 the maximum NPL \nratio is 5.0%. In Bhutan, banks and nonbanks recorded an NPL ratio of 16.0% as of March 2019. \nMoreover, because of insufficient oversight and monitoring, there have been reported among \nfinancial  institutions  several  cases  of  fraud  that  involved  both  genuine  and  fake  customer \naccounts.  As  banks  continue  to  digitalize,  they  face  unprecedented  challenges  involving \ncybersecurity.10 In collaboration with the World Bank, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre \nof the University of Oxford has facilitated a self-assessment of cybersecurity capacity in Bhutan. \nWhile Bhutan may not be threatened by direct, systemic cyberattacks, increasing digitalization \nleaves it open to risk. The country also lacks a data backup and recovery infrastructure for \nbusiness continuity planning.11 \n \n8.  Low financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector has \nbeen growing rapidly. The ratio of private sector credit to gross domestic product increased from \n15.4% in 2005 to 50.6% in 2018. However, the expansion of private credit has not benefited the \npopulation evenly. In rural areas, demand for less complex and less time-consuming banking \nservices is substantially unmet. Because of their limited exposure to economic opportunities, \nwomen encounter less-favorable conditions for accessing finance than do men. As of December \n2017, among the 64.5% of adults in Bhutan who held savings accounts, 56.0% were men while \nonly 44.0% were women. Only 16.1% of adults had access to credit, of which 64.0% were men \nand 36.0% were women. Similarly, of the 17.0% of adults owning insurance, 59.0% were men \nand 41.0% were women.12 This is partly because banks still assess loan requests against \ncollateral, rather than in consideration of a project\u2019s financial viability. On the other hand, banks \nface limited access to credit information, high costs of servicing distant locations, and weaknesses \nin restructuring and insolvency rules. On the deposit side, the small and irregular savings of the \nrural population coupled with poor access to banks mean that many people prefer to keep their \nsavings as ready cash. Inadequate knowledge about insurance products impedes their utility. \nMany rural communities lack access to formal remittance services.13 Therefore, the benefits of \nmodern electronic and online payment systems have yet to reach all, and cash still dominates the \npayment system.14 \n \n9.  Financial inclusion has been improving because of the establishment of microfinance \ninstitutions, the introduction of digital services, the use of bank agents, the introduction of priority \nsector lending and financial literacy programs, and the imposition of the minimum lending rate in \n2016. However, financial inclusion remains inadequate because of limited access to finance. \nMoreover, there is no consumer protection in Bhutan. Rural borrowers rarely have any means of \nrecourse if bank staff act improperly, and attentiveness to customer service appears to be lacking. \nCustomers  of  financial  institutions  in  Bhutan  are  poorly  informed  about  their  rights  and \nresponsibilities. There is no convenient mechanism for dispute resolution. During focus group \ndiscussions, some respondents reported that they had trouble resolving discrepancies between \n                                                \n9 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2017.

Since then, this response team \nhas handled and resolved about 250 computer incidents, of which about 83% were vulnerabilities found in systems, \nand  about  10%  systems  infected  by  malicious  codes. The  remaining  6%  were  phishing  emails  and  sites, \ncompromised systems, and intrusion attempts. There are also cases that were not reported or detected. \n11 As per the current seismic map of the country, provided by the Department of Geology and Mines, the best location \nfor a disaster recovery site is Bumthang. Alternate geographical locations for backup outside Bhutan may also be \nconsidered, but this may be complex since it would involve issues relating to cross-border data and sovereignty. \n12 Government of Bhutan, RMA. 2018.

The government\u2019s reform agenda. The program will support the government in its \ncommitment to continue reforms to make the finance sector more responsive to emerging \npriorities, while remaining stable and inclusive. This support is critical for the government to \nachieve  national  key  result  areas  of  the  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023,  such  as \nmacroeconomic  stability,  economic  diversification,  and  poverty  reduction  (footnote  3).  The \ngovernment has already prepared several long-term sector development strategies. In 2014, the \nRMA  formulated  the  Capital  Market  Master  Plan  for  Bhutan,  2014\u20132024,  which  provides \nadditional financial intermediation sources, including microfinance intermediaries that can serve \nas alternatives to commercial banks, on which Bhutan had previously depended.15 In 2017, the \ngovernment approved the Financial Sector Development Action Plan, which details reform actions \nthat affect, among others, the banking system, nonbank financial institutions, and financial \ninclusion and financial literacy.16 Since 2017, the RMA has established several payment system \ninfrastructures through regulatory reforms and system automation. In July 2019, the government \nlaunched the e-commerce guidelines and platform, and revised its foreign direct investment policy \nand cottage and small industry policy. The RMA adopted Macro Prudential Regulations in 2018. \nIn 2019, the RMA issued risk management guidelines to provide minimum standards for risk \nmanagement practices and to encourage financial institutions to adopt and implement a sound \nrisk management framework. The RMA also approved the establishment of the Rural Enterprise \nDevelopment Corporation Limited, which will be the first cottage and small industry bank to \noperate in Bhutan. It will be a specialized bank that will service the financing needs of cottage and \nsmall industries. \n \n11.  Policy reforms. The proposed program modality is a programmatic approach. It consists \nof  two  subprograms  that  are  designed  to  allow  ADB  to  remain  engaged  and  to  help  the \ngovernment implement increasingly complex long-term finance sector reforms. Each subprogram \nis a single tranche intervention. To supplement these, there is a post-program engagement \nframework that will guide the design of the reforms under a third subprogram. There are 9 policy \nactions under subprogram 1, and 13 policy actions under subprogram 2. These policy actions are \ndesigned to achieve three reform areas: (i) nonbank financial system developed, (ii) stability and \nintegrity of the financial system strengthened, and (iii) financial inclusion promoted. These are \npresented in detail in the government\u2019s Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) and the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n12.  Reform area 1: Nonbank financial system developed. This reform area is designed to \ndevelop medium-term and long-term debt instruments and to deepen the nonbank financial \nsystem.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  approved  both  a  long-term \ngovernment bond issuance strategy and an implementation plan. Under subprogram 2, the MOF \nwill  develop  rules  and  regulations  for  government  bond  issuance.  The  government  has \nestablished a committee to assess its present rules on issuing corporate bonds and commercial \npapers to help develop the domestic bond market.17 Introducing long-term debt instruments with \nan  established  yield  curve  will  establish  a  much-needed  benchmark  rate  for  long-dated \n                                                \n15 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority.

That policy \ncreates sustainable and inclusive pension and provident fund schemes by expanding membership \ncoverage to include private sector and self-employed individuals, consequently benefiting women \nwho constitute 61% of self-employed individuals.18 Under subprogram 2, the government will \napprove (i) a strategy for the expansion of coverage to these excluded groups, and (ii) rules and \nregulations for implementing the NPPF policy. In parallel under subprogram 1, the RMA issued a \ndirective to assess the solvency of insurance companies  based on how they comply  with \nprudential regulations. Under subprogram 2, the government plans to amend the Financial \nServices Act to allow insurance companies to introduce more insurance products, and thereby \ndiversify their portfolios and minimize risks. With respect to housing finance, the government \ndrafted  a  National  Human  Settlement  Policy  in  2015  and  conducted  a  housing  finance \nconsultation in 2016. Consequently, ADB completed a feasibility study for housing finance reform \nin February 2018. Under subprogram 1, the government used ADB\u2019s feasibility study in drafting \nits  National  Housing  Policy,  which  emphasizes  housing  affordability,  and  which  helps \ndisadvantaged  groups,  including  women,  to  access  housing  finance.  Subsequently,  under \nsubprogram 2, the government will establish a detailed strategy that will define fiscal measures \nand incentives, and that will identify the housing finance mechanisms to be used. Over the long \nterm, this will help the government establish a housing finance entity as a nonbank financial \ninstitution.19 \n \n13.  Reform area 2: Stability and integrity of the financial system strengthened. This \nreform area is designed to strengthen the banking and financial infrastructure and to provide for \neffective supervision. To achieve this, the RMA has instituted risk-based bank supervision, \nincluding  stress  testing,  and  has  designed  templates  for  institutional  risk  profiles  and  risk \nassessment. Under subprogram 1, the RMA has begun to implement provisioning for impaired \nloans to comply with the Bhutan Accounting Standards. The RMA will revise its Prudential \nRegulations to comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).20 Under \nsubprogram 1, the government enacted the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing \nof Terrorism Act 2018. The RMA approved AML/CFT Rules and Regulations 2018. These reforms \nhave improved Bhutan\u2019s technical compliance with the Recommendations of the Financial Action \nTask Force on Money Laundering, as noted in APG\u2019s follow-up report to the APG\u2019s 2016 mutual \nevaluation report on Bhutan.21 The follow-up report also upgraded the country\u2019s rating from \nnoncompliant to largely compliant in technically assessing risks and using a risk-based approach. \nUnder subprogram 2, the RMA will operationalize an online anti-money laundering reporting \nsystem. Similarly, in April 2019 under subprogram 1, the RMA issued a directive on implementing \na cybersecurity framework. Under subprogram 2, the RMA will adopt a business continuity plan \nand  a  cybersecurity  framework,  which  will  seek  to  preempt  cyber  threats  proactively. \nCybersecurity is monitored both by the Bhutan Computer Incident Response Team and by the \nRMA\u2019s Financial Institutions Cyber Response Team. Banks are implementing initiatives to comply \nwith the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certifications, \nwhich will enhance cybersecurity controls. \n                                                \n18 Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2019.

The entity might also issue local currency bonds, which \nwill offer investment opportunities to pension funds and insurance companies. \n20 The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan signed an agreement with the IFRS Foundation to adopt \nIFRS in a phased manner (phase 1 for 2013\u20132015, phase 2 for 2016\u20132017, and phase 3 for 2018\u20132019), aiming for \nfull adoption and compliance by 2021. \n21 APG. 2018. 2nd Follow-Up Report: Mutual Evaluation of Bhutan.

This reform area is designed to promote \nfinancial  inclusion  and to  enhance financial  literacy  by  focusing  on  disadvantaged groups, \nincluding the poor, youth, and women. Under subprogram 1, the RMA approved the National \nFinancial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), 2018\u20132023 and the National Financial Literacy Strategy \n(NFLS),  2018\u20132023.22 These  strategies  seek  to  improve  the  livelihoods  of  vulnerable  and \nmarginalized segments of the population, including women and youth, by enhancing their financial \nliteracy and capabilities and by giving them better access to financial services. The RMA also \napproved rules and regulations on consumer protection in connection with financial services to \nempower service users and to enhance consumer confidence. Financial service providers\u2014\ncomprising  five  banks,  three  insurance  companies,  and  six  microfinance  institutions\u2014will \nconsequently establish formal consumer grievance redressal mechanisms under subprogram 2. \nUnder subprogram 2, the RMA will expand the curriculum framework that it uses to educate both \nlocal government officials and students in nonformal education centers and technical training \ninstitutes, while focusing on women. The TA attached to the program will help the RMA to \nimplement the NFIS and NFLS effectively. To do so, under subprogram 2, the RMA will approve \nthe action plan for the NFIS and the NFLS. The action plan will widen and intensify access to \ncredit, especially among cottage and small industries, which comprise more than 95% of the total \nnumber of companies and employ significant numbers of women. The action plan will establish \nan  inclusive  green  finance  scheme  that  will  help  to  finance  entrepreneurs  who  invest  in \nenvironment-friendly projects. To promote access to credit by farmers, the government will \nimprove commodity trading facilities and establish a warehouse receipt financing scheme that will \nenable farmers to use receipts as collateral. \n \n15,  Post-program engagement framework. The program provides for a structured dialogue \nover 5\u201310 years on finance sector reforms between ADB, the MOF, and the RMA. Key activities \nunder  the  program  that  require  further  dialogue  to  promote  sustainability  include  (i)  the \ngovernment\u2019s issuance of domestic long-term bonds; (ii) the strategy and implementation plan for \naffordable housing, including measures to address women\u2019s constraints in accessing housing \nfinance; (iii) the risk profiling and assessment of all commercial banks; (iv) consumer protection; \nand (v) timely implementation of the NFIS and NFLS. A third subprogram may be proposed \ndepending on the positive outcome of subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has been a partner in Bhutan\u2019s development since 1982. The \nBhutan\u2013ADB partnership in the finance sector began in 1984 with the provision of the Industrial \nSector Study and the Establishment of a Development Financing Mechanism TA project. 23  This \nsubsequently helped the government to establish the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation, \nnow  called  Bhutan  Development  Bank  Limited.  ADB  was  also  instrumental  in  helping  to \nstrengthen the RMA\u2019s central banking role as the single regulator of banks and nonbanks under \nthe Financial Institution Act in 1992.24 This gave the RMA independence to determine monetary \npolicy. To support the RMA, ADB also helped to establish the Credit Information Bureau in 2009, \nthe Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan in 2010, and the Financial Intelligence \nUnit for AML/CFT in 2011. Subsequently, Bhutan has been continually reforming its finance \nsector, which has consequently deepened and expanded at about 14% annually in terms of \nassets on average from December 2014 to December 2018. This underlines the government\u2019s \ncommitment to reform. The Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s validation report of the country \npartnership strategy final review, 2014\u20132018 noted that, throughout its operations in Bhutan, ADB \n                                                \n22 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2018.

The  program  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  policy-based \nprograms that supported finance sector reforms, such as the first and the second Strengthening \nEconomic  Management  Program,  which  helped  the  government  implement  key  reforms  to \ndevelop the financial market and strengthen financial capacity.26 The design of the proposed \nprogram is also based on achievements and lessons from ongoing TA projects.27 Many of the \nreform actions are continuations of reforms that ADB supported previously. For example, the \nstress testing that began under the second Strengthening Economic Management Program has \nbeen expanded and intensified under this program. Financial literacy, also started under the \nsecond Strengthening Economic Management Program, is further promoted under this program. \nBhutan has continued AML/CFT reforms since receiving its mutual evaluation report in 2016. The \nprogram also supports the RMA\u2019s efforts to comply fully with the remaining recommendations \nthrough ongoing ADB TA projects (footnote 27). Although the MOF has been issuing short-term \ntreasury bills since 2009, this program seeks to deepen the market by introducing a long-term \nbond that extends the maturity of existing instruments. Bhutan has been complying in phases with \nIFRS standards and plans to comply fully by 2021.  \n \n18.  The reform actions under the program have been prepared to help the government realize \nits current capacity to improve cybersecurity in Bhutan. The Global Cyber Security Capacity \nCentre of the University of Oxford has suggested that the government should collaborate with \nindustry and civil society to promote cybersecurity and thereby encourage information and \ncommunication technology development. The Independent Evaluation Department validation \nreport noted that efforts to diversify the economy cannot be sustained without accompanying \npublic sector management and finance reforms that strengthen governance (footnote 1). \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program. ADB\u2019s value addition has been to support the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda through a strategic framework; informed policy dialogue; evidence-\nbased studies; and sequencing and pacing of reforms, particularly in planning and coordinating \nvarious elements of reforms. ADB also supports capacity building, including preparation of \nblueprints for specific reform actions, and the promotion of ownership among stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector. The \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach has been implemented more effectively \nsince 2017 when ADB\u2019s Bhutan Resident Mission expanded and undertook core tasks in country \noperations.  The  greater  field  presence  and  staff  strength  have  enabled  ADB  to  be  more \nresponsive to client needs and emerging issues in coordination with ADB experts from the South \nAsia  Department  and  other  departments,  including  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCoordination Department; Office of Anticorruption and Integrity; Office of the General Counsel; \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership; Office of Risk Management; Procurement, Portfolio and \nFinancial  Management  Department;  Private  Sector  Operations  Department;  Treasury \nDepartment; and Sustainable Development and Climate Chance Department. \n \n                                                \n25 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Manila.  \n ", "8 \n20.  Development partner coordination. The involvement of development partners in the \nfinance sector is well defined.28 The design of the proposed reforms is informed by a number of \nstudies supported by ADB and other development partners. Access to credit was identified as \none of the major critical development constraints in a diagnostic study on Bhutan that ADB \nprepared with the Government of Australia and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.29 \nThe government adopted its Capital Market Master Plan in 2014 following ADB TA that created, \namong others, a blueprint for a debt market strategy.30 The World Bank created the Financial \nSector Development Action Plan for Bhutan, which was approved by the government in 2017. \nAlso in 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) established the South Asia Regional Training \nand Technical Assistance Center for economic capacity building in New Delhi. The IMF is helping \nthe government set up a liquidity forecasting framework. This aligns with the goal of moving the \nconduct of monetary policy from direct to indirect monetary instruments. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n21.  The impact of the reform will be the improved economic welfare of the Bhutanese people, \nespecially  women,  through  increased  employment,  private  sector  business  development, \nenhanced access to finance, and greater efficiency of financial intermediation. The program will \nsupport the government with institutional reforms  while improving the technical capacity of \nregulatory and financial institutions. The first reform area of this program seeks to develop the \nnonbank financial system by issuing both a long-term government bond and corporate bonds. \nThis will increase the volume of bonds traded in the capital market. By 2023, the total value of \noutstanding bonds is expected to reach Nu9.3 billion (about $130 million), an increase of 7% from \nthe 2018 baseline. The second reform area aims to strengthen the stability of the financial system. \nThis will further increase the year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by commercial \nbanks. The program\u2019s target for this is to increase the average 2014\u20132018 baseline rate of 14.7% \nto at least an average of 17.0% for 2019\u20132023. The third reform area is to promote financial \ninclusion by implementing the NFIS and the NFLS. This will improve the private sector\u2019s access \nto finance. The target is for the percentage of adults who have access to credit to reach at least \n18.0% by 2023 compared with the 16.0% baseline of 2018. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n22.  The total expenditure for the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 is estimated at Nu310 \nbillion (about $4.3 billion), an increase of 38% from that of the previous 5-year plan. Of the total \nexpenditure, current expenditure accounts for 62.5%, or Nu193.90 billion (about $2.7 billion), all \nof which is financed by domestic revenue. Capital expenditure accounts for 37.5%, or Nu116.12 \nbillion (about $1.6 billion), 21% of which is financed by domestic revenue. Domestic revenue thus \nfinances roughly 70%, or Nu218.16 billion (about $3.1 billion), of total expenditure. Financing is \nrequired to fund the remaining 79% of capital expenditure. Of capital expenditure, 54% will be \nfinanced through grants. The final 25% of capital expenditure will be financed by external \nborrowings from multilateral development partners, mainly from ADB and the World Bank, on \nhighly concessional terms. The external financing gap over the 5-year period is estimated at Nu29 \nbillion (about $406 million). \n \n23.  The government has requested a loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a \n                                                \n28 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2013.

The \nindicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital \nresources. Bhutan was assessed to have a moderate risk in the 2018 IMF\u2013World Bank debt \nsustainability assessment. The IMF assessment letter provides current assessment of Bhutan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic conditions, prospects, and policies (Appendix 2). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The MOF is the executing agency, and the RMA and the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement are implementing agencies. A steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the \nMOF, was established for guiding and monitoring the program implementation. The proceeds of \nthe policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The implementation period is January 2018\u2013November \n2019 for subprogram 1, and December 2019\u2013March 2022 for subprogram 2. ADB will support the \ngovernment in implementing the post-program engagement framework to promote sustainable \noutcomes. All subprogram 1 policy actions were accomplished. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The TA will be implemented over 27 \nmonths from December 2019 to March 2022 to support financial inclusion activities and post-\nprogram  engagement  activities.  It  will  require  a  total  of  12  person-months  of  international \nconsultancy  services  and  14  person-months  of  national  consultancy  services.  Individual \nconsultants will be engaged. The TA will assist in (i) preparing regulatory frameworks and \nbackground analyses; (ii) building the capacity of government agencies and financial institutions \nto implement reforms; and (iii) raising the financial literacy levels of disadvantaged groups, \nincluding women and youth. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \ndomestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ndisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  Safeguards. The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguards policies and is classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.31 \n \n27.  Poverty  and  social.  Bhutan\u2019s  limited  financial  market  development  has  had  a \ndisproportionate impact on the poor. Only 25% of adults in the poorest 40% of households in \nBhutan have a bank account while in other developing economies the rate is 50% based on 2014 \ndata.32 Also, as of December 2017, although 64.5% of adults in Bhutan had a savings account, \nonly 6.1% had access to credit, and 17.8% held a life insurance policy (footnote 12). Insufficient \naccess to affordable credit and other financial services, coupled with low financial literacy and a \nlack of consumer protection mechanisms, constrains the ability of the poor to improve their lives. \nReforms under the program will help the government achieve its poverty reduction target by \n                                                \n31 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n32 Government of Bhutan, Royal Monetary Authority. 2018.

The  program  also  includes  the \ndevelopment of lending covenants for housing and homeownership, and introduction of risk-\nsharing arrangements to help expand access to credit. The program objectives and activities also \nalign with the goal of advancing gender equality and empowering women by improving women\u2019s \naccess to financial resources. The government will monitor the progress of how women increase \ntheir access to credit, accrue savings, obtain insurance, and receive pensions, and will report to \nADB as part of its continuing policy dialogue. \n \n28.  Governance. Bhutan\u2019s inherent financial management risk is considered moderate. The \n2016 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment reported improvements from the \nprevious assessment (2010).33 However, the lowest scores were given  for accounting and \nreporting, government transparency, and budget reliability. Consequently, the government is \nimplementing a public finance management reform action plan that covers five reform measures, \nof which two measures have yet to be implemented: (i) integration of the civil services information \nsystem with the payroll system, and (ii) integration of the planning and monitoring system with the \nmultiyear rolling budget system and the public expenditure management system. In terms of \ncorruption, Bhutan consistently scores high on global indexes for control of corruption, ranking \n25th out of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 Corruption Perception Index. The \ndomestic perception of corruption, however, has been worsening. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n29.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n30.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Financial Market Development Program; and \n(ii)  the loan of $30,000,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Financial Market \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period \nand 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 October 2019 \n                                                \n33 World Bank. 2016.
