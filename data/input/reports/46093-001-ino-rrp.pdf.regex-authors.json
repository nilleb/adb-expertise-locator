THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Inclusive Growth through Improved Connectivity Program; and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the Inclusive \nGrowth through Improved Connectivity Program. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Supporting Inclusive Growth through Better Connectivity, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program will support a key strategic pillar of the government\u2019s medium- and long-\nterm  development  plans  to  achieve  higher  and  more  inclusive  economic  growth  through \nstronger domestic and international connectivity. The government\u2019s long-term Master Plan for \nAcceleration  and  Expansion  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Economic  Development,  2011\u20132025  (MP3EI) \nrecognizes that the policy and regulatory environment still constrains connectivity and related \ninfrastructure development. Therefore, the MP3EI includes regulatory reforms as an integral \nstep in accelerating economic development. The government has launched a series of reforms \naimed  at  improving  the  policy,  regulatory,  financial,  institutional,  and  business  climate \nframeworks for connectivity and infrastructure development. A stronger enabling environment \nfor  domestic  and  international connectivity  will in  turn  ensure  that necessary  infrastructure \ninvestments by the public and private sectors are more efficient, effective, and sustainable. The \nprogram will focus on supporting the government\u2019s reform agenda and infrastructure-related \nefforts to accelerate improvement in the country\u2019s domestic and international connectivity.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s economic growth performance and poverty. Gross domestic product \ngrowth edged up to 6.5% year-on-year in 2011 (the highest since the Asian crisis 1997\u20131998), \nsupported by sustained private consumption, stronger investment, and expanding net exports. \nNonetheless, economic growth is still significantly below the country\u2019s growth potential. For \n2014\u20132016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a baseline potential growth rate of \n7.1%, which would increase to 7.9% if infrastructure development and economic reforms were \naccelerated.  An  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study  also  highlights  inadequacies  in \ninfrastructure as a critical constraint to economic growth.2 Indonesia\u2019s overall ranking in the \nGlobal Competitiveness Index is at 50 out of 144 countries.3 However, the country ranks only 78 \nout of 144 on quality of infrastructure, far below its overall ranking, implying that infrastructure is \na  drag  on  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  (Figure 1a).  The  impact  of  lagging  infrastructure \nappears in a number of forms. Deteriorating roads in the provinces and districts increase \ndomestic  transport  and  logistics  costs.  Congested  ports  and  underdeveloped  interisland \ntransport  have  led  to  expensive  domestic  shipping  costs.  Congested  and  underdeveloped \ninternational  ports  limit  the  efficient  integration  of  Indonesia\u2019s  manufacturing  sector  into \ninternational production networks. \n \n4.  Poverty reduction. Growth of 6.5% in 2011 resulted in about 1.5 million new jobs being \ngenerated, exceeding the number of new entrants to the labor force. The quality of employment \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  H. Hill, M. E. Khan, and, J. Zhuong, eds.

Geneva.  ", "2 \nalso improved as formal employment rose by 5.7 million jobs, while employment in the informal \nsector fell by 4.2 million jobs, as workers left the agricultural labor force. However, formidable \nefforts are needed to reduce poverty incidence further. About 62% of the employed labor force \n(about 68.2 million people) still works in the informal sector, where wages and job security are \nlow. Poverty incidence fell to 12% in March 2012, from 12.5% in March 2011. While the overall \npoverty incidence has trended downward, achievement varies across the country. The national \nrural poverty incidence of 15.6% is still much higher than the national urban poverty incidence of \n9.1%. Poverty rates in some provinces in eastern Indonesia are much higher than elsewhere in \nthe country\u2014for example, 25.3% in Maluku and Papua (Figure 1b). \n \nFigure 1: Infrastructure and Poverty Gap \na.

Global \nCompetitiveness Report, 2011\u20132012. \n \n5.  Inclusive growth through better developed connectivity. Alleviating the country\u2019s \nmultidimensional poverty will require not only accelerated economic growth but also a more \ninclusive growth process that provides rural areas and disadvantaged regions with greater \neconomic opportunity and access to social services. Improving and developing the country\u2019s \nconnectivity is key to reducing poverty incidence by (i) connecting rural areas with regional \ngrowth poles, thereby widening access to markets and services; (ii) connecting the poorer \neastern parts of Indonesia with markets in western areas through more efficient interisland \ntransport systems; and (iii) improving international connectivity to boost the competitiveness of \nthe country\u2019s productive sector. Combined, connectivity efforts are expected to have a key \nfacilitating role in increasing employment, reducing the size of the labor force employed in the \ninformal sector, increasing access to and delivery of services, and thereby enhancing economic \nproductivity and social well-being, and reducing the overall poverty incidence. \n \n6.  Convergence of government national strategies and ADB strategy. The government \nrecognizes that lagging infrastructure, underdeveloped intra-island and interisland connectivity, \nweak international connectivity, and inefficient logistics constrain achieving its medium- and \nlong-term targets of higher growth and faster poverty reduction. Strategically, the government\u2019s \nNational Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), 2010\u20132014 provides direction for the two \npillars  of  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014:  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmental  sustainability.4 Reforms  assisted  by  the  proposed  program  will  support  the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Indonesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n ", "3 \ninclusive growth pillar of the country partnership strategy. In addition, improving connectivity is a \nstrategic focus of the MP3EI. The MP3EI will guide the convergence of ADB\u2019s policy-based, \nsector,  and  thematic  interventions  related  to  connectivity  and  the  government\u2019s  vision  of \naccelerated economic development.  \n  \n7.  Lessons  from  ADB  policy-based  loans  and  development  coordination.  Several \nlessons from the previous country partnership and strategy for Indonesia (2006\u20132009) and \nsupport for policy-based loans were considered.5 Achieving tangible results with ADB\u2019s relatively \nmodest  program  requires  selective  support  targeting  key  government  priorities and  use  of \nprogrammatic approaches in coordination with other development partners. Specifically, ADB \neffectiveness can be increased by (i) concentrating on a more limited set of program areas \nwhere there are clear synergies between ADB\u2019s, policy, project and private sector support, \n(ii) focusing on core sectors identified by Strategy 20206 and emphasizing sectors where ADB \nhas a strong track record, and (iii) supporting operations where ADB can play a catalytic role \nwith good prospects for collaboration with other partners. The program will involve collaborative \ncofinancing with the World Bank. In addition, ADB coordinates with the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  on  infrastructure  issues  through  its  Infrastructure  Development \nInitiative Project in Indonesia. The program builds on ADB\u2019s earlier policy-based loans, notably \nthe Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program, which supported government reforms \nto  improve  regulatory  frameworks,  open  up  key  infrastructure  sectors  for  private  sector \nparticipation, including public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), increase competition, and improve \ninfrastructure.7 A key lesson is to simplify the program to focus on high-impact policy reforms.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  will  be  to  reduce  transport  and  logistics  costs,  a  key  requirement  for \nachieving higher and more inclusive economic growth that is sustained over the medium term. \nThe outcome will be more developed domestic and international connectivity anchored on more \nrigorous  coordination  and  regulation,  which  will  help  generate  more  and  better  jobs  and \ncontribute to sustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The programmatic approach consists of two subprograms sequenced to support the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term reforms to strengthen domestic and international connectivity. The \nprogram supports the government\u2019s efforts in four core reform areas: (i) strengthening national \ncoordination, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for more effective implementation of the \nconnectivity agenda; (ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity to and from growth poles, with \noptimal use of resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of land transportation \nand networks; (iii) improving interisland connectivity by stepping up efficiencies and service \nperformance  of  domestic  air  and  sea  transportation;  and  (iv)  enhancing  international \nconnectivity by making Indonesia\u2019s ports more efficient in handling traffic and trade volume. The \npolicy actions (Appendix 4) have been developed to ensure consistency with the government\u2019s \ndevelopment efforts and initiatives, as outlined in the RPJMN 2010\u20132014 and the MP3EI 2011\u2013\n2025. All the core policy actions under subprogram 1 were completed by mid-September 2012 \nand  prior  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement.  Subprogram  2  will  continue  reform \nprogress achieved in subprogram 1. The outputs of subprogram 1 will be:  \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

The  policy  reforms  will  strengthen  coordination  across  institutions  and  harmonize \nregulations related to connectivity and logistics. Execution and policymaking for connectivity fall \nunder the jurisdiction of several ministries and local governments. The Ministry of Public Works \nhas  primary  responsibility  for  efforts  to  improve  intra-island  connectivity,  but  with \ndecentralization, local governments are involved in infrastructure development and maintenance \nin the provinces and districts. The main authority for interisland and international connectivity is \nthe Ministry of Transport. However, other ministries are responsible for some soft infrastructure \nsuch as customs, trade regulations, and connectivity within the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN),  including  Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand  Growth  Triangle  and  the  Brunei \nDarussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area.  In  this  context,  the \ngovernment  recognizes  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  policy  coordination  across \nagencies. While MP3EI is an important step in providing strategic policy guidance on national \nconnectivity  improvements,  it  still  requires  instruments  and  mechanisms  to  strengthen  its \noperational effectiveness in coordinating and strengthening policy reforms.  \n \n11.  Task forces for connectivity and logistics. The government set up a coordinating \nmechanism equipped with the political mandate to coordinate policy reforms on connectivity \nbeyond the core economic agencies. Presidential Regulation No. 32/2011 was issued, which \nappoints the Minister of the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) as the executive \nchairman for implementing MP3EI. This regulation forms the basis for the establishment of the \npolicy  coordination  mechanism.  To  facilitate  implementation,  CMEA  issued  a  decree \nestablishing  a  high-level,  cross-ministerial  task  force  with  a  mandate  to  coordinate  policy \nreforms on connectivity. CMEA also issued a decree establishing a task force to coordinate \nimplementation  of  logistics-related  reforms.  These  measures  are  expected  to  strengthen \ncoordination among agencies responsible for supervising activities along the logistics chain and \nresolve logistics and intermodal transport issues.  \n \n12.  Viability gap fund to support public\u2013private partnership projects. Recognizing the \nlimited  public  resources  available  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  large  financing  needs  for  future \ninfrastructure, the government has devoted significant efforts to attracting and leveraging private \nfinancing  of  infrastructure  through  PPPs.  The  government  has  made  good  progress  in \nestablishing a supportive regulatory and institutional framework for PPP infrastructure, including \n(i) the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund as a single window to appraise and provide \ngovernment guarantees for well-prepared infrastructure PPPs; (ii) the Indonesia Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility to mobilize long-term local currency funds to finance PPPs in infrastructure; \nand  (iii)  more  stringent  PPP  project  preparation.  While  some  projects  are  socially  and \neconomically  desirable,  they  are  not  always  financially  viable  due  to  limited  cost-recovery \nprospects through user fees or tariffs. This has constrained private sector interest, underscoring \nthe need to close the financial viability gap with public resources. The government is setting up \na viability gap fund (VGF) to provide public-finance support to well-prepared PPP projects and \nso boost their bankability and financial viability. A draft ministerial decree for the establishment \nof the fund has been submitted for Ministry of Finance approval. \n \n2.  Intra-Island Connectivity Upgraded \n \n13.  Improving intra-island connectivity is an important part of the government\u2019s connectivity \nstrategy to reduce rural poverty. The policy reforms will support the government\u2019s efforts to \naccelerate development of intermodal transport systems and infrastructure to improve access \nfrom rural areas to the nearest growth poles and between industrial zones and ports. Linking \n ", "5 \nrural areas with growth poles within islands is constrained by inadequate road infrastructure, \nand underdeveloped railway networks. Although road investment in relative terms to gross \ndomestic product has again reached the pre-1998 financial crisis level, it continues to lag behind \nthe growth in traffic volume. The government recognizes the need for increased infrastructure \ninvestment and creating the right incentives for local governments to construct better roads and \nmaintain the quality of local roads. Meanwhile, more progress is needed in reorganizing the \nrailway  system  and  improving  arrangements  that  govern  subsidies  and  public  service \nobligations, and railway maintenance services. The rail sector has potential to play an important \nrole in providing efficient passenger and freight services.  \n \n14.  Law on land acquisition for public use. The inability to acquire land for public use has \nbeen a key reason for the delayed disbursement of the government\u2019s capital spending in the \ntransport sector. The private sector considers the land acquisition problem a major source of \nuncertainty in project development, costs, and implementation, lowering investor confidence on \nthe prospects for road investment. It has also delayed the development of PPPs, particularly for \ntoll roads. Overcoming this fundamental constraint is key to advancing the connectivity and \ninfrastructure agenda. Consequently, Parliament passed the Land Acquisition Law for Public \nUse (Law No. 2/2012), which is a critical step toward attracting and mobilizing infrastructure \ninvestment. The absence of such a law in the past has generated uncertainties over costs and \ntime required to implement infrastructure projects. The law is instrumental in facilitating PPPs \nacross various sectors, most notably for toll roads, and where private investors expect strong \nsupport from the government in resolving land issues. In August 2012, the government issued \nPresidential Decree No. 71/2012 to implement the law. \n \n15.  Restructuring  the  railway  services.  Before  2007,  rail  services  and  associated \ninfrastructure were a monopoly service owned and operated solely by the government, lowering \nincentives to improve services. Railway Law No. 23/2007 marked a crucial reform milestone that \ndefines  and  regulates  railway  network  infrastructure  and  services.  The  law  separated \ninfrastructure  and  operating  aspects  of  the  railway  sector,  thus  allowing  for  a  third-party \noperator. The rail service is now open to competition from the private sector and allows new \noperators to obtain access to state-owned rail infrastructure. This is a fundamental change that \nwill have a far-reaching impact on the future of rail operations in Indonesia. To improve the \noperational viability of the railway services, the government issued Presidential Decree No. \n53/2012 establishing a budgetary mechanism to transfer subsidies for public service obligations \nin railway services, and to reimburse infrastructure operation and maintenance costs and track-\naccess charges to the government\u2019s railway infrastructure. The decree covers payments to \nprivate  operators  that  are  competing  to  provide  noncommercial  railway  services.  Further \nimplementing regulations of Law No. 23/2007 on the Railway Services Network are needed to \nsupport the restructuring of railway services. \n \n16.  Performance-based  road  construction  and  maintenance.  The public expenditure \nreview of the road sector by the World Bank finds that 24% of provincial roads and 41% of \ndistrict roads are in bad or poor condition.8 The performance is better for national roads, where \nonly 12% are in bad or poor condition. To address this problem, the government has introduced, \non a pilot basis, performance-based contracts for the construction of new roads. In addition, the \nwarranty period for road rehabilitation has been extended to 2 years. The performance-based \ncontracts are expected to be expanded over the medium term with detailed guidelines to be \nissued by the Ministry of Public Works.  \n \n                                                 \n8 World  Bank.  2012.  Investing  in  Indonesia\u2019s  Roads:  Improving  Efficiency  and  Closing  the  Financing  Gap. \nWashington, DC.  \n ", "6 \n3.  Interisland Connectivity Improved \n \n17.  The  key  objectives  of  interisland  connectivity  reforms  are  to  strengthen  the  policy \nframework to facilitate improvement in port productivity and to improve transport access in the \neastern part of Indonesia. In a large, archipelagic country with a dispersed population, reducing \nthe cost of interisland shipping is expected to make a significant contribution to facilitating \neconomic growth and poverty reduction by connecting islands through lower cost and higher \nvolume trade and movement of people. At present, domestic shipping costs constitute a large \nportion of producers\u2019 total costs, and are being passed on to consumers throughout the country. \nReflecting poor logistics and inadequate transport infrastructure, about 70% of the rice price \ndifferences across provinces is explained by the degree of remoteness.9 The high cost of \nshipping  is  due  to  a  combination  of  inadequate  hard  and  soft  infrastructure  in  the  ports. \nAccording  to  one  estimate,  the  average  turnaround  time  for  domestic  shipping  at  the \n25 strategic ports is 2.7 days. Given an average sailing time of 1.5 days, ships are spending \nabout 75% of the total time between destinations at port.    \n \n18.  Information  and  communication  technology  fund.  Efforts  to  improve  interisland \nconnectivity requires improvement in information and communications technology (ICT) and \nsystems to better facilitate and complement physical transportation services, particularly in \neastern and rural areas. As one of the policy initiatives to accelerate ICT connectivity in the \neastern provinces, the government will establish an ICT fund through the issuance of Ministerial \nCommunication  Decree  No.  21/2012.  The  fund  aims  to  improve  the  feasibility  of  private \ninvestment  in  the  provision  of  affordable  broadband  services  to  areas  that  are  not  yet \ncommercially  viable,  which  includes  many  parts  of  eastern  Indonesia.  The  fund  will  offer \nfinancial  and  other  support  incentives  for  ICT  service  providers,  to  be  auctioned  on  a \ncompetitive basis and structured through regularly reviewed multi-year contracts of up to 5 \nyears.  \n  \n19.  Labor regulation on cargo handling. Labor costs play an important role in increasing \nlogistics costs. So far, under a joint decree of the Directorates General of Cooperatives, Sea \nTransport,  and  Industrial  Relations,  all  labor  services  for  cargo  handling  at  seaports  are \nprovided through a dedicated labor cooperative (Koperasi TKBM). The regulation effectively \ngave monopoly power to Koperasi TKBM for cargo handling at Indonesia\u2019s seaports, which \nsignificantly raised costs, particularly for non-containerized products such as agricultural, raw, \nand bulk materials. To address this issue, the government has revised the joint decree to allow \nfor more competition in cargo handling, which in the medium term will increase port productivity \nand lower logistics cost.  \n \n4.  International Connectivity Enhanced \n \n20.  The reforms aim to improve regulatory certainty in customs clearance and reduce ship \ndwelling time. The bulk of the country\u2019s international trade is facilitated by five main ports. The \nlargest is Tanjung Priok, the country\u2019s main international gateway in Jakarta, serving about 70% \nof internationally traded goods. Tanjung Priok also serves 29% of container traffic between Java \nand other islands. While Tanjung Priok is Indonesia\u2019s most efficient port, its productivity is much \nlower than that of major ports in the ASEAN region. Ship dwelling time in Tanjung Priok was \n6.7 days in January 2012 compared with only 4.9 days in 2010. The cost of delivering one \ncontainer from Cikarang (the nearest industrial zone) to Tanjung Priok across a distance of \nabout 56 kilometers is $750, much higher than the cost ($450) across a similar distance in \n                                                 \n9\u00a0\u00a0World Bank. 2010. Logistics Performance Index 2010: Indonesia. Washington, DC. \u00a0\n ", "7 \nMalaysia (from Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelepas). The 2012 Logistics Performance Index, \nwhich  measured  the  efficiency  of  logistics  services  for  international  trade,  confirms  that \nIndonesia\u2019s  performance  is  much  lower  than  that  of  neighboring  countries  due  to  lagging \ninfrastructure support.  \n \n21.  National  logistics  system  blueprint.  The  government  issued  Presidential  Decree \nNo. 26/2012  for  a  national  logistics  blueprint  to  establish  an  integrated  and  more  efficient \nlogistics system that would increase national competitiveness. The objectives of the strategy are \nto reduce logistics costs, develop more efficient distributon of goods across the archipelago, and \nto  prepare  for  integration  in  ASEAN  logistics  systems.  The  strategy  specifies  short-  and \nmedium-term reform targets. The high-level task force for logistics will oversee implementation \nof reforms to achive the targets in coordination with MP3EI implementation.  \n \n22.  Indonesia National Single Window and dry port. Improving transparency in trade \nregulations is key to facilitating international trade. While efforts to simplify export and import \nprocedures are ongoing, the number of agencies and documents involved remains large. Thus, \nthe Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) plays an important role in reducing the time and \ncosts of importing and exporting by facilitating single submission, single processing, and single \napproval  of  import/export  documents.  In  March  2012,  the  government  issued  Presidential \nDecree No. 35/2012 to amend Presidential Decree No. 8/2008 to make the INSW the only \nreference portal for cross-border trade regulations in the customs clearance process. This will \nmake all trade regulations accessible to the public and help to streamline these procedures. \nGiven forecast growth in cargo volume of 20% annually, port expansion will be necessary in the \nmedium term. In the short term, the dry ports in Cikarang and near the industrial district of \nJababeka can be optimized. The government has extended the INSW system and services to \nCikarang dry port.   \n \n23.  Policy triggers for subprogram 2. The program recognizes that achieving its intended \noutcome will require a coherent medium-term reform strategy. It has specified 10 indicative \ntriggers that need to be satisfactorily completed by September 2013 (Appendix 4). The triggers \nwill advance reforms accomplished under subprogram 1, focusing on implementation of the \nLand Acquisition Law, making the VGF operational, issuance of investment plan to improve the \nnational road network, implementation of further restructuring in the railway system, completion \nof contract award for backbone development for eastern Indonesia, and establishment of a \npermanent agency to run the INSW. The program also recognizes the necessity for flexibility in \nthe reform measures for subprogram 2 to reflect the changing economic environment and \nensure continued strong government ownership of the reforms.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n24.  The loan amount is based on the strengths of the policy package, its development \nimpact, the importance of the sectors covered, indicative costs of reform, and the government\u2019s \nfinancing needs. Implementation of some policy reforms, such as the establishment of the VGF \nand ICT funds, requires adjustment costs. Effective implementation of connectivity reforms will \nalso require capacity improvements at related agencies. Government has doubled its annual \nbudget allocation for the transport sector since 2010 to Rp 54.2 ($5.7 billion) in 2012 to support \nimproved connectivity. Indonesia\u2019s gross financing needs remain high despite its low budget \ndeficit and continued decline in debt-to-GDP ratio. In 2012, with a budget deficit target of 2.2% \nof GDP, the government will need to borrow Rp326.8 trillion ($36 billion), reflecting increasing \ndebt amortization. The government has requested a total of $1.7 billion in policy-based lending \nfrom development partners, of which $600 million is from ADB. \n ", "8 \n \n25.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan of $300 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. The financing for subprogram 2 is currently planned to be $200 \nmillion. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full exchange cost (excluding local taxes \nand duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of the \npolicy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provision of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans10 to Indonesia. The \nWorld  Bank  will  provide  collaborative  cofinancing  of  $100 million  while  the  amount  of  the \nGovernment of Japan\u2019s support is being discussed with the Government of Indonesia. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The program period for subprogram 1 is from June 2011 to September 2012 and the \nprogram period for subprogram 2 is from October 2012 to September 2013. The National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) will be the executing agency. The implementing \nagencies will be the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Transport, Ministry \nof Communication, National Land Agency, and CMEA. The government will form a steering \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  vice-minister  of  BAPPENAS,  with  senior  representatives  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  and  development  partners  (ADB,  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, and the World Bank) as members. The committee will meet semi-annually to discuss \ninterim progress in achieving agreed policy actions and milestones in the reform agenda. The \ncommittee will work with the connectivity working group, which is also chaired by BAPPENAS \nand responsible for coordinating the implementation of the government\u2019s connectivity reform \nagenda under MP3EI.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n27.  Impact and outcome. The impact of the capacity development TA will be to strengthen \nimplementation of reforms that improve interisland connectivity. The outcome will be stronger \ncapacity of BAPPENAS, CMEA, and the Ministry of Transport to carry out policy analysis to \ninform decisions on connectivity policy needed to implement their annual plan and strategy.  \n \n28.  Financing  and  implementing  arrangements.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.18 \nmillion, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-other sources). The TA will help the government to accelerate the development \nand  implementation  of  reforms  in  the  four  core  policy  areas  covered  by  the  loan11 by  (i) \npreparing  a  series  of  comprehensive  policy  analyses  and  notes  on  connectivity  issues  to \ndevelop innovative policies; (ii) supporting the establishment of the new INSW agency and \nconducting initial review of MP3EI implementation, including an in-depth impact analysis of \nselected logistics constraints and MP3EI projects; (iii) supporting the initial work for preparation \nof a policy framework, and an implementation road map for private sector participation and \nPPPs,  in  the  transport  sector;  and  (iv) developing  a  capacity  building  program  for  key \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998.

BAPPENAS  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  In  consultation  with \nBAPPENAS,  ADB  will  recruit  consultants  as  required  under  the  TA  (34 person-months  of \nconsulting services,  consisting of one international consultant for 16 person-months and two \nnational consultants for a total of 18 person-months). The consultants will be selected and \nengaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).12 TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). The government will provide in-kind contribution in the form of \ncounterpart staff and office space, which is estimated to account for 15% of the total TA cost. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The policy actions of the program are derived from the government\u2019s medium-term \nreform priorities, which are crucial in achieving the government\u2019s higher and more inclusive \ngrowth  strategy.  The  proposed  reforms  are  expected  to  stimulate  increased  infrastructure \ninvestment, which could generate additional economic growth of about 1 percentage point \nannually over the medium term. A single reform to reduce the dwelling time at Tanjung Priok \nport to 3 days is estimated to generate economic benefits of over $450 million (based on 2010 \nprices).13  \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  The government has made considerable progress in the legal and regulatory framework \nfor  public  financial  management.  Since  the  enactment  of  the  laws  on  state  finance,  state \ntreasury, and state audit in 2003\u20132004, most of the regulations underpinning the laws have \nbeen promulgated. In 2009, the government achieved its first qualified audit opinion from the \nExternal  Audit  Agency,  and  about  40%  of  ministries  and  agencies  achieved  unqualified \nopinions. ADB reinforces this momentum with continuing support to improve technical capacity \nand  controls.  Building  on  previous  programs,  ADB  TA  for  Strengthening  National  Public \nProcurement Processes has been committed to boost transparency and efficiency in public \nprocurement  processes.14 Initial  findings  from  the  2011  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability repeat assessment show marked progress in budget controls and reporting. As a \nresult  of  the  government\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  reduce  corruption,  Transparency \nInternational\u2019s control of corruption perception index for Indonesia rose to 3.0 in 2011, from 2.8 \nin  2010.15 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with BAPPENAS.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The reforms supported under the program will accelerate economic growth and thus \ngenerate more productive jobs, which are key to reducing poverty and reducing the risk of the \n                                                 \n12  Given the nature of the expertise required, it is deemed more appropriate to engage consultants individually than \nhiring them through a firm. \n13 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2010.

The program will also promote better connectivity \nfor rural areas and eastern Indonesia, which is expected to aid faster reduction of poverty \nincidence in these areas.16 Impact assessments of the program are expected to demonstrate \nthe productivity and poverty-reducing effects of connectivity reforms and development. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  under \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The three main risks to the program, rated low to medium, are: (i) weak coordination in \nand between key government agencies; (ii) continued under disbursement of capital spending; \nand (iii) increased international fuel prices, which could divert government budgetary resources \nfrom capital investment to fuel subsidies. To mitigate risks (i) and (ii), the government has set up \na high-level task force for connectivity and tasked the President\u2019s delivery unit to monitor the \nprogress. For the third risk, Parliament has approved a mechanism in the 2012 budget to \nincrease domestic fuel prices should they exceed a pre-determined threshold.17  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n34.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve  \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Inclusive  Growth  through  Improved \nConnectivity Program; and  \n(ii)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nInclusive Growth through Improved Connectivity Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of \n15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n24 October 2012 \n                                                 \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms  Risks\nImpact      Assumption \nReduced transport  By 2018:    Macroeconomic \nand logistics costs   stability maintained \nLower share of transport and  BPS \nlogistics costs in the total cost of  Risk \n \nproduction by 5% (2011 baseline:  Implementation \n27%)    delay due to \nregulatory and \nReal gross domestic product  BPS \npolitical processes \ngrowth increased to above 7% \n \n(2011 baseline: 6.5%) \n \nPoverty rate in rural and eastern  BPS \nIndonesia decreasing more \nquickly (2012 baseline: 15.6% for \nrural poverty and 25.3% for \npoverty in Papua and Maluku) \nOutcome      Assumption\nBetter developed  By end 2013:    Government \ndomestic and    staying on course \nReduction in land acquisition  BPS and report from \ninternational  with its key \ndelays for key projects supporting  investment board \nconnectivity  structural reforms \nconnectivity (to maximum \n \n  400 days in 2013)  Risk \n \nWeak coordination \nIncreased share of public and  BPS and other \nin government \nprivate investments in the  independent surveys \nagencies \ntransport sector by 3% (2011 \n \nbaseline: 17%)  Reform slowed by \n  vested interest \nDwelling time in Tanjung Priok \nport reduced to 5 days (2011   \nbaseline: 6.7 days) \n \nDwelling time in key regional  Report from the minister \nports reduced by 2 days (2011  of transport \nbaseline: 5 days) \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
