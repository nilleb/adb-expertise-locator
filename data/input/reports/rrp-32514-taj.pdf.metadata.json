The  project  area  covers  5,080  square  kilometers\n(km) south of the capital Dushanbe. The population of Khatlon\nRegion  is  approximately  2.1  million,  comprising  one  third  of\nthe country's population. Poverty incidence in the project area\nis  estimated  at  91  percent.  Economic  activity  in  Khatlon\nRegion is primarily agricultural with cotton, grains, fruits,  and\nvegetables  being  the  most  important  crops.  The  Project  will\nregion  by\nthe \nimprove \nrehabilitating \nthe\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  and  improving  rural  roads  in  the\narea.\n\ntransport \nthe  most  deteriorated  sections  of \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe \n\nin \n\ninitial  environment  examination  was  undertaken,  a\n\nAn \nsummary is attached.\n\nThe  improvement  of  road  transport  services  is  vital  for\neconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  Tajikistan,\nwhich  is  the  poorest  of  the  Central  Asian  republics.  The\nbreakup  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  civil  conflict,  and  major\nnatural  disasters  have  resulted  in  a  dramatic  decline  of\neconomic  activity  and  increase  in  poverty.  Poverty  incidence\nis currently estimated at 91 percent in the project area and 83\npercent  in  Tajikistan  overall.  Rehabilitation  of  the  country\u2019s\nroad  infrastructure  is  necessary  to  sustain  the  economic\nrecovery  now  under  way  and  to  reduce  poverty.  Roads  are\nthe  most  important  mode  of  domestic  freight  and  passenger\ntransport.  Maintenance of a good road network is vital for the\nagriculture  sector,  which  accounts  for  65  percent  of  total\nemployment  in  Tajikistan.  Roads  provide  the  sector  with\ncrucial  access  to  markets  for  produce  as  well  as  sources  of\ninputs,  and  the  rural  population  with  access  to  economic\nopportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  road  links\nTajikistan\u2019s  third  and  fourth  largest  cities  (Khulyab  and\nKurgan-Tyube)  with  Dushanbe,  the  capital  and  largest  city.\nSince sections of the road were last rehabilitated in the 1970s\nand  are  deteriorating  due \ninadequate  maintenance,\nrehabilitation is necessary to extend the road's useful life.\n\nto \n\n                                                          \n1  Based on draft classification criteria to be applied as part of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy beginning in 2001, the\n\nProject would qualify as a core poverty intervention.\n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nroad; \n\nreducing \n\nincome  by \n\nThe main objective of the Project is to enhance incomes and\nreduce poverty in Khatlon Region by improving road transport\ninfrastructure  and \nthe  creation  of\nthereby  supporting \nproductive  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  (i)\nthe\nincrease \ntransport  costs  on \nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab \n(ii)  provide  agricultural  and\nindustrial  enterprises  with  improved  all-weather  access  to\nmarkets;  (iii)  improve  access  of  the  rural  poor  population  to\nmarkets,  other  economic  opportunities,  and  social  services;\nand (iv) strengthen the Government\u2019s institutional capacity for\nefficient management of the national road network. The scope\nof  the  Project  includes  (i)  rehabilitation  of  approximately  80\nkm  of  the  most  deteriorated  sections  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013\nKhulyab  road,  in  particular,  repair  and  strengthening  of\nembankments,  bridges,  protection  structures,  drainage\nfacilities,  and  pavement;  (ii)  improvement  of  approximately\n150  km  of  rural  roads  including  grading  dirt  road  surfaces,\nbuilding  appropriate  drainage  facilities,  and  surfacing  some\nimportant sections with gravel; (iii) procurement of appropriate\nequipment for road maintenance, laboratory and field material\ntesting,  technical  surveys,  and  design  computerization;  (iv)\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  contract\nmanagement, and training needs assessment; and (v) training\nin  contract  management,  pavement  management  systems,\nand  other  areas  critical  for  maintaining  the  rehabilitated  road\nsections.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $26.8  million\nequivalent (including physical contingencies, price escalation,\nand interest and other charges during construction) consisting\nof  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $18.6  million  and  a  local\ncurrency cost of $8.2 million equivalent.\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent of\nProject Cost\n74.6\n\n10.5\n\n14.9\n\nTotal\nCost\n20.0\n\n2.8\n\n  4.0\n\nSource\n\nADB\n\nGovernment\n\nOPEC Fund\n\nForeign\nExchange\n18.4\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n1.6\n\n2.6\n\n4.0\n\n  0.2\n\n  0.0\n\n18.6\n\nTotal\n\n8.2\n\n26.8\n\n100.0\n\nADB=Asian  Development  Bank,  OPEC=Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting\nCountries.\n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\n31 March 2005\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Transport (MOT)\n\nImplementation Arrangement\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\niv\n\nThe OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund)\nwill provide joint cofinancing of $4 million equivalent for local\ncurrency costs.\n\nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR15,633,000\n($20  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) Special Funds resources will be provided, with a term\nof 32 years including an 8-year grace period, and an interest\ncharge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and\n1.5 percent thereafter.\n\nA project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within\nMOT. A deputy minister will serve as project director and will\nbe  responsible  for  overall  project  management  and  approval\nof contracts and payments. A project manager with adequate\nexperience,  supported  by  a  group  of  qualified  professional\nand  clerical  staff,  will  head  the  PIU  and  be  responsible  for\nday-to-day  project  implementation  activities.

Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $500,000  for\ngoods  and  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international\ncompetitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  through\ninternational  shopping.  Civil  works  for  rehabilitation  of  the\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  have  been  packaged  into  one\ncontract  and  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding\nprocedures.  Civil  works  under  the  rural  road  improvement\ncomponent will be procured under local competitive bidding.\n\nInternational  consulting  services  totaling  75  person-months\nwill  be  provided  for  construction  supervision  (72  person-\nmonths),  and  project  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation  (3\nperson-months).

Over 90 percent of the country is mountainous, and\nmost  of  its  6  million  people  live  in  the  western  part  of  the  country.  Tajikistan  was  one  of  the\npoorest  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  upon  gaining  its  independence  in  1991.\nAlong  with  the  breakup  of  the  trade  and  payments  system  of  the  FSU,  civil  conflict  and  major\nnatural  disasters  since  independence  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  decline  in  economic\nactivity and consequent increase in poverty. The unemployment rate is estimated at 30 percent,\nand  the  poverty  incidence  is  83  percent.1  The  Project  is  located  in  Khatlon  Region  in\nsouthwestern  Tajikistan  and  covers  an  area  of  5,080  square  kilometers  (km)  south  of\nDushanbe,  the  capital  and  largest  city.  The  region  has  a  population  of  2.1  million,  comprising\none third of the country's population, with a poverty incidence of 91 percent. Economic activity in\nKhatlon  Region  is  primarily  agricultural  and  includes  the  growing  of  cotton,  grains,  fruits,  and\nvegetables,  as  well  as  raising  of  livestock.  The  region  accounts  for  over  40  percent  of  the\ncountry's vegetable production, and many agricultural households cultivate fruits and vegetables\non small private plots for self-consumption and to sell in local markets.\n\n3.\nDuring  the  2000  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of\nTajikistan  reconfirmed  its  request  for  ADB  assistance  to  rehabilitate  the  country\u2019s  priority\nnational roads and implement the Project. A project preparatory TA2 was provided to prepare a\ntransport  sector  profile  and  a  road  capital  investment  program,  and  to  carry  out  the  feasibility\nstudy  and  engineering  design  for  the  Project,  which  will  rehabilitate  the  most  deteriorated\nsections of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road (see Map) and improve rural roads. ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding\nand Appraisal missions3 (the Missions) visited Tajikistan from 9 to 22 February 2000 and from 2\nto  23  August  2000,  respectively,  and  agreed  on  a  prioritized  investment  program  for  the  road\nsubsector and the project scope. Project design is based on the TA recommendations, findings\nof  the  Missions,  discussions  with  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultation,  and  coordination\nwith other assistance agencies. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\n                                                          \n1 Based on the State Statistical Agency\u2019s poverty line of TJR20,000 per month.\n2  TA  3168 \u2013TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n3  The Missions comprised J. Miller, Project Economist and Mission Leader; S.Wu, Sr. Project Engineer; L. Campbell,\nSr.  Counsel;  K.  Motomura,  Programs  Officer;  F.  Agnello,  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist;  J.  Wartiovaara,\nEnvironmental Specialist; and S. Wendt, Social Development Specialist.\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nTransport\n\na.\n\nRole of Transport\n\nTransport  plays  a  vital  role  in  Tajikistan's  trade  flows  and  in  the  economy  in  general.\n4.\nTajikistan's  two  most  important  products  are  aluminum  and  cotton,  which  account  for\napproximately 60 percent of the total export value. Production of these goods is dependent on\ntransport for provision of inputs such as alumina and fertilizer, and for access to export markets.\nThe road, railway, and aviation subsectors carry out different transport functions. Roads are the\nprimary means of transport for domestic traffic. Railways are primarily used to ship transit traffic\nbetween regions of Uzbekistan separated by Tajikistan's Leninabad Region and also serve as\nthe main mode for the export of aluminum and cotton fiber. Civil aviation provides an important\nlink for passenger transport over mountain ranges, which divide the country and are impassable\nduring winter.\n\nb. \n\nTraffic\n\ncivil \n\nthe  FSU, \n\nThe  breakup  of \n\n5.\nconflict,  and  major  natural  disasters\nseverely disrupted economic activities and customary trade patterns, and resulted in a dramatic\ndecline in transport demand after Tajikistan gained its independence in 1991 (Appendix 2). Total\nfreight tonnage declined by 92 percent from almost 300 million tons in 1990 to about 23 million\ntons in 1995. Similarly, total freight turnover in ton-km declined by 88 percent from 17.1 billion in\n1990 to 2.1 billion in 1997. The number of passengers declined by 60 percent from 264 million\nin  1992  to  105  million  in  1997;  passenger  turnover  declined  by  73  percent  from  4.5  billion\npassenger-km  in  1992  to  1.2  billion  in  1996.  However,  the  formal  end  to  civil  conflict  in  1997\narrested  the  negative  trend,  and  Tajikistan  has  since  made  significant  progress.  The  positive\neconomic  growth  of  1.7  percent  in  1997,  5.3  percent  in  1998,  and  3.7  percent  in  1999  is\nreflected in rising freight and passenger traffic, which still remains well below pre-independence\nlevels. By most measures, the size of the existing transport infrastructure is therefore adequate\nto accommodate the current and projected levels of economic activity and traffic in the medium\nterm.  The  most  urgent  need  is  to  prioritize  and  carry  out  the  rehabilitation  of  the  most\ndeteriorated segments of the national trunk road network to support economic recovery.\n\n6.\nRoad  transport  is  the  most  important  mode  of  domestic  transport  in  Tajikistan,\naccounting for 67 percent of passenger turnover. Although road transport accounts only for 35\npercent of freight turnover compared with 65 percent for railway transport, 80 to 90 percent of\nrailway  turnover  is  comprised  of  transit  traffic  crossing  northern  Tajikistan.  Since  the  transport\ninfrastructure inherited from the FSU was designed to integrate the republics of the FSU rather\nthan to support the economic development of independent countries, railway traffic between the\nFergana Valley and other regions of Uzbekistan must cross the Leninabad Region in northern\nTajikistan. If such traffic and import freight traffic are excluded, road transport accounts for about\n98  percent  of  freight  volume.  The  railway  network  consists  of  three  unconnected  east-west\nsections: (i) crossing the northern region of Leninabad, (ii) running westward from Dushanbe to\nthe  border  with  Uzbekistan,  and  (iii)  linking  Khulyab  and  other  major  cities  in  Khatlon  Region\nwith Ayvazh near the borders with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan in southwestern Tajikistan. Civil\naviation  accounts  for  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  freight  turnover  and  25  percent  of  the\n\n\f3\n\npassenger  turnover.  The  high  percentage  of  passenger  turnover  is  attributable  to  aviation\nserving  as  the  only  link  between  some  parts  of  Tajikistan  when  winter  weather  results  in  the\nclosure of roads. For example, aviation is the only link between Leninabad Region and the rest\nof Tajikistan for about six months of each year.\n\nc. \n\nTransport Planning and Coordination\n\n7.\nUntil recently, the Transport Department under the Office of the President acted as the\ncentral  point  of  coordination  for  the  transport  sector.  Development  planning  for  the  different\nsubsectors  was  the  responsibility  of  separate  government  organizations.  The  Ministry  of\nTransport  and  Roads  (MOTR)  served  as  the  national  agency  for  road  infrastructure\nmanagement, as well as management of road transport enterprises, including budget allocation,\nwork  assignment,  and  personnel  management.  Tajik  Railway  Company  served  as  the  agency\nfor  railways,  and  Tajikistan  State  Air  Company  for  civil  aviation  and  airports.  Each  of  these\norganizations  was  responsible  for  preparation  of  development  plans  and  investment  programs\nfor  its  own  subsector.  During  implementation  of  the  development  plans,  the  Office  of  the\nPresident  provided  coordination  for  review  and  revision  of  the  investment  programs  and  for\nreallocation of investment funds among the subsectors.\n\n8.\nThe Government\u2019s Transport Sector Policy Statement (TSPS), issued in 1998, outlines\nthe  policy  directive  requiring  development  to  be  based  on  market-oriented  reforms  and\nrestructuring  to  improve  efficiency.  Since  transport  reforms  require  strong  coordination,  the\nTSPS  calls  for  the  creation  of  a  unified  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  overseeing  the  transport\nsector,  with  primary  responsibility  for  formulating  policies  and  regulations  related  to  transport\nservices. The Transport Law, which was enacted by Parliament on 2 October 2000, provided for\nthe establishment of MOT. The Presidential Decrees formally establishing MOT and appointing\nthe Minister of Transport were issued on 25 October 2000.4\n\nd.\n\nInvestments\n\n9.\nPublic investment in transport dropped from about 5 percent of gross domestic product\n(GDP)  in  1990  to  less  than  1  percent  in  1998.  Inadequate  financing  of  the  road  subsector  in\ncombination  with  damage  from  the  civil  conflict  and  major  natural  disasters  led  to  serious\ndeterioration  of  the  physical  condition  of  the  road  network  as  well  as  institutional  and\nmanagement  capacity  in  transport.  Major  reconstruction  will  soon  be  required  for  the  national\ntrunk road network unless adequate funds are secured for rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\n10.\nThe Government is currently operating under a national public investment program (PIP)\nfor 2000-2002, prepared on the basis of the country\u2019s fiscal capability and in consultation with\ndevelopment agencies for possible external financing. The PIP includes 41 projects with a total\ninvestment  of  $551  million  equivalent.  Seven  of  these  are  transport  projects,  including  the\nproposed Project, accounting for about 21 percent of the total investment. The PIP, which was\napproved  in  October  2000,  gives  high  priority  to  the  Project.  The  Government  confirms  that\nadequate counterpart funds for the Project will be allocated in the state budget.\n\n                                                          \n4  As MOT is taking over the functions of MOTR, MOT will henceforth be used to refer to activities of both MOT and\n\nMOTR.\n\n\f4\n\n2. \n\nRoads\n\na. \n\nThe Road Network\n\nThe combined length of Tajikistan\u2019s road network is 26,000 km, consisting of 4,700 km\n11.\nof  national  roads  and  21,300  km  of  local  roads.  The  scope  of  the  network  is  considered\nadequate  to  accommodate  existing  traffic  levels  and  support  economic  recovery  and\nsustainable  development  in  the  medium  term.  Most  of  the  road  network  is  paved,  including\napproximately 90 percent of the national roads and almost 60 percent of the local roads. Of the\npaved roads, about 35 percent are asphalt concrete pavements with the remainder having only\na surface level of pavement. The major part of the network was constructed before 1970, and\ninadequate maintenance and damage from civil conflict and recent natural disasters have left it\nin a state of severe deterioration. MOT has classified 79 percent of the national roads as being\nin  very  poor  condition,  20  percent  in  fair  condition,  and  only  1  percent  in  good  condition.  This\nunderlines the need to rehabilitate the national roads to extend their useful life.\n\nMOT has jurisdiction over 13,600 km, including all of the national roads (4,700 km) and\n12.\n42 percent of the local roads (8,900 km). The remaining 12,400 km are mostly rural and farm\nroads outside MOT\u2019s responsibilities. Most of these were formerly under the jurisdiction of state\nand collective farms, while a few were under the jurisdiction of local governments. Following the\nbreakup  of  the  state  and  collective  farms,  responsibility  for  maintenance  of  the  rural  and  farm\nroads now rests with the local district administrations.\n\nb. \n\nRoad Standards and Safety\n\n13.\nTajikistan\u2019s  road  standards  and  specifications  are  based  on  those  of  the  FSU.  Several\nstudies  have  indicated  that  the  design  standards  of  FSU  state  roads  (national  roads  in\nTajikistan) are sometimes higher than those of the United States or European countries but do\nnot always result in optimum road design. For lower-standard roads, FSU standards for design\nspeed  and  cross  sections  are  similar  to  those  used  in  developing  countries,  but  for  higher-\ncategory roads, they are excessive. The quality of construction of Tajikistan\u2019s roads is generally\ninadequate, mainly because of a lack of cost-effective construction techniques and independent\nconstruction  supervision.  Based  on  a  review  of  road  design  and  construction  standards\nundertaken  under  a  regional  TA5  for  the  three  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  of  Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan,  as  well  as  for  Mongolia,  standards  suitable  for  expected\ntraffic  trends  in  these  countries  were  prepared.  The  TA  findings  and  recommendations  were\ndiscussed  with  the  Government,  which  has  agreed  to  adopt  the  recommended  standards  for\nproject design and construction.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  maintains  road  traffic  accident  information  collected  by\n14.\nthe  traffic  police  force;  however,  to  date  such  information  has  not  been  made  public.  Limited\nroad safety statistics from annual surveys carried out by the Road Traffic Safety Section of MOT\nshow  that  traffic  accidents  decreased  from  1995  to  1999.  However,  poor  traffic  management\nand  road  safety  facilities  were  observed  during  project  processing.  The  Government  is\ncommitted to improving traffic management and road safety facilities such as signs, signals, and\npavement markings, particularly in mountainous road sections.\n\n                                                          \n5  TA 5733-REG: A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997.\n\n\f5\n\nc. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Traffic\n\n15.\nRecent  traffic  surveys  on  the  national  roads  indicate  average  annual  daily  traffic  on\nnonurban roads of 500\u20133,000 vehicles per day, with levels lower than 500 vehicles per day on\nsome  sections.  The  civil  conflict  in  Tajikistan  and  some  neighboring  countries  has  resulted  in\nfrequent closures of Tajikistan's western, northern, and southern borders to most traffic, leaving\nthe  remote  eastern  border  with  the  PRC  as  the  only  fully  open  one.  Traffic  has  also  been\ncurtailed by the high cost and short supply of fuel, almost all of which is imported.\n\n16.\nIn 1998, Tajikistan's vehicle fleet comprised 234,000 vehicles: cars 66 percent, trucks 27\npercent,  buses  4  percent,  and  special  vehicles  3  percent.  Khatlon  Region  accounted  for  21\npercent of Tajikistan\u2019s vehicle fleet. The 37 percent share of trucks of the vehicle fleet registered\nin  Khatlon  Region  is  substantially  higher  than  the  national  average.  Vehicles  in  Tajikistan  are\nmostly old models manufactured in the FSU; many are not fully operational due to the lack of\nspare parts. The maintenance of vehicles and operational transport services is highly dependent\non and limited by the supply of spare parts from other CARs and the Russian Federation.\n\nd. \n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\nIn  1998  the  Government  had  jurisdiction  over  81  road  transport  service  enterprises,\n17.\nmainly  regional  trucking  and  bus  companies,  and  owned  about  80  percent  of  the  trucks  and\nbuses in the country. In 1999, the Government launched a privatization program to separate the\nprovision of transport services. Most transport service enterprises have been corporatized, and\nabout 30 percent of the state-owned vehicle fleet\u2019s trucks and buses have been sold. The bus\nfleet  formerly  controlled  by  MOT,  with  the  exception  of  urban  buses,  is  almost  completely\nprivatized.  Less  progress  has  been  made  in  freight  transport.  MOT's  truck  fleet  is  in  a\ndilapidated  condition,  and  approximately  80  percent  is  idle,  either  because  the  vehicles  are\ninoperable or due to low demand.\n\n18.\nTariffs for passenger and freight transport services are officially set by MOT. The tariffs\nfor urban, suburban, and intercity bus services were increased by 30 percent in 1999. However,\nsince the launching of the privatization program, most of the private road transport enterprises\nare setting their own tariffs. Information obtained in the project area during field visits indicates\nthat tariff levels are indeed flexible and changes in transport costs are passed on to consumers.\nFor  example,  in  the  past  year,  tariffs  have  fluctuated  in  response  to  changes  in  fuel  prices.\nLiberalization of tariff regulations for road transport services is expected with implementation of\nthe new Transport Law, which prescribes commercialization of transport services.\n\ne. \n\nRoad Subsector Revenue and Expenditure\n\n19.\nThe state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to\nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road\nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development\nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road\u2013user taxes, such as excise taxes on\npurchases  of  vehicles  and  parts,  tires,  fuel,  and  lubricants;  (ii)  charges  on  international  transit\nshipments;  (iii)  vehicle  inspection  fees  and  registration  fees;  and  (iv)  contributions  from  local\ngovernments.    In  practice  only  half  of  the  Road  Fund  collection  was  allocated  to  road\nrehabilitation  and  maintenance.  The  other  half  was  used  for  the  construction  of  the  Ushtur\nTunnel  on  the  national  road  connecting  Dushanbe  with  the  northern  region  of  Leninabad  (a\nlong-term  project  requiring  substantial  expenditure)  and  for  the  construction  of  the  railway  line\n\n\f6\n\nfrom  Khulyab  to  Ayvazh  in  southwestern  Tajikistan.  As  a  result,  expenditures  on  road\nrehabilitation and maintenance, shown in Table 1, were much lower than what was needed to\nmaintain the road network at an acceptable level.\n\nTable 1: Expenditures on Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance\n($ million)\n\nItem\nAdministration\nMaintenance\nRepairs\nTotal\nSource: TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, Final Report Phase I, April 2000.\n\n1995\n0.38\n2.12\n0.00\n2.50\n\n1997\n0.60\n2.01\n0.21\n2.82\n\n1996\n0.56\n2.61\n0.00\n3.17\n\n1998\n0.79\n4.96\n0.90\n6.65\n\n1999\n0.62\n4.89\n0.00\n5.51\n\nIn  January  2000  the  Government  terminated  the  Road  Fund  to  meet  the  International\n20.\nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)  requirement \nto  maintain  one  consolidated  state  budget.  Road\nmaintenance  and  construction  are  now  funded  from  the  general  state  budget.  The  combined\nbudget allocation for 2000 is TJR14 billion6 ($7.2 million), of which only 29 percent (TJR4 billion\nor $2.1 million) is for road rehabilitation and maintenance, and 71 percent (TJR10 billion or $5.1\nmillion)  is  for  new  construction,  including  the  Ushtur  Tunnel.  The  allocation  for  road\nrehabilitation and maintenance in 2000 is much below the 1999 expenditure and corresponds to\na funding level of only about $150 per km per year for roads under MOT's jurisdiction (13,600\nkm), or almost $450 per km per year for the national trunk roads (4,700 km), levels insufficient\nfor  even  minimal  maintenance  activities.  MOT  estimates  that  about  $150  million  per  year\n(equivalent  to  an  average  of  about  $11,000  per  km)  would  be  needed  to  rehabilitate  and\nmaintain its road network in acceptable condition. However, the Government cannot afford this\nlevel of expenditure given its fiscal constraints. Until growth of the national economy generates\nadequate revenue, maintaining the road network will be a serious fiscal challenge and external\nfinancial assistance will be necessary to fund road rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\nf.\n\nRoad Administration\n\n21.\nAt  present,  MOT  manages  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  the\nnational road network, as well as some road passenger and freight transport services. MOT has\njurisdiction  over  218  enterprises,  primarily  for  road  construction,  road  maintenance,  and  road\ntransport.7  MOT  also  maintains  the  Road  Design  Institute  and  administers  equipment  repair\nenterprises, road maintenance depots, and industrial enterprises producing concrete structures\nand  castings.  In  1998,  MOT  employed  25,000  staff,  including  engineers,  technicians,  and\nworkers.\n\n22.\nThe administrative structure for the road subsector is undergoing significant change with\nthe  creation  of  a  unified  MOT  with  primary  responsibility  for  overseeing  transport  and\nformulating  policies  and  regulations  related  to  transport  services.  The  Government  has\nproposed  that  MOT  include  two  road  subsector  departments:  the  Road  Infrastructure\nDepartment (RID) and the Road Transport and Safety Department.8 The main responsibilities of\nRID will be (i) preparation of annual and five-year plans for road construction and maintenance,\n                                                          \n6  Tajikistan  introduced  the  somoni  as  its  new  currency  on  30  October  2000.  However,  the  TJR  will  continue  to  be\n\naccepted as legal tender at least until April 2001. 1 somoni = TJR1,000.\n\n7  The enterprises consist of 68 joint-stock companies, 42 state corporations, and 108 state-owned enterprises.\n8  MOT will also include a railroad department and a civil aviation department.\n\n\f7\n\n(ii)  preparation  and  issuance  of  technical  design  standards  for  road  construction  and\nmaintenance, and (iii) preparation of technical standards for quality control and supervision. The\nmain  responsibilities  of  the  Road  Transport  and  Safety  Department  will  be  (i)  formulation  of\nsubsector  policies  and  regulations;  (ii)  issuance  of  licenses  for  road  transport  services;  (iii)\ndevelopment  of  vehicle  technical  standards,  particularly  for  road  traffic  safety  and  the\nenvironment; and (iv) collection and processing of road transport data. Responsibility for design,\nconstruction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure  will  initially  be  retained  by\nthe  Government,  but  will  eventually  be  contracted  to  the  private  sector  once  sufficient  private\nsector  capacity  is  developed.  Market-oriented  reforms  for  the  transport  sector  are  now  being\nintroduced  through  implementation  of  the  ADB-financed  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program9\n(PCIP),  and  a  related  advisory  TA.10    The  organization  structure  proposed  for  MOT  under  the\nTA is in Appendix 3.\n\ng.\n\nConstruction and Maintenance\n\n23.\nTajikistan  has  no  effective  maintenance  planning  and  management  system  to  prioritize\nroad  maintenance,  and  procedures  used  for  road  maintenance  are  outdated  and  need  to  be\nupgraded to international standards. Road construction and maintenance activities on the roads\nunder  MOT's  jurisdiction  are  controlled  by  MOT,  based  on  the  road  subsector  management\nsystem inherited from the FSU. Local construction and maintenance contractors are not allowed\nto compete for work on the roads under MOT's jurisdiction. The maintenance of rural roads is\nthe  responsibility  of  local  governments,  which  may  hire  local  contractors  for  maintenance  and\nrehabilitation work.\n\n24.\nApproximately 100 road construction and maintenance enterprises remain under MOT's\nownership,  while  9  construction  companies  (accounting  for  40  percent  of  the  scope  of\nconstruction works undertaken) have been converted into joint stock companies. Most of MOT's\nroad  construction  and  maintenance  departments  are  organized  as  regional  conglomerates\nconsisting  of  specialized  technical  units,  except  for  those  in  one  region,  which  remain  as\nindividual  entities.  At  present,  MOT  has  limited  capacity  for  contract  administration  and\nconstruction  supervision,  and  still  follows  the  inherited  practice  of  directly  assigning  road\nconstruction and maintenance work to the regional conglomerates, which then assign the work\nto  specific  construction  enterprises  or  maintenance  depots.  The  overall  capacity  of  the\nconglomerates is limited because of inadequate expertise, obsolete equipment, and insufficient\nfinancial resources to perform contractual obligations. The staffing pattern for road maintenance\nis also inefficient with an excess of engineers at the supervisory level and too few maintenance\nworkers.\n\n25.\nThe  Government  intends  to  privatize  road  construction  operations  by  devolving  all\nconstruction-related  activities,  personnel,  and  plant  from  MOT  to  independent  companies;\nhowever, road maintenance will continue to be MOT's responsibility. The Government supports\nADB\u2019s  recommendation  that  a  more  effective,  labor-intensive  road  maintenance  system\nfocusing  on  basic  maintenance  requirements  and  available  financial  resources  be  adopted  to\nadequately maintain the roads to be rehabilitated under the Project. The terms of reference and\nscope of work of the ongoing road maintenance operations need to be redefined as well. The\nconsultants  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2)  developed  a  road  maintenance\n\n                                                          \n9  Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, for $20 million, approved on 10 December 1998.\n10 TA  3114-TAJ: Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and Energy Sectors,  for  $1.5  million,  approved  on  10\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f8\n\nmanual  to  improve  the  road  maintenance  system.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in\nstrengthening  the  planning,  management,  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  through\nconsulting services under the advisory TA (paras. 69 to 72).\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n26.\nThe  Government's  policies  are  currently  in  transition.  Since  the  formal  end  to  the  civil\nconflict in 1997, the Government has been trying to improve delivery of various social services\nand  has  committed  to  maintaining  a  budget  allocation  of  37  percent  for  social  sector\nexpenditures.  In  March  2000,  the  Government  launched  the  drafting  of  a  poverty  reduction\nstrategy paper with the World Bank and IMF, and created a special working group to begin work\non  a  national  poverty  reduction  strategy.  This  working  group  includes  leading  academics  and\nministerial  representatives,  and  is  scheduled  to  complete  its  assignment  in  the  first  quarter  of\n2001.  Based  on  the  Government\u2019s  request  and  on  discussions  with  major  stakeholders,  ADB\nwill assist in drafting the national poverty reduction strategy and developing a poverty monitoring\nmechanism.\n\n27.\nThe  Government\u2019s  transport  strategy  and  development  plans  are  reflected  in  the  PIP\nand  TSPS.  The  strategic  objective  is  to  establish  an  efficient  transport  system  that  provides\naffordable services to the nation, is responsive to the changes in the economy, and meets the\nneeds of the country through efficient allocation of scarce resources. The approach to achieve\nthe  objective  consists  of  (i)  establishing  a  policy  and  regulatory  environment  conducive  to  the\noperation of a market-based transport system; (ii) improving sector management by limiting the\nGovernment\u2019s  role  to  policymaking  and  sector  regulation;  (iii)  improving  corporate  governance\nand encouraging private sector participation; (iv) establishing appropriate funding mechanisms\nand  adopting  market  pricing  and  user-pay  principles;  (v)  promoting  regional  intermodal\ntransport; (vi) improving safety and environmental standards; and (vii) recognizing the interests\nof disadvantaged groups and providing targeted support to them.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Subsector\n\nThe major sources of external assistance to the road subsector are ADB, World Bank,\n28.\nIslamic Development Bank (IDB), Aga Khan Foundation, and Kuwait Fund. External assistance\nto the road subsector began in 1997, and the cumulative commitments totaled $22.8 million as\nof  August  2000.  External  assistance  has  been  limited  to  small-scale  construction  of  missing\nlinks  and  emergency  repair  of  roads  and  bridges  destroyed  by  the  civil  conflict  and  natural\ndisasters.  No  major,  direct  support  has  been  provided  for  road  rehabilitation.  The  Mission\nconfirmed that the Project does not overlap with other assistance activities for roads.\n\nThe first two loans by ADB to Tajikistan addressed transport needs. The PCIP (footnote\n29.\n9) and the related TA (footnote 10) have facilitated transport reforms in the areas of legislation,\nrestructuring of transport management, and enhancement of cost recovery mechanisms for road\noperation and maintenance. The more recent Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project11 includes\n$1.1 million for rehabilitation of small road sections and bridges.\n\n30.\nThe World Bank has provided a total of $8.8 million for emergency repair of roads and\nbridges  in  war-torn  areas  as  part  of  a  larger  credit  in  1998  and  a  $5  million  emergency  flood\nrehabilitation credit in 1999. IDB committed $10 million in 2000 to finance construction of a road\n\n                                                          \n11 Loan 1714-TAJ: Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $5 million, approved on 2 December 1999.\n\n\f9\n\nlink from Murgab to Kulma Pass on the border with the PRC in eastern Tajikistan. IDB and the\nKuwait  Fund  have  provided  a  total  of  $1  million  to  construct  the  missing  link  of  the  Khulyab\u2013\nKalaikhum  road  and  to  carry  out  a  feasibility  study  for  upgrading  the  road.  The  Aga  Khan\nFoundation  provided  $1.1  million  during  1997-2000  to  repair  roads  and  bridges  in  the  Gorno-\nBadakhshan  Autonomous  Region.  Assistance  agencies  have  been  active  in  other  transport\nareas as well. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provided a $3.9 million\ngrant to rehabilitate  the  runway at the Dushanbe airport and a $5.0 million loan to rehabilitate\nthe Khujand airport. The European Union, IDB, and the Aga Khan Foundation have provided TA\ngrants totaling about $0.5 million for transport sector studies.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB  has  no  previous  experience  with  large-scale  projects  in  the  transport  sector  in\n31.\nTajikistan. However, implementation of the PCIP, Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, and\nseveral TAs indicates that (i) absorptive capacity is limited because of the tight fiscal situation;\n(ii) the administrative structure is inefficient and has limited capacity for policy formulation and\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  knowledge  and  appreciation  of  ADB\u2019s  policies,  procedures,  and\npractices  is  limited.  To  address  these  difficulties,  the  Project  will  strengthen  Tajikistan\u2019s\nabsorptive  and  implementation  capacity  through  consulting  services  under  the  advisory  TA\n(paras.  69  to  72),  which  will  familiarize  senior  Government  officials  with  ADB\u2019s  operational\npolicies and procedures, and provide on-the-job training and human resource development for\nthe Executing Agency. ADB has also drawn on the experience of other assistance agencies in\nimplementing  programs  and  projects  in  Tajikistan.  Their  experience  indicates  that  effective\nassistance requires project ownership and proactive involvement of senior Government officials\nin the process of decision making, a high level of commitment by staff, and adequate delegation\nof  authority.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  experience  of  ADB  and  other  agencies  have  been\nincorporated in the project design.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n32.\nThe  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  interim  operational  strategy  for  Tajikistan  are  to  facilitate  the\ncountry\u2019s transition to a market economy, assist in postconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction,\nand provide support for natural disaster rehabilitation and prevention. The strategy focuses on\nthree priority areas: (i) agriculture and agroprocessing; (ii) infrastructure rehabilitation, especially\nfor  roads  and  power;  and  (iii)  education,  health,  and  social  protection.  ADB\u2019s  operations  will\npromote  development  of  small  and  medium-size  enterprises  and  assist  in  reducing  poverty,\nparticularly for households headed by women and communities in remote mountainous areas.\n\n33.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  transport  sector  aims  to  promote  growth  by  removing  policy,\ninstitutional,  financial,  and  physical  impediments  to  the  delivery  of  efficient  transport  services.\nThis  will  be  achieved  by  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  transport  reform  agenda  and  providing\nfinancial  resources  to  rehabilitate  the  rapidly  deteriorating  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  transport\nprogram for 2001\u20132003 will support the ongoing economic transition to a market economy by (i)\nhelping  the  Government  develop  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  framework  to  foster\neconomic  development,  (ii)  facilitating  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  to  improve\nefficiency, (iii) promoting competition and private sector participation in the provision of transport\nservices,  (iv)  improving  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries,  (v)  improving  cost  recovery\nmechanisms for road operation and maintenance, (vi) rehabilitating basic infrastructure, and (vii)\ndeveloping human resources.\n\n\fF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n10\n\n34.\nThe  ongoing  PCIP  (footnote  9)  includes  a  comprehensive  agenda  for  transport  policy\ndialogue  and  reforms.  The  policy  reform  and  institutional  restructuring  initiatives  include  (i)\nintroducing an adequate sector legal framework, (ii) establishing a single policymaking body for\nthe  entire  sector  to  improve  its  management,  and  (iii)  identifying  and  addressing  institutional\nconstraints on human resource development. Although PCIP implementation experienced some\ndelays, by October 2000 the two transport-related core policy conditions for the second tranche\nrelease  were met. A review  of the  present road financing and cost recovery mechanisms was\ncompleted in December 1999, and the Transport Law introducing market-oriented reforms in the\nsector  was  enacted  on  2  October  2000.12  The  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the  transport-\nrelated core policy conditions provides the foundation for future transport sector reform, to which\nthe  Government  is  committed.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  for  the  Project  has  built  on  the  progress\nmade  under  the  PCIP  and  focused  on  (i)  facilitating  implementation  of  the  Transport  Law,  (ii)\nrevising  the  TSPS  to  reflect  the  latest  reforms  stipulated  in  the  Transport  Law,  (iii)  improving\ngovernance  and  sector  management,  and  (iv)  formulating  strategies  to  enhance  user  charges\nfor  road  operation  and  maintenance.  A  summary  of  the  agreements  reached  with  the\nGovernment  follows.  An  action  plan  for  implementing  the  Transport  Law,  improving  corporate\ngovernance, and addressing the social costs of the reform process is given in Appendix 4.\n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Regulatory Framework\n\n35.\nThe reforms introduced by the Transport Law will need to be implemented through a set\nof  regulations  and  guidelines.  The  main  objectives  are  to  (i)  separate  Government  functions\nfrom those that can be performed by the private sector as commercial operations, (ii) promote\ncompetition and enhance private sector participation, (iii) privatize state-owned enterprises, and\n(iv) develop road safety and environmental standards that comply with international standards.\nThe  implementing  regulations  and  guidelines  will  be  formulated  with  the  assistance  of  the\nadvisory TA (paras. 69 to 72). The Government has agreed that the TSPS issued in 1998 will be\nreviewed and updated to reflect recent progress in policy reforms and sector development. The\nGovernment is expected to adopt the revised TSPS by the end of 2001.\n\n2. \n\nOrganization and Strengthening of MOT\n\n36.\nThe Transport Law provides for the establishment of a unified MOT covering all transport\nsubsectors  to  improve  the  accountability  and  efficiency  of  management  and  operations  in  the\nsector (para. 22). Substantial work will be required to help MOT reach its envisioned capacity.\nThe advisory TA will assist in developing MOT\u2019s institutional capacity to effectively carry out its\npolicymaking  and  regulatory  responsibilities  in  a  market  environment,  monitor  policy  and\nprogram implementation, and conduct efficient program and project management.\n\n3.\n\n Private Sector Development\n\nThe  TSPS  emphasizes  facilitating  the  privatization  of  road  transport  enterprises,  and\n37.\nreplacing  the  current  road  management  system  in  which  the  Government  owns  the  road\nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  transport  enterprises  (para.  21).    While  some  progress  has\n                                                          \n12 Originally, the second tranche release under the PCIP was scheduled for December 1999, subject to compliance\nwith 11 core policy conditions (1 related to foreign investment, 2 to the transport sector, and 8 to the energy sector).\nThe  delay  has  been  mainly  attributable  to  a  series  of  elections  in  the  first  half  of  2000  that  slowed  work  by  the\nexecutive and legislative branches of the Government.\n\n\f11\n\nbeen  made  in  corporatizing  and  privatizing  transport  service  enterprises,  substantial  work\nremains,  and  the  process  must  be  expanded  to  include  road  construction  and  maintenance\nenterprises.  To  facilitate  progress,  assistance  will  be  needed  to  improve  the  legal  framework,\ncorporate governance, commercial operation procedures, and accounting systems of the state-\nowned enterprises. A summary action plan for commercializing road subsector enterprises has\nbeen prepared under the PCIP-related TA (footnote 10). The Government has agreed that due\nattention and resources will be allocated to implement the action plan, and agreed to privatize at\nleast 25 percent of state-owned road transport enterprises by project completion. The advisory\nTA  will  facilitate  commercialization  and  privatization  of  road  transport  enterprises,  and  help\ndevelop the capacity of the private sector to carry out road construction and maintenance.\n\n4.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n38.\nADB has carried out policy dialogue with the Government on the provision of counterpart\nfunds for the Project and through this dialogue is helping the Government rationalize the budget.\nThe Government recognizes the importance of providing counterpart funds in a timely manner\nand will ensure that sufficient budget allocations are provided for the counterpart funds.\n\n5.\n\nUser Charges and Financing of Road Maintenance\n\n39.\nTajikistan  faces  major  problems  with  cost  recovery  in  the  road  subsector  and  with\nproviding  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance.  Prior  to  2000,  road  maintenance  was\nfinanced in large part by revenues from the Road Fund (para 19). However, the Road Fund was\nterminated in January 2000, and the budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance\nfor  2000  is  well  below  the  1999  expenditure  (para.  20).  The  current  allocation  is  too  low  to\nmaintain the road network at an acceptable level. In addition, the fact that budget allocations for\nroad  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  vary  substantially  from  year  to  year  makes  long-term\nplanning of maintenance difficult.\n\n40.\nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  carried  out  with  the  Government  on  the  need  for  adequate\nfunding of road maintenance, and ADB is continuing policy dialogue with the Government and\nIMF on reinstatement of the Road Fund. As both maintenance and construction are covered by\nthe  same  budget  allocation,  the  Missions  emphasized  the  need  to  give  higher  priority  to  road\nmaintenance than to construction of new roads and tunnels, which receives a substantial portion\nof  the  combined  budget  allocation.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  budget\nallocation for maintenance and rehabilitation, excluding new construction, of roads under MOT\u2019s\njurisdiction will increase by 10 percent per year in real terms during 2002\u20132004; (ii) funding for\nroad  maintenance  will  comprise  no  less  than  50  percent  of  the  budget  allocation  for  road\nmaintenance  and  construction  in  2001,  increasing  to  70  percent  in  2004;  and  (iii)  sufficient\nbudget allocations are provided for maintenance of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road and rural roads\nincluded in the Project. To address the long-term funding of road maintenance, the advisory TA\nwill review the current road\u2013user charges and recommend more effective measures to increase\nroad revenue in order to recover the costs of operation and maintenance. The TA will also help\nthe  Government  prioritize  road  network  maintenance  and  optimize  utilization  of  scarce\nresources.\n\n\f12\n\n6.\n\nCapacity Building and Institutional Strengthening\n\n41.\nThe Government\u2019s institutional capacity for implementing policy reforms, particularly for\nimproving  governance  and  management,  is  weak.  Capacity  building  is  urgently  required  at  all\nlevels  to  improve  administrative  structures,  procedures,  technology,  skills,  and  management.\nThis  will  be  a  long-term  process  and  will  involve  defining  new  structures  and  procedures,  and\nupdating technology and skills. ADB has assisted the Government through the PCIP-related TA\n(footnote 10) in the institutional strengthening of the transport and energy sectors, particularly in\nimproving the legal framework and restructuring sector management. The consultants identified\nthe following areas as requiring immediate attention: (i) project costing and financial accounting;\n(ii)  project  feasibility  study  methodology  and  technical  design;  (iii)  project  management  and\nquality control; and (iv) road maintenance planning, financing, and administration. The advisory\nTA  will  identify  specific  measures  to  be  implemented  in  these  areas  to  strengthen  institutional\ncapacity in economic and financial analysis and road maintenance financing (paras. 69 to 72).\nIn addition, the international consultants under the Project will help build capacity by helping the\nGovernment  identify  appropriate  international  training  programs  on  road  maintenance  and\nmanagement planning for MOT staff.\n\n7. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n42.\nPoverty  reduction  is  a  key  component  of  Government  policy,  and  ADB  is  assisting  the\nGovernment  in  drafting  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  in  developing  a  poverty\nmonitoring mechanism (para. 26). Policy dialogue for the Project emphasizes poverty reduction\nthrough the Government agreement (i) to include rural road rehabilitation in the Project and (ii)\non  selection  criteria  for  rural  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  (para.  50).  Reforms  facilitating\ncommercialization  and  privatization  of  transport  enterprises  (para.  37)  will  also  help  reduce\npoverty by ensuring that transport cost savings are passed on to transport users.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n43.\nThe  improvement  of  road  transport  services  is  vital  for  economic  development  and\npoverty reduction in Tajikistan, which is the poorest country among the CARs. The breakup of\nthe  FSU,  civil  conflict,  and  major  natural  disasters  have  resulted  in  a  dramatic  decline  of\neconomic activity and increase in poverty. Poverty incidence is currently estimated at 91 percent\nin  the  project  area  and  83  percent  in  Tajikistan  overall.  Rehabilitation  of  the  country\u2019s  road\ninfrastructure  is  necessary  to  sustain  the  economic  recovery  now  under  way  and  to  reduce\npoverty.  Roads  are  the  most  important  mode  of  domestic  freight  and  passenger  transport.\nMaintenance  of  a  good  road  network  is  vital  for  the  agriculture  sector,  which  accounts  for  65\npercent  of  total  employment  in  Tajikistan.  Roads  provide  the  agriculture  sector  with  crucial\naccess to markets for produce as well as sources of inputs, and the rural population with access\nto economic opportunities and social services.\n\n44.\nThe  project  road  links  Tajikistan\u2019s  third  and  fourth  largest  cities  (Khulyab  and  Kurgan\u2013\nTyube) with Dushanbe, the capital and largest city. The existing railway line in Khatlon Region\ndoes  not  link  the  project  area  to  Dushanbe.  Since  large  sections  of  the  250  km  Dushanbe\u2013\nKhulyab  road  were  last  rehabilitated  in  the  early  1970s  and  are  in  a  deteriorated  state  due  to\ninadequate maintenance, rehabilitation is necessary to extend the road's useful life.\n\n\f13\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of the Project is to enhance incomes and reduce poverty in Khatlon\n45.\nRegion by improving road transport infrastructure and thereby support the creation of productive\nemployment opportunities. The Project will (i) increase incomes by reducing transport costs on\nthe  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road;  (ii)  provide  agricultural  and  industrial  enterprises  with  improved\nall-weather  access  to  markets;  (iii)  improve  access  of  the  rural  poor  population  to  social\nservices,  markets,  and  other  economic  opportunities;  and  (iv)  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s\ninstitutional capacity for efficient management of the national road network.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\n46.\n\nThe scope of the Project includes\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nrehabilitation  of  approximately  80  km  of  the  most  deteriorated  sections  of  the\nDushanbe\u2013Khulyab road, in particular, repair and strengthening of embankment,\nbridges, protection structures, drainage facilities, and pavement;\n\nimprovement of approximately 150 km of rural roads including grading dirt road\nsurfaces,  building  appropriate  drainage  facilities,  and  surfacing  some  important\nsections with gravel;\n\nprocurement of appropriate equipment for road maintenance, laboratory and field\nmaterial testing, technical surveys, and design computerization;\n\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  and\ntraining needs assessment; and\n\ntraining  in  contract  management,  pavement  management  systems,  and  other\nareas critical for maintaining the rehabilitated road sections.\n\n47.\nIf the Project is approved, an advisory TA for institutional and policy support to the road\nsubsector,  including  development  of  a  road  maintenance  strategy  and  associated  procedures,\nwill be provided.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\nThe Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road was constructed in the 1950s and was last rehabilitated in\n48.\nthe  early  1970s.  Inadequate  maintenance  and  severe  weather  conditions  have  resulted  in\nserious deterioration and damage. In winter, heavy snowfalls and avalanches block the road. In\nspring  and  summer,  melting  snow  and  rainfall  cause  frequent  rockfalls  and  landslides,  which\noften  make  the  road  impassable.  The  road  traverses  several  passes  at  elevations  exceeding\n2,500 m and presents difficult driving conditions in its current deteriorated state. Rehabilitation\nof  the  road  is  urgently  required  to  prevent  irreversible  degradation.  The  rehabilitation  will\naddress the defects of the road infrastructure by repairing and strengthening the embankment,\nroad  structures,  drainage  facilities,  and  pavement.  The  Project,  which  is  ADB\u2019s  first  major\nintervention for rehabilitation of priority roads in Tajikistan, will ensure all-weather road transport\nservices on the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road.\n\n\f14\n\nAverage  annual  daily  traffic  on  most  of  the  road  sections  ranges  between  1,000  and\n49.\n3,000 vehicles at present. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the sections that\nwill be rehabilitated (Appendix 5). The forecasts cover 2001\u20132024 and are based on expected\ngrowth in GDP and population, and the income elasticity of demand for freight and passenger\ntransport. Some additional traffic is expected to be generated as a result of lower transport costs\narising  from  the  Project.    The  forecast  average  annual  growth  rates  for  total  traffic  are  6.6\npercent  during  2001-2006  and  5.7  percent  thereafter,  resulting  in  traffic  levels  ranging  from\n1,400 to 2,900 in 2001 and from 5,400 to 10,800 in 2024. The number of passenger vehicles is\nexpected to grow at a slightly higher rate than that of freight vehicles.\n\n50.\nThe  rural  road  improvement  component  linked  to  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  will\ncomprise basic restoration of the roads, including dressing surfaces with gravel. The rural roads\nto  be  included  in  the  Project  will  be  identified  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  agreed\nselection  criteria  focusing  on  poverty  and  social  considerations,  traffic  levels,  costs  and\neconomic returns, the road maintenance capability of the local governments, and links to other\nADB  projects  in  the  area  (Appendix  6).  Farmers  in  the  project  area  and  local  health  and\neducation officials will be consulted in the selection process.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n51.\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $26.8  million  equivalent  (including  physical\ncontingencies,  price  escalation,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  but\nexcluding taxes) 13, of which $18.6 million (69.4 percent) is the foreign exchange cost. The local\ncurrency costs are estimated at  $8.2 million equivalent (30.6 percent). The cost estimates are\nsummarized in Table 2 and shown in Appendix 7.\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\na.  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab Road Rehabilitation\n\nItem\nA.  Base Costs\n\n1.

The Government has given its assurance that\nif the amendment is not passed and any taxes are imposed, the Government will cover the cost of any such taxes.\n\n\fE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n15\n\n52.\nThe Government has requested ADB to provide a loan from its Special Funds resources\nin  an  amount  equivalent  to  $20  million  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost,  except  for\ninterest during construction charges on the OPEC Fund cofinancing, and $1.6 million equivalent\nof  the  local  currency  costs  of  the  Project.  The  ADB  loan  represents  74.6  percent  of  the  total\nproject cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years\nand  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter. ADB financing of a portion of local costs is justified due to the Government's\nbudgetary  constraints,  a  heavy  external  debt  burden,  and  Tajikistan's  severe  poverty.  The\nbudget  deficit  was  4  percent  of  GDP  in  1999  despite  improvements  in  tax  collection  and\nconstraints  on  expenditure.  Tajikistan's  external  debt  is  97.2  percent  of  GDP,  and  its  debt\nburden in 1999 was 3 percent of GDP. The current account deficit in 2000 is expected to be 5.7\npercent  of  GDP,  and  gross  official  reserves  in  October  2000  represent  only  1.9  months  of\nimports.  The  OPEC  Fund  will  provide  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $4  million  to  finance  the  local\ncosts of the rehabilitation works on the Dushanbe-Khulyab road on a joint basis with ADB.  The\nOPEC Fund cofinancing will have a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years, an\ninterest  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum,  and  a  service  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum.  The\nGovernment will finance $0.2 million of foreign exchange costs for interest during construction\non  the  OPEC  Fund  cofinancing  and  $2.6  million  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs,  or  10.5\npercent of the total project cost. The Government has given its assurance that adequate local\ncounterpart funds will be made available from the state budget or other sources as necessary to\nenable  the  Project  to  be  implemented  in  a  timely  manner.  The  proposed  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 3 and shown in Appendix 7.\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\nADB\nGovernment\nOPEC Fund\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n18.4\n  0.2\n  0.0\n18.6\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n1.6\n2.6\n4.0\n8.2\n\nTotal\nCost\n20.0\n  2.8\n  4.0\n26.8\n\nPercent of\nProject Cost\n74.6\n10.5\n14.9\n100.0\n\nADB=Asian Development Bank, OPEC=Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n53.\nAs  the  Executing  Agency,  MOT  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management\nincluding planning, managing, supervising, and coordinating implementation. Within MOT, RID\nwill  form  a  project  implementation  unit  to  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  project\nimplementation  activities.  RID  has  obtained  relevant  experience  from  implementing  projects\nassisted by the World Bank and IDB, and by participating in the ADB-financed PCIP (footnote\n9). However, its capacities in financial accounting and contract administration are still weak and\nwill be strengthened through consulting services for construction supervision and training, and\nthrough the advisory TA.\n\n\f16\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nOrganization and Management\n\nAn MOT deputy minister will be the project director with overall responsibility for project\n54.\nmanagement,  including  approval  of  contracts  and  payments.  The  project  implementation  unit\nwill  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal\napplications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress  reports,  and  (iv)  maintain  project  accounts  and\ncomplete loan financial records for auditing the Project. A project manager, acceptable to ADB,\nwith adequate experience will head the implementation unit and be responsible for supervision\nof specific implementation activities. The manager will be supported by a group of professional\nand  clerical  staff  with  expertise  and  experience  in  financial  accounting,  road  engineering,\nconstruction supervision, and contract administration.\n\n2. \n\nSecurity and Safety of Project Implementation\n\nTajikistan  has  suffered  from  civil  conflict  and  political  instability  since  independence,\n55.\nalthough  the  situation  has  improved  recently.  ADB  concluded  a  special  agreement  with  the\nUnited Nations (UN) in August 1999 to include ADB missions under the UN security umbrella.\nSince then, ADB\u2019s activities outside Dushanbe have been subject to UN security clearance. This\narrangement  will  remain  valid  for  all  ADB  missions,  consultants,  and  contractors  under  the\nProject.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n56.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  slightly  less  than  four  years  from  January  2001  to\nSeptember 2004 including preconstruction activities. The civil works for the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab\nroad are scheduled to begin in October 2001 and be completed in September 2004. The rural\nroad  improvement  component  will  be  implemented  in  one  year  from  May  2002  to  April  2003.\nThe implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\n57.\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and\nequipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts\nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  through  international\nshopping. Civil works for rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road have been packaged into\none  contract  and  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  encourage\nparticipation  of  international  contractors  and  joint  ventures  of  international  and  domestic\ncontractors.  Civil  works  under  the  rural  road  improvement  component  will  be  financed\ncompletely by the Government and will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures.\nTentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 9.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n58.\nInternational  consulting  services  totaling  75  person-months  will  be  required  for\nconstruction  supervision  (72  person-months),  and  project  impact  monitoring  and  evaluation  (3\nperson-months).  The  international  consultants  will  also  provide  on-the-job  training  to  the\ncounterpart  staff  and  will  assist  MOT  in  the  identification  of  appropriate  overseas  training\n\n\f17\n\nprograms  in  road  maintenance  planning  and  management.  In  addition  to  the  international\nconsultants, domestic consulting services (810 person-months) will be provided for construction\nsupervision,  contract  management,  and  other  advisory  TA.  An  additional  15  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting services will be required to assist the international consultants in monitoring\nthe social and poverty impacts of the Project through household surveys and data analysis. The\nGovernment  has  asked  that  the  internationally  recruited  consultants  collaborate  with  the\ndomestic consultants and ADB has agreed to this request. The consultants will be financed by\nADB  and  the  Government  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The terms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 10.\n\n6.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n59.\nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  in\n2002.  The  review  will  focus  on  the  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,\nenvironmental,  social,  and  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  Project\u2019s  economic\nviability and other relevant aspects that may affect its performance will also be assessed during\nthe review. The review will examine the implementation progress for the sector reforms, policy\ndevelopment, and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement.\n\n7.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n60.\nMOT will prepare and submit to ADB and the OPEC Fund quarterly progress reports on\nproject  implementation,  the  form  and  content  of  which  will  be  agreed  to  by  ADB.  MOT  will\nmaintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB, the OPEC Fund, and\nthe Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor with adequate knowledge of\nand experience with international accounting practices acceptable to ADB. The audited project\naccounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be furnished to ADB within nine months after the end of\neach  fiscal  year.  The  Government  has  been  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely\nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the  suspension  of\ndisbursements  in  case  of  noncompliance.  To  facilitate  project  postevaluation,  the  Government\nhas  agreed  to  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion  report  within  three  months  of  physical\ncompletion of the Project.\n\n8.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n61.\nA set of indicators to evaluate project performance in relation to project goals, purposes,\noutputs,  and  conditions  has  been  agreed  with  the  Government,  as  shown  in  the  project\nperformance management system in Appendix 11. Baseline indicators and target values will be\nestablished by MOT when the rehabilitation commences. Subsequently, indicator values will be\nobserved  during  project  implementation,  at  project  completion,  one  year  after  project\ncompletion, and two years after project completion. The monitoring system will cover the social\nand  poverty  impacts  of  the  road  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  the  rural  roads,  and  will\nprovide  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis  of  the  income  levels  of  the  rural  poor,  and  the\ndistribution  of  project  benefits  to  the  poor.  These  aspects  of  the  monitoring  system  will  be\ncaptured  through  social  and  household  surveys,  public  consultation,  and  participation  of  the\nproject beneficiaries. The Government has agreed to recruit an international consultant to help\nestablish  the  monitoring  system,  and  to  provide  training  in  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  MOT\ncounterpart staff.\n\n\f18\n\n9.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n62.\nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  officials  of  the  Government  by  the\nMissions. ADB has helped Tajikistan improve governance and reduce the scope for corruption.\nADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  Tajikistan,  the  PCIP  (footnote  9),  addressed  a  range  of  governance\nissues including reform of the legal framework and government structures, and improvement of\nefficiency  of  subsector  management.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve\ngovernance,  ADB\u2019s  2001\u20132003  country  assistance  program  includes  four  TAs  to  improve  aid\nand debt management and build capacity for the legal system and corporate governance. ADB\nhelped prepare the bidding and contract documents for procurement of works and equipment,\nand  recruitment  of  consultants  based  on  the  requirements  and  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines\nand  in  line  with  the  anticorruption  policy  (footnote  2).  The  advisory  TA  will  strengthen  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  detect  and  address  fraud  and  corruption  by  helping  (i)  formulate\nGovernment  financial  accounting  standards  and  procedures,  (ii)  develop  Government  auditing\nprocedures, and (iii) implement a training program on project auditing to ensure full compliance\nwith  the  auditing  procedures  by  Government  auditors  (paras.  69  to  72).  The  Government  is\ncommitted to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment, and has agreed to abide by\nthe relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in preparing all documents and contracts\nduring the bidding process and during project implementation.\n\n10.\n\nCapacity Building and Human Resource Development\n\n63.\n About 24 person-months of international training programs are included to develop MOT\nstaff  capacity  in  the  fields  of  bridge  maintenance,  pavement  management  systems,  contract\nmanagement  and  quality  control,  and  maintenance  planning  and  equipment  depot\nmanagement.  In  addition,  the  construction  supervision  consultants  will  provide  on-the-job\ntraining for MOT staff and domestic consultants in subjects such as international standards and\nskills  for  laboratory  and  field  material  testing,  technical  surveys  and  design  standards,\nenvironmental  monitoring,  measurement  and  certification  of  works,  and  progress  reporting.\nMOT, with the assistance of the international consultants, will prepare for ADB\u2019s concurrence a\ntraining  plan  including  a  program  of  courses  and  lists  of  candidates  to  be  trained.  Workshops\nand seminars will be organized by those trained to disseminate what they have learned through\nthe training courses.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nThe  project  classification \n\nis  Environment  Category  B.  An \n\n64.\ninitial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out under the project preparatory TA in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures,\nand Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that there\nwill  be  no  major  adverse  environmental  impact  because  the  Project  involves  mainly\nrehabilitation of roads on the existing alignment (except for minor realignments to improve road\nsafety) and will not require any land acquisition.\n\n65.\nAppropriate mitigation measures have been incorporated in the project design, including\nadequate drainage facilities, erosion prevention measures, and traffic management facilities, as\nwell as planting of vegetation to protect the landscape and prevent landslides. The consultants\nfor construction supervision will assist MOT in supervising and monitoring the implementation of\n\n\f19\n\n(i)  selection  and  restoration  of  borrow  areas  and  quarries,  (ii)  extraction  of  water  for\nconstruction,  (iii)  waste  management,  (iv)  control  of  chemical  materials,  and  (v)  prevention  of\nimpairment  of  downstream  water  quality.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will\nadequately  address  any  adverse  environmental  impact  of  the  Project.  A  summary  IEE  for  the\nProject is included as Appendix 12.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Impact\n\n66.\nTajikistan  is  the  poorest  country  among  the  CARs,  with  a  per  capita  GDP  of  $370  in\n199814 and poverty incidence of 83 percent. The project is located in Khatlon Region, which has\na poverty incidence of 91 percent. Agriculture is the dominant economic activity and the largest\nsource  of  income  and  employment.  The  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  traverses  seven  rayons\n(districts) with approximately 400,000 inhabitants, most of whom live within 20 km of the road.\nOf these inhabitants, 70 percent live in rural areas where the incidence of poverty is particularly\nsevere.  The  project  design  contains  measures  to  extend  socioeconomic  benefits  to  the  poor.\nThese  include  improvement  of  priority  rural  roads  to  facilitate  access  to  input  and  output\nmarkets for the rural population. The rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road will provide\nmore  reliable  transport  linkages  to  the  regional  trade  centers  and  bigger  cities,  where  the\nfarmers and local producers can sell their products at higher prices than in local markets.\n\n67.\nKey  social  issues  were  analyzed  during  the  social  analysis  conducted  as  part  of  the\nfeasibility  study  and  developed  during  project  processing  missions.  A  summary  social  impact\nassessment  is  included  in  Appendix  13.  The  Project  will  have  no  resettlement  effects.  The\nProject will have no particular adverse impact on vulnerable groups and no negative implication\nfor gender concerns or indigenous people.\n\nThe Project will contribute to reducing poverty in the project impact area and in Khatlon\n68.\nregion (paras. 75 to 81). The improvement of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road and associated rural\nroads  will  reduce  transport  costs,  improve  access  to  markets  and  social  services,  and  reduce\ndamage to agricultural produce. The Project will generate short-term employment opportunities\nthrough the road rehabilitation itself, and also long-term employment through increased funding\nfor  road  maintenance.  The  Project's  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  poverty  reduction,\nsocial  development,  and  women,  will  be  monitored  during  and  after  implementation.  A  set  of\nbaseline indicators for monitoring project impacts was incorporated in the project performance\nmonitoring system (para. 61).\n\nI.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nThe Government\u2019s capacity to formulate market-oriented policy and regulations as well\n69.\nas  operational  guidelines  for  the  road  subsector  needs  considerable  strengthening.  The\ncapacity building should include defining new structures and procedures, introducing up-to-date\ntechnology  and  skills,  and  improving  administrative  accountability  and  efficiency.  Under  the\nADB-financed PCIP (footnote 9) and the associated TA (footnote 10), assistance was provided\nto  the  Government  to  improve  the  legal  framework,  restructure  transport  sector  management,\nand  identify  critical  institutional  constraints  that  impede  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s\npolicy  and  reform  initiatives.  To  facilitate  subsector  development  and  support  successful\n\n                                                          \n14  Per  capita  gross  national  product  levels  in  1998  in  other  CARs  were  $1,340  in  Kazakhstan,  $380  in  the  Kyrgyz\n\nRepublic, and $950 in Uzbekistan (World Bank. Atlas 2000. Washington, DC.)\n\n\f20\n\neconomic transition, the Government has requested ADB to provide TA focusing on institutional\ncapacity  building  and  policy  support  to  the  road  subsector.  The  advisory  TA  will  assist  the\nGovernment  in  developing  capacity  building  strategies  and  implementing  a  capacity  building\nprogram for the road subsector based on the findings and recommendations of the PCIP-related\nTA (footnote 10). It will also provide a vehicle to engage the Government in an in-depth review\nof  the  policy  reform  initiatives  under  the  PCIP  and  help  the  Government  with  the  appropriate\ntechnology and skills to efficiently manage development of the road subsector.\n\nThe advisory TA will help the Government (i) update the TSPS to reflect the latest policy\n70.\nand reform development, and direct the implementation of new policies and reforms; (ii) prepare\nregulations  and  other  administrative  instruments  necessary  to  successfully  implement  policies\nadopted  under  the  Transport  Law;  (iii)  develop  subsector  operation  and  management\nprocedures  and  guidelines;  and  (iv)  introduce  international  standards  and  principles  of  road\nengineering  and  financial  and  economic  analysis.  The  TA  will  provide  hands-on  training\nprograms  to  the  staff  of  MOT\u2019s  road  subsector  management  departments  to  strengthen  their\ncapacity  to  implement  these  initiatives.  Seminars,  workshops,  and  briefing  sessions  will  be\norganized  to  disseminate  the  TA\u2019s  policy  initiatives  to  managerial  and  technical  personnel\nconcerned with road subsector management. International training programs will be organized\nto expose senior government officials and management staff of MOT to up-to-date international\nstandards  for  economic  and  financial  analysis  and  advanced  public  administration  systems,\nincluding  practices  of  good  governance,  resource  mobilization,  and  constructive  legal\nframeworks for private sector participation.\n\nThe TA will require 15 person-months of international consulting services and 10 person-\n71.\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  public  administration,  legislative\ndrafting,  corporate  governance  and  management,  infrastructure  project  financing,  financial\naccounting,  and  human  resource  development.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at\n$600,000 equivalent including a foreign exchange cost of $457,000 and local currency cost of\n$143,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  $500,000  equivalent  to\ncover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  local  currency  cost  of  $43,000  equivalent.  The\nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost of $100,000 equivalent. The TA\nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan. The terms of reference for the TA and the cost estimates are provided in\nAppendix 14.\n\nAs  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  MOT  will  be  responsible  for  its  day-to-day\n72.\nimplementation,  including  liaison  and  coordination  with  other  Government  entities.  The  TA  will\nbe  implemented  over  six  months  starting  from  July  2001.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n73.\nThe economic analysis of the Project is based on a comparison of the with- and without-\nproject  scenarios.  The  principal  sources  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project  are  savings  in\nvehicle  operating  costs,  passenger  time  savings,  and  benefits  arising  from  generated  traffic.\nVehicle operating costs are calculated separately for each vehicle type comprising traffic on the\nroad  sections;  savings,  which  are  attributable  to  the  improved  road  surface,  account  for  more\n\n\f21\n\nthan  85  percent  of  total  benefits.  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  access  of  the  rural  poor  to\nmarkets and social services, and improve safety conditions on the road. However, as sufficient\ndata is not available to quantify these benefits, they have not been included in the analysis.\n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, excluding the improvement\n74.\nof  rural  roads,  is  15.9  percent  (Appendix  15).  The  EIRRs  for  the  various  sections  of  the\nDushanbe-Khulyab road to be rehabilitated range from 14.2 percent to 25.4 percent. Distribution\nanalysis  of  the  net  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  shows  that  vehicle  owners  and  users  of\npassenger and freight transport will be the recipients of such benefits, while the Government will\nhave  a  net  economic  cost.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative\nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project.  The\nanalysis indicates that costs would have to increase by 35 percent and benefits decrease by 26\npercent to bring the EIRR down to the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given the simple nature of the\nrehabilitation  works  and  ADB's  experience  with  similar  projects  in  other  CARs,  such  changes\nare unlikely to occur.\n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n75.\nA  poverty  impact  assessment  (PIA)  comprising  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  poverty\nsituation in the project area and the impact of the Project on poverty was prepared (Appendix\n16).  During  project  processing,  poor  households,  farmers,  producers,  and  government\nauthorities  from  seven  districts15  were  visited  and  interviewed.  Khatlon  Region,  which  has  the\nhighest population density in Tajikistan, suffered heavily from the civil conflict and major natural\ndisasters during the 1990s. The civil conflict resulted in the loss of about 50,000 lives, creating\nmany households headed by women and a large refugee population. The abatement of the civil\nstrife in the region and the country in general has been accompanied by the return of refugees,\nwhich  has  increased  the  incidence  of  poverty.  Khatlon  Region  is  the  second  poorest  of\nTajikistan's four regions in terms of individual per capita expenditures.16 At present, the average\nmonthly  income  per  person  for  a  typical  rural  household  ranges  from  $2.5  to  $4.5  equivalent,\nsubstantially  lower  than  the  national  average  for  rural  households  of  $12  equivalent.\nApproximately 91 percent of households in the region cannot afford the minimum consumption\nbasket and are living in poverty.17\n\n76.\nAgriculture and trade are the most important economic activities in the project area, with\nmanufacturing a distant third. Agriculture's importance in Khatlon Region has been increasing,\naccounting for about 40 percent of GDP and about 65 percent of employment in 1999. Surveys\nindicate  that  the  small  towns  in  the  region  rely  on  agriculture  to  a  greater  extent  than  small\ntowns  in  the  country  in  general.  Agriculture  and  trade  are  dependent  on  transport,  and  road\ntransport  is  by  far  the  most  important  means  of  transport  in  the  project  area.  Transport  costs\nhave a large impact on farmers\u2019 incomes; surveys indicate that transport accounts for almost 20\npercent of the final market prices for their agricultural produce.\n\n77.\nThe Project will reduce poverty in its area of influence by rehabilitating the Dushanbe\u2013\nKhulyab road, which will result in lower transport costs for shipments of agricultural products as\n\n                                                          \n15 The districts are Bokhtar, Dangara, Kazamalik, Kazimalik, Khulyab, Leninsky, and Vose. The interviewed persons\nrepresent a population of about 400,000 in different types of communities, located within 20 km of the Dushanbe-\nKhulyab road and working in agriculture, industry, and other economic activities.\n\n16 Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency. 1999. Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Dushanbe.\n17 Based  on  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  1998  minimum  consumption  basket  of  TJR21,883  per\n\nperson per month.\n\n\f22\n\nwell  as  for  passenger  transport.  Surveys  conducted  for  the  PIA  confirm  the  strong  linkage\nbetween  poverty  and  the  availability  of  reliable  road  transport  services,  indicating  that  60\npercent  of  the  users  of  the  road  are  poor.  The  road  provides  the  primary  link  for  agricultural\nproducers  in  the  project  area  to  larger  markets,  where  they  can  receive  higher  prices  for  their\nproduce. In particular, the road links the rural parts of the project area to Khulyab and Kurgan-\nTyube (the third and fourth largest cities in the country) as well as to Dangara and other market\ncenters. It also links all parts of the project area with Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital and largest\ncity.\n\n78.\nThe Project will reduce poverty by improving rural roads. Surveys conducted for the PIA\nindicate that poor farmers in the project area encounter three main transport-related problems\nthat reduce their incomes: (i) high cost of transport services, (ii) low availability of such services,\nand  (iii)  damage  to  agricultural  produce  caused  by  bad  road  conditions.  Improved  road\nconditions will allow a higher frequency of freight and passenger transport services along these\nroads. The higher frequency of transport services will reduce waiting times and thus encourage\nfarmers  to  take  their  goods  to  markets  offering  higher  prices.  It  will  also  facilitate  access  of\nwholesale  traders  to  rural  areas  to  purchase  produce;  greater  competition  among  traders  will\nresult  in  farmers  receiving  higher  prices  for  their  produce.  Improving  the  physical  condition  of\nthe  rural  roads  will  also  reduce  the  loss  of  agricultural  produce.  In  the  PIA  surveys,  farmers\nstated that 15 percent of their profit on agricultural produce was lost due to damage caused by\nbad road conditions, with poor farmers indicating a loss of 20 percent.\n\n79.\nThe  policy  reforms  to  be  enacted  by  the  Government  as  part  of  the  Project  will  help\nreduce  poverty  by  increasing  the  competitiveness  of  transport  in  the  project  area  and  the\ncountry  as  a  whole.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  complete  the  commercialization  of  all\nGovernment-owned  road  transport  operations,  excluding  large-scale  urban  operations,  and  to\nprivatize  at  least  25  percent  of  these  operations  by  project  completion.  Commercialization  will\ninclude  the  ending  of  mandatory  tariffs  for  passenger  and  freight  operations.  These  steps  will\nensure  that  the  market  for  freight  and  passenger  transport  services  remains  competitive  and\nthat savings in transport costs are passed on to transport users.\n\nThe  Project  will  have  other  poverty  reduction  effects.  The  rehabilitation  works  will\n80.\ngenerate 450 person-years of employment during implementation. About 80 permanent jobs will\nbe created for routine maintenance after project completion. Also, the Project will stimulate the\nlocal  construction  materials  industry  through  purchase  of  these  materials.  During  the\nconstruction  period,  the  poor  located  in  the  project  area  will  benefit  from  the  demand  for\nunskilled  labor  generated  by  the  Project.  Furthermore,  as  the  economic  recovery  in  Tajikistan\ncontinues, the improved access to urban areas will make new employment opportunities more\nreadily accessible to the rural poor. Finally, while access to health and education facilities is not\none of the most important problems confronting the poor in the project area, the rural poor do\nhave  to  travel  to  urban  areas  for  advanced  health  and  education  facilities,  and  the  improved\nroads will improve access to such facilities.\n\n81.\nA  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  was  calculated  for  the  Project.  As  the  rural  roads  to  be\nimproved will be identified after project inception, the PIR was only calculated for the Dushanbe-\nKhulyab road. The PIR, which indicates the proportion of benefits going directly to poor people,\nis estimated to be 62 percent. The PIR will increase significantly when rural roads are included,\nas the benefits from these roads accrue more directly to poor farmers. The PIR will increase as\nthe  level  of  competition  in  transport  increases.  This  illustrates  the  importance  of  enhancing\n\n\f23\n\ncompetition  in  the  transport  market  not  only  to  fuel  economic  growth  but  also  to  help  reduce\npoverty. With higher competition in the transport market, drivers and vehicle owners will pass on\nmost of the transport cost savings to transport users in the form of lower fares and freight rates,\nthus lowering transport costs for the poor.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n82.\nThe Project is subject to the following risks: (i) delay in implementation, (ii) inadequate\ncapacity  for  implementation  such  as  weak  technical  and  managerial  expertise,  (iii)  inadequate\nprovision of counterpart funds, (iv) poor construction quality, (v) inadequate maintenance of the\nrehabilitated  roads,  and  (vi)  unstable  security  situation.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  to\nreduce  these  potential  risks.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  implementation  delays,  the  project\npreparatory TA consultants prepared bidding documents to ensure timely commencement of the\nrehabilitation works. Given the country\u2019s limited absorptive capacity and resources, the Project\ninvolves  the  use  of  relatively  simple  technology  to  avoid  major  technical  or  managerial  risks.\nMOT\u2019s capacity for project implementation will be strengthened though international consulting\nservices for construction supervision and the advisory TA. The use of international competitive\nbidding  procedures  and  packaging  the  civil  works  for  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  into  one\nintegrated contract will minimize logistical difficulties. To minimize the risk of poor quality control\nduring  construction,  the  construction  supervision  consultants  will  assume  overall  responsibility\nfor  material  testing,  monitoring,  and  other  quality  control  measures.  Regarding  the  risk  of\npotential  delays  in  project  implementation  from  a  shortage  of  counterpart  funds,  the  country\u2019s\nabsorptive  capacity  has  been  reflected  in  the  project  scope  and  the  proposed  financing\narrangements,  and  policy  dialogue  has  been  carried  out  with  the  Government  to  ensure\nprovision of adequate funding. The risk of inadequate maintenance of the rehabilitated roads will\nbe addressed by procuring road maintenance equipment under the Project, developing the road\nmaintenance  manual  initiated  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2),  including\nmaintenance in the capacity building and institutional strengthening components of the advisory\nTA, and providing international training in maintenance planning. The continued improvement in\nthe security situation, including successful presidential and parliamentary elections in 1999 and\n2000, will be a crucial factor for sustaining economic recovery. The project area was selected\nconsidering UN security classifications to ensure safety and successful implementation.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n83.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCounterpart Funding.

The Government will ensure that funds allocated\nfor rural road improvement are provided in a timely manner. The Government will\nintroduce measures to encourage active participation of the project beneficiaries\nin  selecting  the  rural  roads  in  accordance  with  ADB's  handbook Mainstreaming\nParticipatory Development Processes. The Government will ensure that the rural\nroads to be rehabilitated are selected taking into consideration the criteria listed\nin Appendix 6.\n\nfor  road  maintenance  accounts \n\nRoad  Maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  (i)  that  the  annual  budget\nallocation  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance,  excluding  new  construction,  of\nroads under MOT\u2019s jurisdiction will be increased by no less than 10 percent per\nannum above the rate of inflation each fiscal year during 2002\u20132004, and (ii) that\nfollowing\nfunding \npercentages of the budget allocation for road maintenance and construction: 50\npercent in 2001, 60 percent in 2002, 65 percent in 2003, and 70 percent in 2004.\nThe Government will ensure sufficient funding for maintenance of the Dushanbe-\nKhulyab  road  and  the  rural  roads  included  in  the  Project.  The  Government  will\nprovide  details  on  actual  road  maintenance  expenditures  to  ADB  project  review\nmissions.\n\nfor  no \n\nthan \n\nless \n\nthe \n\nPostconflict  Infrastructure  Program  Loan.  The  Government  will  comply  with\nthe  transport  sector  action  plan  relating  to  the  preparation  and  adoption  of\nregulations,  decrees,  and  rules  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  implement  the  Transport\nLaw and meet the remaining conditions under the PCIP loan.\n\nTransport  Legal  Reform  Committee.  Within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness,\nthe Government will establish the legal reform committee, headed by the minister\nof  transport  and  including  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the\nInteragency Transport Advisory Committee, the various departments within MOT,\nand  nongovernment  organizations,  to  conduct  a  thorough  review  of  the  legal\nframework  in  the  transport  sector,  and  in  light  of  the  Transport  Law  determine\nwhat additional amendments to other laws, regulations, and rules are required to\nbring  the  legal  framework  in  line  with  the  policies  set  out  in  the  TSPS  and  the\nTransport Law.\n\n(vii)  Commercialization  of  Transport  Services.  The  Government  will  ensure  the\ncommercialization  of  Government-owned  road  transport  operations.  By  project\ncompletion, \nthe  commercialization  of  all\nGovernment-owned  road  transport  operations,  excluding  large-scale  urban\ntransport operations, and privatization of at least 25 percent of these operations.\nCommercialization  will  include  the  phase  out  of  mandatory  tariffs  for  passenger\nand freight operations.\n\nthe  Government  will  complete \n\n(viii)  Road Safety. To ensure a safe road network in the project area, MOT will install\nappropriate  road  safety  facilities  during  implementation  and  after  completion,\nsuch  as  pavement  markings,  warning  signs, \ntraffic  signs  and  signals,\ncommunications facilities, hazard barriers, and traffic monitoring facilities.\n\n(ix) \n\nHuman Resource Development and Training. MOT, with the assistance of the\ninternational  consultants  under  the  advisory  TA,  will  prepare  a  human  resource\n\n\f25\n\n(x) \n\ndevelopment plan based on its future requirements. International training in areas\nrelated  to  project  activities  will  be  conducted  for  selected  staff.  Prior  to\nundertaking  the  international  training,  MOT  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  for\nconcurrence  (i)  training  plans  and  training  programs,  (ii)  a  list  of  candidates  for\ntraining, and (iii) a program of workshops to be held at MOT by those who have\nreceived  international  training.  Upon  completion  of  each  training  program,  MOT\nwill  provide  ADB  with  an  evaluation  report  identifying  subjects  appropriate  for\nincorporation into MOT\u2019s regular staff training courses. MOT will ensure that staff\nwho receive international training continue to work for MOT for two years, under\nnormal circumstances, following completion of training.\n\nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  road  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance  works  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines.    The  Government  will\nensure  the  implementation  of  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures  by\nrequiring that all contracts related to the rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab\nroad and the rural roads contain adequate provisions requiring the contractor to\n(i)  take  appropriate  erosion  control  measures;  (ii)  minimize  any  adverse  impact\ndue  to  altered  embankments,  borrow  pits,  and  other  activities  as  set  out  in  the\nIEE;  and  (iii)  take  appropriate  safety  measures  to  minimize  risks  of  landslides,\nsoil  subsidence,  and  related  occurrences.

Traffic  was  classified  into  seven\nvehicle  types,  including  cars,  pickups,  buses,  and  four  types  of  trucks.  Cars  comprise  the\nmajority of traffic, accounting for 68 percent.\n\n2.\nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2001\u2013\n2024 (Table A5). The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand  population,  and  on  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  freight  and  passenger  vehicles.\nPopulation  is  expected  to  increase  at  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  1.7  percent  per  year\nduring 2001\u20132006, and 2.0 percent during the remainder of the project period. GDP is forecast\nto  grow  at  annual  rates  of  4.5  percent  through  2006,  and  5.0  percent  thereafter.  Income\nelasticities  of  demand  used  for  2001\u20132006  are  1.8  for  passengers  and  2.0  for  freight,  while\nelasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are used for passengers and freight respectively for the remainder of\nthe project period.\n\n3.\nAverage  annual  growth  rates  for  passenger  and  freight  traffic  are  6.6  percent  during\n2001-2006.  After  2006,  passenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  at  a  rate  of  5.8  percent  per  year,\nwhile  freight  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  at  5.3  percent.  Generated  traffic  resulting  from  lower\ntransport costs arising from the Project comprises a small proportion of total traffic. Traffic levels\non the project sections are forecast to range from 1,400\u20132,900 in 2001 to 5,400\u201310,800 in 2024.\n\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n\n\f 38\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nTable A5: Traffic Forecast for the Project\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\n\nCar\n\nPickup\n\nBus\n\nLight Medium\nTruck\n\nTruck\n\nHeavy\nTruck\n\nArticulated\nTruck\n\nTotal\n\n1,587\n2,185\n2,896\n3,839\n6,027\n\n1,817\n2,501\n3,316\n4,395\n6,901\n\n965\n1,328\n1,761\n2,334\n3,665\n\n1,060\n1,459\n1,934\n2,564\n4,026\n\n1,104\n1,520\n2,015\n2,671\n4,193\n\n47\n65\n84\n108\n164\n\n48\n66\n86\n111\n167\n\n35\n48\n62\n81\n122\n\n9\n12\n16\n21\n31\n\n4\n6\n7\n9\n14\n\n225\n310\n411\n544\n854\n\n415\n571\n757\n1,004\n1,576\n\n103\n142\n188\n249\n391\n\n82\n113\n150\n198\n311\n\n81\n111\n148\n196\n308\n\n209\n288\n381\n506\n794\n\n250\n344\n456\n605\n949\n\n103\n142\n188\n249\n391\n\n127\n175\n232\n307\n482\n\n90\n124\n164\n218\n342\n\n123\n169\n219\n284\n429\n\n135\n186\n241\n311\n471\n\n87\n120\n155\n201\n303\n\n71\n98\n127\n164\n248\n\n63\n87\n112\n145\n220\n\n143\n197\n255\n330\n499\n\n171\n235\n305\n395\n596\n\n118\n162\n210\n272\n412\n\n74\n102\n132\n171\n258\n\n79\n109\n141\n182\n276\n\n36\n50\n64\n83\n126\n\n43\n59\n77\n99\n150\n\n29\n40\n52\n67\n101\n\n18\n25\n32\n42\n63\n\n20\n28\n36\n46\n70\n\n2,370\n3,262\n4,310\n5,694\n8,892\n\n2,879\n3,963\n5,237\n6,920\n10,811\n\n1,440\n1,982\n2,616\n3,453\n5,385\n\n1,441\n1,984\n2,622\n3,467\n5,419\n\n1,441\n1,984\n2,622\n3,467\n5,421\n\nRoad Section and Year\nDushanbe--Khazil-Kala\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2024\n\nKhazil-Kala--Kurgan-Tyube\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2024\n\nKurgan-Tyube--Dangara\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2024\n\nDangara--Gulistan\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2024\n\nGulistan--Khulyab\n2001\n2006\n2011\n2016\n2024\n\n\f39\n\n      Appendix 6\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA FOR RURAL ROADS\n\nItem\n\nCriteria\n\nGeographic Location\n\n\u2022  Within 50 km of the national road\n\nPoverty and Social Considerations\n\n\u2022  Roads providing access to markets for\n\nproducts of the poor\n\n\u2022  Roads providing access to social\nservices for poor communities\n\u2022  More densely populated rural areas,\n\nespecially those having a large number\nof farmers with less than 3 hectares of\nland per capita\n\n\u2022  Minimum economic internal rate of\n\nreturn of 12 percent\n\n\u2022  Maximum cost per km of $10,000\n\u2022  Roads  with  vehicles  carrying  poor\npassengers  and  freight  produced  by\nthe poor.\n\n\u2022  Ability  and  commitment  of \n\nlocal\ngovernments  to  maintain  the  roads,  in\nlabor-intensive\nparticular \nmaintenance schemes.\n\nusing \n\n\u2022  Link to Asian Development Bank rural\ncredit/agricultural rehabilitation project\nand/or other projects in the same area.\n\nEconomic/Traffic Criteria\n\nSustainability \n\nCooperation\n\n\fItem\n\nA.

Direct observations improved understandings of the general\nproject  setting  and  physical  conditions  of  the  surrounding  environment.  Some  sections  of  the\ndescription  of  the  environment,  as  well  as  background  information,  have  been  taken  from  the\nEnvironmental Profile of Tajikistan.2 The summary IEE draws information from the phase I draft\nfinal report submitted in December 1999 by the consultants (footnote 1), and was completed for\nthe  rehabilitation  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road.    The  improvement  of  the  rural  roads  will\ncomprise minor works to existing roads and will not have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n2.\nLocated  in  the  heart  of  the  Pamir  Mountains,  Tajikistan  covers  a  territory  of  143,000\nsquare  kilometers  (km).  Rugged,  extreme  relief  characterizes  the  geography,  with  altitudes\nranging  from  300  meters  (m)  to  7495  m  above  sea  level.  Main  vegetative  zones  are  desert,\nsteppe, mountain, and meadow. The population of Tajikistan in 1998 was 6.1 million, which was\nlarge considering that only 7 percent of the total territory is arable. Most of the population and\neconomic activities are concentrated in a few broad valleys. The most densely populated region\nis  Khatlon  Region  in  the  southwest  of  the  country,  followed  by  Leninabad  Region  in  the\nnorthwest,  with  85.5  persons  and  71.9  persons  per  square  kilometer,  respectively.  A  densely\npopulated  corridor  extends  from  Tursunzade  on  the  western  border,  eastward  through\nDushanbe,  and  further  to  the  northeast.    Eighty  percent  of  agricultural  lands  are  pasture.\nBetween  pasture,  reserve,  and  forested  land  uses,  vast  territories  in  Tajikistan  are  virtually\nuninhabited,  reflecting  the  harsh  physical  environment.  According  to  1998  data,  14  percent  of\nagricultural lands are cultivated, with two thirds of these intensively irrigated. The aesthetic and\nlandscape qualities are significant within the road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project.\nNo known archaeological sites exist along the road corridor.\n\n3.\nWater resources are abundant and Tajikistan\u2019s hydropower production is ranked among\nthe  highest  in  the  world.  Tajikistan  occupies  only  6  percent  of  the  land  area  of  the  Aral  Sea\nbasin  but  supplies  roughly  50  percent  of  the  water  flowing  into  the  basin.  However,  water\nresources in the region are poorly managed, creating transboundary and internal quantity and\nquality problems.\n\nThe  major  manifestations  of  environmental  degradation  in  Tajikistan  are  (i)  natural\n4.\ndisasters,  (ii)  land  degradation,  (iii)  limited  clean  drinking  water,  (iv)  low  levels  of  water\ntreatment,  and  (v)  deterioration  of  wildlife  and  protected  areas.  In  the  past  five  years,  water-\nrelated natural disasters, such as landslides, mudslides, and floods, have killed more than 200\npeople and caused damage estimated at several million dollars. Steep slopes and unstable soils\ncontribute to the 50,000 annual landslides. Soil erosion is also a significant issue in Tajikistan,\nprimarily  as  a  by-product  of  intensive  irrigation,  flooding,  wind,  overgrazing,  and  loss  of  plant\n\n                                                          \n1 TA 3168-TAJ : Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n2  Asian Development Bank. 2000. Environmental Profile of Tajikistan (Draft Final Report), Manila.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nand tree covers. Salinization of soil is also a major environmental concern, due to poor drainage\nof irrigated lands.\n\nC.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Location\n\n5.\nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  environmental  impact  on  archaeologically\nsignificant  sites,  nature  protection  areas,  or  other  culturally  important  sites.  Rehabilitation\nactivities will be confined to the existing right\u2013of\u2013way (ROW) of the road. No significant changes\nof  the  hydrological  characteristics  of  the  rehabilitation  sites  are  likely.  The  altered  road\nembankment,  borrow  pits  and  provisions  for  quarry  operations,  disposal  sites,  and  minor\nchanges in delineation to improve traffic safety will not require permanent land acquisition.\n\n6.\nSome land areas, in the vicinity of the rehabilitation sites, will be temporarily occupied by\nconstruction  worker  camps.  Loss  of  property  may  arise,  such  as  unauthorized  tree  felling  for\nfuelwood,  poaching  of  edible  animals  and  birds  of  the  locality  in  spite  of  prohibitions,  and\ncreation  of  hazardous  traffic  flow  due  to  lack  of  concern  about  local  needs.  To  mitigate  these\nimpacts, the contracts will contain specific provisions to avoid significant adverse impact due to\naltered embankments, borrow pits, and other activities. Borrowing of materials, as well as other\noperations  outside  the  ROW,  will  be  planned  and  carried  out  in  accordance  with  agreements\nwhich will be made with the owners of the affected lands in advance and will include appropriate\ncompensation.\n\nIn  some  of  the  road  sections,  landslides,  rockslides,  mudslides,  flooding,  or  soil\n7.\nsubsidence are a risk due to the location of the site. Those cases will be carefully recorded and\nappropriate mitigation measures included in the final detailed design of the rehabilitation works.\nErosion  control  of  the  embankments,  pavements,  and  other  road  structures  will  be  taken  into\naccount everywhere in the project area, in accordance with the quality standards for the design\nand construction of the rehabilitation works.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design\n\n8.\nAppropriate  environmental  clearance  will  be  obtained  from  the  local  environmental\nofficials.  The  affected  people  will  be  invited  to  meetings  at  each  site  on  the  design  of  the\nrehabilitation  works,  to  allow  a  participatory  approach.  Their  views  will  be  recorded  and  taken\ninto  account  as  much  as  possible.  Principles  for  compensation  of  losses,  as  well  as\nopportunities created by the rehabilitation works, will be presented. Local commercial activities\nwill  likely  be  affected  at  some  sites.  On  the  other  hand,  new  business  opportunities,  such  as\nproviding services to workers, will become available.\n\n9.\nNo  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  design  are  foreseen,  as\nlong as the asphalt plants, camps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, and\nnational planning standards are appropriately followed. Special attention needs to be paid to the\ndesign  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  workers  camps  and  to  monitoring  their  water  supply,\nwastewater treatment, and sanitary conditions.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction\n\n10.\nSurface  erosion  and  silt  runoff  may  occur  on  the  bare  embankment  and  unprotected\nslopes during heavy rainfall. In flat terrain, the lost silt is expected to settle in the side ditches,\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nwhich  are  designed  for  surface  water  runoff  where  applicable.  In  erosion\u2013prone  areas,  the\ntiming  of  works  is  important.  The  embankment  slopes  will  be  planted  with  grass  or  otherwise\nprotected after the works have been completed. There are opportunities to upgrade the current\nlevel of erosion control (for instance, rehabilitation of roadside tree plantations).\n\n11.\nContracts  will  require  that  asphalt  and  hot-mix  plants  be  located  at  least  500  meters\naway from the nearest sensitive receptor, e.g., schools and hospitals. Asphalt will be purchased\nfrom  permanent  factories.  Operators  will  be  required  to  install  emission  controls  where\napplicable.  Trucks  carrying  earth,  sand,  or  stone  will  be  covered  with  tarps  to  avoid  spilling.\nCare  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic  disruptions  to  road\ntransport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed in the context of\ndetailed design and implementation planning of the rehabilitation works.\n\n12.\nTo  ensure  contractors\u2019  compliance  with  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards,\nregular  inspections  by  the  MOT  environmental  staff  and  local  government  units  will  be\nundertaken.  Their  findings  will  be  attached  to  the  weekly  and  monthly  progress  reports,  with\ncomments on the possible response to emerging environmental concerns. The inspections will\ncover  all  relevant  issues,  for  instance  the  use  of  appropriate  materials,  and  include  possible\nclaims made by the affected people.\n\n4.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n\n13.\nThe  planned  road  rehabilitation  activities  will  increase  traffic  levels.  The  effect  on  air\nquality  and  noise  levels  is  considered  minor,  and  no  particular  mitigation  measures  are\nrecommended.  Road  safety  is  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Possible\nsecondary  benefits  include  reduction  of  car  accidents  and  reduced  spills  of  hazardous\nchemicals transported by trucks.\n\nD.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n14.\nEnvironmental  monitoring  of  the  Project  will  be  conducted  by  MOT,  the  Executing\nAgency.    MOT  will  ensure  that  tender  documents  and  contracts  for  the  Project  incorporate\nthrough  weekly\nenvironmental mitigation measures. MOT  will  supervise \ninspection  visits  to  the  sites  (visual  observations  and  communications)  and  preparation  of\nmonthly  reports.

A separate poverty impact assessment was\nprepared, and the summary poverty impact assessment is included in Appendix 16.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project Area\n\n2.\nTajikistan  is  among  the  20  poorest  countries  in  the  world.  Eighty\u2013three  percent  of  the\npopulation  lives  below  the  poverty  line,  an  increase  from  about  33  percent  at  the  time  of\nindependence in 1991. The major ethnic groups in Tajikistan are Tajiks (65 percent), Uzbeks (25\npercent),  and  Russians,  including  Russian-speaking  nationalities  (3.5  percent).  The  remaining\npopulation  comprises  Tatars,  Kyrgyz,  and  Ukrainians.  The  major  languages  spoken  are  Tajik,\nRussian,  Pamiri  dialects,  and  Sogdian.  Although  Tajikistan  is  a  secular  state,  80  percent  of  the\npopulation are Moslem (mostly Sunni), and the rest belong to Ismailsm (a sect of Shia Islam) and\nthe Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n3.\nThe majority of Tajikistan\u2019s population resides in the western part of the country. According\nto  the  official  census,  220,000  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  6.1  million  people  live  in  the  eastern  Gorno-\nBadakhshan Autonomous Region, a territory that makes up almost half of the area of the country.\nApproximately 1.5 million people live in Tajikistan\u2019s urban centers. The majority of the population of\nTajikistan (72 percent) lives in a total of 3,200 small rural settlements, ranging from 100 to 1,000\npeople.\n\n4.\nThe project area covers 5,080 square kilometers (km) from Dushanbe to Khulyab through\nKurgan-Tyube  and  Dangara,  all  located  in  the  Khatlon  Region  in  southwestern  Tajikistan.  The\nProject  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  about  80  km  of  the  most  seriously  damaged  road  sections,\nrehabilitation of about 150 km of rural roads, and assisting the Government in developing a road\nmaintenance  system  in  the  project  area.  The  road  traverses  the  following  districts:  Bokhtar,\nDangara,  Kazamalik,  Kazimalik,  Khulyab,  Leninsky,  and  Vose  with  a  population  of  71,348  in\nKazimalik, 70,000 in Bokhtar, 100,000 in Dangara, and 147,000 in Khulyab.\n\n5.\nThe population of Khatlon Region is 2.1 million. The annual population growth rate is high in\nKhatlon Region, about 3.5 percent in 1999, compared with the national annual growth rate at 2.0\npercent.  2    Khatlon  Region  is  a  war-affected  area  and  a  destination  of  returnees.  The  area  was\npopulated  through  forced  relocation  during  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  regime,  leaving  a\npatchwork  of  mono-ethnic  villages.  However,  most  of  the  villages  are  now  populated  with  mixed\nethnic groups.\n\n6.\nAgriculture is the dominant economic activity in Khatlon Region, and the major agricultural\nproducts  are  cotton,  wheat,  and  barley.  The  production  of  wheat  increased  from  108,028  tons  in\n1992  to  130,817  tons  in  1998,  whereas  the  production  of  cotton  decreased  from  16,600  tons  in\n\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n2 United Nations Development Programme. 1999. Tajikistan Human Development Report. Dushanbe.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\n1992 to 14,200 tons in 1998. In 1999, the production of cereals also decreased, putting the country\nin a food deficit situation.\n\nAlthough the Government has been pursuing privatization of the state and collective farms,\n7.\nprogress has been slow in Khatlon Region. There were 1,392 private farms in Khatlon Region in\n1998 out of a total of 10,207 private farms in the country. In 1998, there were 345 state farms in\nthe  country  and  184  in  Khatlon  Region.  Of  collective  farms  in  1998,  138  were  in  Khatlon  Region\nand 358 in the country.\n\n8. \nThe preliminary social assessment identified the following major problems of the districts in\nthe  project  area:  lack  of  agricultural  inputs  and  fertilizer,  inadequate  irrigation,  and  lack  of\ntransportation services. These problems have resulted in very low agricultural yields, and in some\nplaces only half of the arable land is under cultivation.\n\n9.\nDuring site visits by missions, farmers stated that one of their serious concerns was the lack\nof road transport services to the central markets for sale of their products. Transport services are\nvery  limited  due  to  serious  damage  to  the  roads,  shortages  of  fuel  (mainly  gasoline),  and  high\nprices  of  road  transport  services  due  to  inadequate  supply  (TJR1,200  for  a  trip  by  bus  to\nDushanbe). The deputy chairman of Kazimalik emphasized that the prices of agricultural products\nare much higher in Dushanbe (about 15 to 20 percent) than those in local markets. The improved\nroad  transport  services  will  reduce  the  transportation  costs  for  farmers,  and  provide  them  with\nopportunities to increase income.\n\nC. \n\nLiving Conditions\n\n10.\nThe average household size in Tajikistan is 7.1 persons. The household size of urban and\nrural families is 5.7 and 7.6 persons, respectively. In Khatlon Region, the average household size\nis slightly higher, about 7.7 in urban areas and 7.8 in rural areas.\n\n11.\nHousehold  income  has  severely  decreased  in  the  last  decade.  Drawing  of  wages  and\nsalaries,  once  the  primary  source  of  income,  has  ceased  for  most  families.  In  1991,  salaries\nrepresented 70 percent of total average income, but in 1996 they represented only 37 percent. The\nsources of household income in Khatlon Region in 1999 are summarized in Table A13.\n\nTable A13: Source of Household Income in Khatlon Region (1999)\n(Percent)\n\nItem\nSource of Income\nSalary\nIncome from personal plot, including commercial activity\nHumanitarian aid\nSocial allowances (pension and benefits)\nOther income including cash received as gift\n\nTotal\n\nSource: Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency.\n\nTotal\n\nUrban\n\nRural\n\n 15.2\n62.9\n  3.7\n  0.8\n 17.4\n100.0\n\n 43.0\n 30.4\n  5.3\n  1.4\n19.9\n100.0\n\n 10.3\n 68.7\n  3.4\n  0.7\n16.9\n100.0\n\nThe majority of the population (72 percent) lives in rural areas where salaries are very low.\n12.\nSalaries in rural areas (equivalent to $2.50-$4.50 a month) are estimated from 33 to 57 percent of\nthe average national salary. In the project area, the annual salary of the low-income group of the\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\npopulation was estimated from about TJR30,000 to TJR40,000. With the low wage levels and with\naverage  family  size  at  more  than  six  persons,  86  percent  of  the  household  budget  goes  for  food\npurchases.  This  ratio  is  82  percent  in  urban  areas  and  91  percent  in  rural  areas.    As  a  result  of\nprice increases due to removal of subsidies and price controls, more and more people live in a self-\nsufficient  manner  by  producing  their  own  food.  Migration  to  urban  areas  has  become  the  only\noption for many, and the migration trend is expected to rise over time.\n\nThe  decline  of  state-owned  enterprises,  including  state  and  collective  farms,  has  led  to\n13.\nwidespread  unemployment.  Even  though  the  official  unemployment  rate  was  only  3.2  percent  in\n1999, the actual rate was estimated from 30 to 35 percent. State employees have also suffered in\nsocial  terms  since  independence,  not  only  because  of  their  low  average  salaries,  but  because\nwages are frequently in arrears. In the social sectors, the monthly salaries for teachers and health\ncare and social workers are far from sufficient to meet their minimum consumption requirements.\n\n14.\nThe Government\u2019s existing social protection system is not adequate to meet basic needs.\nIn the past, the state provided uniform social security for the population with little differentiation or\ntargeting. In a country where 83 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and where\nfiscal constraints prevent the use of public funds to provide the level of social support experienced\nunder the FSU, the need to rationalize the social security system is critical.\n\n15. Women and girls in particular are exposed to poor living conditions. The combined effects\nof  transition,  the  civil  conflict,  the  collapse  of  the  state  social  safety  net,  and  an  increase  in\nculturally  based  gender  discrimination,  have  especially  affected  women  and  girls.  The  economic\ntransition  has  resulted  in  closure  of  industries  such  as  textile  manufacturing  and  agricultural\nprocessing  that  employed  a  primarily  female  labor  force.  The  number  of  households  headed  by\nwomen has increased as a direct consequence of the civil conflict, in which approximately 26,000\nfamilies  lost  their  primary  breadwinner.  Although  an  exact  figure  on  the  number  of  households\nheaded  by  women  in  the  project  area  is  not  available,  key  informants  stated  that  the  number  in\nKhatlon  Region  is  high,  which  seems  reasonable  due  to  the  central  location  of  Khatlon  Region\nduring the civil conflict.\n\nThe  population  within  the  project  area  has  access  to  schools  and  health  facilities,  but  the\n16.\nquality of these facilities is very poor. The education sector has particularly suffered from the civil\nconflict  as  schools  were  used  as  military  bases,  and  equipment  and  materials  were  stolen.\nTeachers left their positions due to low salaries.  Provision of free school meals has been stopped\nresulting in increasing nutrition deficiency among children.\n\n17.\nAccess to safe drinking water has declined from 60 percent in 1997 to 48 percent in 1998.\nIn rural areas, only 15 percent of the population had access in 1997. Under these circumstances, a\nnumber  of  serious  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  and  tuberculosis,  which  are  known  to  be  closely\nlinked with poor living conditions, have sharply increased.\n\nD.  \n\nMajor Problems of Communities\n\n18.\nOne  of  the  main  problems  for  the  communities  in  the  project  area  is  a  severe  lack  of\nemployment opportunities. In the project area, the unemployment rate was estimated at about 25\npercent. The quality of health and education facilities in the project area is very poor, resulting in\nsevere health problems.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\n19.\nLow agriculture production is another concern. One of the causes has been the lack of all\u2013\nweather  road  transport  facilities  and  good  road  transport  services  necessary  for  the  transport  of\nagricultural  inputs  and  outputs.  The  majority  of  farmers  in  the  project  area  depend  on  transport\nservices  to  sell  their  products  in  the  central  markets.  Due  to  irregular  and  expensive  transport,\nhowever,  most  of  the  farmers  sell  their  products  locally,  which  results  in  lower  income  through\nsales at much lower prices than if the products were sold at the central markets.\n\nE.  \n\nExpected Beneficiaries\n\n20.\nAll  groups  of  affected  individuals  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  Project.  The  Project  is\nexpected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  socioeconomic  development  in  the  region,  to  provide\nimmediate  economic  benefits  for  farmers  through  better  access  to  markets  and  to  agricultural\ninputs, and to generate employment in local economies. The improvement of 150 km of rural roads\nin the project area will improve access to markets and social facilities for farmers living off the main\nroad.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  ensure  that  necessary  maintenance  of  the  rural  roads  is\ncarried out.  In addition, industries will benefit from an improved road network to city centers in the\nproject  area,  for  transportation  of  export  goods  and  improved  distribution  of  products  to  major\ncities, including Dushanbe.\n\nF.  \n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n21.\nNo  major  adverse  impact  from  the  Project  is  expected.  All  road  sections  included  in  the\nProject  involve  existing  roads,  and  their  rehabilitation  will  not  result  in  the  development  of  new\nconduits  for  disease  transmission  or  increase  the  potential  for  disease  transmission.  The  Project\nwill not require any permanent acquisition of land.\n\n22.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  social  groups  in  the  project  area.  Skilled  and\nunskilled  labor  will  be  engaged  for  the  rehabilitation  works  and  for  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance works after project completion. This will generate temporary and permanent income\nsources  for  the  people  living  near  the  road,  and  help  lower  unemployment  in  the  local  economy.\nThere are no issues related to indigenous people.\n\nG. \n\nGender Issues\n\n23.\nNo  gender  issues  are  expected  to  arise  during  project  implementation.  Given  the  difficult\nphysical conditions of rehabilitation works, women may not benefit from direct participation in the\nworks,  but  rather  through  indirect  participation.  One  opportunity  is  that  they  may  work  in  the\nworkers\u2019  service  station  during  the  construction  period.  No  adverse  impacts  on  women  are\nenvisaged at this stage. The Project will build and use a gender disaggregated monitoring system,\nto assess the impact of the Project on women in particular.\n\nH.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased  on  the  social  impact  assessment  carried  out  during  ADB\u2019s  project  processing\n24.\nmissions,  the  Project  will  not  have  any  major  adverse  social  impacts  and  will  not  require  any\nresettlement.  The  minor  adverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated  in  accordance  with  the  measures\nrecommended  in  this  SIA  to  a  satisfactory  level.  The  Project  will  be  able  to  contribute  to  local\nsocioeconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  providing  temporary  and  permanent\nemployment  opportunities  for  the  unskilled  and  skilled  laborers  living  near  the  project  road;  (ii)\ngenerating additional business opportunities for local people through purchase of local construction\n\n\fmaterials  and  daily  consumables;  and  (iii)  reducing  transport  costs  and  enhancing  access  of  the\nrural population to markets, other economic opportunities, and social services.\n\n57\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nINSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY SUPPORT IN ROAD SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nObjectives\n\n1.\nThe main objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to implement the market-oriented\npolicy reforms initiated under the Asian Development Bank\u2013financed Postconflict Infrastructure\nProgram,1  and  the  recommendations  for  sector  policy  reforms  and  institutional  restructuring\nmade  by  the  ADB\u2013financed  TA  3114.2  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  build  up  basic\ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  to  enable  economic  recovery  and\ndevelop  the  road  subsector.

Economic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. The\nProject involves rehabilitation of approximately 80 kilometers of the Dushanbe-Khulyab road. In\nthe without\u2013project scenario, the road would receive only minimal maintenance and continue to\ndeteriorate.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to\ninternational standards as part of the program prepared under the project preparatory technical\nassistance  (TA).1  The  economic  analysis  covers  a  period  of  24  years  (2001-2024),  including\nabout 4 years for project implementation. All benefits and costs were estimated in constant 2000\nprices.\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\nProject  economic  costs \n\nimprovement  and\n2.\nmaintenance,  as  well  as  rural  road  improvement,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Costs\nwere  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable  groups.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was\nthen  applied  to  the  nontradable  portion.  The  opportunity  cost  of  unskilled  labor  was  valued  at\n0.75.\n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\ninclude \n\nThe  principal  sources  of  economic  benefits  for  the  Project  are  savings  in  vehicle\n3.\noperating  costs  (VOCs),  passenger  time  savings,  and  benefits  arising  from  generated  traffic.\nEconomic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the  same  method  used  for  costs.  The  Project  will\nimprove  the  access  of  the  rural  poor  to  markets  and  social  services,  and  improve  safety\nconditions on the road. However, sufficient data is not available to quantify these benefits, and\nthey were not included in the analysis.\n\n4.\nSavings in VOCs comprise the largest category of benefits, accounting for more than 85\npercent  of  total  benefits,  and  arise  from  the  improved  road  conditions  resulting  from  the  civil\nworks  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The  VOCs  are  calculated  for  each  vehicle  type.  Unit\neconomic  VOCs  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  were  estimated  using  the  highway  design\nand maintenance model (HDM-Manager). VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements\nin  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average  speed  in  some\nsections.  Estimates  of  VOC  savings  by  vehicle  type  are  shown  in  Table  A15.1.  Benefits  from\nVOC savings for generated traffic are estimated at half the value for normal traffic.\n\n                                                \n1 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nTable A15.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n($ per \u2018000 vehicle-km)\n\nBuses\n1079.5\n1024.0\n55.5\n\nLight\nTrucks\n276.1\n242.7\n33.4\n\nMedium\nTrucks\n615.9\n547.7\n68.2\n\nHeavy\nTrucks\n1319.0\n1179.7\n139.3\n\nArticulated\nTrucks\n897.7\n793.6\n104.1\n\nScenario\nWithout Project  a\nWith Project  b\nVOC Savings\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\na  For an international roughness indicator of 8.7.\nb  For an international roughness indicator of 4.4.\n\nPickups\n135.6\n112.0\n23.6\n\nCars\n143.0\n123.8\n19.2\n\nD.\n\nResults of Economic Analysis\n\n5.\nEconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for the national road sections\nand for the overall Project.

The sensitivity analysis, shown in Table A15.3, indicates that\ncosts would have to increase by 35 percent and benefits decrease by 26 percent for the EIRR to\nreach the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given the uncomplicated nature of the rehabilitation works\nand ADB's experience with similar projects in other Central Asian republics, such changes are\nunlikely to occur.\n\n\f  64\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nTable A15.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n($ million)\n\nYear\n\nCapital\n\nMaintenance Total Costs\n\nVOC Savings\n\nCosts\n\nBenefits\nTime \nSavings\n\nGenerated \nTraffic\n\nTotal \nBenefits\n\nNet Benefits\n\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n3.468\n6.643\n5.897\n5.897\n3.468\n0.000\n1.835\n1.342\n1.457\n1.719\n0.459\n0.000\n0.846\n0.352\n0.000\n0.000\n2.474\n0.549\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n1.642\n0.000\n1.304\n\n3.468\n6.643\n5.897\n5.902\n3.571\n0.113\n1.872\n1.461\n1.675\n1.814\n0.569\n0.142\n1.156\n0.914\n1.048\n0.293\n2.695\n0.679\n0.468\n0.327\n0.345\n1.983\n0.228\n1.699\n\n0.005\n0.103\n0.113\n0.037\n0.119\n0.218\n0.096\n0.111\n0.142\n0.310\n0.562\n1.048\n0.293\n0.221\n0.130\n0.468\n0.327\n0.345\n0.341\n0.228\n0.395\n\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n2.849\n3.192\n3.477\n3.930\n4.605\n5.197\n5.915\n6.514\n7.028\n7.839\n8.413\n8.990\n9.511\n10.495\n11.164\n11.721\n12.405\n13.049\n14.248\n14.764\n\n0.182\n0.205\n0.225\n0.253\n0.299\n0.340\n0.388\n0.436\n0.484\n0.547\n0.589\n0.633\n0.676\n0.723\n0.772\n0.819\n0.865\n0.915\n0.979\n1.023\n\n0.281\n0.312\n0.339\n0.377\n0.432\n0.481\n0.540\n0.590\n0.633\n0.699\n0.744\n0.793\n0.837\n0.903\n0.953\n0.998\n1.049\n1.097\n1.213\n1.260\n\n3.064\n3.430\n3.738\n4.217\n4.935\n5.565\n6.329\n6.974\n7.533\n8.402\n9.014\n9.633\n10.195\n11.210\n11.921\n12.520\n13.244\n13.929\n15.204\n15.766\n\n(3.468)\n(6.643)\n(5.897)\n(5.902)\n(0.507)\n3.317\n1.866\n2.756\n3.260\n3.751\n5.759\n6.832\n6.377\n7.488\n7.966\n9.340\n7.500\n10.531\n11.453\n12.193\n12.898\n11.946\n14.976\n14.067\n\neconomic internal rate of return =\n\n15.9%\n\nnet present value =\n\n8.0\n\nTable A15.3: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nScenario\n1.

The analysis was\ncarried out in June and July 2000.\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\n2.\n\nThe PIA\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nassessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will be passed on to\npassengers and owners of freight;\n\nassessed the distribution of the net benefits between these and other groups;\n\nidentified the proportion of poor and very poor beneficiaries and the net benefits\nthey will receive;\n\nclarified the assumptions and analysis behind the distribution analysis and\npoverty impact assessment; and\n\n(v) \n\nidentified complementary activities to help reduce poverty in the project area.\n\n3.\nThe main findings of the study are that the Project will bring direct benefits to the poor\nand very poor people in the project area. This will be achieved by conveying a substantial share\nof the net benefits from the main project road to the poor and very poor by decreasing vehicle\noperating costs and creating employment opportunities. Maximum impact will be achieved if the\ntransport  sector  is  rendered  more  competitive  by  implementing  the  recommended  policy\nmeasures.\n\nB. \n\nProject Area\n\n1.\n\nDescription of the Project Area and Project Impact Area\n\nThe  project  is  located  in  Khatlon  Region  in  southwestern  Tajikistan.  Since  the  main\n4.\nproject  road  is  part  of  the  national  road  network,  which  provides  international  as  well  as\ninterregional communications, the Project\u2019s impact area is considered to be the Khatlon Region.\nThe road serves the majority of the region\u2019s population and economic activities, and most of the\nimpacts of the road rehabilitation project will occur in this region. However, the majority of the\nimpacts of the road rehabilitation project will occur in the project area geographically identified to\ninclude a corridor of land on either side of the alignment. This road corridor falls almost entirely\nwithin Khatlon Region, and covers an area of 5,080 square km south of Dushanbe, the capital\nand largest city. The PIA has restricted its data collection and analysis to the project area itself,\nwhile the whole region is considered when assessing broader impact issues.\n\n5.\nKhatlon is the most populous of Tajikistan\u2019s four regions, with an estimated 35 percent of\nthe country\u2019s total population of 6.1 million. Although Khatlon Region contains Tajikistan\u2019s third\nand  fourth  largest  cities  (Khulyab  and  Kurgan\u2013Tyube),  the  economy  of  the  area  is  primarily\nagricultural.  Cotton, grains (primarily wheat and barley), fruits, and vegetables are the primary\ncrops. Aside from cotton, much of the agricultural production is transported to markets where it\n\n                                                \n1 TA  3168 \u2013TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\nis sold directly to consumers. Khatlon\u2019s small rural towns rely more on agriculture than do towns\nin the rest of the nation.  Trade is ranked as the second most important economic activity in the\nregion. Manufacturing is in a distant third place. Agriculture is the largest source of employment,\nand its share of total employment has steadily increased, reaching 65 percent in 1998. Roads\nare  the  most  important  means  of  domestic  transport  in  Tajikistan,  supporting  agricultural\nproduction and providing vital access for the rural population to the main administrative centers\nand markets. Khatlon Region is described as worse off than other regions, due in part to the fact\nthat the heaviest fighting during the civil war was in Khatlon. For example, damage due to civil\nunrest is more  prevalent  in  Khatlon  Region  and  slightly  more  prevalent  among  the  poorest  20\npercent of households.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty in the Project Area\n\n6.\nThe most comprehensive source of data on poverty in Tajikistan is the Tajikistan Living\nStandards Survey2 (TLSS) conducted by the State Statistical Agency with TA from World Bank\nand  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  The  TLSS  collected  data  on\ndemographics,  housing,  expenditure,  consumption,  and  other  indicators.  Levels  of  poverty  in\nTajikistan  are  high  with  approximately  83  percent  of  the  population  not  able  to  afford  the\nminimum  consumption  basket.3  This  means  that  approximately  5  million  Tajik  people  are\nconcerned  about  how  they  will  provide  for  their  basic  necessities.    Ninety-one  percent  of  the\npopulation of Khatlon Region (approximately 2 million) are living below the poverty line. Table\nA16.1 shows the geographic profile of poverty in the country.\n\nTable A16.1: Poverty Levels in Tajikistan by Region\n\nItem\n\nTotal Population\n(000)\nDushanbe\n562\nGBAR\n206\nRRS\n1,338\nLeninbad\n1,870\nKhatlon\n2,151\n6,127\n     Total\nNote :  GBAR = Gorno-Badakshan Autonomous Region, RRS = Region of Republican Subordination.\nSource:  World Bank. 2000.

Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Dushanbe.\n\n3.\n\nAccess to Social Services\n\n7.\nThe TLSS asked a number of questions about access to medical care and educational\nfacilities.    The  overall  picture  that  emerges  is  that  the  poor  have  good  access  to  health  and\neducation  establishments.  However,  households  as  a  group  have  slightly  worse  access  then\nhouseholds  elsewhere  in  the  country.  These  differences  are  not  great,  according  to  the  PIA\nsurvey, and may not be statistically significant.\n\n8.\nThe surveys undertaken under the PIA confirm that people using the project road have\ngood access to health and education facilities.  Among passengers surveyed, 73 percent said\nthat the school was less than a kilometer from their house. Virtually all passengers reported that\ntheir  children  walked  to  school,  and  90  percent  said  it  took  less  than  30  minutes.  In  terms  of\n                                                \n2 Republic of Tajikistan State Statistical Agency. 1999. Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Dushanbe.\n3    The State Statistical Agency poverty line is estimated to be TJR 20,000 per person per month.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\naccess  to  medical  care,  the  TLSS  indicates  that  for  most  households,  access  (measured  by\ntime)  was  relatively  easy.    However  access  was  slightly  less  easy  for  people  in  Khatlon,  with\nnearly  70  percent  of  individuals  in  the  poorest  households  travelling  for  30  or  fewer  minutes,\ncompared with over 80 percent for individuals in the rest of the country.\n\nAccording  to  a  survey  by  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO),4  overall  infant  and\n9.\nmaternal mortality levels are high due to high numbers of births and insufficient family planning.\nNinety  percent  of  women  give  birth  at  home.  The  reason  given  was  insufficient  transportation\nfrom distant villages to larger towns. These results are at variance with the results of the TLSS\nand  the  PIA  surveys.    Part  of  the  reason  for  the  difference  is  that  the  poor  were  under-\nrepresented  among  the  passengers  using  the  main  project  road,  i.e.,  the  subject  of  the  PIA\nsurvey. Improving the rural road network to lower the cost of transport would help alleviate these\naccess problems.\n\n4. \n\nAccess to Transport Services in the Project Area\n\n10.\nBased  on  the  PIA  survey,  outside  of  Dushanbe,  60  percent  of  drivers,  farmers,  and\npassengers  using  the  transportation  markets  in  the  project  area  are  poor,  compared  with  91\npercent of the people in the region. In general, the characteristics of the poor respondents did\nnot  differ  substantially  from  those  of  the  overall  group,  although  the  poor  owned  and  used\npassenger  vehicles  much  less  than  the  nonpoor,  and  the  poor  used  buses  much  more\nfrequently. Farmers, traveling as passengers, most often brought their produce to market using\nbuses or minibuses.\n\nC. \n\nPoverty Impact of the Project\n\n11.\nInfrastructure  projects  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  direct  and  indirect\nbenefits.  Direct  benefits  are  concerned  with  improving  access  to  economic  and  social\nopportunities,  including  labor  and  product  markets,  and  enhancing  human  capital  formation,\nespecially  education  and  health.  Indirect  benefits  involve  increasing  efficiency  of  resource\nallocation, especially the performance of markets, flexibility of adjustments, and the fostering of\neconomic growth.\n\n12.\nThe  Project  comprises  three  components  that  impact  on  poverty  reduction:  (i)\nrehabilitation  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road,  (ii)  improvement  of  rural  roads,  and  (iii)  policy\nreform. Rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road is of strategic significance to the national\neconomy and is likely to stimulate regional and national income growth. The improvement of the\nrural roads is likely to make only a modest contribution to national income growth, but is likely to\nhave a direct and significant impact on the daily life of the poor in the project area. Policy reform\nwill enhance the direct and indirect impact of the road rehabilitation and improvement.\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Impact of the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab Road Rehabilitation\n\n13.\nThe PIA survey interviewed passengers, farmers, and drivers. The results suggest that\n60  percent  of  the  users  and  drivers  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab  road  are  poor.  The  poor  use\nbuses more often than higher-income passengers. Their frequency of travel overall appears to\nbe about the same as the higher-income passengers. Over three quarters of passengers using\nthe  project  road  are  men.    The  occupational  profile  of  the  poor  passengers  did  not  differ  from\nthe  higher-income  passengers.    About  20  percent  of  the  poor  passengers  reported  working  in\nthe private sector, 20 percent for the government, 6 percent were housewives, 6 percent were\n                                                \n4 NGO Household Livelihood Security Assessment. 2000. Dushanbe.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nstudents, 10 percent were pensioners, and 6 percent were jobless. The average age of the poor\npassengers  was  41,  about  the  same  as  for  all  passengers.  Poor  passengers  had  a  slightly\nhigher average household size (nine people) than passengers as a whole (eight people).\n\nThe results of the survey of farmers suggested that about 60 percent were poor.  About\n14.\n20  percent  said  they  sold  their  produce  locally  and  did  not  use  motorized  transport  to  reach\nmarkets.    This  proportion  also  applies  to  poor  farmers.    About  70  percent  of  the  farmers  said\nthey sold their produce more than once a week, and about 70 percent said they did not use an\nintermediate dealer because they were not satisfied with the prices these dealers offered.  All\nusers of motorized transport lease vehicles to bring their produce to market. The average age\nfor all farmers was 41, and 80 percent were male. This was about the same for poor farmers.\n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact of the Rural Road Improvement\n\n15.\nThe Project will improve about 150 km of local, rural, and farm roads in Khatlon Region.\nLocal roads are secondary roads linking settlements to the national roads. Rural and farm roads\nare small roads linking farms to each other and linking large farms to local roads. Usually, rural\nand farm roads have a gravel or dirt surface and are quite rough. Local roads are larger than\nrural  roads  and  often  have  asphalt,  concrete,  or  a  smooth  gravel  surface.  Usually  no  public\ntransport services exist on rural roads and traffic of motorized vehicles in general is low. Local\nroads  usually  have  transport  services  (both  private  and  public),  but  their  frequency  and\navailability vary greatly.\n\n16.\nThe local, rural, and farm roads (henceforth referred to as rural roads) to be included in\nthe Project will be identified by the consultants and approved by the Government and the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  in  accordance  with  selection  criteria  focusing  on  poverty  and  social\nconsiderations,  traffic  levels,  costs  and  economic  returns,  sustainability  issues,  and  links  to\nother relevant projects in the project area. The Government has agreed to selection criteria for\nthe  rural  roads  (Appendix  6).  Small  and  medium\u2013size  holders  will  be  involved  in  the\nidentification of the rural roads to be rehabilitated in order to encourage active participation and\naddress  their  needs.  In  addition,  provincial  officials  responsible  for  the  education  and  health\ndepartments will be consulted to address any issues concerning access to health centers and\neducation.\n\n17.\nThe primary benefits that farmers in the project area will experience from improvement\nof the rural roads will be (i) reduced loss of produce due to poor conditions of the roads, and (ii)\nincreased  income  due  to  increasing  competitiveness  among  traders  arising  from  improved\naccess  to  rural  areas.    Surveys  indicate  that  the  most  important  transport\u2013related  problems\nfaced by poor farmers are the cost and availability of transport services, and lost income from\ndamage to agricultural produce caused by bad road conditions. All farmers interviewed by both\nthe  PIA  survey  and  the  appraisal  survey  stated  that  transport  services  account  for  almost  20\npercent  of  the  final  price  they  receive  in  the  market.  In  addition,  transport  services  in  Khatlon\nRegion  are  of  low  quality  due  to  inadequate  maintenance  of  vehicles  and  lack  of  spare  parts.\nThe  resulting  infrequent  and  unreliable  transport  services  cause  farmers  to  spend  long  hours\nwaiting. On average, farmers indicate losing 15 percent of their agricultural profit due to damage\ncaused  by  bad  conditions  of  the  roads  leading  to  markets.    Poor  farmers  said  they  lost  20\npercent of their agricultural profit due to bad conditions on these roads.\n\n18.\nFarmers interviewed for the PIA either sold their produce locally (without making use of\nmotorized  transport) or  they sold their produce to wholesale traders who, in turn, brought it to\nthe market.  About 70 percent of farmers said they did not use traders because they were not\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 16, page 5\n\nsatisfied with the prices traders offered (on average, 50 percent less than prices in the markets).\nIn  general,  however,  farmers  prefer  using  traders  rather  than  make  the  long  and  expensive\njourneys to the markets themselves.\n\n3.\n\nPoverty Impact of the Policy Component\n\n19.\nSince  independence,  Tajikistan  has  made  substantial  progress  in  increasing  the\ncompetitiveness  of  transport  markets.  However,  the  Government  still  maintains  a  presence  in\nproviding transportation services. The drivers\u2019 survey indicates that the Government\u2019s role as a\ndirect provider of transport services does limit competition, and limited competition will result in\nsome share of the benefits of the Project not being passed on to consumers. If the current state\nof competition prevails, a portion of the savings in vehicle operating costs will not be passed on\nto  passengers  but  will  be  divided  between  the  Government  and  the  private-sector  vehicle\nowners.  The  surveys  reveal  that  several  institutional  barriers  prevent  transport  markets  from\nbeing  more  competitive.  Both  the  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  the  road  rehabilitation  project\nwould be greatly enhanced if the transport market becomes more competitive, and drivers and\nvehicle owners pass on most of their cost savings to transport users in the form of lower fares\nand  freight  rates.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  commercialize  all  road  transport  service\noperations,  excluding  large-scale  urban  ones,  and  privatize  25  percent  of  the  operations  by\nproject  completion.  This  process,  which  will  include  the  ending  of  mandatory  tariffs  for  freight\nand  passenger  operations,  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of  transport  markets  and  help\nensure that project benefits are passed on to the poor.\n\n4. \n\nDistribution of Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n\n20.\nThe  estimated  direct  benefits  of  the  trunk  road  to  the  economy  as  a  whole  are  $8.0\nmillion  in  present  value  (PV)  terms.  This  simply  represents  the  sum  of  the  PV  of  benefits  to\npassengers,  freight  users,  vehicle  owners,  and  the  Government.  This  is  a  conservative\nestimate, because only direct benefits of the Project are considered. Table A16.2 presents the\nestimated benefits for each of the categories of beneficiaries.\n\nTable A16.2: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n($ million)\n\nYear\nNPV\nProportion of Poor (%)\nBenefits to Poor\nPoverty Impact Ratio\nNPV = net present value.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nPassenger\nUsers\n4.130\n60\n2.478\n\nFreight\nUsers\n1.947\n60\n1.168\n\nVehicle\nOwners\n5.578\n30\n1.673\n\nGovernment\n(3.612)\n10\n(0.361)\n\nTotal\n8.044\n\n4.959\n0.62\n\n21.\nThere  will  also  be  indirect  benefits,  such  as  the  increased  trade  and  economic  activity\nthat  are  partly  induced  by  the  improved  road.  The  size  of  these  indirect  benefits  depends  on\nhow  the  regional  and  national  economies  grow  over  the  Project's  time  horizon.  These  indirect\nbenefits will impact the poor in two ways: first, by creating job and other economic opportunities;\nand second, given the Government\u2019s commitment to maintain a budget allocation of 37 percent\nfor  overall  social  sector  expenditure,  the  tax  revenue  arising  from  the  generated  economic\nactivity will provide more funding for social services.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 16, page 6\n\nThe PIA study computed the poverty impact ratio (PIR) for the Dushanbe\u2013Khulyab road\n22.\nbased on the present value of the benefits. This is the proportion of project benefits that accrue\nto  the  poor.  The  PIR  is  0.62  indicating  that  62  percent  of  the  net  project  benefits  reach  poor\nusers. For the very poor, the PIR is estimated at 0.10, or 10 percent of the net project benefits.\nA sensitivity analysis of the PIR is shown in Table A16.3.\n\nTable A16.3: Poverty Impact Ratio\n\nItem\nBase Case:\n     With normal competition in the transport sector\nSensitivity Analysis:\n     With low competition in the transport market\n     With high competition in the transport market\nNote:\n\nPoor (%)\n\nVery Poor (%)\n\n62\n\n44\n80\n\n10\n\n 2\n15\n\nThe PIR was calculated assuming that 10 percent of the Government\u2019s net benefits (costs) will be incurred\nby the poor, while the very poor do not incur any of the Government\u2019s expenditure.\n\nThe  PIR  increases  with  increases  in  competition;  the  higher  the  level  of  competition  in\n23.\nthe  transport  markets,  the  higher  the  PIR  is  for  both  targeted  categories,  poor  and  very  poor\npeople. This illustrates the importance of enhancing competition in the transport market not only\nto fuel economic growth but also to help reduce poverty. With higher competition in the transport\nmarket, drivers and vehicle owners will pass on most of their cost savings to transport users in\nthe  form  of  lower  fares  and  freight  rates.  Consequently,  to  the  extent  that  transport  costs  will\nlower  the  cost  of  delivering  agricultural  products  to  the  market,  these  cost  savings  will  be\npassed on to consumers.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 1 September 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\n        TJR 1.00\n            $ 1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Tajik Ruble (TJR)\n$0.000511\nTJR1,958\n", "The exchange rate of the Tajik ruble prevailing at the time of project appraisal, $1.00 = TJR1,958,\nis used in this report.
