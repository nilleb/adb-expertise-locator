The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2. \nSRCIP will improve the road connectivity and efficiency of the international trade corridor \nby expanding about 500 kilometers (km) of roads in the North Bengal and Northeastern Region \n(NB-NER)  of  India.  The  project  area  under  SRCIP  is  a  key  strategic  thoroughfare  integrating \nSouth  and  Southeast  Asia,  and  bordering  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Myanmar,  and  Nepal. \nImprovements in road connectivity in NB-NER will enable efficient and safe transport within India \nand  regionally  with  other  SASEC  member  countries.1 Ultimately,  SRCIP  will  pave  the  way  from \nIndia and other South Asian countries to Myanmar, and further afield to link with the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). SRCIP was endorsed by the SASEC trade facilitation and \ntransport working group meeting in Singapore on 30 October 2013. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale     \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAlthough South Asia is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world, intra-\nregional trade is still only some 2% of total trade, compared with 25% in ASEAN, 40% in North \nAmerican  Free Trade  Agreement countries,  and  63%  in the  European  Union. While free trade \nmovements  are  being  agreed  and  implemented,  investment  needs  to  be  stimulated  through \nimproved road and cross-border connectivity, particularly in less developed areas like NB-NER.  \n \n4. \nRoad  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  among  SASEC  countries,  accounting  for  65%\u2013\n70% or more of freight movement. Since most trade between India and its neighbors is by road, \nthe  role  of  road  transport  is  expected  to  increase  with  development  and  the  easing  of  cross-\nborder trade restrictions. Trade between SASEC countries via India to Myanmar and Thailand is \ncurrently  by  sea,  which  makes  exchanges  slow  and  expensive,  especially  for  landlocked \ncountries and NB-NER. Cross-border trade by road between India and Myanmar comprises only \n1.5% of the total road-based cross-border trade of Myanmar ($1.1 billion), against 70% with the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  26%  with  Thailand.  Industry  estimates  suggest  that  improved \nconnectivity through the India\u2013Myanmar\u2013Thailand trilateral highway could increase India\u2019s trade \nwith ASEAN to about $100 billion by 2020.  \n \n5. \nOne  of  the  major  constraints  for  regional  connectivity  is  the  \u201clast-mile\u201d  connectivity \nbetween the in-country trunk road network and neighboring countries, which is often left out of \ndevelopment plans. This is the case in NB-NER where the in-country trunk road has four-lanes \nand  is  mostly  in  good  condition  under  the  government\u2019s  National  Highway  Development \nProgram  (NHDP)  while  extensions  from  the  trunk  road  to  neighboring  countries  are  generally \nnarrow two-lane roads in poor condition. The annual average traffic on these last-mile stretches \nis  generally  20,000\u201330,000  passenger  car  units  along  the  trunk  road  to  only  3,000\u20139,000 \npassenger  car  units  near  the  border,  mainly  because  of  the  limited  road  capacity  which  is \nexacerbated by cross-border transport inefficiency. In general, the road network capacity in NB-\nNER is limited by geographic constraints, limited availability of land, and increased congestion. \nSecurity  concerns  in  border  areas  also  lower  network  utilization.  Nonetheless,  improving \n\n                                                \n1  Comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n\n\fconnectivity in NB-NER is the key to regional integration of South and Southeast Asia. Improved \nroad  capacity  and  conditions,  along  with  easing  of  cross-border  movement  restrictions,  will \nincrease  trade  and  the  resultant  traffic  and  network  utilization,  and  will  ultimately  improve  the \nsecurity situation in the region and cross-border transport efficiency.  \n \n6. \nFour  regional  platforms  involving  India  provide  strategic  direction  for  regional  transport \nconnectivity: (i) Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC),2 (ii) South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), (iii) SASEC, and \n(iv) the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). \nThe  UNESCAP  Asian  Highway  Network  provides  interregional  priority  roads  for  South  Asia, \nwhile  the  SAARC  highway  corridors  provide  intra-subregional  priority  roads  for  South  Asia. \nBIMSTEC has developed a policy framework and strategy for regional connectivity. \n \n7. \nInvestment in last-mile connectivity is in line  with the  central government\u2019s prioritization \nof the non-NHDP network, which contributes directly to regionally balanced and inclusive growth \nfor remote, economically lagging or challenging regions. During the Five-Year Plan, FY2012\u2014\nFY2016 3 the  broad  assessment  of  investment  needs  for  the  non-NHDP  network  with  state \npublic  works  departments  is  about  Rs570  billion,  out  of  which  Rs74  billion  is  expected  to  be \nmobilized  from  the  private  sector  and  Rs108  billion  will  be  an  external  assistance  loan.  The \ncentral  government  is  also finalizing  a  regional  road  connectivity  program  (Fostering  Regional \nConnectivity:  Widening  and  Upgrade  of  Highways  Along  the  International  Borders).  This \nprogram  targets  1,000  km  at  a  cost  of  about  Rs65,000  million.  Financing  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) can be effectively utilized for last-mile connectivity to strengthen both \nintra-SASEC  and  SASEC\u2013Myanmar  connectivity  by  leveraging  public\u2013private  partnership \nprojects undertaken for the trunk road network under the NHDP.  \n \n8. \nADB is supporting the development of major international roads in neighboring countries, \nand  strengthening  customs  systems.  Land  customs  stations  with  Bhutan,  Bangladesh, \nMyanmar, and Nepal are under development with support from the respective governments and \nADB.4 SRCIP is part of the critical development for regional connectivity. \n \n9. \nIndia\u2019s road sector faces several issues, including inefficient implementation, poor road \nasset management, high incidence of road accidents, and vehicle overloading. The government \nis  confronting  these  deficiencies  through  various  initiatives  and  support  from  development \npartners.  For  national  highways,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  National  Highway  Interconnectivity \nInvestment Program is expected to provide substantial support to the Ministry of Road Transport \nand  Highways  (MoRTH)  to  implement  contracting  and  institutional  reform  measures  and  to \ndevelop  sector  policies  with  emphasis  on  road  safety.  For  state  road  agencies  in  NB-NER, \nincluding  Manipur  Public  Works  Department  (MPWD),  which  will  implement  state  roads \nimprovement  under  SRCIP,  capacity  development  support  is  ongoing  through  technical \nassistance  together  with  the  ADB-assisted  Northeastern  State  Road  Investment  Program5 for \nroad asset management, road safety quality systems, and institutional strengthening. \n \n10. \nSRCIP will include the first stage of the government regional connectivity program. The \nplanned  investments  under  SRCIP  underline  the  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries \n\n                                                \n2  Comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. \n3  Government of India.

Manila (Loan 2770, TA 7838, and TA 8063). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f(Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Nepal,  and  Myanmar).  Subprojects  being  considered  under  SRCIP \ninclude improvement to roads covering last-mile connectivity in the states of West Bengal and \nManipur. The road map of the investment program also includes improvement to state roads in \nManipur to avoid congestion, taking into account expected increases in international traffic, and \nprovision of alternate routes to national highways for greater access to isolated border areas. \n \n11. \nNB-NER  is  an  underdeveloped  region.  Improved  connectivity  to  NB-NER  for  regionally \nbalanced and inclusive growth would be well served by the envisaged subprojects under SRCIP. \nThese subprojects will bring new wealth to NB-NER, providing alternative optimal routes for NB-\nNER to reach the established deep water seaports in Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar. These \nroutes are along Asian Highways 1, 2, and 48; and overlap with SAARC highway corridors, and \ntheir  extensions  and/or  alternates.  The  investment  program  may  cover  additional  routes  to \nprovide  regional  connectivity  among  SASEC  and  with  Myanmar.  Traffic  through  Manipur  and \nWest  Bengal  is  expected  to  increase  substantially  because  of  improved  access  to  and  from \nother  Indian  states,  and  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries\u2014transforming  NB-NER  into  a \nregional trading hub. \n \n12. \nTransport  infrastructure  development  is  the  government\u2019s  high  priority,  making  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  of  reducing  poverty  through  infrastructure-led  growth  especially  relevant.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support for regional connectivity is in line with  its India country partnership strategy, \n2013\u20132017.6 SRCIP  has  been  designed  in  coordination  with  development  partners  to  avoid \noverlaps, and continues ADB support for implementation efficiency of road agencies in parallel \nwith  improvement  to  last-mile  connectivity  for  regional  cooperation.  Recommendations  by  the \ncountry  partnership  strategy  final  review  validation  report  (footnote  6)  have  been  taken  into \naccount, e.g., enhancing project readiness and engaging consultants for project implementation \nsupport.  SRCIP  is  also  relevant  to  the  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  in  South  Asia,  2011\u2013\n20157 aimed at improving subregional connectivity and promoting intraregional trade.  \n \nThe  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA) 8  details  the  road  map,  strategic  context, \n13. \npolicy  framework,  and  investment  program.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  best  suited  for  the \ninvestment  program,  which  has  multiple  executing  agencies,  by  allowing  ADB  to  enter  into  a \nsustained  and  planned,  yet  flexible  partnership,  with  the  central  government  for  a  long-term \ninvestment  in  regional  connectivity\u2014in  parallel  with  continued  support  for  implementation \nefficiency improvement.9 Different levels of progress in project preparation by different agencies \ncan  be  well  managed  by  the  phased  approach  of  the  MFF.  Lessons  learned  for  a  new \ncontracting  initiative,  including  performance-based  maintenance,  can  be  incorporated  in \ntranche 2.  Preparation  can  be  undertaken  under  tranche  1  for  tranche  2  subprojects  and  a \nplanned  central  government  program  to  develop  regional  connectivity.  A  solid  pipeline  of \nregional connectivity projects encourages contractors to invest in projects in remote areas.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  domestic  and  regional  trade  through  NB-NER.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  road  connectivity  and  efficiency  of  the  NB-NER  international  trade \ncorridor. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2013.

SRCIP  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade \nabout  500  km  of  regional  connectivity  roads,  which  are  part  of  the  Asian  Highways,  SAARC \nHighway Corridors, or their alternate routes. It will cover both national highways and state roads. \nThe  upgrading  will  be  mainly  two-laning  with  paved  shoulders,  together  with  safety  features \nincluding  construction  of  overpasses  at  busy  junctions  and  bypasses  for  smooth  traffic.  Some \nsections  will  be  widened  to  four  lanes  to  serve future  traffic.  Performance-based  maintenance \nwill be undertaken for 5 years after construction. The engineer will be engaged for engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) contracts; and the construction supervision consultants for \nitem-rate contracts. In addition, the implementation support consultant (ISC) will be engaged to \nsupport the executing agencies in (i) external safeguard monitoring, (ii) third-party quality check \non  maintenance,  (iii)  road  safety  audit,  (iv)  financial  management,  and  (v)  preparation  for \nsubsequent submission of periodic financing requests to ADB. \n \n16. \nCapacity  development  and  implementation  support  of  Manipur  Public  Works \nDepartment. SRCIP will provide capacity development of MPWD, together with implementation \nsupport,  especially  in  strengthening  financial  management  systems  and  managing  larger \ncontracts  with  performance-based  maintenance.  This  will \nfocus  on  subproject \nimplementation in Manipur, and roll over to the state road network systems. \n \n17. \nTranche  1 outputs. Tranche 1 will adopt the sector modality to finance (i) upgrading of \nroad  subprojects  totaling  about  300  km,  including  implementation  support,  given  the  highest \npriority because of their significant regional impacts; and (ii) MPWD capacity development and \nimplementation support. The road subprojects include (i) 37 km of Asian Highway 2 connecting \nBangladesh, India, and Nepal, and 97 km of Asian Highway 48 connecting Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nand India, and Bangladesh; and (ii) about 130 km of state roads extending the connection with \nMyanmar. The first two subprojects (Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48), which have the \nmost  challenging  features,  have  been  appraised.  Other  road  subprojects  will  be  appraised  for \nADB approval during implementation of tranche 1, following the selection criteria and approval \nprocess (according to the FFA, schedule 4). All subproject roads are of a similar nature to the \nlast-mile connectivity. \n  \nD. \n  \n18. \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $761.6  million,  including  five-year \nperformance-based  maintenance,  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest, \nand other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \n19. \nThe  central  government  has  requested  an  MFF  in  an  amount  of  up  to  $500.0  million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help finance  a part  of  the  investment  program.10 The \nMFF  will  consist  of  several  tranches,  subject  to  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and \nfulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the FFA. For each tranche under \nthe  MFF,  MoRTH  will  receive  a  portion  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  through  the  budgetary \nallocation.  Under  current  policies  of  the  central  government,  the  state  government  of  Manipur \nwill receive 90% of the remaining portion as a grant from the central government as Manipur is a \nspecial category state. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans        \n\n                                                \n10  Financing includes part of customs and duties amounting to about $88 million. The estimated expenditure is not \n\nexcessive (15% of ADB loan resources) and will apply only with respect to ADB-financed expenditures. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n20. \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  will  be  financed  by  a  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  use  a  sector  modality;  and  has  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility,11 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program ($ million) \n\nItem \n  \n  \nA.

The recommendations of the road safety audit were incorporated in the \ndesign.  As  part  of  road  sector  reform  initiatives,  national  highway  stretches  will  be  taken  up \nunder the EPC mode, including five-year performance-based maintenance, so that a part of the \ndesign  and  completion  risk  is  transferred  on  to  the  EPC  contractor  to  gain  design  and \nimplementation  efficiencies.  State  highways  will  be  contracted  as  item  rate  contracts  using \nADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  with  modification \ninclude  performance-based \nmaintenance. \n \nB. \n \n24. \n\nThe economic assessment for subprojects (Asian Highways 2 and 48) was carried out in  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nto \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 13  The  principal \nbenefits  calculated  are  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time.  The  estimated \neconomic internal rates of return are 22.4% for Asian Highway 2 and 16.3% for Asian Highway \n48.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  project  roads  have  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn  above  12%  even  with  adverse  variation  in  costs  and  benefits,  so  the  proposed \nimprovements  are  economically  viable.  In  addition  to  the  quantified  benefits,  the  project  will \nbring  significant  benefits  to  overall  regional  trade  among  SASEC  countries.  Incremental \nrecurrent  costs  associated  with  all  possible  subprojects  under  SRCIP  are  estimated  at  about \n1.5% of the current MoRTH and 3.3% of the MPWD maintenance budget on an annual basis, \nwhich  are  likely  to  be  provided  by  both  agencies  without  difficulties.  The  initial  five-year \nmaintenance has been budgeted under the investment program.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  indicated  that  MoRTH \nand  MPWD  have  adequate  capacity  in  financial  management  for  ADB-financed  projects. \nMoRTH has established financial management systems in the regional offices and regional pay \nand accounts offices to account for and report on the project expenditure. MoRTH\u2019s capacity is \nbeing strengthened by the World Bank, including development of  enterprise resource planning \nsystems  and  a  financial  management  manual.  MPWD\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  ISC, \nespecially  in  initial  computerization  of  financial  management  systems  and  strengthening  the \naudit  review  mechanism.  The  investment  program  will  also  provide  training  and  support  to \nMPWD on ADB procedures and financial management systems.    \n  \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \n26. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended from  time  to  time),  include a  policy  statement  on \navoiding  corrupt  practices,  and  ensure  compliance  with  core  labor  standards.  Information \nrelating to the investment program will be published on the MoRTH and MPWD websites. The \ngovernment  has  started  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  for  government \ndepartments and ministries (including MoRTH) to assess key governance indicators. Parliament \nis  considering  bills  on  public  procurement,  whistleblower  protection,  and  prevention  of  money \nlaundering.  MoRTH  and  states  have  started  road  sector-specific  initiatives  such  as  the \nintroduction  of  a  longer  defect  liability  period  and  new  procurement  modes  such  as  EPC, \nperformance-based  maintenance  and  e-procurement.  MoRTH-wide  enterprise  resource \nplanning, supported by the World Bank, and computerization of financial managements systems \nin  state  road  agencies,  supported  by  ADB,  will  also  help  enhance  good  governance.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ncentral  government,  the  state  government  of  Manipur,  and  state  government  of West  Bengal; \nand  MoRTH,  MPWD,  and  the West  Bengal  Public Works  Department  (WBPWD). The  specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM.  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nFor  Asian  Highway  2  and  Asian  Highway  48,  the  subproject  impact  area  can  be \ncharacterized  by  a  predominance  of  traditional  farming,  and  lack  of  road  connectivity  at  the \ndesired  level\u2014causing  limited  access  to  health  care,  educational  institutions,  commercial \nfacilities, and government development agencies. Respondents engaged during the poverty and \nsocial survey expressed that they could not reap the benefits of locational advantages because \nof inadequate road connectivity despite proximity to bordering nations and other Indian states. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fHalf  of  the  working  population  is  self-employed  in  trade  and  business,  including  cross-border \ntrade. Agriculture, non-farm labor, and the service sector each account for an equal proportion \nof workers while about 11% are engaged by tea gardens. The work participation ratio is 37% for \nmen  and  31%  for  women  of  working  age.  A  more  efficient  road  network  will  provide  stronger \nlinks  between  remote,  poor  regions,  and  more  developed  markets  both  within  India  and  at  a \nsubregional  level,  and  thus  improve  the  socioeconomic  situation  and  enhance  poverty \nreduction. The improvement will directly benefit about 1.3 million people in the project area. \n \nGender.  Women  in  Asian  Highway  2  and  Asian  Highway  48  project  areas  are  mainly \n28. \ninvolved  in  household  work,  cultivation,  working  in  tea  estates,  and  other  farming  activities. \nWomen  indicated  that  improved  road  conditions  and  connectivity  will  provide  better  access  to \nhealth  services,  higher  levels  of  education,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  interactions. \nMitigation and proactive key actions for tranche 1 include (i) constructing over 30 km of paved, \nraised sidewalk in urban areas that will be highly beneficial to pedestrians, elderly, women, and \nchildren;  (ii)  encouraging  civil  works  contractors  to  engage  women  workers  as  wage  laborers \nand  ensuring  equal  pay  for  equal  work;  and  (iii)  providing  awareness-raising  seminars  for \ncontractors,  construction  workers,  and  women  in  the  project  areas  on  HIV/AIDS,  health  and \nhygiene,  road  safety,  and  human  trafficking.  The  implementing  agencies  and  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will monitor the implementation. \n \nHIV/AIDS and trafficking. The Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48 subproject area \n29. \nis characterized by increasing rates of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, with \nconcentrated epidemics. Based on the assessment, the National AIDS Control Organization of \nthe  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family Welfare and  the  State  AIDS  Prevention and  Control  Society \nare  tasked to provide  medical  and health  services,  public  awareness raising  and  social  sector \nservices, and monitoring. The state governments have set up the District AIDS Prevention and \nControl  Unit  to  provide  more  targeted  interventions  to  high-risk  groups,  and  an  integrated  and \naugmented  system  of  prevention,  care,  support,  and  treatment  at  the  district  level.  Based  on \nexisting government initiatives, mitigating measures are in place to address all health and social \nrisks  and  impacts  associated  with  infrastructure  development  in  the  project  area.  The \nimplementing  agency  and  PIU  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  conduct  awareness \nprograms  in  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  child  labor  at  construction  camp  sites  and \nworkplaces. All contracts will have clauses on these initiatives, and the state governments will \nmonitor  compliance during  implementation.  A  nongovernment  organization (NGO)  will  conduct \nawareness programs in HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking in project-affected communities. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Tranche  1  is  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  investment  program  was \ndeveloped  to  minimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Two \ncombined resettlement and indigenous peoples plans have been prepared for Asian Highway 2 \nand  Asian  Highway  48.  These  were  approved  by  ADB  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  A \ntotal  of  9.05  hectares  of  private  land  will  need  to  be  acquired  at  replacement  cost.  Some \n4,132 households  will  be  affected,  occupying  3,578 structures.  A  total  of  489  households  will \nexperience  physical  displacement,  1,944 households  will  experience  economic  displacement, \nand  354 households will  experience both physical  and economic  displacement. The  displaced \nhouseholds will  be  entitled to  compensation for  the  loss  of  land  and structures  at  replacement \ncost,  shifting  cost,  and  other  income  restoration  assistance.  Resettlement  for  the  two  roads  is \nestimated to cost about $12.5 million. The implementing agency and/or the PIU is experienced \nwith  the  land  acquisition  process  and  implement  the  land  acquisition.  The  PIU  will  be  staffed \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fwith  experienced  social  safeguard  personnel,  with  a  resettlement  officer  to  oversee  each \naffected district. An experienced NGO will be engaged by the PIU to implement the resettlement \nplan  for  each  subproject.  A  resettlement  framework  was  approved  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  for  the  investment  program,  under  which  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the \nrelevant  executing  agency  for  each  subsequent  subproject,  with  resettlement  impact,  and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Tranche  1  is  categorized C for  indigenous  peoples.  In the  Asian \nHighway  2  and  Asian  Highway  48  project  areas,  135  indigenous  peoples  households  will  be \nimpacted  by  involuntary  resettlement.  The  census  found  that  these  households  are  not \ndistinctive because they are integrated with the dominant population of the project area. Tribal \ngroups  in the  subproject  areas  freely  interact  with the  outside  community.  These  groups  have \nnuclear  families,  and  are  open  to  new  ideas  like  family  planning  and  formal  education.  Social \nimpact assessments confirm that the socioeconomic impacts caused by the subprojects will not \nbe  different  for  these  people  when  compared  with  the  remainder  of  the  population.  Two \ncombined  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  two \nsubprojects.  Adequate  compensation  provisions  are  made  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  was  prepared.  In  accordance \nwith  the  framework,  if  any  significant  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  identified  in  the \nsubsequent subprojects, the relevant executing agency will prepare an indigenous peoples plan \nand submit it to ADB for approval.  \n \n32. \nEnvironment.  Tranche  1  is  categorized  category  A  for  environment  since  one  of  the \nsubproject  roads  passes  through  a  national  park  with  critical  habitat  areas.  A  consolidated \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for  both  Asian  Highway  2  and  Asian  Highway  48  has \nbeen  prepared.  The  draft  EIA  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  9  August  2013.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was  prepared  to  guide  compliance \nwith environmental safeguard requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of \nEnvironment  and  Forests,  the  central  government,  and  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  in the \nsubsequent subprojects. Anticipated significant environmental impacts from the two subprojects \nentail  disruption  of  wildlife  migratory  routes,  disturbance  to  wildlife,  and  removal  of  a  large \nnumber of trees. Mitigation and environmental enhancement measures, including modifications \nto  the  technical  design  of  the  road  to  address  these  impacts  and  ensure  no  net  loss  of \nbiodiversity,  have  been  included  in  the  subproject  designs.  Other  anticipated  impacts  entail \ntypical road construction-related issues such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from \nconstruction  and worker  camps,  water  contamination,  occupational  health and  safety,  erosion, \nand  siltation.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  these  have  been  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan, which will be implemented by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have \nbeen held with affected persons and other key stakeholders, such as national park officials and \nthe World Wildlife Fund, while preparing the EIA. Technical recommendations from park officials \nand the World Wildlife Fund have been incorporated in the EIA. Concerns of affected persons \nand relevant stakeholders will continue to be addressed during project implementation through \nthe grievance redress mechanism proposed in the EIA. \n \nThe environmental capacity of the executing and implementing agencies will need to be \n33. \nstrengthened during project implementation. An authorized officer for environmental safeguards \nwill  be  appointed  at  the  executing  agency  level  and  an  environmental  focal  person  at  the \nimplementing  agency  and/or  PIU  level.  The  PIU  will  carry  out  internal  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation  of  environment  safeguards  while  the  ISC  will  perform  external  monitoring.  For \nenvironment category A and B subprojects, another external monitoring agency will be engaged \nto  conduct  third-party  monitoring.  An  initial  coordination-cum-training  workshop  will  be \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nconducted by the implementing agency, with technical support from ADB. The ISC or ADB will \nconduct on-the-job training as necessary during project implementation.  \n \nF. \n \n34. \nmitigating measures are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.14  \n \n\nThe key risks are delays in implementatioin and sustainability (Table 4).

MoRTH  will  set  up  PIU  for \nnational  highways  in  Manipur  to  supplement  MPWD  capacity  and  streamline  the  decision-\nmaking process. MPWD increased its staff for the investment program. \nAdverse  impacts of  land  acquisition, social,  and  environmental  impacts  have  been minimized \nby  undertaking  all  engineering  measures  and  consultation.  Works  contracts  will  be  awarded \nonly  after  substantially  completing  safeguard  requirements.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  for \nimplementation  support.  Before  commencing  construction,  a  due  diligence  mission  will  be \nfielded to confirm that rights-of-way to be handed over to contractors are free of encumbrances; \nand create awareness among project authorities of ADB\u2019s social safeguard requirements. \nA  five-year  performance-based  maintenance  will  be  adopted.  The  appropriate  budget  was \nprovided under the investment program.
