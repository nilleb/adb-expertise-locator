THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation to support a major \nchange in scope of the Supply Chain Finance Program (SCFP). This entails: \n(i)  the incorporation on a permanent basis of the following changes to the program, \noriginally approved on a temporary basis as part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s  \n(ADBs) Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic:1 \n(a)  approval to enter into equitable assignments of trade receivables, trade \ncredits, and trade-related loans;  \n(b)  waiver  of  the  requirement  for  the  Investment  Committee  to  approve \npartner financial institutions (PFIs) to work with the SCFP where such PFIs \nhave previously been approved by the Investment Committee to work with \nthe Trade Finance Program (TFP); and  \n(ii)  the ability to undertake unfunded risk participations in working capital loans and \nguarantees each with a maximum tenor of 12 months.  \n \n2.  The proposed mainstreaming of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) specific scope \nchanges will reduce small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing gaps and support their \ngrowth in developing member countries (DMCs) by: (i) broadening private sector support for \nsupply chain finance and working capital facilities, (ii) improving cash flows to DMC companies to \nenable growth and job creation, and (iii) producing a demonstration effect that will encourage \nfinancial institutions to undertake more supply chain financing.  \n \n3.  This report and recommendation also fulfils the reporting requirement to the Board on the \nprogram\u2019s performance at intervals of no more than 3 years.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.    Background \n4.  Substantial gaps exist in financing global trade. Closing those gaps will lead to growth for \ndeveloping economies, more jobs for those who need them, and fewer people living in poverty. \nAn International Finance Corporation study found that 40% of SMEs in developing economies \nhave unmet financing needs.2 A trade finance gap survey carried out by the ADB confirmed a \nglobal trade finance gap of $1.5 trillion in 2019 and determined that 40% of this gap was in Asia \nand the Pacific, with 74% of rejected trade finance transactions coming from SMEs.3 Women-\nowned firms find it even more difficult to access finance; the survey found that among women-\nowned firms, the average rejection rate of their proposals was 44%, compared with 38% for male-\nowned firms. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the World Economic Forum estimated that the global \ntrade finance gap would rise to $2.5 trillion by 2025. However, with the adverse impact of the \npandemic, the gap is already much larger. The International Chamber of Commerce anticipates \nthat an additional $1.9 trillion\u2212$5.0 trillion is needed to support a rapid global recovery.4  \n \n \n1 ADB. 2020.

Trade Finance Gaps, Growth, and Jobs Survey. ADB Briefs No. 113. September. Manila. \n4 International Chamber of Commerce. 2020. Trade Financing and COVID-19. Paris. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  To reduce financing gaps, the ADB Board of Directors approved the launch of the SCFP \nin November 2012 with a limit of up to $200 million.5 The program was renewed in March 2018 \nwith an increased limit of $300 million and a change in scope.6  \n \n6.  Supply chain finance is the provision of finance at various stages of the supply chain. This \nallows smaller entities such as DMC suppliers and distributors to receive finance to maintain or \neven increase their production and/or sales without being constrained by having to wait for receipt \nof payments from large buyers or pay in advance for purchase of goods from large sellers. \nDepending on the stage at which such finance is provided, there are different supply chain finance \nproducts, namely pre-shipment finance, post-shipment finance, and distributor finance.  \n \n7.  ADB provides supply chain finance to suppliers, distributors, buyers, or sellers through \nPFIs only, by allowing the PFI to transfer a part of the default risk of corporates (usually 50%) to \nADB and in some cases by funding the PFI for supply chain finance loans extended by the PFI to \nits customers. This permits PFIs to reduce their capital requirements and, in certain cases, to \nremove ADB\u2019s share in the loans from their balance sheet, bringing further efficiency into capital \nallocation. The result is that PFIs have more capital resources to support SMEs in DMCs, which \ncontributes to closing market gaps, boosting economic growth, and creating jobs. The SCFP \ncomplements the TFP. A key difference, however, is that while the SCFP assumes the default \nrisk of corporates in the supply chain, the TFP assumes the risk of banks defaulting on trade \nfinance instruments. \n \n8.  Unlike the TFP (approved in 2003), the SCFP had a difficult start because ADB lacked \nexperience, risk models, risk acceptance criteria, operational procedures, and documentation to \nsupport supply chain finance. In addition to adding staff for the program, the special policy \nvariations approved under the Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (footnote \n1) have enabled the program to be better aligned with the market, resulting in heightened market \ninterest and a broader pipeline of deals. ADB now has sufficient internal infrastructure and a \nstrong growth strategy to underpin a successful supply chain finance business and to enhance its \ndevelopment impact. \n \n9.  To  scale  up  the  SCFP,  leveraging  the  TFP\u2019s  trade  finance  operations  and  strong \nrelationships with DMC banks built up through the TFP, joint efforts of the two programs were \nrebranded in 2020 as the Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP). The TSCFP \nreduces financing gaps by fostering closer engagement of the two programs and leveraging \ncommon internal resources. Notwithstanding this, the TFP and SCFP are referred to as separate \nprograms in this document. \n \nB.    Program Performance  \n10.  Utilization. Supply chain finance transactions are short-term, with an average tenor of 2 \nor 3 months, which means each dollar of the $300 million limit can be used up to four times in a \nyear. This is an efficient use of ADB\u2019s capital resources. During the reporting period (2018\u20132020), \nthe program supported 2,554 transactions (an increase of 301% over the previous 3-year period) \nvalued at $582 million (an increase of 9% over the previous 3-year period). In 2020, the program \nsupported 1,447 transactions (an increase of 151% over 2019) valued at $246 million (an increase \nof 108% over 2019); $162 million of that was cofinanced by PFIs. The program maintained this \n \n5 ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Supply Chain Finance \nProgram. Manila. \n6 ADB. 2018.

The \nprogram anticipates that the current program limit will be sufficient to accommodate growth until \nthe first half of 2023. \n \n11.  Strategy. The program\u2019s strategy is based on the following: (i) scale the SCFP by building \na strong PFI network with global and regional banks; (ii) diversify the SCFP geographically by \nbuilding the capacity of the TFP\u2019s DMC banks to develop their supply chain finance businesses \nand by increasing sectoral coverage; (iii) grow new supply chain finance markets by addressing \nregulatory  impediments  through  One  ADB  and  industry  partnerships;  (iv)  explore  new \nopportunities and collaborations with industry organizations; and (v) mobilize additional funding \nresources through risk distribution and cofinancing opportunities. \n \n12.  Sector composition, geographic composition, and support for small and medium-\nsized  enterprises.  The  program  continues  to  increase  its  sectoral  reach  to  support  the \npharmaceutical industry, medical distribution, food production, technology manufacturing and \ndistribution, and garment retail distribution. Since its inception, the program has supported supply \nchains across 10 DMCs including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. During the 3-year reporting \nperiod, the program supported 1,519 SME transactions. \n \n13.  Design and monitoring framework results. The program mostly exceeded the metrics \nset out in the design and monitoring framework appended to the program\u2019s 2018 report and \nrecommendation of the President (footnote 6). \nTable 1.

Pandemic response. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained supply chains throughout \nAsia, including for companies that manufacture and distribute food products, medical products, \nand  equipment. ADB\u2019s  Comprehensive  Response to  the  COVID-19  Pandemic  (footnote  1) \nrecognized the need to help DMCs deal with the crisis, to offset both the direct effects of the virus \nand  its  economic  repercussions.  The introduction  of  policy variations  under  the  COVID-19 \nResponse and changes in implementation arrangements for the program provided it with an \nenabling framework to support strained supply chains and respond to, or indirectly address, the \neconomic impacts  of the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In the first  12 months after the  COVID-19 \n ", "4 \n \nResponse changes were introduced (April 2020\u2013April 2021), the program experienced a 183% \nincrease in the number of transactions supported compared with the previous 12-month period.  \n \n15.  Supply chain maps for pandemic-fighting products. The TSCFP, in partnership with \nother  ADB  departments,  developed  supply  chain  maps  for  pandemic-fighting  products,  an \ninteractive tool to undertake end-to-end mapping of supply chains for critical pandemic-fighting \ngoods such as ventilators, N95 masks, and other key products.7 The tool was updated in March \n2021 to include vaccine supply chains. This initiative enables users to identify companies involved \nin each component of the supply chain, to address any bottlenecks in liquidity, and identify support \nrequired by companies in these supply chains. \n \nC.    Knowledge Products and Capacity Building for Market Development  \n16.  Although partnerships with global and regional banks under the program are producing \npositive development impacts, such PFIs tend to target more developed DMCs. To achieve \ngreater geographic diversification, the program must attract more DMC banks as PFIs in addition \nto global and regional banks. However, supply chain finance is not sufficiently understood or \ndeveloped in most DMCs to attract these DMC banks. To develop DMC banks\u2019 capacity to offer \nsupply chain finance to SMEs, capacity building and knowledge products are critical. The program \naddresses this in the following ways:  \n(i)  Supply chain finance capacity development technical assistance. Targeted \ntechnical support is being delivered to a set of TFP DMC banks that have been \nassessed  for  their capacity  and commitment  to  build  a  supply chain  finance \nbusiness. The SCFP aims to work with about 10 DMC banks from 2021 to end of \n2023  to  develop  supply  chain  finance  business  models,  with  a  view  to \nsubsequently signing risk-sharing agreements with these banks to include them as \nPFIs.  Target markets  include  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri \nLanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. The program anticipates that seven of these \nDMC banks will be onboarded as PFIs.  \n(ii)  Seminars,  webinars,  or  industry  events.  The  program  deploys  significant \nresources to deepen knowledge of supply chain finance and promote market \nawareness of how this product has the potential to reduce financing gaps. Since \n2016, the program has provided seven seminars to more than 360 bankers from \nFiji,  Kazakhstan,  Mongolia,  Thailand,  and  Uzbekistan,  and  e-training  for  380 \nbankers across 23 DMCs. In 2020, the program stepped up the pace of this \ninitiative to provide tailor-made webinars to selected TFP partner banks in DMCs \ntargeted by the program to introduce supply chain finance. As of December 2020, \nmore than 55 representatives from banks in Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and \nUzbekistan have attended these webinars. In 2021, this initiative is being rolled out \nto Cambodia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. More DMCs will be considered and included \nunder this initiative in the next 3 years. \n \nD.    Lessons Learned \n17.  Initial product range was not aligned with shifting market practices. The temporary \nchanges in scope under ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (footnote \n1) better aligned the program to the market and bolstered the program\u2019s capacity to address \nfinancing gaps. Following approval of these scope changes, the program experienced strong \ngrowth in demand, resulting in a 108% increase in the total value of transactions supported in \n \n7   ADB. 2020. Supply Chain Maps for Pandemic-Fighting Products. Manila. \n   \n ", "5 \n \n2020 compared with 2019. Continuation of some of these scope changes (listed in paras. 17 [i], \n[ii],  and  [iii])  on  a  permanent  basis  would  continue  to  fuel  program  growth  and  maximize \ndevelopment impact.     \n(i)  Equitable assignment. In 2018, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade8 \nreissued its industry standard documentation to use equitable assignments for \nparticipation in trade and supply chain finance assets, and banks have accordingly \nupdated their systems to transfer risk on an equitable assignment basis. Under \ncommon accounting standards, an equitable assignment provides a more efficient \nmechanism  to  remove  assets  from  balance  sheets,  leading  to  lower  capital \nrequirements  for  banks  and  balance sheet  efficiencies.  These  balance sheet \nefficiencies leave more capital resources for banks to support supply chain finance \nand SMEs in the value chain. As local banks look to establish supply chain finance \nprograms in DMCs, they increasingly want to adopt this approach for efficient \naccounting treatment. \n(ii)  Risk participation in working capital loans. ADB\u2019s ability to risk-participate with \nPFIs on an unfunded basis, in working capital loans and guarantees with tenors \nup to 6 months, is essential to enhancing support for transactions such as pre-\nshipment  and  export  loans.  In  many  DMCs,  supply  chain  finance  is \nunderdeveloped and is limited to banks offering simpler products such as loans \nand guarantees. For example, supplier finance is provided in the form of loans to \nbuyers,  the  disbursement  of  which  is  only  permitted  for  supplier  payments. \nFurthermore,  distributor finance is  provided  in  the form  of  portfolio loans for \nworking capital to a seller. Neither of these product variants, which can help PFIs \nroll out financing for SME suppliers and distributors at pace, could in the past be \nsupported  by  the  program.  This  ability  has been invaluable  for the  SCFP  in \naddressing working capital requirements in supply chains. It broadens the universe \nof DMC suppliers and distributors that can be supported, subject to prevailing \nregulatory environment. The program has received strong market feedback to \nconsider  increasing  the  tenor  of  the  supported  working  capital  loans  and \nguarantees to 12 months.  \n(iii)  Simplified  approval  process.  Under  the standard SCFP, ADB\u2019s  Investment \nCommittee must approve PFIs before they can work under the program. However, \nmost global and regional PFIs have already been approved under the TFP. ADB \ngains efficiencies internally and speeds up response times for clients by waiving \nthe approval process for PFIs already approved under the TFP. This waiver \nenables the program to quickly onboard qualified new banks, channel immediate \nsupport, and mobilize cofinancing with global banks and eligible counterparties. \n \n18.  There is  an opportunity  to mobilize more  cofinancing, leverage  ADB\u2019s  capital \nresources, and drive more development impact by distributing risk. Growth of the program \nin the coming years will reduce headroom under the current $300 million program limit. The \nprogram will manage the growing demand through a combination of effective limit management \nand  by  establishing  arrangements  to  distribute  risk  to  other  entities.  Cofinancing  through \ndistribution will leverage ADB\u2019s resources and help close market gaps for SMEs by crowding more \nprivate sector participation into supply chain finance, which will also result in more efficient use of \nADB\u2019s resources. The SCFP team is in discussions with insurance firms to pilot risk distribution \nstarting  from  Q3  2021.  Opportunities  to  collaborate  and  share  risk  with  other  multilateral \ndevelopment banks and development finance institutions are also being explored. \n \n8  The Bankers Association for Finance and Trade is the leading industry body for organizations engaged in \ninternational transaction banking, including trade and supply chain finance. \n ", "6 \n \n \n19.  The program can have deeper impact through geographic diversification, with a \nshift away from larger markets where global banks focus. This objective can be accomplished \nby expanding the program to include DMC banks as PFIs. However, supply chain finance either \ndoes not exist or is not well developed in most DMCs. There are two primary impediments to \nexpanding supply chain finance in DMCs: (i) legislative gaps; and (ii) understanding of supply \nchain finance among banks and companies, including SMEs. On the regulatory side, the program \nteam works with ADB resident missions and regional departments as well as with other industry \nbodies to advocate for policy reforms to establish a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment for \nsupply  chain  finance.  On  the  knowledge  and  capacity  building  side,  in  markets  such  as \nBangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam where supply chain finance products are nascent and \nglobal PFIs do not have a large footprint, the program leverages strong TFP relationships and \nprovides support to build the capacity of selected DMC banks in supply chain finance through TA \n(para. 16 [i]). It is expected that this TA will result in additional DMC banks being included in the \nprogram to share risk with ADB in supply chain finance transactions.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20.  The program has achieved the objectives set out in the 2018 report and recommendation \nof the President (footnote 6). Except as set out in para. 21 below, it is proposed that the program, \nas previously approved, remain unchanged. \n \n21.  Continuation and expansion of scope changes. Based on the positive market response \nto  the  changes  in  scope  under  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19  response,  which  enable  more  broad \nachievement of the program\u2019s design and monitoring framework outcomes, it is proposed to make \npermanent  certain  of  those  changes  and  to  further  enhance  the  program\u2019s  product  range \nas follows: \n \n(i)  Incorporation on a permanent basis of the following changes to the  program \noriginally approved on a temporary basis under ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response \nto the COVID-19 Pandemic: \n(a)  approval  to  enter  into  risk  participation  through  equitable \nassignments of trade receivables, trade credits, and trade-related \nloans. This will enable the program to remain relevant and retain its ability \nto engage with banks, which are moving their business models to the \nequitable  assignment  methodology.  This  will  provide  a  more  efficient \nprocess to use ADB support and resources for incentivizing PFIs and their \nprovision of supply chain finance in DMCs to support SMEs; and \n(b)  waiver  of  the  requirement  for  Investment  Committee  to  approve \npartner financial institutions to work with the program, where such \ninstitutions  have  previously  been  approved  by  the  Investment \nCommittee to work with the Trade Finance Program. This will enable \nthe program to maintain its agile response and allow faster mobilization of \nsupport.  \n(ii)  Expansion of the program to support unfunded risk participation in working \ncapital loans and guarantees, each with a maximum tenor of up to 12 months.  \nThis will enable the SCFP to engage with an increasing number of global and DMC \nbanks to channel financing across more targeted stages of the supply chain \nrelevant to companies in DMCs. \n   \n ", "7 \n \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  No changes are proposed to existing implementation arrangements.  \n \n23.  Reporting  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The  terms  of  the  risk  participation  or \nguarantees with a PFI or loan agreements with obligors require that audited financial statements \nand strategy updates be provided at regular intervals or as requested. ADB will conduct an annual \nreview of PFIs and obligors under the program in accordance with the Staff Instructions.9 In \naccordance with the 2018 report and recommendation of the President, ADB reports on the \nprogram to the Board at intervals of no more than 3 years (footnote 6). Accordingly, the next report \non the program will be due in 2024.10 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Address finance gaps in supply chains. Supply chain finance is a unique product that \ncan help address the trade finance gap in Asia and the Pacific, providing more timely access to \nworking capital for SMEs. The $2 trillion in financeable payables globally identified by McKinsey \n& Company illustrates the untapped potential for supply chain finance.11 With the expanded scope \nof the program, ADB support will have a greater impact and will be more market-relevant. Support \nfor SMEs under the program will help underpin economic growth and job creation in ADB DMCs. \n \n25.  Gender equality. The program aims to play a stronger role in addressing gender equality \nconstraints in supply chains, recognizing that the women\u2019s market is poorly understood and that \nlimited data exists on corporate procurement and women-owned businesses. The revised design \nand monitoring framework of the program has incorporated additional gender features that will \ncontribute to addressing these gaps, enabling an upgrade of gender categorization to effective \ngender mainstreaming.12 \n \nD.  Risks \n \n26.  The 2018 report and recommendation of the President and the associated Program Risks \naddressed key risks and mitigation measures in implementing supply chain finance with a PFI.13 \nThese included differing levels of risk exposure at various stages in the supply chain, supplier \nperformance,  obligor  credit  risk, nonperformance  of the PFI,  legal  and  documentation  risk, \nregulatory risk, operational risk, country risk, geographic and sectoral concentration risk, and \ncurrency risk.14 Given the addition of products like working capital loans, distributor finance, and \npre-shipment finance, the Program has agreed with ADB\u2018s Office of Risk Management on product \nconcentration limits to cap exposure to higher risk products. ADB\u2018s Office of Risk Management \nmust approve all obligors under the program. \n \n9  ADB. 2016. Credit and Other Processes for Nonsovereign Operations. Compendium of Staff Instructions.

Audit. ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General (OAG) audited the program in 2020. OAG \nacknowledged that the program has adequate manual controls and well-established procedures. \nAutomation through deployment of fit-for-purpose technology is a key actionable for the SCFP, \nwhich will be accomplished by 2024 for both TFP and SCFP transactions.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n28.  Impact.  The  program\u2019s  revised  impact  is  capacity  of  domestic  financial  institutions \nstrengthened to encourage and expand access to banking and financial services for all.15 This will \nbe achieved by increasing access of DMC corporates to finance through supply chain finance. \n  \n29.  Outcome. The revised program outcome is uptake of supply chain finance expanded in \nDMCs. Through a combination of knowledge products, loans, guarantees, and funded and \nunfunded risk participation, DMC SMEs and corporates will receive more financing and PFIs can \nleverage  ADB\u2019s  participation  to  broaden  their  supply  chain  finance  portfolios.  Success  in \nachieving the outcome will be measured in terms of an increase in the number and value of supply \nchain transactions supported. \n \n30.  Outputs. The program\u2019s outputs extend the capacity to provide supply chain finance, \nsupport its gender inclusivity, expand the banks\u2019 training in supply chain financing and gender \nbalance. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n31.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The program is consistent with Strategy 2030 and the \noverarching objective of achieving an Asia and Pacific region that is  prosperous, inclusive, \nresilient, and sustainable, and contributes to ADB\u00b4s Operational Priorities (OPs).16 Overall, the \nprogram facilitates trade and investment (OP7). The program focuses on strengthening the \ncapacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking and \nfinancial services in DMCs.  It has a demonstration effect on nonpartner financial institutions that \nare not yet providing supply chain finance. The program contributes to reducing poverty and \ninequalities (OP1) by providing greater access to finance for SMEs in DMCs and will create jobs, \nstimulate growth, and improve livelihoods. The program also promotes gender equality in banking \nthrough training and workshops for female bank staff in DMCs (OP2). The program is also aligned \nwith the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).17 \n \n32.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Inclusive finance is \none of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, which was reaffirmed in its \n2017  review.18One  component  of  the  strategic  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment is to mobilize third-party capital through credit enhancement products and risk \ntransfer arrangements. The program facilitates this by encouraging private sector contributions to \nsupply chain finance and enabling ADB to support SMEs. \n \n \n15 United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform.

The program will continue to be classified as category FI treated as C across all three \nsafeguard requirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Through its PFIs and \nobligors, the program will provide access to working capital for SMEs, suppliers, and distributors, \nhelping them increase production and contributing to their growth and development. The business \nactivities that will be supported by the PFIs and obligors are anticipated to have minimal or no \nadverse environmental and involuntary resettlement impacts and are unlikely to entail indigenous \npeoples  impacts.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  underlying  goods  for  each  transaction  will  not \ncontravene the excluded goods list patterned after ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. ADB \nfunds will not be used for transactions classified as category A and category B for environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  recorded  or  outstanding \nnoncompliance issues with existing safeguards and social requirements in the program. The \nprogram team and PFIs will comply with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant \nnational laws, including labor laws; will take measures to comply with internationally recognized \ncore labor standards; and will report on participants\u2019 compliance in the annual report. \n \n34.   Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  program\u2019s  revised  gender  classification  is \neffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998),19 \nthe  program  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: \n(i) improved knowledge of DMC banks participating in the ADB SCFP TA on gender lens financing \nin supply  chain finance;  (ii)  increased capability  of the  participating  banks to  apply  a sex-\ndisaggregated data system; (iii) increased number of their women staff receiving supply chain \nfinance capacity building training; and (iv) in collaboration with the TFP, the introduction of a \ntraining program focused on improving their customer service to female clientele. The program \nwill include periodic reports on implementation of gender measures in its reporting system. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n35.  PFIs and obligors (when providing direct financing) will be advised of ADB\u2019s policy of \nimplementing best international practices relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and \nthe financing of terrorism.20 ADB will ensure that the documentation includes (i) appropriate \nprovisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and \n(ii) remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n36.  The program\u2019s current financing is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n37.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),21 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that participating governments \nthat have yet to declare no objection to the proposed assistance will be asked to do so before the \n \n19 ADB. 1998.
