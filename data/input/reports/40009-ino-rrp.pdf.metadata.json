The Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a steep decline \nin  overall  development  spending,  and  particularly \ninfrastructure \ninvestments.  Since  1998,  private  sector \ninvestment  has  almost \ndisappeared. At the same time, the Government realized that the public \nsector  had  borne  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  risks  in  the \ninfrastructure  sectors,  and  stopped  providing  any  risk-sharing  support. \nAs a result, Indonesia has lost its place as one of the top performers in \nterms  of  infrastructure  provision  in  the  Southeast  Asian  region.  With \ninfrastructure  investments  currently  at  around  2%  of  GDP,  about  50 \nmillion people (or more than 20% of the population) do not have access \nto treated water, 90 million are without electricity, and about 200 million \nwithout  fixed  telephone  lines  or  connections  to  a  sewerage  network. \nThe  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  lack  of  access  to  basic \ninfrastructure services. Availability of services is generally lower in rural \nareas,  particularly  outside  Java  and  Bali,  contributing  to  significant \nregional disparities in development. \n \nThe Government estimates that about $65 billion will be needed in new \ninfrastructure investments over the next 5 years, with $25 billion (38%) \nto  be  met  from  the  government  budget;  $14  billion  (22%)  by  domestic \nbanks,  and  insurance  and  pension  funds;  $10  billion  (15%)  by \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners; and $16 billion (25%) by \ndomestic and foreign private sector investors. \n \n\n\f \n  Impact and \n  Outcome \n\n \nThe Program Loan \n    Impact and \n    Outcome \n\nii \n\n \n\ntaken \n\nIRSDP, \n\nformulated  at \n\ninfrastructure  sectors.  The \n\nGiven  the  weak  investment  climate,  the  Government  recognizes  that \nfor  granted,  and  serious  structural  and \nPSP  cannot  be \ninstitutional  reforms  are  needed.  At  the  January  2005  Indonesia \nInfrastructure  Summit,  the  Government  announced  its  commitment  to \npromote  PSP  and  identified  91  potential  infrastructure  projects.  It  has \nsince introduced several critical measures to strengthen the regulatory \nand institutional framework for PSP. The February 2006 comprehensive \nInfrastructure Policy Package outlines the short-term reform agenda in \nvarious \nthe \nin  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  and \nGovernment\u2019s  request \ndevelopment partners, is based on this agenda and extends it over the \nmedium term.        \n \nThe  IRSDP  will  improve  the  investment  climate  and  support  timely \nrealization of the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic goals, in \nparticular  achieving  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  6%\u20137%  during \nto, \n2005\u20132009, \ninfrastructure.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  IRSDP  is  accelerated \ninfrastructure development through large-scale PSP and mobilization of \nadditional public sector resources. \n \n \nThe program loans for the IRSDP support three key reform pillars: \n \n(i) \n\nthrough  enhanced  provision  of,  and  access \n\nStrategic cross-sectoral reforms resulting in \n(a) \n\nimproved  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  frameworks  for \ngreater PSP anchored on good governance principles; \n(b)  a  well-structured  risk  management  framework  to  promote \n\nPSP; \n\n(c)  accelerated  mobilization  of  domestic  long-term  financial \nresources  for  infrastructure  development  through  public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) projects; and  \n\n(d)  a  streamlined  regional  autonomy  framework  delineating \nfunctional  responsibilities  for  infrastructure  provision  by \nnational and local governments. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii)  \n\nSector-specific  reforms  for  transportation,  power,  oil  and  gas, \nwater supply and sanitation, and telecommunications leading to \n(a) \n\nfinancial  soundness  and  sustainability  of \n\nimproved \ninfrastructure services through full cost recovery; \n\n(b)  greater  competition  that  benefits  consumers  by  improving \n\nservices and lowering tariffs; \nindependent  regulatory  structures  that  are  distinct  from \ncontracting and operating functions;   \n\n(d)  equal  access \n\nfor  all  participants/investors,  and \n\nthe \n\nprevention of abuse of natural monopoly rights; and \nfulfillment  of  public  service  obligations  of  infrastructure \nservice  providers,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction objective.  \n\n(c) \n\n(e) \n\nFacilitation  of  the  preparation  and  execution  of  well-structured \nmodel PPP projects that can be replicated. \n\n\fiii \n\nFor  subprogram  1,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a \nloan  of  $400  million.  The  Government  envisages  support  from  ADB  of \naround  $300  million\u2013$400  million  for  each  of  subprograms  2  and  3, \nwhich  will  be  reconfirmed  during  IRSDP  review  and  processing.  The \nGovernment  has  requested  the  Government  of  Japan  and  the  World \nBank  to  cofinance  the  IRSDP;  this  is  being  considered  by  the \ndevelopment partners. \n \nA  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  for \nsubprogram  1  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment \ncharge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement.  \n \nSubprogram  1  was  implemented  from  January  2005  to  September \n2006, and all actions included in the policy matrix under subprogram 1 \nare complete. Subprogram 2 will be implemented from October 2006 to \nJune 2008, and subprogram 3 from July 2008 to March 2010. All three \nprogram loans will be disbursed in single tranches upon declaration of \ntheir effectiveness. \n \nThe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  under  the \noverall  coordination  of  the  National  Committee  on  the  Acceleration  of \nInfrastructure  Development  (KKPPI)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency. \nBAPPENAS  will  closely  collaborate  with  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of \nEconomic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the concerned line ministries \nin executing the IRSDP. The line ministries and agencies will implement \nthe reform actions.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.  \n\nThe project loan is to help accelerate PSP in Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure \nsectors. Establishment of the PDF will alleviate one of the most critical \nconstraints  impeding  infrastructure  development,  namely,  the  lack  of \nadequate  project  preparation.  The  PDF  will  help  the  Government  (i) \nprepare feasibility studies for national and decentralized PPP projects; \n(ii)  adopt  open  and  transparent  bidding  processes;  and  (iii)  execute \nproject  transactions.  Resources  will  be  allocated  through  a  national \ncomponent  of  the  PDF  focusing  on  large  national  projects,  and  a \nregional  component  of  the  PDF  supporting  smaller  decentralized \nprojects of local governments.  \n\n  Program \n  Investment Plan \n \n\n \n  Financing Plan \n\n \n  Program Period \n  and Tranching \n\n \n  Executing \n  Agency \n\n \n  Procurement \n\n \nThe Project Loan  \n  Impact and \n  Outcome \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n  Financing Plan \n\n \n  Executing \n  Agency and \n  Implementation \n  Arrangements \n\n \n  Consulting \n  Services and \n   Procurement \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\nin \n\nincluding  senior  representatives  of \n\nthe  draft  Project  Loan  Agreement.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  fixed  term  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, a 1% interest charge during the grace period, \nand  1.5%  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set \nforth \nloan  will  be \nsupplemented  by  a  $7.6  million  grant  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands to be administered by ADB. Disbursement procedures will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \nBAPPENAS will be Executing Agency for the Project. The head of the \nDirectorate  for  PPPs  in  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  overall  project  director \nfor  the  PDF  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  A  project  management  unit \nwill  be  established  to  administer  the  PDF.  For  the  local  government \nprojects,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  BAPPENAS  deputy  for \ninfrastructure  affairs  and \nthe \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nline  ministries,  plus  a \nthe  concerned \nof  Home  Affairs,  and \nrepresentative  of  the  associations  of  regional  governments  (on  a \nrotational basis), will be created. The Project will be implemented over 5 \nyears. \n \nAbout  552  person-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  3,401 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The \nconsultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurements Guidelines. \n \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB  for  TA  support  for  (i)  effectively \nimplementing  the  risk  management  framework  adopted  under  the \nIRSDP;  (ii)  establishing  various  infrastructure  funds,  with  focus  on \nensuring  their  fiduciary  governance;  (iii)  developing  an  effective \ncommunication  strategy  and  social  marketing \nto  disseminate \ninformation and build support for reforms; and (iv) ensuring the quality \nof projects at entry to the PDF. The total cost of the TA is estimated at \n$2,500,000,  of  which  $2,000,000  will  be  provided  as  a  grant  from  the \nADB-funded TA funding program. \n \nThe IRSDP\u2019s expected benefits include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nsustained  progress \nthe  Government\u2019s \nin  meeting \nmacroeconomic  objectives  articulated  in  its  Medium-\nTerm Development Plan for 2006\u20132009; \nimproved investment climate resulting from sound policy, \nlegal,  and  institutional  frameworks  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors; \ngreater  PSP  and  a  more  systematic  approach  for \nimplementing  PPP \nfocusing  on  good \ntransactions \ngovernance; \na transparent and prudent risk-sharing system; \nquality  infrastructure  projects  prepared  and  executed \ntransparently and expeditiously, resulting in (a) improved \navailability  and  quality  of  infrastructure  services,  (b)  a \nboost to Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness versus its regional \n\n\fv \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nneighbors, and (c) lower poverty incidence; \nsustained engagement by ADB in policy reforms over the \nmedium term to strengthen the investment climate; and \naid  harmonization  by  the  primary  development  partners \n(ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon policy framework, and the positive externalities \nresulting  from  joint  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nreform agenda. \n\nInterest.  Progress \n\n \nin \nLack  of  Coordination  and  Conflict  of \ninfrastructure  reforms  in  the  past  was  impeded  by  the  lack  of \ncoordination  among  line  ministries  and  competing  and  conflicting \ninterests  of  various  stakeholders.  In  particular,  bureaucratic  as  well  as \npolitical  economy  factors  prevented  restructuring  of  key  infrastructure \ninstitutions and sector liberalization. Vested interests may still continue \nto oppose transparent bidding processes and favor politically connected \nentities. Such interests may exert pressure on the Government to share \nrisks  in  an  imprudent  manner,  or  circumvent  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  to  prevent  large-scale  PSP.  Recognizing  past  deficiencies, \nthe  Government  has  adopted  a  sound  legal,  regulatory,  and  risk \nmanagement framework and coordination mechanism to promote PSP, \nand  is  committed  to  introducing  competition  and  reducing  the  costs  of \ninfrastructure  provision.  The  IRSDP  will  help  reduce  the  risks  and \npromote  PPPs  by  (i)  leveraging  reforms  that  improve  the  investment \nclimate  to  meet  the  medium-term  growth  objectives,  including  the \nadoption of institutional mechanisms to coordinate PPP projects at the \noversight  and  line  ministry  levels;  (ii)  supporting  the  determination  of \nrisk  sharing  in  a  prudent  and  transparent  manner;  and  (iii)  bringing  as \nmany high-value projects as possible for open and transparent bidding \nand execution.   \n  \nPoor  Governance  and  Corruption.  With  the  high  stakes  involved  in \nlarge  infrastructure  projects,  the  IRSDP  faces  significant  risks  in  the \nform  of  weak  governance,  collusion,  and  corruption.  Such  problems \nhave  been  common  in  the  past  in  Indonesia.  However,  during  the  last \nyear  the  Government  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anticorruption \nefforts.  Procurement  reforms  have  been  under  way  for  some  time, \nresulting in competitive and relatively transparent selection of bidders by \nthe public sector. The PSP regulatory framework, adopted as part of the \nIRSDP,  sets  out  clear  guidelines  for  the  selection  of  private  sector \nsponsors. The National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure \nDevelopment is tasked with ensuring that bidding processes are fair and \ntransparent. The President has enhanced the profile and activities of the \nAnti-Corruption  Commission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies \nconsiderably. These steps are already having an impact.       \n \nSocial Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and \nIndonesia  is  no  exception.  As  the  country  gradually  moves  away  from \nthe  current  system  of  administered  tariffs  for  infrastructure  services, \nsocial  tensions  will  be  inevitable.  However,  the  savings  from  the \nreduction in inefficient subsidies will enable the Government to reorient \nits  public  expenditures  to  poverty  reduction,  employment  generation, \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fand rural infrastructure development. \n\n \n\nAdverse  Domestic  and  Regional  Economic  Developments.  PSP \ncould  be  impeded  by  domestic  macroeconomic  volatility,  lack  of \nsustained momentum on policy reforms, or adverse regional events that \nhave a contagion effect on the Indonesian economy. Over the last few \nyears, the Indonesian economy has been quite resilient to domestic and \nexternal  shocks.  The  Government  has  begun  adopting  wide-ranging \nreforms to address investors\u2019 concerns.  \n \nHeightened Security Alerts Stemming from Sectarian and Regional \nConflicts,  and  Security  Concerns.  The  Government  and  its  law \nenforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of  effective  measures \nagainst such conflicts that could slow private investment, and to rebuild \npublic and investor confidence.  \n\nvi \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (IRSDP)  in  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  comprising  three  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for subprogram 1 of the IRSDP; (iii) a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for \nthe  establishment  and  operation  of  an  Infrastructure  Project  Development  Facility  (PDF);  (iv) \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Participation  (PSP)  in \nInfrastructure  Provision;  and  (v)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Netherlands for the PDF. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nUntil the 1997 financial crisis, Indonesia successfully used infrastructure development to \naddress  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development.  However,  infrastructure  investments, \nwhich accounted for more than 6% of annual gross domestic product (GDP) before 1997, have \nfallen  to  2%  in  recent  years,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  public  and  private  spending.  The \nfinancial crisis greatly aggravated the situation; many planned public and private infrastructure \nprojects  were  canceled  or  suspended.  Since  1997,  only  some  basic  preservation  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure, with very little expansion, have taken place.  \n \n3. \nCurrent  infrastructure  service  coverage  in  Indonesia  is  low  by  regional  standards.  In \n1996, Indonesia outperformed the People\u2019s Republic of China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand in terms \nof  overall  infrastructure  quality.  However,  by  2004  these  countries  had  overtaken  Indonesia, \nwhich ranked 64th of the 80 countries surveyed.1 About 50 million people lack access to treated \nwater,  90  million  to  electricity,  and  close  to  200  million  do  not  have  direct  access  to \ntelecommunications  or  connections  to  a  sewerage  network  (Box  1).  The  poor  suffer \ndisproportionately from lack of access. Moreover, the generally lower availability in rural areas, \nparticularly outside Java and Bali, contributes to significant regional disparities in development. \n \nWhile the financial crisis impeded development and growth in all of Southeast Asia, it is \n4. \nnot  the  sole  reason  for  the  poor  state  of  infrastructure  sectors  in  Indonesia.  Supported  by  the \neconomic  boom  prior  to  the  crisis,  investment  decisions  under  the  New  Order  regime  were \nmade  on  the  basis  of  political  connections,  rather  than  a  clear  and  impartial  judgment  of  the \nassociated risks, benefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a disproportionate \nshare of the risks. In addition, no concerted effort was made to address the various policy, legal, \nand institutional impediments facing the infrastructure sectors. Subsequent governments during \n1998\u20132004 were burdened with the more urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and fiscal \nconsolidation.  Efforts  were  directed  to  mitigate  risks  by  renegotiating  major  infrastructure \ncontracts signed before the crisis. Initial steps were also taken to put in place an interministerial \nmechanism to coordinate infrastructure development. \n \nFollowing  Indonesia\u2019s  first  direct  presidential  elections  in  October  2004,  the  current \n5. \nGovernment  set  ambitious  macroeconomic  targets  for  the  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \n(RPJM: 2005\u20132009) to be achieved by 2009: (i) accelerate GDP growth from 4.5% in 2004 to \n7.6%  (with  an  annual  average  of  6.6%),  (ii)  increase  the  investment/GDP  ratio  from  20.5%  in \n\n                                                 \n1   World Economic Forum. 2004. Global Competitiveness Report 2004\u20132005. Geneva. In 2006, this ranking changed \nto  89th  out  of  the  125  countries  surveyed  in  terms  of  basic  infrastructure  provision,  in  relation  to  Thailand  (38), \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (60) and Sri Lanka (76).

Geneva.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2003 to 28.4%, (iii) reduce the unemployment rate from 9.7% in 2004 to 5.1%, and (iv) halve the \npoverty rate from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2%. The Government recognizes that major infrastructure \nexpansion  is  required  to  remove  existing  bottlenecks,  increase  service  coverage,  and  attract \nprivate sector investment to help achieve and sustain the projected economic growth.  \n \n\nBox 1: Provision of Infrastructure in Indonesia \n\n  \nIndonesia,  which  outperformed  its  regional  neighbors  in  infrastructure  provision  until  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis, now lags far behind. Annual public and private infrastructure investments as a share of \nthe  gross  domestic  product  declined  to  1%  in  2000  from  more  than  6%  in  the  early  1990s,  before \nrecovering to around 2% in 2005. Foreign investments in productive sectors also declined. The gaps in \ninfrastructure provision and access are significant: \n\n \n\u2022  Roads. Indonesia has the lowest road density in the region of 0.19 kilometer (km) per square \n\nkm or 1.7 km per 1,000 people. \n\n\u2022  Power.  The  State  Electricity  Corporation  connected  on  average  about  1  million  new \ncustomers per annum during 1974\u20132004. With more than 90 million people still lacking access \nto  electricity,  Indonesia  will  be  unable  to  meet  its  90%  electrification  target  for  2020  unless \ninvestments are restored and the connection program is accelerated.  \n\n\u2022  Water  supply  and  sanitation.  Only  about  40  million  people  or  18%  of  the  population  are \nconnected to a piped water supply; even in urban areas only 33% have access to piped water. \nIndonesia  has  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  urban sewerage  coverage  in  Asia.  As  a  result,  the \nincidence of waterborne diseases is high, and diarrhea is the second largest cause of death \namong young children. Indonesia is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goal target \nnumber 10. \n\n\u2022  Telecommunications. Access is among the lowest in the region, with only about 4 fixed lines \n\nper 100 people, compared to 18\u201320 fixed lines elsewhere. \n\n \nSource: ADB staff \n\n \nIn  early  2005,  the  Government  estimated  that  about  $145  billion  would  be  needed  for \n6. \ninfrastructure  expansion  during  2005\u20132009.  Since  then,  based  on  updated  assessments  and \nmore realistic forecasts of potential investment flows, it has revised the estimate down to about \n$65 billion, with $25 billion (38%) to be met from the Government budget, $14 billion (22%) by \ndomestic banks and insurance and pension funds, $10 billion (15%) by multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners, and $16 billion (25%) by  domestic and foreign private sector investors. \nWith investments at this level, infrastructure investments would again reach about 5-6% of GDP, \nconsidered to be the minimum required to restore precrisis levels of infrastructure provision and \nsupport RPJM targets. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  PSP  cannot  be  taken  for  granted,  unless  serious \nstructural and institutional reforms are implemented. Broad-ranging policy reforms are critical to \nimprove the investment climate, including (i) liberalizing markets to allow competition and entry \nby  new  service  providers,  (ii)  improving  legal  and  regulatory  certainty  and  strengthening \nregulatory arrangements, (iii) introducing tariff regimes based on full cost recovery or providing \ncompensation  to  meet  public  service  obligations  (PSOs),  and  (iv)  establishing  effective \nmechanisms for dispute resolution. In January 2005, the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit (IIS) \nprovided  a  platform  for  the  Government  to  articulate  its  commitment  to  reform.2  This \ncommitment, together with a list of short-term actions, is recorded in the  Declaration of Action \non Developing Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships approved at the IIS.  \n\n                                                 \n2   More  than  700  delegates  attended  the  IIS  representing  the  public  and  private  sector,  development  partners,  civil \nsociety,  and  media.  The  Government  was  represented  by  the  President,  vice  president,  and  all  ministers \nconcerned with infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n8. \nIn January 2005, at the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting, following the IIS, the \nGovernment  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  infrastructure  reforms  over \nthe  medium  term,  and  thereby  help  implement  the  RPJM.  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  policy \ndialogue with the Government and  other principal development partners since early 2005. For \nthe IIS, ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank jointly \nprepared six policy briefs on issues and constraints facing the main infrastructure sectors, and \non recommendations for reform. Subsequently, in May 2005 the Government of Indonesia and \nthe  Government  of  Japan  jointly  adopted  the  Strategic  Investment  Action  Plan  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate. The plan includes many infrastructure-related actions. Building on these, the \nGovernment  has  taken  a  range  of  initial  critical  steps  to  set  the  pace  for  reform.  In  February \n2006,  the  Government  released  the  Infrastructure  Policy  Package,  based  on  work  by  the  line \nministries,  oversight  agencies,  ADB,  Government  of  Japan,  and  World  Bank.  The  package \ndescribes 50 actions completed in 2005, and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. \n \n9. \nThe  IRSDP,  using  the  Infrastructure  Policy  Package  as  its  anchor,  extends  the  2005\u2013\n2006  actions  until  2009.  The  Government  will  announce  this  medium-term  reform  agenda  to \ninvestors at the second IIS, scheduled for November 2006. Given the centrality of infrastructure \nreforms for the RPJM, the Indonesia Government has asked the Government of Japan and the \nWorld Bank to cofinance the IRSDP, which they are currently considering. \n \n10. \nAs part of the discussions on ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program for Indonesia for \n2006\u20132009, the Government asked ADB to work toward a credible medium-term commitment of \nresources  to  support  one  of  the  proposed  main  areas  of  engagement,  namely,  infrastructure \nand infrastructure services. The IRSDP structure as a program cluster is intended to provide an \noverall  umbrella  for  that  kind  of  commitment.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress,  the  three \nsubprograms will be phased at intervals of about 21 months.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n11. \nBroad-based  economic  liberalization  and  restructuring,  followed  by  fiscal  consolidation, \nhave enabled Indonesia to resume steady economic growth. After the post-crisis contraction of \nnegative 13.1% in 1998 and 0.8% in 1999, real GDP growth rose to 5.6% in 2005. During the \nsame  period,  the  overall  budget  deficit  declined  from  around  4%  of  GDP  to  0.5%,  and  the \noutstanding debt stock fell from around 100% of GDP to 45%. In March and October 2005, the \nGovernment  increased  domestic  oil  prices  by  49%  and  126%.  In  previous  years,  Indonesia\u2019s \nnational  budgets  allocated  $4  billion\u2013$7  billion  per  annum  for  inefficient,  untargeted  fuel \nsubsidies to cushion domestic consumers from the higher global oil prices. The sharp reduction \nof  the  fuel  subsidies,  which  became  unsustainable  at  the  $60\u2013$70  per  barrel  world  market \nprices,  created  additional  fiscal  space,  facilitating  a  reorientation  of  public  spending  to  meet \nessential education, health, and infrastructure needs.  \n \n12. \nThe  primary  infrastructure  issues  and  constraints  are  discussed  in  Appendix  2.  All \nsectors lag Indonesia\u2019s neighbors in terms of service coverage and their investment needs are \nmuch  higher  than  the  public  sector  can  mobilize  on  its  own  (Appendix  2,  Figure  A2).  This \nunderlines the need for prioritization, with public sector resources used for basic infrastructure \nsuch as rural roads, rural electrification, and water supply and sanitation in rural and low-income \nurban areas, i.e., interventions of a noncommercial nature that have a strong impact on poverty \nreduction. Financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners should be used for this \npurpose  as  well.  The  development  partners  will  also  play  an  important  role  in  helping  the \nGovernment create a conducive environment for large-scale PSP that is crucial for meeting the \nmassive  investment  requirements,  and  attract  private  sector  investment  to  public-private \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\npartnerships  (PPPs)3  for  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects.  The  IRSDP  will  help \nIndonesia realize the potential for PSP and leverage public sector resources to reduce service \ncoverage gaps. \n \n\na. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Impediments \n\n13. \nCross-Sectoral Framework for PSP. PSP in infrastructure sectors reached about $1.5 \nbillion  in  1994,  well  below  the  public  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  of  about  $8.0  billion. \nBoth peaked in 1996, with PSP accounting for $6.5 billion of the total investment of $16.0 billion. \nThis  was  followed  by  a  sharp  downturn  after  1997.  To  revive  private  investments  in \ninfrastructure, an effective legal framework is critical. The presidential decree, issued after the \nonset  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  did  not  meet  this  purpose.4  Although  it  defined  PSP  and \ncalled  for  the  selection  of  private  sector  sponsors  through  open  and  transparent  bidding,  the \ndecree  adopted  a  simplistic  approach  and  left  many  critical  questions  on  the  PPP  scope, \nimplementation, performance norms, tariffs, and dispute resolution unanswered. In the absence \nof  an  overall  infrastructure  law,  a  revision  of  this  decree  is  considered  to  be  the  best  way  to \nprovide an adequate legal framework.  \n\n \n\nSector-Specific  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The \n\n14. \nlegal  and  regulatory \nframework  is  complex  in  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  sectors.  The  division  of  responsibilities  for \nthe  five  principal  functions\u2014policy  making,  sector  planning,  regulation,  contracting,  and \noperation\u2014currently differs from sector to sector (Table 1). While the line ministries in charge of \ninfrastructure5 are uniformly responsible for policy making and sector planning, they sometimes \nalso  have  regulatory  responsibilities.  In  other  cases,  they  have  partly  or  fully  delegated  this \nresponsibility  to  recently  established  regulatory  bodies  that  still  report  to  the  minister  and  are \nfunded from the line ministry budget. In some cases, the regulatory bodies also have contracting \nfunctions.  In  other  cases,  the  contracting  function  is  undertaken  by  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs)  that  are  the  main  operators  in  the  sector.  Two  issues  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  the \nappropriate  role  of  the  state  and  SOEs  in  the  policy  making,  planning,  regulatory,  contracting, \nand operator functions; and (ii) the need for equal opportunities for private sector operations. \n \n15. \nSOEs  have  a  pervasive  role  across  all  the  sectors  and  dominate  sea  and  air \ntransportation, railways, and electricity. Private enterprises have to compete with these SOEs, \nwhich tend to be better established. Telecommunications is an exception, and the Government \nis committed to enhancing competition by moving away from the current duopoly in the market. \nFour of the nine sectors have established nominally independent regulatory authorities, though \nthey report to the concerned line ministries and some perform contracting functions. In essence, \nthe plethora of agencies involved and their complex interrelationships in sector functions have \n\n                                                 \n3  PPPs are contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector party for the private delivery of \npublic  infrastructure  services.  They  range  from  service  contracts  to  management  contracts  to  leases  to \nconcessions,  such  as  build-own-operate-transfer  contracts,  to  divestiture  and  build-own-operate  contracts,  and \nfrequently  involve  complementary  investments  and/or  services.  Examples  include  private  investments  in  power \ngeneration that are complemented by public investments in power transmission and distribution; involvement of a \nstrategic private investor in the implementation and operation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state \ngas  corporation;  implementation  of  a  network  of  feeder  roads  or  provision  of  land  by  the  public  sector  to \nsupplement a privately financed and operated toll road; provision of airside facilities (such as runways and aprons) \nby the public sector with private investors providing landside facilities (such as terminals and their operation); and \nprovision  of  port  infrastructure  by  the  public  sector  with  a  private  investor  being  awarded  a  concession  for  port \noperation. \n\n4  Presidential Decree 7/1998 on Cooperation between the Government and Private Companies in the Development \n\nand/or Management of Infrastructure.  \n\n5  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  for  oil,  gas,  and  power;  Ministry  of  Public  Works  for  roads,  water \nsupply, and sanitation; Ministry of Transportation for ports, airports, and railways; and Ministry of Communications \nand Informatics for telecommunications. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nstymied reforms and made coordination difficult. A thorough review of the regulatory framework \nis essential, followed by changes over the medium term to enhance efficiency.  \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Sector Regulatory Frameworks \n \n\n \nSector \nLand Transport \n\nPolicy Making \nand Planning \nMOT  \n\n \nRegulator \nMOT \n\nToll Roads \n\nRailways \n\nMPW \n\nMOT  \n\nBPJT (not fully \nindependent) \nMOT \n\nPorts and Airports \n\nMOT  \n\nMOT \n\nMEMR \nMEMR \n\nPower \nOil and Gas \n(upstream) \nOil and Gas \n(downstream) \nTelecommunications  MOC \n\nMEMR \n\nWater Supply and \nSanitation \n\nMPW \n\nMEMR \nMEMR \n\nMEMR and \nBPH Migas \nBRTI (not fully \nindependent) \nBPP-SPAM \n(not fully \nindependent) \n\n \nContracting \nMOT and local \ngovernments \nBPJT \n\nPT KAI \n\nMOT, local \ngovernments, and \nSOE \nPT PLN \nBP Migas \n\nBPH Migas \n\n \n\n \nOperator \nLocal governments, SOE, and \nthe private sector \nGovernment, SOE, and the \nprivate sector \nSOE monopoly (contracting \nonly through the SOE) \nMOT, local governments, and \nSOE monopoly (contracting \nonly through the SOE) \nSOE monopoly, but with IPPs  \nSOE and the private sector \n(open competition) \nSOE and the private sector \n(open competition) \nSOE and the private sector \n(open competition) \n\nLocal Governments  SOE and the private sector \n\n(open competition) \n\nBPJT  =  Indonesian  Toll  Road  Authority;  BP  Migas  and  BPH  Migas  =  gas  contracting  and  regulatory  bodies;  BPP-\nSPAM  =  National  Water  Regulatory  Agency;  BRTI  =  Indonesian  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Body;  IPP  = \nindependent  power  producer;  MCI  =  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Informatics;  MEMR  =  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nMineral  Resources;  MOT  =  Ministry  of  Transport;  MPW  =  Ministry  of  Public  Works;  PT  KAI  =  Indonesian  Railway \nCorporation; and PT PLN = State Electricity Corporation. \nNote: Ports do not include shipping, and  airports do  not include  civil  aviation.

An important prerequisite \n16. \nfor PSP is adequacy and consistency of information needed for investment decisions. This has \nbeen  constrained  by  (i)  lack  of  resources  for  sector  planning;  and  (ii)  line  ministries  and \ncontracting agencies not focusing on, or providing adequate resources for, project preparation \nbecause  of  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  the  crisis,  Indonesia  had  a  well-established  system  for \npreparing  annual  and  medium-term  sector  plans  that  identified  targets  for  infrastructure \nprovision  and  developed  investment  plans  for  achieving  the  targets.  However,  due  to  lack  of \nresources  for  plan  preparation\u2014and,  more  importantly,  for  actual  public  investment  in \ninfrastructure\u2014planning  capacity  in  some  sectors  was  eroded.  Sector  development  plans \ndescribing long-term physical expansion and sector blueprints outlining long-term vision in terms \nof  restructuring  and  competition  should  be  prepared  or,  if  already  available,  updated.  To \naccomplish this, the planning functions and capacity of line ministries need to be strengthened, \nin accordance with the gradual shift in the role of the Government from service provider to policy \nmaker, planner, coordinator, and facilitator. Strong central coordination is essential to ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across infrastructure sectors and efficient use of available funds by \nthe line ministries. \n \n17. \nLack of capacity and resources and the absence of a systematic process have also led \nto  lack  of  attention  to  project  preparation.  While  the  budget  system  does  allow  line  ministries \nand agencies to obtain some resources for preparing feasibility studies, the widespread view is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthat for PPP projects, this work should be done by the private sector sponsors. Once projects \nare  identified  and  some  preparation  done,  the  critical  steps  of  procurement  and  transaction \nexecution also generally suffer from resource constraints.  \n \n18. \nLack  of  a  Sound  Risk  Management  Framework.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, \nunsolicited  project  proposals  from  politically  connected  private  sector  parties  created  large \npublic  sector  liabilities  that  were  highlighted  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  particularly  in  the \npower  sector.  Now  the  Government  is  very  cautious  in  offering  support  to  private  sector \ninvestors.6  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  importance  of  adequate  risk \nmitigation  and  sharing  to  attract  large-scale  PSP.  A  sound  investment  climate,  supported  by \nreduced  investor  perception  of  corruption,  would  be  the  best  risk  mitigation  mechanism.  This \nwould  entail  continuous  and  sustained  policy  reforms  that  lead  to  a  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment, well-functioning judicial system, independent and technically sound regulation, full \ncost recovery in infrastructure services (or a well-targeted output-based subsidy where the full \ncost  recovery  would  make  such  services  unaffordable),  and  open  access  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors.  During  the  transition  before  these  ideal  conditions  are  achieved  and  confidence  fully \nrestored,  private  investors  will  ask  for  government  support  to  help  mitigate  risks  that  are  not \nunder  their  control.  The  principal  lesson  is  that  the  previous  practice  of  blanket  guarantees \nshould not be repeated. The various risks in each sector and for each project type need to be \nidentified,  and  then  allocated  to  the  party  that  can  best  control  them.  No  universal  solution  is \napplicable  to  all  situations,  and  the  range  of  possible  solutions  is  wide,  depending  on  the \nspecific circumstances of each case. The provision of adequate resources to SOEs to fulfill their \nPSOs may be one natural way of mitigating the potential default risk of those entities. The other \nimportant lesson is that risk allocation should not be rigid. Risks should gradually be transferred \nfrom the public sector to private investors as conditions improve, until market instruments rather \nthan government guarantees can be used for risk hedging. \n\n \n19. \nLack of Adequate Cost Recovery. Given the multiplicity of agencies involved and with \nSOEs  playing  a  key  role  in  many  sectors,  tariffs  are  usually  administered  for  infrastructure \nservices. Most notably for power, oil and gas, air transport, and water supply, national or local \nparliamentary approval or presidential regulations with parliamentary consensus are needed for \ntariff increases. Indonesia has done quite well in the power, and oil and gas sectors. However \nprices are still not on par with international prices for oil and gas and do not reflect actual costs \nfor electricity as they are not subject to automatic adjustments. The average electricity tariff was \nincreased by 29% in 2000, 17% during July-October 2001, and through quarterly adjustments of \n6%  each  during  2002\u20132003.  These  increases  brought  the  average  tariff  from  about \n$0.025/kilowatt-hour (kWh) after the Asian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major \naccomplishment  and  proof  of  the  successful  socialization  by  the  Government  in  this  highly \nsensitive  area.  Since  then,  the  average  tariff  has  decreased  to  $0.062/kWh  due  to  rupiah \ndepreciation  and  changes  in  the  consumption  structure.  The  Government  increased  fuel  oil \nprices by 29% and 126% in March and October 2005, respectively, reducing a major distortion \nthrough a bold move. Clearly, tariffs should follow the full cost recovery principle to encourage \ngreater PSP and enhance efficiency in the allocation of resources. At the same time, the ability \nof the poor to pay for infrastructure services needs to be considered. \n\n                                                 \n6  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  capacity  expansion  by  independent  power  producers  helped  attract  major  private \ninvestments and thereby eliminate power shortages in Southeast Asia. However, the financial crisis highlighted the \nrisks of the then prevailing long-term take-or-pay contracts indexed to exchange rates, namely, the so-called triple \nmismatch.  The  currency  mismatch  resulted  from  the  use  of  foreign  exchange  to  implement  projects  generating \nrevenues  in  local  currency.  After  the  currency  meltdown  in  Indonesia,  passing  the  foreign  exchange  risk  on  to \nconsumers  was  impossible  and  the  Government  had  to  bail  out  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN).  The \nmaturity  mismatch  was  attributable  to  the  use  of  short-term  loans  for  some  capital-intensive  projects  with  long \nservice lives. And, finally, the capacity mismatch resulted from a conversion of the previous power shortages into \nsignificant surpluses, partly because of capacity overcontracting and partly due to the slowdown in demand growth \nin the aftermath of the crisis.  \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n20. \nFailure  to  Achieve  Equity  and  Efficiency:  Public  Service  Obligations.  Full  cost \nrecovery  can  only  be  achieved  gradually  over  time.  Even  in  the  long  term,  low-income \ncustomers may not be able to pay for infrastructure services, and there are limitations on cross-\nsubsidization by more affluent customer categories. The current situation differs from sector to \nsector, with no uniform PSO approach. Loss-making port and airport facilities are either cross-\nsubsidized in SOE portfolios or left to line ministries to operate and finance from their budget.7 \nIn the power sector, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) receives a major annual subsidy from \nthe  Government  budget  to  offset  losses  in  all  consumer  categories,  for  which  the  tariff  is  set \nbelow PLN\u2019s cost of supply. The subsidy was Rp12.5 trillion ($1.4 billion) in 2005 and budgeted \nat  Rp28  trillion  ($3.1  billion)  for  2006.  The  very  low  tariffs  for  water  supply  result  in  the  poor \nfinancial  condition  and  high  indebtedness  of  the  regional  water  supply  companies.  The \nGovernment provides annual subsidies of about Rp20 billion ($2.2 million) for bus transport on \n119  subdistrict  routes,  and  about  Rp76  billion  ($8.4  million)  for  ferry  transport  on  64  river  and \ninterisland  routes;  these  represent  the  so-called  pioneer  services.  The  Government  also \nsubsidizes railway operations and pioneer shipping and air transport services. Despite that, low \neconomy-class railway fares impair the financial viability of the Indonesian Railway Corporation. \nIn the telecommunications sector, Government Regulation 28/2005 allows 0.75% of revenues of \nprivate companies to be retained for subsidized rural services. \n \n21. \nTo  achieve  greater  PSP  and  higher  efficiencies  in  PSO  provision,  a  consistent  PSO \nframework  is  needed,  including  an  implementation  policy  and  sector-specific  guidelines.  While \nthe  public  sector  will  continue  to  have  an  important  role  in  delivering  many  noncommercial \nservices,  innovative  approaches  allowing  PSP  could  include  output-based  aid  that  is  explicit, \ntargeted, and driven by the service provider\u2019s performance.  \n \nShallow  Domestic  Financing  Modalities.  Banking  plays  a  dominant  role  within  the \n22. \nfinancial  system,  accounting  for  about  82%  of  overall  assets.  Capital  markets  have  grown  in \nimportance, but long-term debt issuance has until recently been limited to Government bonds. \nThe issuance of corporate bonds has grown gradually to just under $6 billion in 2005, with only \na very small portion originating from SOEs operating in the infrastructure sectors. On the supply \nside,  contractual  savings  institutions  such  as  pension  and  insurance  companies  have \ntraditionally  invested  predominantly  in  Government  bonds  or  bank  deposits.  While  the \nGovernment  estimates  that  domestic  financial  institutions  can  meet  about  20%  of  the \ninfrastructure  funding  requirements,  concerted  reforms  are  needed  to  mobilize  domestic \nresources of this magnitude. Domestic financing would help reduce the currency mismatch and \nthe extent of Government guarantees. The Government needs to facilitate the development of \nlocal  capital  markets  by  enabling  insurance  firms  and  pension  funds  to  finance  infrastructure, \ndeepening  the  bond  market,  strengthening  credit-rating,  establishing  dedicated  infrastructure \nfunds, and allowing regional governments to borrow for infrastructure in local markets. \n \n\nc. \n\nOther Constraints Impeding Infrastructure Development \n\n23.  Weak  Legal,  Regulatory,  and  Implementation  Framework  for  Land  Acquisition. \nLand acquisition problems have impeded several infrastructure projects, particularly toll roads. \nUntil  recently,  land  acquisition  was  governed  by  the  old  Basic  Agrarian  Law  and  Presidential \nRegulation  (Perpres)  55/1993  on  land  acquisition  for  public  infrastructure.  While  providing  a \nlegal  basis,  these  documents  failed  to  balance  the  need  to  protect  social  safeguards  vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe  need  for  expeditious  provision  of  land  or  right-of-way  access  needed  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment. As the cost of land is generally high, an effective mechanism is needed to finance \nland acquisition in a timely manner without leading to uncertainties and excessive speculation. \n\n                                                 \n7   Six SOEs operate 111 ports and 23 airports, leaving the remaining 606 noncommercial ports and 164 airports to be \n\nmanaged by the Ministry of Transportation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nIn many countries, land acquisition for large infrastructure projects is done by the public sector \nas its contribution to the investment costs of PPP projects.  \n \n24. \nLack  of  Clarity  Due  to  Regional  Autonomy.  Decentralization,  while  devolving \nconsiderable authority and autonomy to local governments, has complicated matters related to \ninfrastructure  development.  Responsibility  for  the  provision  of  infrastructure  services  and  the \nrole  of  local  government-owned  enterprises  (BUMDs)  has  not  been  clearly  articulated.  Local \ngovernments, with control over local infrastructure, have not been provided adequate funds and \nmost lack the necessary capacity.  \n \n25. \nSafety,  Security,  and  Asset  Maintenance.  Access  and  connectivity  are  vital  in  the \nIndonesian  archipelago.  Adherence  to  safety  and  security  standards  for  various  modes  of \ntransportation  is  equally  critical.  The  Government  recently  began  adopting  safety  and  security \nthe  road  sector, \nnorms,  and  establishing \nmaintenance  gets  varying  levels  of  attention  across  the  country,  with  national  and  provincial \nroads  reasonably  well  preserved  but  district  and  urban  roads  in  poor  condition  due  to  gross \nunderspending  on  maintenance.  Safety  norms  for  road  use  and  vehicle  overloading  are  only \nslowly  emerging,  and  enforcement  is  weak.  Safety  is  also  an  issue  for  air  and  sea \ntransportation,  due  to  disparities  in  the  adoption  of  safety  norms  across  the  country  and \nineffective enforcement.  \n \n\ninstitutional  mechanisms. \n\nthe  necessary \n\nIn \n\nSummary of Constraints \n\nd. \n \n\n26. \nPoor  Governance  and  Resource  Constraints.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  1997  financial \ncrisis,  four  facets  of  governance  that  impede  infrastructure  development  have  emerged:  (i) \nabsence of sound PSP policies and framework; (ii) opaqueness in bidding, and corruption and \nrent-seeking  during  implementation  affecting  both  public  and  private  sectors;  (iii)  inequality  in \naccess  to  opportunities  by  the  public  and  private  sector;  and  (iv)  weak  cross-sectoral \ncoordination.  The  impact  of  poor  governance  has  been  aggravated  by  the  fiscal  and  other \nresource-related  impediments  affecting  public  and  private  investments  in  infrastructure:  (a) \ndeclining  institutional  capacity  for  sector  planning;  (b)  lack  of  focus  on,  and  inadequate \nresources  allocated  to,  project  preparation;  (c)  lack  of  risk  sharing;  (d)  lack  of  cost  recovery, \nwhich threatens the financial viability of projects; (e) inability of the public sector to finance land \nacquisition; and (f) lack of long-term financial intermediation (Figure 1, page 9).  \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\nThe role of program lending as a vehicle for economic growth and poverty reduction is \n\n27. \nthoroughly examined in several studies leading to the following principal conclusions:8  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPolicy frameworks have often been complex and unrealistic. \nA high degree of formal compliance with conditions does not necessarily lead to \nhigh quality compliance in terms of reform implementation and sustainability, nor \nis it a guarantee of the desired outcome and impact.  \nPolitical  economy  factors  such  as  the  commitment  to,  and  timing  of,  reforms; \nextent of the underlying problems; appreciation by the public of the seriousness \nof these problems; and length of the government term are critical and should be \neffectively factored into the design of programs.  \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2005.

Such \nflexibility  is  particularly  important  when  actions  beyond  government  control  are \nnecessary, such as legislative measures.  \nReforms  should  be  phased  in  and  fully  aligned  with  the  country\u2019s  broader \nmedium-term development agenda. \nDevelopment partners should harmonize and coordinate their policy advice. \n\n \nIn  general,  progress  in policy  reform  has  been  slow  and  gradual  in  Indonesia  after  the \n29. \nfinancial  crisis  due  to  political  economy  considerations,  decentralization,  and  the  complex \nstructure  of  bureaucratic  decision  making.  In  the  infrastructure  sectors,  reforms  have  been \nimpeded  by  overlapping  and  conflicting  responsibilities  across  a  number  of  line  ministries, \nagencies,  and  national  and  local  government  jurisdictions.  Most  of  the  findings  of  the  special \nevaluation  study  are  mirrored  in  an  evaluation  of  the  power  sector  restructuring  program \nsupported by ADB through a policy-based loan of $380 million and a technical assistance loan \nof  $20  million,  with  cofinancing  of  $400  million  from  JBIC.9  The  program  focused  on  sector \nregulation,  unbundling,  financial  viability,  PSP,  and  competition.  The  evaluation  found  that  the \nimplementation  schedule  was  unrealistic  and  the  program  objectives  too  ambitious.  On  the \npositive  side,  the  legal  framework  was  established,  first  steps  toward  unbundling  PLN  were \ntaken, PLN\u2019s financial viability was to a large degree restored, and conditions were created for \ncontinued  PSP  through  postcrisis  contract  renegotiation  with  independent  power  producers. \nHowever,  implementation  took  much  longer  than  originally  planned;  release  of  the  second \ntranche  of  the  program  loan  was  delayed  by  more  than  2  years;  and  the  objectives  of \nintroducing  wholesale  competition  and  divesting  government  majority  stakes  in  the  unbundled \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies were not achieved. The annulment of the \nElectricity Law 20/2002 by the Constitutional Court in December 2004 put further restructuring \non hold. Overall, the program was rated as partly successful. \n \nThe  current  political  economy  factors  generally  bode  well  for  IRSDP  success.  The \n30. \nGovernment has not yet reached the midpoint of its term. It has made accelerated infrastructure \ndevelopment a key pillar of its agenda and expressed the political will to proceed with necessary \nreforms, supported by a credible team of economic ministers. As the IRSDP is fully anchored on \nthe  Government\u2019s  Infrastructure  Policy  Package,  ownership  of  the  relevant  line  ministries  as \nwell as oversight agencies such as the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), and Ministry of Finance (MOF) is strong. The \ngeneral  public  experiences  the  infrastructure  bottlenecks  and  the  poor  quality  of  infrastructure \nservices on a daily basis. Consequently, the majority support the reforms, as demonstrated by \ntheir acceptance of the steep oil price increases in March and October 2005. Nevertheless, the \nreform  agenda  is  broad  and  challenging  as  it  covers  all  infrastructure  sectors,  and  vested \ninterests oppose parts of it. This underlines the need for flexibility in reform implementation. \n \n31. \nBased on these considerations, a program cluster modality is proposed for the IRSDP. \nThe  program  cluster  will  consist  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  anchored  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Infrastructure  Policy  Package.  The  policy  actions  are  allocated  to  three  phases \neach of 21 months: January 2005\u2013September 2006 for subprogram (SP) 1, October 2006\u2013June \n2008 for SP2, and July 2008\u2013March 2010 for SP3. The flexible program structure helps deflect \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2004. Program Completion Report on the Power Sector Restructuring Program in Indonesia.

The  overall \n\n \nTraditionally,  ADB,  JBIC,  and  the  World  Bank  have  been  the  Government\u2019s  principal \n32. \ndevelopment  partners \nIRSDP  design  and \nimplementation of reform measures thus far under SP1 have benefited from close cooperation \nof the three institutions. In addition, the development partners and the Government have taken \ninto  account  the  views  and  concerns  of  the  private  sector.10  Close  coordination  among  the \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Strategic  Investment \nAction  Plan)  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  has  ensured  that  the \ncombined  resources  are  effectively  utilized.  Particularly  noteworthy  is  the  efficient  use  of  TA \nresources  for  capacity  development,  risk  management,  and  preparation  of  PPP  projects.  The \ndevelopment partners, in collaboration with other stakeholders, have also focused on improving \ngovernance  and  anticorruption  in  infrastructure  provision.  At  the  same  time,  the  fact  that  the \nIRSDP  is  founded  on  the  Government\u2019s  own  policy  agenda  helps  reduce  concerns  about \nexternal  pressures  for  reform.  Based  on  the joint  work  as well  as  given  the  overall  benefits  of \nharmonizing  development  support,  the  Government  of  Japan  and  the  World  Bank  are \nconsidering cofinancing  the  IRSDP;  building  on the  earlier  joint  financing  by  ADB  and  JBIC  in \nthe power sector (2001); and the parallel financing from the World Bank, Japan and ADB for the \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (2005).  Appendix  5  contains  the  development  partner \ncoordination matrix, outlining support in areas related to the IRSDP. \n \n\n4. \n\nRationale and Linkage with Other ADB Assistance \n\n33. \nIRSDP  design  and  implementation  have  been  closely  coordinated  with  ongoing  and \nplanned  ADB  programs  and  projects.  ADB  is  adopting  a  dual-track  approach  to  enhance  the \nlinkage  and  synergy  between  cross-cutting  macroeconomic  reforms  and  deeper  sector \nreforms.11  The  measures  supported  under  the  IRSDP  facilitate  ADB  provision  of  significant \ndevelopment  assistance  to  Indonesia  through  both  public  and  private  sector  operations.  Two \nmajor  private  sector  operations  of  ADB  in  the  gas  sector  were  approved  recently,  increasing \nADB\u2019s  direct  support  for  private  sector  development  in  Indonesia.  The  IRSDP  reforms  will \nenhance  sustainability  of  the  recent  and  planned  investments  by  strengthening  the  policy  and \nregulatory  framework,  particularly  in  the  toll-road,  gas,  and  power  sectors.  Lessons  from  the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  public  and  private  sector  projects  will  feed  into  reforms  in \nsubsequent phases of the IRSDP. The new country strategy and program for Indonesia, with its \nfocus  on  improving  the  investment  climate,  envisages  deeper  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment, through a stronger linkage between ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations. In \naddition,  the  IRSDP  will  act  as  a  vehicle  to  help  implement  important  cross-cutting  initiatives \nbeing  pioneered  by  ADB  in  the  region  such  as  the  Clean  Energy  Initiative  and  the  Water \nFinancing Program.  \n\n                                                 \n10 For example, two power sector meetings\u2014in Tokyo in March 2004 and in London in May 2004\u2014were organized \nwith support from ADB, JBIC, and World Bank. The concerns raised by the  private sector related to  government \nguarantees  for  power  sector  investment,  sanctity  of  power  purchase  agreements,  future  structure  of  the  power \nsector, retail electricity tariffs, power sector planning and regulation, and foreign exchange risk mitigation. \n\n11  ADB.2005.

Manila,  (para.  7,  Loan  2228-INO),  outlines \nthis dual-track approach. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nImportant Features \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n34. \nThe  IRSDP  will  improve  the  investment  climate  and  support  timely  realization  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic goals, in particular achieving average annual GDP \ngrowth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 by enhancing infrastructure provision and access. This will \nenable the Government to reduce poverty and boost job creation. The expected outcome of the \nIRSDP is accelerated infrastructure development through large-scale PSP and mobilization, and \nallocation of additional public sector resources.  \n \nB. \n \nThe IRSDP has a number of noteworthy features. First, its overall design is fully in line \n35. \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  growth  vision,  as  articulated  in  the  RPJM, \nand  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure  reform  agenda,  as  formulated  in  the  Infrastructure  Policy \nPackage. Second, designed as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms, the IRSDP \nprovides  the  necessary  flexibility  to  an  emerging  middle-income  country  like  Indonesia  that  is \ngoing  through  democratic  and  political  transition  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  among \nstakeholders with competing interests. It also ensures continuity of reforms resulting in a natural \nprogression from actions to desired outcomes.  \n \n36. \nThird,  the  IRSDP  helps  address  investment  climate  impediments,  a  major  area  of \nconcern in Indonesia. The program supports measures to enhance investments in infrastructure \nprovision,  including  well-defined  sector  policies  and  blueprints  outlining  the  medium  and  long-\nterm priorities; clear legal and regulatory framework that results in equal access and conditions \nand  independent  regulatory  arrangements  over  the  medium  term;  efficient  risk-sharing \nmechanisms to enable greater PSP; strengthened fiduciary management in determining public \nsector investments in PPP projects; and improved governance and transparency in the selection \nof private sector partners to minimize the risks of corruption that has afflicted investments in the \npast  in  Indonesia.  The  IRSDP\u2019s  focus  on  accelerating  infrastructure  provision  will  in  turn \npromote and facilitate other business investments. Several surveys12 show that the inadequate \nprovision  and  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  services,  and  disparities  in  service  coverage  are \nmajor impediments in increasing domestic and foreign investments in Indonesia. Fulfilling PSOs \nis a key cross-cutting area that has an indirect impact in terms of attracting investments in the \nfuture. As the Indonesian economy grows and investments increase, the widespread disparities \nin  development  across  the  country  must  be  addressed.  Reducing  potential  discontent  among \nthe poor and other vulnerable segments of the population is particularly relevant in underserved \nareas with significant natural resource potential, where investments may initially benefit only a \nfew segments of the local population before the benefits can reach the communities at large. \n \nFinally,  in  a  thematic  sense,  the  principal  focus  of  the  IRSDP  is  to  strengthen \n37. \ngovernance  and  alleviate  resource  constraints  in  infrastructure  provision.

These agreements should specify, among other things, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nthe  project  scope,  period  of  partnership/license,  implementation/operation  warranty,  tariff  and \ntariff  adjustment  mechanism,  risks  and  obligations,  performance  standards,  dispute  resolution, \nand supervision method. PPP projects can be identified and prepared either by the Government \nor the private sector, but the sponsors must be selected through open and transparent bidding. \nPerpres 67/2005 describes in detail the rules and procedures for the bidding process, and calls \nfor tariffs to be set at full cost-recovery. If this exceeds the affordability of consumers to pay, the \nGovernment  must  compensate  for  the  difference  with  a  PSO  subsidy.  Perpres  67/2005 \nrecommends that risks be allocated to the party that is best able to manage and control them. \n \nStrengthening  Institutional  and  Coordination  Arrangements  for  PSP.  Perpres \n41. \n42/2005 issued in May 2005 strengthens the ability of the interministerial National Committee for \nthe  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Development  (KKPPI)14  to  fulfill  its  role  in  formulating \ninfrastructure strategies and policies, coordinating and supervising the implementation of these \nstrategies and policies by the line ministries and local governments, formulating PSO policy for \ninfrastructure  services,  and  solving  problems  that  impede  infrastructure  development  by  the \npublic  and  private  sector.  CMEA  Regulation  1/2006  issued  in  May  2006  outlines  the \norganization structure of the KKPPI Secretariat and describes its tasks, which include resolving \ncross-sectoral issues, preparing and updating medium- and long-term infrastructure investment \nplans,  reviewing  and  prioritizing  requests  for  Government  support  for  PPP  projects,  and \nconducting  stakeholder  consultations.  The  secretariat  is  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for \ninfrastructure and regional development in CMEA (in charge of administrative and private sector \ncoordination)  and  the  deputy  minister  for  infrastructure  affairs  in  BAPPENAS  (in  charge  of \ntechnical  support).  The  KKPPI  Secretariat  needs  sustained  capacity  building  and  advisory \nsupport to fulfill its responsibilities.15 \n \nFor  the  day-to-day  coordination  and  management  of  PPP  transactions,  a  network \n42. \nconsisting  of  a  central  PPP  unit  under  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  and  PPP  nodes  in  the  line \nministries  is  being  developed.16  With  the  execution  of  PPP  transactions  devolved  to  the  line \nministries and contracting agencies, the central PPP unit will be responsible for ensuring policy \nconsistency, quality control, and transparency by  establishing standards and principles that all \ntransactions  must  follow,  and  by  monitoring  the  execution  for  compliance.  Given  the  massive \ninvestment  needs  against  limited  capital  resources,  the  unit  will  prioritize  PPP  projects \naccording  to  their  development  impact  and  readiness  for  implementation.  Other  tasks  include \nassisting line ministries and local governments in identifying, preparing, and implementing PPP \nprojects;  reviewing  project  evaluation  carried  out  by  the  PPP  nodes;  evaluating  requests  for \nGovernment support needed for PPP projects; coordinating such support with MOF; publishing \nstatus  reports  on  PPP  projects  and  disseminating  other  relevant  information;  preparing \nguidelines and manuals for PPP projects; and building capacity in the PPP nodes. \n \n43. \nTo  ensure  adequate  information  on  infrastructure  development  among  the  various \nstakeholders, the Consolidated Indonesia Infrastructure Forum was established in 2005, initially \nas  a  unit  under  CMEA  with  financial  support  from  the  World  Bank.  The  forum  is  intended  to \nbecome  an  independent  stand-alone  self-financing  organization.  The  forum  is  to  act  as  an \neffective bridge between the KKPPI and the private sector, to ensure common understanding. \n\n                                                 \n14  The  KKPPI,  which  reports  directly  to  the  President,  is  cochaired  by  the  coordinating  minister  of  economic  affairs \nand the chairperson of BAPPENAS, the latter acting as the executive chair. Its members include the ministers of \nfinance, home affairs, energy and mineral resources, public works, transportation, communications and informatics, \nand state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary.  \n\n15  ADB  is  providing  capacity  building  for  the  BAPPENAS  part  of  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  through  a  TA  grant  (ADB. \n2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Support  for  Infrastructure  Development.  Manila  [TA \n4728-INO for $2 million]). The World Bank has been supporting the CMEA part of the KKPPI Secretariat and the \nline ministries through its $17.3 million Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance loan. \n\n16  The Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance loan has been tapped for designing and establishing \n\nthe central PPP unit and its network. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nGiven  the  importance  of  such  stakeholder  consultations,  the  forum  needs  to  be  fully \noperationalized as soon as possible. \n \n44. \nAdoption  of  a  Risk  Management  Framework.  The  Government  is  developing  a  risk \nmanagement  framework  for  the  infrastructure  sectors  as  an  instrument  for  assessing,  pricing, \nmonitoring,  and  managing  contingent  liabilities  that  arise  from  selective  guarantees  for  PPP \nprojects against risks related to policies and performance of the Government and its agencies. \nIn view of the links to its existing budgeting, fiscal accounting, and debt management systems, \nMOF  has  been  playing  an  important  role  in  developing  and  implementing  the  framework.  In \nOctober 2005, the minister of finance issued Regulation 518/2005 on the establishment of the \nRisk  Management  Committee,  which  specified  its  structure  and  principal  tasks.  Apart  from \nmaking  recommendations  on  the  appropriate  risk  management  policy,  the  committee  was  to \nperform  the  risk  management  function  before  the  creation  of  a  permanent  Risk  Management \nUnit  in  MOF\u2019s  new  Fiscal  Policy  Office.  The  risk  management  function  involves  examining \nrequests  for  Government  support  for  PPP  projects  submitted  by  the  contracting  authorities, \nscreened  by  the  PPP  nodes  in  the  line  ministries,  reviewed  and  prioritized  by  the  KKPPI \nSecretariat  with  the  help  of  the  central  PPP  unit,  and  endorsed  by  the  KKPPI;  setting  the \nparameters  and  targets  for  PPP  agreements;  and  monitoring  performance  of  PPP  projects \nduring  their  operation.  Support  for  the  Risk  Management  Unit  will  be  provided  through  the  TA \nattached to the IRSDP (para. 94).  \n \nIn May 2006 the minister of finance issued Regulation 38/2006 on the risk management \n45. \npolicy  to  ensure  that  risks  of  individual  PPP  projects  are  appropriately  allocated  between  the \npublic  and  private  sectors,  and  that  the  Government\u2019s  overall  exposure  is  well  managed.  The \ndual  objective  of  the  policy  is  to  support  infrastructure  development  while  maintaining  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government  budget.  The  new  regulation  describes  the  types  of  risks  the \nGovernment  may  consider  sharing  (those  related  to  political  events,  project  performance,  and \ndemand),  the  main  principles  for  providing  such  support  (legality,  project  quality  in  terms  of \ntechnical and financial feasibility, fiscal prudence in terms of total exposure and annual budget, \nand transparency), and approval procedures. The MOF regulation was complemented in June \n2006  by  CMEA  Regulation  4/2006  on  the  evaluation  procedure  for  projects  requiring \nGovernment  support.  While  reiterating  the  project  quality,  fiscal  prudence,  and  transparency \nprinciples,  this  regulation  outlines  the  roles  of  the  KKPPI,  its  secretariat,  and  the  central  PPP \nunit in the evaluation; and specifies in detail the documentation needed and criteria to be met, \nsuch  as  the  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact  analysis,  socioeconomic  benefit-cost \nanalysis,  risk  analysis,  bidding  documents  (including  draft  concession  agreement),  and  the \nproject\u2019s compatibility with the RPJM, sector strategic plan, and regional spatial plan. As to the \ntransparency principle, the regulation stipulates that requests for Government support must be \nsubmitted before bidding.  \n \nSupporting  Land  Acquisition.  Intensive  stakeholder  review  and  feedback,  including \n46. \ncomments  from  international  investors  at  the  February  2006  Infrastructure  Forum,  resulted  in \nthe adoption of Perpres 65/2006 in June 2006 to amend Perpres 36/2005.17 Together, the two \nregulations have the potential to move the Government\u2019s policies on land acquisition closer to \ninternationally  accepted  principles  on  involuntary  resettlement,  particularly  with  regard  to \nprovisions on the use of market prices and recognition of nonphysical losses. The National Land \nAgency  has  drafted  implementing  regulations,  which  provide  for  both  aspects.  For  projects \nserving public interest, expropriation is allowed after 120 days if no agreement is reached with \nlandowners. The period for negotiations excludes the time required for identification, valuation, \n                                                 \n17  Replacing Perpres 55/1993 on land acquisition for public infrastructure and providing for independent valuation of \nproperty  to  reduce  opportunity  for  speculation;  expanding  the  definition  of  public  interest  to  areas  such  as  piped \nwater, power transmission lines, and sanitary landfills; and clarifying the period of negotiations before any recourse \nby expropriation can be sought. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nand notification of the asset owner. While gaps still exist in terms of ADB policy requirements on \nlivelihood restoration, consultation, grievance redress, and rights of squatters, the Government \nis considering how to address these through the implementing regulations. In addition, some of \nthese  gaps  may  be  addressed  in  planned  amendments  to  the  Basic  Agrarian  Law.  As \ndemonstrated by the unsuccessful bidding for several toll-road projects, investors are unwilling \nto bear the land acquisition risk. Therefore land acquisition must be completed prior to bidding. \nMOF  is  finalizing  its  plans  on  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  for  financing  land \nacquisition  from  the  budget,  with  reimbursement  from  investors  once  their  projects  are \ncompleted and yield revenue.  \n \n47. \nDiversifying  and  Strengthening  Financing  Modalities  and  Mechanisms.  MOF  has \nprepared  a  policy  paper  outlining  measures  needed  to  mobilize  resources  through  various \nmodalities and mechanisms to provide financing for PPP projects. The paper covers the entire \nspectrum  of  financing  needs,  from  project  preparation  to  implementation,  for  both  public  and \nprivate  investments  and  guarantees:  (i)  PDF  for  preparing  national  and  decentralized \ninfrastructure  projects;  (ii)  a  PPP  infrastructure  financing  fund  to  help  meet  the  public  sector \nportion  of  PPP  transactions,  including  land  acquisition  and  other  upfront  investments;  (iii)  a \nguarantee fund to provide backing for government support; and (iv) an Indonesia infrastructure \nfund to offer project financing to the private sector. Given the weaknesses in project preparation \nthat have impeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of the PDF merits top priority.  \n \nto \n48. \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  local  government  borrowing  (including  onlending  and  on-\ngranting of foreign loans by the central Government to local governments), and workout of local \ngovernment debt arrears are being addressed by strengthening the relevant legal framework.18 \nThese  efforts  have  been  supported  by  two  policy-based  operations  of  ADB19  and  the  World \nBank,20 approved in late 2005. As part of the IRSDP, the Government has drafted a regulation \nclarifying  national  and  local  government  responsibilities  in  infrastructure  provision,  operation, \ncontracting, and regulation. The Government has also drafted a law on BUMDs. Under the new \nlegal  framework  on  decentralization,21  local  governments  may  issue  bonds  in  local  currency. \nHowever, the financial soundness of local governments needs to be thoroughly assessed, and \nan appropriate legal framework adopted that clearly outlines the criteria for central Government \napproval and recourse, besides credit-rating and other oversight requirements.22 \n \n\nIntergovernmental  Coordination \n\nIssues:  The \n\nAddressing \n\nrelated \n\nissues \n\nb. \n\nSector Policy, Legal, and Institutional Reforms \n\n49. \nRoads.  The  new  Road  Law  38/2004  and  the  subsequent  Government  Regulation \n15/2005  on  Toll  Roads  reformed  the  legal  framework  and  are  facilitating  greater  PSP.23  They \nhave  unbundled  the  sector  by  separating  the  regulatory  functions  from  the  main  SOE,  Jasa \nMarga; calling for the establishment of a new regulatory body; ending Jasa Marga\u2019s monopoly \non toll-road development; and allowing private investors to bid for new build-operate-transfer or \nconcession  projects  in  competition  with  Jasa  Marga.  In  August  2005,  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks (MPW) issued Decree 374/2005, which enables the toll-road tariffs to be set on the basis \n\n                                                 \n18  Enactment  of  the  Law  on  Regional  Fiscal  Balance  33/2004,  and  ongoing  revisions  to  Government  Regulation \n\n107/2000 and Ministerial Decree 35/2003.  \n\n19  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development Program. \nManila (Loan 2192\u2013INO for $300 million). \n\n20  Second  Development  Policy  Loan,  approved  by  the  World  Bank  on  15  December  2005  for  $400  million,  and \n\ncofinanced by ADB\u2019s Development Policy Support Program loan (footnote 8). \n\n21  Law 32/2004 on Regional Autonomy and Law 33/2004 on Regional Fiscal Balance. \n22  ADB  is  providing  TA  to  undertake  a  preliminary  assessment  of  selected  local  governments,  and  to  draft  the \n\nrelevant legal framework. \n\n23  To date, the private sector has been involved in the development of only 24% of the 600-km toll road network. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ntariffs \n\nimplementation  of \n\nissuing  a  series  of \n\nfor  such  projects;  and  supervising \n\nof  a  bidding  process.  At  the  same  time,  tariffs  for  existing  toll  roads  were  increased  by  15%\u2013\n50% to ensure financial sustainability of their operation. To complete the legal framework, MPW \nhas  been \nimplementing  regulations.  Road  Law  38/2004  will  be \ncomplemented  by  the  new  Law  on  Road  Traffic  and  Transportation,  drafted  by  the  Ministry  of \nTransportation  (MOT)  and  submitted  to  Parliament,  providing  many  opportunities  for  PSP  in \ntransport  services,  transport  infrastructure  such  as  bus  terminals  and  parking,  and  support \nservices such as vehicle inspection. \n \n50. \nAs  stipulated  by  the  new  legal  framework,  the  Indonesian  Toll  Road  Authority  was \nestablished  in  October  2005.  Its  responsibilities  include  developing  business  plans  and \nfeasibility  studies  for  toll-road  projects;  conducting  bidding,  facilitating  land  acquisition,  and \nrecommending \ntoll-road \nconcessions.  The  authority,  which  reports  to  the  minister  of  public  works,  comprises  a \nchairperson and four members from the Government, road association, universities, and other \nstakeholders. To ensure complementarity of toll roads with other parts of the road network, the \ntoll-road  authority  works  closely  with  MPW\u2019s  Directorate  General  of  Highways.  The  short-term \nchallenge  is  to  fully  operationalize  the  authority.  In  the  medium  term,  a  separation  of  its \ncontracting and regulatory functions, and making the latter fully independent of MPW, should be \nconsidered.24 \n \n51. \nInstitutional  capacity  in  the  road  sector  is  still  weak  in  some  aspects.  While  national \nasset management capacity is being strengthened, capacity building for development planning \nand operation and maintenance is needed. Regional agencies vary considerably in capacity and \nperformance,  and  interagency  coordination  is  weak.  Heavy  vehicle  overloading  is  prevalent, \nroad preservation costs are increasing significantly, and road safety is poor. The implementation \nof  road  works  is  often  expensive  and  of  low  quality,  and  collusion  among  contractors  is  a \nproblem.  The  business  practices  and  performance  of  national  agencies  and  the  construction \nindustry  need  to  be  improved  and  capacity  of  the  regional  agencies  built  up.  Regulatory \nenforcement  to  reduce  vehicle  overloading  needs  strengthening  and  a  comprehensive  road \nsafety  program  implemented.  MPW,  together  with  MOT  and  with  assistance  from  the  World \nBank, is preparing two initiatives in these areas: a pilot road safety program in Semarang and \npilot  testing  of  performance-based  contracts  for  road  maintenance,  including  vehicle  load \ncontrol, in central Java. To increase transparency and reduce opportunities for corruption, MPW \nhas  adopted  standard  bidding  documents  and  is  developing  an  e-procurement  system  for  all \nroad contracts. Moving forward, a comprehensive action program of anticorruption measures in \nthe areas of procurement, transparency and accountability, auditing, and human resources will \nbe formulated and implemented under SP2 and SP3. \n \n52. \nTo  put  the  financing  of  road  maintenance  on  a  self-sustained  basis,  restructuring  of \nvehicle-related taxes needs to be considered. The restructuring should lead to a system of road-\nuser charges that ensures full recovery of the necessary road preservation costs, and reflects \nactual road usage and the contribution of various vehicle categories to these costs. In particular, \ncharges for heavy vehicles should be related to their load capacity and road-damaging effects. \nIn the medium term, the establishment of a transparent accounting mechanism such as a road \nfund should be considered. Measures are also necessary in the medium term that separate the \noperator and regulatory functions, and make the latter independent of MPW, which sets overall \nsector policy. \n\n                                                 \n24  Such  independence  can  be  achieved  by  giving  the  regulatory  body  statutory  authority  and  ensuring  that  it  has \nadequate technical expertise, reports to the President of Indonesia, has no financial stake in any sector operator, is \nfinancially  autonomous  through  funding  from  levies  on  the  regulated  industry,  is  headed  by  commissioners \nappointed  for  fixed  terms  and  on  the  basis  of  transparent  selection  criteria,  and  has  appropriate  stakeholder \nrepresentation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n53. \nPorts and Airports. The legal and regulatory framework needs to be revised to end the \nmonopolies of the four SOEs in the port sector and two SOEs in the airport sector, as well as \ntheir  multiple  roles  of  landlord,  regulator,  contracting  authority  for  the  provision  of  port/airport \nservices,  and  operator.  In  addition,  the  creation  of  a  separate  provider  of  air  traffic  services \nshould  be  considered.  Significant  progress  has  already  been  made  in  revising  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework. Presidential Decree 5/2005 on Empowering Domestic Shipping Industry \npromotes  the  separation  of  regulatory  and  operational  functions  in  ports,  and  encourages \ncompetition among operators within and between ports. MOT has completed the drafting of new \nlaws  for  sea  transport  and  aviation,  and  submitted  them  to  Parliament.  It  is  important  that  the \nnew  laws,  including  the  subsequent  implementing  regulations,  provide  for  such  sector \nrestructuring. In particular, the legal framework should allow the establishment of true landlord \nport  and  airport  structures  where  landlords  have  no  direct  financial  stake  in  any  service \nproviders, and should clarify the roles and responsibilities of local governments. \n  \n54. \nThe  creation  of  landlord  structures  where  operating  concessions  can  be  competitively \ntendered with no conflict of interest from the landlord will require restructuring the six SOEs to \nfocus on either the landlord or operating role. As each of these SOEs manages a group of loss- \nand  profit-making  ports/airports,  such  restructuring  will  also  help  in  efficiently  managing  the \nPSOs.  In  the  airport  sector,  separating  air  traffic  services  will  significantly  reduce  SOE \nrevenues. Tariff adjustments to reflect cost recovery will help offset this reduction. Regulation of \ntariffs, safety and service standards, and licensing can continue to be the responsibility of MOT, \nbut in the medium term, the creation of independent regulatory bodies should be pursued, with \nMOT in charge of policy making, planning, and coordination. \n \n55. \nRailways.  MOT  has  completed  the  drafting  of  a  new  railway  law  and  submitted  it  to \nParliament. If enacted in its current form, the new law will end the monopoly of the Indonesian \nRailway Corporation in operating rolling stock and maintaining infrastructure, and allow private \nservice  provision  without  forming  a  joint  venture  with  the  railway  corporation.  To  succeed  in \ncompetition  for  the  market  with  private  sector  service  providers,  the  corporation  will  have  to \nimprove  its  management  and  operation.  In  the  medium  term,  ensuring  equal  conditions  for  all \nservice providers by establishing an independent regulatory body is important. Transparent tariff \nsetting and PSO arrangements will also go a long way in encouraging PSP.25 \n \nPower. To remove the legal uncertainty caused by the ruling of the Constitutional Court \n56. \nin  December  2004,  which  automatically  led  to  reenactment  of  the  previous  Electricity  Law \n15/1985, Government Regulation 3/2005 on Electricity Procurement and Utilization was issued \nin  January  2005,  followed  by  two  ministerial  decrees.  While  giving  the  principal  authority  for \npower  supply  to  PLN,  the  regulation  and  decrees  allow  purchase  of  electricity  by  PLN  from \nindependent power producers. This is an interim solution until a new law is in place, for which \npublic  consultations  are  being  held  by  Parliament.  The  new  law,  while  respecting  the \nConstitution,  should  retain  the  spirit  of  the  annulled  law,  and  be  quickly  followed  by \nimplementing  regulations.  Given  the  controversy  and  uncertainty  caused  by  the  ruling  of  the \nConstitutional Court, stakeholder consultations are essential for reaching a consensus on how \nto reduce PLN\u2019s monopoly and increase competition in the longer term, while retaining control of \nthe  sector  through  stronger  planning  and  regulation.  Nevertheless,  as  PLN  will  continue  to \ndominate the sector in the foreseeable future, its institutional capacity in areas such as project \nplanning  and  implementation,  financial  management,  and  corporate  governance  should  be \nstrengthened. The planned PLN corporate restructuring study will support this effort.  \n \n                                                 \n25  At  present,  the  passenger  fares  for  economy  class  travel  are  set  by  MOT  based  on  the  ability  to  pay,  with  the \ndifference to the actual cost to be reimbursed to the Indonesian Railway Corporation, which implements this PSO \npolicy,  while  other  passenger  fares  and  all  freight  fares  can  be  set  by  the  corporation  subject  to  MOT\u2019s \nendorsement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n57. \nRestoring  PLN\u2019s  financial  viability  is  crucial  for  enhancing  its  creditworthiness.  If \nindependent power producers and their financiers have doubts about PLN\u2019s ability to pay their \nbills,  the  demand  for  Government  guarantees  against  this  off-take  risk  will  rise  and  the \nadditional installed capacity requirements may not be met. Originally, the Government planned \nto increase the average electricity tariff by at least 15% in early 2006. However, because of the \nnegative impact of the previous fuel subsidy reductions and interest rate increases on inflation \nand  economic  growth,  and  the  Government\u2019s  concern  about  the  likelihood  of  major  public \nprotests, the tariff increase has been deferred. The Government recognizes that cost recovery \nmust  be  achieved  once  the  political  and  macroeconomic  conditions  allow.  Its  medium-term \nstrategy is to combine tariff increases with cost-saving measures, such as the coal-fired power \nplant  program  to  displace  oil-based  generation,  as  well  as  with  improvements  in  PLN\u2019s \nefficiency, such as a reduction in the transmission and distribution losses from 11.5% in 2005 to \nbelow  10%.  Once  full  cost  recovery  is  achieved,  the  tariff  issue  should  be  depoliticized26  by \ndeveloping  a  rational  tariff-setting  mechanism  that  maintains  the  recovery,  and  delegating \nresponsibility  for  its  application  to  an  independent  regulatory  body.  In  the  interim,  the \nGovernment  is  willing  to  provide  assurances  for  new  independent  power  producer  projects \nindicating  that  the  Government  will  ensure  that  PLN  can  meet  its  PSOs.  This  would  be  a \ndeparture from the earlier open-ended practice of the Government commitment to ensure PLN \nmeets its power purchase agreement obligations. The IRSDP will support the development and \nimplementation of a fiscally sound system in this area. \n \n58.  When  increasing  electricity  tariffs,  the  impact  on  the  poor  must  be  cushioned.  The \ncurrent lifeline rate system27 may be too generous in its coverage as more than half of PLN\u2019s 33 \nmillion  customers  accounting  for  almost  30%  of  PLN\u2019s  electricity  sales  benefit.  The  system, \nincluding  connection  fees,  should  be  reviewed  to  determine  whether  better  targeting  and \nprotection of the poor are necessary by narrowing customer groups benefiting and, at the same \ntime, reducing the lifeline rate. \n \n59. \nOil  and  Gas.  The  Government  has  given  high  priority  to  gradual  removal  of  fuel \nsubsidies, as they have posed a heavy burden on the budget,28 disproportionately benefited the \nmiddle  class  and  the  rich,29  and  distorted  the  energy  mix.  Given  the  political  sensitivity  of  this \nissue,  the  Government  conducted  a  comprehensive  socialization  campaign  and  explained  the \nrationale for, and unavoidability of, the gradual subsidy removal before increasing the domestic \nprices of oil products in February/March 2005 by an average of 49%.30 Despite the major price \nincreases,  the  subsequent  unfavorable  movement  of  world  market  prices  widened  the  gap \nagain. MOF projections showed that the fuel subsidy would rise from the $8.2 billion allocated in \nthe revised 2005 budget (18% of the total government expenditure), to almost $15 billion (33%), \ncrowding out expenditures for social sectors and infrastructure. As this development was clearly \nunsustainable  and  negatively  affected  the  rupiah,  the  Government  took  two  bold  actions.  In \nJuly\u2013August  2005,  prices  for  industrial  users,  accounting  for  37%  of  total  consumption,  were \nbrought to international levels, and in October 2005 after intensive socialization efforts, prices of \nthe remaining oil products were raised by an average of 126%.31 To mitigate the social impact \n\n                                                 \n26  Government  Regulation  3/2005  upholds  the  principle  that  electricity  tariffs  are  set  by  the  President  of  Indonesia \n\nbased on a recommendation of the minister of energy and mineral resources. \n\n27  The lifeline rate of about $0.018/kWh is applicable to small residential consumers with a capacity of less than 450 \nvolts-ampere,  social  institutions,  small  businesses,  and  small  industries,  for  the  first  30  kWh  of  their  monthly \nconsumption. \n\n28  In the 2004 budget, i.e., before the sharp rise of international oil prices, fuel subsidies were almost equivalent to the \n\nallocation for education and health, and more than twice as high as the allocation for roads and irrigation. \n\n29  Only about 6% of Indonesian households have cars, and only a third have motorcycles. \n30  By 27% for automotive diesel oil, 33% for gasoline, 39% for industrial diesel oil, 44% for kerosene used by industry, \nand 104% for marine fuel oil. For social reasons, the price of kerosene used by households was kept unchanged. \n31  By 105% for automotive diesel oil, 88% for gasoline, and 186% for kerosene, bringing the prices of these products \n\nto 77%, 80%, and 33% of the then prevailing international levels. \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nof  these  unprecedented  measures,32  the  Government  announced  a  major  package  of  direct \nsubsidies  to  the  poor.33  The  Government  also  made  clear  its  intention  to  complete  the  fuel \nsubsidy removal during 2006\u20132007 and let domestic oil prices follow international prices. \n \n60. \nGiven its large reserves, natural gas can play a much more important role domestically. \nThe  recently  issued  Perpres  5/2006  on  National  Energy  Policy  stipulates  a  minimum  share  of \n30% for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix  by 2025, compared to less than 20% for oil. In \nresponse  to  the  Constitutional  Court\u2019s  ruling  on  oil  and  gas  pricing,  and  the  minimum  gas \nallocation  for  the  domestic  market,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  drafted  the \nnecessary  amendments  to  the  implementing  regulations  for  Oil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001,  setting \nthe domestic market obligation for gas producers at 25%. Another impetus to the domestic use \nof gas will come from the new Energy Law, which aims to increase access to energy and ensure \nenergy security through diversification, conservation, and public participation. Investments in the \ncountry\u2019s large reserves of coal-bed methane have been limited due to lack of policy and legal \nclarity on extraction and sale or the resource. A policy and operational guidelines for coal-bed \nmethane exploration and production are needed. \n \nThe current dual role of regulator and contracting authority played by BPH Migas in the \n61. \ndownstream  part  of  the  sector  may  raise  concerns  among  operators  about  its  objectivity  in \nresolving  contractual  disputes.  The  division  of  contracting  authority  for  the  upstream  and \ndownstream  business  between  BP  Migas  and  BPH  Migas  may  lead  to  inconsistencies  in  the \nplanning  and  implementation  of  upstream  and  downstream  projects.  Consequently,  current \narrangements  should  be  reviewed  in  the  medium  term,  with  a  view  to  creating  a  single \nregulatory  body  and  a  single  contracting  agency,  and  ensuring  that the  former  has  no  links  to \nthe  latter  and  is  fully  independent.  Apart  from  managing  tariffs  prescribed  by  contract  or \ndetermined  by  the  market,  the  new  regulatory  body  should  take  over  some  other  regulatory \nfunctions currently exercised by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, such as issuing \nlicenses and setting service standards. \n \nTelecommunications. This infrastructure sector is more advanced in terms of reforms \n62. \nthan other sectors. The two major enterprises with state ownership\u2014Telkom and Indosat\u2014are \nlisted  at  the  Jakarta  and  New  York  stock  exchanges,  the  Indonesian  Telecommunications \nRegulatory  Body34 \nthe  Ministry  of \nCommunications  and  Informatics  issued  Regulation  8/2006  on  interconnection  providing  for  a \nmove  from  revenue  sharing  to  a  cost-based  approach  for  tariff  setting.  Looking  forward,  the \nsector  blueprint  needs  to  be  updated  taking  into  account  achievements  in  PSP,  lessons,  and \ntechnological  advances.  To  move  from  the  current  duopoly  to  full  competition  and  thereby \nencourage higher investments by the private sector, business opportunities need to be opened \nfor fixed-line long-distance and international connections. This will require the design of a new \nindustry  structure  and  restructuring  of  the  current  licensing  system.  Finally,  a  PSO  policy  is \nneeded to help accelerate the expansion of fixed-line services, particularly in rural areas.35 \n \n63.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  IRSDP  supports  the  formulation  of  policies  on \ncommunity  and  institution-based  provision  of  water  supply  and  environmental  sanitation \n\nis  operational  and  after  stakeholder  consultations, \n\n                                                 \n32  A 12% oil price increase in 2000 was followed by a 30% increase in 2001 and a 22% increase in 2003. The 2003 \n\nincrease was partly rolled back by the previous administration because of public discontent. \n\n33  The package consists of quarterly payments of Rp300,000 to an estimated 15.6 million households with a monthly \n\nper capita income of less than Rp175,000. \n\n34  Chaired  by  the  director  general  of  post  and  telecommunications,  of  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformatics, the regulatory body has six other members, and is funded from the ministry\u2019s budget. Apart from being \ninvolved in this regulatory function, the Directorate General of Post and Telecommunications is in charge of policy \nmaking and business license issuance. \n\n35  The recent Government Regulation 28/2005 allows retaining 0.75% of revenues of telecommunication companies \n\nfor this purpose. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nservices to more effectively address access and quality issues in service delivery.36 The Water \nResources Law 7/2004 and the subsequent Government Regulation 16/2005 on Water Supply \nhave  established  a  major  part  of  the  necessary  legal  framework  by  clarifying  the  terms  for \nPSP,37  ending  BUMD  monopolies,  eliminating  the  need  for  local  parliament  approval  of  water \ntariff  increases,  and  calling  for  the  establishment  of  the  National  Water  Regulatory  Agency \nunder  MPW.38  Despite  its  name,  the  agency  is  basically  an  advisory  rather  than  regulatory \nbody.  Its  main  responsibilities  include  helping  formulate  sector  policy  and  strategy,  setting \noperational  standards  for  water  supply,  setting  and  evaluating  service  standards  and \nperformance  of  the  regional  water supply  companies  (PDAMs),  and  making  recommendations \non involving cooperatives and the private sector in water supply. As water supply falls under the \nauthority of the fully decentralized district governments, the Government\u2019s vision is to strengthen \nthe role of the National Water Regulatory Agency. The institutional arrangements for regulation \nwill be reviewed and strengthened under SP2 and SP3, parallel to the issuance of the remaining \nimplementing  regulations  related  to  national  water  resources  policy,  national  water  resources \nboard,  water  resources  management,  water  resources  business,  rivers  and  lakes,  swamps, \ndams and reservoirs, groundwater, water quality management, and irrigation. \n \nTo ensure operational efficiency and financial viability of PDAMs, their commercialization \n64. \nand  corporatization  need  to  be  pursued  through  enhanced  management  autonomy,  technical \ncapacity  building,  cost-recovery \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  accounting,  unaccounted-for-water  reduction,  stronger  customer  orientation, \nmergers of small nonviable PDAMs, and service coverage expansion. A system of transparent \nPSO  subsidies  targeting  the  poor  in  urban  and  rural  areas  is  needed  as  part  of  expanding \nservice coverage. Given the high indebtedness of most PDAMs, financial restructuring through \nthe  conversion  of  their  long-term  debt  into  government  equity  and  offsetting  receivables  from \nlocal  governments  with  repayments  due  to  MOF  is  essential.  The  Government  is  preparing \nseveral  restructuring  programs  comprising  over  40  PDAMs.39  Under  SP1,  detailed  appraisals \nhave been completed for five PDAMs, which will receive implementation support during SP2. If \nthe pilot program proves successful, the Government is committed to country-wide expansion.  \n \n\nrevenue  collection,  better \n\nimproved \n\ntariffs, \n\nc. \n\nModel Public-Private Partnership Projects \n\n65. \nAt the IIS in January 2005, the Government offered 91 projects totaling $22.5 billion to \nthe private sector,40 but the expectations raised by this major offering have not yet been met. So \nfar prequalification and bidding have been undertaken for two batches of toll roads comprising a \ntotal  of  17  projects,  three  gas  pipeline  projects,  and  one  power  project;  prequalification  is \nongoing  for  another  six  power  projects.  Participation  in  the  bidding  has  been  generally  low. \n\n                                                 \n36  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  been  guided  by  the  framework  developed  in  ADB.  2003.  Asian \n\nWater Supplies. Manila. \n\n37  PSP can take the form of a cooperation agreement with the concerned regional water supply company or a license \n\ngranted by the concerned local government. \n\n38  Under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Regulatory Framework for Private and \nPublic  Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Enterprises.  Manila  (TA  3761-INO),  various  regulatory  framework  options \nwere  discussed  extensively  with  central,  local,  and  private  stakeholders.  In  view  of  the  decentralized  structure,  a \nconsensus  emerged  to  set  up  a  two-tier  structure  combining  a  national  regulatory  body  and  local  regulatory \nfunctions, to be carried out by local regulators, thus recognizing both the primary role of local governments in the \nregulation of water services and the need for an overarching national regulatory framework to promote a consistent \napproach to transparent regulation throughout the country. \n\n39  The  World  Bank  has  supported  the  Government  in  assessing  13  PDAMs  under  the  proposed  Urban  Water  and \nSanitation  Improvement  and  Expansion  Project,  and  an  additional  20  PDAMs  through  ongoing  TA.  ADB  has \nevaluated  15  PDAMs  in  preparing  for  the  proposed  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Program.  Given  the  complex \ndebt-restructuring arrangements, negotiations with local governments have proceeded slowly. \n\n40  This offering consisted of 38 toll-road projects ($9.4 billion), 12 power projects ($5.9 billion), 6 gas projects ($2.9 \nbillion), 1 telecommunications project ($1.6 billion), 4 port projects ($ 1.5 billion), 5 airport projects ($ 0.7 billion), 24 \nwater supply projects ($0.4 billion), and 1 railway project ($0.1 billion). \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\nContracts  have  been  awarded  for  the  three  gas  pipelines and  one  power  plant,  as  well  as  for \nthree toll roads, however the selected bidders have not arranged financing yet. Three primary \nreasons  may  explain  the  lack  of  bidders  and  inability  to  achieve  more  contract  awards  and \nfinancial closings.  First,  project  preparation  including  (i)  a  thorough  feasibility  study  with  a  risk \nanalysis,  (ii)  project  packaging  that  is  appropriate  for  execution  on  a  PPP  basis,  and  (iii)  a \nbankable draft concession agreement, has been poor. Second, the Government did not indicate \nany support in the bidding documents, despite major risks perceived by investors with regard to \nland  acquisition  for  toll-road  projects  and  PLN\u2019s  creditworthiness  for  power  projects.  Finally, \nbidding was hampered by the lack of strong central coordination. \n \n66.  With  the  recent  establishment  of  the  PSP  and  risk  management  frameworks  that \naddress these problems (Perpres 67/2005 and MOF Regulation 38/2006), the execution of PPP \nprojects  is  expected  to  accelerate.  Demonstrating,  through  successful  bidding  and  financial \nclosing  for  well-prepared  model  PPP  projects,  that  the  investment  climate  in  Indonesia  has \nsufficiently improved to execute such major transactions in line with international best practice is \nimportant. In particular, the execution of such transactions must not unduly favor SOEs or other \nconnected entities. As part of SP1, the Government has identified ten candidates for model PPP \nprojects  with  combined  estimated  investment  requirements  of  about  $4.5  billion  (Table  3). \nThese  projects  will  go  through  all  the  necessary  preparatory  steps  and  transparent  bidding \nprocesses stipulated in the PSP and risk management frameworks.  \n \nUnder  SP2  and  SP3,  the  process  of  project  identification,  screening,  preparation,  and \n67. \nbidding  will  be  continuous.  The  bidding  process  is  expected  to  be  completed  for  the  already \nselected model PPP projects, with the concession agreements signed and construction started. \nIn addition, the Government is expected to proceed with a significant number of additional PPP \nprojects. \n \n\nTable 3: Candidate Model Public-Private Partnership Projects \n\nProject \n\nKey Features \n\n2X600 MW \n1X500 MW \n60 km \n\n Investment \n($ million) \n1,200\n275\n142\n\n165 km \n1.2 million passengers \n350m berth container terminal \nBulk water distribution; and \nwater pipeline \n30,000 km of fiber optic network \n\n \n\n928\n97\n275\n107\n\n1,500\n\n4,524\n\nCentral Java Coal-Fired Power Plant  \nPasuruan Combined Cycle Plant \nMedan\u2013Kuala Namu\u2013Tebing Tinggi Toll-\nRoad Project  \nSolo\u2013Kertosono Toll-Road Project  \nMargagiri\u2013Ketapang Ferry Terminal \nTeluk Lamong Seaport \nThree Bulk Water Supply Projects \n(Bandung, Dumai and Tanggerang)   \nNational Telecommunications Backbone \nProject \nTotal \n\nkm = kilometer; MW = Megawatt. \nSource: KKPPI. \n \n68. \nactions taken under the IRSDP.  \n \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\nSummary  of  Policy  Actions.  Appendix  4  presents  a  simplified  summary  of  the  key \n\n69. \nThe  IRSDP  adopts  a  program  cluster  approach  with  three  back-to-back  subprograms, \neach covering about 21 months and supported by a single-tranche program loan. Thus, subject \nto  approval  of  SP1  by  the  Board  in  October  2006,  SP2  could  be  brought  for  the  Board\u2019s \nconsideration  in  June  2008,  and  SP3  in  March  2010.  Based  on  the  reform  agenda  that  has \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nevolved thus far, SP1 and SP2 have heavier reform content. The final agenda for SP3 will be \nfully  developed  during  2007\u20132009,  by  rebalancing  outputs  between  SP2  and  SP3  and  taking \ninto account the emerging circumstances. In addition, investment loans or other support may be \nadded  under  the  IRSDP  to  meet  emerging  needs.  The  PDF  that  is  processed  with  SP1  is  an \nexample. The Government strongly supports the program cluster approach, as it provides much \ngreater flexibility and facilitates medium-term planning. Since the approval of each subprogram \nis effectively embedded into the loan review process of the outcomes under the previous phase, \nthe  processing  and  financial  implications  do  not  differ  greatly  between  a  program  cluster \napproach  and  the  traditional  multitranche  program  loan  modality.  However,  the  inherent \nflexibility  of  the  former  will  reduce  the  transaction  costs  both  for  the  Borrower  and  ADB  by \navoiding  rigid  policy  conditions  built  into  multitranche  programs  that  frequently  lead  to  delays \nbecause of political economy factors that are beyond the Government\u2019s control. \n  \nFor  SP1,  the  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \n70. \ncapital resources to support the reforms outlined in the policy matrix and the development policy \nletter (Appendix 3). The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may \nbe  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion  guidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program \nloan agreement. The Government has given ADB (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance or any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n71. \nThe  loan  size  was  determined  by  the  strength  of  the  policy  package,  its  development \nimpact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  and  the  adjustment  costs  arising  due  to  the \nestablishment of various regulatory bodies and coordination mechanisms. The Government has \nset aside a total of Rp.5 trillion ($520 million) for risk sharing, equity contribution to a planned \ninfrastructure  fund,  and  a  revolving  fund  for  land  acquisition.  In  addition,  the  public  sector \nportion of the planned PPP projects is estimated at about $2 billion in the short term. Thus, the \ndirect  needs  related  to  measures  under  SP1  alone  are  about  $2.5  billion.  Viewed  over  the \nprogram cluster period, there are major adjustment costs imposed by restructuring of SOEs to \nallow  for  greater  access  and  opportunities  for  the  private  sector,  and  the  significant  PSOs  for \npro-poor infrastructure. Essential initial steps are being taken and investments made now.  \n \n72. \nSubject  to  approvals  by  their  respective  authorities,  the  Government  of  Japan  and  the \nWorld Bank may cofinance SP1 on the basis of the IRSDP policy matrix and the thrust of the \ndevelopment policy letter. In terms of its overall financing requirements in 2006, the Government \nhas  sought $1.3  billion-$1.5  billion  in  program  loans  from  ADB,  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank.41 \nThis reflects a significantly higher fiscal deficit in 2006 (around 1.0% of GDP), due to increased \ndevelopment  spending  in  the  health,  education,  and  infrastructure  sectors,  as  well  as  the \nYogyakarta-Central  Java  reconstruction  assistance.  These  needs  can  be  accommodated  only \npartly through the fuel subsidy reductions in 2005. The program lending support will assist the \nGovernment in meeting the reform-related costs as well as the overall financing requirements. \nThe macroeconomic assessment letter from the International Monetary Fund is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n                                                 \n41  This  comprises  (i)  from  ADB,  $400  million  for  the  IRSDP,  $200  million  through  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram  II,  and  the  $100  million  planned  second  tranche  release  under  Loans  2126/2127(SF)-INO:  State  Audit \nReform Sector Development Program; (ii) from the World Bank, $500 million\u2013$600 million through its Development \nPolicy  Loan  3;  and  (iii)  from  the  Government  of  Japan,  $100  million\u2013$300  million  through  cofinancing  of  the \nDevelopment Policy Loans 2 and 3, and IRSDP.  \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\n73. \nIn the context of the ongoing discussions about the new country strategy and program, \nthe  Government  has  asked  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  around  $300  million\u2013$400  million  for \neach of SP2 and SP3 based on the resource requirements.  \n \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n4. \n\n \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\nBAPPENAS  will  be \n\nthe  Executing  Agency \n\n74. \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  Program  Cluster.  The  KKPPI,  chaired  by  the  coordinating  minister  for \neconomic affairs, will oversee the implementation of the Program Cluster, and provide guidance \nand direction to the line ministries in charge of the various infrastructure sectors, which will act \nas  the  implementing  agencies.  Implementation  of  the  policy  actions  will  be  coordinated  with \nseveral other agencies, including SOEs and BUMDs, in charge of infrastructure provision.  \n \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\nfor  coordinating \n\nresponsible \n\nb. \n\n \n\nThe  implementation  period  for  SP1  is  from  1  January  2005  to  30  September  2006.  All \n\n75. \nactions included in the policy matrix under SP1 have been completed during this time frame.  \n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n76. \nThe SP1 loan of $400 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the items specified \nin the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  if  the \nvalue of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan disbursed during the given year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will  be  required.  All  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member \ncountries will be procured with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with \nthe Government\u2019s standard public procedures, and normal private sector commercial practices \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be \nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nd. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy42 was explained to and discussed with the Government; and \n77. \nall  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006),  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants,  and  the  Loan  Regulations,  were  specifically  brought  to  the  notice  of  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anticorruption  efforts  since \nlate  2004.  Procurement  reforms  have  been  under  way  for  some  time,  resulting  in  competitive \nand  relatively  transparent  selection  of  bidders  by  the  public  sector.  The  PSP  regulatory \nframework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, sets out clear guidelines for the selection of private \nsector  sponsors.  The  KKPPI  is  tasked  with  ensuring  that  the  bidding  processes  are  fair  and \ntransparent. Furthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and \n\n                                                 \n42  ADB. 2006. Anticorruption.

Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive the loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated on terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n \n\nf. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n\n79. \nAs the IRSDP covers nine sectors, close to 20 line ministries and agencies, and scores \nof SOEs and BUMDs, technical coordination and progress monitoring will be critical. The KKPPI \nis mandated to coordinate, leverage, and monitor reform progress within the broader context of \nthe Infrastructure Policy Package. The line ministries, as implementing agencies, will report on \nprogress to BAPPENAS through periodic meetings. With ADB TA support, the BAPPENAS part \nof the KKPPI Secretariat will strengthen the line ministry reporting system and provide technical \ncoordination to resolve problems and facilitate implementation of pending or delayed actions. In \nline  with  CMEA  Regulation  1/2006,  the  CMEA  part  of  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  will  host  regular \nstakeholder  consultative  meetings  to  solicit  feedback  on  emerging  regulations  and  project  \nimplementation  from  the  private  sector  and  development  partner  community.  The  KKPPI \nSecretariat\u2019s  monitoring  outcomes  will  be  reported  to  the  principal  development  partners  and \nother  stakeholders.  In  addition,  joint  quarterly  reviews  of  the  overall  Program  Cluster \nperformance  will  be  undertaken  by  BAPPENAS  and  ADB,  in  coordination  with  the  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n80. \nBAPPENAS  and  ADB  will  jointly  assess  the  impact  and  evaluate  the  benefits  of  SP1 \nwithin  12  months  after  it  is  completed.  Findings  from  the  consultations  and  reviews  will  be \nutilized  in  ensuring  continuity  and  sustained  progress  of  reforms  under  SP2  and  SP3.  As  the \nIRSDP  provides  an  overall  umbrella  framework  for  medium-term  reforms,  ADB  will  also  solicit \nfeedback from a wide range of stakeholders and disseminate IRSDP implementation progress, \nwith  the  aim  of  promoting  PSP  in  infrastructure  provision.  BAPPENAS  will  actively  assist  and \nsupport  ongoing  Program  Cluster  monitoring  and  evaluation  including  facilitating  consultations \nwith  central  and  provincial  agencies,  infrastructure  sector  participants,  civil  society,  and  other \nkey stakeholders as appropriate. \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan  \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  loan  will  help  accelerate  PSP  in  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure  sectors  by \n81. \nsupporting establishment of the PDF. The PDF will alleviate one of the most critical constraints \nimpeding  infrastructure  development,  namely,  the  lack  of  adequate  project  preparation.  The \nPDF will help the Government (i) prepare feasibility studies for national and decentralized PPP \nprojects;  (ii)  adopt  open  and  transparent  bidding  processes;  and  (iii)  execute  project \ntransactions (Appendix 8). \n \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n2. \n\nThe Project has three components:  \n\n(i) \n\nPPP project preparation and transaction execution to establish \n\n82. \n \n\n \n\n\f27 \n\n \n\n(a)  a national component of the PDF to fund the preparation and bidding of \nlarge-scale    projects,  mostly  in  power,  toll-road,  and  transport  sectors; \nand \n\n(b)  a regional component of the PDF to fund the preparation and bidding of \n\nsmaller-scale decentralized regional infrastructure projects;  \n\ntechnical  advisory  services  to  the  PDF  and  capacity  building  for  PPP  project \npromotion and execution; and \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nprocurement and administrative services to the PDF. \n\n \n83. \nThe National Component of the PDF. This component will help accelerate large-scale \nPPP  project  transactions.  In  line  with  Perpres  67/2005,  it  will  finance  project  preparation  and \ntransaction execution,  leading  to  the  conclusion  of  an  appropriate  contractual  arrangement  for \nthe  project  (i.e.,  PPP  procurement).  Subsequent  project  implementation  will  not  be  financed \nfrom  the  national  component  of  the  PDF.  Its  scope  will  cover  large  national  projects,  with  a \nspecific  focus  on  preparing  about  10  projects,  concentrating  mostly  in  power,  toll-roads  and \ntransport sectors. Given the relatively poor access to infrastructure services, particularly by the \npoor, the national component of the PDF will help the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts by \naccelerating  the  necessary  investments  and  encouraging  PSP,  which  in  turn  will  have  longer \nterm multiplier effects on poverty reduction. In addition, the national component of the PDF will \nalleviate acute capacity constraints within line ministries and contracting agencies in preparing \nprojects and selecting private sector partners. \n \nThe Regional Component of the PDF. This component will support local governments \n84. \nin  preparing  at  least  40  decentralized  regional infrastructure  PPP  projects  that  would  increase \nPSP. The facility\u2019s impact will be improved regional living conditions and faster economic growth \nthrough  local  infrastructure  development.  Outcomes  include  (i)  increased  PSP  in  regional \ninfrastructure projects by enabling local governments to prepare bankable PPP projects, and (ii) \ndissemination  and  encouragement  of  best  practice  in  structuring  and  executing  PPP \ntransactions.  The  resulting  projects  will  be  ready  for  financing  and  implementation.  They  will \ngenerate business and employment opportunities for a wide range of private sector participants \nacross Indonesia.  \n \n85. \nTechnical  Advisory  Services.  This  component  will  provide  technical  advisory  service \nsupport to a project management unit (PMU) to be established in BAPPENAS to administer the \nPDF. Support for the PMU includes (i) refinement of selection criteria for providing PDF funding; \n(ii)  assessment  of  requests  for  such  funding;  (iii)  technical  evaluation  of  proposals  from \nconsultants  to  be  recruited  for  PPP  project  preparation  and  transaction  execution;  (iv)  linking \nPPP venture proponents with financial institutions capable of funding the proposed projects; (v) \nadvisory  support  to  the  KKPPI  on  cross-cutting  policy  or  regulatory  measures  in  the  areas  of \nanticorruption,  transparency,  and  dispute  resolution  that  would  elicit  greater  PSP;  and  (vi) \noverall PPP project promotion. \n \n\nImportant Features \n\n2. \n \n86. \nThe KKPPI, as coordinator of the overall infrastructure development process, will provide \noversight  of  the  PDF  through  BAPPENAS.  The  intrasectoral  prioritization  of  projects  and \nsubmission  of  requests  for  PDF  funding  will  be  done  by  the  concerned  line  ministries  or \ncontracting  agencies  at  the  national  level,  and  local  governments  and  related  agencies  at  the \ndecentralized  level.  The  PMU  will  adopt  clear  and  transparent  criteria  to  screen  requests  and \nmake recommendations for approval (Appendix 8).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n87. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $38.8 million (Table 4). The Government has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $26.5  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nGovernment of the Netherlands has advised that its formal commitment to provide $7.6 million \nin grant cofinancing may be expected immediately after ADB Board consideration. To expedite \nproject  implementation,  Board  approval  to  administer  this  proposed  grant  is  sought.  The \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  will  allocate  staff  and  other  resources  for  the  equivalent  of  $4.7 \nmillion. Table 5 presents the financing plan.  \n \n88. \nThe provision of funding from the Asian Development Fund is justified by (i) Indonesia\u2019s \nlow  infrastructure  service  coverage  ratios  compared  to  other  countries  in  the  region,  resulting \nparticularly in the poor not having access to basic infrastructure services; (ii) the need to support \nongoing efforts to systematically rebuild national and local government capacity eroded after the \nAsian  financial  crisis;  and  (iii)  Indonesia\u2019s  relatively  high  debt-to-GDP  ratio  of  45%,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s preference for borrowing on concessional terms for capacity building. \n \n\nTable 4: Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n\nComponent and Description \nA.

BAPPENAS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  head  of  the \nDirectorate  for  Public-Private  Partnerships  in  BAPPENAS  will  oversee  the  PMU  and  the  PDF. \nThe  PMU  will  coordinate  all  three  project  components.  PMU  staff  will  be  supported  by  the \ninternational and national consultants to be recruited under the technical advisory services and \ncapacity  building,  and  procurement  and  administrative  services  components.  To  ensure  full \nadherence  to  the  PPP  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  the  PMU  will  work  closely  with  the \ncentral  PPP  unit  to  be  established  under  the  Directorate  for  Public-Private  Partnerships.  A \nProject Steering Committee as outlined in para. 20 of Appendix 8 will be established to serve as \nhigh-level  decision-making  and  guiding  forum  for  the  PDF.  The  approval  authority  for  funding \nrequests  will  be  different  for  the  national  and  regional  components  of  the  PDF  (Appendix  8, \nFigure 3).   \n \n90. \nImplementation Period. Project implementation is expected to start in the first quarter \nof 2007. The first component is expected to be committed within 4 years. Thereafter, the PDF \nmay  operate  as  a  revolving  facility,  using  the  reflow  of  funds  from  the  first  batch  of  projects  if \nadequate  cost-recovery  arrangements  result  from  the  study  conducted  under  the  second \ncomponent.  The  capacity-building  and  advisory  services  under  the  second  component  will  be \nimplemented  over  5  years.  The  procurement  and  administrative  services  under  the  third \ncomponent will also be implemented over 5 years.  \n \n91. \nProcurement Arrangements: The PMU will coordinate all procurement arrangements. \nAbout  552  person-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  3,401  person-months  of \nnational  consulting  services  are  expected  to  be  needed  to  support  PDF  implementation.  The \nservices required under the second and third component will be procured by the PMU soon after \nloan  effectiveness.  The  consulting  packages  under  the  first  component  will  be  procured  on  a \nneeds basis, depending on the readiness of the concerned PPP projects. The procurement of \ngoods  such  as  computer  equipment  and  office  supplies,  predominantly  under  the  second  and \nthird component, will be through shopping or national competitive bidding as appropriate. \n \n92. \nSafeguard  Considerations.  The  PDF  will  not  finance  any  investments  in  project \nimplementation,  as  they  will  support  only  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  and  PPP \nthe  concession  agreement  (or  other  contractual \nprocurement  up \narrangements). Requests for any subsequent ADB financing for project investments will be dealt \nwith  separately,  and  will  be  subject  to  all  of  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  particularly  with  regard  to \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  As  ADB  financing  is  not  assumed  at  the  project \npreparation  stage,  the  PDF  will  not  be  able  to  enforce  ADB\u2019s  detailed  safeguard  policies. \nHowever,  the  principles  of  these  policies  will  be  applied.  Environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment,  including  issues  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples,  will  be \nintegral  components  in  the  preparation  of  PPP  projects  to  be  supported  by  the  PDF.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  developed  before \nfinancing any feasibility studies. \n \n\nthe  signing  of \n\nto \n\nIV. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n93. \nIn  December  2005  (footnote  15)  ADB  approved  TA  to  support  the  BAPPENAS  part  of \nthe  KKPPI  Secretariat  in  (i)  enhancing  its  technical  capacity,  (ii)  developing  an  overall  PSO \nframework,  (iii)  developing  a  harmonized  regulatory  framework  for  the  various  infrastructure \nsectors,  and  (iv)  screening  and  preparing  projects.  Subsequently,  the  Government  has  asked \nADB  for  TA  to  implement  the  risk  management  framework  adopted  by  MOF  as  part  of  the \nfinancing \nIRSDP,  and  design \n\ninstitutional  arrangements \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe  various \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n30 \n\n \n\nmechanisms  currently  under  consideration  that  ensure  sound  fiduciary  governance  in  the \nprovision of Government support for PPP projects. \n  \n94. \n \n\nThe proposed TA for Enhancing PSP in Infrastructure Provision will focus on  \n\neffective  implementation  of  the  risk-management  framework,  leading  to  greater \nPSP; \ncapacity building for establishing and managing the various infrastructure funds;  \neffective  communication  and  social  marketing  of  the  reform  agenda  to  a  wide \nrange of stakeholders; and \nstart  up  activities  and  documentation  needed  to  support  preliminary  technical \npreparations prior to the consideration of projects by the PDF.   \n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,500,000. ADB will finance $2,000,000 from its \n95. \nTA funding program, and the Government will provide counterpart support in the equivalent of \n$500,000. Appendix 9 presents details on the TA. \n  \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n \n96. \n \n\nThe key benefits expected from the IRSDP are \n\nsustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term economic growth \nobjectives, as articulated in the RPJM for 2006\u20132009; \nimprovements  in  the  investment  climate,  to  be  demonstrated  by  sound  policy, \nlegal, and institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \ngreater potential for PSP, and a more systematic approach for implementing PPP \ntransactions; \npreparation and implementation of quality infrastructure projects in a transparent \nand  expedient  manner,  resulting  in  (a)  improved  availability  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure  services;  (b)  a  boost  to  Indonesia\u2019s  competitiveness  versus  its \nregional  neighbors;  and  (c)  lower  poverty  incidence,  through  direct  as  well  as \nindirect transmission channels; \nsustained engagement by ADB in the policy dialogue with the Government on the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional reform agenda in the broader area of investment climate; the IRSDP \nwill  provide  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in  areas  where  ADB  has  been \nactively involved; and \naid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners (ADB, \nGovernment of Japan, and World Bank) around a common policy framework and \ndialogue, and the positive externalities resulting from such a joint endorsement of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n\n \n97. \nInstitutional.  The  IRSDP  will  strengthen  the  key  institutions  dealing  with  infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  Indonesia.  At  the  national  level,  the  KKPPI,  its  secretariat  and  the  Risk \nManagement  Unit  in  MOF  are  expected  to  evolve  into  strong  institutions  coordinating  central \nsupport  for  infrastructure  development  through  greater  PSP.  Within  each  infrastructure  sector, \nthe regulatory bodies will be strengthened over the medium term by making them independent, \nclarifying  their  mandate,  and  providing  adequate  resources  for  their  operations.  The  role  of \nSOEs will be redefined during IRSDP implementation. This will enhance their competitiveness \nto effectively  work in an environment with  much greater PSP.  Overall, the capacity to prepare \nand execute bankable projects will be considerably enhanced. Supported by the planned long-\n\n \n\n\f31 \n\nfinancial \n\ninfrastructure \n\nthe  country\u2019s \n\nfinancing  mechanisms, \n\nterm \ninstitutions  will  be \nstrengthened.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  local  governments  as  well  as  BUMDs  will  be \nclarified. \n  \n98. \nSocial. The IRSDP\u2019s main contribution is to improve the investment climate, and thereby \ncontribute directly to poverty reduction, through greater access to markets, and economic and \nemployment  opportunities,  among  others.  The  adjustments  in  oil  prices  have  already  reduced \nwasteful  spending  considerably.  The  Government  has  utilized  the  additional  fiscal  space  for \nmore pro-poor spending. The Government will review tariff policies in all sectors and adopt tariff \nregimes  that  are  in  line  with  cost-recovery  principles.  At  the  same  time,  the  impact  of  tariff \nincreases on the poor will be mitigated through appropriate measures, and the PSO framework \nwill  be  strengthened  to  effectively  deliver  essential  infrastructure  services.  The  adoption  of \ntransparent, market-based and competitive pricing will promote PSP,  which in turn will lead to \ngreater  tax  and  non-tax  revenues,  and  additional  employment  opportunities.  The  lessons \nlearned from the post-fuel-subsidy program will be incorporated by the Government in designing \nappropriate  PSO  mechanisms.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  possible  negative  impact  of \nexpedient approaches to land acquisition. The recently adopted Perpres 36/2005 as amended \nby Perpres 65/2006 (paras.23 and 46) attempts to bring the Government\u2019s legal framework on \nland  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  closer  to  ADB\u2019s  policies.  If  the  ongoing  dialogue \naimed at strengthening the draft implementing regulations for Perpres 36/2005 and 65/2005 is \nsuccessful,  the  Government\u2019s  legal  framework  will  be  more  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements. \nThe  Government  is  also  considering  alternative  approaches  to  provide  speedy  compensation \nand  enhance  administrative  accountability  through  open  and  transparent  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms.  Overall,  the  IRSDP  is  likely  to  lead  to  significant  social  benefits.  Appendix  10 \npresents a summary poverty reduction and social impact analysis. \n \n99. \nEconomic. The nature of the IRSDP\u2014a policy reform program\u2014does not lend itself to a \nquantitative financial and economic analysis. Nevertheless, major general economic benefits will \naccrue to the entire Indonesian population through the IRSDP through the expanded scope and \nimproved quality of infrastructure services. The rigorous project preparation, screening, bidding, \nand  contracting  processes  will  enhance  the  direct  and  indirect  economic  impacts  of  project \ntransactions. Through its secretariat, the KKPPI will review the financial and economic analyses \nfor all proposed PPP projects. The IRSDP will provide support to the KKPPI Secretariat in this \nregard,  and  ensure  that  sound  assessments  are  carried  out  and  the  economic  benefits  are \nhighlighted. Board documents for SP2 and SP3 will present updates on such assessments.   \n \n100.  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environment.  Perpres  36/2005  and  Perpres \n65/2006  recognize  traditional  communal  land  ownership  (Hak  Ulayat)  and  usufruct  rights.43  In \nline with the regulatory provisions, the rights of indigenous peoples will be upheld in the case of \nany  land  acquisition  involving  them.  These  provisions  are  in  conformity  with  requirements \noutlined  in  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples.44  ADB  is  preparing  an  advisory  TA  to \nstrengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  for  social  assessment  and  resettlement  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring; and if necessary, to assist in strengthening the legal framework \nif  the  implementing  regulations  for  Perpres  36/2005  and  Perpres  65/2006  are  found  to  be \ninadequate.  Based  on  a  desk  review,  the  IRSDP  measures  are  unlikely  to  have  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  Further,  while  the  IRSDP  facilitates  the  preparation  and  bidding  of \nseveral  model  PPP  projects,  it  will  not  provide  any  investment  support  to  such  projects. \nNonetheless, the Government, through the KKPPI, will ensure that all social and environmental \nsafeguards  are  complied  with  in  line  with  the  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.  Any  projects  to \n\n                                                 \n43  Subject  to  the  caveat  in  para.  98  that  appropriate  implementing  regulations  would  ensure  a  complete  alignment \n\nbetween what is outlined in these perpreses and ADB policies.  \n44  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.

Coordination  Problems  and  Conflict  of  Interest.  Progress  of  infrastructure  reforms \nhas  been  impeded  by  poor  coordination,  and  competing  and  conflicting  interests  of  various \nstakeholders. In particular, political economy considerations and the lack of coordination and of \na  coherent  vision  to  guide  infrastructure  development  prevented  sector  liberalization  and \nrestructuring  of  key  institutions  in  the  past.  Over  2005\u20132006,  the  Government,  at  the  highest \nlevels, has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to pursue the medium-term reforms to promote \nPSP. While full and effective coordination and reforms in certain sectors may take time to evolve \nand  will  need  significant  consensus  building,  the  essential  steps  taken  thus  far  will  have  a \ndemonstrational effect in supporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner.  \n\n102.  Poor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in large infrastructure \nprojects  in  several  sectors,  the  IRSDP  may  face  significant  impediments  in  the  form  of  weak \ngovernance, collusion, and corruption. In particular, despite the commendable rigid stance taken \nby MOF, risks of misallocation of scarce public resources could still be encountered, leading to \npublic support for directly negotiated projects or projects that do not meet all relevant criteria for \nsuch  support  during  the  transition  period.  Problems  of  a  similar  nature  have  not  been \nuncommon in the past in Indonesia. However, the Government has put in place a sound legal \nframework  and  a  good  mechanism  of  checks  and  balances.  Equally  important  is  the  much \ngreater degree of transparency and public debate even on such sensitive issues, which in turn \noffers a natural firewall around the use of budget resources and ensures compliance with due \nprocesses.  Further,  the  Government  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anticorruption  efforts \nover the last year.  \n\n103.  Social  Tensions.  Tariff  reforms  are  sensitive  in  any  environment,  and  Indonesia  is  no \nexception. As the country gradually moves away from the current system of administered prices \nfor  infrastructure  services,  social  tensions  will  be  inevitable.  However,  the  savings  from  the \nreduction in inefficient subsidies will enable the Government to reorient its public expenditures \ntoward poverty reduction, employment generation, and rural infrastructure development. \n\n104.  Adverse  Economic  Developments.  Domestic  macroeconomic  volatility  or  the  lack  of \nsustained momentum on policy reforms, or adverse regional events that have a contagion effect \non  the  Indonesian  economy,  would  impede  PSP.  Over  the  last  3\u20134  years,  the  Indonesian \neconomy has been quite resilient to domestic and external shocks. The Government recognizes \nand has addressed investors\u2019 concerns about policy reforms.  \n\n105.  Sectarian and Regional Conflicts, and Security Concerns. The Government and law \nenforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of  effective  measures  to  resolve  such  conflicts, \nwhich could slow private investments, and to rebuild public and investor confidence.  \n  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n106. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used \nto finance the development needs as outlined under the IRSDP implementation \narrangements. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n33 \n\nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the IRSDP loan agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  letter  of  development  policy  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the IRSDP and subsequently. \nThe  Government  shall  cause  the  line  ministries,  contracting  agencies,  and \nregional  governments  to  ensure  that  the  projects  financed  by  the  PDF  will  be \ndesigned and implemented in strict conformity with the applicable national laws, \nregulations, and policies; competitive and transparent processes; and all relevant \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  standards;  and  that  the  environmental  and \nsocial  assessments  are  carried  out  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures, \nincluding monitoring, are prepared and implemented. \nThe studies and technical designs prepared for the projects and other consulting \nservices  provided  will  broadly  comply  with  all  relevant  ADB  requirements, \npolicies, and guidelines. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation are provided fully and in a timely manner. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply

facilities  constructed  and  the  resulting  increases  in  the  access  to  infrastructure  services.  The  sector \nmaster plans and blueprints do include such targets but their achievement, particularly in the medium term, is doubtful \nbecause of the continued lack of public and private investments. The targets in this design and monitoring framework \ntherefore focus on measures to increase investments, with the understanding that the master plans and blueprints will \nbe revised and updated under subprogram 2 to provide more realistic access and other physical targets, together with \ninstitutional and financing strategies for achieving these. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\n \n\nInvestment Requirements  \n\nThis  appendix  discusses  specific \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nthe  various \ninfrastructure sectors in Indonesia, with a summary provided in Table A2.

The  circles  are \npositioned  against  each  sector\u2019s  potential  for  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  on  the  vertical \naxis2  and  the  gap  between  each  sector\u2019s  service  coverage  and  the  regional  average  on  the \nhorizontal axis.3 In terms of unmet investment requirements, the power sector is leading, closely \nfollowed  by  urban  services4  and  roads.  In  terms  of  PSP  potential,  the  gas  sector  is  a  front-\nrunner, with the other sectors clustered below the middle line. \n \n\nissues  and  constraints \n\nfaced \n\nin \n\nFigure A2: Gaps in Infrastructure Provision in Indonesia \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh \n\nPrivatization \nEquity \nInvestment \n\nBuilt-Operate- \nTransfer \n\nConcession \n\nManagement  \nContract \n\n \n\n \nl\na\ni\nt\nn\ne\nt\no\nP\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\nS\n \ne\nt\na\nv\ni\nr\nP\n\nConstruction \n\nLow\n\nRail \n\n50.0 \n\nInfrastructure Investment Needs Versus  \nService Coverage and Private Sector Potential \n\nGas\n\nScale: $5 Billion \n\nPower\n\nRoads\n\nPorts Airports\n\nUrban \n\n40.0 \nService Coverage (% below the regional average) \n\n10.0 \n\n30.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n0.0 \n\nSource: ADB staff, based on Government data.\n\n \n\nRoads \n\n \nB. \n \nSince  roads  account  for  the  major  share  of  domestic  freight  and  interurban  passenger \n2. \nland travel in Indonesia, their coverage and condition are crucial to supporting economic growth \nand social development. Yet the road density, at 0.19 kilometers (km) per square km or 1.7 km \nper  1,000  people,  is  among  the  lowest  in  Southeast  Asia.  While  investments  in  road  network \nupgrading  and  expansion  were  substantial  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  sector  expenditures \ndecreased  sharply  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  from  a  peak  of  around  22%  of  the  overall \npublic  budget  in  the  mid-1990s  to  about  10%  in  recent  years.  National  arterial  roads  are  in  a \nrelatively good condition, but almost half are congested, increasing costs for industry and trade, \nand  the  network  comprises  only  about  600  km  of  high-grade  toll  roads.  Provincial  roads  are \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank estimates. \n2   For example, the position of the power sector reflects the mix of a relatively high potential for PSP through build-\noperate-transfer projects in generation and a low PSP potential for construction in transmission and distribution. \n3   The  regional  average  is  based  on  data  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  For  example,  with  an  electrification  ratio  of  57%,  Indonesia\u2019s  power  sector  is  33 \npercentage points below the regional average of 85%.  \n\n4   Urban services include water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, and urban transport. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ngenerally  well  preserved,  but  district  and  urban  roads  are  in  poor  condition,  with  about  30% \nunpaved, thus restricting all-season access. In terms of spending, national arterial roads have \nbeen  fairly  well  preserved,  but  the  backlog  of  investments  in  network  improvement  and \nextension  is  growing.  The  regional  situation  is  reversed,  with  underspending  on  preservation \nleading  to  greater  strains  than  underspending  in  road  development.  Overall,  of  the  estimated \nminimum  annual  funding  requirements  of  Rp31  trillion  ($3.3  billion),  only  Rp12  billion  ($1.3 \nbillion)  is  currently  met.  This  underlines  the  need  for  additional  domestic  and  foreign  financial \nresources.  \n \nThe  current  vehicle  acquisition  and  ownership  taxes,  and  fuel  and  other  operational \n3. \ntaxes  would  cover  about  70%  of  the  necessary  road  maintenance  costs.  However,  proceeds \nfrom vehicle revenues are treated as general tax revenues of the regional governments and not \ndesignated for road preservation. The potential for financing the maintenance of road assets on \na  self-sustained  basis  is  thus  not  utilized.  Until  recently,  taxes  imposed  on  road  users  were \ndwarfed  by  subsidies  received  in  the  form  of  low  domestic  prices  of  motor  fuels.  The  gradual \nremoval  of  fuel  subsidies  needs  to  continue,  with  a  portion  of  the  savings  redirected  to  road \ndevelopment.  While  road  preservation  can  be  fully  financed  domestically  through  restructured \nroad user charges, additional funds need to be mobilized for road development from the private \nsector and foreign borrowings. The private sector can be engaged in constructing and operating \nabout 1,500 km of high-grade toll roads to provide a complete trans-Java link and major parts of \nthe  trans-Sumatra  link,  while  foreign  borrowings  may  be  used  in  an  efficient  manner  for \nimproving and extending the national arterial road network, rather than for road preservation. \n \nC. \n \nPorts  and  airports  are  of  vital  importance  to  regional  cooperation  and  integration  for \n4. \nIndonesia, an archipelago. In particular, the maritime sector comprising ports and shipping is a \nkey mode for domestic and international trade and passenger travel.5 Sea cargo traffic was only \nslightly  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  and  is  projected  to  grow  at  6%  per  annum  for \ninternational cargo and 4% per annum for domestic cargo. By contrast, sea passenger traffic did \nshow some decline after the crisis that is expected to continue in the next few years before slow \ngrowth at 2% per annum is resumed. \n \nDeficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  and  handling  equipment  include  draft  restrictions  in \n5. \nsome of the strategic ports that inhibit their ability to receive large vessels and fully participate in \nregional  trade.  Inadequate  equipment  is  the  main  cause  of  generally  low  port  productivity  in \nterms  of  average  berth  occupancy  rate,  turnaround  time,  and  containerization  rate.  Overall, \noperational  performance  and  service  provision  have  not  met  client  expectations  and \ninternational performance standards. In particular, performance in container terminal operations \nis considered unsatisfactory by port users. Port tariffs are low, allowing full cost recovery only in \nlarger ports. With the introduction of the International Ship and Port Security Code in July 2004, \nall  Indonesian  international  ports  face  the  challenge  of  implementing  strict  security  measures; \nreceiving  ports  can  reject  docking  of  ships  with  cargo  from  ports  that  do  not  meet  the  code \nrequirements. \n \nAir  transport  also  plays  a  vital  role  for  passengers,  and  high-value  cargo  and  mail  by \n6. \nfacilitating mobility, generating economic activity, and providing lifeline access to remote areas, \n\nPorts and Airports \n\n                                                 \n5   In 2003, about 600 million tons of cargo and 10 million passengers were accommodated by 725 public and 1,478 \nprivate  ports,  of  which  141  were  classified  as  international  ports.  Twenty-five  public  ports  designated  by  the \nGovernment as strategic ports providing the main gateway for passengers and cargo handle most of the container \ntraffic. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nthus helping integrate the islands across the country.6 The civil aviation industry suffered from \nfinancial losses after the Asian financial crisis, but has bounced back and is now carrying about \n60%  more  traffic  than  before  the  crisis.  This  is  attributable  to  lower  airfares  as  a  result  of \ncompetition in air transport and increasing geographic coverage of air transport services. Long-\nterm  projections  indicate  annual  growth  of  5%  for  domestic  passenger  traffic  and  6%  for \ninternational passenger traffic. \n \n7. \nWhile the capacity of the airside facilities is sufficient in the main airports, terminals and \naprons are sometimes inadequate. The same is true for many secondary and tertiary airports. \nAir  traffic  security  also  needs  to  be  addressed.  Domestic  airport  tariffs  are  kept  artificially  low \nand do not allow cost recovery for services provided to passengers and air carriers. As a result, \nonly major airports with significant international traffic are able to break even in their operations. \nThe initiative for proposing increases in airport tariffs lies with the airport operator. However, the \noperator is required to consult with users, local governments, and the Ministry of Transportation \n(MOT).  Experience  with  tariff  increases  indicates  that  they  are  difficult  to  implement  due  to \nstrong resistance usually expressed during the consultation process. As with ports, security of \nstrategic airports needs to be enhanced to deal effectively with security concerns. \n \nThe  current  legal  framework7  defines  the  various  categories  of  ports  and  airports; \n8. \nspecifies  that  management  of  all  general  ports  and  all  airports  is  the  responsibility  of  the \nGovernment,  which  can  delegate  it  to  a  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE);  and  allows  PSP  only \nthrough  a  cooperation  agreement  with  an  SOE.  Based  on  this  framework,  the  Government \nidentified groups of ports and airports that are considered commercial (i.e., generate operating \nprofits or have the potential to do so), and allocated their management and development to six \nSOEs: (i) 111 ports to four Indonesian port corporations (PELINDO I to IV), and (ii) 23 airports to \ntwo  airport  corporations  (Angkasa  Pura  I  and  II).  In  reality  these  portfolios  contain  a  mix  of \nprofitable  and  unprofitable  assets,  arranged  in  geographic  proximity,  and  with  positive \naggregate  results.  The  SOEs  exercise  monopoly  rights  over  the  ports  and  airports  in  their \nportfolios,  managing  all  aspects  of  operation,  development,  and  PSP.  They  also  act  as  a \nregulator  in  their  domain,  setting  tariffs  for  the  use  of  port/airport  infrastructure  and  for \nport/airport services  in consultation  with  MOT.  MOT,  or  Angkasa  Pura I  or  II  provide  air  traffic \nservices, depending on the airport. This fragmented approach presents coordination and safety \nproblems. \n \n9. \nBoth ports and airports have good potential for PSP, but actual PSP is low given the lack \nof a clear and predictable regulatory and investment environment, and the lack of a level playing \nfield  providing  equal  access  and  opportunities  to  all  investors.  In  the  port  sector,  three  of  the \nfour  PELINDOs  have  formed  joint  ventures  with  private  operators.  These  deal  structures,  with \nthe PELINDOs acting as both landlord8 and operator, deter further PSP, as potential investors \nin new port terminals will not expect fair treatment from a landlord with a financial stake in an \nexisting operator. PSP in the airport sector has been very limited, and generally taken the form \nof  subcontracts  for  selected  landside  services.  Another  impediment  to  PSP  has  been \nuncertainty caused by regional autonomy legislation, which confers authority over public works, \n\n                                                 \n6  In  2003,  aircraft  movements  in  Indonesia\u2019s  186  airports,  24  of  them  international,  totaled  about  500,000,  and  air \ntraffic passengers\u2014departures and arrivals\u2014about 22 million. Three airports\u2014Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Ngurah \nRai in Denpasar, and Juanda in Surabaya\u2014accounted for more than 60% of the passenger traffic. \n\n7 Maritime Law 21/1992, Government Regulation 69/2001, and the implementing ministerial decrees 53, 54, 55, and \n56/2002  for  ports;  and  Aviation  Law  15/1992,  Government  Regulation  70/2001,  and  the  implementing  ministerial \ndecrees 44,45, and 48/2002 for airports. \n\n8 Landlord functions in ports and airports include berth/terminal assignment, allocation of shed and warehouse space, \ncontrol  of  all  vehicles  that  enter  and  leave  the  ports/airports,  cleaning  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  and \ncollection of fees. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRailways \n\nincluding ports and airports, to local governments.9 This has created a potential for conflict with \nthe PELINDOs and Angkasa Puras. \n \nD. \n \nThe  railway  sector  is  very  small  in  international  terms  and  relative  to  Indonesia\u2019s  size \n10. \nand  population.  It  accounts  for  less  than  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  passenger  traffic  and  less \nthan  1%  of  its  total  freight  traffic.  Railway  operations  are  limited  to  predominantly  passenger \nservices in Java and three separate networks in Sumatra that carry mainly cargo such as coal \nand cement. The total rail length is less than 6,000 km, mainly single-track route-km, of which \nabout one quarter is in a nonoperating condition. Most railway assets are old and deteriorating \n(e.g.,  over  two  thirds  of  serviceable  rolling  stock  is  more  than  20  years  old).  Despite  that,  the \naverage utilization of labor and infrastructure is higher than in Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam.  \n \n11. \nBased  on  Law  13/1992  on  Railways  and  the  related  implementing  regulations,  in \nparticular  the  Government  Regulation  69/1998  on  Train  Traffic  and  Transportation,  the \nGovernment  through  MOT  is  responsible  for  sector  policy  and  planning,  regulation,  and \nprovision  of  basic  infrastructure  such  as  rail  tracks  and  signaling,  while  the  fully  state-owned \nIndonesia  Railway  Corporation  (KAI)  is  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the \ninfrastructure,  and  providing  all  rail  transport  services.  PSP  is  allowed  through  a  cooperation \nagreement  with  KAI,  but  none  has  materialized  so  far.  Since  2000,  KAI  has  experienced \ndeclining and then stagnating demand due to low competitiveness of rail vis-\u00e0-vis road, air, and \nferry  services;  however  it  reports  small  profits.  Its  real  profitability  is  obscured  by  poorly \nimplemented funding arrangements, as KAI operates within a complex web of subsidies, public \nservice  obligation  arrangements,  contracts  with  other  SOEs,  and  caps  on  its  economy-class \npassenger fares. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nAlthough the state-owned monopoly State Electricity Corporation (PLN) connected about \n32  million  new  customers  to  its  system  between  1974  and  2004  (i.e.,  an  average  of  almost  1 \nmillion  per  year),  the  electrification  ratio  of  57%  is  still  low  by  regional  standards.10  About  90 \nmillion people lack access to electricity, and about two thirds of them live outside of Java and \nBali  where  the  cost  of  power  supply  is  substantially  higher.  Because  of  the  universal  tariff \nstructure  prevailing  in  Indonesia,  PLN  is  losing  money  with  every  residential  customer  it \nconnects  outside  the  Java-Bali  grid.11  Given  the  potentially  huge  number  of  such  consumers, \nthere  are  limits  to  cross-subsidization  by  other  consumer  categories.  Rural  electrification  thus \nruns  counter  to  PLN\u2019s  obligation  as  an  SOE  to  make  a  profit.12  The  implication  is  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s ambitious target of providing electricity to 90% of the population by 2020 will be \ndifficult  to  achieve  with  the  business-as-usual  approach.13  A  new  rural  electrification  strategy \nneeds to be developed and implemented, based on innovative decentralized models for design, \n\nPower \n\n                                                 \n9  Law  on  Regional  Autonomy  22/1999,  Government  Regulation  25/2000,  and  the  revised  Law  on  Regional \nAutonomy  32/2004.  Government  regulations  69  and  70/2001  issued  to  clarify  the  responsibilities  of  local \ngovernments, PELINDOs, and Angkasa Puras have not achieved the desired result. \n\n10  The electrification ratio may be underestimated. Other estimates indicate 67%, but even that is significantly below \n\nthe regional average. \n\n11  Most of the off-grid regions are supplied by diesel power plants at a cost of more than Rp2,000/kilowatt-hour (kWh) \n\nand are dominated by small residential consumers charged less than Rp600/kWh. \n\n12  Law on State-Owned Enterprises 19/2003. \n13  The  average  annual  growth  rate  in  the  number  of  PLN  customers  of  11.1%  during  the  past  30  years  has  been \nimpressive. However, two different patterns of growth occurred: 15.3% per year before the financial crisis, 1974\u2013\n1997, and 6.4% thereafter. The sharply  lower postcrisis  growth  is attributable to investment financing constraints \nand PLN\u2019s profit-making obligation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nfinancing,  implementation,  and  operation.  Local  development  utilities,  either  in  the  form  of  a \ncooperative  or  a  partnership  between  a  local  government-owned  enterprise  (BUMD)  and  a \nprivate  service  provider,  provide  a  promising  approach  that  can  be  best  pursued  through  a \ncombination of centralized planning and coordination, and decentralized implementation. \n \nPLN\u2019s  current  installed  capacity  of  about  21,800  megawatts  (MW)  and  the  capacity  of \n13. \nabout  3,400  MW  contracted  from  independent  power  producers  are  insufficient  to  meet  peak \ndemand  outside  the  main  grid  of  Java-Bali  and  leave  an  inadequate  margin  within  it.  The \noperation  of  the  many  captive,  mostly  diesel,  power  plants14  has  become  too  costly  following \nremoval  of  the  fuel  subsidy.  Power  demand  is  projected  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  6.6% \nthrough  2013.15  To  meet  the  forecast  demand,  1,000\u20132,000  MW  of  additional  generating \ncapacity needs to be commissioned annually. PLN has a sound generation expansion program, \nconsisting of five projects totaling 2,930 MW that will be commissioned during 2006\u2013200716 and \neight projects totaling 3,670 MW that are being put up for bidding in a staged manner.17 The fact \nthat  all  these  projects  except  Cilegon  and  Musi  are  to  be  executed  on  an  independent  power \nproducer basis underlines the importance of a supportive environment  for private investors. In \naddition  to  these  capacity  additions  for  meeting  the  growing  demand,  the  Government  has \nembarked on a program to install within three years another 10,000 MW of coal-fired capacity \nthrough an export-credit financed crash program to displace existing high-cost oil-based power \nplants that are the primary cause of PLN\u2019s sharply deteriorated financial position.  \n \nThe  Electricity  Law  20/2002  provides  a  progressive  long-term  vision  for  power  sector \n14. \nrestructuring  by  unbundling  PLN,  independent  regulation,  competition,  and  PSP.  However,  in \nDecember 2004, the Constitutional Court annulled this law on the grounds that its provisions for \nunbundling  and  competition  violated  the  1945  Constitution.  The  annulment  was  based  on  the \ninterpretation  of  the  constitutional  requirement  for  state  control  of  important  branches  of \nproduction,  with  the  Government  and  SOEs  acting  as  owners  and  managers.  The  annulment \nhas  been  a  serious  setback \nfar-reaching \nconsequences for sector efficiency and financial sustainability, as well as investor confidence. A \nnew  draft  electricity  law  is  undergoing  a  second  round  of  deliberations  in  Parliament.  Some \nmembers  of  Parliament,  Ministry  of  SOEs,  and  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  industry  and  trade \nassociations, community groups, and academicians) have recommended that PLN be split into \ntwo  entities  and  that  its  monopoly  rights  are  revoked.  The  generally  held  view  is  that  the  new \nlaw should allow for more participation from regional governments (e.g., by creating municipal \nutilities), private sector, and community associations. \n \nThrough  a  series  of  electricity  tariff  increases,18  renegotiation  of  independent  power \n15. \nproducer contracts,19 loan restructuring, government subsidies,20 and efficiency improvements, \n\nfor  power  sector  reforms,  with  potentially \n\n                                                 \n14  Approximately 10,000 companies maintain their own sources of power, mostly to mitigate the risks of grid supply \noutages.  The  combined  installed  capacity  of  these  captive  power  plants  is  estimated  at  13,000\u201315,000  MW,  or \nroughly half of PLN\u2019s total capacity.  \n\n15  Directorate  General  of  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization.  2004.  National  Electricity  Master  Plan  2004.  Jakarta. \n\nPLN\u2019s power development plan for 2006\u20132015 is based on demand growth of 8.5% per annum.  \n\n16  Cilacap  in  Central  Java  (600  MW,  coal);  Cilegon  in  West  Java  (740  MW,  natural  gas,  implemented  by  PLN  with \nJapan Bank for International  Cooperation financing); Tanjung Jati B  in  Central Java (1,320 MW, coal); Patuha in \nCentral Java (60 MW, geothermal), and Musi in Sumatra (210 MW, hydropower, implemented by PLN with Asian \nDevelopment Bank financing). \n\n17  Cirebon in West Java (600 MW, coal, bidding underway); Central Java (1,200 MW, coal); Pasuruan in East Java \n(500 MW, natural gas); Paiton 3 and 4 in East Java (800 MW, coal); Bali (200 MW, coal); Sibolga in North Sumatra \n(200 MW, coal); Amurang in North Sulawesi (50 MW, coal); and East Kalimantan (120 MW, natural gas). \n\n18  The average electricity tariff was increased by 29% in April 2000, 17% in July/October 2001, and through quarterly \nadjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from about $0.025/kWh after the \nAsian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major accomplishment and proof of the successful socialization \nby the Government of this politically sensitive issue. Since then, the average tariff has decreased to $0.062/kWh \ndue to rupiah depreciation and changes in the consumption structure. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nOil and Gas \n\nPLN  managed  to  overcome  the  disastrous  effects  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  and  gradually \nreduce  its  net  operating  loss  from  Rp5.5  trillion  in  1999  until  a  net  operating  income  of  Rp2.6 \ntrillion  was  generated  in  2004.21  However,  the  fuel  subsidy  removal  in  2005  has  had  a  major \nnegative impact on the financial performance of PLN, which uses diesel oil for almost 20% of its \ngeneration.  Despite  a  massive  subsidy  of  Rp12.5  trillion,  the  positive  trend  was  reversed  in \n2005, as PLN was unable to pass the sharp domestic oil price increases on to its customers. In \n2006 the subsidy is projected to more than double to about Rp28 trillion.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nAlthough Indonesia is the world\u2019s sixth largest natural gas producer and supplies about a \nquarter of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas from its fields in Aceh and Kalimantan, until recently \nthe  abundance  of  cheap  oil  limited  the  domestic  use  of  natural  gas.  Moreover,  lack  of  clarity \nregarding  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  poor  incentives  in  terms  of  return  on \ninvestment  hampered  expansion  in  current  production-sharing  contracts  and  new  gas  field \nexploration.22 Several recent developments have set the stage for natural gas playing a much \nmore important role. First, Indonesia has been on the verge of becoming a net oil importer over \nthe last two years. Second, the fuel subsidy reductions in March and October 2005 have made \nnatural gas competitive. Third, the legal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a \nresult,  private  investors  are  poised  to  develop  new  large  gas  fields,  and  PLN  is  keen  to \nsubstantially  increase  the  share  of  natural  gas  in  its  generation  mix.  Major  pipeline  projects \nand/or liquefied natural gas terminals need to be implemented to bring natural gas to the Java \nmarket. For the former, a public-private partnership project successfully completed by the State \nGas Corporation (PGN) is one possible approach.23 \n \nThe  Oil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001,  together  with  the  related  implementing  regulations,24 \n17. \nprovides a basis for gas sector restructuring by ending the monopoly of the State Oil and Gas \nCorporation  (Pertamina)  both  in  the  upstream  and  downstream  part  of  the  sector,  and \nestablishing  separate  contracting  authorities  for  these  parts  (BP  Migas  and  BPH  Migas). \nThough similar in its philosophy to the annulled Electricity Law 20/2002 (para. 14), the Oil and \nGas  Law  22/2001  was  upheld  by  the  Constitutional  Court  in  December  2005,  except  for \nprovisions  related  to  domestic  market  obligations,  and  oil  and  gas  pricing.  The  Constitutional \nCourt ruled that a minimum allocation for the domestic market should be stipulated for oil and \ngas producers, and that gas prices should be set administratively rather than be determined by \ncompetition.  \n \n\n                                                 \n19  The renegotiations were a complex and protracted exercise with a successful final outcome. Of the 27 independent \npower  producer  contracts  totaling  11,300  MW,  14  contracts  for  5,690  MW  were  continued  under  renegotiated \nterms, 6 contracts for 4,490 MW were terminated, 6 contracts for 900 MW were acquired by the Government and \nits SOEs, and only 1 contract for 220 MW ended in a legal dispute. \n\n20  The subsidies  were  introduced to compensate PLN for its low tariff for small consumers and amounted to Rp4.7 \n\ntrillion in 2002, Rp4.1 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.5 trillion in 2004. \n\n21  PLN\u2019s net income after interest, taxes, and foreign exchange losses was negative throughout this period, but the \n\nloss decreased from Rp6.1 trillion in 2002 to Rp2.0 trillion in 2004. \n\n22  Gas contracts signed before 1971 still account for almost 60% of Indonesia\u2019s commercial reserves, and large gas \n\nfields have remained unexplored. \n\n23  PGN  created  a  subsidiary  company  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Grissik-Duri-Batam-Singapore  gas \ntransmission pipelines with a combined length of about 1,000 kilometers and divested a stake in this company to a \nstrategic  investor  through  a  competitive  bidding  process.  The  project  was  supported  by  an  Asian  Development \nBank loan of $218 million, with cofinancing of $195 million provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \n\n24  The  government  regulations  on \n\nImplementing  Agency  (BP  Migas),  Regulatory  Agency  (BPH  Migas), \nCorporatization  of  Pertamina,  Upstream  Businesses,  Downstream  Businesses,  and  Appointment  of  the  Head  of \nImplementing  Agency,  as  well  as  the  Presidential  Decree  on  the  Establishment  of  Regulatory  Agency,  issued \nduring 2002\u20132004.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n43 \n\nTelecommunications \n\n18. \nBPH  Migas  has  undergone  capacity  building  to  fully  operationalize  its  downstream \nregulatory  functions.  Under  the  current  arrangements,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources is responsible for policy making, regulation of upstream activities, and together with \nBPH Migas, regulation of downstream activities.25 BP Migas acts as the contracting authority for \nupstream work and BPH Migas for downstream.  \n \nG. \n \n19. \nExcept  for  a  few  years  when  the  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  was  strongly  felt \nacross the country, the fixed line service has shown double-digit annual growth since 1970. The \ntotal  number  of  fixed  lines  exceeds  11  million,  but  given  Indonesia\u2019s  large  population,  the \ncoverage is among the lowest in the region.26 A large disparity exists between urban and rural \nareas.27 As elsewhere in the region, mobile communication has enjoyed explosive growth since \n1995,  reaching  about  27  million  mobile  phone  users  in  2004.  The  density  is  thus  more  than \ntwice as high as for fixed lines.28 While the number of Internet users has also increased to about \n8 million, Indonesia lags most countries in the region.29 \n \nUntil  1999  the  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  telecommunications  services  was \n20. \nassigned  to  two  SOEs.  Telkom  was  designated  as  the  so-called  organizing  body  and  granted \nexclusivity for domestic services (both local and long distance), while Indosat played this role for \ninternational  services.  Law  36/1999  on  Telecommunications  and  the  related  implementing \nregulations provided the basis for major sector reforms. These are outlined in the 1999 sector \nblueprint  that  envisages  a  gradual  transition  to  full  competition  by  2010.  The  Government \nremoved  the  respective  monopolies  of  Telkom  and  Indosat,  partially  privatized  them,30 \neliminated \nIndonesian \nTelecommunication Regulatory Body (BRTI). While competition is strong in the profitable mobile \nphone  market,31  Telkom  continues  to  monopolize  the  fixed-line  business,  using  its  dominant \nposition  as  a  provider  of  basic  infrastructure.  Indosat  has  made  little  inroads  in  this  market \nsegment, despite having a license for domestic local and long-distance services. Telkom is also \ndominant in Internet services.32  \n \nH. \n \nAmong the various infrastructure sectors in Indonesia, water supply and sanitation are in \n21. \nthe  worst  technical  and  financial  condition.  Only  about  40  million  people,  or  18%  of  the \npopulation,  are  connected  to  piped  water  supply  from  regional  water  supply  companies \n(PDAMs). Even in urban areas, only 33% of people receive piped water. The remaining urban \npopulation  depends  on  individual  wells,  small-scale  providers,  or  water  vendors,  often  at  high \n\nin  other  operators,  and  established \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation33\n\ntheir  cross-holdings \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n25  The regulatory role within the ministry is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n26  About  4  fixed  lines  per  100  inhabitants,  compared  to  about  4  in  the  Philippines,  5  in  India,  6  in  Viet  Nam,  11  in \n\nThailand, 18 in Malaysia, and more than 20 in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n27  The six largest cities\u2014Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, Medan, and Denpasar\u2014with less than 10% of the \n\ncountry\u2019s population account for almost 50% of all fixed lines.  \n\n28  About  9  mobile  phones  per  100  inhabitants,  which  is  well  above  India  (2)  and  Viet  Nam  (3),  but  distinctly  below \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (22), Philippines (27), Thailand (40), and Malaysia (45). \n\n29  Less than 4 users per 100 inhabitants, compared to about 2 in India, 4 in the Philippines and Viet Nam, 6 in the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, 11 in Thailand, and 34 in Malaysia. \n\n30  The  privatization  started  with  the  listing  of  Telcom  and  Indosat  on  the  New  York  stock  exchange  in  1995  when \nabout 5% of shares were offered to the public. It continued with a few subsequent listings and partial divestments, \nwith the largest transactions undertaken in the banking subsector. \n\n31  Six companies have national licenses, among which Telkomsel is leading with a market share of about 50%. \n32  Of the approximately 190 licensed Internet service providers, some 35 are active.

Only  about  15%  of  rural  households  get \ndrinking  water  from  pipe  or  pump  sources,  with  PDAMs  accounting  for  about  half  of  it.  The \nmajority of rural households still rely on shallow groundwater extraction or rainwater collection, \nor  use  surface  water  from  nearby  rivers  or  springs.  The  poor  are  affected  most  by  this \nunsatisfactory  situation.  Countrywide,  less  than  20%  of  the  poor  have  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater,  compared  to  more  than  80%  of  the  rich.  The  poor  pay  water  vendors  up  to  five  times \nmore than the rich who use piped water.  \n \n22.  Wastewater disposal is almost entirely handled by local governments. Indonesia has one \nof the lowest rates of urban sewerage coverage in Asia. Only seven cities have some form of \nsewerage networks that reach just 10% of urban residents. Over 70% of urban households have \non-site sanitation, mostly in the form of septic tanks that are not functioning effectively. In rural \nareas, less than 30% of households have toilet facilities, and only about 20% septic tanks. The \nlack of adequate sewerage systems, combined with inadequate solid waste management, has \ncaused  widespread  contamination  of  surface  and  groundwater.  These  conditions  explain  the \nhigh incidence of waterborne diseases. Indonesia has the highest incidence of typhoid in East \nAsia, and diarrhea is the second largest cause of death among young children. \n \n23. \nThe  more  than  300  PDAMs  are  under  the  jurisdiction  and  ownership  of  local \ngovernments. The majority are struggling, with their financial situation deteriorating and service \nquality falling. About 70% of the PDAMs are heavily indebted, having on their books more than \n400  outstanding  loans  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  that  need  to  be  restructured;  almost  two \nthirds  are  in  arrears  or  default.34  Tariffs  are  well  below  cost-recovery  levels,  and  often  do  not \neven cover costs for operation and maintenance. The PDAMs function with little autonomy from \nlocal governments, which keep tariffs artificially low and demand dividends that reduce funds for \nmaintenance and investments. Total annual PDAM losses are very high. Averaging about 40%, \nunaccounted  for  water  is  clearly  excessive  and  loss  reduction  programs  have  been  mostly \nunsuccessful.  The  large  number  of  PDAMs  is  a  concern,  because  many  are  too  small  to  be \nsustainable. \n \n24. \nThe  sector  suffers  from  low  investment,  a  situation  aggravated  by  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis.  Particularly  in  sanitation,  investment  has  been  almost  negligible,  and  cost  recovery \nconsidered  irrelevant.  Annual  investments  of  about  $600  million  are  estimated  to  meet  the \nMillennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation.35 The bulk of financing will have \nto come from cash generated by the PDAMs and local government budgets. This calls for major \nimprovements  in  the  self-financing  capacity  of  PDAMs,  and  in  the  borrowing  capacity  and \nfinancial management of local governments. Ensuring access of the latter to long-term finance \nis  particularly  important.  The  gap  between  the  investment  needs  and  public  sources  of  funds, \nincluding foreign borrowing, will have to be closed by sharply increased PSP.36 \n\n                                                \n \n34  The money owed by the PDAMs to MOF totals about Rp5 trillion. \n35  The  target  is:  Halving  by  2015  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and \nsignificantly improving by 2020 the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers through improved sanitation and other \nmeasures. \n\n36  Except  for  three  water  supply  concessions  (two  in  Jakarta  and  one  in  Batam),  PSP  in  the  sector  has  been \n\ninsignificant. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4  \n\n45 \n\n45\n\n \n\nSector \n\n \nLegal Framework \n\n \nRegulatory Framework

Policy from the Government of Indonesia \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n24 October 2006 \nJakarta, Indonesia \n\n \n \nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \nDear Mr. Kuroda:  \n \nI. \n\nIntroduction  \n\n1. \nThe Government of Indonesia (the Government) has now successfully completed almost \ntwo years in office.  With principal focus on accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty \nand regional disparities, the Government has progressed on the reform agenda against a backdrop \nof extraordinary circumstances in 2004-2006. The devastating natural disasters in several areas \nsuch  as  Aceh,  Nias,  Yogyakarta,  Central  and  West  Java  and  South  Sulawesi,  while  posing \nenormous challenges, have not deterred us from moving ahead on national economic priorities. \nIn  parallel,  the  Government  has  also  made  marked  progress  on  the  governance  front,  by \nstrengthening key institutions and considerably enhancing transparency.   \n\n2. \nThe  Indonesian  economy  grew  at  5.6%  in  2005  -  the  best  performance  ever  since  the \ncrisis.  Growth  in  2006,  and  to  some  extent  in  2007,  will  be  conditioned  by  the  Government\u2019s \nbold decision in October 2005 to reduce the escalating fuel subsidies and bring domestic fuel-oil \nprices  closer  to  international  parity.  For  2006,  our  growth  projection  of  5.7-5.9%  hinges  on \naccelerating development spending in the second half of the year. Fiscal consolidation has been \nour  principal  anchor  in  macroeconomic  management,  and  it  will  continue  to  guide  us  in  the \nfuture. However, recognizing that Indonesia lags behind in health and education attainments, and \nin infrastructure access, the Government is poised to scale up public spending in these areas. As \na  result,  we  aim  at  a  higher  deficit  of  1.3%  in  2006  while  for  2007  the  deficit  is  projected  at \n1.1%. A comprehensive community-driven development program is under preparation to scaleup \nthe provision of public services and infrastructure in the regions.    \n  \n3. \nNotwithstanding  the  favorable  macroeconomic  performance,  the  Government  is  acutely \naware that the current levels of economic growth would still not be enough to create sufficient \njob  opportunities,  reduce  employment  and  cut  poverty  levels.  For  the  economy  to  generate  2 \nmillion  new  jobs  every  year  and  to  create  wealth  to  halve  poverty  to  around  8%  by  2010, \nIndonesia  needs  to  grow  at  7-8%  every  year.  Investments  \u2013  particularly  in  infrastructure  \u2013  are \nvital to accelerate growth. Indonesia used to invest upwards of 6% of GDP on infrastructure prior \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nto  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  Now,  with  investments  at  around  2%  of  GDP,  poor \ninfrastructure  is  already  starting  to  constrain  the  pace  of  our  economic  growth  and  impact  the \nquality  of  our  basic  public  services.  Since  the  crisis,  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  support \ninfrastructure development has been limited by budgetary constraints. As a result, we confront a \nsubstantial infrastructure financing gap. Indonesia is now at a critical juncture where we need to \naccelerate  public  spending  on  infrastructure,  as  well  as  to  attract  private  sector  participation \n(PSP). PSP in infrastructure is accordingly an imperative rather than an option.  \n \n4. \nEnhancing  PSP  and  formulating  effective  public  private  partnerships  (PPPs)  in \ninfrastructure  provision  need  wide-ranging  sector  and  cross-sector  reforms.  We  requested  the \ndevelopment partners for support in articulating as well as implementing reforms following the \nJanuary  2005  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit.  Subsequently,  the  Government  adopted  a \ncomprehensive  Infrastructure  Policy  Package  (IPP)  in  February  2006  which  outline  the  key \ninitial  actions  to  be  taken  by  the  line  ministries,  state-owned  enterprises  and  infrastructure \ncontracting agencies in 2006. The IPP benefited from inputs from development partners, under \nADB\u2019s coordination. Based on the work done over the last one-and-half years, a medium-term \nreform  program  has  been  put  together,  as  outlined  in  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (IRSDP).  The  IRSDP  expands  the  agenda  in  the  IPP  to  clearly  outline \nreforms during 2005-2010, as the complex regulatory, institutional and policy changes need time \nand significant consensus building.   \n \n5. \nThis Letter of Development Policy is in support of our request that the ADB approve the \noverall IRSDP cluster comprising three subprograms and a $400 million loan for Subprogram 1 \nto disburse in fiscal year 2006. We have also requested the World Bank and the Government of \nJapan (GOJ) to provide co-financing support for the reforms implemented under Subprogram 1 \nof IRSDP. The Letter should be read in conjunction with the Policy Matrix (Attachment 1), and \ntogether  they  constitute  this  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  commitment  in  infrastructure \nsectors. \n \nII. \n \n\nInfrastructure  Reforms  \u2013  Achievements,  the  Road  Ahead,  and  Our  Vision  and \nCommitment \n\nA. \n\nThe Challenge and Scope of Reforms \n\n6.  \nFocus on Good Governance: Since taking office in October 2004, the Government has \nfocused on ensuring good governance in public administration. We have reforms underway in a \nwide  range  of  areas  with  focus  on  preventing  corruption,  including:  procurement,  public \nfinancial management, internal controls and auditing, and gradual progress towards performance \norientation. In parallel, we have taken significant measures to strengthen our institutions such as \nthe  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK), \nthe  Judicial \nCommission,  among  others.  In  the  infrastructure  sectors  in  particular,  the  Government  is \ncommitted  to  enhancing  governance  along  several  directions  which  includes:  policy,  legal  and \nregulatory  framework;  sector-level  planning  and  implementation;  and  open  and  transparent \nproject transactions. \n\nthe  Anti-Corruption  Court,  and \n\n7.  \nSector  Coverage:  Given  the  need  to  enhance  the  quality  and  quantity  of  infrastructure \nservices  across  the  board,  our  program  \u2013  as  encapsulated  by  the  IRSDP  -  covers  nine \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n49 \n\ninfrastructure  sectors,  including  land  transportation,  toll  roads,  railways,  air  transportation,  sea \ntransportation, power, oil and gas, telecommunications, and water supply and sanitation. Such a \nwide  coverage  means  a  plethora  of  complex  reforms.  We  have  used  the  time  since  the  first \nIndonesia  Infrastructure  Summit  in  January  2005  to  draft  amendments  to  various  laws  and \nregulations,  strengthen  institutional  structures,  and  put  in  place  initial  sector  plans  and  blue \nprints, to pave way for accelerating infrastructure development through public investments and \ngreater PSP. These sector plans will be updated during the course of IRSDP, as well as used a \nbasis by KKPPI for recommending Government support to the Ministry of Finance. A new roads \nlaw was enacted in 2004, and the drafts of new laws on electricity, railways, sea transport and air \ntransport are now being deliberated by Parliament.  \n\nAccess Issues: The lack of investments and the absence of an accommodative framework \n8.  \nover  the  last  decade  have  prevented  Indonesia  from  increasing  access  to  infrastructure.  In \nparticular, we face serious power shortages in some regions and lack of access to adequate and \nclean water supply and sanitation facilities in general across the country. In the power sector, if \nwe  take  \u201celectricity  for  all\u201d  as  the  goal  by  2020,  we  need  to  achieve  about  1  million  new \nconnections  in  rural  areas  every  year.  At  present,  we  are  in  the  200,000-300,000  range  with \nregard  to  rural  electrification.  Only  18%  of  the  country  has  access  to  safe  and  clean  drinking \nwater supply through piped sources. Given the archipelagic nature of the country, inter-island sea \ntransportation  is  very  vital,  but  the  service  coverage  is  inadequate.  Accelerating  economic \ngrowth needs greater access to roads of high quality, an area where we need to construct at least \nabout 1,000 kilometers of new tollroad networks by 2009, not including the other national and \nlocal  level  highways.  Our  line  ministries  are  committed  to  developing  comprehensive  sector \ncoverage strategies - building on the masterplans and blueprints developed - particularly in the \npower,  roads,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectors.  In  particular,  through  the  course  of \nIRSDP, the concerned line ministries and/or agencies have undertaken to: \n\n\u2022  Refine the Government\u2019s electricity access strategy by considering options including the \npotential  contributions  of  user  payments  and  subsidies,  the  role  of  sub-national \ngovernments, and regionally differentiated approaches to electricity access; \n\n\u2022  Refine  water  access  strategy  by:  (i)  setting  targets  based  on  credible  financing \narrangements;  (ii)  addressing  the  relative  roles  of  financing  through  development \nassistance,  domestic  borrowing,  user  tariffs  and  government  subsidy;  (iii)  developing \ncriteria  for  access  by  regional  water  utilities  (PDAMs)  to  government  finance  that \nprovides incentives for enhanced financial performance; and (iv) developing approaches \nfor reducing the level of PDAM debt arrears. \n\n9.  \nAffordability:  The  present  Government  has  been  bold  in  sharply  reducing  the  fuel  oil \nsubsidies in March and October 2005. It has also adopted regulations in some sectors allowing \nfor cost-based tariff setting policies, for instance for water supply and toll roads. Our regulatory \nframework (elaborated below in para.17 below) provides for full cost recovery to enable greater \nPSP. However, the Government will have to balance economic growth considerations vis-\u00e0-vis \nsocial  balance  and  equity.  Our  subsidy  policies are  gradually  moving  towards  more  equity,  by \ntargeting and protecting the poor and charging progressively higher tariffs for those with greater \nability and willingness to pay.  \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPublic  Service  Obligations  (PSO):  As  we  accelerate  infrastructure  development, \n10.  \nequitable access to services is an important issue to address, given the geographic spread and size \nof  the  country.  There  are  significant  PSOs  in  some  sectors.  Several  SOEs  have  mandated  and \nclear  PSOs  that  they  are  obliged  to  fulfill.  In  some  sectors,  subsidized  services  are  delivered \nthrough other modalities (including contracting out to private operators). The basic issue in such \ncases is that services cannot be provided on a full-cost recovery basis. As part of the IRSDP, the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  adopting  a  uniform  and  consistent  PSO  policy  across  all  sectors. \nFurther,  each  sector  ministry  will  also  prepare  a  sector-specific  PSO  policy  and  begin  its \nimplementation  during  the  course  of  IRSDP,  to  ensure  that  the  PSO  obligations  are  delivered. \nFurther,  it  is  our  view  that  PSO  provision  can  also  be  fulfilled  through  greater  PSP,  besides \nincreasing efficiency.  \n\nB. \n\nAccelerating PSP \n\n11.   Basics for Enhancing PSP: While we see the need for PSP, we also acknowledge that it \nwill not be easy to persuade private sector investors to meet it. As in other sectors, we understand \nthat investment decisions are taken on the basis of perceptions of risk and expectations of return. \nAnd, we are aware that risk perceptions are currently deterring many prospective infrastructure \ninvestors  and  lenders,  or  otherwise  causing  them  to  seek  levels  of  return  that  are  socially  and \npolitically  unsustainable.  Thus,  our  ability  to  meet  our  expectations  for  PPPs  in  infrastructure \nprovision will depend in considerable measure on our ability to address risk issues. \n\n12.   We  acknowledge,  at  the  outset,  that  our  initial  high  targets  for  private  infrastructure \ninvestment  have  not  been  met.  On  the  other  hand,  we  do  have  to  stress  that  we  have  learned \nmany  important  lessons  as  a  result,  and  are  now  starting  to  apply  these.  The  Government  has \naccelerated reform of infrastructure sector policies, including by: \n\n\u2022  Establishing more transparent and predictable regulatory regimes; \n\u2022  Eliminating  inappropriate  State-enterprise  \u2018exclusivities\u2019  that  preclude  or  inhibit \n\ncompetition \n\n\u2022  Enabling improved modalities for PPPs \n\n \n13.  \nScope  for  PPPs:  PPPs  are  not  really  new  in  Indonesia.  We  have  opened  our \ninfrastructure activities to the private sector back in the early 1990s. But, not all past experiences \ndealing  with  PPPs  were  considered  a  success  story.  Our  experience  in  the  electricity  sector  is \nobviously one example of bad story. That failure of implementing PPPs has not only created a \nsignificant financial cost to the Government and State Electricity Corporation (PLN) but also has \nundermined our credibility. We do not want repeat those bad experiences and we intend to adopt \nbest practices for the PPP.  \n\n14.   Need for Change Management: Opening the doors to private infrastructure investment \nnecessarily  requires  behavioral  and  cultural  changes  in  the  government  agencies  and  State \nenterprises tasked with project preparation, tendering, negotiation, and implementation oversight. \nWe  recognize  and  acknowledge  that  we  have  previously  underestimated  the  scope  and \ncomplexity of the needed changes. The Government is taking the following actions in order to \nreduce the resistance of the public to PPPs: \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n51 \n\nInvolve stakeholders from the initial stages of PPP projects; \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Clearly show the objective of PPP projects through proper public relations; and \n\u2022  Present and process and adequate number of model projects as showcases of PPPs. \n\n \n15.  \nFoundational  Regulatory  Framework  for  PSP:  Overcoming  the  above  problems  will \nrequire  strong  direction  and  leadership,  both  at  the  political  level  and  within  the  responsible \ninstitutions.  We  have  reactivated  the  National  Committee  on  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (KKPPI) \u2013 as a mechanism for driving and facilitating decision-making. One of the \nearly tasks assigned to KKPPI was to prepare an improved cross-sector regulation on PPPs. As \noutlined in the IRSDP policy matrix, the Government has taken a set of key regulatory measures \nin enhancing PSP. We have adopted Presidential Regulation No.67/2005, that defines the \u2018rules \nof  the  game\u2019  for  PSP  as  well  as  cooperation  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  in \ninfrastructure provision which is in line with international best practice. \n\nC. \n\nDesigning PPPs Effectively \u2013 Need for Project Preparation \n\n16.   We  also  recognize  that  many  of  the  projects  offered  to  the  private  sector  recently,  for \nvarious reasons, have not been prepared to sufficiently  high  standards. In particular,  feasibility \nstudies  and  other  documentation  have  not  provided  adequate  information  for  prospective \ninvestors  on  some  key  risk  areas.  Unfortunately,  time  is  not  on  our  side  here,  and  we  cannot \nafford  to  restart  the  preparation  process  for  all  projects  in  our  current  pipeline.  Rather,  the \nGovernment is now pursuing a two-fold strategy under which we are: \n\n\u2022  Striving  to  improve  the  documentation  of  projects  that  are  already  far  advanced  in \n\n\u2022 \n\npreparation; and, in parallel \nInitiating  the  preparation  of  a  carefully  selected  set  of  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  demonstration \nprojects, which also serve as models for the future. \n\n \n17.  \nProject Preparation: In view of the capacity constraints at national and local levels, the \nGovernment  is  now  establishing  a  Project  Development  Facility  (PDF)  \u2013  included  under  the \nIRSDP  \u2013  to  ensure  that  adequate  funding  is  available  for  the  timely  preparation  of  promising \nprojects to the exacting standards expected by prospective investors and lenders. The PDF will \nhelp develop the Government\u2019s own capacity, while at the same time building a robust pipeline \nof PPP projects. BAPPENAS is in the process of establishing a PPP Central Unit to coordinate \nthe implementation of the overall PPP framework. The PDF will be an integral part of the PPP \nCentral Unit, and its activities will be fully coordinated with that of the Unit.  \n\nD. \n\nAccelerating PPPs \u2013 Need for Model PPP Transactions \n\n18.  \nTranslating the good policy, legal and regulatory measures accomplished over 2004-2006 \ninto  improvements  in  infrastructure  access  calls  for  actual  project  transactions.  At  the  first \nIndonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005, the Government announced a catalogue of 91 \nprojects  in  the  various  sectors.  We  have  made  some  progress  in  the  interim,  with  about  20 \nprojects  in  the  power  and  toll  road  sectors  in  particular  going  through  the  pre-qualification  or \nbidding stages.  A few projects  have  been  awarded  in the gas, power and water  supply  sectors. \nEfforts are underway at present to achieve financial closure. Far more needs to be done.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n19.   As  part  of  the  IRSDP,  the  Government  has  identified  several  candidate  Model  PPP \nProjects,  which  are  presented  in  Table  1  at  the  end  of  this  letter.  The  Government  will  table \ndetailed information memoranda on as many of these projects as possible at the November 2006 \nInfrastructure  Conference  and  Exhibition.  These  Model  PPP  Projects  will  fully  comply  with \nPerpres  No.67/2005  and  MOF  Decree  No.38/2006.  Their  preparation  will  be  supported  by  the \nPDF  or  other  available  sources.  In  parallel,  as  part  of  the  preparatory  process,  the  KKPPI  and \nMOF will work together with the line ministry or contracting agency concerned in determining \nthe  type  and  level  of  Government  risk-sharing  support  for  the  projects.  Once  this  decision  is \ntaken, then the PDF or other sources will help in the bidding and transaction execution process. \nOur goal is that as many of the Model PPP Projects as possible would have reached the bidding \nstage during the course of 2007. We will also initiate preparatory work for a subsequent set of \nPPP projects to be pursued over 2007-2010. We need to adopt a gradual approach in executing \nsuch  projects.  Our  line  ministries  also  need  to  build  consensus  and,  where  applicable,  to \nconvince  the  concerned  SOE  to  adopt  the  best  possible  approach  from  the  country\u2019s  point  of \nview. But, we remain confident that a number of good PPP projects will be identified, prepared \nand implemented during the course of IRSDP.  \n\nE. \n \n\nAccelerating  Infrastructure  Development  through  PPPs  \u2013  Need  for  Prudent  Risk-\nSharing Arrangements \n\n20.   Risk-Sharing Framework: The Perpres No.67/2005 framework is supplemented by the \nMinister  of  Finance  Regulation  No.38/2006  on  Implementing  Control  and  Management  of \nInfrastructure  Provision  Risks.  This  regulation  highlights  the  need  for  the  risk  management \nprocess  to  support  the  provision  of  infrastructure  so  as  to  enable  more  rapid  economic  growth \nwhile ensuring fiscal sustainability. Among others, it defines: \n\n\u2022  The types of risk that the Government is willing to bear or share, namely certain types of \n\npolitical, project performance, and demand risks; \n\n\u2022  The types of Government contingent support that can be considered, and the criteria to be \n\nused in deciding the form and amount of Government support; \n\n\u2022  The procedures to be followed in evaluating and responding to requests for Government \n\nsupport, including making the needed budgetary provision; and \n\n\u2022  The requirements for monitoring and reporting on the evolution of project risks.   \n\n \n21.  \nInitial  Allocation  of  Resources  for  Risk  Sharing:  To  help  implement  the  risk \nmanagement framework effectively, a Risk Management Center (RMC) has been established in \nMOF.  In  order  to  help  operationalize  the  framework,  the  Government  has  proposed  that  about \nRp.2.5  trillion  be  set  aside  in  the  2006  and  2007  budgets  for  risk-sharing  support.  Subject  to \nneeds, it is envisaged that adequate resources can be allocated in the 2007 supplementary budget, \nand 2008 and 2009 budgets. In the initial stages, tentatively July 2006-June 2007, the RMC will \nfunction with the help of consultants while at the same time building the capacity of MOF staff \nin risk assessments. The RMC will become operational with a full complement of qualified staff \nfrom mid-2007 onwards. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements for Determining Risk Sharing Support: The Government \n22.  \nis  close  to  finalizing  a  Government  Regulation  on  Investment  Funds  under  the  Treasury  Law \n(Law No.1/2004). This is expected to be completed and endorsed by the President before the end \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n53 \n\nof  2006.  In  parallel,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  working  with  the  ADB  and  World  Bank  on \nestablishing  a  Guarantee  Fund  by  June  2007.  The  Rp.2.5  trillion  that  has  been  tentatively  set \naside from the State Budget for risk-sharing purposes will be held in the Guarantee Fund, as the \nGovernment\u2019s initial contribution. In addition, we have also requested the development partners \nto support the strengthening of the Guarantee Fund through their partial credit guarantee or risk \nmanagement products. In order to ensure good governance, particularly to adhere to the highest \nprinciples  of  fairness  and  transparency,  the  Guarantee  Fund  shall  be  used  only  for  those  PPP \nprojects  that  fully  comply  with  all  the  provisions  of  Perpres  No.67/2005  and  MOF  Decree \nNo.38/2006.  \n\n23.   Overarching  Focus  on  Good  Governance  in  Determining  Risk-Sharing:  At  the \noutset, the principles that underlie our policy on risk sharing are as follows:  \n\n\u2022  Some Government support is necessary and should be given in accordance with the risk \n\n\u2022  Risk must be allocated to the party that is best able to manage it; and \n\u2022  The level of Government support will be gradually reduced along with improvements in \n\nsharing framework; \n\ninvestment climate. \n\n \n24.   With limited resources available and the past mixed history of Government support, it is \ncritical that we adhere to strict good governance norms. One such principle is transparency, and \nMOF  has  been  strictly  adhering  to  this.  For  purposes  of  determining  Government  support,  we \nhave categorized projects into three types: \n\n\u2022  Category  1:  Projects  to  be  Directly  Executed  by  the  Government  or  Contracting \nAgencies:  Given  the  urgent  need  to  expand  the  provision  of  infrastructure  services,  the \nGovernment  plans  to  design  and  execute  infrastructure  projects  with  public  sector \nresources  (including  foreign  loans  guaranteed  by  the  Government).  An  example  is  the \n10,000 MW crash program for electricity generation. This program will be executed by \nPLN.  There  may  be  other  programs  or  projects  of  this  nature  emerging  in  the  future, \nwherein our goal will be to enhance infrastructure provision.  \n\n\u2022  Category 2: PPP Projects (Awarded through Bidding) or Other Projects (Awarded \nthrough Direct Selection) prior to Perpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006: \nFor this category we will apply all the relevant provisions of our regulatory framework in \ndetermining Government support. If the proposed projects do not meet the requirements \nof Perpres No.67/2005 and MOF Decree No.38/2006, then we will apply the principles of \ntransparency,  accountability,  proper  risk  allocation  and  sharing,  and  fiscal  prudence  in \ndetermining  fiscal  support  for  such  projects  through  the  general  budget  allocation \nprocess.  \n\n \n\u2022  Category  3:  PPP  Projects  Prepared  and  Awarded  on  the  Basis  of  Perpres \nNo.67/2005  and  MOF  Decree  No.38/2006:  Our  commitment  is  that  this  is  the  only \ncategory  of  projects  -  which  also  includes  the  Model  PPP  Projects  (see  para.20  above) \npursued  through  IRSDP  or  other  initiatives  \u2013  that  will  be  supported  through  the \nGuarantee  Fund,  subject  to  the  needs  and  all  the  criteria  being  fully  met  in  a  fully \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsatisfactory  manner.  Some  projects  may  also  be  supported  through  the  general  budget \nallocation process, if the needs so warrant. \n\n25. Need for Transparency: In determining Government support, our foremost aim is to adhere \nstrictly to the principles of good governance, anchored on transparency and fiscal prudence. At \nthe  same  time,  the  Government  needs  to  adopt  a  pragmatic  approach,  as  this  is  the  first  time \nsince the financial crisis that the Government is attempting to deal in a systematic manner with \npublic  support  for  large  scale  infrastructure  projects.  Nonetheless,  from  an  overall  resource \nallocation  point  of  view,  we  will  adhere  to  a  key  underlying  principle  that  the  Category  3 \nprojects should not be crowded out by support for the other categories. The Government is also \naware of the importance of open competitive selection processes and of the need for Cooperation \nAgreements to align with accepted international practices, including in particular in the area of \nrisk  allocation  and  sharing.  With  this  in  the  background,  we  have  been  working  to  develop \nimproved model agreements in sectors such as toll roads, power, ports, airports, railways, water, \nand gas pipelines. \n\nF. \n\nOther Essential Reforms in Attracting and Implementing PPPs \n\n26.   Leveling the Playing Field: Our vision is to achieve clarity of institutional roles in the \nprovision of key infrastructure services, including through assigning responsibilities for policy-\nmaking,  contracting,  operational,  and  regulatory  functions  to  separate  agencies.  As  each \nperforms specific tasks, there should not be any conflict of interest in their roles. There already is \nsome  degree  of  separation  between  the  four  functions  in  particular  in  the  toll  roads, \ntelecommunications,  gas  and  water  supply  sectors.  Over  the  course  of  the  IRSDP,  the \nGovernment will continue the gradual separation of the four functions to eliminate any conflicts \nof interest and level the playing field. Though our vision is clear, the progress will be subject to \nthe relevant laws being adopted by Parliament, which is beyond the executive\u2019s authority. \n\n27.   Addressing  Social  Safeguards:  It  is  not  an  easy  challenge  to  balance  the  need  to \naccelerate large-scale infrastructure investments, and the need to maintain acceptable minimum \nsocial  safeguards.  In  Indonesia,  like  in  any  other  country,  the  issue  of  land  acquisition  is  a \ncomplex subject. In 2005, Presidential Regulation No.36/2005 was adopted to replace the earlier \n1993  decree  on  land  acquisition  for  public  purpose.  Subsequently,  with  a  view  to  accelerating \ninfrastructure  investments,  we  have  further  amended  the  regulatory  framework  through \nPresidential Regulation No.65/2006. Together, we are confident that these two regulations will \nsatisfactorily  resolve  most  of  the  residual  problems.  In  particular,  we  believe  this  regulatory \nframework is a significant improvement over the previous set of regulations.  Once it comes into \neffect,  land  acquisition  for  public  purposes  will  be  more  transparent  and  expeditious.  Through \nthe IRSDP, we also commit to reducing the gaps between the Indonesian legal framework and \nthe policies of external financing partners. \n\nto \n28.   Addressing  Environmental  Considerations:  As \naccelerate infrastructure development after the crisis, the Government is cognizant of the need \nfor  stronger  environmental  protection  policies  and  more  effective  implementation.  We  have \nalready  taken  steps  to  improve  the  overall  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental \nmanagement and are committed to enabling provision of adequate resources for AMDAL units \nat various levels of  \n\nIndonesia  moves \n\nforward \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable 1: List of Candidate Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects \nto be Pursued as Model PPPs \n \n\nProject \n\nKey Features \n\nLine Ministry/Contracting Agency\n\nInvestment\n($ million) \n\n2X600 MW \n\n1X500 MW \n\n1,200.0 MEMR/ PLN \n\n275.0 MEMR/PLN \n\n60 kilometers \n\n142.0 MPW/BPJT \n\n165 kilometers \n\n928.0 BPJT \n\nCentral  Java  Coal  Fired  Power \nPlant  \nPasuruan Combined Cycle \nPower Plant \nMedan-Kuala Namu-Tebing \nTinggi Toll Road Project  \nSolo-Kertosono Toll Road \nProject  \nMargagiri-Ketapang Ferry \nTerminal \nTeluk Lamong Seaport (Tanjung \nPerak Port Expansion) \nBandung Water Supply Project \n\n1.2 million \npassengers/annum \n1,280 meter berth \ncontainer terminal  \n450 liters/second \n\n26.0 Bandung Local Government/ BPP \n\nDumai Water Supply Project \n\n500 liters/second \n\n44.0 Dumai Local Government/BPP \n\nTangerang Water Supply Project   550 liters/second \n\n37.0 Tangerang Local Government/BPP \n\nNational Telecommunications \nBackbone Project \nTotal \n\n30,000 kilometers of \nfiber optic network \n \n\nInformatics \n\n4,524.0  \n\n1,500.0*  Ministry of Communications and \n\n \nBPJT  -  Indonesian  Toll  Road  Authority;  BPP  SPAM  -  National  Water  Regulatory  Agency;  MEMR  - \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources; MOT - Ministry of Transport; MPW - Ministry of Public Works; \nPLN - State Electricity Corporation \n\n \n* - An alternative proposal has also been prepared focusing on creating a backbone network only for the \nEastern parts of Indonesia at a cost of $315 million. \n \n \n\n97.0 MOT \n\n275.0 MOT \n\nSPAM \n\nSPAM \n\nSPAM \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n57 \n\nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM1 \n\n \n\nAction \n\nOutput/Milestone \n\nSP1 \n\nSP2 \n\nSP3 \n\nI.

Following the significant hike \nin interest  rates  and fuel price increases in the  fall  of  2005,  real  GDP  growth  slowed  to  under  5 \npercent in the last quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 (y/y). However, growth picked up to \n5.2  percent  (y/y)  in  the  second  quarter,  mainly  reflecting  strong  external  demand  and  some \nacceleration in public consumption. Though still weak, private consumption appears to be picking \nup,  indicating  that  the  adjustment  to  the  domestic  fuel  price  hike  last  fall  is  nearly  complete. \nNevertheless,  unemployment  is  edging  up  and  poverty  rates  remain  high.  Growth  is  expected  to \npick up gradually over the course of 2006 and in 2007, with IMF staff projecting annual growth to \nreach 5.2 percent and 6 percent, respectively, as interest rates are reduced. Nevertheless, there are \nrisks  to  this  outlook,  most  importantly  a  weakening  of  the  international  environment  and  slow \nimplementation of structural reforms.  \n\nInflationary pressures have been declining. Headline inflation declined to 14.6 percent (y/y) in \nSeptember, from 17.1 percent at end-2005, reflecting weak activity and some appreciation of the \nrupiah. Meanwhile, three-month annualized inflation (both headline and core) has remained below \n6  percent  since  the  beginning  of  the year.  On  current  trends,  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  (BI\u2019s)  end-year \ntarget of 7\u20139 percent for headline inflation is well within reach.  \n\nThe overall banking sector continues to perform reasonably well. Partly due to reclassification, \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  increased  substantially  in  2005,  especially  at  the  two  largest  state \nbanks,  but  the  rise  in  NPLs  moderated  in  January\u2013June  2006.  The  sharp  deceleration  in  credit \ngrowth in 2006, as a result of high interest rates and weak demand, will to some extent undermine \nbank  profitability,  but  the  expected  reduction  in  interest  rates  should  prevent  excessive  adverse \neffects on banks. Capital adequacy ratios remain at over 20 percent. \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities  continue  to  be  reduced.  The  current  account  is  expected  to  remain  in \nsurplus in 2006. Foreign exchange reserves, at about $39 billion after the repayment of remaining \ndebt to the Fund of $3\u00bc billion on October 12, are equivalent to about 130 percent of short-term \ndebt. The current account is expected to move into small deficit over the medium term as imports \nrise  faster  than  exports,  financed  in  large  part  by  private  sector  capital  inflows.  The  ratio  of \nexternal  debt  to  GDP  is  expected  to  be  reduced  to  below  25 percent  of  GDP  in  2011,  from  48 \npercent  of  GDP  in  2005.  Nevertheless,  the  market  volatility  experienced  in  May/June  2006  is  a \nreminder  that  Indonesia  remains  susceptible  to  adverse  developments  in  international  capital \nmarkets. \n\nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \n\nThe budgeted policy stance is broadly appropriate. The fiscal deficit targets of 1.3 percent of \nGDP for 2006 and 0.9 percent of GDP for 2007, as outlined in the President\u2019s budget speech in \n\n \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nmid-August, are appropriately geared to further reducing the debt burden, to below 30 percent in \n2010  (compared  with  47  percent  at  end  2005),  while  supporting  activity  in  2006.  After \nconsiderable under spending in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, budget execution improved in \nthe second quarter of 2006. \n\nMonetary  policy  continues  to  be  geared  to  reducing  inflation.  BI\u2019s  gradual  approach  to \nreducing  its  policy  rate  has  helped  contain  inflationary  pressures  and  increase  foreign  exchange \nreserves. There should be room for further gradual rate cuts given the benign inflation outlook and \nstill  large  differential  with  U.S.  interest  rates,  though  the  authorities  need  to  be  careful  that \nexcessive  rate decreases do not  undermine their credibility and prospects for achieving the 2007 \ninflation  target  of  5\u20137  percent.  The  clarity  and  consistency  of  statements  by  BI  officials  in \nsignaling  the  central  bank\u2019s  policy  intentions,  within  the  inflation  targeting  framework,  has \nimproved and is essential to maintaining credibility.  \n\nSteps are being taken to deal with NPLs at state banks. The recently signed Presidential decree \nallowing  state  banks  to  provide  haircuts  on  loans,  together  with  stepped-up  efforts  to  enforce \ncollections, should help to resolve the NPL problem, and avoid erosion of bank capital. IMF staff \ncontinue  to  advise  that  medium-term  strategies  be  adopted  for  the  state  banks,  which  should \ninvolve privatizing those that do not have a clear public policy objective. As regards private banks, \nsupervisors will need to remain vigilant to enforce regulations, and to monitor any deterioration in \ncredit quality.  \n\nThe government is proceeding on a broad range of fiscal reforms. Adoption of the tax package \nnow  before  Parliament,  along  the  lines  endorsed  by  the  business  community,  as  well  as \nmodernization of the tax department, will help enhance revenue collection while restoring investor \nconfidence.  The  government\u2019s  intention  to  better  manage  potential  risks  stemming  from  the \noperations of public enterprises and private-public partnerships is welcome. \n\nTo  improve  the  business  climate  and  boost  growth,  the  government  has  prepared  an \nimpressive  reform  agenda.  Given  the  business  community\u2019s  concerns  about  implementation, \nsome major early reform successes are needed to increase confidence that the entire package will \nbe  implemented.  The  government\u2019s  efforts  to  secure  early  approval  of  customs,  investment,  and \ntax laws are welcome, which apart from the signaling effect would also bring immediate benefits \nfor trade and investment. \n\nFund  staff  recognizes  the  difficulties  of  amending  labor  legislation.  Staff  supports  the \nauthorities\u2019  intention  to  press  ahead  with  the  introduction  of  regulations  that  ensure  a  balanced \nframework for labor-business relations. The new regulations need to protect the rights of workers, \nwhile enhancing flexibility for business, in particular with regard to severance pay and outsourcing \nrequirements. More flexible labor markets will help Indonesia become more competitive vis-\u00e0-vis \nneighboring countries and should encourage employers to make hiring decisions more freely. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n73 \n\nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  Extended  Arrangement  with  the  Fund  expired  in  December  2003.  It  was  \nfollowed by a close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program monitoring \n(PPM) (until the recent repayment of all obligations to the Fund) and extensive technical \nassistance activities.  \n\n\u2022  The 2006 Article IV consultation and fifth PPM were completed on July 31. \n\n\u2022  The next Fund mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions \nfrom the Fiscal Affairs Department and the Monetary and Capital Markets Department will \nbe in the field during November. \n\n\u2022  The  Fund  welcomes  Indonesia's  early  repayment  of  its  obligations  to  the  Fund.  This  is  a \nreflection of the strength of the economy and especially, its balance of payments position. \nThe  Fund  expects  to  continue  a  constructive  dialogue  with  the  Indonesian  authorities \nthrough regular staff visits, technical assistance missions, and in the context of the annual \nArticle IV consultations, the next of which is scheduled for mid-2007. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the foreign currency expenditures for the \n\n1. \nreasonable cost of imported goods required during program implementation.  \n \n2. \n \n\nNotwithstanding the provision of para. 1, no withdrawals will be made for  \n\n(i) \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  standard  International  Trading \nCommodity chapters or headings: \n\nGroup \n\nSubgroup \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A6: Negative List \n\n \n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n718 \n\n897 \n\n971 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n718.7 \n\n897.3 \n\n \nAlcoholic beverages  \nTobacco, unmanufactured tobacco refuse \nTobacco,  manufactured  (whether  or  not  containing  tobacco \nsubstitutes) \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \nNuclear  reactors  and  parts  thereof,  fuel  elements  (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \nJewelry  of  gold,  silver,  or  platinum  group  metals  (except \nwatches  and  watch  cases);  goldsmiths\u2019  or  silversmiths\u2019  wares \n(including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ores and concentrates) \n\nexpenditures in the currency of the Borrower or of goods supplied from the territory \nof the Borrower; \n\npayments  made  for  expenditures  incurred  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness date of the loan; \n\nexpenditures for goods supplied under a contract that any national or international \nfinancing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  agreed  to  finance,  including \nany contract financed under any loans from the Asian Development Bank; \n\n(v) \n\nexpenditures for goods intended for a military or paramilitary purpose or for luxury \nconsumption;  \n\n(vi) \n\nexpenditures for narcotics; and  \n\n(vii) \n\nexpenditures \nfor  pesticides  categorized  as  extremely  hazardous  or  highly \nhazardous  in  class  1a  or  1b,  respectively,  of  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \nClassification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n75 \n\n \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES \n \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nThe lack of adequate preparation of public-private partnership (PPP) projects is one of the \n1. \nmost critical impediments affecting infrastructure development in Indonesia. While more than 90 \nprojects were offered to the private sector at the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005, \nthe  progress  in  actually  implementing  these  projects  has  been  disappointing.  For  example,  no \nmore  than  six  potential  investors  showed  interest  in  any  of  the  toll-road  projects  announced  for \nprequalification;  frequently  the  number  has  been  between  zero  and  two.  The  absence  of \nadequate  and  reliable  technical  and  financial  information  on  PPP  projects,  particularly  any \ndetailed analysis of the various risks affecting them, has been the main reason for this low interest \nand  contributed  to  the  Government\u2019s  unwillingness  to  provide  any  risk-sharing  support.  Without \nthe possibility of such support, reputable investors, especially international, continue to stay away.  \n \n2. \nWith recent enhancements to the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework introduced \nwithin the broader context of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Infrastructure Reform \nSector  Development  Program,  a  more  supportive  environment  for  effective  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  development  has  been  created.  It  is  in  particular  the  Presidential \nRegulation  (Perpres)  67/2005  on  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Provision  that \nprovides  greater  certainty  to  private  investors  by  clearly  defining  the  rules  and  regulations. \nHowever,  large-scale  private  sector  participation  will  remain  constrained  in  the  absence  of \ncomprehensive and reliable information on PPP projects, and a clear attribution of project risks to \nparties that are most suitable to manage them. The Government\u2019s risk management framework, \nas outlined in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Decree 38/2006, deals with the latter. To address the \nlack  of  adequate  project  preparation,  which  also  hampers  effective  risk  allocation,  the \nGovernment  asked  ADB  to  support  the  establishment  of  an  infrastructure  project  development \nfacility (PDF).1 The proposed Project has three components: \n \n\n(i) \n\nPPP project preparation and transaction execution, which includes developing  \n\n \n\n(a)  a  national  component  of  the  PDF  (NPDF)  to  fund  the  preparation  and \nbidding of large projects, mostly in power, toll-road and transport sectors; \nand  \n\n(b)  a  regional  component  of  the  PDF  (RPDF)  to  fund  the  preparation  and \n\nbidding of smaller decentralized regional infrastructure projects.2  \n\ntechnical  advisory  services  to  the  PDF  and  capacity  building  for  PPP  project \npromotion and execution; and \n\nprocurement and administrative services to the PDF.  \n\n                                                 \n1   The PDF will help address one of the most critical constraints. This needs to be supplemented by an effective \nenforcement  of  Perpres  67/2005  and  other  relevant  regulations  to  create  equal  access  for  the  private \nsector,  and  enhance  judicial  certainty  and  adherence  to  arbitration  awards  or  outcomes  of  dispute \nresolution mechanisms. \n\n2   The  Government\u2019s  request  for  support  dates  back  to  2001.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the \nprivate sector  participation development facility  was implemented from  September 2002 to June 2003, the TA loan \nfact-finding and appraisal missions concluded their work in mid-2005, and all other steps were completed by October \n2005 in preparation for loan negotiations. However, in June 2006, the Government requested that the facility\u2019s focus, \nscope, and support be expanded to include the NPDF as well, and that the name of the facility be changed to \u201cRPDF\u201d \nto reflect the focus on regional decentralized projects, with the NPDF dedicated to national projects.   \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nPerpres  67/2005  provides  the  legal  framework  for  all  projects\u2014those  that  are  the \n3. \nresponsibility  of  the  national  Government,  contracting  agencies,  and  local  governments.  Hence, \nthe PDF will integrate the oversight, technical advisory, and procurement functions for national as \nwell as regional projects, which will result in efficiency gains and conserve resources. Based on \nthe Government\u2019s request, ADB proposes providing a loan of $30 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  of \n$7.5 million, while the Government of Indonesia and concerned local governments will contribute \nthe remaining $7.8 million of the total cost of the PDF. \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Description  \n\n1. \n\nPPP Project Preparation and Transaction Execution \n\na. \n\nNPDF \n\n \n \n4. \nObjective and Scope. The principal objective of the NPDF is to accelerate national PPP \nproject  transactions.  In  line  with  Perpres  67/2005,  the  NPDF  will  provide  funding  for  project \npreparation  and  transaction  execution,  leading  to  the  conclusion  of  an  appropriate  contractual \narrangement for the project (i.e., PPP procurement).3 The subsequent project implementation will \nnot be financed from the NPDF. The NPDF will cover large national projects, with specific focus \non  the  power,  toll-road  and  selected  transport  subsectors.  The  extent  of  local  government \ninvolvement in these projects will be limited in comparison with the RPDF. Given the relatively low \naccess  to  infrastructure  services  in  Indonesia,  particularly  of  the  poor,  the  NPDF  will  help  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  efforts  by  accelerating  necessary  investments  and  encouraging \nprivate  sector  participation,  which  in  turn  will  have  longer  term  multiplier  effects  on  poverty \nreduction.  Further,  the  NPDF  will  alleviate  acute  capacity  constraints  within  line  ministries  and \ncontracting agencies in preparing projects and selecting private sector partners.    \n \n5. \n \n\nFunctions. The key functions of the NPDF include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nproviding  support  to  the  National  Committee  on  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (KKPPI) in evaluating potential PPP projects based on an objective \nidentification, screening, and prioritization system; \nenhancing  awareness  of  the  private  sector  about  PPP  projects  to  solicit  interest, \nestablish  contacts  with  potential  private  project  partners,  and  share  information \nwith  them,  with  the  view  to  reducing  the  cost  of  infrastructure  services  through \ngreater competition; \ncontracting  out  consulting  and  PPP  transaction  advisory  services  in  an  open, \ntransparent,  and  competitive  manner  that  is  fully  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement regulations;4 \noverseeing  the  preparation  of  prefeasibility  studies,  preliminary  design,  and \nspecifications for PPP projects;  \nproviding support for the PPP procurement process, including all aspects such as \nbidding, negotiation, and contract award; and \n\n                                                 \n3   PPP  procurement  includes  prequalification,  bidding,  negotiation,  and  signing  of  the  concession  agreement  with  the \nprivate  sector  partner  (or  other  contractual  arrangements  such  as  management,  leasing,  and  build-own-operate \ncontracts).  \n\n4   Presidential Decree 80/2003 on Public Procurement. The provisions of the decree, drafted under an ADB technical \nassistance, are in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Decree requires the establishment of a \nprocurement committee, which may comprise members from different line ministries and/or agencies to ensure good \ngovernance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n77 \n\n \n\ndesigning  a  sustainable  cost-recovery  scheme  to  ensure  that  the  project \npreparatory  and  transaction  execution  resources  invested  through  the  NPDF  are \nrecouped  through  the  PPP  contractual  agreements,  and  that  a  legally  sound \ninstitutional  and  operational  system  is  established  for  the  NPDF  and  government \nbudget  system  to  reuse  the  recovered  resources  for  the  preparation  and \ntransaction execution of a continuing pipeline of projects. \n\n \nRole. Project preparation and transaction advisory support will include  \n\n6. \n \n\nrefining  and  strengthening  PPP  project  proposals,  and  preparing  a  project \nsummary and business plan (information memorandum) aimed at attracting private \nsector interest;  \nidentifying sources of technical services that can help prepare quality projects; \nundertaking  a  thorough  prefeasibility  study  in  line  with  Perpres  67/2005  that \nincludes \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n  \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n(f) \n\n(g) \n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n\npreliminary technical design and specifications; \nanalysis  of  PPP  options  leading  to  the  optimum  institutional  structure  to \nachieve  financial  closing,  and  to  ensure  successful  project  construction, \nmanagement, and operation; \na comprehensive economic analysis; \na comprehensive financial analysis, including tariff analysis and testing for \nproject robustness; \ndetailed cost estimates and a financing plan;  \ndesign  of  a  sound  fiduciary  management  structure  for  the  project  that \npromotes transparency between the public and private partners in the PPP \ntransaction; \na comprehensive procurement plan;  \na  social  and  environmental  impact  analysis,  including  poverty,  land \nacquisition, resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environment; and \nassessment of any labor-related concerns or issues, particularly in the case \nof nongreenfield projects; and  \n\nproviding transaction execution services for PPP procurement including \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n(a) \n\ndrafting or refining prequalification and bidding documents, and concession \nagreements  (or  other  contractual  arrangements  [footnote 3]),  which  cover, \namong others, construction, input supply, output purchase, general project \nmanagement, and management and turnover of assets; \nprequalifying bidders; \nevaluating technical and financial proposals from prequalified bidders;  \nensuring  that  principles  and  modalities  are  specified  in  the  concession \nagreement  for  arbitration  or  other  forms  of  dispute  resolution  that  are \napplicable within relevant laws to resolve any conflicts or disputes that may \narise between the contracting authority and the winning bidder; and \nundertaking  negotiations  with  the  preferred  bidder  and  finalizing  the \nconcession agreement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nStructure and Process. The NPDF will initially be established, together with the  RPDF, \n7. \nas an advisory facility within the Government.5 Figure A8 presents the various steps involved in \nproject  identification,  prioritization,  selection,  preparation,  and  transaction  execution;  and  shows \nhow the NPDF and RPDF are integrally involved in the process. The steps provide for adequate \nchecks  and  balances  to  ensure  that  BAPPENAS  (the  National  Development  Planning  Agency), \nthe  Executing  Agency,  as  well  as  the  concerned  implementing  agencies  adhere  to  good \ngovernance principles in all aspects related to the PDF, including transparent decision-making on \nrequests  for  funding  from  the  NPDF  and  RPDF;  procurement  of  advisory,  consulting,  and \ntransaction-execution services; and oversight of the project preparation and transaction execution \nprocesses.  The  table  at  the  end  of  this  appendix  (Table  A8.4)  presents  a  checklist  of  the \nregulatory requirements for PPP projects. Once the decision is taken to provide preparatory and \ntransaction execution support from the national or regional component of the PDF, the checklist in \nTable A8.4 will form the basis for determining the level and scope of such support, as well as for \nthe subsequent decision-making on the PPP project by the KKPPI and MOF. \n \n8. \nProject Pipeline and Selection. The KKPPI Secretariat maintains and regularly updates \na  database  on  PPP  project  opportunities  in  the  various  infrastructure  sectors,  which  represents \nthe  potential  project  pipeline  for  the  NPDF.  In  the  July  2006  update,  75  national  projects  were \nlisted. About half were still at the preparation and prequalification stages, and hence suitable for \nNPDF funding. The other projects have already reached the bidding or contract award stage, but \nquestions  on  how  many  of  these  will  actually  materialize  are  being  raised.  The  bidding  was \nfrequently based on inadequate information such as outdated prefeasibility studies (or no studies \nat all), and the Government did not offer any risk sharing. For such failed projects, rebidding may \nbe  needed  after  the  project  information,  including  risk  analysis,  has  been  improved,  preferably \nwith the help of the NPDF.  \n \n9. \nThe power and toll-road sectors account for more than 70% of the country\u2019s infrastructure \nneeds.  Yet,  these  are  also  the  sectors  where  project  preparation  has  not  been  given  adequate \nresources. The NPDF is expected to finance the preparation and transaction execution for at least \n10 power, toll-road, as well as selected transport sector projects. The first two projects, preferably \none  each  for  power  and  toll-roads,  will  be  processed  for  the  NPDF  on  a  model  basis.  Lessons \nfrom other PPP projects prepared and executed outside the NPDF will be reviewed to refine the \nmodels. Parallel to that, a cost-recovery scheme may be formulated and adopted through which \nthe  Government  recoups  at  least  part  of  the  preparatory  and  execution  costs  from  project \nsponsors. Subject to the success of the cost-recovery scheme, the number of projects financed \nby the NPDF may be higher.  \n \n10. \nAs  shown  in  Figure  A8,  the  line  ministries  or  contracting  agencies  will  prioritize  their \nprojects for funding under the NPDF. In doing so, they will use the prioritization criteria specified \nin the Government\u2019s Operational Guidelines Manual on the application of Perpres 67/2005. Given \nthe  limited  resources  available,  BAPPENAS  will  have  to  undertake  the  subsequent  ranking  and \nselection of projects for the NPDF in an objective and systematic manner, taking into account the \nfollowing:  (i)  inclusion  of  the  proposed  project  in  the  concerned  ministry  or  contracting  agency\u2019s \nmaster  plan  and  in  the  KKPPI  database;  (ii)  quality  of  the  demand  forecast  or  other  studies \nindicating the need for the project; (iii) a rapid preliminary assessment of the technical, economic, \nand  financial  prospects  of  the  project  vis-\u00e0-vis  other  candidates;  (iv)  private  sector  interest, \nincluding an assessment of the project\u2019s prospects, vis-\u00e0-vis other candidates, for attracting wide \n\n                                                 \n5   Law 1/2004 on the State Treasury allows the Government to establish Badan Layanan Umum or s that can act on \nbehalf of the Government. The possibility of adopting a general service agency status for the PDF will be reviewed as \npart of the technical advisory services and capacity-building component.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n79 \n\n \n\ninternational private sector participation if a comprehensive prefeasibility study is prepared using \nNPDF  resources;  (v)  completion  of  all  necessary  initial  steps  in  line  with  Perpres  67/2005, \nincluding  public  notification;  (vi)  submission  by  the  line  ministry  or  contracting  agency  of  a \ncomprehensive  proposal  request  for  consulting  services  for  project  preparation  and  transaction \nexecution,  with  a  written  and  binding  commitment  that  they  have  complied  with  all  applicable \nnational  laws,  regulations,  and  policies;  and  all  relevant  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements;  (vii)  resource  requirements  for  the  consulting  services,  availability  of  counterpart \nsupport, and commitment from the line ministry/contracting agency to provide such support; (viii) \nprospects  for  meeting  initial  public  investment  requirements  for  project  implementation,  such  as \nland acquisition; and (ix) the need for Government risk-sharing support for project implementation \nand/or  operation.  These  project  selection  criteria  will  be  refined  under  the  technical  advisory \nservices and capacity-building component. \n \n\nb. \n\nRPDF \n\n \n\n11. \nObjective. The RPDF is to support local governments in preparing decentralized regional \ninfrastructure  PPP  projects  effectively  to  increase  private  sector  participation.  The  impact  of  the \nRPDF  will  be  improved  regional  living  conditions  and  economic  development  through  local \ninfrastructure  development.  The  outcome  will  be  to  (i)  increase  private  sector  participation  in \nregional infrastructure projects by enabling local governments to prepare bankable PPP projects, \nand (ii) disseminate and catalyze best practice in structuring and executing PPP transactions. The \nresulting projects will be ready for financing and implementation. They will also generate business \nand employment opportunities for a wide range of private sector participants across Indonesia. \n \nScope  and  Function.  The  demand  assessment  for  the  RPDF  is  based  on  72  projects \n12. \nprioritized  by  financial  viability  and  implementation  capacity  from  130  projects  identified  through \nconsultations with a number of local governments across the country. Financing structures for the \nprojects will vary but, based on experience to date, the large majority will be structured around a \nlocal  investor  contributing  some  equity,  but  majority-funded  on  a  recourse  basis  by  national \nfinancial  institutions  (probably  commercial  banks).  The  RPDF  will  facilitate  linkages  to  investors \nand financial institutions. \n \nThe  RPDF  will  provide  funds  to  finance  consulting  services  to  help  local  governments \n13. \nprepare,  bid,  evaluate,  negotiate,  and  award  regional  infrastructure  PPP  projects.  It  will  support \nthe whole range of PPP options from concession, through build-operate-transfer and other forms \nof  investment  contracts,  to  management  contracts.  Local  governments  will  be  required  to  share \nthe costs of PPP project development in a manner that does not discourage initiatives in this area. \nThe  RPDF  will  only  be  available  to  local  governments  willing  to  comply  with  the  relevant \nguidelines  to  ensure  quality  transactions  that  are  prepared  efficiently  and  transparently, \ncompetitively  tendered,  and  well  implemented.  Financing  proportions  will  vary  according  to  the \nphase of project preparation. \n \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nFigure A8: Steps Involved in the Preparation and Execution of PPP Project \nTransactions \n\nProject Identification and Prioritization for \nFunding under the NPDF and RPDF \n\nProject Preparation and Transaction \nExecution \n\nStep 1: Project Identification and \nPrioritization (Line Ministries/Contracting \nAgencies/Local Governments) \n \n(cid:131)  Identification and screening of the PPP project \n(cid:131)  Public consultations in line with Perpres \n\n67/2005 \n\n(cid:131)  Prioritization for preparatory and execution \n\nsupport under the PDF using OGM screening \ncriteria  \n\n(cid:131)  Preparation of the proposal request for the \nsupport with detailed terms of reference for \nconsultants \n\n(cid:131)  Submission of a funding request to the PDF for \n\nthe above support  \n\nStep 2: Assessment (PMU) \n\n \n\n(cid:131)  Review of compliance of the proposed \nPPP project with Perpres. 67/2005 \n(cid:131)  Assessment of its suitability for PDF \n\nfunding, using predetermined selection \ncriteria  \n\n(cid:131)  Recommendation to the KKPPI Secretariat \nfor NPDF funding, subject to all selection \ncriteria met \n\n(cid:131)  Recommendation to the working group for \n\nRPDF projects \n\nStep 5: Transaction Execution \n(Line Ministries/Contracting \nAgencies/Local Governments) \n \n\n(cid:131)  With assistance of the PDF-funded \n\ntransaction advisers, bidding to select private \nsector partners, and execution of contractual \nagreements \n\n(cid:131)  Reporting to the KKPPI Secretariat \n(cid:131)  Implementation of the PPP project \n(cid:131)  Safeguards and statutory monitoring \n\nStep 4: \nProject Preparation (Line \nMinistries/Contracting Agencies/Local \nGovernments with PMU Support)  \n \n\n(cid:131)  Recruitment of consultants and transaction \nadvisers (can be combined or separated)  \n\n(cid:131)  Monitoring of project preparation \n(cid:131)  Quality assurance \n(cid:131)  Disbursement of progress payments \n\nStep 3: Oversight/Approval  \n \n\n(cid:131)  NPDF-funded projects will be approved by the deputy chairperson for infrastructure affairs of BAPPENAS, and \nreported at the next KKPPI ministerial meeting. If a new project that is not in the NPDF pipeline is proposed for \nfunding, then the line minister concerned will present the ministry\u2019s request for support at the KKPPI meeting. \nThis will ensure transparency and fairness in project selection. \n\n(cid:131)  RPDF-funded projects will be approved by the director of the PPP Directorate in BAPPENAS, and included in the \n\nconsolidated reporting to the KKPPI ministerial meeting.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n81 \n\nThe  sector  coverage  of  the  RPDF  will  include  (i) water  supply,  (ii)  wastewater  treatment \n14. \nand  sanitation,  (iii)  solid  waste  management  and  disposal  facilities,  (iv)  passenger  transport \nterminals,  (v)  markets,  (vi)  regional  government-owned  airports  and  seaports,  and  (vii)  other \nregional facilities as deemed appropriate by the RPDF steering committee. The RPDF is expected \nto finance the preparation and transaction execution of more than 40 such regional infrastructure \nprojects.  Selection  criteria  include  (i)  approval  of  the  PPP  project  by  the  head  of  the  regional \ngovernment; (ii) demonstration of its potential to generate revenue sufficient to recover the capital \ncosts  and  cover  all  operating  costs;  (iii)  written  commitment  from  the  regional  government  to \ncomply  with  applicable  national  laws,  regulations,  and  policies;  competitive  and  transparent \nprocesses;  and  all  relevant  environmental  and  social  safeguard  standards;  (iv)  written \ncommitment  from  the  concerned  regional  government  to  provide  in-kind  contribution  for  project \npreparation  and  transaction  execution;  and  (v)  submission  of  satisfactory  evidence  that  the \nregional government\u2019s exposure to debt servicing resulting from the PPP project will be governed \nby  all  applicable  national  Government  regulations.  If  a  cost-recovery  scheme  is  designed  and \nsuccessfully implemented, the RPDF may support a larger number of decentralized projects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Advisory Services and Capacity Building \n\n \n15. \nThis  component  will  provide  overall  technical  advisory  services  support  to  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) (para. 21) to function effectively in operating the NPDF and RPDF. PMU \nsupport  will  include  (i)  refinement  of  selection  criteria  for  providing  funding  support;  (ii) \nassessment of requests for PDF funding from the line ministries, contracting agencies, and local \ngovernments;  (iii)  technical  evaluation  of  proposals  from  consultants  to  be  recruited  for  PPP \nproject preparation and transactions execution; (iv) linking PPP venture proponents with financial \ninstitutions  capable  of  funding  the  proposed  projects;  (v)  based  on  a  review  of  the  PPP \nprocurement  process  in  the  first  few  projects,  assessment  of  the  potential  institutional  and \ncorruption  risks  involved,  and  recommendations  on  strengthening  the  regulatory  framework, \nincluding amending Perpres 67/2005 as appropriate, to mitigate such risks; (vi) advisory support \nto  the  KKPPI  on  cross-cutting  policy  or  regulatory  measures  in  the  areas  of  anticorruption, \ntransparency, and dispute resolution that would elicit greater private sector participation; and (vii) \noverall PPP project promotion.  \n \nThe technical advisory services group will comprise an international PPP expert, who will \n16. \nbe recruited to provide full-time support to the PDF for 4 years. International legal expertise will be \nmobilized  to  support  and  advise  the  PMU  on  matters  relating  to  PPP  contractual  arrangements \n(including  management, \nleasing,  and  build-operate-transfer  contracts;  and  concession \nagreements) and transaction execution. The PMU will recruit several national experts to help with \nnational and regional PPP projects, and international experts in the sectors to be funded from the \nRPDF,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  small-scale  regional  infrastructure,  to  provide \nsupport to local governments. \n \n17. \nEnhancing  awareness  of  PPP  projects  is  vital,  particularly  as  the  regulatory  framework \n(Perpres 67/2006) is still relatively new. In particular, private sector participation in decentralized \nprojects  needs  to  be  promoted  for  which  most  local  governments  still  lack  the  necessary \nunderstanding.  Continuous  capacity  building  is  also  vital,  both  at  the  national  and  decentralized \nlevels.  The  capacity-building  component  will  develop  a  training  module  for  PMU  staff,  covering \nproject  appraisal  based  on  feasibility  studies  and  other  PPP  project  documents;  and  undertake \ntraining  for  stakeholders  of  regional  infrastructure,  covering  PPP  basics  and  best  practice, \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies,  guidelines  for  tariff  setting  in  full  cost-recovery  projects,  and \nfinancing  options  for  PPP  project  implementation.  The  capacity-building  component  will  also \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nsupport  advanced  diploma  or  certificate  study  programs  for  government  officials  for  specialized \ntraining and education opportunities in areas related to PPP projects. \n\n \n3. \n\nProcurement and Administrative Services  \n\n \n18. \nThe role of this component is to help the PMU exercise its administrative and procurement \nfunctions for the PDF. The component will assist the PMU, as well as line ministries, contracting \nagencies,  and  local  governments,  in  refining  proposal  requests  (Figure  A8,  step  4).  All \nprocurement-related activities of the PMU will be handled under this component, including support \nto  procurement  teams  formed  under  the  NPDF  and  RPDF.  In  particular,  procurement  teams  for \nregional projects will receive assistance in the consultant selection process. The support will also \ninclude  coordinating  the  quality  assurance  process;  seeking  endorsement  from  line  ministries, \ncontracting  agencies,  and  local  governments  before  payments  are  made  to  consultants  and \ntransactions  advisers  recruited  under  the  PDF;  monitoring  and  managing  disbursements; \ndeveloping a database and information system to track all steps involved in project management, \nso  that  all  relevant  milestones  and  deliverables  are  met;  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project; \nand managing the project funds.  \n \nC. \n \nCost  Estimates.  The  total  cost  of the  Project is  estimated  at  $38.8  million  (Table A8.1). \n19. \nPPP  projects  under  the  NPDF  will  entail  a  higher  unit  cost  of  preparation  and  transaction \nexecution,  given  their  larger  scale.  The  allocation  for  RPDF  would  enable  the  preparation  of  a \nlarger  number  of  decentralized  PPP  projects,  which  will  be  less  resource  intensive  on  a  per-\nproject basis.  \n \n20. \nFinancing  Plan.  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $26.5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources. The Government of the Netherlands will provide $7.6 million in grant cofinancing. The \nGovernment of Indonesia will allocate staff and other resources in the equivalent of $4.7 million. \nTable A8.2 presents the financing plan.  \n \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\nTable A8.1: Cost Estimates for Project Development Facility  \n($ million) \n \n\nComponent and Description \nA.

The  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n21. \n(BAPPENAS)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  head  of  the  Directorate  for  Public-Private \nPartnerships  in  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  overall  project  director  for  the  PDF  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment.  The  PMU  to  be  established  under  the  directorate  will  coordinate  all  three  project \ncomponents.  The  PMU  will  be  staffed  by  qualified  personnel  and  host  the  technical  advisers \nengaged  under  the  second  component  who  will  assist  in  setting  up  and  managing  the  PDF, \ntraining and capacity building of stakeholders, promoting the RPDF with local governments, and \nformulating a long-term strategy for the PDF. Each participating local government will establish a \nregional  unit,  which  will  be  supported  by  the  PMU  in  managing  the  RPDF-funded  project \npreparation  and  transaction  execution.  A  Project  Steering  Committee  (PSC),  chaired  by \nBAPPENAS  Deputy  Chairman  for  Infrastructure  Affairs,  will  be  established  to  serve  as  a  high-\nlevel  decision-making  and  guiding  forum  for  NPDF  and  RPDF  and  will  comprise  senior \nrepresentatives of CMEA, MOF, Ministry of Home Affairs and the concerned line ministries, and a \nrepresentative of the associations of regional governments to participate as a resource person. \n \n22. \nSustainability of the PDF. Given the 5-year horizon of the PDF, ensuring continuity of the \ntechnical,  procurement,  and  administrative  support  provided  to  the  line  ministries,  contracting \nagencies, and local governments for project preparation and transaction execution is critical. The \nGovernment has agreed that these support functions will be gradually absorbed and continued by \nthe Central PPP Unit currently receiving assistance under two ongoing projects.6  \n________________________ \n6  ADB.  2005.    Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Support  for  Infrastructure  Development.  Manila \n(TA  4728-INO  for  $2  million,  to  be  completed  in  late  2007),  assists  the  BAPPENAS  Secretariat  of  the  KKPPI  in  a \nrange of areas including finalization and tracking of the Government\u2019s own reform program (the Infrastructure Policy \nPackage),  formulating  the  policy  framework  for  public  service  obligations,  initial  screening  and  identification  of \nprojects, and preparation of information memorandums for selected projects. The World Bank loan-financed Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Technical Assistance ($17 million, approved in 2002, to be completed in early 2007) is \nproviding advisory support on legal and regulatory issues to the KKPPI and selected line ministries, and in evaluating \nand finalizing project proposals. \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nProcurement Arrangements. The PMU will coordinate all procurement arrangements, as \n23. \noutlined  in para.  91  of the  main  text  and  below  (Table  A8.3).  The  sample  request  for  proposals \nwill be modified by the concerned line ministries, local governments, or contracting agencies and \nsubmitted for review and approval in line with the steps outlined in Figure A8. The beneficiaries of \nthe advanced international studies under the second component will be selected on a competitive \nbasis within the Government.  \n \n \n\nTable A8.3: Procurement Arrangements \n \n\nProcurement Needs and Mode \n\nComponent \n\nA.

Recruitment  of  consulting  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n85 \n\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  including  the  use  of  simplified  technical  proposals  and \nquality- and cost-based system for selection of consulting firms. \n \n25. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with \nthe  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n26. \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  the  Government  will \nestablish  an  imprest  account  to  finance  eligible  small  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nsolely  for  project  purposes  and  will  be  established  at  Bank  Indonesia  (BI).  The  account  will  be \nestablished, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2001)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The \nceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  $40,000  and  liquidation  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nstatement of expenditures (SOE) procedure for which the limit will be $10,000. ADB will disburse \nthe  remainder  of  the  TA  loan  in  accordance  with  direct  payment  procedures  as  described  in \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The Royal Netherlands Embassy in Indonesia will provide \ncounterpart funds for ADB to administer and these funds will be disbursed as described above. \n \nAccounting,  Auditing  and  Reporting.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  maintenance  of \n27. \nrecords and accounts to adequately identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. \nThe PMU will be responsible for the implementation of the Project including project supervision, \nmonitoring,  accounting,  and  reporting.  Based  upon  BI  reports,  the  PMU  will  provide  ADB  with \nconsolidated  semiannual  reports  on  project  implementation  (i.e.,  progress  on  commitments  and \ndisbursements, preparation status of the PPP projects, problems encountered, and actions taken \nto remedy the problems, and expected progress during the following half year). The EA will have \nimprest  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nwhose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance \nwith  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  and  as  specified  in  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nSOE  records  will  be  audited  as  part  of  the  annual  audit.  The  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB  certified \ncopies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports of \nthe auditors, within 6 months after the close of each financial year. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and SOE procedures should be included in the annual report. All \nother  reports  will  be  submitted  in  English  according  to  an  agreed  timetable.  The  Project  will  be \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines on the prevention of fraud and corruption.  \n \n28. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  To  ensure  that  PPP  projects  are \nprepared  effectively  and  that  their  benefits  are  maximized,  a  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem  (PPMS)  will  be  developed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management \nSystem  (PPMS)  Handbook  and  project  objectives.  The  PPMS  will  assist  the  PMU  in  monitoring \nfacility inputs, progress in assistance, outcomes, and impacts. Indicators of capacity building and \ninformation dissemination for government agencies, financial institutions, potential investors, and \nother stakeholders will be incorporated in the design of the system to facilitate the monitoring and \nevaluation of project benefits. Data collection for the PPMS will be undertaken by the PMU and \nregional governments. \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\nProject  Review.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  reviews  of  the \n29. \nProject  to  assess  progress  and  identify  constraints  and  ways  to  address  identified  constraints. \nSuch  reviews  will  commence  6  months  following  loan  effectiveness  to  enable  the  Executing \nAgency to make adjustments in the project design and implementation arrangements as needed. \nThe  review  will  cover  the  (i)  status  of  PPP  project  preparation  and  transaction  execution;  (ii) \nperformance of the consultants under the three project components; and (iii) possible changes in \nproject  scope,  implementation  arrangements  and  allocation  of  loan  proceeds.  A  midterm  review \nwill be conducted within 3 years of loan effectiveness. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe PDF will not finance any investments in project implementation, as it will support only \nthe  preparation  of  pre-  or  full  feasibility  studies  and  PPP  procurement  up  to  the  signing  of  the \nconcession  agreement  (or  other  contractual  arrangements).  Requests  for  any  subsequent  ADB \nfinancing for project investments will be dealt with separately, and will be subject to all of ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, particularly with regard to environmental and social safeguards. As ADB financing \nis  not  assumed  at  the  project  preparation  stage,  the  PDF  will  not  be  able  to  enforce  ADB\u2019s \ndetailed  safeguard  policies.  However,  the  principles  of  these  policies  are  reflected  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  existing  procedures.  Environmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  including \nissues  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples,  will  be  integral  components  in  the \npreparation  of  PPP  projects  to  be  supported  by  the  PDF.  For  projects  funded  from  the  PDF, \nenvironmental assessments will be undertaken and review procedures developed in compliance \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  own  existing  regulations,  and  in  broad  accordance  with  principles  and \nobjectives  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and  Operations  Manual  Section  F1: \nEnvironmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Social safeguard (involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous  peoples)  assessments  will  be  also  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  current \ngovernment  regulations.  In  the  event  that  ADB  financing  is  sought  for  project  implementation, \nadditional  assessments  may  have  to  be  carried  out  in  line  with  the  principles  and  objectives  of \nADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  as  outlined  in  Handbook  on \nPoverty and Social Analysis, and Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. As the \nprogram  loan  component  of  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  aims  to \nreduce  the  gaps  between  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  it  is  envisaged  that  there \nwill be convergence in the scope of the feasibility studies in these areas over the duration of the \nPDF. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A8.4: Legal and Regulatory Requirements and Criteria for PPP Projects \n\nNo.  REQUIREMENT/CRITERION \n\nA.

The TA \nwill  support  MOF  in  determining  and  providing  risk-sharing  support  to  private  investors  in \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  designing  and  establishing  infrastructure  financing  mechanisms.  For \nthe  KKPPI,  which  has  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  the  preparation,  bidding,  and \ncontracting  of  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  projects,  the  TA  will  provide  support  in  effective \ncommunications on and social marketing of infrastructure reforms. The TA has four components. \n \nB. \n\nScope \n \n1. \n\nRisk Management \n\n2. \nFiscal  prudence  has  been  the  Government\u2019s  overarching  principle  and  foundation  for \nmacroeconomic  management  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  While  this  prudence  has  served \nIndonesia well by reducing public debt from more than 100% of gross domestic product (GDP) to \nabout 45% in 2005 and containing fiscal deficit from more than 2.5% of GDP in the early 2000s to \n0.5%, it did impede development spending. Bearing in mind the adverse outcomes of the precrisis \npractice of open-ended assurances through \u201ccomfort letters\u201d to well-connected private investors, \nthe fiscal prudence has also translated into a very cautious stance by the Government with regard \nto  any  fiscal  support  to  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  large  and  risky  projects  with  revenue \nflows spread over a long period. With macroeconomic stability regained, the Government is taking \na more proactive stance with an increasing realization that investors will not come unless some \nform  of  assurance  is  given  by  the  public  sector.  To  attract  badly  needed  private  sector \ninvestments in infrastructure, MOF issued Decree 38/2006 on Risk Mitigation and Management in \nInfrastructure Provision that sets out the criteria for determining the Government\u2019s fiscal support, \nboth cash and noncash.  \n \n3. \nThe  various  forms  of  risk-sharing  support  that  the  Government  could  provide  include \ncoinvestments  in  PPP  projects  to  meet  their  upfront  needs  (e.g.,  for  land  acquisition);  fiscal \nincentives  such  as  tax-holidays  or  tax  exemptions;  subsidies;  and  event-dependent  guarantees. \nMOF  needs  help  in  assessing  the  type  and  level  of  risk-sharing  support  required  to  accelerate \ninfrastructure provision.  \n \n4. \nThe goal of this component is to help enhance the capacity of the Risk Management Unit \n(RMU)  in  MOF  through  on-the-job  training  and  analysis  of  risk-sharing  support  for  specific  PPP \ninfrastructure transactions. The tasks include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDetermine  the  type  of  government  support  that  should  be  provided  at  sector  and \nproject levels. \nEstablish, from a prudent macroeconomic management point of view, overall caps \non the risk-sharing support that the Government can provide. \n\n(iii)  Evaluate specific project proposals for risk-sharing support that are passed on by \nthe KKPPI to MOF, decide whether or not to provide such support; and determine \nthe caps on its direct and contingent portions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n89 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nLiaise  with  the  transactions  advisers  appointed  by  line  ministries  and  contracting \nagencies to learn the financial structure and technical details of the projects in the \npipeline that are likely to be submitted to the RMU. \nAdvise the KKPPI to ensure that the Government\u2019s support is the least possible but \nrealistic enough to attract investments. \n\n(vi)  Based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative  analyses  (including  evaluations  of  sector \npolicies  and  priorities;  demand  for  services  being  provided;  structure  of  the \nproposed transaction, etc.), recommend the type and size of the fiscal support for \neach transaction. \n\n(vii)  Evaluate  the  risk-sharing  arrangements  between  national,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments,  and  help  MOF  allocate  optimal  sharing  of  overall  obligations  for \nhigh-priority projects. \n\n(viii)  Advise on the establishment and structure of a guarantee fund, and formulate the \nstandard operating procedures anchored on fiscal prudence and good governance. \n(ix)  Estimate  the  annual  budgetary  allocations  required  to  meet  the  promised  fiscal \n\nsupport, and the potential drawdown from the guarantee fund. \n\n(x)  Monitor  and  assess  the  overall  financial  obligations  created  by  the  Government\u2019s \n\ndecisions. \n\n(xi)  Support  MOF  and  KKPPI  in  justifying  MOF\u2019s  decisions,  exposure  caused,  and \noutcomes  to  other  stakeholders  including  Parliament,  and  develop  an  effective \nstrategy for such interfaces. \n\n(xii)  Advise relevant MOF officials on reporting the risk-sharing support provided in line \n\nwith government accounting standards.  \n\n(xiii)  Based on these activities, advise MOF on reformulating the risk management and \n\noverall debt management strategy, whenever necessary.   \n\n \n5. \nExpertise  Needed  and  Duration  of  Advisory  Support.  This  TA  component  has  to  be \nimplemented in a flexible manner, given that the need for advisory support will be contingent on \nthe pace at which project transactions are submitted to MOF. Figure A9 illustrates the expertise \nneeded and the indicative duration of support. Implementation will be divided into two phases.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPhase 1 (3 months). The experts will establish contact with officials in MOF and \nKKPPI; formulate a detailed work plan; agree with MOF officials on their functions \nand  responsibilities;  begin  to  build  up  basic  capacity  in  the  RMU  team  based  on \nthe  initial  transactions  that  the  team  will  evaluate;  and  demonstrate  how  in-depth \nassessments are made and decisions reached through actual project transactions. \nThe experts will discuss the needs for their field presence in phase 2 and work out \na clear plan for continuous remote access and interface with the relevant MOF and \nother ministry officials during their absence. \nPhase  2  (15  months).  This  phase  will  be  implemented  in  a  flexible  manner  with \nregard to the retainer experts, to give time for projects to be prepared, considered \nby the KKPPI, and submitted to the RMU for risk-sharing support. The experts may \nspend part of this phase in Indonesia, while the remaining part will be spent on a \nretainer  basis  at  their  home  offices  or  through  visits  to  Indonesia  as  needed,  so \nthat they can provide continuous support to government officials.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f90 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFigure A9: Expertise to Be Provided Under the First Component to the Risk \nManagement Unit of the Ministry of Finance \n\nCore Team \n\nRetainer Team \n\nRisk management adviser and \nteam coordinator (international, 18 \nperson-months continuous) \n\nRisk management expert (national, \n18 person-months) \n\nRisk management legal expert \n(national, 12 person-months) \n\nRisk management experts in the \npower sector (international, 8 \nperson-months intermittent; \nnational, 12 person-months) \n\nRisk management experts in toll \nroads (international, 8 person-\nmonths intermittent; national, 12 \nperson-months intermittent) \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEstablishment of a Sound Fiduciary Framework for Fund Management  \n\n \n6. \nThe  Government  is  contemplating  establishing  various  funding  mechanisms  to  support \nPPP projects, including an Indonesia infrastructure fund, a guarantee fund, and a revolving fund \nfor land acquisition. While the institutional mechanisms for these funds are being formulated, the \nDirectorate  General  of  Treasury  in  MOF  is  expected  to  oversee  their  establishment  and \nmonitoring from a fiduciary point of view. This TA component will support MOF in designing and \nestablishing  a  sound  fund  management  structure.  An  international  funds  management  adviser \nand  a  national  funds  management  expert  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis  for  about  10 \nperson-months each. Their tasks will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAdvise the Directorate General of Treasury on the optimal management structures, \nconsistent  with  Indonesian  regulations  and  international  best  practices,  for  the \nvarious funds. \nDesign the necessary monitoring, operation, and financial reporting systems within \nMOF for the various funds. \nFormulate, in consultation with the line agencies responsible for conceptualizing or \nestablishing the funds, the standard operating procedures for interfacing with MOF.  \nPrepare  an  operations  manual  for  the  various  funds  for  use  in  MOF  and  other \nagencies concerned. \n\n3. \n\nReform Communication and Social Marketing \n\nThe  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  covers  nine  sectors,  spanning \n7. \nthe jurisdiction of close to 20 line ministries, agencies and regulatory bodies, and a large number \nof state-owned enterprises, and consists of many actions and outputs. Given the complexity and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n91 \n\npolitical  sensitivity  of  reforms,  for  instance  in  regulatory  arrangements  or  cost  recovery,  their \nrationale must be clearly communicated both within and outside the Government. Without this, the \nrisk  is  considerable  that  the  reforms  may  not  be  understood  well  by  the  general  public,  or even \nthe  concerned  government  officials.  An  international  communications/social  marketing  expert \nengaged for 4 person-months will support the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA), \nwhich  acts  as  the  KKPPI  Secretariat,  in  designing  a  communication  strategy.  He/she  will  be \nassisted by a national expert engaged for 10 person-months. Tasks will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nHelp  the  KKPPI  identify  sensitive  reform  initiatives  that  need  to  be  effectively \ncommunicated to stakeholders, both within and outside the Government. \nDesign communication strategies that can be modified and replicated for different \ntypes  of  reforms  and  stakeholders,  integrating  lessons  from  other  countries  and \ngood communication practices adopted elsewhere. \nAdvise the KKPPI if such communication has not worked in other countries and, if \nso, explore with the concerned line ministries/agencies (through the KKPPI) what \nchanges  if  any  can  be  made  in  modifying  the  presentational  aspects  or  timing  of \nthe reform initiatives.    \nDesign  communication  materials  for  at  least  two  important  and  sensitive  reform \nareas, and disseminate them through effective channels. \n\n4. \n \n\nSupport \nDevelopment Facilities  \n\nfor  Preliminary  Technical  Preparations  under \n\nthe  Project \n\n8. \nThe  project  loan  will  help  accelerate  PSP  in  infrastructure  sectors  by  supporting  the \nestablishment of an infrastructure project development facility (PDF). The PDF will alleviate one of \nthe  most  critical  constraints  impeding  infrastructure  development,  namely,  the  lack  of  adequate \nproject preparation. This TA component will help finalize technical preparations for the PDF so as \nto ensure quality at entrance and readiness of the PDF to work effectively. An international project \nmanagement specialist and a national procurement specialist engaged for 5 months will support \nthe  Directorate  for  Public-Private  Partnerships  in  BAPPENAS,  which  acts  as  the  overall  project \ndirectorate for the PDF on behalf of the Government, in preparing start up documentation for each \nproject proposal. Their tasks will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nHelp  the  Directorate  conduct  demand  surveys  for  selected  projects,  and  collect \nbaseline data for these; \nPrepare standard (pre-)feasibility study, bidding and contract documentation for the \nPDF; \nDevelop  public  campaign  kits  and  conduct  public  information  and  communication \nactivities and workshops; \nConsult  with  national  and  local  governments  on  the  suggested  implementation \narrangements for the PDF and finalize detailed arrangements thereafter; and \nPrepare the project organizational setup in BAPPENAS. \n\nImplementation and Reporting Arrangements \n\nImplementation. The executing agencies will be \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  RMU  under  the  newly  established  Fiscal  Policy  Office  in  MOF  for  the  risk \nmanagement component; \nDirectorate General for Treasury in MOF for the funds management component;  \n\n \n\n \n \nC. \n \n9. \n \n\n \n\n\f92 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCMEA  represented  by  the  deputy  for  infrastructure  for  the  reform  communication \nand social marketing component; and \nDirectorate for Public-Private Partnerships in BAPPENAS for quality at entrance of \nthe PDF. \n\ninfrastructure  projects, \n\nthe  emerging  pipeline  of \n\n \n10. \nRecruitment. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  Given  the  complexity  of  risk  management  and  since  the  extent  of  the \nadvisory  services  will  depend  on \nthe \nimplementation arrangements for the first component will be kept flexible. If a firm can provide the \nretainer type of services in a flexible manner without increasing the cost significantly, then a firm \nwill be recruited. Otherwise, the core team will be recruited initially on an individual basis, and the \nteam coordinator will be responsible for recruiting the retainer team and formulating a work plan to \nutilize  their  services  depending  on  the  risk  assessment  needs  for  specific  projects.  Further,  as \nsuch needs may evolve and change during TA implementation, the allocation of person-months \nfor the first component is indicative only. If the Government and ADB feel that consultants should \ninitially  be  recruited  for  a  shorter  duration  to  meet  specific  needs,  with  resources  reserved  for \nfuture emerging needs, such an approach will be adopted. The consultants under the second and \nthird components will be recruited on an individual basis.  \n \n11. \nReporting  Arrangements.  The  team  leaders  for  the  respective  components  will \ncoordinate the reporting arrangements. Inception, mid-contract, and final reports will be prepared \nfor  all  components.  Emphasis  will  be  on  technical  content  rather  than  administrative  aspects, \ndescribing  the  advice  provided  to  the  Government  in  simple  terms.  Operational  guidelines  or \nmanuals should be comprehensive and final versions should be prepared with stakeholder inputs. \nIn addition, technical briefs will be prepared by consultants on a needs basis. \n \nD. \n \nTable  A9  presents  an  indicative  allocation  of  the  TA  resources  across  the  four \n12. \ncomponents.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2,500,000.  The  Government  has  asked \nADB  to  finance  $2,000,000  on  a  grant  basis,  with  the  rest  to  be  provided  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart support by the concerned executing agencies. Most of this support is expected to be \nin the form of government staff inputs, which are already factored into the regular work plans.  \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n\fTable A9: Cost Estimates for Technical Assistance for Enhancing Infrastructure Provision \n\n \n\n \n\n  Item  \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n93 \n\nUnit Cost  Total Cost \n\n($ '000) \n\nc.

Greater  provision  of  infrastructure  and  related \nservices has a particularly beneficial impact on the poor by, for instance, improving access to markets and areas with \ngreater  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  For  the  poor,  in  particular,  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation; \nrural electrification; and better community and subdistrict infrastructure can have tremendous beneficial impacts.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s  poor  investment  climate  and  major  deficiencies  in  infrastructure  provision  have  been  identified  as  key \nconstraints to growth. Infrastructure progress has virtually been at stand-still since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Due \nto lack of adequate investment for maintenance, the quality of existing infrastructure has worsened. In particular, the \ndeterioration of water supply and sanitation infrastructure and transport networks (roads, railways and sea transport) \nhas led to a lower quality of life for the poor. For instance, a large majority of the population (an estimated 210 million) \nliving outside of urban areas does not have access to sewerage systems.  \n \nThe constraints that affect growth and impede poverty reduction are characterized by \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\npoor  service  coverage  outside  of  Java,  in  general  in  all  infrastructure  sectors;  where  some  services  are \navailable, the quality is low, disjointed, and unreliable; \nregional  disparities in the  availability  of public sector resources and  weaknesses in legal and institutional \nframeworks curtailing investment; and \nfailure to meet public service obligations (PSOs) by many state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and lack of a \nconsistent approach across the sectors in this regard. \n\n \nAny  tariff  adjustment  would  inevitably  have  an  impact  on  the  poor.  Nonetheless,  tariffs  must  be  in  line  with  cost-\nrecovery  principles  to  ensure  adequate  quantity  and  quality  of  infrastructure  services.  In  one  major  area,  namely  oil \nprices, the Government recently reduced subsidies, as these subsidies never benefited the poor (given that the middle \nclass consumed the most). Given the large and direct impact through the general rise in inflation following the increase \nin oil prices in 2005, the Government designed and implemented a credible compensation program. A medium-term \nexpenditure  program,  with  efficient  public  expenditure  reorientation,  is  being  designed.  The  2006  budget  already \nreflects large reallocations to pro-poor programs. \n \nAnother  major  constraint  entails  land  acquisition  for  infrastructure  projects.  The  Presidential  Regulation  (Perpres) \n36/2005,  as  amended  through  Perpres  65/2006,  provides  a  good  framework  for  land  acquisition.  Implementing \nregulations are being drafted, aimed to bring the Indonesian legal requirements on livelihood restoration, consultation, \ngrievance  redressal,  and  rights  of  squatters  in  alignment  with  those  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  For  the \nfinancing  for  land  acquisition,  particularly  for  toll-road  projects,  the  need  for  the  Government  to  provide  public \ninvestment  support,  given  the  cost  as  well  as  implementation  difficulties  in  acquiring  land,  is  becoming  clearer.  A \nbalanced regulatory framework is critical to guide such public investments and safeguard the interests of those likely \nto be affected.    \n \nThe Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) adopts a comprehensive approach to deal with all of \nthese  issues  over  the  medium-term.  Given  the  complexity  of  reforms,  a  program  cluster  framework  is  adopted  to \nsupport  infrastructure  development  in  a  phased  manner.  The  primary  objective  of  the  IRSDP  is  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate, and thereby boost economic growth and reduce poverty.  \n \nOverall,  IRSDP  implementation  will  have  a  net  beneficial  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Besides  addressing  the \nimmediate quality of life concerns (through, for instance, leveraging improved provision of water supply and sanitation \nservices),  the  IRSDP  will  enhance  access  and  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  by  2010.  Decentralized \ninfrastructure projects, particularly the model PPPs to be pursued under subcomponents 2 and 3, will help in direct job \ncreation. The proposed project development facility will have a direct positive impact by designing such projects. \n \nIn  parallel  with  the  IRSDP,  the  Government  is  implementing  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Strengthening  Program  (also \nsupported by ADB through the Rural Infrastructure Support Project, approved in December 2005), which gives special \nattention to infrastructure needs in poorer and disadvantaged regions of Indonesia. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n95 \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  IRSDP  directly  supports  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  programs  on  poverty  reduction.  In  particular,  the \nmeasures in the IRSDP have close linkages with (i) the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS); (ii) the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement between the Government ADB, and elements of the NPRS supported under the agreement; \nand (iii) the Government\u2019s medium-term development plan (RPJM) with its clear poverty reduction targets of halving \npoverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% in 2009.   \n \nSome noteworthy features of the linkages between the IRSDP actions and the NPRS include the following:  \n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nThe IRSDP focuses on enhancing private sector participation in NPRS implementation through broad-ranging \nmeasures,  by  strengthening  the  overall  investment  climate,  and  other  supplementary  reforms  that  are \nundertaken in coordination with projects supported by ADB and other development partners.  \n\n\u2022  Measures  for  mobilizing  public  and  private  sector  resources  for  immediate  and  long-term  infrastructure \n\ndevelopment will have significant effects on poverty reduction. \nThe  focus  on  risk-sharing  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  will  help  meet  the  demand  for \ninfrastructure needed to provide basic services and attract productive investments to generate employment.  \n\n \nIndicative links between IRSDP actions and the NPRS are shown in the following table. \n \n\nLinks between the National Poverty Reduction Strategy  \nand the Infrastructure Reform Program  \nInfrastructure Reform Program Policy Actions \n\n\u2022  Reduce subsidies to non-poor, and evaluate administered prices. \n\u2022  Attract PSP in infrastructure development in commercially viable sectors, and \n\nconserve public sector resources for increasing health and education spending. \n\n\u2022  Provide direct support for water supply and sanitation projects. \n\u2022  Conserve public sector resources for essential social sector needs. \n\u2022  Adopt an overall framework for public service obligations (PSOs), leading to \nharmonized treatment and provisions for PSOs across all infrastructure sectors. \n\u2022  Develop a clear legal framework in each infrastructure sector governing PSOs.   \n\n\u2022  Provide foremost emphasis on designing and strengthening public-private \n\npartnerships in all infrastructure sectors. \n\nNational Poverty \nReduction Strategy  \nMacroeconomic Stability \nPrudent fiscal \nmanagement \n\n \n\nBasic Rights  \nBasic services such as \nhealth, education, and \nwater supply; access to \ndecent work; and \nreduction of regional \ninequalities \n\n \n\nPoverty Partnership Implementation Mechanism \nPrivate sector to play a \nrole in investment, \nproduction, and \ndistribution of goods and \nservices; generate taxes; \ncreate jobs and \ninfrastructure; and \nprovide access to assets \nand technology \n\n \n\nParticipatory Process \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n   Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nNote: The IRSDP is anchored on the Government\u2019s comprehensive Infrastructure Policy Package. In formulating this \npackage,  the  Government  undertook  several  rounds  of  consultations  with  a  broad-range  of  stakeholders.  ADB \nparticipated in these consultations. Some key elements of the policy package with a possible direct impact on the poor \n(e.g., implementing mechanisms for land acquisition) will be discussed before being finalized. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nD.

Support provided under the IRSDP to \nimprove the legal framework for land acquisition for public \ninfrastructure will result in government land acquisition practices \nconforming more closely to the requirement of ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement policy.   \nThe IRSDP supports a general review of tariff policies in all \ninfrastructure sectors. In one key area\u2014oil\u2014the Government \nhas already started moving away from the administered price \nmechanism. It has put in place an adequate compensation \nprogram to cushion the immediate adverse impact of price \nincreases on the poor. This will be supplemented by effective \npublic expenditure reorientation in the medium term. The \nadoption of sound approaches to meet the PSOs will mitigate \nany adverse effects of tariff adjustments. Moving forward, the \nGovernment also needs to address electricity tariff adjustments, \nas inability to recover costs greatly affects the State Electricity \nCorporation\u2019s financial viability. The Government\u2019s vision is to \nadopt a progressive system that protects the poor in the event \nupward adjustments are made on tariffs.  \n \nThe impact on labor is positive through improvement in the \ninvestment climate. The IRSDP promotes investments in one of \nthe most productive areas, namely infrastructure development. \nThe policy and legal measures, as well as the public and private \nsector transactions that will be supported in general through the \nIRSDP, will create jobs necessary to absorb the increasing \nnumber of unemployed.  \n \nImprovement of the legal framework will facilitate land \nacquisition for public infrastructure. Perpres 36/2005 and \nPerpres 65/200 recognize traditional communal lands or \nusufruct rights. The implementing regulations currently being \ndrafted to these presidential regulations are expected to help \nbring Indonesian legal requirements close to ADB\u2019s \nrequirements on the rights of indigenous people. \n \nExternal factors (increasing terrorist acts or pandemic) or \npolitical disturbances could result in incomplete implementation \nof the policies or delay in achieving anticipated benefits of the \nIRSDP. The Government has focused its attention on \nconsensus building for sensitive reforms (e.g., tariff policies; \nland acquisition). Risks stemming from policy or regulatory \nreversals are recognized, and the KKPPI is empowered to \ncoordinate and balance between the investors\u2019 and Indonesia\u2019s \nnational interests.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n \nx  No  \n\n Yes \n\n \nX  No \n\n Yes \n\n \nx No  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 September 2006) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.000109 \nRp9,130 \n", " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n", "Planning Agency) \n", "ADB \nBAPPENAS  \u2013  Badan  Perancanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional  (National  Development \n", "BPJT \nBPP SPAM \n", "\u2013  Badan Pengatur Jalan Toll (Indonesian Toll Road Authority) \n\u2013  Badan Pendukung Pengembangan Sistem Penyediaan Air Minimum \n", "(National Water Regulatory Agency) \n", "BRTI \n", "\u2013  Badan Regulasi Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Indonesian \n", "Telecommunications Regulatory Body) \n", "Indonesia Infrastructure Summit \nindependent power producer \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n", "\u2013  Badan Usaha Milik Daerah (local government owned enterprise) \n\u2013  coal bed methane \n\u2013  Consolidated Indonesia Infrastructure Forum \n\u2013  Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \n\u2013  Gross domestic product \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n\u2013  PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Indonesian Railway Corporation) \n\u2013  National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure Development \n\u2013  Kilometer \n\u2013  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Transportation \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \n\u2013  national component of the project development facility \n  National Poverty Reduction Strategy \n\u2013  Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (regional water supply company) \n\u2013  project development facility \n\u2013  PT Pelabuhan Indonesia (Indonesian Port Corporation) \n\u2013  presidential regulation \n\u2013  PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation)  \n\u2013  project management unit \n\u2013  Public-private partnership \n\u2013  Public service obligation \n\u2013  private sector participation \n\u2013  Risk Management Unit \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah (Medium-Term Development \n", "regional component of the project development facility \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", "BUMD \n", " \n  CBM \n  CIIF \n  CMEA \n  GDP \nIIS \n \nIPP \n \nIRSDP \n \nJBIC \n \nKAI \n \nKKPPI \n \n \nkm \n  MEMR \n  MOF \nMOT \nMPW \nNPDF \nNPRS \nPDAM \nPDF \nPELINDO \nPerpres \nPLN \nPMU \nPPP \nPSO \nPSP \nRMU \nRPDF \nRPJM \n", "Plan) \n", "SOE \nTA \n", "\u2013  state-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \n", "NOTES \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", "C.
