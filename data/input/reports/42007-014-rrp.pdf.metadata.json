The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Rural Small \nBusiness Access to Finance, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n  \nThe  project  will  enable  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  rural  small  businesses  to  grow, \n2. \ndevelop,  expand,  compete,  and  play  a  greater  income-generating role  in Uzbekistan. Through \nthis financial  intermediation  loan,  participating  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  will  provide  subloans \nto small businesses. At least 30% of the subloans will be to women\u2019s small businesses2 and at \nleast 50% will be to small businesses outside the city of Tashkent. The project will be supported \nby  TA  to  strengthen  PCBs\u2019  capacity  to  provide  loans  to  and  improve  the  entrepreneurial \ncapacities of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. The project implementation \nperiod is 2014\u20132017.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  significance  of  small  businesses  in  providing  jobs  and  driving  growth  is \nhigh  in  Uzbekistan.3 The  contribution  of  small  businesses  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nincreased  from  35.0%  in  2003  to  54.6%  in  2012. 4  Small  businesses  are  mainly  active  in \nagriculture (98.0% of the sector output). Other important sectors include construction (70.7% of \nthe sector output), retail trade (45.3%), and services (44.7%). In 2012, about 9.3 million people \nworked  in  small  businesses\u2014or  75.2%  of the total  number  of  persons  employed.  At the  same \ntime, 37.2% of total investments in 2012 went to small businesses. \n \nIn  Uzbekistan,  48.8%  of  the  29.2  million  population  live  and  work  in  rural  areas.5 Low-\n4. \nincome  earners  in  Uzbekistan  accounted  for  17.5%  of  the  population  in  2011. 6  Small \nbusinesses  contribute  more  than  60.0%  of  gross  regional  product  in  9  of  14  regions,  with \nSyrdarya region being the highest (80.0%). The largest share of the total number of employed \npersons is in agriculture and forestry, accounting for 48.3% of employed women and 51.7% of \nemployed men. However, the contribution of agriculture to GDP decreased from 30.0% in 2000 \nto  about  18.0%  in  2011.  Of  the  micro  and  small  enterprises  registered  in  2012,  84.5%  were \noutside  the  city  of  Tashkent,  as  were  81.5%  of  all  individual  entrepreneurs  in  2011.  Male \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Under the proposed project, women\u2019s small business is defined as being one of the following: (i) at least 50% of \nenterprise ownership is controlled by women,  or (ii) at least 50% of managers are women, or (iii) at least 50% of \nthe registered employees of the enterprise are women. \n\n3   The definition of small business is stipulated in Article 5 of Law N 69-II, enacted on 25 May 2000 and amended on \n2 May 2012, which states that small business includes individual entrepreneurs, microfirms, and small enterprises. \n(Government of Uzbekistan. 2000.

Tashkent. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nentrepreneurship in rural areas is high in Namangan, accounting for 71.0% of total registration, \nfollowed by the Navoi, Fergana, and Bukhara regions (footnote 5).  \n\n \n5. \nThe  financial  sector  is  dominated  by  banks:  the  banking  subsector\u2019s  assets  accounted \nfor  37.0%  of  GDP  in  2012.  Eight  banks  with  state  ownership  accounted  for  76.1%  of  total \nbanking  assets  in  2012.  The  total  banking  loan  portfolio  accounted  for  21.1%  of  GDP  and \ndeposits accounted for 23.6% of GDP in 2012.7 Lending to small businesses comprised 26.3% \nof  banks\u2019  outstanding  loans  in  2012  and  microcredit  loans  comprised  5.7%  of  banks\u2019  total \noutstanding  loans.8 While  small  business  lending  has  doubled  since  2006  and  the  microcredit \nloan portfolio has grown nearly fourfold in that period, lending to women was less than 15.0% of \ntotal bank lending in 2012. \n \nFinancial services and delivery mechanisms do not meet the needs of small businesses, \n6. \nparticularly outside the city of Tashkent. The branch network is limited and rural areas have few \npoints  of  service  terminals,  creating  constraints  for  existing  and  potential  bank  clients.  Cost  of \ntransportation  and  time  spent  accessing  financial  services  are  other  limiting  factors.  Small \nbusinesses  have  limited  access  to  business  development  services  that  contribute  to  the \nefficiency,  profitability,  and  expansion  of  their  activities.  Focus  group  discussions  suggest  that \nsmall  businesses  lack  access  to  information  on  government  programs,  market  opportunities, \nsuppliers,  competitors,  technology,  and  banking  products.  Weak  financial  literacy,  especially \namong  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  low-income  groups,  limits  their  access  to  financial \nservices  and  constrains  their  entrepreneurial  capacity.  Very  limited  financial  services  and \nproducts  are  adapted  to  the  needs  of  rural  small  businesses,  which  are  largely  dependent  on \nagricultural  cycles.  Access  to  electronic  banking  (e-banking)  is  low.9 While  debit  cards  are the \nmost developed payment channel, about 70.0% of households do not have such cards, making \ncash their only payment option.10 \n \n7. \nLimited  access  to  bank  credit  and  the  high  cost  of  borrowing  are  among  the  largest \nimpediments  to  small  businesses.  The  lack  of  liquidity  and  availability  of  capital,  coupled  with \nhigh  perceived  risks  and  high  administrative  costs  when  lending  to  small  businesses,  compel \nbanks to charge high interest rates. Bank loans usually have short maturities, restraining small \nbusinesses  from  expanding  and  modernizing.  Only  one-third  of  the  total  microcredit  loan \nportfolio  of  banks  is for more  than  3 years;  the  rest  has  maturities  between 6  and  24  months. \nWeak bank risk management capacity restricts their lending, preventing engagement with small \nbusinesses that have little or no collateral. Insufficient collateral also limits the size of loans, thus \nrestricting  small  businesses  from  borrowing  more  for  their  business  expansion  and  capital \ninvestments. Collateral requirements for small businesses (146.0% of the loan size) are higher \nthan  for  large  enterprises  (128.0%  of  the  loan  size). 11  In  stakeholder  and  focus  group \ndiscussions,  insufficient  collateral  was  cited  as  the  single  greatest  impediment  to  borrowing. \n\n                                                \n7   Central Bank of Uzbekistan. 2013. Unpublished. \n8   In  accordance  with  the  Law  on  Microfinance,  the  size  of  a  microcredit  cannot  exceed  1,000  times  the  minimum \nwage,  which  is  adjusted  from  time  to  time  by  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  (Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2006. \nLaw of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Microfinance. http://www.lex/uz).  The President\u2019s Decree N4547, dated 11 \nJuly  2013,  established  the  minimum  wage  level  at  SUM91,350  starting  from  15  August  2013.  This  brings  the \nmaximum size of a microcredit to $43,200 equivalent using the exchange rate as of 16 August 2013 (Government \nof  Uzbekistan.  2013.  President\u2019s  Decree  N4547  on  Increasing  the  Salaries,  Pensions, Stipends and  Allowances. \nTashkent). \n\n9   E-banking includes plastic cards, internet-based e-banking channels, and payment services provided via terminals \n\nand online payment systems. E-banking in Uzbekistan is linked to bank accounts.  \n\n10  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides a further discussion on \n\nsmall business and entrepreneurship development. \n\n11  World Bank. 2011. The World Bank Group\u2019s Enterprise Survey. Washington, DC.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   3 \n\nCommon  forms  of  collateral  include  cars,  jewelry,  and  real  estate.  Banks  offer  third-party \nguarantors, but they are difficult to find for first-time borrowers as they are often considered high \nrisk.  \n \nThe  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  aims  to  improve  the  ability  of \n8. \nwomen\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses to operate and expand. It will help these \nentrepreneurs build productive enterprises in profitable sectors, operate to scale, access finance, \nand  benefit  from  economic  opportunities.  The  PCBs  will  benefit  from  increased  long-term \nfinance  and  stronger  institutional  capacity,  which  will  enable  them  to  better  meet  the  financial \nservices  demand  of  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  rural  small  businesses.  It  will  also  enable \nPCBs  to  (i)  provide  short-  and  medium-term  subloans  in  either  sum  or  US  dollars  to  small \nbusinesses;  (ii)  diversify  income  sources;  (iii)  spread  risk;  and  (iv)  increase  the  delivery  of \nfinancial  services  and  products  such  as  e-banking,  online  loan  applications,  and  services  to \nsupport  business  development.  The  attached  TA  will  support  project  implementation  by \nimproving  the  capacity  of  PCBs,  their  client  small  businesses,  and  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan (CBU).  \n\n \n9. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  both  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  with  Uzbekistan \nand government policy. The country partnership strategy 2012\u20132016 and the country operations \nbusiness  plan  2012\u20132014  support  government  reforms  to  enable  small  business  to  be  an \nengine  of  growth,  diversification,  and  investment  for  the  economy. 12 Presidential  resolutions \nsupport  microfinance  development  to  finance  small  businesses  and  raise  employment  and \nwelfare. 13  State  programs  include  measures  to  enhance  women\u2019s  role  in  governance  and \nimprove the business environment. The project will build on two previous  loans that supported \naccess  to  credit  for  micro  and  small  enterprises  and  job  creation.14 It  will  also  build  on  (i)  an \nequity investment in Ipak Yuli Bank to improve banking sector quality, increase lending to small \nand medium-sized enterprises, and help catalyze foreign investment in Uzbekistan; 15 and (ii) an \nintegrated  rural  development  program  that  provides  access  to  long-term  housing  finance  and \nsupports  the  building  of  new  houses  in  rural  areas. 16 Lessons  learned  include  the  need  to \nstrengthen  bank  capacity  for  rural  outreach,  the  continued  need  to  target  women\u2019s  small \nbusinesses, and the importance of closely monitoring PCBs during project implementation.17 In \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2012.

Manila. \n\n17  Under  the  first  Small  and  Microfinance  Development  Project,  one  PCB  was  discontinued  because  it  failed  to \ncomply  with  all  loan  covenants  during  loan  implementation  (ADB.  2011.  Completion  Report:  Small  and \nMicrofinance Development Project in Uzbekistan. Manila). Under the Second Small and Microfinance Development \nProject, one PCB was discontinued for its failure to comply with all loan covenants during loan implementation. The \nunused  loan  funds  under  the  project  were  reallocated  to  the  remaining  two  PCBs.  As  part  of  project  monitoring, \nADB  conducts  reviews  to  ensure  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria  for  subloans  issued  under  the  project.  Only \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nconsultations  with  the  government,  international  development  partners,  potential  PCBs, \nwomen\u2019s  associations,  and  academia,  the  project  team  found  broad  support  for  the  proposed \nproject.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  viable  rural  small  businesses  with  women\u2019s  participation.  The \noutcome  will  be  increased  financial  access  by  rural  small  businesses  with  women\u2019s \nparticipation.18 \n \nC. \n \nThe project will have two outputs: (i) strengthened capacity of PCBs to deliver financial \n11. \nservices to women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses, and (ii) improved borrowing \ncapacity of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. The project loan will finance \nsubloans under output 1, while the TA will support outputs 1 and 2. \n \n12. \nOutput  1.  Strengthened  capacity  to  deliver  financial  services  to  women\u2019s  small \nbusinesses  and  rural  small  businesses  includes  the  financial  capacity  of  PCBs  to  provide \nsubloans, as supported by the ADB loan. To enable PCBs to better understand the challenges \nfaced by women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses in accessing finance, the TA will \nhelp strengthen the capacity of PCB staff to (i) design and conduct annual customer surveys on \nthe demand for financial services and their quality, as well as needs for capacity building among \nbank clients, including financial literacy; (ii) assess existing lending strategies towards women\u2019s \nsmall businesses and rural small businesses; and (iii) sensitize and train PCB staff on women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship  needs  and  tailored  programs.  To  better  meet  client  demands  for  financial \nservices, the TA will contribute to the design of at least two new financial products in each bank \nto  target  project  beneficiaries.  To  enable  PCBs  to  simplify  access  to  financial  services  and \nincrease  their  outreach  to  rural  small  businesses,  the  TA  will  support  the  development  of  (i) \nonline  systems  for  processing  loan  applications  and  e-banking,  and  (ii)  simplified  loan \napplication procedures. To enable PCBs to better evaluate the potential risk posed by lending, \nmitigate  losses  from  bad  debts,  and  increase  efficiency  in  small  business  lending,  the  TA  will \nhelp  (i)  strengthen risk management  practices and  credit  assessment  standards,  including  the \nadoption  of  credit  scoring  techniques;  (ii)  adopt  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards \n(IFRS); (iii) develop monitoring and supervision methodology to prevent loan delinquency in the \ntarget group; and (iv) establish a monitoring and evaluation framework with sex-disaggregated \ndata to track performance, outreach, impact, and achievement of targets and indicators for the \nADB  project.  These  activities  will  enable  PCBs  to  increase  their  outreach  to  potential \nsubborrowers and issue at least 5,000 new microcredit loans and 100 new small business loans \nunder the project.19 \n \n13. \nOutput  2.  The  capacity  for  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  rural  small  businesses  to \nborrow  will  be  improved  through  awareness  campaigns  and  workshops.  To  strengthen  the \nentrepreneurial  capacities  of  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  rural  small  businesses,  and  to \nincrease  their  access  to  financial  services,  the  TA  will  use  a  training-of-trainers  approach  to \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nsubloans that meet the eligibility criteria will be credited under the project.

These  services  will  help  small  businesses,  particularly  project \nbeneficiaries, build productive enterprises in profitable sectors, operate to scale, access finance, \nbenefit from economic opportunities, and improve subborrower loan repayment capacity. These \nsteps  can  enable  small  businesses  to  have  a  greater  role  in  income-generating  activities  by \nbuilding capacity of potential subborrowers and facilitating access to subloans under the project \nfor  at  least  3,000  subborrowers.

To  effectively  support  government \n14. \npromotion  of  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  small  businesses  in  rural  areas,  the  government \nhas requested a loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a \n20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements.  \n \nThe Republic of Uzbekistan as borrower will relend the proceeds from the ADB loan in \n15. \nUS dollars through subsidiary loan agreements to PCBs that meet ADB eligibility criteria (para. \n22).20 PCBs  will  provide  $50  million  equivalent  in  counterpart  funding,  and  subborrowers  will \nprovide  $33.33  million  as  equity  contributions.  Under  the  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  the \ngovernment is expected to relend to the PCBs for 15 years, including a 5-year grace period. The \ngovernment\u2019s relending rate will be the interest rate charged by ADB for the loan plus an annual \npremium of 0.2% to cover administrative expenses and risks incurred by the government.

ADB  has  a \nlimited conflict of interest with respect to Ipak Yuli Bank as ADB is a 13.6% shareholder and an \nADB officer sits on its board. Mitigating factors are (i) Ipak Yuli Bank is one of potentially three \nPCBs selected based on a common set of eligibility criteria and confirmed by the government; \n(ii) ADB does not lend directly to Ipak Yuli Bank for this project; the loan proceeds will be relent \nby  the  MOF  to  the  PCBs,  but  ADB  and  Ipak  Yuli  Bank  will  sign  a  project  agreement  on \nimplementation  matters;  and  (iii)  ADB  will  not  participate  as  a  shareholder,  and  the  ADB \nappointee on Ipak Yuli Bank\u2019s board will not participate as a board member, in any decision on \na transaction  involving  ADB. The  latter  is  based on  corporate governance requirements  of  the \nUzbek  joint  stock  company  legislation and recent  revisions  to the  Ipak  Yuli  Bank  charter.

Where  a  subborrower  borrows  more  than  one  subloan,  the  aggregate  value  of  the \nsubloans  will  have  a  ceiling  of  $100,000  equivalent.  PCBs  will  ensure  that  each  qualified \nsubborrower  meets  and  maintains  the  following  criteria:  a  debt-to-equity  ratio  not  higher  than \n75:25 for the project that the subloan is financing; a debt service coverage ratio not lower than \n1.1 times; and a proven credit track record and other criteria deemed necessary.  \n \n20. \nAt least 30% of the total number of loans made during the project life will be to women\u2019s \nsmall businesses (footnote 2); and at least 50% will be to small businesses outside the city of \nTashkent.  Subloans  to  women\u2019s  small  businesses  can  also  be  counted  as  subloans  for  rural \nsmall businesses provided that the qualified subborrowers are registered or located outside the \ncity of Tashkent. Subloans may be to either new or repeat subborrowers as long as they meet \nsubborrower  and  subproject  criteria.  The  PCBs  will  manage  their  foreign  exchange  and  credit \nrisks prudently by charging appropriate risk premiums, which will be factored into their onlending \nrates  for  subloans.24 PCBs  will  independently  assess  the  creditworthiness  of  borrowers  and \ndetermine commercial terms and conditions of loans. \n\n                                                \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Banks will charge market-based interest rates with due consideration to the real cost of funds.

After  the  PCB  eligibility  criteria  were  defined,  a \nselection  process  identified  potential  PCBs  from  among  all  banks.  Under  the  eligibility  criteria, \nPCBs must (i) meet ADB\u2018s requirements on financial analysis, financial management systems, \nand integrity due diligence; (ii) be willing and able to grow, design, and service women\u2019s small \nbusinesses and rural small businesses in line with the objectives of the project; (iii) comply with \nCBU  mandatory  prudential  standards,  and  AML/CFT  and  regulations  in  Uzbekistan;  and  (iv) \ncomply with covenants in other ADB projects and/or programs in which they are engaged. \n \n23. \nThe selection of potential PCBs was undertaken in three phases. In the first phase, ADB \ncompiled  key  financial  indicators  for  all  active  commercial  banks  in  Uzbekistan.  In  the  second \nphase, ADB identified 11 banks that were largely in compliance with financial benchmark ratios, \nand sent letters inviting them to confirm their interest  in participating in the project and provide \nfinancial  data  on  their  benchmark  ratios  as  well  as  their  branch  networks.  In  the  third  phase, \nseven banks were requested to submit additional information, including more detailed financial \ninformation.  During  fact-finding  on  20\u201328  May  2013,  five  banks  that  responded  to  the  request \nfor  additional  information  and  were  largely  in  compliance  with  the  benchmark  ratios  were \nreviewed  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements:  financial  analysis,  assessment  of  financial \nmanagement  systems,  and  integrity  due  diligence.  ADB  interviewed  the  five  banks  to  confirm \ntheir  commitment  to  the  project.  The  banks  provided  information  about  their  willingness  and \nability  to  grow  and  service  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  rural  small  businesses.  Two  banks \nmeet the eligibility criteria to participate in the project. One more PCB is expected to be added \nto the project provided it meets the eligibility criteria as stipulated under the project.  \n \nBased  on  audited  financial  statements  for  2012,  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  the \n24. \npotential PCBs was equal to or higher than 12%. Their return on average assets was equal to or \nhigher  than  1%.  Their  loan-to-deposit  ratio  was  under  100%;  their  cost-to-income  ratio  was \nunder 75%; their nonperforming loans did not exceed 5%; and the maximum amount of risk on \nloans given  to one insider  was not  greater than 25%.25 The  PCBs  will  be  required  to maintain \nthese  financial  performance  ratios  to  remain  eligible  intermediaries.26 The  CBU  has  confirmed \nthat  the  potential  PCBs  meet  CBU  mandatory  prudential  standards  as  well  as  AML/CFT  laws \nand  regulations  in  Uzbekistan,  including  applicable  CBU  regulations. 27  The  potential  PCBs \ncomply  with  covenants  in  other  ADB  projects  and/or  programs  in  which  they  are  engaged. 28 \nSubborrower  and  subproject  eligibility  criteria  are  designed  to  ensure  viability  and  continued \noperational and financial soundness.
