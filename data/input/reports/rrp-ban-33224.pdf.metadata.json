Specifically,  it  will  (i)  promote  small-scale \nagribusiness activities by channeling credit through reputable, experienced \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGO),  and  by  providing  technical  and \nmarketing support to small-scale agribusinesses throughout the rural areas \nof  the  country;  (ii)  strengthen  participating  NGOs  and  wholesale  banks  to \nensure  efficiency  of  the  credit  implementation  and  management;  (iii) \nstrengthen  agribusiness  associations  for  policy  dialogue  on  the  enabling \nenvironment,  agribusiness  promotion,  and  information  dissemination;  and \n(iv)  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  agribusiness  development \nthrough legislative and regulatory changes, as well as reorientation training \nfor the staff of public sector agencies. \n \nBangladesh  has  few  mineral  resources,  almost  no  forest  resources,  and \nsevere \nland  and  a \nhardworking  rural  population  are  among  the  country\u2019s  few  resources  and \nassets.  Thus,  future  economic  growth  will  require  stimulating  commercial \nactivities  within,  and  based  on,  the  agriculture  sector.  Since  almost  all \ncultivable land is in use, increased growth in the agriculture sector must be \nderived  from  (i)  diversification  of  agriculture  production  to  higher  value \ncrops;  (ii)  intensification  of  production  around  homestead  areas;  (iii) \nprovision  of  services  to  the  agriculture  sector  (upstream  links);  and  (iv) \nvalue  addition  through  further  processing,  storage,  and  transport  of \nfuture \nagricultural  commodities  (downstream \neconomic growth will require an expansion of agriculture-based enterprises \nor agribusiness. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  poverty  in  Bangladesh  through \nagribusiness  growth  that  generates  income  and  employment  in  the  rural \nareas.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  expanded  activities  of  rural \nenterprises  engaged  in  commercial  agriculture  production,  input  supply, \nmarketing, processing, and transportation. These will generate employment \nin rural and peri-urban areas, raise the value added of nontraditional crops \nand commodities, and increase rural incomes. \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nlimitations.

This will be undertaken \nwith the assistance of NGOs experienced in providing credit and support to \nrural enterprises at the grassroots level. The rural poor will be the ultimate \nbeneficiaries of these actions through enhanced employment opportunities, \nincome generation, and agricultural production. \n \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $60.0  million  equivalent,  comprising  a \nforeign exchange cost of $6.9 million equivalent and a local currency cost \nof $53.1 million equivalent. \n \n\n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange\n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nSubborrowers \nContracted Service Providers \n\n6.9 \n\n    0 \n     0 \n     0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n35.6 \n2.0 \n15.3 \n0.2 \n\n53.1 \n\nTotal \nCost \n42.5 \n2.0 \n15.3 \n0.2 \n\n60.0 \n\nPercent \n\n70.7 \n3.4 \n25.5 \n0.4 \n\n100.0 \n\n6.9 \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n \nThe  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  is  equivalent  in  various  currencies  to  Special \nDrawing Rights 28,910,000 ($42.5 million equivalent). The loan will have a \nmaturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest \nrate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nFor the agribusiness credit line, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will provide \nfunding to Bangladesh Small Industries and Commerce (BASIC) Bank and \nEastern Bank through subsidiary loan agreements on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  will  lend  to  the \nparticipating NGOs through onlending agreements on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. Participating NGOs will lend the loan funds to eligible \nsubborrowers at their usual market rate. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), MOF \n \n\n \n31 December 2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nv\n\nMOA  will  be  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  the  Project,  except  the \nagribusiness  credit  line,  which  will  be  the  responsibility  of  MOF.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Agricultural \nMarketing  (DAM)  to  carry  out  day-to-day  operations  of  the  Project.  MOF \nwill  be  responsible  for  managing  and  overseeing  the  agribusiness  credit \nline.  BASIC  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  and  participating  NGOs  will  implement \nthe credit line component. \n \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  related  services  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nfor  Procurement  (the  Guidelines).  The  procurement  of \nGuidelines \nequipment  and  machinery  by  small-scale  entrepreneurs  will  be \nin \naccordance  with  para.  3.08  of  the  Guidelines  (Purchase  of  Equipment  for \nthe  Use  of  Small  Private  Sub-borrowers).  A  few  vehicles  and  some  office \nequipment  for  PIU  will  be  procured,  though  no  large  purchases  are \nrequired.  Thus,  PIU  will  purchase  these  items  using  methods  specified  in \nPublic Procurement Regulation 2003, which are acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n \n \n\n \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  652  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nincluding  93  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  559 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  following  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  as  firms  under  three  packages  following \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures. \n \nThe  Project  is  to  stimulate  commercial  activities  in  the  agriculture  sector \nranging  from  preproduction  support  to  production  to  post-production \nhandling,  processing,  transport,  storage,  and  marketing.  An  expansion  of \nthese  activities  and  increases  in  the  value  added  to  agricultural  produce \nare  expected  to  generate  economic  growth  and  employment,  primarily  in \nthe  rural  areas.  A  review  of  sample  enterprises  shows  that  agribusiness \ninvestment \nis  profitable,  and  generates  substantial  and  permanent \nemployment. \n \nThe  cumulative  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  economy  also  will  be \nsignificant  through  direct  increases  in  production,  expanded  value  added, \nand employment generation. Economic benefits will include an increase in \nemployment  opportunities  of  about  70,000 \nindirect \neconomic  benefits  will  result  from  (i)  higher  production  generated  by  the \navailability  of  better  support  services;  (ii)  heightened  demand \nfor \nagricultural  produce  for  processing  and  urban  sales,  raising  producer \nprices and increasing quantities of produce marketed; and (iii) a multiplier \neffect  generated  through  greater  demands  for  on-farm  labor,  transport, \nstorage,  and  handling.  Disadvantaged  segments  of  the  rural  community, \nwhere 53% of the population lives in poverty, will benefit from the increased \nlabor  demand  and  increased  demand  for  farm  produce.  The  promotion  of \nintensive  agribusiness  activities  (such  as  dairy,  poultry  raising,  and  fish \nfarming), which do not require significant land, also will benefit these poor \nsegments directly. \n \n\njobs.  Additional \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\nNGOs  will  handle  the  majority  of  the  investment  under  the  Project  by \nproviding credit and support to small-scale agro-enterprises. Risks include \n(i)  increased  financial  risks  to  NGOs  due  to  the  larger  subloans  to  be \nprovided  to  each  borrower;  (ii)  increased  credit  risk  to  BASIC  Bank  and \nEastern  Bank  in  making  larger-than-normal  loans  to  NGOs,  and  (iii)  the \npossibility  that  NGOs  will  not  follow  sound  procedures  in  providing \nsubloans. \n \nThe increased financial risk to NGOs will be dealt with in three ways. First, \nonly NGOs with sound track records and a substantial financial base will be \nchosen. Second, the Project will provide substantial technical training and \nsupport  to  NGOs  and  the  borrowers.  Third,  by  focusing  on  subborrowers \nwho  have  experience  and  some  success  based  with  previous  microcredit \nborrowing  or  microenterprise  experience,  the  Project  will  select  low-risk, \nexperienced  clients.  The  increased  credit  risk  to  wholesale  banks  will  be \nhandled  by  following  prudent  practices,  including  (i)  increasing  loan  size \ndeliberately  and  steadily  based  on  repayment  performance  of  prior \ntranches,  coupled  with  initial  short-term  lending  followed  by  longer  terms \nbased on proven performance; (ii) limiting credit exposure to any one NGO \nborrower  to  less  than  15%  of  the  net  worth  through  the  use  of  two \nwholesale  banks;  and  (iii)  viewing  all  assets  and  liabilities  of  each  NGO \nborrower  and  expected  operating  surpluses,  rather  than  considering  only \nproject-related  activities.  This  latter  practice  will  be  linked  to  a  set  of \nindicators  (and  action  triggers)  to  keep  the  mix  of  assets  and  liabilities \nbalanced.  To  address  the  risk  of  NGOs  not  following  sound  procedures, \nPIU  will  undertake  a  strong  project  performance  management  system, \ncomplemented by the wholesale banks\u2019 rigorous review of loan applications \nfrom the NGOs and the performance of their loan portfolios. \n \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  of  $600,000  equivalent,  financed  from  TA \nSpecial  Fund,  is  to  assist  MOA  and  DAM  in  establishing  a  project \nsupervisory  and  monitoring  capacity  in  DAM.  The  TA  also  will  guide  and \nadvise  DAM  and  PIU  personnel  in  agribusiness  promotion  and  project \nmanagement. The aim is to set the stage for an expansion of agribusiness \nactivities  in the  future  by  establishing  a  focal  point  within  the  Government \nfor agribusiness promotion. \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Bangladesh  for  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project  (the  Project).1,2  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Project Management, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  economy  of  Bangladesh  has  a  large  rural  population  engaged  in  agriculture  on \nincreasingly  fragmented  landholdings.  Given  the  country\u2019s  extensive  landlessness  and  almost \ntotal  dependence  on  agriculture  as  a  source  of  raw  materials,  Bangladesh  must  look  to \nagribusiness development as a generator of employment, as well as a means of adding value to \nits  main  economic  resources.  The  agribusiness  sector  covers  (i)  commercial  production3  of \nagricultural  commodities,  including  crops,  livestock,  fisheries,  and  forestry;  (ii)  processing  of \nagricultural commodities into products; (iii) provision of inputs for the production of agricultural \ncommodities, including planting and genetic material, agro-chemicals, and equipment; and (iv) \nstorage,  marketing,  and  distribution  of  agricultural  commodities  and  products.  Expanding \nagribusiness  and  increasing  business  opportunities  in  rural  areas  could  create  an  important \nsource  of  employment  for  a  labor  force  that  grows  by  about  2  million  people  each  year.  The \noverwhelming majority of employment generated by agribusinesses is in rural areas, where 53% \nof the population lives in poverty. \n \n3. \nDemand-driven  agribusiness  activities  are  critically  important  to  the  Bangladesh \neconomy. Agribusiness accounts for about 10% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), \naccording to estimates.4 Because the market demand is income-elastic (para. 5), the growth of \nagribusiness  is  much  higher  than  the  growth  of  agricultural  production.  While  agricultural \nproduction grew by about 37% during the 1990s, agribusiness grew by about 66%\u2014or roughly \n5.2% annually over a decade. The growth of agribusiness, though faster than the 3.2% annual \nexpansion  in  agriculture  in  that  period,  still  was  insufficient  to  generate  the  employment  and \nincome growth required to reduce poverty significantly and accelerate the overall growth of the \nrural  economy.  With  proper  support,  however,  agribusiness  growth  could  accelerate  to  an \nestimated  7%  a  year  or  more,  which  would  speed  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Potential \n\n \n4. \nBangladesh  has  few  mineral  resources,  almost  no  forest  resources,  and  severe \ninfrastructure  and  location  limitations.  Productive  agricultural  land  and  a  hardworking  rural \npopulation are among the country\u2019s main resources and assets. Thus, future growth will require \nstimulating  commercial,  value-adding  activities  within,  and  based  on,  the  agriculture  sector  to \ngenerate the employment needed to help pull the bulk of the country\u2019s population out of poverty. \n\n                                                 \n1  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  was  provided.

Bangladesh  offers  opportunities  for  agribusiness  growth,  because  of \nits  comparative  advantage  in  producing  a  range  of  agricultural  commodities5  and  the  growing \ndemand for a variety of quality, convenient, and high-value products. In the 1990s, the country \nachieved  rice  self-sufficiency.  Increased  food  security  has  created  greater  opportunities  for \nagricultural  and  nonfarm  diversification.  Growth  of  the  economy  has  increased  purchasing \npower, especially in urban areas, with the consequent rise in demand for nonstaple foods and \nmore processed items.6 The domestic market for safer, higher-quality, and more convenient and \nprocessed foods is potentially large. \n \nSmall-Scale and Agro-Based. A notable feature of Bangladesh\u2019s agribusiness sector is \n6. \nthe  dominance  of  small-scale  units  in  production,  processing,  and  distribution.  The  National \nPrivate  Sector  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Bangladesh7  (NPSSEB)  reflects  the  overwhelming \npreponderance of small enterprises with less than 10 employees. Of the 6 million micro-, small, \nand medium enterprises (100 or fewer employees) in Bangladesh employing approximately 31 \nmillion people,8 90% have less than 10 workers, and 36% have only one worker. About 48% of \nthe  small  enterprises  (10  or  fewer  employees)  are  engaged  in  commercial  agriculture;  or \nprovide  forward  and  backward  links  through  the  supply  of  inputs  and  the  processing,  storage, \nand transport of agricultural produce. About 2.6 million small-scale agribusinesses are scattered \nthroughout Bangladesh, and this number is growing 5.1% annually.9 \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policies \n\n \n7. \nMarket  reforms  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  provided  a  policy  framework  that  was \nincreasingly  supportive  of  private  sector  involvement  in  agribusiness,  which  the  public  sector \npreviously  had  controlled.  This  included  private  sector  distribution  of  agricultural  inputs  and \nexports.  The  National  Agriculture  Policy  199910  strongly  emphasized  the  commercialization  of \nagriculture. Key proposals for developing an enabling environment for agribusiness included (i) \npromoting  a  competitive  market  with  easy  access  for  private  sector  traders,  processors,  and \nexporters  to  supply  inputs  and  purchase  outputs;  (ii)  ensuring  comparable  conditions  for  the \nGovernment, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the private sector; and (iii) monitoring \nand enforcing laws and regulations. \n \nDespite the encouraging policies for agribusiness development, few concrete measures \n8. \nhave  been  taken  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  in  which  agribusinesses  operate.  The \npolicies  lack  consistency  in  defining  the  key  objectives  and  strategies  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment. Policies often are established in very general terms, while the details needed to \nmake a policy effective (e.g., specifying responsibilities and mechanisms of implementation) are \noften  missing.  Confusion  about  regulations  affects  the  users,  as  well  as  the  authorities \nresponsible for enforcing them. \n \nThe  Government  lacks  a  focal  point  for  agribusiness  promotion.  Agribusiness  involves \n9. \ncrosscutting issues related to production, commerce, and industry. However, the organization of \nministries in Bangladesh is fragmented, which constrains the formulation and implementation of \ncrosscutting policies. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock \n                                                 \n5   Agricultural  commodities  with  comparative  advantage  and  export  potential  include  shrimp,  fish,  jute,  tea, \nvegetables and fruits (fresh and processed), herbs and spices, and medicinal plants (Supplementary Appendix A). \n6   Demand  estimates  indicate  that  income  elasticities  are  much  higher  for  almost  all  of  non-cereal  agricultural \n\nproducts than for staple crops, particularly for fruits, vegetables, livestock, and fish (Appendix 2). \n\n7   Daniels, Lisa. 2003.

Dhaka. \n\n\f(MOFL)  are  involved  mainly  in  production  issues  at  the  farm  level.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce \nlooks  mainly  at  trade  issues,  while  the  Ministry  of  Industry  focuses  on  industry  issues.  In  the \nabsence  of  a  lead  agency  responsible  for  agribusiness,  the  coordination  needed  for  efficient \ndevelopment of this sector is difficult to achieve. \n \n10.  Most of the work of public sector line agencies associated with the agriculture sector is \nproduction-oriented. As such, most staff of these agencies do not understand the importance of \ndownstream and upstream links, or the need to add value to primary produce. The Department \nof  Agricultural  Marketing  (DAM)  of  MOA  is  the  agency  with  the  closest  mandate  to  promote \nagribusiness. DAM has focused mainly on providing price information, collecting market levies, \nand  registering  traders.  However,  MOA  wants  to  enhance  DAM\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  broader \nservices for market-led commercial agriculture development. \n \n\n3. \n\nRural Finance \n\n \n11. \nA  critical  constraint  facing  agribusiness  entrepreneurs  is  their  difficulty  in  mobilizing \nfinance. NPSSEB, which indicated that most enterprises are small-scale and agro-based (para. \n6), found that half identified availability of finance as the most important problem when starting \nup  and  during  operations.  Small-scale  agribusinesses  constitute  a  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d11  market \nthat is underserved by the commercial banking system and the country\u2019s microfinance NGOs. \n \n12. \nTwo development finance institutions (DFI), Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi \nUnnayan Bank, and nationalized commercial banks (NCB) handle most of the agricultural credit. \nThe bulk of this is for crop finance, with relatively little lending to rural agribusinesses. DFIs and \nNCBs are insolvent, failing to meet the prudential requirements set by Bangladesh Bank. They \ncharge an artificially low interest rate, which is below cost on agricultural loans, and have a poor \nrecovery  rate.  Moreover,  the  programs  for  rural  credit  channeled  through  DFIs  and  NCBs  are \nunable  to  meet  the  growing  demand  from  rural  enterprises  for  a  broader  range  of  financial \nservices.  Rural  deposits  flow  into  urban  credit,  which  undermines  the  business  climate  in  the \ncountry, as well as the availability of inputs and technology for rural enterprises. \n \n13. \nIn contrast, a few private commercial banks (PCB) charge higher interest rates, have a \nbetter  loan  recovery  rate,  and  maintain  a  healthy  debt-equity  financial  structure  needed  for \nbalanced  growth.  These  institutions  are  viable  and  sustainable.  Unlike  DFIs  and  NCBs, \nhowever, PCBs lack rural coverage and are not interested in providing the small loans that most \nof  Bangladesh\u2019s  agribusinesses  require.  Moreover,  potential  small-scale  investors  usually  lack \nthe  collateral  that  PCBs  require  to  secure  a  loan,  and  cannot  deal  with  the  complex  loan \napplication  procedures.  NPSSEB  data  suggest  that  less  than  15%  of  enterprises  received \nformal credit from commercial banks. \n \nLike  the  better  PCBs,  many  of  the  country's  larger  NGOs  that  have  developed  loan \n14. \nportfolios  for  more  than  5  years  with  financial  and  technical  assistance  from  Palli  Karma-\nSahayak Foundation (PKSF) are well-managed, and have demonstrated their sustainability. In \naddition to microcredit, they provide a wide range of group and community training, as well as \nsupport services. However, NGOs generally have targeted the poorest rural groups, and would \nhave  difficulty  mobilizing  funds  for  small-scale  commercial  and  agribusiness  lending.  Apex \nfunding  agency  PKSF,  the  main  source  of  funds  for  NGOs,  has  funded  only  programs  that \nprovide poverty-targeted microloans of less than $500 each. NGOs interested in providing larger \nloans  to  commercial  enterprises  have  had  to  find  funding  elsewhere,  either  from  their  own \n\n                                                 \n11  As  discussed  in  paras.  12-14,  the  investment  of  small-scale  agribusinesses  requires  higher  amount  of  financing \n\nthan the microcredit provisions from NGOs, but is considered too small and risky by the commercial banks. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nearnings or from commercial loans from banks. Since NGOs cannot provide large  amounts of \ncollateral, the latter option is limited. \n \n15. \nIn  recent  years,  recognizing  the  potential  for  their  successful  microcredit  clients  to \nexpand their operations to a commercial level, some experienced and reputable NGOs began to \nprovide support to small rural enterprises. BRAC, which began lending to entrepreneurs through \nits  progoti  (\u201cprogress\u201d)  program  in  1997,  has  extended  $164.0  million  equivalent  to  140,000 \nenterprises. The Association for Social Advancement (ASA) will disburse $8.0 million this year \nto  about  12,000  enterprises  through  its  small  enterprise  loan  program.  In  2002,  Thengamara \nMohila  Sabuj  Sangha  (TMSS)  initiated  its  own  microenterprise  loan  program,  which  has  an \noutstanding portfolio of $2.0 million to about 2,000 borrowers. Microfinance institutions (MFI) are \nkeen to scale up lending to microenterprises that are capable of expanding their operations, if \nsuitable financing and business support is available. \n \n\n4. \n\nConstraints to Efficient Marketing and Technology Transfer \n\n \nThe  country\u2019s  poor  infrastructure  is  another  key  constraint  to  agribusiness  growth.  The \n16. \nproblems include (i) poor road, rail, and water transport connections; (ii) inadequate and poorly \nmaintained  markets;  (iii)  lack  of  electricity  connections  (only  about  30%  of  rural  households \nhave electricity, and the supply is unpredictable); (iv) poor port and airport facilities, which limit \naccess  to  export  markets;  and  (v)  lack  of  storage  facilities.  Planned  and  ongoing  projects  on \nrural  infrastructure  and  rural  electrification  are  addressing  many  of  these  constraints.  Still, \ninfrastructure constraints to agribusiness expansion remain significant. Moreover, deficiencies in \nthe management and operation and maintenance of markets prevent the available infrastructure \nfrom being used optimally. \n \n17. \nA further constraint is the widespread lack of awareness of technologies for agribusiness \ndevelopment.  For  example,  the  handling  and  packaging  of  agricultural  commodities  are \nunderdeveloped,  resulting  in  considerable  losses  in  quantity  and  quality.  Few  traders  and \nprocessors, and even fewer farmers, use contractual arrangements for the sale or purchase of \nagricultural  commodities.  Most  entrepreneurs  do  not  use  the  information  available  through \nmedia, publications, and the internet due to lack of awareness, capacity, or initiative. Although \nawareness campaigns about new technologies exist, they are infrequent and often do not reach \nareas outside major cities. \n \n18. \nThe  dissemination  of  agricultural  technologies  by  public  organizations  is  still  largely \nfocused on self-sufficiency targets and increasing staple crop yields at the farm level. It does not \nseek to improve post-harvest technologies, management systems, and processing technologies \nthat  could  enhance  competitiveness  and  add  value.  While  research  and  extension  programs \nfocus on improving traditional smallholder systems of crop and animal production, they largely \nignore the agribusiness dimensions. The design of research and extension programs does not \nemphasize sufficiently the link between farmers and markets. \n \n\n5. \n\nOpportunities for Project Support \n\n \n19. \nReaching  rural  enterprises  and  providing  them  with  support  and  encouragement  to \nexpand  is  difficult.  No  agency  in  the  Government  is  tasked  specifically  with  agribusiness \npromotion  (paras.  9\u201310).  Small  rural  enterprises  constitute  a  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  market  that  is \ninadequately  served  by  the  formal financial  system  (paras.  11\u201314).  Nonetheless,  considerable \nopportunities for project support is provided by (i) the market demand for agribusiness products; \n(ii) the existence of a sustainable microfinance sector with the capacity and interest in scaling up \nits  lending;  and  (iii)  the  country\u2019s  well-established  NGOs  that  provide  a  wide  range  of  client \n\n\fsupport  services,  in  addition  to  credit.  The  uniformly  small-scale  and  labor-intensive  rural \nenterprises  provide  the  opportunity  for  broadly  based,  pro-poor  growth.  Finally,  the  country\u2019s \nnascent  private  agribusiness  trade  associations,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  willingness  to \nconsider  policy  reforms \nto  support  agribusiness  and  small,  private  sector  enterprise \ndevelopment, offer further scope for project support. \n \n20.  Meeting  the  Unmet  Rural  Finance  Demand.  The  Project  must  address  the  strong \nunmet demand for financial services from existing and potential enterprises. Few formal means \nfor  these  agribusinesses  to  access  finance  are  available  (paras.  12\u201313).  The  NPSSEB  found \nthat 39% of the 2.6 million small-scale agribusinesses (or about 1 million enterprises) would like \nto  get  credit  support,  and  are  confident  about  paying  it  back.12  Most  of  the  credit  demand  is \nestimated to be for loans of $500\u2013$5,000. If small-scale agribusiness need on average $2,500 \nequivalent for short-term investment and operations, the total unmet credit demand would be far \nmore than any project can offer. \n \n21.  Working  Through  Experienced  NGOs  with  Grassroots  Contacts.  NGOs  are  a \nstrategic entry point for the Project. Throughout the rural areas in Bangladesh, NGOs, especially \nthe large ones, have significantly greater representation than commercial banks. They also have \nclose  links  with  farmers  and  rural  entrepreneurs.  Experienced  and  reputable  NGOs,  which \npreviously  have  focused  their  development  on  nonagriculture  activities,  increasingly  are \ninvolved  with  agriculture-based  activities,  as  well  as  with  producers  and \nbecoming \nentrepreneurs\u2014individually and in groups\u2014above the microcredit level. This change of focus is \nreflected by such initiatives as BRAC\u2019s progoti program, ASA\u2019s small enterprise loan program, \nand  TMSS\u2019s  microenterprise  program  (para.  15).  These  three  programs,  in  particular, \nspecifically  target  enterprises  larger  than  those  at  the  traditional  microfinance  level.  However, \nthese enterprises are smaller than those that PCBs lend to. \n \n22. \nStrengthening  Agribusiness  Associations  for  Policy  Dialogue  and  Technology \nDissemination.  The  many  agribusiness-related  associations  in  Bangladesh  provide  an \nopportunity for partnership with the Project. With varying degrees of success, these associations \nhave lobbied and engaged in business promotion. They have been less successful, however, in \nproviding  other  services  to  their  members,  particularly  in  marketing  and  market-promotion.  If \nstrengthened and properly organized and managed, the associations can be an important tool \nfor industry development, as they represent one of the more important links in the agribusiness \nvalue  chain.  For  the  Project,  the  associations  can  represent  the  interests  of  private  sector \nentrepreneurs  of  all  sizes  in  policy  dialogue  on  the  enabling  environment  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment  and  rural  finance.  In  addition,  they  can  disseminate  information  and  technical \nadvice among their members, as well as among NGOs and their borrowers. \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  be  the  largest  in  Bangladesh  directly  focused  on  agribusiness.  Of  the \nprojects  relevant  to  agribusiness  (Appendix  3),  the  most  notable  examples  are  the  two  agro-\nbased  technology  development  projects  (ATDP)  funded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development. ATDPs facilitated the emergence of new agribusiness ventures and \nstrengthened existing ones. ATDPs also formed many commodity-based associations, most of \nwhich  are  still  functioning.  With  its  much  larger  coverage,  the  Project  will  disseminate  the \nATDPs\u2019  success \ntheir \ncompetitiveness. \n \n\nin  promoting  privately  owned  agribusinesses  and  enhancing \n\n                                                 \n12 An additional 20% need credit, but are concerned about not being able to pay it back. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n24. \nEarlier and ongoing projects assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \naid  agencies  confirm  the  value  of  working  through  credit-based  project  lending  to  reach  the \nagriculture  sector  and  agribusiness.  Further,  working  with  and  through  NGOs  in  Bangladesh \ngenerally  has  been  very  successful.  Such  projects  include  the  first  and  second  Participatory \nLivestock Development Projects 13 and the Northwest Crop Diversification Project (NCDP).14 By \nthe  midterm  review  in  2004,  NCDP  had  provided  crop  production  credit  through  NGOs  to \nfarmers,  with  repayment  of  credit  at  about  100%.  However,  the  progress  of  the  NCDP  pilot \nagribusiness credit line channeled through one NCB, Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, has been \nslow  due  to  the  bank\u2019s  requirements  that  farmers  provide  collateral  and  possess  landed \nproperty.  The  NCDP  experience  validates  the  use  of  reputable  NGOs,  rather  than  NCBs,  to \nchannel credit to the small-scale agribusinesses. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  complement  directly  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SMESDP),15  and  benefit  from  the  SME  policy  reform.  SMESDP  is  to \nlend  to  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  through  PCBs.  However,  because  of  the \nrestrictions  on  PCB  lending  (para.  13),  most  agribusinesses  will  be  unable  to  borrow  from \nSMESDP.  By  focusing  on  small-scale  enterprises  in  rural  areas,  many  of  which  lack  the \ncollateral that PCBs require, the Project will help the clients that SMESDP cannot reach. \n \n26. \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  poverty  reduction  strategies  of  the  Government  and \nADB,  which  recognize  that  the  development  of  viable  agribusinesses  is  essential  to  poverty \nreduction  in  rural  areas.  The  National  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth,  Poverty  Reduction  and \nSocial Development16 states that \u201cthe rapid growth of agriculture would require agroprocessing \nand  agribusiness  development  to  facilitate  access  of  farmers  to  modern  inputs  and  ensure \nincreased demand for agriculture products.\u201d The ADB Country Strategy and Program17 stresses \nthe need to \u201ctransform agriculture from a subsistence to a commercial orientation and promote \nagribusiness  development\u201d  as  a  means  to  \u201cimprove  the  livelihood  of  76%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation  (and  85%  of  the  poor).\u201d  To  foster  a  vibrant  and  diversified  rural  economy,  ADB \nassistance will contribute to (i) intensification, diversification, and value addition of the crops to \nboost  agricultural  productivity,  improve  food  security,  and  foster  rural  enterprise  development; \n(ii) strengthened farm-to-market links; and (iii) sustained growth of agriculture and agribusiness, \nwhich generate productive on-farm and off-farm employment to raise rural incomes. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n27. \nThe design of the Project takes into consideration lessons learned from ADB and other \naid agencies\u2019 projects in the agriculture, micro and rural finance, horticulture, aquaculture, and \nlivestock sectors in Bangladesh and other countries. The key lessons learned are: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  sustainable  development  of  horticulture  (agribusiness)  depends  heavily  on \nprivate  sector  participation.  Although  the  potential  for  horticulture  (agribusiness) \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1997.

While  market  liberalization \nhas  increased  private  demand  for  commercial  credit,  commercial  banks  are \nunprepared to serve the emerging needs of agriculture.19  \nThe  performance  of  public  banks  catering  to  rural  areas  has  been  poor.  In \ncontrast, the outreach of the MFIs and microcredit programs of NGOs has grown \nconsiderably. But they still need strengthening and support to meet the need of \nan important segment of rural entrepreneurs, i.e., the middles (footnote 11).20  \nChanneling  a  credit  line  requires  a  rigorous  examination  of  the  capacity  of  the \nparticipating  banks  and  NGOs  to  act  as  effective  financial  intermediaries.  The \ncredit  line  should  provide  flexibility  to  participating  banks  and  NGOs  in  setting \ntheir  interest  rates  to  reflect  credit  risks  of  the  respective  clients.  Further, \nrecycling should be monitored to prevent the use of the credit facility for purposes \nother than those intended by the Project.21  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  poverty  in  Bangladesh  through  agribusiness \n28. \ngrowth that generates income and employment in rural areas. The outcome of the Project will \nbe expanded activities of rural enterprises engaged in commercial agriculture production, input \nsupply, marketing, processing, and transportation.  These will generate employment in rural and \nperi-urban  areas,  increase  the  value  added  of  nontraditional  crops  and  commodities,  and \nincrease  rural  incomes.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  target  small-scale  agribusinesses  that  do \nnot  have  the  wherewithal  to  mobilize  the  financing  they  require  to  expand,  or  the  capacity  to \nopen  up  new  downstream  markets.  This  will  be  undertaken  with  the  assistance  of  NGOs \nexperienced in providing credit and support to rural enterprises at the grassroots level. The rural \npoor  will  be  the  ultimate  beneficiaries  of  all  of  these  actions  through  enhanced  employment \nopportunities, income generation, and agricultural production. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \nThe  Project  outputs  include  (i)  establishment,  expansion,  and  successful  operation  of \nagribusinesses  by  small-scale  entrepreneurs;  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  of  participating  NGOs \nand  wholesale  banks  in  agribusiness  lending;  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  of  agribusiness \nassociations in policy dialogue and agribusiness information and technology dissemination; and \n(iv)  improved  policy  environment  enabling  private  sector  participation.  The  outputs  will  be \ndelivered through the following components. \n \n\n1. \n\nCredit for Small-Scale Agribusinesses \n\n \nThis  component  is  designed  to  capture  the  economic  potential  of  the  small-scale \n30. \nenterprises  that  make  up  the  overwhelming  majority  of  agribusinesses  in  the  country.  The \nProject  will  provide  about  28,000  small-scale  agribusinesses  with  credit  through  participating \nreputable  NGOs.  The  total  credit  line  is  $36  million.  Each  enterprise  will  determine  its \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2001. Project Completion Report on the Horticulture Development Project in Bangladesh.

Subloans  will \nusually be $500\u2013$5,000 equivalent each, with terms of 6 months to 3 years for working capital \nand  fixed  asset  purchases.  The  Project  will  provide  up  to  70%  of  the  envisaged  cost  of  the \ninvestment,  with  the  subborrower  providing  the  balance  (i.e.,  30%  or  more).  Activities  to  be \nfinanced will include (i) the provision of upstream agribusiness services, such as the provision \nand  servicing  of  agriculture  equipment  or  the  sale  of  inputs  (seed,  seedlings,  saplings, \nfingerlings,  chicks,  calves,  and  fertilizers);  (ii)  downstream  activities,  such  as  the  collection, \nstorage,  processing,  and  transport  of  agricultural  produce;  and  (iii)  high-value  commercial \nproduction itself, especially for nontraditional commodities. \n \n31. \nBeneficiary entrepreneurs will include those who have participated successfully in NGO-\nsponsored microcredit programs and would like to scale up their activities to a more commercial \nlevel.  Their  microcredit  activities  provided  these  individuals  with  experience  in  commercial \nproduction  and/or  processing.  They  also  have  proven  their  entrepreneurial  skills  by  operating \nsuccessfully  microventures,  and  meeting  all  loan  repayment  obligations.  Many  would  like  to \naccess  to  larger  amounts  of  financing  to  increase  the  scale  of  their  economic  activities.  They \nalready  have  links  with NGOs  that can  attest  to  their skills  and  creditworthiness, and  thus  are \nprepared  to  lend  to  them  for  scaling  up.  However,  the  programs  are  not  limited  to  former \nmicrocredit borrowers and can accommodate any potential small-scale entrepreneurs who meet \nthe NGO\u2019s appraisal criteria. \n \n32. \nThe participating NGOs and wholesale banks must meet the eligibility criteria specified \nin  Appendix  4.  Bangladesh  Small  Industries  and  Commerce  (BASIC)  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank \nhave  been  identified  as  the  wholesalers,  because  they  (i)  are  financially  sound,  (ii)  have  a \nsatisfactory return on equity and on total assets, and (iii) have low administration costs on their \nlending. The larger subloans that will be provided to each subborrower will increase the financial \nrisks to NGOs, which had concentrated on traditional microfinance loans. To reduce these risks, \nthe Project will begin with three large- and medium-scale NGOs: BRAC, ASA, and TMSS.22 \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical and Marketing Support for Agribusinesses \n\n \nThis  component  aims  to  (i)  provide  technical  and  marketing  assistance  to  the  project \n33. \nsubborrowers  to  ensure  that  small-scale  entrepreneurs  successfully  operate  and  market  their \nagribusinesses;  and  (ii)  promote  agribusiness  in  general,  as  well  as  specifically  promote \nsynergistic interaction among the service providers involved in agribusiness. \n \n\na. \n\nTraining and Support for Small Entrepreneurs \n\n \n34. \nThe participating NGOs will provide the subborrowers with services normally provided in \ntheir small enterprise lending programs. The NGO support will include training and guidance in \nbusiness  planning,  small  business  financial  control  and  reporting,  and  credit  management.  In \naddition,  the  NGOs  will  provide  technical  training  in  (i)  livestock  management  and  health;  (ii) \nprocessing;  (iii)  product  storage  and  transport;  (iv)  fisheries;  (v)  agronomy;  (vi)  marketing  of \nhigh-value crops, such as fresh fruit, vegetables, and flowers; and (vii) nursery management. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  also  will  provide  direct  technical  and  marketing  support  to  agribusiness \nentrepreneurs  through  an  array  of  services  that  will  (i)  identify  agribusiness  opportunities \ninvolving  large  numbers  of  entrepreneurs  through  reviews  of  subsectors  and  NGO  borrower \n\n                                                 \n22 Due diligence reports on the participating NGOs and wholesale banks, prepared following the ADB\u2019s Operational \n\nManual on Financial Intermediation Loans, are in supplementary Appendixes C\u2013G. \n\n\fprofiles;  (ii)  assist  the  formation  of  producer  groups  and  associations  to  improve  production \noutput,  timing,  quality,  and  sales;  (iii)  facilitate  and  promote  private  sector  links  between \nentrepreneurs at each level of the value chain; (iv) hire specialists to provide technical expertise, \nas  required,  to  clusters  of  similar  entrepreneurs;  and  (v)  arrange  field  trips  to  lead  farmers, \nagribusinesses, and NGO staff. \n \n36. \nSmall-scale  women  entrepreneurs,  who  have  demonstrated  basic  enterprise \nmanagement skills and profitability, will receive special attention. They could play a vital role in \nlinking producers, especially those supported by NGOs, with consumer markets. Guided by an \ninternational  gender  advisor  and  a  domestic  women\u2019s  entrepreneur  promotion  specialist,  the \nProject  will  help  (i)  identify  opportunities  for  developing  commercial  links  with  producers,  (ii) \nadvise  on  packaging  and  market  promotion,  (iii)  develop  bankable  business  plans,  and  (iv) \nidentify  institutional  sources  of  finance.  As  a  result,  the  women  entrepreneurs  will  be  able  to \nmarket and access raw materials on a regular basis and expand their businesses. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening of Agribusiness Associations \n\n \n37. \nAgribusiness  associations  are  playing  a  key  role  in  the  promotion  of  agribusiness  in \nBangladesh  (para.  22).  To  help  build  up  their  capacities  to  provide  effective  services  to  their \nmembers  and  to  agribusiness  entrepreneurs  in  general,  the  Project  will  provide  training, \nworkshops, and domestic study tours on a cost-sharing basis. The Project will provide two thirds \nof  the  financing,  while  the  associations  will  cover  one  third.  The  participants  in  this \nsubcomponent  will  be  selected  on  proposals  submitted  by  the  associations  to  improve  their \ncapacity  based  on  a  commitment  to  delivering  reciprocal  services  to  their  members  and \nagribusiness entrepreneurs. \n \n\nc. \n\nAgribusiness Information and Technology Dissemination \n\n \nThis  subcomponent  will  consist  of  publicity  drives,  trade  fairs,  seminars,  and  other \n38. \nawareness-raising  and  TA  activities  that  will  (i)  inform  stakeholders  of  income-earning \nopportunities  in  agribusiness;  (ii)  disseminate  agribusiness  technologies;  (iii)  bring  together \ndiverse stakeholders in agribusiness, including private sector, NGOs, and relevant line agencies \nand research bodies; and (iv) provide a venue for the promotion of the Project. Dissemination \nand TA activities will be selected based on proposals made by parties interested in promoting \nagribusiness.  They  will  be  contracted  on  a  cost-sharing  basis,  with  the  Project  financing  two \nthirds and the service providers financing one third. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Capacity of Participating NGOs and Wholesale Banks in \nAgribusiness Lending \n\n \nThe  Project  will  help  participating  NGOs  (i)  improve  business  plans  with  a  focus  on \n39. \nfinancing and supporting small-scale agribusinesses; (ii) strengthen their institutional capability \nin  accessing  and  managing  funds  for  agribusiness  lending;  (iii)  enhance  their  management  of \nthe agribusiness loan portfolio and associated risks; and (iv) scale up their system of technical \nsupport to become more relevant to project-intended subborrowers. NGO staff will be trained to \nimprove  their  capabilities  on  agribusiness  promotion,  loan  appraisal  (including  assessing \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  supported  small-scale  enterprises),  loan  review,  and \nmanagement. The Project will strengthen the participating NGOs in preparing and delivering the \nsupporting  services  to  subborrowers  (para.  34)  through  workshops  for  NGO  staff  (training  of \ntrainers  and  senior  staff)  on  ways  to  commercialize  agriculture  and  improve  value  chain  links; \nand  reviews  of  NGO  facilities  devoted  to  technical  support,  as  well  as  recommendations  and \nfinancial support for scaling up these facilities for a more commercial and project-relevant focus. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n40. \nLoan  recovery  will  be  monitored  continually.  Monitoring  and  reporting  systems  will  be \ninstalled  in  each  participating  NGO  to  track  project  inputs  and  outputs,  and  to  provide  key \nperformance  indicators.  Indicators  to  be  monitored  include  (i)  type  of  agribusiness  being \nfinanced; (ii) amount of total investment, and lending by amount and terms provided under the \nProject to each subborrower; (iii) amount of agribusiness lending of the NGO as a proportion of \nits loan portfolio; (iv) number of borrowers financed through the Project; and (v) classification of \nthe  project-financed  agribusiness  loan  portfolio  in  comparison  with  the  total  loan  portfolio. \nInformation  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  These  indicators  will  complement  the  social  and \nfinancial indicators that NGOs, PKSF, and Bangladesh Bank already monitor. The Project also \nwill conduct sample checks of subborrowers to ensure that agribusiness is being financed, and \nthat funds are not being diverted. \n \n41. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  capacity  of  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  in  managing \nNGO loan portfolios, while increasing their knowledge of agribusiness lending opportunities and \nmanagement  of  associated  risks.  The  Project  will  work  with  these  banks  to  develop  new \nguidelines and procedures, or streamline the existing ones, for evaluating and processing NGO \nproposals and administering commercial loans to NGOs. It also will establish performance and \nbenefit indicators, and a process for monitoring these regularly through NGOs. \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving the Enabling Environment for Agribusiness \n\nThis  component  is  to  help  in  removing  inefficiencies  in  the  policy  environment,  and  to \n\n \n42. \nmake entry into agribusiness more attractive for private sector entrepreneurs. \n \n\na. \n\nIdentifying and Correcting Major Policy Constraints \n\n \n43. \nThe  Project  will  assist  MOA  and  other  relevant  government  agencies  in  (i)  identifying \nregulatory impediments to private sector operations in agribusiness; (ii) conducting workshops, \nseminars,  conferences,  and  consultations  with  public  and  private  sectors  on  required  policy \nchanges; and (iii) redrafting key regulations and legislative acts, as necessary. These activities \nwill be transparent and public. \n \nTo  encourage  improved  management  of  market  infrastructure  and  wholesale  centers, \n44. \nincluding expanded private sector roles and reinvestment of market income in improving market \nfacilities, the Project also will (i) assess public market management and revenue distribution, (ii) \nassess  the  results  of  NCDP  pilot  market  improvement  efforts,  and  (iii)  assist  MOA  in  making \nnecessary changes. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Public Sector Agencies in Agribusiness Governance, \nSupport, and Promotion \n\n \n45. \nTo  enhance  understanding  of  agribusiness,  the  Project  will  prepare,  implement,  and \nfinance training programs on agribusiness to orient personnel of the relevant public sector line \nagencies (MOA, MOFL, others) to the characteristics and needs of this relatively new sectoral \nemphasis. The training courses will provide an overview of agribusiness in the country and its \nopportunities,  and  also  introduce  public  service  personnel  to  representatives  of  the  private \nsector and NGOs operating in agribusiness.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\n \n46. \nA project implementation unit (PIU) will provide implementation support. This will consist \nof physical facilities, staff, transport, and consulting services required for project activities on (i) \n\n\ftechnical  and  marketing  support  to  subborrowers;  (ii)  agribusiness  promotion;  (iii)  training;  (iv) \naccounting; (v) monitoring and evaluation; and (vi) liaising where necessary with BASIC Bank, \nEastern Bank, and NGOs. MOA will set up and staff a permanent agribusiness cell, which will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  developing  agribusiness  policy  and  regulations;  (ii)  guiding  agribusiness \noperations; and (iii) liaising with other ministries, PIU, and ADB. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n47. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  the  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  of  small-scale  rural  entrepreneurs,  a  key \ngroup  with  substantial  economic  growth  potential  that  has  been  underserved  by  the  rural \nfinancial  system  and  by  most  aid  agency-financed  projects  in  Bangladesh.  Agribusiness \ninvestments undertaken by these small-scale enterprises are expected to generate substantial \ndirect employment opportunities and increase the demand for agricultural products. In turn, this \nwill translate into demand for a broader range of produce, higher prices, additional employment, \nand  increased  rural  incomes.  The  Project  also  will  focus  on  working  with  the  key  public  and \nprivate sector agencies to improve the enabling environment for agribusiness activities, thereby \nstimulating increased investments. \n \n48. \nThe  demand  of  the  subborrowers  will  determine  the  supports  that  the  Project  will \nprovide.  Short-  to  medium-term  credit  will  be  provided  through  qualified,  reputable  NGOs  to \nenable  the  project  target  groups  to  invest  in  agribusinesses.  In  addition,  assistance  will  be \nprovided to help ensure that proposals for credit are viable, properly presented, and ultimately \nprofitable.  The  Project,  a  pioneering  initiative  aimed  at  financing  rural  enterprises  through \nNGOs, fits with the corporate goals of the proven NGOs to scale up to efficient MFIs. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n49. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $60.0  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  service  charges  during  construction.  The \nestimated  foreign  exchange  cost  is  $6.9  million  equivalent,  or  about  11.5%  of  the  total  cost. \nLocal currency cost is estimated at $53.1 million equivalent, or about 88.5% of the total project \ncost.  The  local  currency  cost  will  include  an  estimated  $0.3  million  equivalent  for  taxes  and \nduties to be paid by the Government. Summary project cost estimates are in Table 1. A project \ncost summary by expenditure account is in Appendix 5. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n50. \nIn response to the Government\u2019s request, ADB decided to provide a loan of $42.5 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance 70.7% of the project cost. The ADB \nloan will fund the entire foreign exchange cost of $6.9 million, as well as $35.6 million equivalent \nof the local currency cost (67% of the total local currency cost). The Government is to provide \n$2.0  million  equivalent  in  the  form  of  incremental  staff  salary,  vehicle  rental,  overheads  and \noperational  cost,  and  taxes  and  duties.  Subborrowers  will  finance  $15.3  million  equivalent  (in \nthe form of asset contribution). Contracted service providers will finance $0.2 million equivalent \nof the project cost on agribusiness promotion activities.23 \n \n51. \nTable  2  summarizes  the  financing  plan.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Government  of \nBangladesh. The high level of local cost financing is justified given that the Project is poverty-\noriented  and  meets  the  financing  demand  for  small-scale  agribusiness  investment,  which  has \n                                                 \n23 Cofinancing, which is not envisioned now, might be mobilized from commercial sources in the future to complement \nADB financing  for the facility.  Such cofinancing could  benefit from ADB credit  enhancement, including  guarantee \ninstruments, and will be presented separately for consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors when it arises. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nlow foreign exchange inputs. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years.  The  loan  will  carry  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per year thereafter. The interest on the loan will be capitalized during the grace period. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nA.  Base Cost a \n\n1.  Credit for Small-Scale Agribusinesses \n\na.

The wholesale banks will lend to participating NGOs under onlending loan \nagreements upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The NGOs will provide these funds \nto  qualified  subborrowers  under  subloan  agreements  for  investments  within  the  scope  of  the \nProject.  Details  on  the  relending  and  onlending  terms  and  conditions  for  the  credit  line  are \ndiscussed in Appendix 7 (paras. 3\u20134). \n\n\fF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n53. \nThe  project  management  structure  is  in  Appendix  6.  MOA  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF) through its Finance Division will be the executing agencies. MOF will be responsible for \nmanaging and overseeing the flow of funds for the agribusiness credit line (component 1). It will \nbe  assisted  by  BASIC  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  and  participating  NGOs  whose  financial \nmanagement  was  found  to  be  satisfactory  for  project  implementation  and  whose  long-term \nfinancial outlook is considered sustainable. \n \n54.  MOA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  all  aspects  of  the  Project,  except  for \ncomponent  1.  The  agribusiness  cell  will  identify  and  correct  major  policy  constraints \n(components 4a). If necessary, a joint committee  will be set up to consider the recommended \namendments to the policy issues that are beyond MOA\u2019s mandate. DAM will be responsible for \nthe implementation of the rest of the Project, except for the provision of funds to NGOs. To help \nDAM  and  the  agribusiness  cell  fulfill  their  roles,  capacity  building  assistance  will  be  provided \nunder a grant-financed TA (paras. 67\u201368). \n \n55. \nPIU, headed by a project director satisfactory to ADB, will be set up to carry out project \nimplementation.  A  full-time  project  manager  will  assist  the  project  director  with  project \nmanagement  and  liaising  with  implementing  agencies  daily.  The  project  manager,  whose \nqualifications and experience will be satisfactory to ADB, will be hired on a commercial basis as \na  domestic  consultant.  Long-term  domestic  consultants,  backed  up  by  intermittent  inputs  from \ninternational consultants, will support PIU. In particular, an accounting specialist will be engaged \nto ensure the financial soundness of project management and the use of noncredit part of the \nproject funds. PIU will rent premises outside MOA and DAM. \n \nTo oversee and guide the Project and resolve policy issues, a project steering committee \n56. \n(PSC)  will  be  established24  and  will  meet  semiannually.  A  project  implementation  committee \n(PIC) will be established25 to provide a venue to coordinate project activities and discuss (and \nresolve) project implementation issues transparently. Detailed implementation arrangements for \nthe Project are in Appendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Implementation Period \n\nA  project  implementation  schedule  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  Project  will  be  implemented \n57. \nover 5 years starting in January 2006. Initially, the agribusiness cell and PIU will be set up and \nthe  required  staff  will  be  recruited.  This  period  will  be  followed  by  a  preparatory  phase,  which \nwill  entail  (i)  formulating  training  programs;  (ii)  assessing  the  range  of  agribusiness  services \navailable;  (iii)  assessing  the  needs  and  capacities  of  the  trade  and  industry  organizations,  as \nwell  as  financing  agencies;  and  (iv)  disseminating  information  about  the  Project.  Full \nimplementation will begin by the fourth quarter of the first year and continue until the last year of \nthe Project. \n\n                                                 \n24 The PSC, which will be chaired by the principal secretary of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, will consist of secretaries of \nEconomic  Relations  Division  and  the  Finance  Division  of  MOF,  Planning  Commission,  Agriculture,  Fisheries  and \nLivestock,  Commerce,  Industry,  and  the  representatives  of  Bangladesh  Bank,  BASIC  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  and \nparticipating NGOs. A secretariat for the PSC will be established in the agribusiness cell. An additional secretary of \nMOA, as the head of the agribusiness cell, will be the member secretary of the PSC. \n\n25 The PIC will consist of representatives of MOA, MOF, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, Planning \nCommission, DAM, BASIC Bank, Eastern Bank, participating NGOs, and agribusiness organizations. The PIC will \nbe chaired by the secretary of MOA, and the project director will be the member secretary of the PIC. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n58. \nThe indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. Goods and related services will \nbe procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (the Guidelines). The procurement of \nequipment and machinery by small-scale entrepreneurs will be in accordance with para. 3.08 of \nthe  Guidelines  (Purchase  of  Equipment  for  the  Use  of  Small  Private  Subborrowers).  A  few \nvehicles  and  a  small  amount  of  office  equipment  for  PIU  will  be  procured,  though  no  large \npurchases  are  required.  PIU  will  purchase  these  items  using  methods  specified  in  Public \nProcurement Regulation 200326 that are acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n59. \nThe Project will require 652 person-months of consulting services, including 93 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  559  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand other arrangements for recruitment of domestic consultants acceptable to ADB. Consultants \nwill be recruited as firms under three packages (Appendix 10) following quality and cost-based \nselection  procedures.  Appendix  10  outlines  the  estimated  consulting  service  schedule,  and \nSupplementary Appendix H gives the detailed terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n60. \nTo  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government \nwill  establish  two  project  imprest  accounts  in  the  name  of  the  Project  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness.  One  account  will  be  for  the  credit  line,  while  the  other  will  be  for  the  noncredit \ncomponents.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  held  in  Bangladesh  Bank  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment.  Each  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and other detailed arrangements agreed \nto by the Government and ADB. The initial deposit into each imprest account will not exceed the \nestimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 months for relevant components, or 10% of \nthe  relevant  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be \nused for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual \npayment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent. \n \n61. \nBASIC Bank and Eastern Bank each will establish and manage a revolving fund in their \nbanks  for  the  refinancing  of  participating  NGOs.  NGOs  will  repay  loan  principal  into  the \nrevolving  funds.  Revolving  loans  to  NGOs,  based  on  their  prior  repayments,  will  be  disbursed \nout  of  the  revolving  funds.  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  will  initiate  the  Government\u2019s \nrequests to ADB for replenishment of the imprest account. Further tranches of the credit line will \ntake into account the balance remaining in the revolving fund, and requests from NGOs for loan \nfinance  based  on  their  6-month  business  plans.  The  subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  the \nGovernment  and  wholesale  banks  will  establish  a  revolving  fund  mechanism,  acceptable  to \nADB.  Participating  NGOs  will  use  the  revolving  funds  exclusively  for  small-scale  agribusiness \nlending. The revolving funds will be maintained until ADB, in its discretion, requires the revolving \nfund to be dissolved. That decision will be made before project completion (para. 65). Balances \navailable in such revolving funds will be credited to appropriate entities that the Government, in \nconsultation with ADB, designates. \n \nEach participating NGO will establish project accounts for the credit line within 1 month \n62. \nof loan effectiveness. NGOs will request BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank for advance funding for \n\n                                                 \n26 Government of Bangladesh. 2003. Public Procurement Regulation. Dhaka. \n\n\ftheir  lending  programs  in  local  currency.  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  will  decide  on  the \namount of each loan to be sanctioned and disbursed, and then apply to the imprest account for \nthese  funds.  When  received,  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  will  disburse  funds  within  3 \nworking days to project accounts opened by each NGO in a reputable bank. The Government \nwill ensure that disbursements from the imprest account to BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank, and \nfrom  PIU  for  the  noncredit  activities,  will  be  made  within  5  working  days  of  receipt  of  the \ndisbursement applications. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n63.  MOA,  MOF,  BASIC  Bank,  Eastern  Bank,  and  the  participating  NGOs  will  maintain \nseparate  accounts  and financial statements  for  funds  provided  to  the  Project.  These  accounts \nand related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing \nstandards  consistently  applied  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  executing \nagencies and implementing agencies will furnish ADB with the audited accounts and statements \nnot later than 6 months after the end of the related fiscal year. PIU, through MOA, will submit to \nADB  diagnostic  semiannual  reports  detailing  project  progress  to  date,  problems  encountered, \nmeasures  taken  to  overcome  them,  and  expected  progress  over  the  next  6  months  period  as \nwell  as  any  major  or  serious  issues  which  need  to  be  expeditiously  addressed.  Six  months \nbefore the completion of the Project, PIU, through MOA, will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport,  detailing  the  utilization  of  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation  analysis,  and  the \nsocioeconomic impact of the Project on the intended participants and ultimate beneficiaries, with \nspecial attention to poverty reduction. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n64. \nPlanning  and  monitoring  of  project  progress  will  be  scheduled,  reviewed,  and  reported \nquarterly to ADB. A project performance management system (PPMS) will be established within \n6 months of project commencement. A monitoring team will be established within PIU, and each \nof  the  implementing  agencies,  to  ensure  the  operation  of  the  PPMS  throughout  the  Project. \nWithin  3  months  of  project  inception,  PIU  will  identify  baseline  indicators  in  discussions  with \nwholesale  banks  and  participating  NGOs.  The  main  focus  will  be  on  the  expansion  of \nagribusiness  investment,  employment,  and  sales  generated  by  the  Project.  In  terms  of  benefit \nmonitoring  for  component  1,  information  will  be  maintained  concerning  the  amounts  and \nnumbers of loans disbursed to, and repaid by, subborrowers. They will be categorized as input \nsuppliers,  primary  producers,  and  processors  and  marketing.  To  assess  incremental  benefits \nfrom the Project, basic household data for subborrowers will be kept concerning the number of \nfamily members, people employed, and estimated total revenues and net income. In addition to \ntheir  usual  financial  and  physical  reporting,  NGOs  will  classify  and  report  to  PIU,  through \nwholesale  banks,  on  their  agribusiness  loan  portfolio  each  3  months,  and  the  proportion  of \nagribusiness to total lending. Information will be maintained on the number of staff associated \nwith  agribusiness  lending,  as  well  as  the  number  of  staff  participating  in  agribusiness  courses \nand workshops. Information will be disaggregated by gender. Project lending and borrowing will \nbe  reviewed  against  total  lending  and  the  liability  structures  of  each  NGO,  and  against  the \noverall  financial  performance  of  each  NGO.  The  NGOs\u2019  performance  will  be  measured  by \nindicators such as (i) capital adequacy ratio, (ii) return on equity, (iii) average revenue on loans \noutstanding, (iv) administration expenses on lending, and (v) expenses to revenue ratio. During \npreparation of the project completion report, this data will be used to evaluate the impact of the \nProject  on  income  and  employment  generation,  and  on  improvements  in  the  quality  of  life, \nespecially  for  women  and  underprivileged  groups.  The  ability  of  NGOs  to  continue  to  serve \nsmall agribusinesses also will be evaluated. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n65.  MOA, MOF, and ADB will carry out a project review twice a year. A midterm review will \nbe  undertaken  not  later  than  2  years  and  6  months  after  project  commencement.  This  review \nwill include a comprehensive evaluation of the project implementation arrangements and project \nprogress,  as  well  as  consultations  with  the  stakeholders.  Recommendations  will  be  made  for \nadjustments,  as  appropriate,  to  the  project  scope,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation \narrangements,  including  the  feasibility  of  involving  additional  NGOs  under  the  credit  line \ncomponent.  Six  months  before  project  completion,  ADB  will  arrange,  in  consultation  with \nconcerned parties, for operating the revolving funds after project completion. \n \n\n9. \n\nMeasures to Enhance Governance and Prevent Corruption \n\nThe independent Anti-Corruption Commission, created with ADB support and constituted \n66. \non  21  November  2004,  will  investigate  all  cases  of  irregularities.  This  includes  financial \nirregularities,  as  well  as  corruption  of  government  officials  and  officers  and  employees  of \nautonomous  bodies.  The  project  design  incorporates  additional  project-specific  measures  to \nenhance  governance  and  prevent  corruption  during  implementation  (Appendix  11).  Good \ngovernance  measures,  designed  with \nthe \ndisbursement chain in mind, include (i) providing consultant support and an associated advisory \nTA for project management and implementation training to staff of PIU, particularly in consultant \nrecruitment and procurement; (ii) identifying beforehand the wholesale banks and participating \nNGOs;  (iii)  establishing  transparent  procedures  for  financial  transactions;  (iv)  requiring \nimplementing agencies to enter each amount  of disbursed funds into an accounting system; (v) \nmonitoring and reporting of NGO activities by PIU; (vi) appointing an NGO liaison officer within \nPIU to deal specifically with NGO concerns; and (vii) establishing the PIC. \n \n\nthe  stages  of  project \n\nimplementation  and \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR STRENGTHENING PROJECT MANAGEMENT \n\n67. \nThe  TA  is  to  assist  MOA  and  DAM  in  (i)  establishing  a  project  supervisory  and \nmonitoring  capacity  in  DAM,  and  (ii)  guiding  and  advising  the  personnel  of  DAM  and  PIU  in \nagribusiness promotion and project management during the first 4 years of the Project. The aim \nis  to  set  the  stage  for  an  expansion  of  agribusiness  by  establishing  a  focal  point  within  the \nGovernment  for  agribusiness  promotion.  Capacity  will  be  built  through  direct  experience  in \nadministering  and  implementing  the  Project,  guided  by  experienced  consultants.  As  a  result, \nDAM  can  develop  a  staff  force  familiar  with  (i)  implementing  aid  agency-financed  projects;  (ii) \ncharacteristics  of  agribusiness  promotion;  (iii)  NGOs  and  their  programs;  and  (iv)  other \ninstitutions contributing to agribusiness, such as agribusiness associations and enterprises. \n \n68. \nAppendix 12 discusses terms of reference, cost estimates, and financing plan for the TA. \nThe  estimated  TA  cost  is  $800,000  equivalent,  with  an  ADB  grant  from  the  TA  Special  Fund \ncovering  $600,000  equivalent.  The  Government  will  finance  $200,000  equivalent  to  cover \nworkshops  and  training,  office  accommodation,  additional  vehicle  rental  and  transport,  and \nremuneration  of  counterpart  staff.  The  TA  will  need  an  international  project  management \ntraining advisor with experience in project management and agribusiness promotion (12 person-\nmonths)  on  an  intermittent  basis.  It  also  will  need  a  full-time  senior  domestic  project \nmanagement  training  specialist  (48  person-months).  They  will  be  recruited  individually  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for \nrecruitment of domestic consultants acceptable to ADB. A vehicle and a set of office equipment \nwill be procured using direct purchase following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n\n\fV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\n69. \nDetails of the Project Justification and Financial Analysis are in Appendix 13. The Project \nwill stimulate commercial activities in the agriculture sector ranging from preproduction support \nthrough commercial production to postproduction handling, processing, transport, storage, and \nmarketing.  An  expansion  of  these  activities,  and  increases  in  the  value  added  to  agricultural \nproduce,  will  generate  economic  growth  and  employment,  primarily  in  the  rural  areas,  though \nalso in urban centers to some extent. Direct project beneficiaries will comprise the owners and \nemployees of about 28,000 small agribusinesses. Each venture will employ 1\u201310 persons, more \nthan  half  of  which  will  be  poor.  Additional  indirect  benefits  will  come  from  (i)  increased \nproduction,  resulting  from  the  availability  of  better  support  services;  (ii)  greater  demand  for \nagricultural  produce  for  processing  and  urban  sales,  raising  prices  and  augmenting  the \nquantities of produce marketed; and (iii) a multiplier effect generated through greater demands \nfor labor, transport, storage, and handling. Disadvantaged groups will benefit from higher labor \ndemand,  and  through  the  promotion  of  intensive  agribusiness  activities  (such  as  dairy,  poultry \nraising, and fish farming) that do not require significant land. \n \nAn assessment of market demand indicates that sufficient bankable subprojects exist to \n70. \njustify  the  size  of  the  agribusiness  credit  line.  A  review  of  sample  enterprises  shows  that \nagribusiness investment is profitable, and generates substantial and permanent employment for \nthe  rural  poor.  Financial  projections  (Appendix  13  and  Supplementary  Appendixes  C\u2013G), \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment  Projects,  indicate  that  the  NGOs  will  be  in  compliance  with  prudential  financial \nindicators throughout the Project. The projected financial statements, together with the financial \nmanagement  assessments,  suggest  that  NGOs  and  wholesale  banks  have  sufficient  financial \nand managerial capacity. The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Impacts \n\n71. \nAppendix 14 presents the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy. The Project \nwill  have  significant  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Direct  impacts  will  come \nfrom  employment  created  by  new  or  expanded  enterprises.  Indirect  impacts  will  come  from \nemployment  and  higher  incomes  generated  by  increased  demand  for  produce  and  services, \nsuch as transport, handling, and storage needed for the operation of the new enterprises. Each \nsmall enterprise assisted by the agribusiness credit is to generate on average 2.5 new jobs. The \naverage wage paid to staff is Tk115\u2013130 per working day, well above the average of Tk65 for \nrural workers. The poverty ratio in rural areas, where most of these enterprises will be located, \nis  53%,  and  the  demand  will  be  for  mostly  semiskilled  and  unskilled  labor.  Thus,  a  high \nproportion of those employed will be poor. In addition, some indirect impacts will be generated \nthrough the expanded demand for raw materials. This will stimulate production, creating further \nemployment  and  income-earning  opportunities.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  Project \ngoes  beyond  the  simple  provision  of  a  daily  wage,  however.  Full-time  employment  also  can \nprovide  sustained  economic  and  social  betterment.  Previously  unskilled  laborers  will  have  the \nopportunity to learn skills and develop a craft, and semiskilled workers will have the opportunity \nto perfect their skills. \n \n72. \nAs shown in Appendix 15, the Gender Action Plan (GAP) discussed specific actions to \nensure that women receive as many of the project benefits as possible. Women\u2019s entrepreneur \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nassociations  will  be  provided  with  strengthening  assistance  under  component  2,  and  their \nmembers will be encouraged to use the services provided under the same component. Some of \nthe  NGOs  providing  credit  are  focusing  their  efforts  to  a  large  extent  on  women  borrowers, \nwhich  will  continue  under  the  Project.  A  significant  number  of  borrowers  will  be  women,  as \ndemonstrated by the existing borrowers from NGOs such as TMSS, especially for dairy, poultry, \nfish-culture, fruit, vegetable, and flower cultivation, as well as small-scale processing. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental and Resettlement Aspects \n\nRisks \n\nThe Project will involve many small-scale investments ($500\u2013$5,000 equivalent) around \n73. \nthe country. As such, any single activity under the Project is unlikely to have anything other than \na  minor  localized  environmental  impact,  or  require  any  involuntary  displacement  of  local \npopulations.  Public  sector  entities  will  not  expropriate  or  acquire  any  land  under  the  Project. \nNevertheless,  the  project  design  has  incorporated  safeguards  to  minimize  potential  negative \neffects.  Environmental  and  social  impact  specialists  will  be  engaged  to  ensure  that  the \nenvironmental  and  social  concerns  of  ADB  and  the  Government  are  incorporated  into  work \nplanning  and  monitoring  of  the  Project.  Through  training,  NGO  staff  will  learn  about  potential \nnegative impacts that might result from the economic activities they will be promoting, as well as \nthe means to avoid or mitigate such impacts. \n \nB. \n \n74. \nThe majority of the investment under the Project will be for component 1. Risks include \n(i) increased financial risks to NGOs due to the larger subloans to be provided to each borrower, \n(ii) increased credit risk to BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank in making larger-than-normal loans to \nNGOs, and (iii) the possibility that NGOs will not follow sound procedures in providing subloans. \nThe increased financial risk to NGOs will be addressed in three ways: (i) only NGOs with sound \ntrack  records  and  a  substantial  financial  base  will  be  chosen;  (ii)  the  Project  will  provide \nsignificant  technical  training  and  support  to  NGOs  and  the  borrowers;  (iii)  by  focusing  on \nborrowers  who  have  experience  and  some  success  with  previous  microcredit  borrowing  or \nmicroenterprise experience, the Project will select low-risk, experienced clients. The increased \ncredit  risk  to  wholesale  banks  will  be  handled  by  following  prudent  practices,  including  (i) \nincreasing  loan  size  to  NGOs  deliberately  and  steadily  based  on  repayment  performance  of \nprior tranches, coupled with initial short-term lending followed by longer terms based on proven \nperformance;  (ii) limiting  the  lending  to  any  single  NGO  in  a  year  to  less  than  15%  of  the \nwholesale  bank\u2019s  net  worth  by  engaging  two  wholesale  banks;  (iii)  viewing  all  assets  and \nliabilities of each NGO borrower and expected operating surpluses, rather than considering only \nproject-related  activities.  This  latter  practice  will  be  linked  to  a  set  of  indicators  (and  action \ntriggers) to keep the mix of assets and liabilities balanced.27 To address the risk of NGOs not \nfollowing  sound  procedures,  PIU  will  undertake  a  strong  PPMS,  complemented  by  the \nwholesale banks\u2019 rigorous review of loan applications from NGOs and the performance of their \nloan portfolios. \n \n75. \nAnother risk is that vested interests in the Government might delay, or refuse to make, \nrecommended  and  needed  changes  to  legislation  or  regulations  governing  the  sector.  The \nproject  design  has  provided  for  this  eventuality  by  allowing  for  an  extensive  series  of  public \nconsultations,  seminars,  and  workshops  after  the  initial  studies.  Through  these  measures,  the \ntransparency of the consultation and reform process will make it difficult for parties with special \ninterests to affect the outcome of regulatory reform. \n\n                                                 \n27  The set of triggers could be that the capital adequacy ratio is always greater than 20%, return on equity more than \n\n12%, total borrowings less than 50% of loans outstanding, and expenses to revenues less than 90%. \n\n\fVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n19 \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n76. \nBank have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthat, \n\nThe  Government  will  establish  within  DAM  the  PIU,  which  will  be  headed  by  a \nproject  director.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthroughout  project \nimplementation, the PIU is staffed adequately with competent full-time personnel, \naccording to the staffing schedule agreed with ADB. A full-time project manager \nwill assist the project director in managing PIU on a day-to-day basis. The project \nmanager, with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB, will be hired on \na contract basis from the open market as a domestic consultant. \nThe Government will set up within MOA the agribusiness cell. Qualified staff from \nwithin  MOA  will  be  assigned  to  the  cell.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nagribusiness cell, which will be headed by an additional secretary of MOA, will be \nadequately staffed throughout project implementation. \nThe  Government  will  establish  the  PIC  to  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  MOA. \nThe PIC will consist of representatives of MOA, MOF, Implementation Monitoring \nand  Evaluation  Division,  Planning  Commission,  DAM,  BASIC  Bank,  Eastern \nBank, participating NGOs, agribusiness organizations, and the project director. \nThe Government will establish the PSC to be chaired by the principal secretary of \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The PSC will consist of secretaries of the Economic \nRelations  Division  and  the  Finance  Division  of  MOF,  Planning  Commission, \nAgriculture, Fisheries and Livestock, Commerce, and Industry, representatives of \nBangladesh Bank, BASIC Bank, Eastern Bank, and participating NGOs. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  adequate  financing  is  made  available  in  DAM\u2019s \nannual budget for the operation of PIU throughout project implementation. \nThe  Government  will  not  plan  or  grant  any  debt  amnesty,  or  forgive  loan \nrepayment obligations of subborrowers under the Project\u2019s credit line. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the  project  implementation  and \noperation of the revolving fund BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank will be required to \ncomply  with  prudential  financial  indicators  set  by  Bangladesh  Bank,  including, \namong others, (a) classified loans less than 10% of total loans outstanding, (b) a \ncapital adequacy ratio of at least 9%, (c) a loan deposit ration of not more than \n1.0.  In  addition,  the  participating  NGOs  will  have  to  satisfy  the  agreed  eligibility \ncriteria. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern  Bank  will  ensure  that  no  material \norganizational  changes  (financial,  operational,  or  structural),  or  any  changes  in \nownership of the project facilities, will be approved or implemented without prior \napproval  of  ADB,  if  such  changes  would  affect  their  ability  to  perform  their \nrespective obligations under the Project. \nThe  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern  Bank  will  establish  and  maintain \nseparate accounts under the Project, and will cause the participating NGOs to do \nthe same. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB will audit such accounts and \nrelated financial statements. The auditors\u2019 reports, with the audited accounts and \nfinancial statements, will be submitted annually to ADB through PIU. \nThe  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern  Bank  will  ensure  that  satisfactory \nprocedures and operational policies for supervision and monitoring subloans will \nbe  established  and  maintained  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  project \nobjectives, and will cause the participating NGOs to do the same. \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nThe Government, BASIC Bank, and Eastern Bank will ensure compliance with all \napplicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Bangladesh  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  2002  and  the  established  environmental  assessment  and \nreview procedures, and will cause each participating NGO to do the same. Any \nproject activities that harm the environment will not be utilized for financing. \nThe  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern  Bank  will  ensure  that  no  project \nactivity will entail land acquisition or any involuntary resettlement impact including \nrelocation, and will cause each participating NGO to do the same. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government,  BASIC  Bank,  and  Eastern  Bank  will  adopt  and  fully  carry  out \nthe  GAP,  and  will  cause  each  participating  NGO  to  do  the  same.  The  GAP \nimplementation will be documented in the PPMS and reported to ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  have  countersigned  and  delivered  to  ADB  a  TA  letter  for  the \n\n \nCondition for Loan Signing \n\nB. \n \n77. \nassociated advisory TA for strengthening project management. \n \nC. \n \n78. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nBefore loan effectiveness, three conditions must be met: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will have approved the Project\u2019s development project proposal. \nPIU,  the  agribusiness  cell,  PIC,  and  PSC  will  have  been  set  up  and  made \noperational in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  MOF  and  BASIC  Bank,  and  between \nMOF  and  Eastern  Bank,  will  have  been  signed  and  delivered  to  ADB  in  a  form \nand  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB.  These  agreements  will  have  become \neffective  and  binding  upon  the  parties,  in  accordance  with  their  terms,  subject \nonly to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. \n\n \nCondition for Disbursement \n\nD. \n \n79.  Withdrawals will not be made from the loan account for the credit line component of the \nProject  until  ADB  has  received  at  least  two  executed  onlending  agreements,  in  a  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB:  one  between  BASIC  Bank  and  one  of  the  ADB  recommended \nparticipating NGOs (BRAC, ASA, and TMSS),  and one between Eastern Bank and one of the \nsame participating NGOs. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n80. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 28,910,000 to Bangladesh for the Agribusiness \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n4 October 2005 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment policies and \nactions support leading \nroles of NGOs and \nprivate sector in \nagribusiness. \n \nGDP annual real growth \nof 5%, agribusiness \nannual growth rate of \n7%. \n \nRural infrastructure \ndeveloped and/or \nimproved and sustained. \n \nGovernment develops \nand monitors proper \nstatistical framework for \nagribusiness. \nAssumption \nNo serious \nmacroeconomic and/or \nbanking crises. \n \nRisks \nMarket fluctuations. \n \nNatural disasters such \nas flooding. \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nReduced poverty in \nBangladesh through \nagribusiness growth \nthat generates income \nand employment in \nrural areas. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \nAgribusiness grows at an \nannual rate of 2 percentage \npoints above the annual \ngrowth rate of GDP by 2010. \n \nAgribusiness contribution to \nGDP increased from the 10% \nto 15% by 2020. \n \nAt least 40,000 small-scale \nagribusinesses start up or \nexpand, and generate at least \n100,000 jobs by 2020. \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting Mechanisms  \n \nGovernment statistics on \nemployment, agriculture \nproduction and \nproductivity, trade, import \nand export, household \nincome, and expenditure \nsurveys \n \nBangladesh Bank \nbanking statistics \n\nOutcome \nExpanded activities of \nrural enterprises \nengaged in \ncommercial agriculture \nproduction, input \nsupply, marketing, \nprocessing, and \ntransportation. \n\n \nNGO records \n \nInvestment, purchasing, \nand production figures of \ndownstream agro-\nindustries \n \nProject benefit monitoring \nsurveys \n \nProject progress reports \n \nProject completion report \n\n \nInvestment in agribusiness \nactivities by participating \nentrepreneurs more than \ndoubles by project completion \nreview. \n \nSales of agribusinesses \nincrease by 30% by project \ncompletion review. \n \nNumber of women \nagribusiness entrepreneurs \nincreases by 50% by project \ncompletion review. \n \nNumber of employees in \nagribusinesses increases by \nabout 30% by project \ncompletion review. \n \nThe value added per unit of \ncommodities increases by \nabout 20\u201330% by project \ncompletion review. \n \nPost-harvest losses drop by \n20\u201330% of value of product \nproduction by project \ncompletion review. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nOutputs \n1.

Per  capita  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) is $361, and poverty incidence based on calorie intake is 50%.1 While \nthe incidence of poverty nationwide is high, rural poverty is even higher at 53%. Moreover, while \nurban  poverty  declined  throughout  the  1990s  at  a  reasonable  rate  of  2.2%  per  year,  rural \npoverty  has  been  much  more  intractable,  declining  at  the  significantly  slower  annual  rate  of \n1.6%.2  The  major  economic  activity  in  rural  areas  is  agriculture  production  and  agriculture-\nrelated activities. The agriculture sector accounts for about 60% of employment nationwide and \nabout 90% in rural areas. \n \n2. \nPoverty in Bangladesh remains largely rural: 80% of the population and 85% of the poor \nlive  in  the  countryside. The  source of  rural  poverty  can  be readily  identified.  Due  to  extremely \nhigh  population  density,  most  of  the  rural  residents  eke  out  a  living  from  limited  land  and \nagriculture  resources.  Some  6  million  households  (or  33%  of  the  population)  have  no  farm \nholdings  at  all,  effectively  meaning  they  are  landless.  Another  3.4  million  households  (19%  of \nthe population) have only marginal holdings of 0.02 hectare to 0.20 hectare. Thus, most people \nin Bangladesh do not have the land to earn enough income or grow enough food to be anything \nbut  poor.  On  the  other  hand,  few  other  significant  sources  of  income  are  available  other  than \nagriculture  production.  The  country  has  few  mineral  resources,  almost  no  forest  resources, \nlimited  power  generation  capacity,  and  severe  infrastructure  and  location  limitations  on  rapid \nindustrialization.  As  such,  agriculture  still  represents  the  major  source  of  raw  materials  in  the \ncountry. Productive agricultural land, along with the manpower to cultivate it, is still the country\u2019s \nmain  resources  and  assets.  Thus,  any  reduction  in  poverty  will  have  to  come  from  an \nintensification and diversification of the agriculture sector, as well as an increase in value added \nfrom the sector.  \n \n3. \nEven so, with the majority of the population owning so little land, most households never \nwill break out of poverty through traditional crop production on their own land. Instead, they will \nhave to earn their living from (i) producing higher value commodities, such as high-value crops \nor  livestock  and  fisheries  products;  (ii)  increased  employment  on  larger  farms;  or  (iii)  through \nemployment  in  agro-based  enterprises  of  one  type  or  another.  Thus,  the  reduction  of  rural \npoverty  depends  on  a  commercialization  of  the  agriculture  sector  to  generate  a  range  of \nincome-earning  opportunities  in  (i)  diversified  and  intensified  production,  (ii)  input  supply,  (iii) \nprovision  of  services,  (iv)  processing,  (v)  packaging,  (vi)  transport,  and  (vii)  downstream \nmarketing  to  urban  centers  or  abroad.  In  other  words,  the  reduction  of  rural  poverty  in \nBangladesh  will  depend  on  the  expansion  of  commercial  activities  in  the  agriculture  sector\u2014\nagribusiness.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Osmani, S.

Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nB. \n\nCharacteristics of Agriculture and Agribusiness in Bangladesh \n\n1. \n\nOverall Importance \n\n \nAgriculture  remains  a  fundamental  sector  of  the  economy,  accounting  for  22%  of  the \n4. \nGDP in 2002 (down from about 30% at the end of the 1980s) and absorbing more than 60% of \nthe  workforce.  When  forward  and  backward  links  are  taken  into  account,  the  agriculture  and \nagribusiness contribution to GDP is estimated at about 35% (as opposed to about 38% in 1990), \nwhile  the  contribution  to  employment  exceeds  75%.3  Agribusinesses  comprise  about  3  million \nenterprises,  of  which  90%  have  less  than  10  workers  or  employees  and  36%  have  only  one \nworker. Nonetheless, they are estimated to account for half of household income for about 15 \nmillion people.4 \n \n\n2. \n\nCrop Production and Diversification \n\n \n5. \nCrop  production  in  Bangladesh  is  being  transformed  from  subsistence  farming  to \ncommercial  farming.  Most  agricultural  production  still  is  concentrated  on  a  limited  number  of \ncrops,  with  rice  accounting  for  about  79%  of  total  cultivated  area.  Other  major  crops  include \nwheat  (5.0%),  jute  (3.2%),  pulses  (3.4%),  sugarcane  (1.2%),  and  oilseeds  (3.0%).  With  the \nexception  of  wheat,  most  of  these  are  traditional  crops  with  only  a  limited  scope  for  major \nmarket  expansion  or  value  added  during  processing.  Crops  with  a  high  potential  for  cash \nincome generation and value added through further processing, urban market sales, or export \ninclude spices, fresh vegetables, fruits, and potatoes. Though such crops account for only about \n5% of the total cropped area,5 the scope to expand production of these crops is considerable as \ndemand  and  markets  for  the  produce  are  developed.  Bangladesh  has  begun  to  enter  the \nEuropean  market  with  exports  of  vegetables  and  other  high-value  crops.  The  demand \nencourages private sector investment in high-value crop production, seed production (especially \nhybrid seeds), chemical and blended fertilizers, agroprocessing enterprises, etc.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLivestock \n\n \n6. \nLivestock  production  accounts  for  about  3%  of  GDP  and  10%  of  agricultural  GDP. \nLivestock production is an important component of the household income of poorer households, \nand  employs  about  20%  of  the  rural  labor  force.  Livestock  production  also  has  important \nbackward links through the requirement for feed and (in the case of poultry) chicks, as well as \nforward links through processing.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFisheries \n\n \n7. \nFisheries are another important component of the sector. While Bangladesh\u2019s access to \nmarine fish resources is limited, its inland fisheries resources are among the richest in the world. \nFisheries provides livelihood to more than 1 million full-time and 10 million part-time fisher folks, \nand fish make up 80% of the animal protein intake of the population. Fisheries account for about \n6% of the country\u2019s GDP and 72% of agriculture exports. Most of these exports consist of frozen \nshrimp,  which  generate  foreign  exchange  earnings  of  $270  million  annually  and  constitute  the \n\n                                                 \n3  Agrico  Limited.  2004.

Rising incomes in rural and urban areas in Bangladesh \nhave  spurred  demand  for  noncereal  crops,  livestock,  fishery,  and  processed  food  products,  a \ntrend that will continue to increase. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Income Elasticity for Major Product Groups \n\n \n\n \n\nFood \n\nCereals Noncereal \n\nFruits \n\nFish \n\nLivestock  Services \n\nCrops \n0.72 \n0.55 \n\nRural \nUrban \n\nIncome \nElasticity \nSource: Hossain, M. 2003.

Private sector involvement in agribusiness was \nrelatively modest and limited to subsectors such as tea, rice and wheat milling, and marketing of \nagricultural  products.  In  the  1990s,  private  agribusinesses,  as  well  as  trade  and  industry \nassociations, began to grow. This accelerated in the second part of the decade, and continued \nin  the  early  part  of  the  2000s.  Most  growth  took  place  in  subsectors  such  as  poultry,  shrimp, \npotato and cold storage, fruit processing, and supermarket chains. \n \nFour  interrelated  factors  were  responsible  for  the  emergence  of  private  agribusiness \n10. \nduring  the  1990s.  First,  market  reforms  initiated  during  the  1980s  and  continued  in  the  1990s \nprovided  a  policy  framework  for  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  several  activities \npreviously  controlled  by  the  public  sector,  such  as  the  distribution  of  agricultural  inputs  and \nagricultural  exports.  Second,  sustained  growth  of  the  economy  has  increased  purchasing \npower, particularly in urban areas, with the consequent increase in demand for nonstaple foods \nand  more  processed  items.  Rice  self-sufficiency  achieved  during  this  period  increased  food \nsecurity  and  expanded  opportunities  for  agricultural  and  nonfarm  diversification.  Third, \ninfrastructure  developments  (the  most  notable  example  being  the  Jamuna  bridge)  improved \nopportunities for enterprise development. Improvements in road and telephone (e.g., the mobile \nrevolution  and  internet)  communication,  electrification,  and  energy  infrastructure  (e.g.,  gas \npipelines),  while  far  from  being  adequate,  have  stimulated  greater  trade  volumes  and \ninvestment  outside  the  two  major  urban  centers  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong.  Fourth,  some \nprojects have facilitated the emergence of new agribusiness ventures and strengthened existing \nones.  The  most  important  example  of  these  projects  was  the  Agro-based  Technology \nDevelopment  Project  I,  which  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  funded \nduring 1996\u20132001. \n \n\n7. \n\nDistribution of Agribusinesses in Bangladesh \n\n \n11. \nBangladesh  has  many  household  level,  cottage  or  micro-industries  concerned  with \nprocessing agricultural and related raw materials, including nonfood items, involving jute, cotton, \nbamboo,  or  timber.  Nonfarm  households  (i.e.,  the  landless)  mange  about  half  of  these,  while \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nmostly  small  farmers  (owning  less  than  1.0  hectare)  manage  the  rest.  These  activities  can  be \nvery important to the livelihood of the poorer segments of rural communities, which are unable \nto  survive  on  crop  production  alone.  Often,  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  microfinance \nfunds  them.  Investments  in  this  category  are  typically  below  $1,000  per  household.  These \nenterprises usually serve a localized market around the village or subdistrict headquarters. \n \n12. \nThe  next  layer  of  agribusiness  is  made  up  of  rural-based  enterprises.  Bangladesh  has \nabout 3 million such enterprises, which make up the bulk of the country\u2019s agribusinesses. These \ntypically  include  small  poultry,  dairy,  and  fisheries  enterprises,  as  well  as  rural  produce  and \ninput  traders  and  transporters.  This  segment  of  rural  business  is  fairly  dynamic  and  market-\ndriven. Investments are $1,000\u2013$10,000 per enterprise.  \n \n13.  Medium-sized,  generally  urban-based,  agroprocessing  enterprises  constitute  another \nlayer.  These  include  commercial  juice,  jelly,  jam,  pickles,  and  snack  food  preparation;  potato \ncold  stores;  fish  freezing  plants;  and  farmers'  service  cooperatives.  Most  of  them  have \ninvestments  well  below  $100,000.  At  the  upper  level  of  the  agroprocessing  sector  are  large \nhigh-technology,  capital-intensive  enterprises,  such  as  integrated  shrimp  processors,  which \nhave been  operating in Bangladesh for some time and producing for export  markets. Many of \nthese  have  investments  exceeding  $100,000.  However,  overcapacity  has  affected  the  shrimp \nindustry  due  to  disease  problems  in  shrimp  ponds,  as  well  as  difficulties  with  meeting  the \nhygienic standards of the European Union. Exporters are resolving some of these problems by \nadhering to strict hygiene standards. A few large, urban-based processors also are engaged in \nthe juice, poultry, and dairy industries that serve the national market.  \n \nThese different strata of agribusiness tend to serve different markets. Table A2.2 shows \n14. \nan  analysis  of  cottage,  small,  medium,  and  large  enterprises  in  the  country,  the  majority  of \nwhich are agriculture-based. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Relationship Between Size of Company and Target Market \n\nScale \n(Capital Investment) \n\nLocal Village \nMarket \n\nNearest \nTown \n\nNational \nMarket \n\nRegional \nExports \n\nEU and US \nMarkets \n\nCottage (less than $1,000) \n\nSmall ($1,000\u2013$10,000) \n\nMedium ($10,000\u2013$100,000) \n\nLarge (more than $100,000) \n\nHigh \n\nLow \n\nLow \n\nLow \n\nLow \n\nHigh \n\nModerate \n\nModerate \n\n \n\nLow \n\nHigh \n\nHigh \n\n \n\n \n\nLow \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nModerate \n\nLow \n\nEU = European Union, US = United States. \nSource:  Montgomery,  R.

The sector also started modest diversification into value-added \nproducts,  such  as  fruits,  vegetables,  poultry,  dairy,  and  fish.  This  improvement  was  achieved \ndespite a large population (close to 140 million) and high population density, scarce cultivable \nland  (an  average  of  0.6  hectare  per  household),  and  regular  occurrence  of  natural  calamities. \nNonetheless,  the  overall  annual  growth  rate  of  agricultural  GDP  during  the  1990s  averaged \nabout  2.4%,  versus  overall  GDP  growth  of  5%.  Over  the  past  4  years,  general  agricultural \ngrowth has improved, reaching an annual average growth rate of 3.7%. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n16.  While  Bangladesh  has  the  potential  to  intensify  and  diversify  production  further,  and \ndevelop  backward  and  forward  links  (through  processing,  packaging,  storage,  and  export \nindustries), little progress has been made. Most processing is small in scale and aimed at local \nmarkets.  The  poultry,  dairy,  and  shrimp  subsectors  appear  to  be  exhibiting  the  most  rapid \ngrowth. In terms of post-harvest handling, packaging, storage and transport, the country is also \nseriously  underdeveloped.  For  the  local  markets,  virtually  no  packaging  is  used.  Perishable \nfruits and vegetables are handled and transported in bulk or semi-bulk baskets, trucks, or boats \nwithout any protection or packaging. Motorized transport is available everywhere in Bangladesh. \nHowever, moving commodities from farm to consumer can take up to 10 days due to the many \nmarket intermediaries, and the need to pack and repack at every stage of the marketing chain. \nWarehouse  and  cold  storage  facilities  for  agricultural  commodities  are  lacking.  Except  for \npotatoes,  virtually  no  cold  storage  facilities  are  available  for  vegetables.  Therefore,  much \nremains to be done to realize the potential for the generation of additional employment through \nhigher value agriculture and agribusiness, and to reduce poverty significantly.  \n \nC. \n\nConstraints \n\n17. \nA  plethora  of  constraints  impede  the  development  of  commercially  based  agriculture \nproduction,  processing,  and  marketing  in  Bangladesh.  Many  are  associated  with  the  severely \nlimited infrastructure, such as (i) poor road, rail, and water transport connections; (ii) inadequate \nand poorly maintained markets; (iii) lack of electricity connections (most rural households do not \nhave  electricity  connections  and  the  power  supply  is  unpredictable);  (iv)  poor  port  and  airport \nfacilities, limiting access to export markets; and (v) general lack of storage facilities. \n \n18. \nThe  regulatory  environment  in  the  country  also  constrains  commercial  activities  in,  or \nrelated  to,  the  agriculture  sector.  Produce  markets  are  poorly  run  and  maintained.  Nationally \nenforced  quality  and  health  standards  for  agricultural  produce  are  missing.  In  addition,  the \ngeneral  public  and  potential  private  sector  investors,  as  well  as  the  staffs  of  public  sector  line \nagencies,  financing  agencies,  and  development  institutions,  generally  do  not  understand  the \npotential  for  agribusiness  development.  Knowledge  of  potential  markets  for  different  types  of \nagriculture  products  also  is  lacking.  Moreover,  potential  investors  are  deficient  in  technical \nknow-how. \n \n19. \nHowever,  the  most  serious  constraint  is  the  inability  of  potential  investors  to  mobilize \nfinance  for  agribusiness  ventures.  The  two  sources  of  formal  credit  available  in  rural \nBangladesh  are  commercial  banks  and  NGOs.  Few  rural  enterprises  borrow  from  commercial \nbanks.  Banks  are  not  interested  in  the  small  loans  that  many  agro-based  enterprises  require, \nand potential small-scale investors usually lack the collateral required by commercial banks to \nsecure  a  loan.  The  National  Private  Sector  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Bangladesh  (footnote  4) \nindicated that less than 15% of enterprises had received formal credit from commercial banks. \nBorrowing from NGOs also was limited. The survey found that 17% of enterprises had received \ncredit  from  NGOs,  although  finance  was  identified  as  the  most  important  start-up  problem \nenterprises had faced. NGO lending for agribusiness has not been extensive. Except for a few \nof the more experienced NGOs, which are pioneering lending to enterprises, most traditionally \nhave focused on poverty-targeted microfinance. \n \nD. \n\nImplications for Project Design \n\n20. \nGiven the many landless and marginal farmers, increases in the production of traditional \nstaple  crops  alone  will  not  be  sufficient  to  reduce  rural  poverty  in  Bangladesh.  Nonetheless, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\neconomic growth and poverty reduction still will depend on increases in agriculture production \nand  value  added  to  that  production.  No  other  comparable  resource  base  is  available.  This \ngrowth, however, will have to be based on employment generated and value added by switching \nto  higher  value  commodities,  and  developing  economic  activities  based  on  commercially \noriented  upstream  and  downstream  links  within  the  sector.  The  potential  for  growth  in  these \ntypes of activities is limited by the narrow range of commodities produced in the country. Still, \nthe scope is large enough to generate considerable growth and employment through upstream \ninput  and  service  industries,  as  well  as  downstream  handling,  storage,  and  processing \nindustries. Given  the  difficulties  of accessing  international  markets  on  a  large  scale,  these  will \nbe focused primarily on local and national markets. \n \n21. \nSome  constraints  continue  to  prevent  the  rapid  commercialization  of  the  agriculture \nsector  and  agribusiness  development.  As  many  of  these  constraints  are  infrastructure-based, \nthey  will  not  be  resolved  until  the  country  has better  roads,  rail links, water  transport  facilities, \nand  international  connections,  as  well  as  a  more  extensive  and  dependable  electricity  supply. \nMany  constraints,  however,  can  be  tackled  now.  These  include  constraints  imposed  by  (i)  the \nregulatory  environment;  (ii)  a  lack  of  knowledge  of  investment  potentials  and  the  technologies \ninvolved in improved handling, storage, and processing; and (iii) lack of access to finance. The \nProject has been designed to begin addressing these latter constraints. The aim is to promote \nrealistic  agribusiness  development  within  the  medium  term,  while  awaiting  the  longer-term \ninfrastructure  improvements  (i.e.,  more  and  better  roads,  more  dependable  electricity  supply, \nand  better  and  more  efficient  port  facilities).  The  longer-term  improvements  will  be  needed  to \nstimulate growth in the sector and the development of export markets.  \n \nNGOs are the primary strategic points of entry to address the constraints to the sector. \n22. \nUnder  the  Project,  NGOs  will  provide  agribusinesses  with  the  finance  they  need  to  grow  and \nexpand.  Several  reputable  NGOs  now  target  enterprises  with  loans  of  up  to  $5,000,  whereas \nearlier  lending  seldom  exceeded  $500  per  subloan.  However,  they  are  having  increasing \ndifficulty  mobilizing  the  finance  they  require  for  these  programs.  For  BRAC  alone,  the  funding \nrequirement in 2005 exceeds $100 million\u2014and 20% growth in lending is projected each year. \nAgribusiness in Bangladesh comprises numerous small borrowers spread throughout the rural \nareas, which has limited the ability of NGOs to provide sound financial services with training and \nsupport. As such, an efficient means of supporting agribusiness in Bangladesh is to support the \nNGOs\u2019 new strategic thrust into the sector.  \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nProject Title \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise \nSector Development Program \n\nNorthwest Crop Diversification \nProject \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE WITH RELEVANCE TO AGRIBUSINESS \n\nDuration \n\n2005\u20132008 \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\nFinance Division of \nMinistry of Finance, \nBangladesh Bank \n\nDonors \n\nADB \n\nFunding \n\n$50.0 million \n\n2001\u20132008 \n\nDAE, Bangladesh Bank \n\nADB \n\n$46.3 million \n\nRural Livelihood Project \n\n1999\u20132006 \n\nADB \n\n$42.6 million \n\nSecond Participatory Livestock \nDevelopment Project \n\n2004\u20132010 \n\nADB, Danida \n\n$20.5 million \n\nParticipatory Livestock \nDevelopment Project \n\n1997\u20132003 \n\nDepartment of Livestock \nServices \n\nADB, Danida \n\n$30.0 million \n\nBangladesh Rural \nDevelopment Board \n\nPKSF, Department of \nLivestock Services \n\nRural Infrastructure Improvement \nProject \n\n2003\u20132008 \n\nLGED \n\n1998\u20132005 \n\nLGED \n\nThird Rural Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project \n\nFarm to Market Enterprise \nDevelopment Project \n\nAgriculture Sector Programme \nSupport \n\n1998\u20132002 \n\nDAE \n\nCIDA \n\n$14.0 million \n\n2000\u20132011 \n\nMOA, MOFL \n\nDanida \n\n$60.0 million \n\nADB, GTZ, \nKfW \n\nADB, IFAD, \nSIDA, JBIC \n\n$76.9 million \n\n$139.6 million \n\nAgricultural Market Information \nImprovement Project \n\n2002\u20132003 \n\nDepartment of Agricultural \nMarketing \n\nIntegrated Horticulture and \nNutrition Development Project  \n\nBusiness Development Service \nProgram \n\n2000\u20132005 \n\nDAE \n\nBangladesh Seed Development \nProgram \n\n1997\u20132004 \n\nBangladesh Agricultural \nDevelopment Corporation \n\nAgricultural Diversification and \nIntensification Project \n\n1997\u20132004 \n\nDAE, LGED \n\nAquaculture Development Project \n\n1998\u20132004 \n\nMOFL \n\n1996\u20132001 \n\nMOA \n\nFAO \n\nFAO \n\nGTZ \n\nIFAD \n\nIFAD \n\nUSAID \n\n$256,500 \n\n$5.7 million \n\n$7.5 million \n\n$18.9 million \n\n$23.8 million \n\n$10.0 million \n\n2003\u20132008 \n\nMinistry of Commerce \n\nGTZ \n\n\u20ac13.0 million \n\n2001\u20132005 \n\nMOA \n\nUSAID \n\n$37.0 million \n\nAgro-based Technology \nDevelopment Project I \n\nAgro-based Technology \nDevelopment Project II \n\nAgricultural Services, Innovation \nand Reform Project  \n\n1999\u20132003 \n\nDAE, Horticulture Export \nDevelopment Foundation \n\nWorld Bank, \nDFID, FAO \n\n$12.4 million \n\nExport Diversification Project \n\n1999\u20132003 \n\nWorld Bank \n\nTk169.8 million \n\nMinistry of Commerce, \nTariff Commission \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CIDA  =  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  DAE  =  Department  of \nAgricultural Extension, Danida = Danish International Development Assistance, DFID = Department for International \nDevelopment, FAO = Food and Agriculture Organization, GTZ = Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit, IFAD \n=  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  Development,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  KfW  = \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau,  LGED  =  local  government  engineering  department,  MOA  =  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nMOFL  =  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock,  PKSF  =  Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation,  SDC  =  Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment  and  Cooperation,  SIDA  =  Swedish  International  Cooperation  Development  Agency,  USAID  =  United \nStates Agency for International Development. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS \nAND WHOLESALE BANKS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  work  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  that  have  developed \nsound  microcredit  loan  portfolios,  and  are  seeking  to  expand  their  portfolio  of  small-scale \nindividual  lending  to  agribusiness.  Wholesale  banks,  which  will  be  expected  to  conform  to \nselected performance criteria, will finance the NGOs through lending.  \n \n2. \n\nTo be selected and participate in the Project, wholesale banks must have: \n(i) \n\nat  least  3  years  experience  in  project-relevant  financing,  including  a  steadily \nincreasing portfolio of NGO or nonbank financial institution lending; \nclassified loans1 accounting for less than 10% of total loans outstanding; \nat  least  3  years  of  satisfactory  financial  performance,  as  shown  by  financial \nstatements audited to international accounting standards, as well as satisfactory \nfinancial forecasts for the current year and each subsequent year of the project \nparticipation  that  indicate  profitability  and  the  maintenance  of  prudent  financial \nratios;  \na  capital  adequacy  ratio2  of  at  least  9%,  plus  satisfactory  compliance  with \nBangladesh Bank regulatory and inspection requirements; \na maximum loan deposit ratio3 of 1.0; and \na  proven  ability  to  monitor  and  regularly  report  financial  and  physical  indicators \nneeded to measure project status and impact. \n\n \n3. \nThe maximum loan deposit ratio for the wholesale bank will be calculated excluding the \nportion  of  loan  portfolio  financed  by  project  borrowing.  Before  a  wholesale  bank  joins  the \nProject,  and  for  each  year  of  participation,  the  bank  should  perform  in  accordance  with  the \nstandards set in para. 2 for which Bangladesh Bank has supervisory responsibility. \n \n4. \n\nTo be selected and participate in the Project, NGOs must have: \n(i) \n\na level of governance and internal controls that clearly demonstrate an ability to \nmanage  and  account  for  financial  intermediation  operations  separate  from,  and \nindependently of, other activities carried out by the NGO; \nsatisfactory  compliance  with  standards  and  instructions  issued  by  Bangladesh \nBank for NGOs involved in microfinance; \na strategy statement within their corporate plan that shows a commitment to the \ndevelopment of agribusiness financial services;  \nsatisfactory work plans for the next 3 years, showing project-related activities to \nbe undertaken and their relationship with all other activities of the NGO;  \nfinancing services to at least 100,000 borrowers before project participation;  \nat  least  5  years  of  satisfactory  financial  performance  and  at  least  3  years  of \nsatisfactory  experience  with  microenterprises, as  shown  by  financial statements \nand satisfactory external audit reports;  \nsound  and  transparent  subborrower  selection  procedures,  including,  in  the \nfinancing of production-related services, a detailed and time-bound plan that will \nresult  in  the  commercial  packaging  of  these  services  and  their  ownership  by \nprivate sector entrepreneurs; \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n                                                 \n1 Loans that are classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. \n2  Capital  adequacy  ratio  is  a  measure  of  a  financial  institution\u2019s  financial  strength,  particularly  its  ability  to  cushion \n\noperational and abnormal losses. It is derived by comparing the ratio of an entity\u2019s equity with its asset-at-risk. \n\n3 The amount of a bank's loans divided by the amount of its deposits at any given time. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nsatisfactory  financial  statements  for  the  current  year,  and  forecasts  for  each \nsubsequent  year  of  project  participation,  which  indicate  profitability  and  the \nmaintenance of prudent financial ratios (profitability will be measured by a return \non equity averaged over 2 years of not less than 6 percentage points above the \nrate of inflation and an expenses-to-revenue ratio of not more than 90%); \na net worth of at least Tk120 million, and capital adequacy of not less than 12%; \nand \nclassified loans accounting for less than 10% of total loans outstanding. \n\n(x) \n \n5. \nThe Asian Development Bank has conducted a due diligence review to compile a short \nlist of NGO candidates for participation in the Project. The shortlist follows eligibility guidelines \nestablished for the Project. Wholesale banks will review the loan application of each NGO. If an \napplication  is  considered  bankable,  the  banks  will  determine  how  much  to  loan  the  NGO  in \naccordance with own loan management procedures, which will have been modified with project \nassistance.  The  wholesale  banks  will  bear  the  credit  risk  of  NGO  lending,  and  will  financially \nmonitor  these  NGOs  and  provide  summarized  reports  to  project  implementation  unit  (PIU). \nNGOs  will  be  required  to  provide  summarized  reports  on  social  and  financial  aspects  of  their \nproject  activities  to  PIU.  With  consultant  assistance,  PIU  will  determine  the  content  and \nfrequency of these summarized reports. In addition, PIU will randomly inspect NGO head office \nand field office activities to ensure sound and transparent subborrower selection procedures are \nbeing followed. \n \n6. \nPIU  will  work  closely  with  the  wholesale  banks  in  the  first  3  months  to  (i)  develop \nguidelines  and  procedures  to  be  followed  in  evaluating  and  accepting  NGO  proposals;  (ii) \nestablish  priorities  in  the  selection  of  proposals;  (iii)  establish  performance  and  project  benefit \nindicators, as well as a process of monitoring these regularly through NGOs; and (iv) formulate \nsteps to be followed if an NGO ceases to perform satisfactorily. PIU and the wholesale banks \nwill work out a procedure to follow that will enable a sample check of subborrowers to ensure \nthat agribusiness is being financed, and that funds are not being diverted elsewhere. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n($ Million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTotal \n\nLocal \n\n2,064.5 \n974.9 \n\n\u2014 \n88.2 \n88.2 \n37.0 \n41.4 \n\n  a.

The  implementation  of  Credit  for  Small-Scale  Agribusinesses  (component  1) \nwill  depend  on  the  participation  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO).  NGOs  interested  in \npromoting agribusiness will be able to borrow from a credit line established in Bangladesh Small \nIndustries  and  Commerce  (BASIC)  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank.  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank, \nwhich  will  bear  the  credit  risk  for  the  NGO  credit  line,  will  select  the  participating  NGOs.  To \nassist  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  in  the  selection  process,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  identified  and  conducted  due  diligence  on  three  of  the  most  qualified  and  experienced \nNGOs\u2014each of which would be likely to participate in the Project. NGOs on this shortlist will be \nconsidered for the initial drawdown from the credit line. Additional NGOs may be considered for \nparticipation following the midterm review, provided they meet selection criteria (Appendix 4). \n \nBASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  will  review  the  loan  applications  of  each  NGO  to \n2. \ndetermine the amount of funds to be onlent. If an application is considered bankable, the banks \nwill determine the amount of the loan, following their own loan management procedures. These \nprocedures  will  be  modified  with  project  assistance  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Project,  while \nkeeping in mind the financial soundness of the onlending institutions. BASIC Bank and Eastern \nBank  will  financially  monitor  the  NGOs  and  provide  summarized  reports  to  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). The wholesale banks will inform PIU of the amounts lent, while the \nNGOs  will  inform  PIU  what  their  intended  agribusiness  development  and  lending  targets  are. \nNGOs will be required to provide to PIU summarized reports on the social and financial aspects \nof  their  project  activities.  With  the  assistance  of  the  project  monitoring  consultants,  PIU  will \ndetermine  the  content  and  frequency  of  these  summarized  reports.  PIU  will  report  this \ninformation to the Ministry of Agriculure (MOA), which will pass it along to ADB. As part of the \nmonitoring  process,  PIU  will  randomly  inspect  NGO  field  activities  to  ensure  that  the  target \ngroup of the project is being reached.  \n \n3. \nLending  Terms  and  Conditions  for  the  Credit  Line.  The  Government  will  relend \n$36 million equivalent in local currency to BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank at an annual service \ncharge of 3.5% on the outstanding balance of disbursements from the Government. Loan terms \nand  conditions  will  be  set  out  in  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Government  and \nBASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank.  The  wholesale  banks  and  NGOs  will  borrow  and  repay  their \nloans  in  local  currency,  free  of  foreign  exchange  calculations.  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank \nwill  onlend  to  participating  NGOs  at  the  cost  of  funds  from  the  Government,  calculated  on  a \nsimple interest basis plus the 3.5% spread. The rate charged to the NGOs will be 7%, the same \nas the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation charges larger NGOs. BASIC Bank and Eastern Bank \nwill have a margin to cover the higher administrative and monitoring expenses associated with \nNGO and subproject lending, as well as provisions for bad and doubtful debt, and an adequate \nprofit  margin.  As  loan  security,  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  stated  that  personal  and \ncorporate guarantees, supplemented where available by security over property and receivables, \nare accepted for lending to NGOs. Their primary focus will be on NGO cash flows available for \nloan repayment. Participating NGOs will borrow from BASIC Bank or Eastern Bank, and onlend \nto  their  subborrowers  to  finance  agribusiness activities.  The  service  charge  for  this  lending  by \nNGOs  will  be  at  the  prevailing  market  rate,  which  takes  into  account  social  mobilization, \ntechnical support, and financial service costs to ensure continuing operational viability. After 1 \nyear, the Government and ADB will review the performance of the NGOs, and the impact of the \nservice charge they imposed upon the subborrowers, for taking further action, if necessary. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\n \n4. \nThe lending terms for participating NGOs will be based on the business plans submitted \nto  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank.  Drawdowns  for  seasonal  and  short-term  finance  may  be \nrolled over, subject to satisfactory performance by participating NGOs. At project completion, all \noutstanding  lending  to  participating  NGOs,  which  is  unclassified  according  to  Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s  standards,  will  be  placed  in  revolving  funds  in  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank.  These \nwould  continue  to  be  available  to  NGOs  for  agribusiness  activities.  Repayment  of  funds  by \nBASIC Bank and Eastern Bank would repay funds to the Ministry of Finance out of the revolving \nfund, which would close with a zero balance when ADB decides to dissolve the revolving fund. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements for Technical and Marketing support for \nAgribusiness (Component 2) \n\n \n5. \nThe  agribusiness  promotion  consultants\u2014working  with  NGOs,  entrepreneur \nassociations,  and  larger  entrepreneurs  that  can  be  linked  to  small  entrepreneurs  in  the  value \nchain\u2014will  provide  and  develop  the  technical  and  marketing  supports  under  Training  and \nSupport for Small Entrepreneurs (component 2a) through PIU. NGOs also will be encouraged to \nsubmit  their  own  proposals  for  project  support  to  improve  their  services  for  agribusiness \nborrowers  and/or  direct  services  for  their  borrowers.  Proposals  developed  by  the  consultants \nand by NGOs, with the assistance of consultants for component 2a, will be submitted to a panel \nfor review and approval. The panel will comprise the project manager, the project management \ntraining  advisor  (or  his/her  nominee),  and  the  NGO  associated  with  the  proposal.  The  project \nmanagement  training  advisor,  in  consultation  with  participating  NGOs,  will  establish  the \nguidelines for approving proposals and monitoring procedures. \n \n6. \nStrengthening of agribusiness associations and agribusiness information and technology \ndissemination  (components  2b  and  2c)  will  be  implemented  based  on  proposals  submitted  to \nPIU.  The  proposals  will  specify  what  the  training,  capacity  strengthening,  or  governance \nimprovement  needs  are,  and  the  types  of  promotional  services  the  associations  or  service \nproviders will provide. Funding will be shared. Approvals for component 2b will be based on the \nprovision of some reciprocal service, such as participation in the training program for MOA staff \nor participation in one of the other activities under component 2 (e.g., the provision of technical \nadvice). A committee comprising the project manager, the agribusiness promotion consultants, \nand the project management training advisor will vet the proposals for components 2b and 2c. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements for Strengthening Capacity of Participating NGOs \nand Wholesale Banks in Agribusiness Lending (Component 3) \n\n \n7. \nNGO  training  courses  will  be  designed  and  financed  based  on  requests  from,  and \nappraisal  of,  individual  NGOs.  The  agribusiness  finance  specialist,  agribusiness  promotion \nconsultants,  training  specialist,  gender  advisor,  women\u2019s  entrepreneur  promotion  specialist, \nenvironmental  and  social  advisor  and  specialists  will  deliver  the  courses.  Training  will  be \nprovided to the wholesale banks after the agribusiness finance specialist assesses the training \nneeds. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements for Improving the Enabling Environment for \nAgribusiness (Component 4) \n\n \nThe  agribusiness  cell  in  MOA  will  implement  identifying  and  correcting  major  policy \n8. \nconstraints  (component  4a)  for  the  regulatory  studies,  while  the  Department  of  Agricultural \nMarketing  (DAM)  will  implement  the  marketing  studies.  Consultants  will  be  selected  for  the \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nnecessary  background  studies,  and  to  assist  the  agribusiness  cell  in  drafting  any  revised \nregulations or legislation. The consultants also will assist in organizing consultations seminars, \nworkshops, or publicity drives needed to get the revised legislation adopted. For regulations or \nlegislation that are the  responsibility of other  ministries (for example the Ministries of Finance, \nCommerce, or Industry), a joint committee will be set up through the project steering committee \nto consider and redraft necessary recommended amendments. \n \n9. \nStrengthening  public  sector  agencies  in  agribusiness  governance,  support,  and \npromotion  (component  4b)  will  be  implemented  through  PIU.  A  domestic  training  specialist, \nassisted by an international training advisor, will prepare curricula and formulate links with the \nprivate sector and NGOs for courses. These will be designed to illustrate agribusiness potential, \nand  how  this  potential  relates  to  the  work  of  various  line  agencies,  especially  MOA  and  the \nMinistry of Fisheries and Livestock. The domestic training specialist then will ensure that training \ncourses are provided at regular intervals (approximately 20 sessions per year for 4 years). The \nagribusiness  cell  will  ensure  that  relevant  staff  of  MOA  and  its  line  agencies  are  exposed  to \ntraining when it is provided. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nimplementation support. \n \n\nProject Implementation Support (Component 5) \n\nthat  will  be  needed \n\nTable  A7.1  shows \n\nincremental  staff \n\nthe  project \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nTable A7.1: Incremental Staff Requirements \n\nNumber of Staff Needed \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTotal\n\nPosition \n \nA.

Most of the poor in Bangladesh live in rural areas, \nderiving  their  livelihood  from  agriculture.  Accelerating  agricultural  growth  will  be  impossible  if \nstrategies  continue  to  focus  mainly  on  production.  The  agriculture  sector  has  to  be  reoriented \ntowards agribusiness, including commercial production, processing, and marketing, to grow and \ngenerate large benefits to the rural economy and the poor. \n \n2. \nAgribusiness growth will increase employment and income in rural areas; stimulate farm \nand  nonfarm  activities,  such  as  agroprocessing,  marketing,  and  business  services;  establish \nvalue chain links among farmers, traders, and agroprocessors; and add value to products. The \nproject benefits will include (i) expanded employment and income in rural areas; (ii) increased \nprivate  investment  in  the  sector;  (iii)  improved  status  of  the  poor  and  women;  (iv)  improved \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  for  agribusiness  development;  (v) strengthened  agribusiness \nassociations; and (vi) improved provision of agribusiness services in rural areas. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nOpportunities  for  agribusiness  growth  exist  in  Bangladesh,  because  of  a  comparative \nadvantage  in  the  production  of  a  range  of  agricultural  commodities  and  because  of  a  growing \ndemand  for  a  variety  of  quality,  convenient,  and  high-value  products.  The  National  Private \nSector  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Bangladesh1  found  that  Bangladesh\u2019s  agribusiness  sector  is \ndominated  by  small-scale  units  in  production,  processing,  and  distribution.  An  estimated  2.6 \nmillion  small-scale  agribusinesses  are  scattered  throughout  Bangladesh\u201439%  of  which  (or \nabout  1  million  enterprises)  would  like  to  get  credit  support  and  are  confident  about  paying  it \nback. Most of the credit demand from the small-scale enterprises is estimated to be for loans of \n$500\u2013$5,000. If a small-scale agribusiness needs on average $2,500 equivalent for investment \nand operations, the total unmet credit demand is far more than any single project can offer. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial  Projection  and  Absorptive  Capacity  of  Participating  NGOs  and \nWholesale Banks \n\nUnmet Demand from Bankable Agribusiness Subprojects \n\n \n4. \nThe  size  of the  Project\u2019s  agribusiness  credit line  ($36  million)  is  based  on  the  financial \nprojection  and  absorptive  capacity  analysis  of  the  participating  NGOs.  The  three  NGOs  have \ndifferent  sets  of  factors  affecting  their  absorptive  capacity  for  lending,  as  envisaged  under  the \nProject.  Information  is  derived  from  the  due  diligence  performed  on  each  institution \n(Supplementary  Appendixes  C\u2013G).  Each  NGO  has  stated  an  intention  to  become  a  licensed, \ndeposit-taking  microfinance  institution  (MFI)  once  enabling  legislation  is  passed  at  the  end  of \n2005.  Each  has  at  least  3  years  experience  in  making  agribusiness  loans  to  individuals,  with \naverage  loan  sizes  of  $1,000\u2013$1,500.  The  loan  recovery  rate  of  99%  is  similar  to  their  more \ntraditional  group-based  lending.  Agribusiness  lending  has  been  developed  cautiously.  The \nforecasted growth rate in lending has been scaled back to 85\u201390% of the rate over the last 3 \nyears.  For  each  NGO,  proposed  project  financing  will  be  less  than  6%  of  its  liabilities.  The \nProject has at least as much to do with building institutional capacity in agribusiness lending as \n\n                                                 \n1  Daniels,  Lisa.  2003.

In  real  terms,  ASA\u2019s  loan  portfolio  has \ngrown  22%  annually  in  the  last  3  years,  with  much  of  this  expansion  being  funded  out  of \nretained earnings. The projected rate of growth during project implementation has been scaled \nback  to  17.5%.  Individual  and  agribusiness  lending  is  projected  to  grow  at  the  same  rate  as \nother  lending,  remaining  at  10%  of  the  total  loan  portfolio.  The  projection  indicates  that,  even \nwith a reduction in the loan interest rate, much of ASA\u2019s future growth will continue to be funded \nout  of  retained  earnings.  Agribusiness  lending  is  estimated  to  increase  by  Tk1,465  million  by \n2011,  and  half  of  this  (Tk733  million)  would  be  eligible  for  project  financing.  Project  financing \nwould  represent  5.3%  of  ASA\u2019s  liabilities.  Agribusiness  lending  would  be  4%  of  the  loan \nportfolio.  If  agribusiness  lending  were  to  increase  to  5%,  project  borrowing  could  increase  to \nTk880  million.  In  2011,  borrowing  from  all  sources  is  estimated  to  be  11%  of  ASA\u2019s  loan \nportfolio,  compared  with  27%  in  2004.  Debt  financing  is  not  seen  as  being  a  problem. \nManagement and loan administration skills are highly capable, and governance is sound. ASA \ncontinues to be financially viable under a range of alternative scenarios. The capital adequacy \nratio (CAR) is never less than 38%, and the return on equity is generally above 15%, even with \na reduction in interest rate charged on lending. \n \n6. \nBRAC.  As  envisaged,  BRAC\u2019s  loan  portfolio  will  grow  15%  annually  during  project \nimplementation,  which  is  not  high  by  NGO  standards.  Agribusiness  lending  will  increase  from \n12%  of  all  lending  to  15%  by  2012.  An  estimated  20%  of  individual  lending  (Tk1,260  million\u2013\nTk1,340  million)  will  be  project-relevant.  This  amount  of  financing  would  be  less  than  4.5%  of \ntotal  liabilities.  In  2004,  Tk6,240  million  was  disbursed  in  the  unnoti  (\u201ceconomy\u201d)  and  progoti \n(\u201cprogress\u201d)  programs,  and  loan  recovery  is  highly  satisfactory.  Financial  projections  under  a \nrange of scenarios remain strong. CARs are always in excess of 30%, and the return on equity \nis more than a minimal 12%. The net profit of Tk533 million is expected to reach Tk1,866 million \nby  2011.  Financial  systems  and  their  management  and  governance  are  sound.  The  major \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nconcern  is  the  ability  of  BRAC  to  find  sources  of  borrowing  needed  to  finance  asset  growth. \nSecurity is adequate: loan receivables are never less than 2.5 times borrowing. If Palli Karma-\nSahayak  Foundation  (PKSF)  does  not  increase  its  lending,  BRAC  will  need  to  scale  back  its \nannual growth in group lending, reducing overall lending growth to about 12%. This would mean \nborrowing Tk1,260 million\u2013Tk6,060 million from the Project through commercial banks. If BRAC \nbecame a deposit-taking MFI, its deposits would bridge much of the gap in financing, enabling \nannual 15% growth in lending to be financed. \n \nThengamara Mohila Sabuj Sangha (TMSS). The annual growth rate in TMSS lending \n7. \nis forecasted at 20% during project implementation. In 2004, agribusiness lending was 7% of its \nloan  portfolio,  and  this  is  expected  to  grow  to  21%  by  project  completion.  In  2012,  half  of  the \nexpected  Tk660  million  in  agribusiness  would  be  eligible  for  project  financing,  which  would \namount to 6.5% of total liabilities. In 2012, borrowing would total Tk1,394 million (an increase of \nTk915 million from 2004), which is estimated at 42% of its loan portfolio, compared with 54% at \npresent.  TMSS  is  not  part  of  the  group  of  large  NGOs,  and  it  has  reduced  its  interest  rates. \nThus, PKSF is expected to finance much of the increased group-based borrowing. Although the \nCAR  remains  above  35%,  return  on  equity  will  decline  from  29%  to  15.7%  in  2012.  This  is \nlargely  due  to  a  graduated  decrease  in  interest  charged  on  lending.  Overall  financial \nperformance remains sound. Net profit of Tk91 million will increase  steadily to Tk207 million in \n2012.  Governance  and  internal  controls,  which  are  sound  but  cumbersome,  will  be  tested  as \nTMSS  disentangles  its  microfinance  operations  from  many  social  interventions.  This  is \ncomplicated by a need  to improve information technology to reduce the reporting time, and  to \nimprove management access to information.  \n \nBASIC  Bank.  BASIC  Bank  was  chosen  as  a  wholesaler  because  it  has  (i)  low \n8. \nadministrative  expenses  on  its  lending;  (ii)  efficient  and  profitable  financial  intermediation;  (iii) \nexperience in working with aid agency-funded projects; and (iv) the confidence of, and lends to, \nNGOs.  Financial  projections  show  that  BASIC  Bank\u2019s  strong  financial  indicators  will  continue. \nAnticipated project financing will represent 3% of its liabilities and the project NGO portfolio will \nbe  3.4%  of  its  lending.  With  six  corporate  borrowers  with  average  loan  sizes  of  more  than  $5 \nmillion,  BASIC  Bank  has  experience  in  making  large  individual  loans.  All  these  loans  are \nunclassified. However, the anticipated net worth of BASIC Bank to 2011 will limit loan exposure \nto a single NGO to around $8 million\u2013$9 million, which is less than the amount BRAC is likely to \nrequest in a year. \n \n9. \nEastern  Bank.  Eastern  Bank  is  a  private  commercial  bank  whose  management  team \ngained  extensive  experience  from  working  with  highly  reputable  foreign  banks.  The  Board  of \nDirectors fully supports the team. Since 2001, Eastern Bank steadily has improved the quality of \nits loan portfolio and streamlined its operations. Administration expenses on earning assets are \n1.7\u20132.1%, while the CAR is more than 16%. Anticipated project financing will represent 1.3% of \ntotal liabilities, 1.3% of Eastern Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio, and 1% of total assets. The net worth \nof Eastern Bank allows it to make loans to individual borrowers of up to $6.3 million. By 2010, \nwith  the  anticipated  increase  in  net  worth,  this  limit  will  cover  individual  NGO  loans  up  to  $16 \nmillion. \n \nD. \n \n\nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nRepresentative Enterprises Analysis \n\n \n10. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  stimulate  commercial  activities  in  the  agriculture  sector \nranging from preproduction support through commercial production to postproduction handling, \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nprocessing, transport, storage, and marketing. Demand will drive the investments, which will be \nidentified  during  implementation.  As  a  result,  the  likely  mix  of  the  scale  and  types  of \ninterventions, and the project benefits, cannot be ascertained accurately. Thus, a full-scale cost-\nbenefit  analysis  would  be  impractical.  Instead,  financial  analyses  were  conducted  on \nrepresentative agribusinesses that the private sector could implement under the Project. NGO \nstaff  will  be  trained  to  appraise  each  subproject  to  ensure  its  viability  and  compliance  with \nenvironmental and social safeguards of ADB and the Government. \n \nAs  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  the  representative  enterprise  analysis  is \n11. \nbased on the enterprise budget model with breakdown on  revenue and cost by the enterprise \noutputs  and  inputs,  as  well  as  projected  cash  inflows  and  outflows  over  10  years  priced  at \nconstant 2005 prices. The enterprise capacity is assumed to be realized by scaling up, with full \ncapacity reached in the third year. The cost structure of an enterprise usually consists of fixed \ninvestment (machinery, building, and land where applicable) and operating costs (raw materials, \nlabor,  electricity,  repair  and  maintenance,  depreciation,  loan  repayment,  transport,  and \nmiscellaneous  expenses).  Sensitivity  analysis  has  been  done  to  identify  some  of  the  major \nbusiness  factors,  and  to  evaluate  the  impact  changes  in  these  factors  would  have  on  each \nenterprise.  The  analysis  finds  that  agribusiness  investment  is  profitable,  sustainable,  and \ngenerates substantial and permanent employment for the rural poor. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Development Impacts \n\n \n12. \nThe  cumulative  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  economy  will  be  significant  through  direct \nincreases  in  production,  increases  in  value  added,  and  employment  generation.  In  addition  to \nincreases  in  gross  domestic  product,  economic  benefits  will  include  an  increase  of  around \n70,000 new jobs (para. 13). Additional indirect economic benefits will accrue from (i) increased \nproduction  generated  by  the  availability  of  better  support  services;  (ii)  increased  demand  for \nagricultural  produce  for  processing  and  urban  sales,  resulting  in  higher  producer  prices  and \ngreater  quantities  of  produce  marketed;  and  (iii)  multiplier  effect  generated  through  greater \ndemands  for  on-farm  labor,  transport,  storage,  and  handling.  Disadvantaged  segments  of  the \ncommunity  will  benefit  from  the  increased  labor  demand  and  increased  demand  for  farm \nproduce. They also will benefit directly through the promotion of intensive agribusiness activities \n(e.g., dairy, poultry raising, and fish farming) that do not require significant land. \n \n\n3. \n\nEmployment Generation and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\n \nThe Project will assist the start-up or expansion of at least 28,000 small agribusinesses. \n13. \nThis  assumes  that  each  credit  package  to  the  individual  enterprise  will  be,  on  average,  about \nTk160,000, and that the credit will revolve at least once during the 5-year life of the Project. In \naddition  to  maintaining  existing  employees,  each  subloan  will  generate  on  average  2.5  new \njobs. Thus, 70,000 new jobs (or 350,000 person-years) are expected to be generated from the \nProject.  If  credit  is  disbursed  and  recycled  expeditiously,  the  employment  generation  could  be \nmuch  higher.  The  generated  jobs  will  be  primarily  in  rural  areas  where  53%  of  the  population \nlives in poverty. \n \n14. \nThe  entrepreneurs  will  review  their  costs  and  hire  very  poor  people  to  lower  their \noperating  costs.  More  than  60%  of  labor  requirements  of  the  financed  enterprises  will  be  for \nmanual  and  low-skilled  workers  who  will  be  poor,  according  to  estimates.  Manual  labor  is \nneeded  for  tasks  such  as  carrying  inputs  and  outputs,  weeding,  irrigating,  and  operating  feed \nand  oil  mills.  Necessary  labor  skills,  apart  from  the  skills  of  the  entrepreneurs,  will  be  learned \non-the-job.  These  include  working  with  dairy  cows,  producing  milk  by-products,  working  in \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nnurseries, and working in broiler houses. Though the wage rates paid for this type of labor are \nattractive  only  to  the  poor,  the  average  wage  paid  is  Tk115\u2013Tk130  per  working  day,  which  is \nwell above the average of Tk65 per day for casual labor. \n \nAdditional  indirect  poverty-reduction  impacts  will  come  from  employment  and  higher \n15. \nincomes  generated  by  demand  for  produce  and  services,  such  as  transport,  handling,  and \nstorage  needed  for  the  operation  of  the  new  enterprises.  Since  the  demand  will  be  mostly  for \nsemiskilled and unskilled labor, a high proportion of those employed certainly will be poor. The \ndemand  for  raw  materials  also  will  generate  some  indirect  impacts.  This  will  stimulate \nproduction, thus generating additional employment and income-earning opportunities. \n \n16. \nBeyond the provision of a daily wage, poverty-reduction impacts also will be generated. \nFull-time  employment  will  provide  the  possibility  of  sustained  economic  and  social  betterment. \nPreviously unskilled laborers will have the opportunity to learn skills and develop a craft, while \nsemiskilled  workers  will  be  able  to  perfect  the  skills  they  already  have.  With  regular  incomes, \nboth  groups  of  workers  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  provide  skills  and  an  education  to  their \nchildren, helping their families out of poverty. \n \n\n4. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Impacts \n\n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  policy  environment  by  identifying  and \n17. \nrectifying specific regulatory constraints that impede agribusiness. These will include (i) import \nand  export  regulations,  (ii)  market  management,  (iii)  access  to  technology,  (iv)  information \ndissemination, and (v) other constraints identified by the agribusiness stakeholders. \n \n18. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  strong  positive  effect  on  the  institutional  environment  through \nmeasures  including  (i)  institutional  strengthening  of  NGOs  in  providing  agribusiness  credit;  (ii) \nenhanced  NGO  technical  training;  and  (iii)  training  for  staff  of  the  wholesale  banks  in \nagribusiness lending to NGOs. The Project will train the line agency staff in the importance of \nagribusiness,  as  well  as  their  potential  role  in  (i)  encouraging  commercial  activities  in  the \nagriculture sector, (ii) strengthening agribusiness organizations, and (iii) enhancing the capacity \nof NGO staff and trainers in promoting agribusiness investments among small borrowers. The \nestablishment of an agribusiness cell in the Ministry of Agriculture and the establishment of the \nproject  implementation  unit  in  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  (DAM)  also  will \nstrengthen  the  institutional  environment  for  agribusiness  development  by  providing  an \ninstitutional  focal  point  for  further  investment  and  aid  agency  involvement  in  agribusiness \nexpansion. \n \n\n5. \n\nImpacts on NGOs Scaling Up to Efficient MFIs and Rural Financing \n\n \nBy  providing  credit  and  technical  support  to  the  project  subborrowers,  the  participating \n19. \nNGOs  will  diversify  and  strengthen  their  loan  portfolios  based  on  a  long-term  and  stable  debt \nliability  structure.  The  project  targets  are  in  line  with  the  corporate  goal  of  the  participating \nNGOs\u2014scaling up to become efficient MFIs. \n \n20. \nThe  participating  NGOs  will  be  strengthened  financially.  Although  they  already  have \nsound financial performance indicators, they have depended on aid agency and grant funding. \nConsequently,  they  have  not  developed  the  commercial  links  with  the  banking  sector  that  are \nnecessary  for  any  viable  enterprise  or  institution.  Such  links  will  expose  them  to  rigorous \nfinancial  and  managerial  reviews  by  bank  lenders.  Their  dependence  on  aid  agency  funding, \nfurthermore,  makes  them  vulnerable  to  pressures  to  finance  microenterprises  at  cheap  and \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nProject Sustainability \n\nunsustainable  interest  rates  and/or  to  restrict  their  activities  to  segments  of  society  or \ngeographical areas targeted by government planners. Their participation in the Project will help \nthese  NGOs  to  improve  their  financial  management,  asset  and  liability  structures,  and \nprofitability  to  ensure  access  to  a  broader  and  continuing  range  of  sources  of  financing.  This \nalso will enable them to service debt, while maintaining sound debt-equity ratios. The provision \nof long-term debt will assist greatly these NGOs in their long-range planning and development \nof  individual  borrower  loan  products  needed  in  the  market.  The  strengthening  of  these  NGOs \nwill encourage the Government to proceed with its legislative program to support the emergence \nof sound and sustainable MFIs. \n \n21. \nThe  Project  is  a  pioneering  effort  to  use  the  banking  system  to  channel  funds  through \nreputable  and  experienced  NGOs  to  small-scale  agribusiness  entrepreneurs,  who  traditionally \nhave been  unable to access finance for their ventures. The successful growth of agribusiness \nlending through experienced NGOs will demonstrate to policymakers that the key to expanding \nrural  financial  services  is  engaging  capable  institutions  with  the  financial  and  managerial \nstrengths  to  respond  to  the  growing  demands  of  the  market.  The  Project  will  facilitate  a  new \navenue  for  a  vibrant,  crucial,  and  important  section  of  the  country\u2019s  private  sector  to  access \nfinance. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nInstitutional  Sustainability.  Through  its  training  components  and  strengthening  of \nDAM,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  developing  capacity  within  the  public  sector,  the  nonprofit \nprivate  sector  (through  its  support  to  NGOs),  and  the  profit-based  private  sector  (through \nto  serve  and  support  agribusiness \nagribusiness  associations  and  wholesale  banks) \ndevelopment. By the end of the Project, these public and private entities will be in a position to \ncontinue providing services to the commercial enterprises in the agriculture sector. \n \nFinancial Sustainability. The financial projections indicate that, throughout the Project, \n23. \nthe  NGOs  and  wholesale  banks  will  be  in  compliance  with  prudential  financial  indicators \nestablished  by  Bangladesh  Bank.  The  projected  financial  statements,  with  the  financial \nmanagement  assessments,  indicate  that  the  financial  institutions  have  sufficient  financial  and \nmanagerial capacity. The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. \n \n24. \nInvestment Sustainability. Regarding the sustainability of credit-financed investments, \nthe enterprises sponsored by the Project, as private sector ventures, will continue to operate on \na self-sustaining and financing basis as long as they are profitable. Undoubtedly, some attrition \nwill  occur,  but  their  success  will  not  depend  on  support  or  inputs  from  the  public  sector.  No \nspecial  subsidies  or  preferential  treatment  will  be  involved.  Thus,  on  the  whole,  the  project \ninvestments  will  be  sustainable  as  long  as  the  enterprises  are  properly  run  in  a  favorable \nfinancial and regulatory environment. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinks to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?  \n\nYes \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national  priority  in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement? \n \n\nYes \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Bangladesh: \n \nDespite Bangladesh\u2019s considerable success in reducing poverty during the 1990s, around half of the population still lives \nin  poverty.  Poverty  is  mostly  rural,  with  85%  of  the  poor  population  living  in  the  countryside.  In  rural  areas,  53%  of \npeople live in poverty, compared with 36% in urban areas. Further, poverty in rural areas is twice as severe as in urban \nareas. A majority of the rural population depend on agriculture, but the low base of agribusiness development remains a \nhurdle for growing the agriculture sector, as well as the national economy. \n \nAgriculture remains a fundamental sector of the economy, accounting for 22% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2002  and  more  than  50%  of  the  national  workforce.  When  forward  and  backward  links  are  taken  into  account,  the \ncontribution  of  agriculture  and  agribusiness  to  GDP  is  estimated  at  about  35%,  while  the  contribution  to  employment \nexceeds 75%. Of the estimated 3 million agribusinesses in the country, 90% have less than 10 workers and 36% have \nonly one worker. Nonetheless, they are estimated to account for half of household income for about 15 million people. \n \nThe  draft  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  (PRSP)  recognizes  that  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  for  rapid  poverty \nreduction  are  to  (i)  develop  the  private  sector;  (ii)  facilitate  the  development  of  women  entrepreneurship;  and  (iii) \npromote employment of, and benefits to, the poor. The PRSP emphasizes the enhancement of agriculture and the rural \nnonfarm  sector  with  backward  and  forward  links  for  accelerating  rural  nonfarm  growth.  An  integrated  approach  with \nexpansion of the technology base, agroprocessing, marketing, infrastructure, information, human development, etc. has \nbeen  considered.  The  PRSP  points  out  the  importance  of  (i)  correcting  policy  distortions  that  hurt  rural  nonfarm \nactivities,  (ii)  creating  an  enabling  environment,  (iii)  opening  up  opportunities,  (iv)  reducing  risks,  and  (v)  expanding \ncredit  flow  to  rural  entrepreneurs.  Essentially,  these  are  key  elements  for  agribusiness  development.  Agribusiness \ndevelopment can contribute substantially to reducing rural and urban poverty by facilitating the creation of employment \nand income-generating opportunities within the agribusiness value chain, thereby contributing to the economic growth. \n \nThe  Agribusiness  Development  Project  (the  Project)  is  to  expand  rural  and  peri-urban  employment  opportunities  for \nadults, increase the value added of nontraditional crops and commodities, raise rural incomes, reduce the incidences of \nchild labor and worst form of child labor in existing economic activities, and reduce poverty by expanding the activities of \nrural  enterprises  engaged  in  commercial  agriculture  (and  its  backwards  and  forwards  links).  The  Project  aims  to  (i) \npromote  small-scale  agribusiness  activities  by  channeling  credit  and  providing  technical  supports  to  small-scale \nagribusinesses in rural areas  of the country  through reputable, experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (ii) \nstrengthen  agribusiness  associations  for  policy  dialogue  on  the  enabling  environment,  agribusiness  promotion,  and \ninformation dissemination; and (iii) improve the enabling environment for private sector entrepreneurs through legislative \nand regulatory changes, and reorientation training for the staff of public sector agencies. \n \nThe Project focuses on grassroots, rural-based entrepreneurs in the private sector. This is a key group with substantial \neconomic  growth  potential,  which  multilaterally  financed  projects  in  Bangladesh  have  neglected.  Agribusiness \ninvestments undertaken by these small-scale agribusinesses are expected to generate directly substantial employment \nopportunities, while increasing the demand for agricultural products. In turn, this will translate into demand for a broader \nrange  of  produce,  higher  prices,  additional  employment,  and  increased  rural  incomes.  Agribusiness  development  in \ngeneral also will support income generation of poor farmers engaged in agribusiness through improved organization of \nmarket  links,  supply  contract,  adoption  of  appropriate  pre-  and  post-harvest  agricultural  technology,  and  availability  of \nfinancing and services of facilitating agencies. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nIn rural Bangladesh, household poverty is associated mainly with small farms (or landlessness) and unstable (or casual) \nemployment.  Scarce  access  to  productive  assets,  especially  land,  and  loss  due  to  natural  calamities  are  key \ndeterminants  of  household  poverty.  Poor  households  typically  own  less  land  than  the  non-poor,  and  are  highly \nrepresented among the functionally landless. The incidence of poverty among landless and households  with less than \n0.05 acres is 67%. This rate decreases as land size increases. The scope for redistributing land to the poor, or bringing \nmore land under cultivation, is limited. Thus, measures aimed at improving land productivity and at promoting nonfarm \nactivities are considered the most feasible options for development. \n \n\n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nHigh incidence of casual wage labor, instead of permanent labor, is a severe burden for rural households. In rural areas, \nthe incidence of poverty in households  where the head is a causal laborer is 75% (compared with an average in rural \nareas of 53%). About half of the poor in rural areas lives in households where the main occupation of the head is casual \nwage  employment.  The  heads  of  one  quarter  of  the  poor  rural  households  are  self-employed  in  agriculture.  However, \npoverty  is  relatively  less  among  salaried  employees\u2014approximately  6%  of  the  rural  poor,  with  an  incidence  in  the \ncategory of 35%. Women are effectively the head of about 25% of the households, and among the poorest. Many poor \nmigrate  to  urban  areas  in  search  of  employment  due  to  unemployment  and  loss  of  productive  assets.  Still,  the \nagriculture sector provides employment for the majority of rural people, mainly due to the low employment opportunities \nin, and low absorptive capacities of, the other sectors. \n \nWhile a significant number of participants in different subsectors of agriculture are women, their participation in the labor \nforce is low as they are mainly involved in household-based or subsistence activities. Therefore, their income is low and \ncontribution  to  GDP  is  not  recognized.  A  considerable  gap  with  men  remains  in  literacy,  access  to  health  care,  and \nnutrition. A preliminary analysis during the project preparatory technical assistance found that women\u2019s participation in \nagribusiness is low and wage discrimination exists. The Project will be a remarkable opportunity to reduce the burden of \npoverty  on  women  in  Bangladesh.  The  potential  for  women  laborers  and  entrepreneurs  to  contribute  to,  and  benefit \nfrom, more commercial-oriented agribusiness activities is huge. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  poverty  by  (i)  focusing  on  rural  areas  and  small-scale  agribusinesses;  (ii)  prioritizing \nemployment  creation  in  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors;  (iii)  promoting  market  links,  which  will  increase  profitability  for \nsmallholder farmers; (iv) emphasizing partnership and supply contracts among NGOs and private sectors,  which have \npositive impacts on women and poor participation; and (vi) involving marginal areas during the dissemination campaign \nof project activities. \n \nFollowing  on  these  considerations,  special  emphasis  has  been  given  to  include  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries  in  the \nanalysis of project impact on poverty reduction. While the poor might benefit directly from the Project when involved in \nproject activities, they also can benefit indirectly as employees of beneficiary enterprises, as clients in the value chain, or \nas suppliers of agricultural goods and services. Besides, they can benefit from employment opportunities generated in \nsupportive manufacturing and servicing enterprise growth. For an ongoing analysis of the poverty reduction impact, the \nProject will utilize (i) baseline household and community surveys; (ii) records of NGOs and financial intermediaries; and \n(iii) participatory  techniques  with  a  special  focus  on  poor  farmers,  enterprise  employees,  women,  children,  and  ethnic \ngroups, to gather data and information on needs, assets, entrepreneurship potential, and vulnerability. \n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participatory process was adopted during project design for understanding the needs and the constraints of the poor \npopulation,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities  regarding  agribusiness  development.  This  consisted  of  an  extensive \nparticipatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA),  which  was  conducted  in  17  districts  of  the  country.  The  PRA  involved  farmers, \nfactory workers, and daily laborers. The PRA was complemented by informant interviews, which included managers of \nfactories, entrepreneurs, NGO officials, and representatives of chambers and associations. \n \nThe project implementation also will adopt a participatory approach. In particular, NGOs are expected to play a crucial \nrole  in  managing  the  credit  component  for  the  entrepreneurs,  and  providing  and/or  facilitating  other  services. \nAgribusiness promotional activities and capacity-building activities will be supported upon submission of proposals from \nassociations, NGOs, and facilitating agencies. In particular, to increase the exposure of the poor and vulnerable groups \n(such as women, tribal communities, and remote area farmers) to the benefits of the Project, special care will be given to \nenhance their participation through intense dissemination activities and focused awareness campaign. For this purpose, \nthe Project will develop the capacity of associations, and assist in establishing links within private sector. \n \nThe  awareness  building  campaigns  will  involve,  among  others,  issues  of  child  labor  and  worst  form  of  child  labor \n(impacts and extent). The capacity initiatives will involve establishment of child-friendly environment in the private sector. \nMeasures will be undertaken to withdraw children from the worst form of child labor, and provide alternatives to them (in \neducation, training, and skills development) and their parents (in employment, access to credit, market, and services) for \nenhanced income to support their family. \n \nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen are likely to benefit from the Project through increases in (i) new employment possibilities at he household level \nin  agroprocessing  and  post-harvest  tasks;  (ii)  profitability  through  scaling  up  of  enterprises;  (iii)  access  to  financial \n\nParticipation Process \n\n    Yes               \n\nGender \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n   No  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nresources; (iv) income at household and/or enterprise level; (v) improved human capital and skills through training and \ncapacity building activities; and (vi) availability and quality of agricultural goods. \n \nThe  combination  of  these  effects  could  increase  significantly  the  overall  status  of  women  in  the  household  and  in \nsociety.  However,  various  constraints  might  prevent  or  reduce  benefits  to  women.  By  considering  women\u2019s  potential \ninvolvement  in  employment  opportunities,  attention  needs  to  be  given  to  (i)  social  and  cultural  constraints  that  limit \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  the  labor  force  and/or  business,  (ii)  economic  constraints  that  make  women  work  inside  the \nhousehold  for  children  care  and  housekeeping,  and  (iii)  facility  constraints,  which  prevent  women  from  accessing \nappropriate  facilities  in  work  or  the  market  place.  The  project  design  encompasses  several  general  strategies:  (i) \ndevelopment of backward and forward commercial links that are positively associated with the participation of women; \n(ii) collaboration with women entrepreneurs and women\u2019s associations; (iii) implementation of an awareness campaign \nfor  promoting  project  activities  among  women  borrowers  and  entrepreneurs;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for  institutions, \nNGOs,  associations,  groups,  financial  institutions,  and  women  to  facilitate  women\u2019s  access  and  participation  in \nagribusiness  and  agroprocessing.  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  girls  to  ensure  that  they  are  exempted  from  child \nlabor and worst form of child labor, and have greater access to education, health, and other social services. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nA gender action plan has been prepared in Appendix 15. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement \n\nNone \n\nAffordability  \n \n\nNot Significant \n\nLabor \n \n\nNot Significant \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNot Significant  Risks \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNot applicable. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  backward  and  forward  links  with \nproducers,  NGOs,  and  private  sector  service  providers  and/or \nentrepreneurs.  This  will  increase  the  availability  of  goods  and \nservices.  The  improvement  in  the  quality  of  the  final  product \nmight be reflected in an increase in its price. This effect does not \nraise  affordability  concerns  since  (i)  the  improvement  in  the \nquality  is  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  the  supply  of  the \ngoods,  and  (ii)  the  higher-quality  goods  are  oriented  towards \nnon-poor  consumers.  It  also  facilitates  increased  income  of  the \npoor through the support for scaling up their enterprises. \n \nThe  Project  will \nin \nagribusiness  for  men  and  women.  No  negative  impact  on  labor \nmarket is foreseen. At the same time, the prospects of economic \ngrowth and profitability might push farmers to involve child labor \nin  the  activities.  The  Project  will  ensure  close  monitoring  of  the \nconditions and activities of children in beneficiaries\u2019 households, \nand mobilize the necessary resources to prevent child labor and \nworst  form  of  child  labor.  Also,  the  diffusion  of  \u201cfair  trade\u201d \nprinciples and permanent jobs created for parents  will decrease \nthe incentives to utilize child labor. \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  indigenous \npeople.  The  adoption  of  a  demand-driven  approach  for  funding \nof interventions should allow participation of indigenous people. \n \n\nincrease  employment  opportunities \n\ninclude  political \n\ninstability,  weak  commitment \n\nto \ninadequate \nunderstanding  agribusiness  development,  and \ninstitutional  coordination.  The  capacity  to  improve  agribusiness \ndevelopment also is influenced by exposure to natural disasters, \nsuch  as  flooding  and  droughts.  The  project  focus  on  NGO-\noperated  credit  should  decrease  the  risk  of  difficulties  in \nthe \nrepayment  capacity.  Also, \ncoordination  among  stakeholders.  This  might  be  a  useful \nstrategy  for  coping  with  difficulties  associated  with  the  negative \neffects of natural disasters, such as floods and droughts. \n\nthe  Project  will  strengthen \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\n \n1. \nWomen\u2019s effective participation in the Agribusiness Development Project (the Project) is \nexpected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  social  development.  This  Gender  Action  Plan \n(GAP)  factors  gender  concerns  into  all  project  components  to  promote  women\u2019s  participation \nequally as agents and beneficiaries in the Project\u2019s development process. \n \n2. \nA  significant  share  of  the  participants  in  different  subsectors  of  agriculture  is  women, \nthough  women\u2019s  contributions  often  go  unrecognized.  The  GAP  aims  to  (i)  reduce  poverty \namong  women, \nin  agribusiness \ndevelopment, (iii) increase women\u2019s economic and social benefits from the Project, (iv) develop \nwomen  as  contributors  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth,  and  (v)  support  women\u2019s \nempowerment in decision-making and public life. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  support  women\u2019s  access  to  newer  employment  opportunities  in \nupstream  and  downstream  agribusiness  enterprises  and  services;  (ii)  increase  profitability \nprospects for  agro-entrepreneurs;  (iii)  increase household  income;  (iv)  improve  human  capital; \n(v) improve links with service institutions; and (vi) increase access to market, finance, and other \nresources.

If such earmarked funds are not utilized within 2.5 years from the \nstart of project implementation, they will revert to the general pool of funds. \n\u2022  NGOs will support a substantial number of women former microcredit borrowers \n\nunder the credit program for agribusiness. Agribusiness development ventures that \nwill create employment opportunities (at least two) for the poor and women will be \nsupported. \n\n\u2022  NGOs will support the preparation and revision of the business plan of former \n\nmicrofinance borrowers to scale up their activities as subborrowers of the targeted \ncredit program. \n\n \n\u2022  Raise awareness among potential entrepreneurs through periodic information \n\ncampaigns to inform them of the business services and credit line opportunities, as \nwell as agribusiness technologies. \n\n\u2022  Ensure that all the campaign messages are gender friendly, and a gender friendly \n\ndissemination methodology is used to reach women and men. \n\n\u2022  Organize periodic campaigns and information dissemination activities with \n\nappropriate messages to reach the associations and NGOs about the scope in \nagribusiness promotional activities. \n\n\u2022  NGOs will provide training and guidance to subborrowers on business planning, \n\npreparation of project proposal, financial control and reporting, business and credit \nmanagement, etc., for all women borrowers, as they require. \n\n\u2022  NGOs will provide technical training to all women subborrowers on livestock, \n\nfisheries, agronomy, storage, processing etc., as they require.

The  Project\u2019s  lending  and  onlending  rates  have  been  discussed  in \nAppendix 7. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will charge interest rates that allow full cost \nrecovery on loans to the subborrowers, which are small-scale agribusiness entrepreneurs. The \npractice  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Microfinance  Development \nStrategy,1  and  takes  into  consideration  key  lessons  learned  from  ADB  and  other  aid  agency \nprojects on micro and rural finance in Bangladesh and other countries: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  credit  line  should  provide  flexibility  to  participating  banks  and  NGOs  in \nsetting their interest rates to reflect credit risks of the respective clients.2 \nInterest rate and financial viability go hand to hand. Capping interest rates would \nconstrain  the  growth  in  microfinance  aimed  at  poverty  reduction.  Market \ncompetition should determine the interest rate, not the Government. 3 \n\n \nSustainability  of  NGO  Enterprise  Lending.  Sustainability  is  the  key  factor  that  ADB \n2. \nand  the  Government  should  consider  in  recommending  what  interest  rates  NGOs  should \ncharge.  For  the  Project,  NGOs  are  recommended  to  continue  determining  their  loan  pricing \naccording to market conditions and services being provided for cost recovery. This is to reduce \nthe  risk  of  political  intrusion  and  to  avoid  market  distortions.  With  a  market  focus,  financial \nservices and institutional relationships can be expected to sustain and expand after the Project. \nThe  financial  projections  for  the  participating  NGOs  show  that,  with  the  proposed  full  cost-\nrecovery  rates,  they  are  able  to  maintain  their  financial  integrity  while  increasing  market \noutreach. \n \n3. \nNGO  Cost  Structure.  NGO  lending  usually  carries  a  higher  rate  than  bank  lending, \nbecause of NGOs\u2019 higher delivery costs involved in smaller transactions delivered virtually to the \nsubborrowers location. Interest rates need to cover three basic types of costs: (i) cost of funds \nfor onlending; (ii) cost of risk (loan loss); and (iii) administrative costs (identifying and screening \nclients, processing loan applications, disbursing loans, collecting repayments, and following up \non non-repayment). Administration costs are inversely related to loan size, and usually exceed \n10%  of  the  amount  of  loan  for  small  loans.  Furthermore,  service  pricing  for  different  NGOs \nneeds  to  consider  NGO  product  differentiation.  Distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  NGOs \nthat  charge  weekly  or  monthly,  those  that  provide  grace  periods  for  principal,  and  those  that \nprovide  interest  rebates  to  proven  borrowers.  Several  other  factors  also  affect  the  pricing  of \nNGO  credit  in  Bangladesh:  (i)  natural  disasters,  (ii)  uncertainty  over  the  future  sources  of \nfinance  for  asset  expansion,  (iii) higher  cost  of  equity  financing,  (iv)  widespread  practice  of \ncross-subsidization  between  loan  products,  (v)  inclusion  of  social  and  technical  support  costs, \nand (vi) effect of taxation liabilities on NGOs becoming microfinance institutions. \n \n4. \nRepayment Capabilities of Subborrowers. The direct subborrowers of the Project will \nbe the small entrepreneurs, while ultra-poor people will benefit from the jobs created. By moving \ninto  the  market  for  small-scale  enterprises,  the  NGOs  have  seen  significant  potential  in  the \nmarket  if  service  can  be  provided  efficiently  at  reasonable  prices.  The  many  borrowers  (more \nthan  160,000)  of  NGOs\u2019  small  enterprise  program,  annual  lending  growth  of  more  than  20%, \nand the high repayment rate of at least 99% clearly show the demand for these loans and ability \nof the small entrepreneurs for loan repayment out of enterprise profits. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

A review of microfinance in different countries, \nincluding  Bangladesh,  shows  that  the  poor  generally  consider  ongoing  access  to  credit  more \nimportant than the cost of the credit. An interest rate ceiling often hurts, rather than protects, the \nmost  vulnerable  by  shrinking  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  financial  services.  An  interest  rate  cap \nintroduces market distortions, damages the sustainability of NGO lending, ignores fundamental \npricing calculations, and ignores NGO product differences. As a demonstration, the capping of \ninterest  rates  on  agricultural  lending  through  development  finance  institutions  (such  as \nBangladesh  Krishi  Bank  and  Rajshahi  Krishi  Unnayan  Bank)  and  nationalized  commercial \nbanks has weakened these financial institutions to the point of insolvency. It also has diminished \nseverely their impact on, and capacity for, rural financial intermediation. \n \n6. \nCompetition as the Mechanism for Lowering Interest Rates. Competition will be the \nmost  powerful  mechanism  for  lowering  credit  cost  and  interest  rates.  Under  the  Project,  the \nincreased supply of individual loans will increase competition between participating NGOs and \nbanks that downscale services. This will lead to more attractive pricing of small loans, as well as \na broader range of products and terms, to the benefit of users. Competition among NGOs, and \nfrom  banks  that  scale  down  their  operations,  will  lower  interest  rates.  In  principle,  price \nadjustments  should  not  be  enforced  externally,  especially  since  this  market  segment  of  NGO \nlending (of $500\u2013$5,000 loans) for agribusiness is relatively new. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  use  of  sound  commercial  banks  as  wholesalers  of  project  funds  provides  an \nalternative  and  sustainable  source  of  funds  for  larger  NGOs.  Wholesale  banks,  such  as \nBangladesh  Small  Industries  and  Commerce  (BASIC)  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank,  are  needed \nbecause NGOs in Bangladesh are not registered financial institutions and cannot source funds \ndirectly from the Ministry of Finance or Bangladesh Bank. Most NGO borrowing in Bangladesh \nhas been from Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF).4 Such dependency on a single source \nof  finance  leads  to  loss  of  autonomy  in  management,  as  well  as  in  the  design  and  pricing  of \nservices. This has occurred in many medium and small NGOs. \n \nThe  proposed  margin  of  3.5%  for  BASIC  Bank  and  Eastern  Bank  is  to  cover \n8. \nadministration  expenses, \nliabilities,  and  credit  risk.  The  average  cost  of \nadministration  on  earning  assets  for  these  wholesale  banks  is  2.0%,  which  is  lower  than  at \nprivate  commercial  banks  (about  3%).  The  loan-loss  provisioning  of  the  wholesale  banks  is \n1.5%. Furthermore, participating in such a long-term project increases the political risk threshold \nfar  more  than  with  short-term  lending.  This  must  be  taken  into  account,  along  with  risk  from \nnatural disasters and NGO institutional risk. Thus, the proposed margin of 3.5% is considered \nthe minimum acceptable figure for Bangladeshi conditions. \n \n9. \nThe proposed margin for the wholesale banks is consistent with other wholesaler rates. \nA review of margins charged by intermediaries wholesaling or retailing funds to NGOs shows a \ncommon margin of not less than 3.5%. In 2004, PKSF had an administration cost of 1.21% and \na remaining margin of 2.29% to cover loan loss and profit margin for a total of 3.5%. Citigroup is \ncharging BRAC a margin of 1.5% (above the treasury bill rate), plus 2.0% credit risk guarantee \nto  be  paid  to  Financierings-Maatschappij  voor  Ontwikkelingslanden,  a  Dutch  development \nfinancing agency, for a total of 3.5%. In its lending to NGOs in Central Asia, European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  is  charging  6-month  London  interbank  offered  rate  (now \n3.65%) plus a margin of 5.25% and a first time fee of 1%. This is an effective margin of not less \nthan 5.5%. \n\nincome \n\ntax \n\n                                                 \n4  As  discussed  in  para.  14  of  the  main  text,  limited  funds  are  available  in  the  market  that  NGOs  can  mobilize  to \n\nsupport agribusiness. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 22 September 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "TK1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n", "$0.0153 \nTK65.51 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nASA \nATDP \nBASIC \nCAR \nDAM \nDFI \nGAP \nGDP \nMFI \nMOA \nMOF \nMOFL \nNCB \nNCDP \nNGO \nNPSSEB \nPCB \nPIC \nPIU \nPKSF \nPPMS \nPRA \nPRSP \nPSC \nSMESDP \nTA \nTMSS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAssociation for Social Advancement \nagro-based technology development project \nBangladesh Small Industries and Commerce \ncapital adequacy ratio \nDepartment of Agricultural Marketing \ndevelopment finance institution \ngender action plan \ngross domestic product \nmicrofinance institution \nMinistry of Agriculture \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Fisheries and Livestock \nnationalized commercial bank \nNorthwest Crop Diversification Project \nnongovernment organization \nNational Private Sector Survey of Enterprises in Bangladesh \nprivate commercial bank \nproject implementation committee \nproject implementation unit \nPalli Karma-Sahayak Foundation \nproject performance management system \nparticipatory rural appraisal \npoverty reduction strategy paper \nproject steering committee \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program \ntechnical assistance \nThengamara Mohila Sabuj Sangha \n", "NOTES \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  June.
