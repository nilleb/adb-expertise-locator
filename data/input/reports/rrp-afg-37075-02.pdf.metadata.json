The \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n \nThe  Project  is to  (i)  rehabilitate  the  Qaisar-Bala  Murghab  section \n(90 kilometers) of the Herat-Andkhoy road, (ii) install toll facilities \nincluding  toll  plazas  and  weighing  machines  for  the  project  road, \n(iii) support human immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immune \ndeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  prevention  and  anti-human \ntrafficking  awareness  campaign, \nfor \nconstruction  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  (v)  provide  project \nmanagement support to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n \nMuch  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  infrastructure  has  been  destroyed  or \ndamaged  in  more  than  two  decades  of  conflict.  Damaged  roads \nbecame  bottlenecks  to  the  movement  of  people  and  goods. \nRestricted  movement  has  aggravated \nthe  division  and \ndisintegration of the country, as travel time and vehicle operating \ncost on roads significantly increased. The result is a virtual loss of \nefficient means of transport connecting Kabul to regional centers, \nand regional centers to remote villages. \n \nThe  Qaisar-Bala  Murghab  road  forms  part  of  the  Herat-Andkhoy \nroad, which is the last unpaved section of the national primary ring \nroad. The project area is one of the least developed areas that the \nring road touches. Due to its remoteness and extreme weather in \nwinter  and  summer,  the  project  area  is  still  in  need  of  continued \nhumanitarian  aid  and  assistance \nin  basic  social  services. \nImprovement to the road will facilitate provision of such services.  \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  coordinated  international  assistance  to \nimprove the road connecting Herat to Andkhoy, which will become \na  major  north-south  link  across  the  central  mountains,  and \nsignificantly  improve  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  transport \nsystem  in  Afghanistan.  The  improved  road  will  also  change \ntransport in the subregion. Together with international links to the \nCentral  Asian  republics,  Iran,  and  Pakistan  that  are  currently \nbeing improved, the road will form a major road transport corridor \nfrom Central Asia to the warm water ports in the south. The result \nwill reduce transport costs, and contribute to economic growth and\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nPeriod of Grant \nUtilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii\n\nthrough \n\npoverty  reduction  in  the  subregion.  The  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking resulting from improved road connectivity will be \nmitigated \nthe  component  on  HIV/AIDS/sexually \ntransmitted disease prevention and anti human trafficking. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  promote \neconomic  and  social  development  and  reduce  poverty  by \nrehabilitating  the  primary  road  network  damaged  during  two \ndecades of conflict and neglect.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.3  million  equivalent, \nincluding  physical  contingencies  and  interest  charges  during  the \ngrace  period.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $38.3 \nmillion,  representing  about  69%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency  cost  is  estimated  at  $17.0  million  equivalent,  or  about \n31% of the total cost.  \n \nConsidering the fact that the project area is the most remote and \npoorest  area  in  a  country  that  requires  highly  concessional \nassistance, \nthe  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance of $55 million will be provided on a full grant basis from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources denominated in special \ndrawing rights. \n \n\n \n1 January 2006 \u2500 31 December 2008 \n\n \nMinistry of Public Works (MPW ) \n \nThe  Project  will  be \nthe  existing  project \nimplemented  by \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  which  handles  the  ongoing  Kandahar-\nSpin  Boldak  Road  Project  and  the  road  component  of  the \nEmergency  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project.  MPW  will \nalso  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  at  the  site \ncomprising  two  engineers  and  one  office  administrator  to  liaise \nwith  the  project  management  consultants,  contractors,  the  local \ngovernment,  and  the  people  in  the  project  area.  The  PIU  staff, \nstationed \nfield,  will  handle  day-to-day  project \nimplementation.  \n \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  ADB  grant  will  finance  $55  million  of  the  foreign  exchange \nand local currency costs of the Project, excluding taxes and duties \nof $304,000 that will be incurred by the Government.  \n \n \n30 June 2008 \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nrequested \n\nimplementation, \n\nthe  Government \n\nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of \nproject \nflexible \napplication  of  such  guidelines,  including  a  shorter  bidding  period \nof  60  days  to  procure  civil  works  under  international  competitive \nbidding. All international procurements will be by the Government \nProcurement Unit operating under the Afghanistan Reconstruction \nand Development Services (ARDS). \n \nA  consultant  team  will  be  hired  to  help  MPW  implement  the \nProject. The team will (i) oversee overall project management; (ii) \nthe  procurement  of  civil  works;  (iii)  supervise \nassist  with \nconstruction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing \ndetailed  designs  prepared  by  contractors; \n(iv)  supervise \nimplementation of the HIV/AIDS component; (v) certify completed \nworks by force account as well as by contractors; (vi) provide on-\nthe-job  training  for  MPW  staff  assigned  to  the  consultant  team \nimplementing  and  supervising  the  training  component  of  the \nProject; and (vii) undertake benefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nAll  consultants  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nrecruiting  domestic  consultants.  Direct  selection  is  proposed  for \nthe  consulting  services \nfor  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring.  The  consulting  services  contract  will  be  awarded  to \nthe  same  firm  who  will  be  engaged  under  the  ongoing  Andkhoy-\nQaisar Road Project since the firm will be involved with the same \nAndkhoy-Herat road section.  \n \nThe Project will lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction \nimpacts. Direct impact will be on income generation and demand \nfor  unskilled \nthem  during \nconstruction  of  the  project  road.  Other  benefits  will  become \nevident  in  lower  transportation  costs  and  higher  agricultural \nproduct profit margins.  \n \nImproved roads and better connectivity will allow farmers to more \nreadily market agricultural crops, which in turn will stimulate more \nagricultural  wage  employment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor. \nLower  transportation  costs  will  also  increase  mobility  among  the \npoor  to  find  employment  opportunities  in  other  areas.  Road \nimprovement will facilitate access to schools, medical clinics, and \nemployment centers.  \n \nOther  indirect  benefits  from  improved  regional  trade  and  transit \nwill  be  generation  of  new  employment  opportunities  to  facilitate \nrehabilitation  of  displaced  populations  and  ex-combatants,  inter-\nethnic reconciliation, and improvement of security and stability.   \n \n \n\nlabor,  and  wages  accruing \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nv\n\ninterference  by \n\nApart  from  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs,  the  improved  road \nwill  decrease  the  chances  of  accident  deaths  and  disabilities \nresulting  from  extremely  poor  road  conditions.  Thus,  increased \neconomic activity and easy access to social services are expected \nto  significantly  increase  household  incomes  and  enhance  quality \nof life, thereby reducing overall poverty incidence.  \n \nThe  risks  to  the  Project  are  related  to  (i)  the  overall  political  and \nregional \nsecurity  situation  and  possible \nwarlords/militia leaders, (ii) trafficking of opium along the improved \nroads,  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  weak  implementation  capacity,  (iv) \ntimely  provision  of  counterpart  resources,  and  (v)  the  increased \nspread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  caused  by  improved \nroad connectivity.  \n \nThe  risks  will  be  mitigated  through (i)  continued  close  monitoring \nand  coordination  with  local  and  central  authorities  and  United \nNations agencies to ensure adequate protection, (ii) improvement \nof  border  procedures  to  contain  the  movement  of  opium,  (iii) \nallocation of resources for consulting services to help with project \ntechnical \nmanagement  and \nassistance  to  MPW  through  the  ongoing  technical  assistance \ncluster,  (iv)  use  of  the  existing  MPW  project  management \narrangement \nInfrastructure \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, and (v) development of \nmitigating  measures  by  the  project  component  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-human trafficking awareness campaign.  \n\nimplementation,  and  continued \n\nthe  ongoing  Emergency \n\nfor \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Qaisar-Bala Murghab Road Project. The project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRoad Infrastructure \n\n \nAfghanistan is a landlocked country. With a large area (about 652,000 square kilometers \n2. \n[km2]) and an estimated population of 22.8 million widely spread across the largely mountainous \nterrain, roads are the principal means of transport. Its road network comprises about 6,100 km \nof  national  roads,  15,000  km  of  provincial  roads,  15,000\u201320,000  km  of  rural  roads,  and  about \n3,000 km of urban roads including 1,060 km in Kabul. Of the national roads, 3,300 km comprise \nnational primary roads forming part of the 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major \nregional centers (Herat, Kandahar, Maimana, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and \nthe roads leading to neighboring countries. The remaining 2,800 km of national roads constitute \nsecondary roads with gravel or earthen surface. The 15,000 km provincial roads have gravel or \nearthen surface and comprise 5,400 km of provincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial \nsecondary roads \n \nMuch  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  infrastructure  was  destroyed  or  damaged  during  the  more \n3. \nthan two decades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance and has \nled to major deterioration and loss of infrastructure. A comprehensive needs assessment of the \nAfghanistan  transport  sector 1   by  major  external  funding  agencies  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) revealed that 54%  of national roads were in poor condition, 26% in \nfair condition, and only 20% in good condition. The needs assessment recommended that the \nentire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis. \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road density \n4. \nof  0.03  km/km2  is  far  lower  than  that  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  which  also  have \nlargely  mountainous  terrain  and  similar  population  density,  and  is  even  lower  than  that  of \nBalochistan  in  Pakistan,  where  population  density  is  about  half  that  of  Afghanistan. 2  Even \nwithout  the  damage  inflicted  during  the  conflict  period,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  needs \nsubstantial improvement to provide the Afghan population with a basic level of connectivity.    \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Transport Service \n\n \n5. \nThe number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. Statistics in a \nrecent International Monetary Fund country report3  on Afghanistan show that transport of goods \nby road increased from 1.9 million tons (t) in 2000 to 3.7 million t in 2001 and 5 million t in 2002, \nrepresenting an almost fourfold increase. The number of taxicabs nearly doubled from 17,000 in \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. Afghanistan\u2019s Transport Sector on the Road to Recovery. Manila.  \n2  Road densities are 0.18 km/km2 in Tajikistan, 0.17 km/km2 in the Kyrgyz Republic, and 0.07 km/km2 in \n\nBalochistan Province of Pakistan. \n\n3   International  Monetary  Fund.  2003.  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan:  Rebuilding  a  Macroeconomic  Framework  for \n\nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC: IMF. \n\n\f 2 \n\n2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to be registered in Kabul, \nwhich under certain assumptions would translate into about 304,000 vehicles countrywide. Most \nvehicles  are  owned  and  operated  by  the  private  sector  as  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)-\noperated fleet has been severely depleted.  \n \n6. \nThe  Afghan  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  dominant  role  in  trucking  and  has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears. As expected, long distance public transport linking major cities and neighboring countries \nhas  deteriorated  due  to  road  and  vehicle  conditions  which  have  suppressed  the  demand  for \nroad travel. Security remains a key concern. \n \n7. \nUrban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  provided  mostly  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe  roads  and  the  availability  of  vehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  the \ndistinction  between  passenger  and  commercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate \nprovincial  and  district  routes.  Some  165  registered  long-distance  private  bus  companies  are \nestimated to be operating\u2015101 based in Kabul, 64 in provinces\u2015with a total of 14,007 buses, \nmostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Sector Management \n\n \n8. \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  has  been  responsible  for  developing,  operating, \nand  maintaining  of  the  primary  and  secondary  road  network  in  the  country.  MPW  had  an \ninstitutional  setup  of  a  large  engineering  organization  with  staff  stationed  in  every  major \nprovincial capital and carrying out work through force account. Over the course of the conflict, \nMPW  lost  the  majority  of  its  trained  staff.  The  current  staff  of  2,900  require  substantial  skills \nenhancement  to  perform  their  duties.  The  Ministry  of  Rehabilitation  and  Rural  Development  is \nresponsible  for  developing  of  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads.  Construction  and \nmaintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n9. \nMOT  regulates  the  private  sector  transport  industry.  MOT\u2019s  primary  function  is \ncoordinating  agreements  between  the  private  sector  and  international  transporters  and \nestablishing  eight  offices  in  neighboring  countries  to  facilitate  international  trade.  The  private \nsector department in MOT sets technical standards for private commercial vehicles and inspects \nthem for compliance during licensing and renewal of license. It collects a fee of 5% per carriage \ncontract  from  private  trucks  and  3%  per  trip  from  interprovincial  private  buses,  based  on \nauthorized charge rates.  \n \n10. \n\nAppendix 2 presents an analysis of the road sector in Afghanistan.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy for Road Sector Development  \n\n \nThe  Government  declared  that  rehabilitation  of  the  road  system,  especially  of  national \n11. \nprimary  roads,  is  the  country\u2019s  top  priority  in  reconstruction.  With  external  assistance,  since \n2002 the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish the road network, so as \nto facilitate provision of basic social services to remote provinces, provide security, and involve \nall the population in undertaking nation-building activities. \n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nCurrently,  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  roads  in  Afghanistan  is \n12. \nfinanced  mainly  by  external  assistance.  The  current  commitments  of  external \nbilateral/multilateral funding agencies to Afghanistan\u2019s road sector amount to approximately \n$1  billion,  including  $800  million  for  national  primary  roads,  $130  million  for  national \nsecondary  roads,  and  $30  million  for  provincial  roads.  These  commitments  are  mainly  to \nrehabilitate damaged roads. \n \nFor  improving  the  road  network,  the  Government  has  set  a  target  to  double  the \n13. \nshare of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present 0.15 \nkm  of  paved  road  per  1,000  people  to  0.23  km  per  1,000  in  2010.  To  reach  this  target, \ninvestment needs from 2004 to 2010 will be for $4.3 billion outside the existing commitment: \n$1.7  billion  for  national  primary  roads,  $1.1  billion  for  national  secondary  roads,  and  $1.5 \nbillion for provincial roads.4 Considering the limited prospect for private sector financing of \nthese large investments in the foreseeable future, the public sector and external assistance \nwill continue to be responsible for filling the financing gap. \n \n14. \nAfghanistan  has  a  history  of  toll  collection  for  road  maintenance.  The  first  toll  system \nwas  implemented  in  1974.  Tolls  were  collected  by  way  of  a  system  of  toll  stations  scattered \nthroughout the country, and the revenue accrued to the central revenue fund with no earmarking \nfor the road sector. A new system implemented in 1999 introduced earmarking the toll revenue \nfor  construction  and  maintenance  of  highways.  Through  a  decision  of  the  High  Council  of \nMinisters on 23 September 2002, however, this road toll system was abolished. Approximately \n$80  million  is  estimated  to  be  required  annually  to  maintain  the  entire  road  network.  For  a \ncountry with total domestic revenues of only $300 million, that cost will be a challenge. While the \nGovernment  is  in  the  process  of  establishing  a  fuel  tax  regime  to  support  road  maintenance \nfunding, it is also considering reinstating toll collection on improved road sections5 to cover the \nmaintenance cost as well as to recover part of the capital investment cost. ADB is providing, as \npart  of  the  master  plan  Technical  Assistance  (TA) 6 ,  support  in  formulating  financing \nmechanisms for road sector expenditure. \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n15. \nADB  puts  the  first  priority  to  rehabilitating  of  the  road  system,  critical  for  a  landlocked \ncountry. To rebuild the economy, roads are needed to establish major economic linkages both \ndomestically  as  well  as  with  neighboring  countries.  The  strategic  framework  for  rehabilitating, \nreconstructing, and developing of the road sector consists of the following elements: (i) policies \nand  institutions  developing;  (ii)  building  capacity;  (iii)  developing  the  private  sector;  (iv) \ngenerating  employment;  (v)  encourage  community  participation;  (vi)  decentralizing  of  network \nmanagement; (vii) promoting sustainable sector financing and cost recovery; (viii) protection and \npreserving  the  environment;  (ix)  avoiding  and  mitigating  resettlement;  (x)  absorbing  returnee \nrefugees,  ex-combatants,  and  women \n(xi) involving the community in road construction and maintenance.  \n \n16.  MPW  or  state-owned  enterprises  will  be  assisted  to  gradually  withdraw  from  road \nconstruction  and  maintenance  and \nthe  private  sector, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the local communities.

Developing \nthe capacity of the human resources of road sector institutions is a key requirement to help the \nGovernment fulfill its role. \n \n17. \nIn rehabilitating the road sector, priority attention will be given to a core highway network \nwith emphasis on trade links to neighboring countries, including bridges, repair of disintegrated \npavements,  drainage  erosion  prevention,  and  routine  maintenance.  ADB  assistance  for \nrehabilitating roads will include capacity building and reconstruction of main link roads, bridges, \nand  causeways.  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  road  planning  and  design  will  take  into  account  the \nsubregional  links,  which  will  demand  a  higher  standard  than  would  roads  for  the  use  of \nAfghanistan alone.  \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n \n18. \nThe national primary roads are being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance \nfrom  bilateral  and  multilateral  funding  agencies  (Appendix  3).  Priority  has  been  given  to \nrehabilitating the strategic road connection primarily comprising the ring road and border access \nroad  to  surrounding  countries.  In  this  context,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  and  the  Japanese  Government  provided  support  for  rehabilitating  the \nKabul-Kandahar road. USAID, the Japanese Government, and the Saudi Arabian Government \nprovided financing for rehabilitating Kandahar-Herat road. The World Bank provided support for \nrehabilitating  Kabul-Doshi  road  including  the  repair  of  Salang  tunnel.  ADB\u2019s  Emergency \nInfrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP)7  approved  in  2003  finances \nrehabilitation of the road from Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e Sharif to Andkhoy. ADB\u2019s TA conducted \nthe  feasibility  study  for  the  whole  length  (554  km)  of  Herat-Andkhoy  road,  which  was  the  only \nmissing part of the ring road. ADB\u2019s Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project approved in 2004 provided \nfinancing  to  improve  of  210  km  of  road  from  Andkhoy  to  Qaisar.  The  Project  will  continue  to \nrehabilitate  90  km  of  the  Qaisar-Bala  Murghab  road.  When  the  remaining  180  km  of  Herat-\nAndkhoy  road  is  completed  with  the  Saudi  Arabian  Government\u2019s  pledge  of  $100  million,  the \ncomplete ring road will have been rehabilitated. \n \nAid agencies\u2019 assistance also focused on border access roads. The Iranian Government \n19. \nfinanced the rehabilitation of Herat-Islam Qala road that allows transborder traffic from Iran. The \nEuropean  Commission  provided  support  for  rehabilitating  Kabul-Jalalabad  road,  and  the \nremaining  section  up  to  the  major  border  point  of  Torkham  was  financed  by  the  Pakistan \nGovernment.  ADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  loan 8   approved  in  2002  supported \nrehabilitation of Kandahar-Spin Boldak road that reaches the Pakistan border. The World Bank \nfinances  rehabilitation  of  Pul-e  Khumri-Kunduz-Shirkhan  Bandar  road  that  reaches  the \nTajikistan border. ADB\u2019s EIRRP finances rehabilitation of Naibabad-Hairatan road that reaches \nthe Uzbekistan border. With support from aid agencies, all key border access roads are being \nrehabilitated. \n \n20. \nIn  2004,  ADB  provided  TA  (footnote  6)  for  preparing  a  road  master  plan  for  a  road \ndevelopment  program  for  the  next  5\u201310  years  for  efficient  and  effective  road  rehabilitation \nfocusing on identifying major east-west and north-south corridors to cross-link the ring road.

The next phase in ADB\u2019s assistance for road \nrehabilitation will be based on the road development program of the TA. \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building and Sector Reforms \n\n \n21. \nAs recommended by the comprehensive needs assessment, a team of international and \ndomestic experts is assigned to MPW to compensate for MPW\u2019s lack of capacity to implement \nlarge-scale projects. Under the ongoing TA cluster for capacity building9 ADB is providing such \nassistance to strengthen MPW\u2019s capacity to plan and manage projects.  Under the EIRRP and \nthe  Andkhoy-Qaisar  Road  Project,  the  project  implementation  unit  established  within  MPW  is \ngradually  building  capacity  to  handle  day-to-day  project  implementation  with  the  aid  of  project \nmanagement consultants and by closely coordinating with the Afghanistan Reconstruction and \nDevelopment  Services  (ARDS),  which  was  established \nto  centrally  handle  planning, \ncoordination, preparation, and procurement of major reconstruction projects. Several MPW staff \nhave  been  attached  to  the  contractor  and  the  supervision  consultants  to  receive  on-the-job \ntraining  in  project  administration  and  implementation.  The  Project  will  expand  this  on-the-job \ntraining program by assigning MPW staff to the project management and implementation unit. In \n2005 ADB will provide a stand alone TA for institutional capacity building for road agencies, the \nscope of which will be defined in consultation with other aid agencies and MPW. \n \nThe  Transport  Sector  Review  (TSR) 10  studied  the  policy  objectives  identified  by  the \n22. \nPostconflict  Multisector  Program  loan  (footnote  8)  and  recommended  major  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms.  The  Policy  Statement  for  the  Transport  Sector,  prepared  as  part  of  the \nTSR, sets out the guiding principles of the recommended reforms and provides the framework \nfor reform implementation (Supplementary Appendix A). The TSR on the road sector dealt with \n(i) the organizational structure of MPW; (ii) construction and maintenance operations of MPW; \n(iii)  reform,  restructuring,  and  strengthening  of  MPW;  (iv)  financing  of  the  road  sector;  and  (v) \nlong-term  institutional  arrangements  in  the  road  sector.  The  Government  had  established  a \nsteering  committee  to  provide  guidance  and  review  the  TSR.  In  January  2004  the  steering \ncommittee approved the TSR with all its recommendations, and paved the way for submission \nof the TSR to the cabinet for approval. The cabinet has not formally approved the TSR yet due \nto complicated political conditions in the country. Nonetheless, the recommendations are being \nimplemented in stages. \n \n23. \nADB  and  Japan  are  cochairs  of  the  aid  agencies  consultative  group  in  the  transport \nsector,  and have  led  discussions  on  policy  issues  with  the  aid  agencies  and  the  Government. \nThe  consultative  group  has  established  six  working  groups  comprising  aid  agencies  and  the \nGovernment,  and  focusing  on  (i)  preparing  handover  procedures  for  completed  roads,  (ii) \npreparing road standards, (iii) road maintenance, (iv) revenue generation for road maintenance, \n(v)  capacity  building  in  the  public  transport  sector,  and  (vi)  capacity  building  in  the  private \ntransport  sector.  The  working  groups  meet  regularly  and  have  completed  the  handover \nprocedures and the interim road and highway standards, which have been accepted by MPW. \n \nSector and policy reforms focus on two reform issues: (i) restructuring MPW, and (ii) the \n24. \nrecovering cost of road investment. The restructuring of MPW has been pursued in line with the \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  Cluster  to  Afghanistan  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and \n\nDevelopment. Manila.   \n\n10  The  Transport  Sector  Review  was  prepared  in  2004  with  the  sponsorship  of  the  Swedish  International \n\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency and supported by ADB and the World Bank. \n\n\f 6 \n\nGovernment\u2019s priority reform and restructuring (PRR) 11 scheme. The PRR status requires MPW \nto become more accountable and responsible by preparing job descriptions and staffing clearly \ndefined  positions  through  open  advertisement.  This  requirement  makes  qualified  MPW  staff \neligible for higher salary as an incentive and is intended to weed out staff who are not qualified \nor who require retraining/upgrading. MPW had received PRR status for its capacity building unit \nthat was newly created to take charge of PRR processes and the maintenance department for \nKabul  zone.  Recently,  however,  the  Independent  Administrative  Reforms  and  Civil  Services \nCommission  instructed  MPW  to  seek  PRR  status  for  the  entire  ministry,  rather  than  on  a \ndepartment-by-department basis. Stage 1 subsequently was approved for the entire MPW, and \nthe application for Stage 2 has been submitted. Once stage 2 is approved, MPW will proceed \nwith implementing its restructuring plan, which includes preparing job descriptions, advertising, \nand  recruiting  staff.  A  committee  has  been  established  in  MPW  to  supervise  the  PRR. \nAdditionally, the working group for capacity building in the public transport sector continues its \nwork to coordinate and support MPW in implementing the PRR.  \n \n25. \nFor  cost  recovery,  the  Government  considers  raising  revenue  through  fuel  taxes  and \nthus  help  expedite  partial  self-financing  of  road  construction  and  operation.  At  the  same  time, \nthe  Government  is  also  considering  reinstating  toll  collection  on  improved  road  sections.  ADB \nprovided TA to support the development of a road tolling strategy including tariff structure on the \nKabul-Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  road.  The  revenue  from  road  tolling  would  be  collected  into  a \nsingle  treasury  account  as  per  requirement  of  the  Afghan  constitution.  The  Government  has \nformed a commission, chaired by MOF, to look into issues related to tolling of the major roads \nthat  are  being  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed.  The  members  of  the  commission  include \nrepresentatives  from  MPW,  MOT,  and  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  The  commission  is  considering \nthe modality for tolling, regulations, and tariff, and will submit a report to the cabinet. MPW has \nagreed  to  address  with President  Karzai  the  legislation  needed  to  allow  road  tolling  under  the \nconstitution  of  Afghanistan.  The  United  States  similarly  has  discussed  the  issue  with  the \nPresident, suggesting that a presidential decree might be issued before the 18 September 2005 \nparliamentary elections to allow the collection of road tolls in Afghanistan. ADB has contributed \nto this key toll revenue issue through its ongoing road master plan study.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSubregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n\n \n26. \nThe  efforts  by  Afghanistan  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  its  shattered  road  network \nhave  drawn  the  attention  of  many  of  its  neighboring  countries.  An  improved  road  network  in \nAfghanistan  will  result  in  an  improved  transport  network  in  the  subregion.  Landlocked  Central \nAsian  republics  have  shown  great  interest  in  establishing  transport  corridors  through \nAfghanistan to warm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and the Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly \ndeveloping their ports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased \nimport/export and transit shipment of goods through their ports.  \n \n27. \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport  corridors.  Under  the  TA  cluster  (footnote  9),  ADB  provided  assistance  to  develop  a \n\n                                                 \n11 Priority  reform  and  restructuring  (PRR)  is  an  institutional  reform  scheme  based  on  the  Presidential  Decree  on \nPriority  Reform  and  Restructuring  within  Ministries  and  Government  Agencies  issued  on  12  July  2003,  and  is \nadministered by the Independent Administrative Reforms and Civil Services Commission. The intent of the scheme \nis  to  promote  the  reform  and  restructuring  of  ministries  and  Government  agencies.  Ministries  and  Government \nagencies can apply for PRR status in two stages by submitting preliminary institutional reform plans for stage 1 and \nby  submitting  detailed  action  plans  to  implement  the  reforms  for  stage  2.  Once  they  have  obtained  PRR  status, \nemployees  who  fill  new  posts  under  the  restructured  organization  are  compensated  with  additional  salary  in  the \nform of an interim additional allowance.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nframework and legislation to facilitate cross-border trade. This has evolved into the initiative to \nestablish  the  Central  and  South  Asia  Transport  and  Trade  Forum  (CSATTF). 12  Under  this \ninitiative, meetings have been held to discuss customs harmonization; coordinated development \nof border infrastructure; and enforcement of the laws on drug and human trafficking, and money \nlaundering.13 \n \n28. \nAs for infrastructure improvement, ADB has been financing two key international links in \nAfghanistan: the road from Kandahar to Spin Boldak on the border with Pakistan (footnote 8), \nand  the  road  from  Naibabad  to  Hairatan  on  the  Uzbekistan  border  (footnote  7).  In  Pakistan, \nADB financed the Balochistan Road Development Sector Project14 to rehabilitate and widen the \nKalat-Quetta (130 km) and Quetta-Chamman (117 km) sections of N25 linking Karachi through \nChamman to Afghanistan, and improve the cross-border facility and procedures at Chamman. \nADB  will  also  finance  the  improvement  of  the  road  network  in  North-West  Frontier  Province, \nincluding  the  Peshawar-Torkhan  (46  km)  and  N55-Ghulan  Khan  (118  km)  sections,  and  the \ncross-border  facilities  at  Torkham  and  Ghulan  Khan. 15   In  Central  Asia,  ADB  supports \nsubregional  cooperation  and  removal  of  impediments  to  cross-border  road  transport  through \nregional TAs and road rehabilitation projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n \n\n6. \n\nSecurity Situation \n\n \nSecurity  is  the  main  issue  and  constraint  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  reconstruction.  Without  an \n29. \nadequate  level  of  security,  the  country  will  fail  to  achieve  key  national  goals  for  economic \ngrowth,  political  normalization  and  national  reconciliation,  and  social  development.  In  recent \nyears,  Afghanistan  has  made  significant  gains  in  security  that  has  laid  a  solid  foundation  for \ncontinued and accelerated reform and has avoided a resurgence of major civil conflict. Sporadic \noutbreaks  of  armed  conflict,  even  if  not  always  fully  resolved,  have  been  contained  and \nprevented from spreading. Not all indicators are positive, however. Attacks on aid workers have \nincreased, and expatriate personnel increasingly have become victims of criminal activities. The \nKabul-based International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in cooperation with Afghan security \nforces, has provided some level of security. Some improvements also have been made in the \npolice force \u2015which at the time of the October 2004 election included some 48,000 members\u2015 \nand  the  first  units  of  a  national  army  have  been  formed  and  trained.  Security  on  the  main \nintercity roads has improved significantly.  \n \n30. \nThe  disarmament,  demobilization,  and  reintegration  program  (DDR)  supported  by  the \nUNDP aims at reducing the number and size of Afghan military forces, the officially recognized \nmilitia units in Afghanistan, and to simultaneously undercut the military strength of the regional \ngovernors.  By  February  2005,  about  70%  or  some  38,000  combatants  of  the  officially \nrecognized militia forces had been disarmed, with most of them participating in the reintegration \nprogram.  However,  about  850  unofficial  militias  with  an  excess  of  65,000  members  remain \noutside the scope of this formal DDR process. In the political arena, the Government has made \n                                                 \n12  The  CSATTF  comprises  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan,  with  Iran  as  an \n\nobserver.  \n\n13 A working-level meeting was held in March 2004, and a working group meeting focusing on trade and customs in \nOctober  2004.  A  second  ministerial  conference  was  held  in  March  2005  to  discuss  measures  to  facilitate \nmovement of goods and people in the subregion and endorse new articles on the establishment of the CSATTF.  \n14  ADB.  2003.

In particular, it has strengthened the new Afghanistan \nNational  Army  (ANA),  which  as  of  February  2005  included  some  21,000  soldiers,  a  threefold \nincrease in strength over a year, with support from the United States. If the training proceeds as \nplanned, the target of a 70,000-strong ANA could be achieved by December 2006. \n \n31. \nIn many parts of the country, quasi autonomy  continues to exist under the rule of mid-\nlevel  commanders  and  local  leaders  commanding  the  65,000  strong  unofficial  militias,  armed \nwith non-decommissioned light weapons. The situation enables regional warlords and mid-level \ncommanders  to  maintain  their  military  strength  and  continue  their  influence  over  regional \npolitics.  The  still  weak  control  by  the  Central  Government  contributes  to  somewhat  fragile \nsecurity  in  many  parts  of  the  country.  The  security  situation  will  continue  to  constrain  the \nprogress  of  reconstruction,  and  security  concerns  may  further  discourage  foreign  and  large-\nscale  domestic  investment.  While  attacks  by  Taliban  insurgents  have  decreased,  the  rapid \nincrease  in  opium  poppy  cultivation  and  drug-related  activity  by  local  war  lords  or  drug  lords \nposes  a  grave  threat  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  security  as  well  as  its  further  reconstruction  and \ndevelopment. \n \n32. \nAs  part  of  the  overall  strategy  to  stabilize  the  country,  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty \nOrganization decided in 2003 to expand ISAF beyond the Kabul area.  The 8,000 ISAF troops \nhave contributed to the retrieval of heavy weaponry embedded in the DDR process and expects \nto  achieve  its  target  of  100%  retrieval  by  end-2005.  The  creation  of  provincial  reconstruction \nteams  (PRTs),  teams  of  civilian  and  military  personnel  working  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  provinces  to \nextend  the  authority  of  the  Central  Government  and  to  provide  a  safer  and  more  secure \nenvironment  in  which  reconstruction  can  take  place  also  is  contributing  to  the  stabilization \nprocess in Afghanistan. The PRTs are being expanded to a total of nine province-based teams, \nmainly  in  the  northern  and  western  parts  of  the  country.  The  ISAF-led  PRTs  will  fully  cover \nproject  areas.  In  addition  to  the  ISAF-led  PRTs,  14  additional  PRTs  have  been  established \nunder the mandate of the United States-led coalition forces. \n \n33. \nThe  fragile  security  situation,  however,  may  adversely  affect  the  implementation  of  the \nProject because (i) any security problems in project locations will disrupt and delay construction \nwork; (ii) the supply of raw materials, which will have to be transported through areas controlled \nby  regional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \nconsultants and ADB staff may be constrained. For example, interference from factional leaders \nand the deteriorating security situation have seriously hampered implementation of the project \nto  rehabilitate  the  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  road  financed  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction.  Mobilization  of  machinery  and  plants  experienced  inordinate  delays  due  to  the \nlonger time required for transport across warlord-controlled provinces. Repeated threats to the \nconstruction  workers  and  security  incidents  in  and  around  Kandahar  also  demoralized  the \nemployees of the contractor and consultants.  \n \n34. \nTo  overcome  the  problems,  efforts  to  win  the  support  of  communities  near  the \nconstruction site were made through grassroots outreach. The collaboration of local government \nofficials  and  village  leaders  is  sought.  ADB  is  devising  security  arrangements  under  a  TA16  to \nhelp provide in close cooperation with provincial authorities, a safe work environment for on-site \npersonnel assigned by the contractors and consulting firms. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n7. \n\nOpium-Related Problems \n\n \n35. \nAfghanistan  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of  illicit  opium,  comprising  87%  of  world \nproduction,  or  some  4,200  metric  t.  Narcotics  also  constitute  the  largest  sector  of  the  Afghan \neconomy.  Valued  at  $2.8  billion,  the  opium  economy  equals  some  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  2003 \ngross domestic product ($4.6 billion, if only licit activity is measured). Opium is a major source of \ncash income for farmers because of the high profitability of opium poppy compared with other \nagricultural crops as well as the lack of livelihood alternatives. According to the United Nations \nOffice  on  Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC),  in  2004  poppy  cultivation  in  Afghanistan  hit  an  all-time \nhigh, with 52,400 hectares under cultivation (only 2.9% of total agricultural land). Although this \nrepresented a 64% increase over 2003 cultivation, total production increased by only 17% due \nto  bad  weather  and  crop  disease.  In  2004  opium  poppy  was  grown  in  all  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  34 \nprovinces,  up  from  only  28  provinces  in  2003.  UNODC  estimates  that  356,000  Afghan \nhouseholds  are  involved  in  opium  poppy  cultivation,  representing  some  2.3  million  people,  or \n10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population,  with  each  household  cultivating  an  average  of  0.37 \nhectare (ha) of opium poppy.  \n \n36. \nUNODC\u2019s  February  2005  Rapid  Opium  Poppy  Assessment  Survey  revealed  a  falling \ntrend  in  opium  poppy  cultivation  in  most  provinces,  mainly  because  farmers  refrained  from \nplanting. The main reasons reported by villagers for the expected reduction in cultivation were \nrespect  for  a  Government  ban  on  opium  poppy  cultivation  and  fear  of  eradication.  In  some \nareas, villagers indicated that the low yields of opium poppy in 2004 influenced their decision, as \nwell as increased wheat prices.   \n \nPoppy  cultivation  and  downstream  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major \n37. \nthreat to Afghanistan\u2019s security and stability in that the trade in opium, including opium debt, ties \nthe poor rural population to regional warlords and international crime syndicates. No country can \nestablish  a  sustainable,  accountable  government  and  security  structure  when  nearly  half  its \neconomy is based on the production of an illegal crop. To address the multifactored problem of \nnarcotics  production,  the  Government  in  October  2002  established  a  Counter  Narcotics \nDirectorate to coordinate national policies and programs for drug control, and adopted an Anti-\nNarcotics Law in 2003. The Directorate was elevated to a full ministry in December 2004. Also \nin December 2004 President Hamid Karzai called for a jihad (holy war) on narcotics production, \nresulting in some crop eradication activities. \n \n38. \nThe  Government\u2019s  overall  anti-narcotics  strategy  is  to  eliminate  the  production, \nconsumption,  and  trafficking  of  illicit  drugs  into,  within,  and  from  Afghanistan,  with  focus  on \nproviding  alternative  livelihood  for  Afghan  poppy  farmers,  extending  drug  law  enforcement \nthroughout Afghanistan, implementing drug control legislation, establishing effective institutions, \nand introducing of prevention and treatment programs for addicts. Aid agencies are contributing \nto  the  Government\u2019s  anti-narcotics  efforts  with  focus  on  alternative  livelihoods,  including  rural \ncredit to address the problem of opium debt, as well as support for improved law enforcement \nand interdiction and legal and judicial reform. Aid agencies also are attempting to  mainstream \nthe  anti-narcotics  agenda  into  other  development  activities,  and  recently  have  developed  an \nanti-narcotics  checklist  or  screen  to  promote  such  mainstreaming.  During  the  second  half  of \n2005,  ADB  will  use  this  checklist  to  review  its  activities  in  Afghanistan,  including  its  road  and \ntransport projects.  \n \nAlthough irregular border crossings currently are preferred for illegal trafficking, as formal \n39. \nborder  crossings  improve  and  as  volumes  of  cargo  and  passengers  increase,  the  volume  of \nnarcotics  trafficked  by  way  of  formal  border  crossings  and  through  the  main  roads  is  likely  to \n\n\f 10 \n\nincrease. While the project site (Qaisar- Bala Murghab) is not a main opium-producing region, it \nmay  be  argued  that  improved  transportation  corridors  will  facilitate  trafficking  in  narcotics  and \nhuman  beings.  This  points  to  the  need  for  training  police  and  customs  officers  as  well  as \nimproved interdiction methods, as highlighted by an ADB-commissioned report on cross-border \nlaw enforcement. 17 \n \n40. \nIt  is  noted,  however,  that  the  goal  of  counternarcotics  in  Afghanistan  is  to  building \nstability and the rule of law. Hence the measure of success is not only reducing the amount of \nopium  poppy  grown  by  Afghan  farmers,  but  curtailing  the  flow  of  income  and  accumulation  of \nwealth by traffickers and commanders while maintaining adequate growth in the legal economy. \nIt  is  also  noted  that  opium  cultivation  is  the  only  means  by  which  many  farmers  can  obtain \ncredit,  cash  incomes,  access  to  land,  and,  in  many  cases,  access  to  water  from  tube  wells. \nSimple  crop  eradication  will  only  aggravate  such  problems,  and  current  alternative  livelihood \nactivities will not fully address the needs of poor farmers. This points to the need for a long-term \nand multipronged approach to Afghanistan\u2019s narcotics production and trade.   \n \nADB\u2019s support to the anti-narcotics agenda focuses on helping farm households develop \n41. \nsustainable alternatives to opium poppy cultivation. ADB activities in this regard include creating \nan enabling environment for the commercialization and diversification of agricultural production \nas well as rehabilitating of irrigation systems, which ADB is pursuing through a demand-driven, \nparticipatory, and community-based approach.   \n \n\n8. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy \n\n \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  risks  associated  with  highway  development  vis-\u00e0-vis \n42. \nHIV/AIDS18  transmission  and  human  trafficking.  In  Afghanistan,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Health \n(MOPH) to date has reported 31 HIV cases and 3 deaths. Although the Government has come \nup with a strategic plan,19 there remains a huge funding gap. The World Bank has approved a \n$59.6 million project that will help rebuild the public health system in Afghanistan, with a strong \nemphasis on prevention and education. Although there is no specific HIV/AIDS component due \nto  more  immediate  priorities,  interventions  to  improve  maternal  health  and  prevent  sexually \ntransmitted  infections  will  also  prevent  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.  As  per  MOPH,  provincial \ncapitals have HIV/AIDS testing facility; however, they lack the technical expertise and capacity \nto  carry  out  such  tests  and  currently  the  World  Health  Organization  is  supporting  them  in  this \nregard.  With  assistance  from  the  United  Nations  Population  Fund  (UNPFA)  and  the  United \nNations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  MOPH  has  opened  a  Voluntary  Counselling  and  Testing \nCentre  in  Kabul,  which  would  start  functioning  very  soon.  As  a  first  step,  through  external \nsupport  (UNPFA  and  UNICEF),  MOPH  as  part  of  its  National  HIV/AIDS  Control  Program \ntogether with the Ministry of Religious Affairs had also organized a Religious Leaders National \nConsultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004. During the conference, the role of religious \nleaders in awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS was identified and a future action plan was \nprepared. One of the key concerns of the CSATTF20 has been prevention of human trafficking. \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.  2004.  Cross-Border  Law  Enforcement  for  Drug  Trafficking,  Human  Trafficking,  and  Money  Laundering:    A \n\nRegional Approach for the Afghan Rim. Manila. \n\n18 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n19  According to the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS, the eight priority areas are (i) surveillance, (ii) advocacy and \nmultisectoral response, (iii) reducing risk/harm among vulnerable population, (iv) reducing vulnerability of the youth \nto HIV/AIDS, (v) raising general public awareness, (vi) preventing sexually transmitted infection, (vii) providing safe \nand screened blood, and (viii) voluntary counseling center and training, care, and support. \n\n20 The main objective of the CSATTF is enhanced economic development through promotion of transport and trade. \n\nMembers include Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nOne of the key recommendations has been to develop, fund, and implement training programs \nfor  judicial,  legal,  medical,  and  social  services  and  for  police  and  customs/immigration \npersonnel, to sensitize them to the serious nature of trafficking in persons and the gender-based \nviolence it often entails. Awareness and training programs will enable them to identify situations \nof  trafficking  in  persons  and  to  treat  the  victims  adequately.  It  was  also  proposed  that  the \ntraining programs be carried out together with specialized NGOs, so as to improve cooperation \nbetween NGOs and the authorities. \n \nTo  help  the  Government  combat  the  risks,  a  strategic  guideline  for  HIV/AIDS  and \n43. \nsexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs)  and  anti-human  trafficking  awareness  strategy  has  been \nformulated as part of the Project (Appendix 4).  \n \n\n9. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nimplementation,  administration,  and \n\n \n44. \nA number of lessons can be drawn from past ADB emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, as well as ADB\u2019s initial lending and nonlending operations in Afghanistan since 2002. \nFirst,  continued  emphasis  has  to  be  given  to  capacity  building  to  improve  planning,  project \ndesign  and \nfinancial  management.  Second,  aid \ncoordination  through  government-aid  agency  consultative  groups  or  other  mechanisms  is \nimportant  to  avoid  duplication  or  delays.  Third,  aid  groups  must  work  closely  with  a  country\u2019s \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and central bank to develop a viable and working payment system, \nwithout  which  maintaining  a  flow  of  funds  is  difficult.  Fourth,  capacity  building  in  executing \nagencies is vital, and consulting services for project design and implementation should explicitly \nprovide  for  the  training  of  executing  agency  staff  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated  facilities.  Fifth,  the  number  of  procurement  packages  should  be  minimized,  given \nthe limited implementation capacity for project execution. Sixth, ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines \nshould be applied flexibly to emergency assistance projects to allow for shortened procurement \nperiods  for  the  urgent  delivery  of  project  components.  Seventh,  law-and-order  situations \nresulting from conflict hamper the smooth implementation of projects and detailed security plans \nmust be in place to address possible security hazards in project locations. From experience with \nproject  implementation  in  Afghanistan,  we  can  also  draw  some  lessons  such  as  (i)  advance \nprocurement  action  to  expedite  implementation,  and  (ii)  recruitment  of  consultants  to  be \nexpedited  accordingly.  These  lessons  have  been  fully  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the \nProject. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n45. \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  promote  economic  and  social \ndevelopment and reduce poverty by rehabilitating the primary road network damaged during two \ndecades of conflict and neglect. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in \nthe  country  strategy  and  program  update,  which  includes  a  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure.  \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nRehabilitation of Primary Road Sections \n\n \n46. \nThe Project will finance rehabilitation of the Qaisar-Bala Murghab section (90 km) of the \nHerat-Andkhoy road. The project road is an extension of the Andkhoy-Qaisar road that will be \n\n\f 12 \n\nrehabilitated by ADB\u2019s Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project approved in 2004. The project road will be \nimproved to an asphalt-paved standard that will allow smooth passage of heavy vehicles on two \ntraffic lanes 3.5 meters (m) wide each, two hard shoulders of 1.5 m, and two verges of 0.5 m. To \nreduce  the  construction  cost  in  mountainous  terrain,  the  typical  cross  section  is  reduced  from \n10.0 m to 8.0 m by reducing the width of the shoulders to 0.5 m. The current condition of the \nproject road and proposed design standards are presented in Appendix 5. \n \n47. \nRoad  safety  measures  to  be  incorporated  in  the  construction  design  that  will  include \nsafety barriers to separate pedestrians from vehicles, marker posts to make the road visible at \nnight,  and  signage  to  indicate  road blind  spots, potential  accident-prone  areas,  or  proximity  to \npublic buildings such as schools. In areas where alignments provide little room between house \nstructures and the road, barriers and underground or bridge walkways will be considered.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProvision of Road Tolling Facility \n\n \n48. \nThe Project will also finance the installation of road tolling facilities including toll plazas, \ncomputers  and  communications  equipment,  and  weighing  machines  for  the  project  road.  The \nGovernment  is  now  preparing  road  tolling  implementation  plans  for  the  Kabul-Kandahar-Spin \nBoldak  road.  For  other  roads  to  be  tolled,  tolling  strategy  and  implementation  plans  will  be \ndeveloped under the road sector master plan TA. \n \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign \n\n \n49. \nThe activities under the HIV/AIDS prevention awareness campaign include (i) orientation \nand  sensitization  of  MPW,  MOPH,  religious  leaders,  and  project  personnel  to  HIV/AIDS  and \nSTIs; (ii) raising HIV/AIDS awareness of contractors, construction workers, injecting drug users, \nand  communities  and  villages  along  the  project  road  with  referral  information  and  condom \ndistribution;  (iii)  public  awareness  campaign  for  high-risk  groups  (e.g.,  truck  drivers/helpers, \nidentified  sex  workers,  construction  workers,  injecting  drug  users,  and  vulnerable  groups)  and \nthe  general  public;  (iv)  condom  promotion  and  distribution  at  critical  points  and  during  the \nawareness raising training; and (v) giving out referral information on nearest available services \nfor testing, counseling, and treatment. The awareness generation for the anti-human trafficking \nsubcomponent  will  focus  on  (i)  conveying  behavioral  change  message;  (ii)  providing  safe \nmigration tips, especially to high-risk groups, equipping them with information on police numbers \nand  other  necessary  resources;  (iii)  assisting  local  NGOs  to  coordinate  with  the  police  to \ninvestigate  suspected  transporters  and  human  traffickers;  (iv)  training  police,  customs,  and \nother  relevant  organizations  and  community  in  the  dangers  of  human  trafficking;  (v) \nstrengthening  formal  links  of  the  local  NGOs  with  the  border  police  and  immigration/customs \ndepartment;  (vi)  assisting  the  police  and  immigration/customs  department  to  further  build \ncapacity and strengthen the development of a framework and procedures to identify suspected \nhuman trafficking. Details of cost and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Supervision and Monitoring \n\n \nA consultant team will be hired to help MPW implement the Project. Team members will \n50. \nclosely  coordinate  with  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  established  under  MPW  and  be \nresponsible for (i) overseeing overall project management; (ii) assisting with the procurement of \ncivil  works;  (iii)  supervising  construction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing \ndetailed designs prepared by contractors; (iv) supervising implementation of the HIV/AIDS and \nanti-human trafficking component; (v) certifying completed works by force account as well as by \ncontractors; (vi) providing on-the-job training for MPW staff assigned to the consultant team, and \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nimplementing  and  supervising  the  training  component  of  the  Project;  and  (vii)  undertaking \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n\n5. \n\nIncremental Project Management Support \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n51. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  engagement  of  external  auditors  to  audit  project  accounts \nand  the  payment  of  additional  salary  to  MPW  staff  assigned  to  the  PMU  and  the  consultant \nteam.  \n \nC. \n \n52. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.3  million  equivalent,  including  $304,000  of \ntaxes and duties and physical contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $38.3 \nmillion, representing about 69% of the total cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $17.0 \nmillion equivalent, or about 31% of the total cost. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nD. \n \n53. \nOn  25  August  2004,  the  Board  of  Governors  by  Resolution  No.  300  authorized  ADB, \nunder the Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF), to provide financing in \nthe form of grants (in addition to loans) for projects and programs of high developmental priority. \nSubsequently,  on  21  January  2005,  the  Board  of  Directors  amended  the  Asian  Development \nFund Regulations to provide for the use of the ADF for grant financing in accordance with the \nrequirements of Resolution No. 300. Afghanistan is eligible for ADF grants up to 50% of the total \nADF allocation. \n \n54. \nA  recent  analysis  of  debt  sustainability  by  ADB  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  \nconcluded  that  funding  for  development  projects  should  be  on  a  grant  basis,  or  on  highly \nconcessional terms for key projects and reforms for which no grant funding can be mobilized. In \nview  of  the  extraordinary  challenges  inherent  in  coping  with  the  postconflict  situation, \nAfghanistan  has  requested  enhanced  concessionality  through  grant  financing  of  the  transition \nand  reconstruction  phase.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  project  area  is  the  most  remote  and \npoorest  area  in  a  country  that  requires  highly  concessional  assistance,  the  proposed  ADB \nassistance of $55 million will be provided by grant from ADF resources.   \n \n55. \nThe ADB grant will finance $55 million of the foreign exchange and local currency costs \nof the Project, excluding taxes and duties of $304,000 that will be incurred by the Government. \nThe  waiver  of  cost-sharing  limit  that  has  been  approved  for  loans  and  TA  operations  for \nAfghanistan  is  applied  to  the  Project.21  The  Government  will  make  the  grant  available  to  the \nProject\u2019s Executing Agency through appropriate budgetary allocation.  \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n56. \nMPW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  existing \nPMU, which handles the ongoing Kandahar-Spin Boldak Road Project and the road component \nof  the  EIRRP  (Appendix  7).  The  PMU  will  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project \n\n                                                 \n21  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  Board  resolution  on  the  Extension  of  the  Waiver  for  the  Cost-Sharing  Limits  for \n\nLoans and TA Operations for Afghanistan (28 January 2005).  \n\n\f 14 \n\nimplementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress  reports,  and \n(iv)  maintain  project  accounts  and  complete  loan  financial  records  for  auditing.  The  deputy \nminister  of  MPW  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  management  as  project  director  of \nthe  PMU.  The  current  PMU  includes  three  engineers,  one  accountant,  and  an  office \nadministrator who  will continue to support the Project and be financed under the  Project once \nthe ongoing projects are completed. MPW will also establish a project implementation unit (PIU) \nat  the  site  comprising  two  engineers  and  one  office  administrator  to  liaise  with  the  project \nmanagement consultants, contractors, the local government, and the people in the project area. \nThe PIU staff, stationed in the field, will handle day-to-day project implementation. The PMU will \nbe assisted by consultants engaged under the TA cluster (footnote 6): the project management \nand TA coordination specialist will continue to assist the PMU with overall project management, \nand  the  financial  management  and  auditing  specialist  will  assist  the  PMU  with  financial \nmanagement. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe Project is of an emergency nature and will be implemented over 33 months starting \n57. \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. Using the design-build contract modality will reduce the lead \ntime  required  for  project  preparation.  The  consulting  services  contract  is  expected  to  be \nawarded  and  the  consultant  team  mobilized  by  the  end  of  2005.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be \nawarded by the end of the second quarter of 2006. Civil works will be completed in the second \nquarter of 2008 (Appendix 8). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n58. \nGoods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of  project \nimplementation,  the  Government  requested  flexible  application  of  such  guidelines,  including  a \nshorter  bidding  period  of  60  days  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  A  single-stage \ntwo-envelope  procedure  with  no  separate  prequalification,  which  was  used  in  previous  ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects  in  Afghanistan  on  a  design-build  basis  and  has  proven  effective  in \nreducing the time required for procurement, will be adopted. Equipment for tolling facility will be \nprocured  by  international  shopping.  Indicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  9.  All \ninternational  procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Government  Procurement  Unit  operating \nunder ARDS.  \n \n59. \nThe project area is located in the western part of the country, where ADB nonmember \ncountries,  particularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials, \nespecially bitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude \ncivil works contractors under the Project from seeking the best business terms, and ultimately \nerode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and  economic \nefficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to procure the \nbitumen  required  for  road  pavement  from  all  countries,  including  those  that  are  not  ADB \nmembers. 22   This  special  treatment  was  applied  to  two  previous  transport  projects  in \nAfghanistan,  i.e.,  the  Regional  Airports  Rehabilitation  Project  and  the  Andkhoy-Qaisar  Road \nProject, both approved in 2004. \n\n                                                 \n22  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  agree  to  permit  in  special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n60. \nAll consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB \nfor  recruiting  of  domestic  consultants.  Consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring will be directly awarded to the Getinsa (Spain), given the firm\u2019s excellent work on the \nfeasibility  study  and  preliminary  design  as  well  as  preparation  of  the  bid  documents  for  the \nAndkhoy-Qaisar Road Improvement Project approved in December 2004. The proposed project \nroad passes through the most difficult terrain and remote areas in the Herat-Andkhoy ring road \nsection. Since the project preparatory TA consultants have worked in these areas during the TA \nstage,  they  are  well  set,  logistically,  to  carry  out  the  difficult  tasks  of  design  review  and \nconstruction supervision. They are also familiar with the workings of MPW, and line ministries, \nand  the  difficult  working  environment  in  Afghanistan.  Direct  selection  will  accelerate  the \nmobilization of consultants and save at least 6 months in project start-up. Early mobilization of \nconsultants will (i) facilitate the rapid rehabilitation of this missing link of Afghanistan\u2019s ring road \nand (ii) expedite procurement of civil works packages. The consulting services will require about \n96  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  about  150  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \n61. \nIn view of the high priority accorded to the Project by the Government, and to minimize \nimplementation delays and ensure timely completion of the Project, the Government requested \nADB approval for advance action for procurement of civil works packages including bidding and \nbid evaluation. ADB approved advance action for procurement of ICB civil works contracts. The \nGovernment was informed that the approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. The works related to advance action will be undertaken by the PMU established at \nMPW.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nGrant funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n62. \nAn  imprest  account  primarily  for  incremental  expenditures  related  to  project  management \nsupport for MPW will be established under MOF, with a designated treasurer. The designated \ntreasurer  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  to  which  ADB\u2019s  grant \nproceeds will be transferred and against which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The initial \namount to be deposited into the imprest account will be estimated expenditures for 6 months or \n10%  of  the  loan  amount  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be \nused for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual \npayment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nMPW  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with \n63. \nsound accounting principles, adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the loan \nproceeds, financing resources, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. \nThe  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance \nwith sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports \n\n\f 16 \n\nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than 9 months23 after the end \nof the fiscal year. The annual audits will include an audit of the imprest account and statement \nof  expenditure  records,  and  a  separate  opinion  on  the  audit.  The  unaudited  project  accounts \nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year. The Government will assist ADB representatives to carry out spot and random \nchecks on the flow of funds and their use for the Project and on work in progress.  \n \n64. \nMPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  performance  monitoring,  issues \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n65. \nMPW will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PMU will establish a system \nfor preparing quarterly reports, for performance monitoring and issues resolution, plus periodic \naction plans. Aided by the PMU,  MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \naccrued project benefits. With the help of the project management consultants and no later than \n3 months after loan effectiveness, the MOT will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve the system. ADB and the Government \nwill agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during project implementation and for \n3 months after project completion. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n66. \nADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nThe  project  schedule  calls  for,  a  midterm  review  about  18  months  after  the  Project  starts, \naround  March  2007.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  detailed  progress  report  on \nimplementation  and  achievements  prior  to  the  midterm  review.  Terms  of  reference  for  the \nmidterm  review  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration  memorandum  to  be  prepared  by \nADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n67. \nIn Afghanistan, approximately 53% of the population live on less than $1 a day and are \nclassified  as  poor24.  The  prolonged  war  in  the  country  further  exacerbated  by  drought  in  the \nproject area has severely affected the means of livelihood of the local population. The sample \nhousehold survey and consultations revealed that almost 90% of the households were engaged \nin  subsistence  agriculture  and  allied  activities  for  their  livelihood,  while  the  rest  had  small \nbusinesses  in  the  towns.  The  households  in  the  project  area  are  extremely  poor,  with  an \naverage monthly income of approximately AF2,000 and average household size of 5.5 persons. \nDeclining farm productivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for agricultural labor are among of \nthe  main  determinants  of  poverty  in  the  area.  Lack  of  primary  health  care  and  education \nfacilities is also among the major problems. The present state of infrastructure, especially roads, \n\n                                                 \n23 The  weak  capacity  of  MPW  to  maintain  project  accounts  and  prepare  financial  statements  necessitates  a  longer \n\nperiod for submission of audited project accounts.  \n\n24  ADB.

The  direct \npoverty  impact  will  be  on  income  generation  and  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages \naccruing to laborers during construction of the project road. Other benefits will result from lower \ntransportation  costs  and  higher  agricultural  product  profit  margins.  Improved  roads  and  better \nconnectivity will encourage farmers to grow larger marketable surpluses that, in turn, will provide \nthe  poor.  Lower \nfor  expanded  agricultural  wage  employment,  particularly  benefiting \ntransportation  costs  will  also  increase  mobility  that  will  enable  the  poor  to  seek  employment \nopportunities  in  other  areas.  Road  improvement  will  facilitate  more  ready  access  to  schools, \nmedical clinics, and employment centers. Improved regional transit and trade, another indirect \nthe \nbenefit,  similarly  will  generate  new  employment  opportunities, \nrehabilitation  of  displaced  populations  and  ex-combatants,  interethnic  reconciliation,  and \nimprovement  of  security  and  stability.  In  addition  to  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs,  the \nimproved road will reduce accidental deaths and disabilities resulting from extremely poor road \nconditions. Thus, increased economic activity and easy access to social services are expected \nto  significantly  increase  household  incomes  and  enhance  the  quality  of  life,  thereby  reducing \noverall poverty incidence.25 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n10. \n \nB. \n \n69. \nOverall, the Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not significant. Most \nof the improvement works will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way and so agricultural \nland acquisition will be minimal (0.08 ha). Acquisition of only small amounts of privately owned \ncommercial  (0.06  ha)  and  residential  (0.02  ha)  land  will  be  required.  In  total,  130  households \n(650 affected people) will suffer resettlement impacts as a result of the Project. Four households \nwill be affected by agricultural land acquisition and will lose 1% of their productive assets. None \nof  the  2  residential  and  121  commercial  structures  owned  by  the  titleholders  will  be  displaced \nand  none  will  require  any  relocation.  Three  commercial  squatter  households  whose  structures \nwill  be  totally  affected  will  be  relocated  or  pushed  back  to  the  adjacent  available  government \nland.  The  residential  structures  will  lose  a  very  small  portion  of  their  homestead  land  and \nearthen  boundary  walls.  The  commercial  structures  will  lose  a  very  small  portion  of  their \ncommercial  land  and  permanent  or  temporary  extensions  or  shades  of  their  shops. Land  take \nand  impact  on  commercial  areas  in  towns  could  be  further  minimized  or  completely  avoided \nduring detailed engineering design if the design stipulation of 0.5 m verge on each side of the \nroad  is  compromised  in  the  built-up  areas  of  Gormach  and  Chilgasi.  The  affected  households \nwill receive cash for land and assets at replacement prices. Compensation will be provided for \nloss  of  income  for  temporary  disruption  caused  during  construction,  shifting  assistance  and \nadditional assistance to vulnerable groups. No indigenous people will be affected by the Project. \nThe  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  approximately  AF2,800,000 \n($60,000).  A  short  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  will  be  translated  into  Dari \nand disclosed to the affected persons. The plan will also be publicly available at MPW, ADB\u2018s \nAfghanistan Resident Mission, and on the ADB web site. \n \n\n                                                 \n25  The  findings  are  consistent  with  empirical  evidence  identified  by  ADB\u2019s  regional  TA  5947  (ADB.  2001.  Technical \n\nAssistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila). \n\n\f 18 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nC. \n \n70. \nEconomic  analysis  (Appendix  11)  was  conducted  for  the  entire  stretch  of  the  Herat-\nAndkhoy road in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The \nhighway design and maintenance model (HDM-III) was used to calculate vehicle operating costs \nand time costs, with modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs include vehicle \ncharacteristics and related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The major benefits \nare derived from savings of vehicle operating costs and travel time due to the rehabilitation of \nthe project road, which will provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project area. The time \nrequired  for  traveling  from  Qaisar  to  Bala  Murghab  is  currently  about  8-10  hours.  The  Project \nwill  reduce  that  time  to  1.5\u20132.0  hours.  The  travel  time  on  the  entire  Herat-Andkhoy  road  is \ncurrently more than 24 hours, and average travel speed is slightly more than 20 km/hour. With \nthe  planned  improvement  to  other  sections  of  the  Herat-Andkhoy  road,  the  Project  will \nsignificantly reduce travel time and cost, turning the painful road trip along that road into a safe \nsingle-day daylight trip. \n \nThe  current  traffic  level  is  low  because  of  the  very  poor  condition  of  the  road  and  the \n71. \noverall reduced economic activity due to many years of war and the recent severe drought. With \na strong economic recovery anticipated in the short term, a high level of generated and induced \ntraffic  is  expected.  Considering  this  development  prospect,  the  generated  and  induced  traffic \nwas estimated in absolute numbers, assuming expected growth of outputs and activities and trip \nrates that will be realized 3 years after the project road becomes operational. \n \n72. \nEconomic  evaluation  resulted  in  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18.8%  for  the \noverall  project  road.  The  project  road  was  evaluated  up  to  and  including  2028,  for  a  benefit \nperiod of 20 years; a residual value of 10% was applied in 2028. The Project\u2019s economic costs \ninclude the resource costs for traded and nontraded materials and labor. All cost elements are \nvalued  at  border  prices,  using  a  world  price  numeraire,  with  all  taxes  and  duties  excluded.  A \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  applied  to  the  financial  costs  of  nontraded  inputs  to \ncalculate  economic  prices.  The  traffic  estimate  is  still  conservative,  as  it  does  not  include \ninternational  transit  traffic  from  the  three  neighboring  countries  (Iran,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan) adjacent to Afghanistan\u2019s northwest region.  \n \nD. \n \n73. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  in  category  B  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003).  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  as  part  of  the \nfeasibility study for the Herat\u2013Andkhoy road project. The IEE report was approved by MPW on \n11 August 2004.  \n \nThe IEE found that most of the environmental impacts associated with the Project would \n74. \noccur only during the construction period. Therefore the impacts are temporary and almost all \nthe  mitigating  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  contract  document.  The  contractor  will  be \nbound by the agreement to strictly implement the proposed mitigating measures. The IEE states \nthat no further environmental assessment study is required because the environmental impacts \nare  temporary  and  insignificant.  MPW  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  overall \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management  plan.  The  annual  report  on  implementing  this \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  other  relevant  Government \nagencies, if necessary. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n\f19\n\n \n\nE. \n \n75. \n \n\nRisks \n\n(i) \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n\nleaders  retain \n\nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile.  ADB  will  need  to \nclosely monitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe United Nations to ensure adequate protection.26 ADB\u2019s TA for the security of \nADB-financed  projects  in  Afghanistan  (footnote  11)  will  give  advice  on  how  to \nensure  a  safe  work  environment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the \ncontractors,  subcontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  Under  prevailing  conditions, \nhowever, this security risk cannot be mitigated completely, and delays in project \nimplementation,  if  security  hazards  occur  in  project  locations,  will  be  inevitable \ndespite measures to control the risk. \nRegional  warlords  and  militia \ntheir  military  strength  and \nconsequent  influence  in  regional  politics.  Such  political  instability  could  hamper \nthe  smooth  supply  of  raw  materials  and  equipment  transported  through  areas \nthey  control,  and  might  also  constrain  supervision  of  construction  works  by  the \nconsultants and ADB staff.   \nImproved roads can be used as a route to transport opium. The Government will \nimprove,  as  part  of  the national  counternarcotics  strategy, border  procedures  to \ncontain the trafficking of narcotics. However, the trafficking of narcotics cannot be \ncompletely contained unless the cultivation of opium poppy is eradicated.  \nThe  risks  of  road  connectivity  improvements  contributing  to  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  are  addressed  by  the  Project\u2019s  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-human trafficking component.  \nBecause  Government \nvery  weak, \nimplementation of key activities may be delayed. Also the lack of accounting and \nauditing  capacity  risks  corrupt  practices.  Resources  will  be  allocated  for \nconsulting  services  to  help  with  project  management  and  implementation. \nAdditional  capacity-building  initiatives  focused  on  financial  management  have \nbeen provided under the TA cluster (footnote 6). The Government will establish a \nstrong  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanism.  ADB  will  also  field  review \nmissions as frequently as necessary. \nThe  Government  might  have  difficulty  in  meeting  in  a  timely  manner  its  project \ncost  obligations  such  as  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  counterpart \nfunding.  ADB  will  work  closely  with  MPW  to  address  this  issue  by  examining \nmitigating measures to enhance road sector and government revenues. \n\nimplementation \n\ncapacity \n\nremains \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n76. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\nSecurity. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security \nfor  the  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment will ensure that all civil works contracts will require the preparation \nof  an  action  plan  for  adequate  security  and  smooth  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project; that the cost of implementing such a plan will be \n\n                                                 \n26  Coordination  with  the  provincial  reconstruction  teams  providing  security  for  development  activities  in  the  project \n\narea will also be explored.  \n\n\f 20 \n\n(ii) \n\nincluded  in  the  budget  for  such  civil  works;  and  that  such  a  plan  is  fully \nimplemented. \nDrug  trafficking.  The  Government  will  undertake  concrete  measures  to  detect \nand  prevent  opium  smuggling  by  land  transport,  including  improved  border \nprocedures. \n\n(iii)  Road  maintenance  financing.  The  Government  will  allocate  and  make \navailable, in a timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year \nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities,  and  will  ensure  that \nsuch facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with sound practices. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  implementation  of  a  toll  collection  system  on \nimproved  roads  for  their  maintenance.  To  do  this,  the  Government  will  adopt \nadequate procedures to promote transparency and accountability in collecting the \nproceeds from the toll collection system and other means of revenue generation, \nand  will  install  proper  procedures  including  spot  audits  to  detect  any  abuse  in \ncollecting and using the proceeds. \n\n(iv)  Road  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  are \nincorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project  and  that  public  awareness  campaigns \nrelated to such measures are conducted on a periodic basis.  \nSpot  audits.  The  Government  will  allow  and  assist  ADB's  representatives  to \ncarry  out  spot  and  random  checks  on  (a)  flow  of  funds  and  their  use  for  the \nProject, and (b) work in progress. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  Anticorruption.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or \nmanagerial impropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government and each \nof  its  relevant  agencies  will  fully  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  investigations. \nThe Government will also ensure that (a) upon approval by ADB of the award of \nthe  procurement  contract  package,  the  Government  will  publish  in  the  dailies \ncirculated nationally, both in English and the local language, the bidder with the \nlowest evaluated substantially responsive bid and the agreed upon contract price, \ntogether with the names of other bidders considered; and (b) the Government will \nappoint within 3 months of grant effectiveness, a dedicated staff from the agency \nthat  deals  with  anti-corruption  efforts  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  ADB-\nfunded projects under MPW in accordance with the mandate of this agency. \n(vii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that land and \nrights-of-way  will  be  acquired  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Government  will  also \nensure  that the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  (a)  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  (b) \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  (c)  the  agreed-upon \nthat  payment  of \nresettlement  plan.  The  Government  will  also  ensure \ncompensation and other entitlements to the affected persons will be made prior \nto their relocation and the award of the civil works contract. \n\n(viii)  Updating,  disclosure,  and  monitoring  of  short  resettlement  plan.  The \nGovernment  will,  prior  to  the  commencement  of  construction,  (a)  prepare  an \nupdated  resettlement  plan  based  on  a  final  detailed  design,  which  is  subject  to \nADB approval and (b) cause MPW to disclose the updated resettlement plan and \nensure  that  the  information  will  be  available  to  all  affected  persons  by  posting \nsuch  information  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site.  The  Government  will  also  cause  MPW  to   \n(a)  submit  the  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  (b)  recruit  NGOs  to  facilitate  timely  and  effective  implementation \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nthe \n\n(2002), \n\nIEE,  and \n\nand  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  (c)  establish  grievance  redress \ncommittees at the district level to address environmental, resettlement, and other \nsocial  issues  promptly.  In  accordance  with  the  updated  resettlement  plan,  the \ngrievance  redress  committees  will  be  formed  with  the  task  of  resolving  land \nacquisition and resettlement disputes. In the event that any adverse impacts on \nindigenous people are identified during project implementation, the Government \nwill prepare an indigenous peoples development plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous People (1998). \nEnvironmental  protection.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  preparation, \ndesign, construction, implementation, and operation of the Project will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nthe \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan.  For  this  purpose  the  Government  will  make  an \nadequate  budget  available,  and  ensure  that  all  mitigating  and  monitoring \nmeasures  set  out  in  the  IEE  and  the  environment  monitoring  plan  are \nincorporated  in  the  project  design,  including  a  detailed  design  of  the  project \nfacilities,  and  implemented  during  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance \nthereof.  \nLocal  consultation  and  gender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  specific \nplan  for  local  consultation  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  issues  during \nproject \nthe  bidding  documents.  The \nincluded \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  men  and  women  are  given  equal  employment \nopportunities,  without  any  difference  in  wages  for  equal  work  by  the  civil  works \ncontractors.  The  mechanisms  for  maximizing  local  employment  benefits  will  be \nincluded in the project design and the bidding documents.  \nLabor, health risks and provisions. MPW will ensure that civil works contracts \nincorporate  provisions  requiring  contractors  to  (a)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs \nawareness  and  prevention  programs  for  labor;  (b)  disseminate  information  at \nwork sites and in the overall project area on risks of STIs and HIV/AIDS as part of \nhealth  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during  construction;  (c)  not \nemploy  children  for  construction  and  maintenance  works;  and  (d)  follow  and \nimplement  legally  mandated  provisions  on  labor  (including  equal  pay  for  equal \nwork), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions; (e) eliminate all forms of \nforced or compulsory labor; and (f) allow freedom of association and the right of \ncollective bargaining.  \nImplementation  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-human \ntrafficking \ncomponent. MPW will ensure that MOPH deputes an official to the PMU to carry \nout  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-human  trafficking  component  as  agreed \nupon with ADB. MPW through MOPH support will engage qualified locally based \nNGOs  to  implement  the  component.  MPW,  through  its  PMUs  and  with  the \nsupport of MOPH, will supervise and monitor the activities of the NGOs. \n\nimplementation  will  be \n\nin \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  The PIU. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that \nthe  additionally  required  PIU  staff,  comprising  two  engineers  and  other  office \nadministration staff, will have been appointed. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n77. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  grant  of  $55,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Qaisar-Bala \n\n\f 22 \n\nMurghab  Road  Project  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n78. \nI also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set out in para. 59 of this Report \nthat bitumen procured from nonmember countries of ADB for civil works be eligible for financing \nunder  the  Project.  If  the  requisite  affirmative  vote  of  Directors  representing  not  less  than  two \nthirds of the total voting power of ADB's members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement \nestablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  is  not  obtained  for  this  recommendation  and  the \nBoard approves only the recommendation in para. 77, then bitumen for civil works procured only \nfrom member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing under the Project. \n \n \n \n\nJoseph Eichenberger \nVice-President (Operations 2) \n\n \n\n \n \n21 June 2005 \n\n\f \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING

Network \n\nA.  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s road network comprises about 6,100 kilometers (km) of national roads and \n1. \n15,000 km of provincial roads. Of the national roads, 3,300 km comprise national primary roads \nincluding 2,400 km that had been originally paved. The national primary road network consists \nlargely  of  the  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects  Afghanistan\u2019s  major  regional  centers  (Herat, \nKandahar,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Maimana,  and  Sheberghan)  with  Kabul,  and  the  roads  leading  to \nneighboring  countries  including  Iran,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The \nremaining 2,800 km of national roads constitute secondary roads with either gravel or earthen \nsurface. Provincial roads of 15,000 km have of gravel or earthen surface, and are categorized \ninto provincial primary roads (5,400 km) and provincial secondary roads (9,600 km). The tertiary \nroad  network  consists  of  rural  roads  that  are  roughly  estimated  to  be  15,000\u201320,000  km,  and \nsubstantial  lengths  of  urban  roads  roughly  estimated  to  be  3,000  km  including  1,060  km  in \nKabul. \n \n2. \nMost  of  the  national  primary  road  network  was  improved  to  paved  standard  before  the \nconflict,  mainly  with  external  assistance.  The  ring  road  section  from  the  border  of  Jawzjan-\nFaryab Province to Herat (575 km) was left unpaved due to the outbreak of civil conflict.  \n \n3. \nMuch of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged in more than two \ndecades  of  conflict.  Lack  of  resources  and  capacity  prevented  maintenance,  and  has  led  to \nmajor  deterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  The  effects  of  military  actions  are  more \npronounced in the form of damaged bridges and tunnels, which have become bottlenecks to the \nmovement  of  people  and  goods.  Restricted  movement  aggravates  the  country\u2019s  division  and \ndisintegration, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads have significantly increased.1 \n  \nAccording to the comprehensive needs assessment on the Afghanistan transport sector, \n4. \ncarried  out  during  March\u2013May  2002  by  major  external  funding  agencies  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), 54% of the national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, \nand only 20% in good condition. It urged that the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on \na priority basis.2 \n \n5. \nAfghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density (Table A2.1). The \nroad density of 0.03 km per square km (km2) is far lower than that of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan,  which  also  have  largely  mountainous  terrain  and  similar  population  densities.  It  is \neven  lower  than  the  0.07  km/km2  road  density  of  Balochistan  in  Pakistan,  whose  population \ndensity  is  about  half  of  Afghanistan\u2019s.  Even  without  the  damage  inflicted  during  the  conflict \nperiod,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  is  in  need  of  substantial  improvement  (Table  A2.2)  to \nprovide basic connectivity that is available elsewhere in the subregion.   \n\n                                                 \n1   Travel  from  Kabul  to  Kandahar  (1,066  km)  used  to  take  less  than  12  hours  before  the  conflict.  Soon  after  the \n\nconflict, it took about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n\n2   A preliminary needs assessment conducted in December 2001 by ADB, United Nations Development Programme, \nand  World  Bank,  was  presented  at  the  ministerial  meeting  in  Tokyo  in  January  2002,  where  external  funding \nagencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance.   \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nCountry \n\nAfghanistan  \nAzerbaijan \nBangladesh \nIndia \nIndonesia \nKyrgyz Republic \nNepal \nPakistan \nSri Lanka \nTajikistan \nTurkmenistan \nUzbekistan \n\nTable A2.1: Comparison of Key Road Subsector Indicators \nRoad Density  \nin 2000 \n(km/square km) \n0.032 \n0.287 \n1.441 \n1.010 \n0.180 \n0.170 \n0.090 \n0.320 \n1.465 \n0.194 \n0.049 \n0.183 \n\n \nPercent of Road \nPaved \n16 \n92 \n9 \n46 \n47 \n40 \n31 \n43 \n95 \n83 \n81 \n87 \n\nGNP per Capita \nin 2002 \n($) \n186 \n710 \n360 \n480 \n710 \n290 \n230 \n410 \n840 \n180 \n        1,200 \n450 \n\nMotor Vehicles \nper 1,000 People  \nin 2000 \n14 \n49 \n1 \n8 \n25 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n8 \n34 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 = not available, GNP = gross national product, km = kilometer. \nSources: World Bank. 2002.

According to \n6. \nstatistics  provided  in  a  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  country  report  on  Afghanistan,3 \ntransport of goods by road increased from 1.9 million tons (t) in 2000 to 3.7 million t in 2001 and \n5  million  t  in  2002,  representing  an  almost  fourfold  increase.  The  number  of  taxicabs  nearly \ndoubled from 17,000 in 2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles are estimated to be \nregistered  in  Kabul,  which  under  certain  assumptions  would  translate  into  about  304,000 \nvehicles countrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)-operated  fleet has  been  severely  depleted.  According \n7. \nto the Central Statistical Office, in 2002 the Government owned and operated 22,459 vehicles \nconsisting of 10,913 trucks (MOT: 210), 2,741 buses (MOT Millie buses: 230), and 8,162 cars, \nbut nearly all these vehicles are gone. According to the Transport Sector Review, the centrally \nowned  bus  and  lorry  companies  and  also  the  trolley  bus  service  have  practically  collapsed. \nMOT  now  has  some  of the  Kamaz  freight  agencies  and  the  Millie  bus  agency.  MOT  retains a \ntrolley  bus  department,  but  no  vehicles,  workshops,  or  power  supply  network,  which  have  all \nbeen destroyed. \n \n8. \nThe  Afghan  private  sector  including  individuals  and  firms  that  relocated  in  Pakistan \nduring the war years has historically played a dominant role in trucking and has maintained its \npresence.  As  expected,  long  distance  public  transport  linking  major  cities  and  neighboring \ncountries  has  deteriorated  due  to  road  and  vehicle  conditions  as  well  as  the  suppressed \ndemand  for  road  travel.  Security  remains  a  key  concern.  Urban  transport  is  available  on  a \nlimited scale in Kabul and provincial capitals. \n \nUrban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \n9. \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe  roads  and  the  availability  of  vehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  the \ndistinction  between  passenger  and  commercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate \nprovincial  and  district  routes.  Some  165  registered  long-distance  private  bus  companies  are \nestimated  to  be  operating\u2014101  based  in  Kabul,  64  in  the  provinces\u2014with  a  total  of  14,007 \nbuses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n10. \nThe taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \n                                                 \n3   International  Monetary  Fund.  2003.

Washington, DC: IMF. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Administration \n\nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis  seem  to  operate  freely,  with  little  adherence  to  zonal  or  any  other  rules.  In  addition, \nintermediate- size vehicles of all sizes and shapes also transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.  \n \n11. \nRoad administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply.  All  aspects  of  planning,  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  were  carried  out  in-\nhouse  through  a  number  of  MPW  construction  units.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s \ndepartments,  Road  Construction  and  Development,  had  more  than  5,000  employees.  In \naddition, MPW had a multitude of other responsibilities such as city planning and collection of \nroad  tolls.  Theoretically,  MPW  retains  all  these  responsibilities.  The  Ministry  of  Rehabilitation \nand Rural Development is responsible for developing rural infrastructure, including rural roads. \nConstruction and maintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n12. \nOver the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not under the full control of the ministry headquarters in Kabul. \nThe  situation  is  gradually  being  realigned  as  the  central  Government  successfully  extends  its \ncontrol  outside  Kabul  to  the  provinces.  The  current  staffing  level  of  MPW  is  about  2,900,  of \nwhom  900  are  employed  on  a  permanent  basis,  1,900  are  paid  daily  wages,  and  140  are \nmilitary officers. Most of the current staff require substantial skills enhancement to perform their \nduties. \n \n13. \nTo  fill  the  capacity  gap,  most  of  the  externally  funded  projects  are  being  implemented \nwith  the  assistance  of  international  consultants  in  project  management.  Civil  works  are \npackaged  into  large  contracts  and  bid  out  through  competitive  procedures  to  private  sector \ncontractors.  Consultants  engaged  by  MPW  supervise  the  works  of  contractors.  MPW  is  being \ntransformed  into  a  lean  and  thin  organization  with  its  primary  task  being  nationwide  policy \nformation, planning the countrywide road network, setting standards (including technical, safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction (Figure A2).  \n \n\n \nFigure A2: Current Organizational Structure of the Ministry of Public Works \n \n\n \n \n \n\nMinister \n\nDeputy Minister \n\nDirectorate \nof Railways \n\nDirectorate \nof Planning \n\nDirectorate of \nAdministration \n\nDirectorate of \nRoad \nMaintenance\n\nDirectorate of \nRoad Construction \nand Airports\n\nDirectorate of \nSurvey and \nProject Design \n\nDirectorate of \nFinancial \nAdministration\n\nDirectorate of \nAudit and \nController\n\nDirectorate of \nTechnical/ \nMechanical \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nD.  \n \n14. \nCurrently,  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  roads  in  Afghanistan  is \nmainly  financed  by  external  assistance.  The  current  commitments  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  road \nsubsector  by  the  external  bilateral/multilateral  funding  agencies  amount  to  approximately  $1 \nbillion,  including  $800  million  for  national  primary  roads,  $130  million  for  national  secondary \nroads,  and  $30  million  for  provincial  roads.  These  commitments  are  mainly  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged roads.  \n \n15. \nFor the improvement of the road network, the Government has set a target to double the \nshare of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present 0.15 km \nof  paved  roads  per  1,000  people  to  0.23  km  per  1,000  in  2010.  To  reach  this  target,  the  new \ninvestment  needs  from  2004  to  2010  will  be  for  $4.3  billion  outside  the  existing  commitment: \n$1.7 billion for national primary roads, $1.1 billion for national secondary roads, and $1.5 billion \nfor provincial roads.4 Considering the limited prospect for private sector financing of these large \ninvestments in the foreseeable future, the public sector will continue to be responsible for filling \nthe financing gap.  \n \n16. \nAfghanistan  has  a  history  of  toll  collection  for  road  maintenance.  The  first  toll  system \nwas  implemented  in  1974.  Tolls  were  collected  by  way  of  a  system  of  toll  stations  scattered \nthroughout the country, and the revenue accrued to the central revenue fund with no earmarking \nfor the road subsector. The allocations to the road subsector were by way of appropriations from \nthe central revenue fund. A new system implemented in 1999 introduced earmarking the funds \nfor construction and maintenance of highways. MPW organized toll collection and the tolls were \nviewed as a source of MPW revenue. Through a decision by the High Council of Ministers on 23 \nSeptember  2002,  this  road  toll  system  was  abolished.  Private  parties  had  established \nunauthorized  toll  collection  stations  in  a  number  of  locations,  which  created  hardships  for \ntravelers without contributing to the maintenance program.  \n \n17. \nAt  present,  fuel,  spares,  or  vehicles  are  not  taxed,  except  for  customs  duties.  Some \nfees/levies  are  charged  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior  and  the  Provincial  Finance  Department  for \nvehicle registration and renewal.  \n \n18. \nThe Government is in the process of establishing a tax regime. A few more years may \nbe required to fully implement the new tax regime. In the meantime, imposing tolls, in particular \non roads that have recently been rehabilitated, is viewed as an effective way to generate much-\nneeded  revenue  for  road-related  expenditure.  Approximately  $80  million  is  estimated  to  be \nrequired annually to maintain the entire road network. For a country with domestic revenues of \n$300  million,  this  will  be  a  challenge.  The  Government  is  currently  considering  reinstating  toll \ncollection on improved road sections5 to cover the maintenance cost as well as to recover part \nof the capital investment cost.  \n \nE.  \n \n19. \nAs the rehabilitation and reconstruction work progresses, new assets are being created, \nadding  to  the  already  high  demand  for  road  maintenance  activities.  Under  the  ongoing  civil \nservices  reform,  MPW  has  taken  positive  steps  toward  institutional  reform  by  nominating  its \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n                                                 \n4  Government  of  Afghanistan.  2004.

The  former \narrangement  will  be  combined  with  toll  collection.  ADB  has  been  actively  supporting  the \nGovernment in developing a road tolling and maintenance strategy for primary roads.  \n\n                                                 \n6  Priority  reform  and  restructuring  is  an  institutional  reform  scheme  based  on  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Priority \nReform and Restructuring within Ministries and Government Agencies issued on 12 July 2003, and is administered \nby the Independent Administrative Reforms and Civil Services Commission.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\nAgency \n\nDuration \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\n \n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \n\n \n\nProject \n\n \n1.

The  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO) reports that there is no reliable data on HIV/AIDS infection rates within Afghanistan. The \nMinistry  of  Public  Health  (MOPH)  has  reported  31  cases  of  HIV/AIDS  and  3  deaths,  but  it  is \nfeared  that  so  many  more  cases  out  of  the  country\u2019s  22  million  population  go  undetected  and \nunreported.  Of  the  cases  reported  and  suspected  unreported  ones,  a  high  percentage  of \nHIV/AIDS  spread  is  supposed  to  have  occurred  through  unprotected  homo-  and  hetero-\nsexuality,  blood  donations  for  money  during  the  Taliban  regime,  and  unscreened  blood \ntransfusions.  As  women  were  discouraged  from  leaving  the  home  during  the  Taliban  regime, \nHIV/AIDS  infection  among  the  Afghan  female  population  from  their  husbands  and  family \nmembers,  and  among  younger  children,  is  unknown.  However,  it  is  suspected  that  during  the \nTaliban  regime,  poverty  must  have  prompted  male  relatives  to  donate  blood  and  most  likely \ncaused  HIV/AIDS  to  be  more  prevalent.  Information  from  the  Integrated  Regional  Information \nNetworks (IRIN) of the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) indicates \na  high  risk  of  HIV  infection  from  persons  coming  from  other  HIV  affected  countries,  including \nAfghan  returnees,  expatriates,  military  personnel  (international  security  assistance  force, \nCoalition, etc.). However, it is impossible to test and detect HIV cases, considering the absence \nof testing facilities.   \n \nFollowing  discussions  with  MOPH,  it  is  understood  that  all  provincial  capitals  have \n3. \nHIV/AIDS testing facility; however, they lack the technical expertise and the capacity to carry out \ntesting. With assistance from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), MOPH has opened a Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre in \nKabul,  which  will  start  functioning  very  soon.  As  a  first  step  and  support  from  aid  partners \n(UNPFA and UNICEF), MOPH through its National HIV/AIDS Control Program (NACP) together \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  had  also  organized  a  Religious  Leaders  National \nConsultative  Conference  on  HIV/AIDS  in  July  2004,  where  the  role  of  religious  leaders  on \nraising awareness on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was identified and a \nfuture action plan was prepared. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nThe Current Human Trafficking Situation \n\nC. \n \n4. \nHuman  trafficking  is  the  forced  removal  and  migration  of  people  against  their  will. \nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, Afghanistan is prone to both internal \nand  international  trafficking.  Human  trafficking  victims  are  often  women  and  children,  usually \ndestined  for  Middle  Eastern  countries.  There  are  numerous  types  of  human  trafficking-related \nactivities,  some  of  which  are  internal  and  others  international,  but  many  of  which  have  been \nlinked to poverty in the country. They include (i) commercial sex work, (ii) supposed forced labor \nin  the  carpet  industry  and  servitude  (as  believed  by  the  local  nongovernment  organizations \n[NGOs]),  (iii)  supposed  forced  recruitment  into  armed  groups,  (iv)  supposed  forced  religious \ntraining, and (v) sale of body organs. Poppy cultivation is also supposed to be a sign of poverty \nand human trafficking for labor, but it is said that people voluntarily cultivate poppy as it provides \nsubstantial  financial  return.  One  of  the  key  concerns  of  the  Central  and  South  Asia  Transport \nand  Trade  Forum  (CSATTF)2 \nthe  key \nis  prevention  of  human \nrecommendations  is  to  develop,  fund,  and  implement  training  programs  for  judicial,  legal, \nmedical,  and  social  services  for  police  and  customs  and/or  immigration  personnel  to  sensitize \nthem  to  the  serious  nature  of  trafficking  in  persons  and  the  gender-based  violence  it  often \nentails. Awareness and training programs will enable them to identify situations of trafficking in \npersons and to treat the victims adequately. It was also proposed that the training programs be \ncarried  out  together  with  specialized  NGOs  to  improve  cooperation  between  NGOs  and  the \nauthorities. \n \nD. \n\nGuiding  Principles  of  the  Strategy  for  HIV/AIDS  and  Anti-Human  Trafficking \nAwareness  \n\ntrafficking.  One  of \n\n \n5. \nMany  international  and  national  NGOs,  UNICEF,  WHO,  and  UNFPA  are  all  working  in \nthe area of HIV/AIDS and STIs in Afghanistan. However, a common refrain is that HIV/AIDS is a \ndifficult issue to broach in a conservative society like that in Afghanistan. After consultation with \naid  agencies  (WHO,  UNFPA),  international  NGOs,  local  NGOs,  and  MOPH,  the  following \nguiding principles for this component were formulated: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAn  awareness  program  on  HIV/AIDS  will  be  designed  in  line  with  NACP.  Any \nintervention  program  should  be  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with \nMOPH and in consultation with other aid partners. \nSensitization workshops will be carried out by MOPH with support from aid partners \nfor  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  Department  of  Religious  Affairs,  and  partner \nNGOs  to  emphasize  the  linkage  between  construction  of  highways/cross-border \nfacilities and transmission of HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking. \nHIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking awareness will be implemented not as a stand-\nalone component but rather integrated with relevant ongoing aid assisted projects or \nelse  discussed  along  with  other  priority  issues  linked  to  basic  health  services, \nreproductive health, hygiene awareness, and literacy programs.  \nFor  better  outreach,  community  leaders,  opinion  leaders,  religious  leaders,  and \nwomen\u2019s  organizations  will  be  involved  to  provide  community-level  awareness  and \ntraining on HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking. \n\n                                                 \n2 The main objective of the CSATTF is enhanced economic development through promotion of transport and trade. \n\nMembers include Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(v) \n\nAs a starting point, HIV/AIDS and STIs and anti-human trafficking awareness will be \ninitiated in the cities/urban areas, marketplaces; once successful, the issues will be \ndisseminated in the remote areas.3 \n\n(vi)  MPW with assistance from MOPH will collaborate with different aid partners (WHO, \nUNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, and others) to prepare a detailed operational plan for \nHIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking awareness for the Project. \n\n(vii)  MPW with assistance from the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) will collaborate with \ndifferent  aid  partners  (WHO,  UNFPA,  UNICEF,  World  Bank,  UNODC,  UNICEF  and \nothers)  to  seek  technical  expertise  on  training,  capacity  building  on  HIV/AIDS  and \nant-human  trafficking  issues,  and  support  for  counselling,  condom  distribution,  and \ntreatment services. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Support \n\n \nE. \n \n6. \nBased  on  the  seven  guiding  principles,  the  following  activities  have  been  proposed  as \npart of the Project. Further details will be discussed and an operational plan will be prepared in \ncollaboration  with  MPW,  MOH,  aid  partners  (WHO,  UNFPA,  UNICEF,  World  Bank,  United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crimes [UNODC] and others), and NGOs during implementation.  \n \n7. \nawareness subcomponent are the: \n \n\nHIV/AIDS  Subcomponent.  The  key  areas  of  activities  of  the  following  HIV/AIDS \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\norientation and sensitization of MPW, MOPH, and project personnel on HIV/AIDS \nand STIs; \nformation of advocacy groups on HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention within the \nprovincial  and  district  administration,  including  the  Department  of  Religious \nAffairs, and briefing them on the same; \nconducting briefing sessions for imams, mullahs at the district level, and opinion \nleaders and community leaders at the village/community level; \nraising  HIV/AIDS  awareness  for  contractors,  construction  workers,  IDUs,  and \ncommunities  and  villages  along  the  project  road  with  referral  information  and \ncondom distribution; \npublic  awareness  campaign  for  high-risk  groups  (e.g.,  truck  drivers/helpers, \nidentified  SWs,  construction  workers,  IDUs,  and  vulnerable  groups)  and  the \ngeneral  public  along  the  project  road  through  video  films/documentaries, \ninformation  education  communication  materials  at  key  spots  (rest  areas, \nmarketplaces, hospitals, and clinics) and door-to-door counseling;  \npromotion  and  distribution  of  condoms  at  critical  points  and  during  training  for \nawareness raising; and \n\n(vii)   giving  out  referral  information  on  the  nearest  available  services  for  testing, \n\ncounseling, and treatment. \n\n \nAnti-Trafficking  Subcomponent.  The  anti-trafficking  awareness  subcomponent  will \n\n8. \nhave these key areas of activities: \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Presently, only generating awareness on the health implications of HIV/AIDS is being carried out.  Discussions of \nsuch issues as sex and the use of condoms are taboo.  Nevertheless, these issues could be gradually introduced \nby taking into confidence the community and opinion leaders and religious leaders. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nsensitization  and  capacity  building  for  MPW,  MOPH,  project  personnel,  border \npolice, customs officials, and local NGOs on the issue of anti-human trafficking; \nand \nraising  public  awareness  through  public  media  and  information  education \ncommunication  materials  including  hoardings  in  the  important  junctions  and \ntarget  group  of  commercial  SWs,  vulnerable  groups  especially  women  and \nchildren. Awareness generation will focus on (a) conveying a behavioral change \nmessage;  (b)  providing  safe  migration  tips  especially  to  high  risk  groups,  and \nequipping  them  with  information  on  police  telephone  numbers  and  other \nnecessary  resources;  (c)  assisting  local  NGOs  to  coordinate  with  the  police  to \ninvestigate  suspected  transporters  and  human  traffickers;  (d)  networking  in \nAfghanistan  with  NGOs  and  international  aid  agencies,  and  support  efforts  to \nidentify  and  rescue  trafficked  women,  men,  and  children  and  provide  family \nrehabilitation;  (e)  training  police,  customs,  and  other  relevant  organizations  and \ncommunity in the vulnerability and dangers of Human trafficking; (f) strengthening \nformal  links  of  local  NGOs  with  the  border  police  and  the  immigration/customs \ndepartment; (g) assisting the police and immigration and/or customs department \nto  further  build  capacity  and  expedite  the  development  of  a  framework  and \nprocedures  to  identify  suspected  human  trafficking;  and  (h)  strengthening  the \nNGO  intelligence  information  database  and  information  sharing  arrangements \nwith customs and police counterparts.   \n\n \nImplementation  \n\nF. \n \nThe component will be executed intermittently for a period of 2 years. MPW will be the \n9. \nexecuting agency with responsibility for overall implementation through its project management \nunit  (PMU).  An  official,  deputed  from  MOPH  in  the  PMU,  will  be  responsible  for  providing \ntechnical support in terms of training, capacity building, and designing awareness programs in \ncollaboration  with  the  other  aid  agencies  (WHO,  UNFPA,  World  Bank,  UNODC,  UNICEF,  and \nothers);  assisting  in  networking  with  partner  NGOs,  religious  leaders,  community/opinion \nleaders;  preparing  terms  of  reference;  and  engaging  suitable  NGO  partners  for  program \nimplementation. Two local NGOs (or one big local NGO with adequate manpower) are expected \nto be recruited for the purpose. The NGOs will have prior experience in working on the issue of \nreproductive  health,  HIV/AIDS/STI  awareness,  and  anti-human  trafficking.  Target  groups  are \nconstruction  workers,  truckers,  SWs,  IDUs,  immigration/customs  and  police  officials,  and  the \nlocal population in the immediate project influence area. While the construction workers will be \naddressed  at  the  construction  sites/camps,  truckers  will  be  addressed  at  eating  places  in  the \ntown  markets.  The  local  population  willbe  addressed  through  a  door-to-door  campaign.  MPW \nthrough the support of the deputed official of MOPH will coordinate and monitor the day-to-day \nexecution  of  the  program  through  the  NGOs.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  health  specialist \nand gender specialist based in the Afghanistan Resident Mission will provide technical support, \nand review and monitor program implementation regularly. \n \nG.  \n \n10.  MPW  through  its  PMU  assisted  by  the  deputed  official  from  MOPH  will  be  responsible \nfor overall monitoring of the program. Monitoring and evaluation for this program will be based \non  activities  undertaken  through  NGOs.  The  NGOs  will  be  required  to  submit  (i)  a \nplanning/inception report (ii) quarterly reports (iii) annual reports, and (iv) a final report. \n \n\nReporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCost Estimates \n\nH.  \n \n11. \nTable A4.  \n \n\nThe cost for the activities is estimated at $100,000.

The  project  road  runs  through  flat  (50%),  rolling \n(23%), and mountainous (27%) terrain. The physical condition of the existing road is as follows:  \n \n\n(i)   \n\nBala Murghab (km 253, altitude 467 meters [m]) to Curutu (km 264, altitude 580 \nm) (ADB portion) \n(a)  Total length: 11 km \n(b)  Terrain: flat  11  \n(c)  1 bridge of total length 120 m \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nCurutu  (km  264,  altitude  580  m)  to  Khazara  Qala,  Qaisar  District  (km  343, \naltitude 976 m) (ADB portion) \n(a)  Total length: 79 km \n(b)  Terrain: flat 36 km rolling 15 km mountainous 28 km \n(c)  6 bridges total length of 580 m \n\n \n2. \nProposed  Design  Standards. The design standards proposed for the project road are \nthose  generally  adopted  in  Afghanistan,  which  refer  to  the  American  Association  of  State \nHighway  and  Transportation  Officials  standards.  For  different  terrain  conditions,  minimum \ndesign standards corresponding to the following design speeds are adopted: (i) flat terrain (80 \nkm/hour),  (ii)  rolling  terrain  (60  km/hour),  and  (iii)  mountainous  terrain(40  km/hour).  The  main \ngeometric  standard  parameters  are  in  Table  A5.  The  typical  cross  section  suggested  for  the \nroad in flat and rolling terrains is of two traffic lanes each 3.50 m wide, with two hard shoulders \nof 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of 11.0 m. To reduce the construction cost in \nmountainous  terrain,  the  typical  cross  section  suggested  is  reduced  from  10.0  m  to  8.0  m,  by \nreducing  the  width  of  the  shoulders  to  0.5  m.  The  suggested  pavement  design  includes  a  90 \nmillimeter asphalt concrete layer. \n\n \nTable A5: Main Parameters of Geometric Design Standards for the Project \n\nDesign Element \n\nUnit \n\nFlat \n\nRolling  Mountainous Urban \n\nDesign Speed \nMinimum Stopping Sight Distance \nMinimum Passing Sight Distance \nMinimum Horizontal Radius \nMinimum Horizontal Radius (exceptional) \nTransition Curves Required \nMaximum Gradient \nMaximum Gradient (exceptional) \nMaximum Superelevation \nMinimum Crest Vertical Radius \nMinimum Sag Vertical Radius \nMinimum Vertical Radius (exceptional) \nTraffic Lane Normal Crossfall \nShoulder Normal Crossfall \n\u2014 = not available, h = hour, km = kilometer, m = meter. \nSource: Feasibility study for the Herat-Andkhoy Road Improvement Project. \n\n80 \n110 \n275 \n175 \n\u2014 \nYes \n6 \n\u2014 \n7 \n6,000 \n3,000 \n\u2014 \n2.5 \n4 \n\nkm/h \nm \nm \nm \nm \n \n% \n% \n% \nm \nm \n\u2014 \n% \n% \n\n60 \n85 \n225 \n125 \n\u2014 \nYes \n8 \n\u2014 \n7 \n2,500 \n2,000 \n\u2014 \n2.5 \n4 \n\n40 \n55 \n125 \n50 \n25 \nNo \n14 \n18 \n7 \n1,500 \n1,000 \n600 \n2.5 \n4 \n\n50 \n55 \n175 \n50 \n\u2014 \nNo \n14 \n18 \n4 \n2,000 \n1,000 \n\u2014 \n2.5 \n4 \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nItem\n\nA.

Because it is recognizes of the importance of an efficient, reliable road network in a landlocked country \nand its contribution to poverty reduction. The inadequate road system keeps many farmers dependent on subsistence \nagriculture with no, or limited, access to markets, education, and health care. The project road (90 km) from Qaisar to \nBala Murghab is part of the 550 km stretch of road between Herat and Andkhoy, which runs through one of the most \nremote  and  least  developed  areas  of  the  country.  The  existing  road  was  never  paved  and  is  merely  a  track  of  mud \nroad where most sections easily turn impassable after the rains. Rehabilitating and improving this road to a standard \nallowing easy motor vehicle movement will complete the missing link of the ring road and facilitate political integration \nof  the  country,  contributing  to  employment  creation,  and  income  generation  for  poor  households,  rehabilitation  of \ninternally  and/or  internationally  displaced  persons  and  ex-combatants. The  road  will  also  open  up  a  trade  route  that \nconnects  the  northern  part  of  Afghanistan  and  neighboring  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  to  the  western  part  of  the \ncountry, and further to Iran, forming a subregional road transport corridor. The project proposes to utilize, to the extent \npossible,  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to  provide  much-needed  employment  and  income-generating \nopportunities  during  project  implementation,  and  use  the  services  of  the  local  population  for  the  post-construction \nmaintenance  activities.  It  will  contribute  to  social  stability  and  poverty  reduction  by  engaging,  among  others  the \nrefugees  and  ex-combatants.  Thus,  the  investment  is  expected  to  significantly  improve  the  socioeconomic  situation \nand mitigate the pervasive poverty in the project area.  \n\n \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                            Poverty Classification:  General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nIn Afghanistan, approximately 53% of the population are classified as poor1 and live on less than $1 a day.  The road \npasses  through  the  provinces  of  Faryab  and  Badghis  and  the  project  influence  area  is  known  to  be  drought  prone. \nPeople  have  traditionally  grown  poppy  because  the  absence  of  a  good  road  and  public  transport  system  prevents \nthem from selling their marketable crop surpluses. The prolonged war in the country further aggravated by drought has \nseverely  affected  the  livelihood  sources  of  the  local  population.  Only  in  areas  such  as  Gormach,  Bala  Murghab  in \nBadghis Province, where some irrigation facilities are available due to the presence of a flowing river, people cultivate \nwheat and watermelon instead of poppy.2 Decreased farm productivity due to prolonged drought has been the norm; \nhowever, this year\u2019s monsoons have been unprecedented in the last 20 years and farmers have farmed even hilltops \nand  desert  lands.  The  sample  household  survey  and  consultations  carried  out  revealed  that  almost  90%  of  the \nhouseholds were engaged in subsistence agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood, while the rest had small \nbusinesses in the towns. Only in the Qaisar region are cash crops like raisins grown with marketable surpluses. The \nsurvey also revealed that the households in the project area are extremely poor, with an average monthly income of \napproximately AF2,000 and an average household size of 5.5. Households near the Bala Murghab section of the road \ndo not have cash income, as the crops they grow are not even sufficient for their consumption. Thus, reduced farm \nproductivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for agriculture labor are two of the main determinants of poverty in the \narea. \n \nAfghanistan ranks the 4th highest in mortality of those under five at 257 deaths/1,000. The infant mortality rate is at a \nhigh 165/1,000.The survey also indicated that there  were  no government hospitals or primary health care centers in \nthe four towns (Kaizar, Chechaktu, Chilgasi, and Gormach) to be traversed by the project road.  The local population \ndepend primarily on private clinics present in the four towns for minor ailments or routine checkups. For any serious \nillness, they hire private vehicles and travel 3\u20138 hours by road to reach the two provincial capitals of Qalai-Naw and \nMaimana to avail themselves of better health care facilities. Due to lack of a public transport system in the area, the \nrental  charges  of  private  vehicles  are  extremely  high  and  thus  health  care  is  considered  an  expensive  proposition. \nLack of adequate educational facilities was also another major problem in the project area. Although the towns of both \nQaisar  and  Gormach  had  primary  and  secondary  schools,  Gormach,  which  was  worse  affected  during  the  Taliban \nregime,  did  not  have  teachers  and,  consequently,  no  students.  Poor  road  conditions  and  accessibility  and  lack  of \nsecurity in the project area discourage teachers from other parts of Afghanistan from working in this region.   \n                                                                  \n1   ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Afghanistan. Manila \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n43\n\nThe  project  would  lead  to  both  direct  and  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  direct  poverty  impact  would  be \nincome generation and demand for unskilled labor and wages accruing to the area during construction of the project \nroad. Other benefits will become evident in lower travel costs and higher agricultural product profit margins.  Improved \nroads  and  better  connectivity  will  allow  farmers  to  grow  larger  marketable  surpluses  that,  in  turn,  can  provide  more \nagricultural  wage  employment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor.  Road  improvement  will  also  facilitate  more  timely \naccess to schools, medical clinics and employment centers. Lower transportation costs will increase mobility that will \nallow the poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. The project will also provide more reliable access to \nsocial services, particularly health care services and education facilities. Another important impact of increased access \nto local, national, and international markets will be growth of local trade, and production activities, and reduced prices \nof  agricultural  commodities  and  other  products.  With  improved  regional  trade  and  transit,  new  employment \nopportunities  will  be  generated,  facilitating  rehabilitation  of  displaced  populations  and  ex-combatants,  inter-ethnic \nreconciliation,  and  improvement  of  security  and  stability.  The  benefit  of  the  improved  road  in  terms  of  reduction  of \nvehicle operating costs will not only be transferred to the road users but will also decrease the chances of deaths and \ndisabilities from accidents due to  extremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic activity and easy access \nto social services are expected to significantly increase household incomes and quality of life, thereby reducing overall \npoverty incidence.  \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n  No \n  No \n\n  Yes \n  Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  project  has  identified  and  consulted  with  the  key  primary  and  secondary  project  stakeholders  in  the  prominent \ntowns and the project influence area. During the course of social analysis, consultations and meetings with the various \nproject  communities  including  farmers,  small  shop  owners,  traders,  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  were \norganized  to  ascertain  their  response  to  construction  of  the  road,  their  needs  and  demands  from  the  project.  Apart \nfrom the public meetings, focus group discussions  were organized  with the  young, old, men and  women of different \noccupations and population groups to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the project as well as its impacts. All \nthose consulted unanimously welcomed the benefits that improved access and/or road conditions would provide.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in the project area, as those in much of Afghanistan, have a role that is secondary to that of men. Women are \nbasically confined to household activities, including taking care of children and providing input to the agriculture sector, \nwith  only  a  few  coming  to  the  workplace  in  recent  years  and  gaining  an  education.  They  lack  authority  over  the \nresources and power in decision-making in major household and other economic activities. Women in Afghanistan are \ngenerally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice of education, and participation in the decision-\nmaking  process  for  household  economic  activities.  The  women  in  the  project  influence  area  are  engaged  in \nagricultural activities and carpet making. The project will provide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times \nand  transport  costs  that  will  result  in  more  cash  income  for  the  household.  With  the  improved  road  combined  with \nincreased  transportation  facilities,  women  will  find  it  easier  to  reach  schools,  clinics,  and  hospitals,  bazaars,  food \nmarkets, and other market centers, and, if needed, to go to district and provincial capitals. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n2   United Nations Office of Drug Control (UNODC) has initiated a drive to eradicate poppy cultivation throughout the \n\ncountry, especially in this region. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nland  acquisition  will  be  minimal \n\nOverall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  of  the \nproject  is  not  significant.  Most  improvement  works  will  be \ncarried  out  within  the  existing  rights-of-way  except  that \nagricultural \n(0.08 \nhectare[ha]). Small amounts  of privately  owned commercial \n(0.06 ha) and residential (0.02 ha) land will also be affected. \nNone  of  the  residential  and  commercial  structure  owners/ \ntitleholders  will  be  displaced  or  relocated.  Only  three \ncommercial  squatter  households  will  get  displaced  and  will \nbe  relocated/pushed  back  within  the  available  government \nland.  Residential  structures  will  lose  only  their  earthen \nboundary walls. Commercial structures will lose a very small \nportion  of  their  commercial  land  and  parapets/temporary \nextensions or shades of their shops.  Land take and impact \non  commercial  land  in  the  town  areas  can  be  further \nminimized  or \ncompletely  avoided  during  detailed \nengineering  design,  if  the  design  stipulation  of  0.5  meter  of \nverges on each side of the road is compromised in the built-\nup areas of Gormach and Chilgasi. \nBoth  the  rich  and  the  poor  will  benefit  from  rapid  market \naccess  and  access \nto  better  quality  of  goods.  The \ncommunity  will  have  better  access  to  provincial  and  cross \nborder  markets  at  no  additional  cost  to  them.  On  the  other \nhand,  reduction  in  travel  time  and  transport  costs  is \nexpected to result in reduced transport service charges and \nimprove affordability of transport services in the project area, \nthereby benefiting the poor. \nNo job losses will occur. The project is expected to generate \nemployment  opportunities  for  local  communities  during  the \nconstruction  phase,  and  thereafter  for  maintenance.  The \nproject  will  utilize  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to \nprovide  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities. \nEfforts will be made to engage, among others, refugees and \nex-combatants. The project will comply with the Core Labor \nStandards (CLS).3\nSocial  analysis  found  no  indigenous  people  in  the  project \narea. \n\nThe  household  survey  did  not  record  any  other  risks, \nincluding  that  of  human  trafficking  and  STI/HIV/AIDS. 4   \nHowever, considering the possible risks of human trafficking \nand  HIV/AIDS  transmission  in  the  long  run  a  strategy  for  \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  has  been  prepared.  In  addition,  a \nsuitable  clause  in  the  civil  works  contracts  will  require  the \ncontractors \ninformation,  education,  and \ncommunication  activities  related  to  HIV/AIDS  for  their \nemployees. \n\nto  conduct \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n                                                                  \n3   Afghanistan  has  an  obligation  as  member  of  the  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  to  respect,  promote,  and \nrealize the principles concerning the fundamental Core Labor Standards (CLS): (i) elimination of all forms of forced \nor  compulsory  labor,  (ii)  abolition  of  child  labor,  (iii)  elimination  of  discrimination  in  respect  of  employment  and \noccupation, and (iv) freedom  of association  and recognition of the right of  collective bargaining.

Although the Asian Development Bank finances a portion of the section of about 90 \nkilometers (km), the remainder of the section will be constructed in parallel using other financing \nsources.  This  is  considered  reasonable  as  the  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  mainly  to \ngenerated and induced traffic with the completion of the section. The analysis used the highway \ndesign  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  with  modification  for  conditions  in  Afghanistan.  Data \nunder  the  same  conditions  in  neighboring  countries  were  adopted  for  unavailable  input  data. \nEconomic evaluation was made by comparing cases of with and without the Project. The case \nwithout the  Project reflects the current practice of doing nothing but keeping passability at the \nexisting level. \n \n2. \nThe  project  road  was  evaluated  for  a  benefit  period  of  20  years,  up  to  and  including \n2028.  A  residual  value  of  10%  was  applied  in  2028.  The  improved  road  will  reduce  operating \ncosts and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus in economic growth in the project area. All \nbenefits and costs are expressed in 2005 constant prices. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nHomogeneous  sections  are  defined  based  on  traffic  volumes  derived  from  the  traffic \nanalysis, road geometry, and roughness observed during the surveys, and altitude and gradient \nof the road. The road is divided into 10 homogeneous sections (Table A11.1).  \n \n\nRoad Conditions \n\nTable A11.1: Road Condition Data \n\n \nSection \n\nChainnage \n\n \n\nHerat-Karukh \nKarukh-Qalai-Naw \nQalai-Naw to Murghab \nMurghab to Chelgasi \nChelgasi to Maimana \nMaimana to Andhkoy \n\nRF \n(m/km) \n10 \n30 \n25 \n25 \n15 \n10 \ndeg = degree, km = kilometer, m = meter, RF = rise and fall. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n \n0\u201460 \n60\u2014145 \n145\u2014253 \n253\u2014366 \n366\u2014424 \n424\u2014553 \n\n \nC. \n \n\nTraffic Demand \n\n1. \n\nExisting Traffic \n\nExisting Conditions \nCurvature \n(deg/km) \n15 \n45 \n30 \n30 \n20 \n15 \n\nRoughness \n(m/km) \n8 \n15 \n15 \n15 \n15 \n15 \n\n \nClassified  traffic  volumes  on  the  project  road  were  estimated  based  on  traffic  surveys \n4. \nundertaken  in  April  and  May  2004  when  traffic  volume  at  the  annually  average  level  was \nobserved.

Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and \nduties. Taxes and duties in Afghanistan are virtually zero at present. Following the Emergency \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, a standard conversion factor of 0.9 was \napplied  to  nontradables  to  convert  financial  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  costs  to  economic \ncosts. \n \nThree  alternative  pavement  standards  were  considered:  double  bitumen  surface \n8. \ntreatment (DBST); AC 50 millimeter (mm) on granular base; and AC 90 mm on granular base. \nThe  project  road  cost  estimates  in  economic  terms  are  in  Table  A11.5.

VOC savings were calculated using HDM4 for each \nvehicle type. Following the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, \nthe value of time per vehicle was estimated at $0.38 plus $0.11 per passenger, and $0.50 per \ntruck plus $0.25 per passenger. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to savings in \ntravel  time.  The  benefits  for  generated  traffic  are  considered  to  be  50%  of  those  for  normal \ntraffic. \n \n\n3.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n10. \nAn economic evaluation was undertaken by section. The maintenance standard for the \ndo-nothing case is spot-graveling every year to keep the surface condition at the minimum level \nof  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  =  15.  For  the  with-project  case, overlay  is  applied  when \nthe roughness of the road surface reaches IRI 5 m/km.   \n \n11. \nThe calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the overall project road \nresults  in  17.4%,  18.4%,  and  18.8%  for  alternatives  1,  2,  and  3,  respectively,  considering  the \nsavings from VOCs and travel as benefits. Alternative 3 (AC 90 mm) was found to be the least- \ncost  design,  considering  the  life-cycle  costs.

Five \nsensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  construction  costs  increase  by  25%,  (ii)  construction \ncompletion is delayed by 1 year, (iii) no time savings are considered, (iv) no generated traffic is \nobserved,  and  (v)  traffic  growth  rate  decreases  by  50%.  The  results  show  that  the  quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests for the overall project road. \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\n \n\n \n\nTable A11.7: Results of Sensitivity Tests for Alternative 3 (AC 90 mm) \n \n\nCase \n\nBase Case \n\n(i)   25% increase in construction costs   \n\n(ii)  Construction completion delayed by 1 year \n(iii) No time savings \n\n(iv) No generated traffic \n\n(v)  50% decrease in traffic growth rates   \n\nEIRR  \n(%) \n18.8 \n16.3 \n17.8 \n18.5 \n12.5 \n15.3 \n12.7 \n\n(vi) Combination of (i) and (v) \nAC = asphalt concrete, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, mm = millimeter.   \nSources: Asian Development Bank and consultant\u2019s estimates. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 June 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013  afghani/s (AF) \n", "AF1.00\n$1.00\n", "=  $0.02010 \n=  AF49.740 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "AC \nADB \nADF \nAIDS \nARDS \nCND \nCSATTF \nDBST \nDDR \nEIRR \nEIRRP \nHDM \nHIV \nICB \nIDU \nIEE \nIRI \nISAF \nMOF \nMOPH \nMOT \nMPW \nNACP \nNGO \nPIU \nPMU \nPRR \nPRT \nSTI \nSW \nTA \nTSR \nUNFPA \nUNICEF \nUNODC \nUSAID \nWHO \nVOC \n", "\u2013  asphalt concrete \n\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asian Development Fund \n\u2013  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  \n\u2013  Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services \n\u2013  Counter Narcotics Directorate \n\u2013  Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum \n\u2013  double bitumen surface treatment \n\u2013  disarmament, demobilization, and integration program \n\u2013  economic internal rate of return \n\u2013  Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project \n\u2013  highway design and maintenance \n\u2013  human immunodeficiency virus  \ninternational competitive bidding \n\u2013 \ninject drug user \n\u2013 \ninitial environmental examination  \n\u2013 \ninternational roughness index \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \ninternational security assistance force \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Health \n\u2013  Ministry of Transport \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \n\u2013  National HIV/AIDS Control Program \n\u2013  nongovernment organization \n\u2013  project implementation unit \n\u2013  project management unit \n\u2013  priority reform and restructuring \n\u2013  provincial reconstruction team \n\u2013  sexually transmitted infection \n\u2013  sex worker \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations Population Fund \n\u2013  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n\u2013  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes \n\u2013  United States Agency for International Development \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n\u2013  vehicle operating cost \n", "technical assistance  \ntransport sector review \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ha \nkm \nkm2 \nmm \nm \nt \n", "hectare \nKilometer \nsquare kilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  millimeter \n\u2013  meter \n\u2013 \n", "ton \n \nNOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 19 March.
