Although  the \n2. \nelectrification rate of households in India has increased from 43% in 20001 to 75% in 2010,2 the \nquality  and  reliability  of  service  remain  suboptimal  and  rural  areas  in  particular  remain \nunderserved.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012  targeted  additional  capacity  of  79 \ngigawatts  (GW);  however,  actual  realization  was  only  55  GW.  The  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan, \n2012\u20132017  targets  an  addition  of  88  GW,  including  30  GW  of  renewable  energy  capacity. \nAlthough  the  12th  plan  sets  ambitious  targets  to  connect  all  villages  to  the  electricity  network, \nreliability  will  likely  remain  an  issue.  Because  of  continued  demand  growth,  power  supply  is \nexpected to continue to fall 10%\u201312% short of demand every year during the 12th plan.3  \n \n3. \nIndia also needs to preserve its energy mix, not only to combat climate change but also \nto ensure the country\u2019s energy security. Indigenous conventional fuels are diminishing and India \nhas to import increasing quantities of coal and liquefied natural gas. Increasing scarcity of water \nis putting pressure on coal-based power plants. Investing in renewable power mitigates import \ndependency and the impact of potential imported fuel price increases. The share of renewable \npower, including hydro power, in total installed capacity has declined from 44% in 1970 to 31% \nin  2011.  The  government  intends  to  stop  this  decline  and  has  set  a  goal  of  maintaining  the \nproportion of renewable power at its current level (31%) until 2023.4 \n \n4. \nThe  Indian  energy  sector  has  recently  seen  some  favorable  developments  that  are \ntargeted  to  increase  further  investments  in  the  sector,  and  particularly  in  renewable  power \ngeneration.  The  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Solar  Mission  was  launched  in  2010,  setting  the \ntarget for 20 GW of grid-connected solar power capacity by 2020. In addition to capacity that will \nbe developed under this mission with central government offtake (4 GW by 2017), the different \nstates have announced targets for capacity that will benefit from state utilities\u2019 offtake (6 GW by \n2017).5 Under  these  programs,  solar  developers  benefit  from  attractive  tariffs,  although  most \ntariffs are determined as a result of bids and solar tariffs are expected to decrease and reach \n\u201cgrid  parity\u201d  over  the  medium  term.6 In  the  wind  subsector,  the  seven  states  with  the  highest \nwind  potential  increased  their  wind  feed-in  tariffs  in  2012\u20132013  and  the  central  government \nannounced  the  reinstatement  of  the  generation-based  incentive  for  wind  projects  in  2013.7 In \nSeptember 2012, the central government approved a large financial restructuring plan for state \n                                                 \n1  International Energy Agency (IEA). 2002.

HSBC forecasts grid parity for solar over 2016\u20132018. \n7   The generation-based incentive provides an incentive of Rs0.5 per kilowatt-hour paid by the central government, in \naddition to the feed-in-tariff paid by state utilities (in the range of Rs3.5\u2013Rs5.9 per kilowatt-hour in the seven states \nwith the highest wind potential). See Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f 2\n\nelectricity boards. Several state electricity boards are in bad financial health and the plan aims \nto strengthen their balance sheet to encourage investments across the energy sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nThe  project  enables  the  funding  of  WREL\u2019s  equity  injection  in  a  portfolio  of  solar \nphotovoltaic  and  wind  power  projects  with  a  total  capacity  of  approximately  300  megawatts \n(MW) to be commissioned from December 2013 to March 2016. Although the exact composition \nof the portfolio might change as a result of public bid awards and other business considerations, \nWREL expects its portfolio to grow by at least 200 MW of solar power projects and 100 MW of \nwind power projects from December 2013 to March 2016.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Company and Sponsors \n\n6. \nWREL is one of the leading renewable power developers in India. As of November 2013, \nWREL  had  309  MW  of  operational  projects  (289  MW  of  solar  projects  in  Andhra  Pradesh, \nGujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  and  Rajasthan;  and  20  MW  of  wind  projects  in \nRajasthan),  211  MW  of  projects  under  construction  (119  MW  solar  and  92  MW  wind),  and  a \npipeline  of  1.2  GW  of  projects  at  various  stages  of  development.  The  project  will  help  the \ncompany reach at least 600 MW of operational projects by March 2016.  \n \n7. \nWREL  is  100%  owned  by  Welspun  Energy  Limited  (WEL),  which  is  in  turn  owned  by \nWelspun  Corp  Limited  and  indirectly  by  two  individual  sponsors:  B.  K.  Goenka    and  Vineet \nMittal.  The  Welspun  Group  is  a  large  Indian  conglomerate  engaged  in  textiles,  steel  pipes,  oil \nand  gas,  and  infrastructure  with  an  annual  turnover  of  approximately  $2.6  billion.  Welspun \nTextile is the third-largest home textile producer in the world, while Welspun Corp is the second-\nlargest large-diameter pipe company in the world. WEL is the power arm of the Welspun Group \nand  is  engaged  in  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  for  power  projects  (mainly  for \nWREL\u2019s projects) and ownership of power generation projects, both renewable (through WREL) \nand thermal. B. K. Goenka is the chairman of the Welspun Group. V. Mittal started and ran one \nof  the  biggest  outsourcing  companies  in  India,  and  is  a  member  of  the  advisory  panel  of  the \nSolar Energy Advisory Council of the Government of India. 8 \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n8. \nThe project will contribute to the continued development of renewable energy generation \nin India. In doing so, it will help preserve India\u2019s energy mix by increasing the country\u2019s reliance \non indigenous energy sources as opposed to imported fuels. The project will contribute to the \nnational goal of at least maintaining the proportion of renewable power (including hydro power) \nin total installed capacity at its current level (31%) until 2023. \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s assistance will also support private sector development. It will help demonstrate \nthat profitable investments are achievable in the renewable power subsector and, as such, will \ncatalyze  more  private  investments  in  renewable  energy.  Supported  by  favorable  government \npolicies for renewable power, the private sector share in the total installed capacity of renewable \nenergy in India is expected to increase from 33% in 2011 to 50% in 2023. \n\n                                                 \n8   V. Mittal received several distinctions, including Solar Man of the Year from EQ International magazine in 2012. \n\n\f \n\n  3\n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n10. \nThe  project's  outcome  is  the  demonstrated  viability  and  sustainability  of  renewable \nenergy projects in the private sector. The project is expected to generate 540 gigawatt-hours of \nelectricity annually and avoid 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from FY2017 \nonwards. The project will further contribute to local employment and tax revenues.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  output  is  the  development  and  commissioning  of  a  portfolio  of  200  MW  of \n\n11.  \nsolar photovoltaic power projects and 100 MW of wind power projects by March 2016. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020.9 It relates to two of the strategy\u2019s five \n12.  \ncore pillars: infrastructure and environment. The strategy calls for ADB support to clean energy \ndevelopment  to  meet  growing  energy  demands  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  project  will  also \ncontribute  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  goal  of  scaling  up  private  sector  development.  The  project  is \naligned with the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, which calls for \u201cinvestments in \nrenewable energy development, particularly solar.\u201d10 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nThe project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.11 The policy states that support for \n13.  \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. Starting in 2013, ADB will increase \nits target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from the previous target of $1 billion a \nyear. As part of the policy implementation, ADB is emphasizing private sector participation as a \ntool  to  increase  energy  sector  efficiency  by  introducing  increased  competition  and  increased \ninvestable  resources.  The  proposed  investment  also  contributes  to  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Solar  Energy \nInitiative and complements previous interventions in the solar industry in India. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n14. \nNo independent evaluation has been undertaken yet on prior nonsovereign investments \nby ADB in the solar industry. Lessons based on staff experience point to (i) the importance of \nfeed-in tariffs for renewable energy; (ii) the importance of the quality of panel suppliers, as well \nas their level of warranties and creditworthiness; and (iii) the need for verification of generation \nlosses due to dust and other soiling factors, especially in desert areas of India. To date, India \nand Thailand are the only two countries in Asia that have appropriate feed-in tariffs in place in \ncombination  with  credible  supporting  government  policies.  The  project  is  mitigating  risks \nassociated with panel supply by the fact that the quality of the solar panels, the adequacy of the \nwarranties, as well as the reputation of the supplier selected by WREL have been confirmed by \nADB\u2019s  independent  engineer.  The  independent  engineer  confirmed  that  WREL  has  adequate \noperations  and  maintenance  capacity  in  place  to  minimize  generation  loss,  and  that  soiling \nlosses have been taken into account when calculating net generation.  \n                                                 \n9 ADB.  2008.

Manila.  \n\n\f 4\n\n16. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nThe extended annual reviews of private sector wind projects previously financed by ADB \n15. \nin India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance of wind resource assessment, (ii) the \nrisks associated with land acquisition if forest land is included in the scope of the project, and \n(iii)  the  need  for  more  power  evacuation  facilities.  WREL\u2019s  project  selection  aims  to  mitigate \nthese risks by (i) relying on multiple wind data sources, such as external databases as well as \ndata from wind masts placed by WREL at various project sites; (ii) a land acquisition approach \nthat  avoids  forest  land;  and  (iii)  working  closely  with  local  offtakers  to  ensure  advance  grid \nplanning is completed where required.  \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nThe energy sector in India is regulated and administered through a multi-ministerial structure. The \nCERC is the central regulator. Individual states have a state ministry of power as well as SERCs. \nRenewable  energy  policies  are  embedded  in  the  framework  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003;  the \nNational  Electricity  Policy,  2005;  and  the  National  Tariff  Policy,  2006  (and  as  amended  in \nDecember  2010).  The  regulatory  environment  in  India  for  the  renewable  subsector  is  under \ncontinuous development and aims to encourage further significant private sector investments.  \nThe management team of WREL is headed by one of the sponsors, Vineet Mittal. He is supported \nby a team of professionals with ample experience in the renewable energy sector.  \nDecember 2013\u2013March 2016 \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation \nperiod \nConstruction arrangements \n\nType of \narrangement  \nEquipment \nSuppliers \nCivil works \n\nTransmission \nlines \n\nEPC contracts will be awarded in a transparent manner based on an assessment of the proposed \ncost, quality, time lines, and terms and conditions. \nEPC  contractors  will  source  thin  film  and  crystalline  solar  modules,  inverters,  wind  turbines, \ntransformers, and other necessary equipment from leading international suppliers. \nCivil works for the balance of the plant (including construction of common facilities, control rooms, \nand access roads) will be subcontracted to local trade contractors. \nPower  evacuation  facilities  will  be  made  by  the  respective  state  transmission  companies,  while \nshort connection lines are included as part of the EPC contract.  \n\nOperation arrangements \n\nRevenue \nstructure \nOperation \nand \nmaintenance \n\nFor all projects offtake will be fixed under long-term PPA (majority 25 years) with varying tariffs with \nthe respective state offtakers. \nOperation and maintenance of the solar plants will be done in-house at the project level. Training \nand support is offered by WREL. Operation and maintenance of the wind projects will be done by \nthe wind turbine supplier, generally for a 20-year period.  \nKey performance indicators will be reported by WREL and monitored by ADB. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nEPC  =  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction;  PPA  =  power  purchase  agreement;  WREL  =  Welspun \nRenewables Energy Limited.   \nSource: Welspun Renewables Energy Limited. \n \nE. \n\nUnique Features \n\n17. \nThe  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  largest  direct  equity  investment  in  renewable  energy  ($50 \nmillion)  and  it  will  be  ADB\u2019s  largest  nonsovereign  solar  power  project  in  size  (200  MW).  It  is \nnoteworthy that ADB will become the first external investor in WREL. In most other direct equity \ninvestments  so  far,  ADB  has  followed  first-round  private  equity  investors.  In  this  transaction, \nADB  is  taking  a  leading  structuring  role.  The  valuation,  corporate  governance  standards,  and \nminority  shareholder  protection  rights  negotiated  by  ADB  as  part  of  its  investment  will  help \nWREL attract further equity investment to support its growth.  \n \n\n\f \n\n  5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB will subscribe to common equity shares of WREL for an amount up to the lower of \n18. \n(i) the Indian rupee equivalent of $50 million, and (ii) such amount that represents 25% of the \nnet worth of WREL after the ADB investment. \n \nThe  equity  investment  has  been  structured  to  address  the  capital  needs  of  WREL.  It \n19. \nprovides  growth  capital  to  WREL  without  imposing  the  burden  of  interest  payments,  while  the \nasset base is being expanded. It will enable ADB to share the investment upside created by an \ninitial public offering (IPO) or a strategic sale. \n  \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n20. \nADB's  assistance  will  support  the  government's  policy  to  develop  renewable  energy.  It \nwill  strengthen  a  local  renewable  energy  sponsor  with  a  good  operational  track  record  and  a \ncommitment  to  comply  with  ADB's  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements.  In \naddition,  ADB\u2019s  investment  is  expected  to  be  catalytic  as  it  will  enable  the  company  to  raise \nequity  funds  from  other  investors.  As  such,  WREL  sees  ADB\u2019s  potential  assistance  as  a  key \nsuccess factor for subsequent fund raising and its future IPO. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n21. \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  is  considered  as  general  corporate  finance  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  it  is  classified  category  B  for \nenvironment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Although \nsolar and wind power projects involve potential environmental impacts during construction and \noperation (e.g. potential water and land pollution), these impacts are site-specific, reversible and \ncan  be  mitigated  using  tested  mitigation  measures.12 As  required  under  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  a  corporate  safeguards  audit  was  conducted  during  due  diligence.  A  corrective \naction  plan  which  describes  gap-filling  measures  at  the  corporate  and  project  level  was \nprepared  based  on  the  audit  findings.  WREL  will  be  required  to  adopt  an  environmental  and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  satisfactory  to  ADB  prior  to  ADB\u2019s  investment.  To  ensure \nadequate implementation of its ESMS, WREL has agreed to develop its capacity to oversee the \nESMS implementation at the corporate level and at the project level.  \n \n22. \nThe  project  team\u2019s  due  diligence  and  external  expert\u2019s  corporate  audit  found  that \nWREL\u2019s  existing  environmental  and  social  policies  and  systems  are  not  fully  aligned  with  the \nrequirements of ADB safeguards and social requirements. While there are existing procedures \nto screen, assess, and address environmental and social risks arising out of its portfolio of solar \nand  wind  power  projects,  there  are  still  improvements  required  to  ensure  compliance  and \n\n                                                 \n12  On the social aspects, due diligence found that selected WREL solar and wind power projects were located either \non  state-owned  lands  that  are  vacant  and  have  low  productivity  or  on  private  land  procured  through  negotiated \nsettlements.
