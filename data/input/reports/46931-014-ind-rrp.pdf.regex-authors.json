I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $2,000,000 in Simpa Networks (Simpa) for the Off-Grid Pay-As-You-\nGo Solar Power Project in India. \n \nII.  THE COMPANY  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  More people in India lack access to electricity than any other nation in the world; the \nInternational Energy Agency estimates the number at 400 million. Most live in rural areas \noutside the reach of conventional electricity grid networks. Solar photovoltaic technology offers \na  clean  alternative  to  address  off-grid  access  to  electricity.  Effective  decentralized  energy \nsolutions  using  solar  photovoltaic  technology,  such  as  solar  home  systems  (SHSs)  and \ncommunity-scale solar micro grids, involve significant upfront costs for rural consumers and \nhave limited market penetration.1 \n \n3.  From initial discussions with Simpa, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) believes that \nthe company offers a simple, affordable, and commercially sustainable clean energy solution to \naddress lack of electricity access in off-grid, largely rural areas. Moreover the successful initial \nrollout  of  SHSs  in  Karnataka  demonstrates  strong  market  demand  for  the  product.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment will enable Simpa to scale up its operations, and ADB\u2019s knowledge and experience \nwill be valuable to the company as it expands its operations. The decentralized energy solution \ndeveloped  by  Simpa  has  strong  potential  for  replication  across  other  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs). With its strong focus on the underserved rural poor, the ADB investment will \nbe a market leading initiative that would build on ADB\u2019s strong presence in solar energy in India. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n4.  Simpa  offers  a  secure,  prepaid  payment  platform  to  make  simple,  affordable,  and \ninvestible clean energy solutions for underserved consumers in India. The \u201ctechnology + service \n+ finance\u201d platform leverages mobile phones to unlock demand from consumers, while providing \nrisk mitigation for the company that finances the solar equipment. The technology platform \ncomprises a very low-cost prepaid meter supported by sophisticated cloud-based software. The \ntechnology can be embedded in standalone products such as an SHS and is also offered to \nsolar  micro  grid  developers  as  an  extremely  flexible  metering,  customer,  and  revenue \nmanagement solution.2 \n \n5.  An SHS consists of a module, a battery, a charge regulator, and compact fluorescent \nand/or light-emitting diode lamps. Sometimes other appliances, like an electric fan, can be \nincluded in the SHS. Simpa has developed a metering solution comprising a device\u2014the Simpa \ncontroller\u2014that locks up the energy flowing out of the battery connected to the SHS, which the \nconsumer can unlock to the extent needed by purchasing energy credits from Simpa through a \nsimple  and  quick  recharge  process  based  on  the  mobile  telephony  platform.  The  Simpa \ncontroller is a small electronic device with a keypad for inputting data, such as recharge codes, \nand has a simple liquid crystal display showing the energy credit balance available for use. The \n                                                 \n1  Centre for Development Finance; World Resources Institute. 2010. Power to the People: Investing in Clean Energy \nfor the Base of the Pyramid in India. Chennai. \n2  A micro grid is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and electricity demand centers that \noperates in isolation without connection to a traditional centralized transmission grid. \n ", "2    \n \nSimpa controller is integrated into a metal box along with the battery and the solar charge \nregulator; both are standard equipment in an SHS. \n \n6.  A customer who chooses a Simpa metering system-enabled SHS is given a choice of \npaying 10%, 20%, or 30% of the total cost of the SHS as a down payment, after which the SHS \nis installed on the customer\u2019s premises, typically on the roof of the house. After installation, the \ncustomer has a choice of how much energy credit to purchase from as low as Rs50 to as high \nas Rs500. A portion of this payment goes toward repayment of the capital cost of the SHS, \nwhile the rest goes to Simpa to cover the costs of operation plus a profit. The higher the \nrecharge amount, the higher the proportion of the amount allocated for repayment of the capital \ncost of the SHS. Once the capital cost of the SHS is recovered (typically after 2\u20133 years), \ncustomers receive a code through a text message to unlock the SHS, after which they are not \nrequired to purchase any further energy credits and own the SHS outright. The pricing plan is \ncompletely flexible and can be customized to suit the customer\u2019s needs and ability to pay. Thus \nongoing energy expenditure is transformed into an asset purchase through Simpa\u2019s innovative \nsolution. \n \n7.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n8.  Simpa has entered into partnership agreements with SHS vendors wherein vendors offer \nSimpa controller-enabled SHSs under the pay-as-you-go scheme to customers who would \notherwise not have considered buying an SHS due to the high upfront cost.  \n \n9.  In addition to SHSs, Simpa offers its metering solution to micro grid developers as an \nextremely flexible metering, customer, and revenue management solution. In this case, the \nmicro grid developers install the Simpa metering units at each household connected to the \nmicro grid and pay Simpa for ongoing revenue management services.. \n \n10.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n11.  Simpa was established in November 2010 by Paul Needham, Jacob Winiecki, and \nMichael Macharg\u2014three accomplished and highly regarded entrepreneurs with proven track \nrecords. Simpa is incorporated in Delaware, United States, and operates in India through its \n100% subsidiary Simpa Energy India.  \n \n12.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n2.  Management \n13.  Simpa\u2019s management team comprises local and foreign professionals with experience in \nsolar finance, energy access, micro-payments, and information technology. The management \nteam is listed in Table 2.3 \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Additional information on the management team and board of directors is presented in Ownership, Management \nand Governance accessible from the List of Linked Documents in Appendix 2.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n18.  The ADB equity investment of up to $2 million in Simpa will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n19.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n21.  Reporting arrangements. Simpa will provide unaudited quarterly financial statements \nand  audited  annual  financial  statements  to  ADB.  ADB  will  monitor  the  investment  using \ninformation from Simpa, investment administration missions, site visits, and the public domain. \nThe  investment  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  its  financial  success  and  operating \n ", "4    \n \nperformance, and on meeting the development objectives. The performance indicators are \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  ADB\u2019s assistance will provide much-needed growth capital to a company, with an \ninnovative pay-as-you-go payment and metering system, to scale up operations \nin India. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s investment will enable the company to raise capital from other private \nequity firms in the next 3 years. \n(iii)  Through ADB\u2019s representation on its board of directors, the company will benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s knowledge in the sector as it scales up operations and develops \nfurther energy delivery solutions, which could be introduced to other DMCs. \n \nE.  Risks \n23.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n24.  Partnerships. Simpa\u2019s ability to develop partnerships with SHS vendors and micro grid \ndevelopers is critical to the successful execution of its business plan. Simpa will need more \nbusiness-to-consumer partners, many of whom are still small and emerging. In the business-to-\nbusiness segment, Simpa\u2019s potential partners are relatively new micro grid developers that are \nalso expanding their operations and are reliant on grants and subsidies.  \n \n25.  System tampering risk. Given that the system is installed at the customer\u2019s house in \nremote rural areas, Simpa will have difficulty conducting regular physical checks to prevent \ntampering. Tampering has the potential to allow the customer to access electricity without \npaying Simpa for the same, resulting in a revenue loss for Simpa.  \n \n26.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n27.  After-sales service. The SHS vendor and the micro grid developer are responsible for \nafter-sales service and maintenance. Typically two site visits per year are included under the \npricing package. However lack of proper follow-up by the SHS vendors could generate a bad \nreputation for the reliability of SHSs, impacting their market penetration. \n \n28.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n29.  Government subsidies for kerosene. India\u2019s total annual kerosene subsidy for lighting \nis estimated to be $2 billion. Despite high levels of kerosene subsidization, SHSs are cost \neffective  options  for  consumers  in  the  long-term  as  evidenced  by  the  successful  pilot  in \nKarnataka. However, further increases in subsidies or more effective policies for subsidized \nkerosene may promote continued usage of kerosene for lighting purposes. Kerosene subsidy is \na highly political subject as a majority of the consumers of kerosene are rural and low income \nhouseholds, a critical voter base for any political party. \n \n30.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n31.  Expansion of conventional transmission grids. Demand for off-grid energy solutions \nmight  decrease  if  rural  consumers  are  connected  to  the  conventional  transmission  grid. ", "  5 \nHowever, state utilities would have difficulty raising the capital for expansion of transmission \ngrids  given  their  poor  finances  and  heavy  reliance  on  subsidies  to  maintain  existing \ntransmission networks. Moreover, given the electricity demand\u2013supply mismatch, rural areas \nwould likely experience intermittent electricity supply even if connected to the grid. \n \n32.  Reach  of  mobile  networks. The reliability and reach of mobile telecommunication \nnetworks in rural areas is crucial for successful implementation of the short messaging service \n(SMS)-enabled metering and payment system. Any disruption in the mobile network could \ncause loss in revenue for Simpa. India has a well-developed mobile telecommunication network \nwith more than 930 million mobile phone users and 14 mobile network operators as of June \n2012. \n \n33.  Competition. Currently, Simpa is the sole provider of an SMS-enabled payment and \nmetering system for SHS and micro grids in India. Future entrants could take market share \naway from Simpa. As the first entrant in the market, Simpa has a strategic advantage through \nestablished relationships with SHS vendors and micro grid developers. Moreover the market for \noff-grid energy access solutions is significant enough to support the profitable operations of \nmultiple players. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n34.  Impact.  The  project  will  contribute  to  increased  access  to  electricity  in  rural  India. \nAlthough not being measured, increased access to electricity will result in improved education, \nhealth,  and  productivity  outcomes.  Access  to  electricity  enables  children  to  study  beyond \nsunset. Replacement of smoky fuels, such as kerosene, with clean solar energy improves air \nquality, thereby improving respiratory health of household members. Access to electricity also \nimproves  productivity  and  contributes  to  increasing  rural  household  incomes.  Successful \nimplementation of the project across India will offer opportunities for replication across DMCs. \nThe investment is also expected to have a positive demonstration effect leading to increased \nprivate equity and venture capital funding for off-grid energy services in India. \n \n35.  Outcome. The project will result in increased access to clean energy for 63,125 new \nhouseholds by 2015, while delivering adequate returns for the private investors. \n \n36.  Outputs. Successful implementation of the project will result in the sale and installation \nof 29,000 new SHSs and 34,125 metering units for solar-powered micro grids by 2014. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n37.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and country strategy. The investment relates to two \ncore  focus  areas\u2014infrastructure  and  environment\u2014under  Strategy  2020,  wherein  ADB  is \ncommitted  to  expand  the  supply  of  energy  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  way.4 The \ninvestment will directly contribute to the outcome of increasing the number of households with \naccess to electricity. The investment is aligned with the India country partnership strategy, \n2009\u20132012, one of the key outcomes of which is increased rural electrification.5 \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "6    \n \n38.  Consistency with the energy policy and Asia solar energy initiative. Access to \nenergy for all is an important pillar of ADB\u2019s Energy Policy. Maximizing access to energy for \neconomic and social development under its Energy for All Initiative is part of ADB\u2019s inclusive \ngrowth strategy. The initiative aims to share knowledge and to identify and scale up successful \nmodels  that  will  bring  energy  to  the  poor  across  Asia.  Within  the  region,  the  initiative  is \nsupporting  the  Energy  for  All  Partnership,  which  aims  to  extend  access  to  energy  to  an \nadditional 100 million people in Asia and the Pacific by 2015. The project is directly aligned with \nADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to help develop, finance, and commission 3,000 \nmegawatts of solar power generation capacity including off-grid projects in DMCs by May 2013. \n \n39.  Consistency with ADB operations. The project strongly complements ADB\u2019s current \nprivate  sector  initiatives  in  solar  energy  in  India.  In  April  2011,  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors \napproved  the  Solar  Power  Generation  Guarantee  Facility,6 which  will  catalyze  commercial \nlending and private investment for smaller solar generation projects (less than 25 megawatts), \nwhile  the  Dahanu  Solar  Power  Project7 (approved  in  November  2011)  and  the  Rajasthan \nConcentrating  Solar  Power  Project8 (approved  in  March  2012)  aim  to  catalyze  private \ninvestment in larger solar generation projects with a capacity greater than 25 megawatts. The \nproposed equity investment extends ADB assistance to off-grid solar energy solutions making \nADB one of the leading financiers of solar power in India. This investment also highlights ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct  approach  to  promoting  private  investment  in  solar  energy  and  its  ability  to \ncustomize based on market needs and associated risks. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n40.  The  investment  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Simpa\u2019s business activities have minimal or \nno  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. Simpa will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities \nlist, exclude all projects that will have adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, and \nensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations and \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The investment documentation will \ninclude appropriate provisions requiring Simpa to comply with national labor laws and take \nspecific  measures  in  relation  to  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.9 \n \n41.  The investment has some potential gender benefits. Women typically bear the main \nresponsibility for caring for the sick, collecting firewood or traveling to buy fuel, maintaining a \nhygienic domestic environment, and bringing up children. The investment is expected to benefit \nwomen as access to clean energy within their homes will enable women to spend more time on \nother productive work. However as the purchase of an SHS is voluntary, the investment is \nclassified as having no gender elements.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.
