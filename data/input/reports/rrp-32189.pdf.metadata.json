The \nProject  will  target  major  fish-landing  areas  and  their  surrounding \ncoastal  communities  in  4  of  PNG\u2019s  14  maritime  provinces.  Fishing \nand employment related to fishing is a major source of income and \nsustenance  for  most  households  in  the  target  communities.  The \nProject  has  two  purposes:  (i)  sustain  the  fishing  industry  in  each \ntarget area with investments to improve the harbor facilities serving \nfishing  vessels,  passenger  boats,  and  local  fish  traders;  and  (ii)  \nfisheries \nimplement  sustainable  management  of \nresources  through  approaches  linking  fishers  and  fish  traders  with \nthe commercial fish marketing chains. The Project will (i) construct a \nlongline  wharf  in  Lae;  (ii)  develop  capacity  of  provincial  and  local \ngovernments and other service providers through community-based \nfisheries  management  programs  in  the  target  areas;  (iii)  provide \nbasic  social  infrastructures  such  as  jetties  and  associated  landing \nfacilities,  and  transit  houses  and  sanitation  aimed  at  the  personal \nsafety of women fish vendors and workers using the harbor facilities; \nand (iv) undertake an HIV/AIDS prevention campaign. \n\nthe  coastal \n\nPNG  has  large  fishery  resources  that  are,  not  only  underpinning  \nrecent growth in the commercial fishery sector, but also provide the \nlivelihood  for  the  coastal  communities  through  subsistence  and \nsmall-scale  fisheries.  The  investment  and  policy  regimes  in  the \nsector  have  improved  in  recent  years  and  the  National  Fisheries \nAuthority (NFA), which is responsible for national fisheries, has been \nstrengthened  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  leaving  it  in  a  much  stronger  position  to  both  manage  and \nmonitor the fisheries of the country. \n\nWhile  the  domestic  tuna  longline  fisheries  have  increased,  and  \nexpanded  the  export  of  fresh  fish  and  other  marine  products,  the \nis  constrained  by  high \ndevelopment  of  small-scale \noperational  costs,  notably  fuel.  Increasing  cash  needs  by  rural \npeople for basic needs like school fees have forced small-scale and \nsubsistence  fishers  to  primarily  target  high-value  species  such  as \nsea  cucumber  (beche-de-mer)  and  trochus  shells.  Consequently, \nmany of these stocks are now overfished and few alternative income \nopportunities are left.  \n\nfisheries \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfisheries  have  developed  most  of \n\nAs  commercial \nthe  basic \ninfrastructure  and  related  services  needed  to  access  the  more \nlucrative  domestic  and  overseas  markets, \nlinking  small-scale \nfisheries to these centers can provide the basis for an economically \nviable small-scale fishery. This can be achieved by providing small-\nscale  infrastructure  such  as  jetties  at  or  near  commercial  centers, \nthus  creating  the  opportunities  to  obtain  higher  prices  by  exporting \nquality  marine  products  to  larger  domestic  cities  and  overseas.  At \nthe same time, there is a need to stabilize exploitation at sustainable \nlevels and reverse the decline in some fisheries. Provincial and local \nadministrations,  which  are  largely  responsible  for  coastal  resource \nmanagement,  require  appropriate  skills,  systems,  and  resources  to \ncarry out this task in partnership with local communities. \n\nLack  of  basic  social  amenities,  a  general  lack  of  safety,  and \ndeclining  law  and  order  in  many  coastal  cities  are  issues  that \nnegatively affect women, who dominate small-scale fish trading and \nprocessing. Improved social infrastructure, including places to sleep, \nsanitation,  and  safety,  must  also  be  addressed  if  sustainability  of \ncoastal fisheries is to be achieved.   \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas  by \nincreasing,  or  preventing  further  decline  of,  income  of  coastal \ncommunities. This will be done by promoting improved management \nof  resources  (including  in  those  area  currently  overfished,  or \nthreatened with overfishing) and by creating sustainable earning and \nemployment  opportunities  for  coastal  fishers  by  providing  links  to \nestablished commercial fishing centers.  \n\nThe Project will be undertaken in four selected provinces (Milne Bay, \nMorobe,  New  Ireland,  and  Western),  each  of  which  possesses  a \nfavorable  blend  of  conditions,  namely:  availability  of  supporting \ninfrastructure,  relative  abundance  of  fish  resources,  potential  for \nincreased  value \nto \ncommercial fishery centers. The Project has four main components: \n\nfishery,  and  proximity \n\nfrom  small-scale \n\nFisheries  Management  Support.  Strengthen \nthe \ncapacity  of  fishery  stakeholders  and/or  service  providers \nat  provincial  levels  to  plan  and  implement,  provide \nappropriate information flows, improve the organization of \nfishery  stakeholders, \nresearch \ninitiatives,  promote  comanagement  of  marine  resources, \nand undertake awareness training programs in HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  The  Project  will  also  provide  support  to \ninitiatives in other provinces, if required. \n\nincrease  necessary \n\nLongline  wharf.  Extend  the  longline  wharf  in  Lae  to \ncomplement the ongoing investment by the private sector, \nand  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  small-\nscale fishing operations. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSocial  infrastructure.

The \nsteering  committee  will  comprise  members \nthe \ncommercial  fisheries  sector,  Department  of  National  Planning  and \nMonitoring,  Department  of  Provincial  Affairs,  the  Treasury,  PNG \nHarbours Board, and other fishery stakeholders as appropriate. \n\nfrom  NFA, \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  procurement  financed  by  the  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.

For civil works contracts below this \namount, local competitive bidding procedures will be applied. \n\nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  224  person-months  of  consulting \nservices,  comprising  115  person-months  of  international  and  109 \nperson-months of domestic services. All consultants will be recruited \nby  NFA,  under  the  quality  and  cost  based  selection  method  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  ADB  approved  advance \naction for the selection of consultants. \n \nDirect, quantifiable benefits include (i) increased catch value of fish \nand other marine products; (ii) time and cost savings from improved \nfish-landing  access;  and  (iii)  increased  marketing  opportunities  for \nsmall boat operators, and fish and marine product vendors using the \nharbor  facilities.  Fishers  will  benefit  directly  from  the  improved \naccess to the markets, additional fishing time from time savings due \nto improved jetty and road facilities, and increased sales value from \navoidance of contamination of fish. Nonquantifiable benefits include \nsustaining  the  productivity  of  local  fisheries,  and  improved  health \nand personal safety due to the HIV/AIDS prevention measures and \nprovision of toilets and overnight shelters in the harbor areas.   \n\nThe beneficiaries include commercial tuna-fishing vessel owners and \nworkers,  small-scale  operators,  subsistence  fishers,  and  artisanal \nfishers  engaged  in  production  and  marketing  of  fish  and  marine \nproducts.  Women  who  constitute  the  majority  of  fish  processors, \nvendors,  and  market  stallholders  will  benefit  directly  from  the \nProject\u2019s  economic  impact  as  well  as  from  improved  health  and \npersonal safety measures due to the HIV/AIDS prevention measures \nand  the  improved  sanitation  and  shelters  provided.  The  project \nbeneficiaries  will  total  about  150,000  people  (30,000  households) \nfrom  the  target  coastal  communities  where  poverty  incidence  is \ngenerally equal to, or above, the incidence of poverty in rural areas, \n41%, which is higher than the national poverty incidence of 37%. \n\nProjects in PNG face many risks, especially poor transparency and \naccountability  in  public  administration,  which  is  well  documented. \nPolitical instability and shifting policies also tend to dampen investor \nconfidence.  However,  with  respect  to  NFA,  its  new  structure  has \nmade  it  much  more  resilient  to  outside  political  pressure  and \ninterference.  Another  risk  is  the  issue  of  the  marine  tenure  system, \nwhich is ill defined. Certain Project activities require collaboration by \ncommunities  across  traditional  marine  tenure  boundaries,  and  any \nimplementation will need prior consultations and written agreement. \nA  major  assumption  is  that  provincial  authorities  and  staff  are \nprepared and willing to see more influence in decision making being \nvested with communities and other stakeholders.    \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a \nproposed  loan  to  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Coastal \nFisheries Management and Development Project. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND \nOPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nCommercial fisheries in PNG have performed well in recent years. Exports have \n2. \ngrown  significantly  both  in  volume  and  value  (from  1,500  metric  tons  (t)  worth  K13.1 \nmillion  in  1995,  to  48,000  t  worth  K159.7  million  in  2000).1  In  the  past  3  years  license \nand  access  fee  revenues  have  increased  by  a  factor  of  more  than  five,  from  about  K5 \nmillion in 1999 to an estimated K28.3 million in 2001.2  \n \n3. \nThe  steadily  improving  performance  of  the  sector  can  be  attributed  to  several \nfactors. Fishery management policy changes have removed bureaucratic obstacles that \npreviously  hampered  the  activities  of  domestic  operators  and  discouraged  foreign \ninvestors.  Institutional  and  management  improvements  within  the  National  Fisheries \nAuthority  (NFA),  which  is  responsible  for  management  of  the  nation\u2019s  fisheries,  have \nmade negotiation and collection of fishery access and license fees more efficient. At the \nsame time the progressive decline of the kina, relative to other currencies, has increased \nthe  international  competitiveness  of  PNG\u2019s  export  fisheries.  As  a  result,  the  size  of  the \ndomestic  and  locally  based  fishing  fleets  has  grown  (the  domestic  longline  fleet  has \ngrown from 9 to 47 vessels, and about 14 purse seiners are now locally based), onshore \nprocessing  plants  have  been  established  (a  tuna  cannery  in  Madang  and  a  mackerel \ncannery in Lae, and plans are well-advanced for tuna-loining plants in Lae and Wewak). \nAlso  a  wider  range  of  seafoods,  including  value-added  products  such  as  canned  tuna \nand mackerel, are being exported by domestic operators.  \n \n4. \nSupply by local commercial fishing operations to PNG\u2019s domestic markets is also \nincreasing.  By-catch  from  the  fresh  tuna  longline  industry  is  progressively  supplanting \nimported canned and frozen fish products, which are becoming increasingly expensive in \nkina  terms.  Seafood  imports  were  estimated  to  be  56,000  t  in  1990,  35,539  t  in  1995, \nand 13,473 t in 1998.3 \n \n5. \nMost  analysts  predict  that  the  kina  is  unlikely  to  return  to  its  former  high  value. \nThe  effect  of  a  weak  kina  increases  the  relative  cost  of  imported  inputs  to  the  fishing \nindustry, especially fuel, but also generates greater revenues from export product sales \ngiven price-elastic export demand, as well as improving product competitiveness on the \ndomestic market. Economic conditions thus appear favorable for the continued growth of \n\n                                                 \n1   1995  data  is  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  PNG  Fishery  Country \nProfile. 2000 data is from the PNG National Fisheries Authority export database, and is known to be an \nunderestimate because of undeclared exports. \n\n2   National Fisheries Authority financial data. \n3   1990  data  is  from  NFA  (1996),  1995  data  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization\u2019s  PNG  Fishery \n\nCountry Profile, 1998 data is unpublished information provided by the PNG Customs Department. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nPNG\u2019s  commercial  fisheries,  supported  by  an  improved  policy  and  management \nenvironment. \n \n6. \nMuch  of  the  sector\u2019s  growth  to  date  has  been  assisted  or  mediated  by  ADB\u2019s \nFisheries Development Project (FDP).4 The FDP commenced in mid-1999 and has led to \nmany  of  the  policy  changes  referred  to.  The  FDP  has  also  led  to  institutional \nimprovements in NFA, which has become a smaller, more productive, and more focused \nagency  with  a  clear  role  and  mandate,  and  much  better  delivery  capabilities.5    The \nprivate  fishing  industry,  small-scale  fishers,  resource  owners,  provinces,  and  the \nGovernment now have greater confidence in NFA. The success and positive impacts of \nthe FDP are part of the reason why the present Project, which is a natural follow-on from \nthe  FDP,  is  strongly  desired  and  supported  by  the  Government  and  by  the  fishery \nstakeholders. \n \n7. \nIn  mid-2000  the  Government  of  PNG  approached  ADB  for  a  loan  to  finance \ninitiatives  aimed  at  enhancing  small-scale  fisheries  development  in  rural  areas  of  the \ncountry.  Loan  fact-finding  took  place  during  26  October\u20134  November  2001  and  the \nobjectives,  scope,  and  cost  estimates  were  agreed  with  the  Government  in  a \nmemorandum of understanding signed on 1 November 2001.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Opportunities \n\nDespite  the  encouraging  recent  growth  of  commercial  fishing  activities,  barriers \n8. \nto  continuing  growth  remain.  One  of  the  most  important  is  the  lack  of  infrastructure  to \nenable the efficient transfer of products from areas of resource abundance\u2014which may \nbe remote\u2014to local and overseas market outlets. Infrastructure encompasses a range of \nfacilities:  wharves,  jetties,  roads,  fuel  depots  and  utilities,  ice-making  machinery, \nrefrigeration  plants,  processing  shops  and  factories,  and  transportation,  especially  air \nfreight  for  highly  perishable  fresh  and  chilled  seafood  products.  At  present,  only  Port \nMoresby  and  Lae  have  sufficient  wharf  space,  engineering  services,  and  transport \ninfrastructure to make them attractive as bases for the commercial fishing fleet. Facilities \nat  both  these  locations  are  now  becoming  overcrowded  and  overstretched  to  the  point \nthat future fleet growth is seriously constrained. Expansion of the infrastructure available \nin  these  locations,  and/or  development  of  new  facilities  in  other  locations  is  urgently \nneeded. \n \n9. \nSome  of  the  infrastructure  needed  by  the  commercial  fishing  industry  can  and \nshould  be  provided  by  the  industry  itself,  or  by  other  parts  of  the  private  sector.  This \nincludes  ice  and  refrigeration,  processing  facilities,6  engineering  services,  fuel,  and \ntransportation.  In  the  case  of  wharves,  jetties,  roads,  and  utilities,  however,  the  scale \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan \n\nto Papua New Guinea for the Fisheries Development Project. Manila. \n\n5   See Supplementary Appendix A for details on organization, responsibilities, staffing, and mandate of NFA. \n6   In the past, the Government was, mistakenly, involved in the establishment and operation of this kind of \ninfrastructure, with disastrous results. The Government has demonstrated very comprehensively that it is \nnot able to run commercial operations effectively because social objectives get mingled with commercial \nobligations. The result of Government intervention in commercial fishing has been the loss of significant \namounts of public funds through subsidy of unprofitable ventures, stifling of private sector development, \nand now, large numbers of government fisheries centers rusting away in various coastal locations around \nPNG. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nand scope of the required interventions are beyond the capacity of the private sector. In \nparticular,  the  issue  of  obtaining  land  rights  or  titles  is  extremely  difficult  in  PNG,  as \nalmost  all  land  is  owned  by  clans  or  clusters  of  clans  based  on  user  rights;  title  deeds \noften do not exist. In addition, private sector entities that manage to get a land lease for \na  specific  purpose  run  the  risk  of  \u201crenegotiation\u201d  if  the  landowners  find  the  business \nmore  profitable  than  expected  during  the  first  negotiations.  Given  such  constraints, \npublic sector intervention is warranted to correct these nonmarket failures.  Standardized \nharbor  charges  are  already  in  place  throughout  PNG  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance costs (O&M). Wharf or jetty infrastructure owned by NFA is being leased to \nprivate  sector  operators  with  clear  stipulations  of  obligations,  rights,  and  appropriate \nfees. \n \nUnlike  the  commercial  sector,  PNG\u2019s  artisanal  or  small-scale  fisheries  are  not \n10. \nflourishing. In fact, many are struggling for economic survival. Most artisanal vessels are \nsmall  and  not  fuel  efficient  (usually  outboard-powered  skiffs  known  as  banana  boats), \nand the increasing cost of fuel (which in kina terms has tripled in the last 3 years) is a \nmajor burden. In general, small-scale fishers live in poor rural areas where resources are \nrelatively  abundant,  but  where  the  local  market  value  of  seafood,  such  as  fruit, \nvegetables,  and  other  garden  produce,  has  not  increased  by  anything  like  the  price  of \nfuel. Rural small-scale producers of these products now find it difficult or impossible to \ncover the cost of transporting their produce to market. The problem is particularly acute \nfor  fishing,  which  requires  a  much  greater  input  of  fuel  than  does  marketing  garden \nproduce. However, as most rural dwellers are multioccupational, being involved in both \nfishing and gardening, few are unaffected by the increasing cost of fuel. \n \n11. \nSome  small-scale  fishers  catch  products  such  as  lobsters  and  sea  cucumbers, \nthe  latter  being  processed  to  beche-de-mer  (dried  sea-cucumber),  to  sell  to  traders  or \nand/or exporters. Because of the declining value of the kina, these products are retaining \nor  increasing  their  value,  and  are  thus  increasingly  being  targeted.  This  has  led  to \noverexploitation  in  some  areas,  particularly  for  sea  cucumbers,  which  are  valuable, \nrelatively  easy  to  catch,  and  do  not  require  refrigeration  when  processed.  (The  same \nmay apply to trochus and other mother-of-pearl shells, although currently information on \nlandings  and  exports  of  these  products  is  insufficient).  The  net  result  is  that  these \nvaluable export commodities are now overfished, while the supply of fresh fish and other \nseafood by artisanal fishers to local markets is in decline. \n \nThe  solution  to  this  problem  lies  partly  in  providing  small-scale  fishers  with \n12. \nimproved  access  to  more  profitable,  export-oriented  markets  for  fresh  fish  and  other \nmarine resources. If artisanal fishers could catch high-value products such as sashimi-\ngrade tuna, deep-water snappers, live lobsters, etc., for the export markets, the value of \nsuch  products  would  be  many  times  what  it  is  on  local  markets,  and  it  would  again \nbecome  profitable  for  small-scale  fishers  to  target  such  resources,  which  are  still \nabundant  and  not  overfished.  Even  urban  markets  within  PNG,  such  as  those  in  Port \nMoresby  and  Lae,  pay  far  higher  prices  for  fish  and  seafood  than  can  be  obtained  in \nlocal markets in rural areas.  \n \n13. \nToday, the Government\u2019s policy is to recognize the private sector as the engine \nof  commercial  growth  and  to  provide  it  with  basic  infrastructure,  coupled  with  a  policy \nand regulatory environment in which it can flourish and provide market opportunities to \nrural  producers.  In  line  with  this  approach,  NFA  has  adopted  a  policy  for  the  fishery \nsector of encouraging commercial seafood exporters to purchase products from artisanal \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nproducers.  This  approach  already  works  well  in  the  beche-de-mer,  shell,  barramundi, \nand  Torres  Strait  lobster  fisheries,  and  will  be  extended  to  other  fishery  products.  By \npromoting the development of a wharf and social infrastructure for the fishery sector in \nspecific  areas  where  the  conditions  are  most  favorable,  NFA  aims  to  help  the \ncommercial  trade  grow  in  those  areas,  thereby  creating  new  market  opportunities  for \nartisanal  fishers.  Lessons  learned  clearly  tell  us  that  the  development  of  small-scale \nfisheries  requires  marketing  links  to  the  growing  commercial  sector,  as  the  highly \nfluctuating artisanal product volumes involved can never justify the cost of building and \noperating infrastructure exclusively for small-scale fishers. This policy is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2002\u20132004) for PNG. \n \n14. \nGrant funding from the European Union and Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment  is  now  being  channeled  to  programs  for  information  and  training  that  will \nhelp  small-scale  fishers  understand  market  and  food  safety  requirements,  learn  basic \nbusiness skills, and catch/process the type and quality of products that will best satisfy \nmarket demand. As of 2002, aid funds7 will also be used to provide loans or finance hire-\npurchase schemes that will assist artisanal fishers to acquire larger, more fuel-efficient, \nand  commercially  viable  vessels,  leading  to  a  progressive  improvement  of  small-scale \nfishing operations. However, the introduction of more appropriate vessels into the small-\nscale  fishing  fleet  will  be  impeded  unless  there  are  parallel  developments  in  rural \ninfrastructure, especially wharves and jetties, which will permit their use. \n \n15. \nOn  the  other  hand,  to  prevent  overfishing  and  ensure  that  all  potential  target \nspecies can be sustainably harvested, appropriate fisheries management plans need to \nbe developed. These need to be based on an improved understanding of the capacity of \nspecific  resources  to  support  new  or  existing  fisheries,  and  a  clearer  understanding  of \nhow  these  resources  respond  to  changes  in  level  of  exploitation.  Better  information  on \nthe  degree  to  which  fishery  resources  are  being  exploited  is  also  needed,  based  on  \nimproved  monitoring  of  fishery  activities  and  harvests.  Resource  management  and \navoidance of overexploitation are clearly areas where public intervention can be made to \nremedy market failure (A review of the sector is in Supplementary Appendix A.). \n \n16.  Management  of  all  PNG\u2019s  fisheries  is  the  responsibility  of  NFA.  However,  NFA \nrecognizes  that  it  has  neither  the  statutory  role  nor  the  comparative  advantage  to \nundertake  extensive  provincial  and  local  interventions.  Larger-scale  commercial  fishery \nmanagement is achieved through liaison between NFA and industry, and by monitoring \nand  policing  a  relatively  small  number  of  vessels  and  businesses.  However  for  small-\nscale  fisheries,  involving  thousands  of  participants  dispersed  over  huge  and  often \nremote  areas,  management  is  impossible  without  the  active  participation  of  provincial \ngovernments, communities, resource users, resource owners, and a wide range of other \nstakeholders  in  the  sector.  Therefore,  NFA  is  keen  to  promote  partnerships  with \nprovincial  and  local  governments,  and/or  other  service  providers  that  will  allow  these \nstakeholders to participate more fully in the management process. Recent improvements \nin  NFA\u2019s  organizational  and  financial  arrangements  now  allow  NFA  to  mobilize  its  own \nfinancial and human resources in support of such initiatives. \n \n17. \nAt  present,  management  capacity  for  fisheries  or  understanding  of  fisheries \nissues  is  extremely  limited  outside  of  NFA  and  the  commercial  industry.  For \nmanagement  of  small-scale  fisheries  to  be  possible,  an  effective  consultative  process \n\n                                                 \n7   Rural Coastal Fisheries Development Project funded by the European Union. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nbetween NFA and provincial service providers, covering (i) information dissemination, (ii) \nawareness building, and (iii) training and capacity building, is needed. Such a program \nwould  need  to  be  run  by  NFA  and  anticipates  the  active  participation  of  all  levels  of \nprovincial  administration,  nongovernment  organizations,  fisher  associations,  church \ngroups, industry, and other development partners. \n  \n18. \nAttempting  to  immediately  implement  such  activities  nationwide  would  be \nunrealistic.  A  better  option  would  be  to  gradually  begin  in  a  selected  number  of  sites \nwhere  management  issues  are,  or  are  expected  to  become,  a  constraint,  and  at  the \nsame time where sufficient will exists in the industry, the provincial governments, and/or \namong  the  fishery  stakeholders.  With  a  small  number  of  successful  site-based \ninterventions  to  serve  as  demonstrations,  a  program  could  then  be  progressively \nextended to other areas depending on the need, interest, and resources available. \n \n19.  Weak  institutions  in  the  fishery  sector  impose  a  disproportionate  burden  on \nwomen.  The  low  social  status  of  women  in  general,  coupled  with  unsafe  conditions  in \nmany  coastal  markets,  where  law  and  order  are  difficult  to  enforce,  make  this  group \nparticularly  vulnerable.  It  is  generally  the  responsibility  of  women  to  bring  seafood \nproduce to the markets to sell. With profit margins low due to high fuel prices, the added \ntime spent in congested and overcrowded landing places make sale of the produce and \nreturn  home  within  one  day  very  difficult.  Whenever  overnight  stays  are  necessary, \nlodging  expenses  cut  even  further  into  the  already  low  profit,  and  many  women  thus \nchoose  to  sleep  wherever  they  can.  In  areas  with  no  facilities  like  public  toilets  or \nmeeting places, women face a real risk of being sexually abused when using the beach \nas  a  toilet  after  dark,  or  of  being  sexually  exploited  as  payment  for  \u201cprotection\u201d  of \nthemselves and their unsold produce while they sleep. Human immunodefficiency virus \n(HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are relatively new  in PNG but \nare  spreading  with  alarming  speed.  So  far  nearly  5,000  people  in  PNG  have  been \nreported  as  having  HIV/AIDS  infection,  but  the  actual  number  is  estimated  to  be  three \ntimes  higher.  Because  of  high  mobility  and  frequent  overnight  stays  away  from  home, \nfisher groups are among those identified as \u201chigh-risk.\u201d  \n \nTo  assist  in  mitigating  these  conditions,  this  Project  will  construct  necessary \n20. \nfacilities:  (i)  small  jetties  for  better  access  and  reduced  turnaround  time,  (ii)  public \nshelters  for  women  traders,  (iii)  public  toilets,  and  (iv)  improved  landing  areas;  and  \nconduct targeted HIV/AIDS campaigns. Through these interventions, society as a whole \nbenefits and the risk of potentially catastrophic social consequences is reduced. \n \n21. \nThe Project provides an integrated response to these issues. It capitalizes on the \nopportunities  and  addresses  the  constraints  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the \ndevelopment strategies of the Government, takes full account of the lessons learned in \nprevious fishery sector interventions, and complements the activities and plans of other \ndevelopment partners (especially AusAID and the EU) working in PNG\u2019s fisheries sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n22. \nThe  history  of  past  interventions  for  small-scale  fishers  is  not  particularly \nencouraging. The main lessons learned from past projects in PNG can be summarized \nas follows: (i) avoid overestimating implementation capacity, (ii) involve beneficiaries in \nproject design, (iii) be more flexible regarding project scope, (iv) keep project objectives \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nsimple, (v) clearly separate government and private sector responsibilities, and (vi) avoid \nnew or unproven technology.  \n \n23. \nAll  six  recommendations  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The \nlimited number of selected provinces and the different development packages offered in \neach  will  enable  NFA  to  gradually  implement  the  Project  with  maximum  efficiency. \nFurthermore,  extensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  carried  out  during  the  project \npreparation  phase  and  the  interventions  proposed  had  the  broadest  consensus.  The \nproject  scope  takes  into  consideration  a  range  of  options  to  achieve  sustainable \nmanagement  of  the  marine  resources\u2014there  is  no  \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d  approach.  A \nfundamental principle, when proposing various infrastructure, has been that  the private \nsector, and not NFA, should be responsible for their management. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n24. \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  in  rural  areas  of  PNG  by \nincreasing,  or  preventing  further  declines  of,  the  income  of  coastal  communities.  The \nproject  objective  will  be  achieved  by  improving  the  capacity  of  fishery  stakeholders  to \nmanage coastal fisheries in a way that maximizes long-term sustainable benefits, and by \ncreating earning and employment opportunities for coastal fishers through infrastructure \ndevelopment and market access. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n25. \n \n\nThe Project has four main components: \n\nFisheries management support. Undertake basic resource surveys and \ninvestigations,  and  enhance  NFA  research  facilities,  to  permit  the \ndevelopment  of \nfishery \nmanagement  capabilities  of  the  most  efficient  service  providers  in  the \nselected  provinces;  improve  the  organization  of  fishery  stakeholders;  and \npromote comanagement of resources. \n\nfishery  management  plans;  strengthen \n\nthe \n\nLongline wharf.  Establish the coastal infrastructure needed to promote \ndevelopment  and  investment  by  the  commercial  fishery  sector,  thus \nstrengthening the access to domestic and overseas markets. \n\nSocial infrastructure. Establish jetty facilities to provide appropriate and \nimproved  access  to  market  outlets;  provide  safe  shelter  and  sanitation, \nparticularly for women; and improve the business opportunities for small-\nscale fishers. \n\nProject  management.  Provide  project  supervision,  accounting  and \ntender  documents,  and  general  project \nreporting,  preparation  of \nadministration and backstopping.  \n\n \n26. \nSmall-scale  fishery  development  cannot  take  place  in  isolation  from  the \ncommercial  fishing  industry,  which  in  general  has  the  necessary  infrastructure  for \nprocessing  and  marketing.  Thus,  during  project  design,  the  most  appropriate  locations \nwere selected based on a range of factors, i.e., availability of supporting infrastructure, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nrelative abundance of fish resources, potential for increased value from the small-scale \nfishery, and proximity to commercial fishery centers. \n  \n27. \nInterventions  under  the  Project  therefore  focus  on  four  selected  provinces  that \nsatisfy  the  above  criteria:  Milne  Bay  (fisheries  management  support  and  social \ninfrastructure),  Morobe  (fisheries  management  support,  longline  wharf,  and  social \ninfrastructure),  New  Ireland  (fisheries  management  support),  and  Western  (social \ninfrastructure).  The  selected  provinces  have  different  degrees  of  established \ninfrastructure  and  different  absorptive  development  capacities,  hence  a  different \ndevelopment  package  will  be  provided  to  each.  Broader  benefits  will  result,  both \nnationally  and  to  other  provinces,  particularly  from  activities  under  the  fisheries \nmanagement  support  component.  (A  detailed  description  of  the  fisheries  management \nsupport  component  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  A  detailed  description  of  the \nlongline wharf and the social infrastructure is in Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nFisheries Management Support \n\n28. \nThe  Project  has  a  relatively  high  input  of  consulting  services;  many  of  the \nproposed activities are process-oriented, aimed at capacity-building, awareness-raising, \nand  consensus-building  at  provincial  and  local  levels,  with  the  desired  outcome  being \nthe effective implementation of action plans, rules and management systems in the four \nprovinces. \n   \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening for Coastal Fisheries Management \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  and  improve  fishery  management  and  development \ncapacity  and  procedures  at  provincial  and  local  levels  through  (i)  establishment  of \nconsultative  processes  between  NFA  and  provincial  service  providers  to  plan  and \nimplement  business  development,  identify  and  address  training  needs,  and  establish \nnecessary  information  flows;  (ii)  human  resource  development,  mainly  through  short-\nterm  training  of  fishery  stakeholders  in  biological  and  economic  principles  of  fishery \nmanagement; (iii) drafting of fisheries legislation to establish the legal basis for working \nand  financial  relationships  between  NFA  and  provincial  and  local  bodies,  and  to  give \neffect to local fisheries management rules; (iv) promotion of the formation of stakeholder \nassociations  and  other  formal  groupings  to  empower  stakeholders  and  enable  them  to \ndemand  greater  government    accountability;  (v)  establishment  of  provincial  fishery \nadvisory  committees  to  provide  a  mechanism  whereby  stakeholders  can  participate  in \nthe  fishery  management  decision-making  process;  and  (vi)  establishment  of  pragmatic \nand  achievable  provincial  fishery  action  plans  based  on  assessments  of  resource \npotential, economic characteristics, and public and private sector capabilities. \n \n30. \nThe overall output from this subcomponent will thus be a marked improvement in \nthe capacity of provincial service providers to participate effectively in the management \nof  fishery  and  coastal  marine  resource  use.  During  project  implementation,  NFA  will \nprogressively  develop  arrangements  to  ensure  that  funding  of  provincial  management \narrangements is sustained after project completion. Options will vary from one location \nto another and include funding of management arrangements from license fees collected \nby  NFA,  development  of  local  licensing  systems  to  be  implemented  by  provinces  or \nother  management  partners,  use  of  existing  provincial  or  other  government  budget \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nallocations,  industry  cost-recovery  arrangements,  or  other  methods.  The  result  will  be \nthat  specific  fishery  development  and  management  initiatives  will  be  more  appropriate, \nbetter targeted, better resourced, and have vastly higher prospects of success. \n \n\nb. \n\nCoastal Fisheries Assessment and Monitoring \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  assessment  of  fishery  resource  potential  in  PNG \nthrough  (i)  resource  inventories\u2014collating  the  existing  body  of  widely  scattered \ninformation on fishery resources in a form that is usable at the provincial level; (ii) habitat \nmapping  using  remote-sensing  information  and  establishment  of  provincial  marine \nresource  geographic  information  systems;  (iii)  field  surveys  of  marine  resources  and \nhabitats  to  gather  fishery-independent  information  on  the  extent  and  condition  of  key \nresources;  (iv)  longer-term  research  projects  and  studies  aimed  at  elucidating  basic \nbiological  characteristics  and  population  parameters  of  key  inshore  resources,  to  be \ncarried  out  mainly  from  NFA\u2019s  Nago  Island  research  station  (whose  facilities  will  be \nenhanced for this purpose); and (v) household surveys to obtain information on levels of \nseafood catch and consumption, and on fishing patterns, practices, and knowledge. \n \n32. \nThese various activities will provide objective information on the resource base in \nthe target provinces that can be used for planning purposes, and will serve as a baseline \nagainst  which  future  surveys  can  be  carried  out  to  measure  changes  or  assess  the \nimpact of development and management initiatives. \n \n\nc. \n\nStrengthening Information Flows  \n\nfor  government  decision  makers, \n\n33. \nInformation dissemination will be strengthened by the Project through (i) collation \nof  key  reports  and  information  on  PNG  fisheries  to  be  catalogued  and  converted  to \nelectronic  format  for  easy  storage  and  distribution;  (ii)  production  of  concise,  usable \ntrade  and \nfishery  resource  profiles  designed \ninvestment promotion agencies, entrepreneurs, resource owners, and others who need \nto  have  a  realistic  understanding  of  fishery  development  opportunities  and  limitations; \n(iii)  production  of  information  and  awareness  materials  needed  by  fishery  stakeholders \nor  that  need  to  be  promulgated  by  agencies  concerned  with  fishery  management \n(including public information and educational products for schools); (iv) establishment of \nprovincial \nfisheries \nmanagement  and  general  development  planning;  and  (v)  establishment  of  a  PNG \nfisheries  web  site  through  which  documents,  statistics,  and  other  information  on  PNG \nfisheries can be made available to stakeholders. \n \n34. \nThese  activities  will  complement  and  enhance  those  already  beginning  to  be \ncarried  out  by  NFA  nationally,  and  together  will  make  factual  information  on  PNG \nfisheries  and  marine  resources  readily  available  to  fishery  managers,  planners,  NGOs, \ndevelopment agencies, and the private sector. \n \n\nfishery  statistics  and  data  collection  programs \n\nto  assist \n\nin \n\nd. \n\nCommunity-Based Fisheries Development and Management \n\n35. \nThe  Project  will  implement  effective  community-based  management  of  local  or \nsmall-scale  fisheries  at  provincial  levels  through  (i)  awareness-raising,  primarily  with \nlocal  NGOs,  among  coastal  communities  on  the  short-term  costs  and  longer-term \nbenefits  of  marine  resource  management;  (ii)  deployment  of  fish-attracting-devices, \nwhich will be used in selected cases as incentives to encourage adoption of community \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nin \n\nto \n\nimprove  awareness  and  secure  participation \n\nmanagement  arrangements  or  the  formation  of  stakeholder  associations;  (iii)  juvenile \ntrochus-shell  releases \nlocal \nmanagement initiatives by coastal communities; (iv) small business promotion including \ntraining;  (v)  women\u2019s  skills  training  on  fish  quality,  marketing,  value-added  processing, \nand business management; and (vi) development of training and peer-to-peer education \nprograms  on  HIV/AIDS  specifically  for  the  fisheries  sector  to  increase  awareness  and \nreduce  risk-taking  behavior  in  regard  to  sexual  hygiene  and  sexually  transmitted \ninfections. \n \n36. \nThe Project will carry out a targeted HIV/AIDS training and awareness campaign, \ndirected at the fishing industry and associated processing industries. The campaign will \nbe  conducted  through  vocational  training  programs  at  the  National  Fisheries  College, \nsensitization  programs  for  fishing  business  managers  and  the  private  sector,  and  peer \neducation programs to be carried out in the workplace and in coastal communities. The \ncampaign  will  aim  to  raise  understanding  and  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  minimize \nrisk-taking  behavior  within  the  industry  in  regard  to  sexual  hygiene  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  This  approach  is  in  line  with  national  policies  on  HIV/AIDS \nawareness.8  It  is  limited  in  scope  because  the  policy  states  that  national  programs \nshould cover general awareness of HIV/AIDS. However, the Government acknowledges \nthat it does not have the resources to initiate widespread workplace programs targeted \nat specific groups. \n \n37. \nOnce  training  programs  and  materials  are  developed  for  the  National  Fisheries \nCollege, their delivery can continue on a routine basis without the need for further inputs \nby  the  Project.  As  regards  the  private  sector,  long-term  implementation  of  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and behavior change programs in the fishing industry will ultimately need to \nbecome  the  responsibility  of  the  companies  themselves.  Fishing  businesses  will  be \nencouraged  to  integrate  the  awareness  and  behavioral  change  program  into  their  own \ntraining  and  staff  development  programs.  Business  operators  have  indicated  a \nwillingness to cooperate in this regard, as they perceive it as a means of protecting the \ninvestment they have made in their workforce. \n \n\ne. \n\nMariculture Development \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  finance  improvements  to  the  facilities  at  NFA\u2019s  Nago  Island \nresearch  station  to  allow  NFA  to  develop  an  experimental  aquaculture  capability. \nImprovements to be financed under the Project are the conversion of an existing building \nand the provision of equipment necessary to permit aquaculture activities, as well as the \nstrengthening  of  an  existing  small  jetty  to  improve  boat  access.  These  enhancements \nwill permit the station to produce the trochus shells needed for juvenile release activities \n(para.  35).  They  will  also  enable  NFA  to  proceed  with  a  number  of  other  experimental \naquaculture  activities  (pearl  oyster  hatchery,  experimental  capture  and  ongrowing  of \njuvenile  ornamental  fish,  and  beche-de-mer  culture  for  restocking  experiments),  which \nover  the  longer  term  are  expected  to  lead  to  improved  marine  resource  management \nand the creation of small-scale, income-generating opportunities. \n \n39. \nCollectively, these activities will create increased income opportunities for small-\nscale  fishers  and  fish  processors  by  promoting  sustainable  commercial  development \nactivities,  and  by  introducing  management  concepts  and  arrangements  that,  over  the \n\n                                                 \n8    PNG National Aids Council. 1998. HIV/AIDS Medium Term Plan. Port Moresby.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nlong  term  will  allow  the  maximization  of  sustainable  benefits  from  inshore  marine \nresources. \n \n\n2. \n\nLongline Wharf \n\n40. \nThe  proposed  intervention,  which  is  described  in  more  detail  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  C,  is  relatively  small  in  scale  and  cost,  but  promises  to  provide  significant \nreturns  and  benefits  for  the  small-scale  fishers  in  their  respective  catchment  areas  as \nwell as for larger commercial operators. NFA has introduced the practice of leasing the \nmanagement  of  the  facilities  it  owns  to  the  private  sector.  Such  lease  agreements \ninclude  obligations  for  public  access,  collection  of    wharfage  fees  to  cover  O&M  costs, \nand general provision of basic services.  \n \n41. \nInputs required for the capital investment are primarily engineering services and \nmaterials. No special features are included in the proposed wharf component and it will \nbe  constructed  within  an  already  developed  harbor  area.  The  proposed  wharf  will  be \nconstructed on piles to ensure maximum water exchange and in conformity with already \nproven technology in PNG.  \n \n42. \nThe  new  tuna  longline  wharf  will  remove  a  constraint  that  is  impeding  the \ndevelopment of the commercial tuna longline fleet in Lae. Currently about eight vessels \nare  operating  from  Lae,  and  lack  of  facilities  is  preventing  the  basing  of  additional \nvessels. Expansion of Voco Point wharf facilities will allow up to three longliners to tie up \nalongside  and  unload  their  catch  at  any  one  time,  compared  with  the  present  situation \nwhen  only  one  vessel  can  tie  up  to  the  fishing  wharf.  Space  requirements  for  turning \nvessels  at  the  adjacent  wharf,  which  is  owned  by  the  Lutheran  Shipping  Service,  will \nnecessitate construction of the new wharf as far to the west as possible. This will mean \nthat  only  one  side  of  the  wharf  can  be  used  for  longliners,  as  the  water-depth  on  the \nother  side  is  too  shallow.  The  benefits  of  improved  wharf  facilities  are  decreased \nturnaround  times  for  vessels  unloading  fish  and  reprovisioning  with  fuel,  water,  and \nstores,  resulting  in  better  vessel  economy  by  increasing  fishing  days.  In  addition,  the \ncurrent practice of rafting vessels together and having to handle cargo and passengers \nover several vessels will be eliminated. Current practices cause disruption to the efficient \nunloading  and  servicing  of  vessels,  pose  security  risks,  have  safety  and  hygiene \nimplications,  and  compromise  the  stringent  food  safety  requirements  for  export-quality \nfish. \n \n43. \nFurther growth of the tuna longline export industry in Lae is a key requirement for \nthe  provision  of  commercial  market  opportunities  for  small-scale  fishers.  The  growth  to \npresent  levels  of  fishing  activity  has  permitted  the  establishment  of  weekly  air-freight \nservices  from  Lae  to  Port  Moresby  by  PNG\u2019s  domestic  carrier,  Air  Niugini.  Further \ngrowth in the fleet will allow the development of additional air-freight capacity, which in \nturn  will  allow  small-scale  fishers  to  access  markets  in  Port  Moresby  or  overseas. \nSeveral of the existing tuna longline operators in Lae have already expressed interest in \npurchasing  high-value  seafood  products  from  small-scale  fishers  for  resale  in  Port \nMoresby or overseas. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Infrastructure  \n\n44. \nSmall-scale  fishers  in  PNG  generally  only  catch  fish  for  commercial  sale  when \ncash  is  needed  for  school  fees,  building  materials,  and  general  basic  needs.  The  high \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nfuel  prices  today  have  caused  most  small-scale  fishery  operations  to  be  only \nmarginally\u2014if  at  all\u2014profitable.  The  opportunistic  nature,  and  subsequent  erratic \ncatches,  of  the  fishery  has  little  attraction  for  export  traders,  who  rely  on  predictable \nregularity, volumes, and quality. The proposed jetties and adjacent facilities will, for the \nfirst time, provide an opportunity for small-scale fishers to collectively comply with such \nrequirements. Experiences from other small-scale fisheries projects point to a long time \nframe  before  consistent  fish  quality  and  regularity  are  reached.  Within  such  settings, \nquantifiable  benefits  cannot  be  applied  with  any  degree  of  certainty.  However,  the \ncombination of a growing private fishery sector and the increasing cash needs to pay for \nbasic necessities are likely to assure successful development. The proposed structures \nwill (i) improve the market opportunities for small-scale fishers; (ii) enable fish products \nto  be  landed  in  good  quality;  (iii)  provide  the  critical  mass  of  marine  products  through \ngrowth in the total number of fishers, thus making it worthwhile for traders to export; and \n(iii) greatly reduce damage to boats and the risk of personal injury. \n \n45. \nIn Daru, the jetty will eliminate the need to walk across the mud flats at low tide \ncarrying  goods  and  fish,  and  will  create  access  to  moored  boats.  This  will  significantly \nreduce  the  effort  in  carrying  goods  and  fish  to  the  shore,  reduce  the  health  risk  of \nexposure to the polluted mud, and reduce the contamination of fish and other products. \nThe present situation, where fish have to be carried across the mud, is inconsistent with \nNFA\u2019s  efforts  to  upgrade  hygiene  and  food  safety  standards  for  fish  export.  The  new \nfacilities  would  eliminate  this  problem  and  result  in  significant  time-savings  and \nincreased  convenience,  in  that  boats  tied  to  the  jetty  will  be  accessible  rather  than \nstranded  on  the  mudflats  or  moored  far  offshore  depending  on  the  state  of  the  tide. \nOther  advantages  include  better  security  for  boats  and  belongings  compared  with  the \npresent situation. \n \n46. \nSanderson Bay is the main harbor in Alotau, the provincial capital of Milne Bay. \nBecause of the large number of small vessels in the province, the harbor is congested \nand  overcrowded.  Fishing  vessels  tend  to  receive  lower  priority  than  coastal  trading  or \npassenger vessels and are often forced to moor in the middle of the bay and to load and \nunload in the muddy shore areas at the base of the bay, or to transfer products across \nother  vessels.  The  main  town  market  is  about  1.5  kilometer  from  the  wharf  and  no \nconsistent  means  of  transport  exists  between  the  two,  thus  fishers  have  difficulty \ntransporting their catch for sale. The suggested structures at Sanderson Bay will provide \ndirect  jetty  access  for  the  fishers,  and  the  improved  road  access  will  facilitate  better \ntransport to main markets.  \n \n47. \nAt Voco Point, more than 50 small boats at any time are moored directly onto the \npebble  beach.  Wave  action  often  damages  hull  and  outboard  engines,  and  makes \nmoving produce from the boat to the shore very difficult. The whole area is littered with \ngarbage,  and  the  hygienic  situation  in  general  does  not  allow  any  seafood  to  be \nmarketed for export. This situation will be alleviated with the construction of a jetty and \nsupplementary facilities. \n \n48. \nIn  Sanderson  Bay  and  at  Voco  Point,  the  safety  and  sanitation  situation  must \nalso be addressed. Very often women traders cannot sell all their produce the same day \nand,  therefore,  have  to  stay  overnight.  No  shelters  are  available  for  rest  areas  or  to \nprotect  the  products  for  sale.  The  beach  is  the  only  area  available  for  use  as  a  public \ntoilet. For many women traders, this poses a real risk of being accosted at the beach at \nnight  or  of  being  forced  to  provide  sex  for  \u201cprotection\u201d  of  their  belongings  during  the \n\n \n\n\fnight.  Thus,  the  Project  will  also  construct  sanitation  facilities  and  traditional  transit \nhouses or shelters to improve the safety situation during the night, especially for women. \nGiven the particular circumstances faced by the small-scale fishers, their income level, \nand the appalling safety and security conditions in general, provision of these facilities is \nmerited. \n \n49. \nOther benefits will also arise from these interventions. These include savings in \ntime  and  convenience  gained  by  direct  access  from  the  jetty,  reduced  risk  of  personal \ninjury  in  getting  on  and  off  vessels,  and  decreased  damage  or  loss  of  goods  being \ntransferred. The removal of the need for banana boats to pull up on the beach will also \nresult in reduced damage and repair costs from grounding on rocks, etc.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management \n\n50. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  and  headed  by  the  NFA \nprojects manager. It will have members from NFA\u2019s accounts division and the provincial \nand industrial liaison office, and include the project coordinator. The PIU will be assisted \nby  the  team  leader  of  the  international  consultants  and  by  the  consultants  who  will  be \ntasked  with  the  tendering  procedures  and  with  supervising  civil  works.  Specific \nresponsibilities  include  (i)  arranging  regular  steering  committee  meetings;  (ii)  providing \nbudgeting  and  accounting,  including  regular  accounts  auditing;  (iii)  preparing  loan \nwithdrawal  applications;  (iv)  arranging  for  the  tendering  and  contracting  of  the \ninfrastructure components; (v) handling procurement of equipment and materials where \nnecessary; and (vi) reporting. \n  \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n51. \nThe project design takes into account ADB\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction in \nits  member  countries.  While  the  longline  wharf  is  justified  on  quantified  benefits  (para. \n70), the other infrastructure components of the Project are justified on the basis of their \nlarger societal impacts (such as the reduced incidence of rape and HIV/AIDS) for which \nbenefit valuation is not readily possible. During the design phase of the Project, all of the \nwomen  interviewed  identified  sexual  abuse  as  the  highest  risk.  As  social  infrastructure \nonly  constitutes  12%  of  the  total  project  costs,  the  overall  economic  viability  of  the \nProject is not threatened. Surveys carried out during the project design phase indicated \nthat  the  potential  users  have  a  strong  willingness  to  pay  for  improvements  in  these \nfacilities.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project base cost is estimated at about $7.9 million equivalent. The total \n52. \nestimated project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest, is about \n$9.5  million  equivalent.  The  allowance  for  price  contingencies  over  the  implementation \nperiod is 5% for the first year and 7% per year thereafter for local costs, and 2.4% per \nyear  for  foreign  costs.  A  physical  contingency  of  10%  is  applied  to  the  base  cost.  A \nsummary is shown in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 3. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nTable 1.

The  Government  has  requested  that  the  foreign  exchange  and  local \ncurrency components of the Project be financed as shown in Table 2. \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n     Total \n     Percent \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange  \n \n5.70 \n0.93 \n6.63 \n 70 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n0.00 \n2.87 \n2.87 \n  30 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n5.70 \n3.80 \n9.50 \n  100 \n\n \nPercent \n \n60 \n40 \n     100 \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n54. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  SDR  4.284 \nmillion  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  60%  of  the  project  cost,  covering \napproximately  86%  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  Borrower  will  be  the \nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea. The proceeds of the loan will be relent to NFA \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\non  the  same  terms  and  conditions  through  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  in  form  and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n55. \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  NFA,  the  Government\u2019s  noncommercial  statutory \nauthority  legally  mandated  with  responsibility  for  managing  the  nation\u2019s  fishery \nresources.  NFA  has  demonstrated  its  capability  as  Executing  Agency  in  the  ongoing \nFisheries  Development  Project  and  is,  after  its  recent  restructuring,  well  suited  to \nundertake this function. NFA receives all the monies from access and license fees from \nthe distant-water-fishing fleet and the domestic commercial fleet, and therefore has the \nmeans to not only pay for its own operational costs but also to pay for various fisheries \nmanagement developments at the provincial level. \n \nNFA will have overall responsibility for implementing the Project, and has set up \n56. \na  PIU  within  NFA.  The  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  the  consultants  provided  under  the \nProject.  In  addition,  each  civil  works  component  includes  provisions  for  tender \npreparation and supervision, and the persons selected for these will also assist the PIU.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n57. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years. Most activities will be carried out \nduring  the  first  4  years.  Experience  shows  that  procedural  delays  almost  always  occur \nwithin  PNG,  resulting  in  slippage  of  both  inputs  and  outputs.  The  additional  year  is \nprovided  to  absorb  this  slippage.  The  Project  is  expected  to  commence  in  December \n2002  and  be  completed  by  December  2007.  The  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll procurement financed by the loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n58. \nfor Procurement. International competitive bidding will be applied for civil works valued at \n$1  million  or  more;  local  competitive  bidding  will  be  applied  for  civil  works  below  this \namount, where it is not expected to attract foreign contractors, and where capable local \ncontractors  are  in  country.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be  applied  for \nprocurement of goods with contract values estimated at less than $500,000 equivalent, \nand direct purchase for equipment valued at below $100,000 equivalent. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  require  a  total  of  224  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nincluding 115 person-months of international consulting: resource management advisor \nand  team  leader  (35),  environmental  monitoring  adviser  (5),  data  management  adviser \n(11),  fisheries  information  adviser  (12),  legal  adviser  (6),  community  fisheries  adviser \n(18), fisheries development adviser (18), and unallocated (10); and 109 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services:  engineering  specialist  (4),  resource  management \nspecialist  (30),  fisheries  data  specialist  (21),  documentation  and  information  specialist \n(30), HIV/AIDS training specialist (3), social assessment specialist (7), and unallocated \n(14). All consultants will be recruited by NFA under the quality and cost based selection \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n(QCBS)  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The shortlisted firms will be required to submit a \nfull  technical  proposal.  NFA  requested,  and  ADB  approved,  advance  action  for  the \nselection of consultants. Detailed terms of reference for consulting services are shown in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nNFA will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.9 \n60. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $250,000.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  expenditures  costing  less  than  $50,000 \nequivalent and for liquidation of advances made from the imprest account. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n61. \nNFA  will  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  NFA  will  (i)  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  Project;  (ii)  ensure  that  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  are \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB;  and  (iii)  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  close  of \neach  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  the  report  of  the  auditor. \nProvisions have been made for engaging external auditing through the Auditor General's \nOffice, with costs financed under the loan. A project completion report will be submitted \nto ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n62. \nA  project  steering  committee,  headed  by  the  Managing  Director  of  NFA,  will  be \nestablished and meet quarterly to discuss and guide project implementation and review \nthe  annual  planning  process.  The  committee  will  comprise  members  from  NFA,  the \ncommercial fishery sector, Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Department \nof Provincial Affairs, the Treasury, PNG Harbours Board, and other fishery stakeholders \nas appropriate. \n \nQuarterly reports detailing implementation progress, achievements in accordance \n63. \nwith the indicators in the project framework, disbursement, consulting inputs, as well as \nissues pertaining to disbursement projections for the following quarter and any delay in \nimplementation schedule, will be prepared by the PIU and submitted to NFA with copies \nmade available to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nAn  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  one  month  after  the  consultants  are  fielded \n64. \nand  an  initial  review  of  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  of \nimplementation. A midterm review will be undertaken approximately 30 months after the \n\n                                                 \n9   NFA is currently the executing agency for Loan 1656-PNG, which maintains an imprest account. NFA is \ntherefore familiar with the procedures for establishing and operating  an imprest account and  would be \nable to manage the new imprest account efficiently. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nstart  of  implementation  and  focus,  in  particular,  on  the  impact  and  results  of  the \ncommunity-based  activities.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  a  final  review  will  be \nundertaken. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n1. \n\nGeneral  \n\n65. \nThe benefits from the proposed Project are wide ranging, but primarily aimed at \npoorer coastal communities. They include specific benefits that can be directly attributed \nto narrowly defined interventions that can be quantified accurately, such as the improved \nwharf  facility  for  tuna  longliners.  Benefits  associated  with  the  fisheries  management \nsupport  can  be  roughly  quantified  in  terms  of  saved  present  value  of  the  otherwise \noverexploited  fish  stock,  and  the  diversion  of  effort  into  underutilized  fish  stock.  Other \nhard-to-quantify  benefits  associated  with  the  basic  social  structures  can  only  be \ndescribed in more general and qualitative ways. \n \n66. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  rural  coastal  communities.  Approximately  131,000 \nhouseholds,  which  comprise  23%  of  all  rural  households,  are  engaged  in  fishing  on  a \nregular  basis,  with  about  60%  fishing  for  purely  subsistence  consumption  and  40%  for \nconsumption as well as sale. This group will be the primary beneficiaries of the fisheries \nmanagement  support  component.  Beneficiaries  of  the  infrastructure  development \ncomponents  will  be  existing  and  new  small-scale  commercial  and  semicommercial \nfishers,  boat  passengers,  women  fish  traders,  and  commercial  longliners  within  the \nvicinity of Daru, Sanderson Bay, and Voco Point. Appendix 6 provides an assessment of \nthe poverty impact. \n \n\n2. \n\nFisheries Management Support \n\n67. \nThe proposed assistance for fisheries management support will ultimately result \nin  a  more  productive  and  sustainable  use  of  coastal  fishery  resources.  Large  benefits \nresults  from  investment  in  the  sustainable  use  of  a  renewable  resource  like  fisheries, \ncompared  with  the  alternative  of  overexploitation  and  eventual  exhaustion  of  the \nresource.  These  benefits  include  the  attainment  of  a  sustainable  level  of  exploitation, \nand  the  creation  of  a  more  certain  and  favorable  environment  for  the  private  sector  to \ninvest in fishing and value-adding enterprises. More certainty about the size of resources \nand  the  level  of  sustainable  catch  for  specific  fisheries  reduces  the  level  of  risk  for \ncommercial activities, which otherwise has to be factored into profit expectations.  \n \n68. \nThe  impact  of  this  component  can  be  best  assessed  by  roughly  estimating  the \nlikely  effects  on  the  total  value  of  the  coastal  fishery.  In  2000,  the  total  value  of  the \noutputs  of  coastal  fisheries  was  calculated  to  be  around  K120  million  per  year  ($36 \nmillion) (Supplementary Appendix A). With the effort to halt the overfishing of the stocks \nof  beche-de-mer  and  trochus,  which  combined  account  for  K20  million,  coupled  with \nassistance to direct the coastal fisheries toward underutilized fish stocks, a conservative \nincrease  in  the  value  of  production  of  5%,  equivalent  to  an  increase  of  K6  million  per \nyear ($1.8 million), can be assumed. This will equate to an incremental economic output \nper  family  of  K46  per  year  (130,000  families  live  in  the  coastal  communities).  The \nimproved  management  practices  resulting  from  the  Project  are  expected  to  encourage \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nsustainable exploitation and so prevent (or in some cases reverse) the decline of these \nresources.  \n \n69. \nApproximately  K1.7  million  will  be  required  to  maintain  the  momentum  of  the \nfisheries management support program after the conclusion of the 5\u2013year development \nperiod.  With  an  assumed  economic  impact  of  K6  million  per  year,  this  is  a  good \ninvestment for NFA to fund through its recurrent revenues. \n \n\n3. \n\nLongline Wharf \n\n70. \nSpecific  benefits  arising  from  the  capital  investment  include  (i)  incremental  net \ncatch  value  from  commercial  and  artisanal  fisheries  sold  for  export  and/or  in  local \nmarkets; (ii) increased savings in O&M costs and time savings for fisheries and transport \nboat  operators  from  improved  mooring  facilities  and  lower  turnaround  times.  Only  the \nVoco Point longline wharf component was subjected to an economic analysis. Based on \nthe benefits noted, the longline wharf has an economic internal rate of return of 24% and \nan  economic  net  present  value  of  K3.192  million  at  12%  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital.  The  economic  return  was  tested  for  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the  main \nparameters  of  costs  and  benefits,  and  indicates  that  the  longline  wharf  is  relatively \ninsensitive to changes in these factors (Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Infrastructure \n\n71. \nThe  benefits  derived  from  the  development  of  social  infrastructure  at  Daru, \nSanderson  Bay,  and  Voco  Point  will  be  improved  safety  and  security  for  the  many \nwomen traders, better movement of fish from sea to shore, better quality produce, and \nmore efficient transfer of goods to the marketing chains. In Sanderson Bay, local public \nservice vehicles will be able to park in a dedicated area to load fish for transport to the \nmarket  and  to  consumers  on  the  oil  palm  plantations  nearby,  thereby  improving  the \ntransportation link and increasing market opportunities for fishers and fish traders. As a \nresult  of  this  development,  coastal  fish  production  marketed  through  Sanderson  Bay \nharbor could increase significantly, perhaps doubling the present low production levels of \naround 500 kilograms per week. \n \n72. \nAdditional  benefits  relate  to  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  harbor  by  reducing \nvessel  turnaround  time.  Greater  numbers  of  small  boats  will  be  accommodated  in  a \nmore  compact  area,  reducing  the  general  congestion  and    obstruction  caused  by \nanchored vessels and their mooring lines. Time spent waiting for a mooring and having \nto move off moorings to make way for bigger vessels when the harbor is congested will \nalso be saved. Dredging of the harbor and removal of the dead coral head in the middle \nwill increase the capacity of the harbor and improve traffic flow. \n \n73. \nThese  benefits  can  be  quantified,  though  not  valued  due  to  data  constraints,  in \nterms  of  the  opportunity  cost  of  the  time  saved  for  the  passengers  going  about  their \nbusiness bringing their fish and goods to market. Around 170 boats with a total of almost \n2,500  passengers  are  currently  using  the  three  harbors  on  an  average  day.  This \ncorresponds to a total time saved of 1,445 hours per day (based on each person saving \nhalf an hour of his or her daily time in Sanderson Bay and Voco Pint, and 1 hour per day \nin  Daru  where  the  wider  mudflats  pose  a  greater  inconvenience).  On  an  annual  basis, \nthe total time saved is estimated at 527,425 hours per year, which on the basis of a 10- \nhour working day is equivalent to 52,743 person-days of time saved per year. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \nB. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\n \n\n74. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  give  rise  to  a  range  of  widespread,  indirect,  and \nnonquantifiable  benefits  that  cannot  be  captured  in  the  economic  analysis  of  the \ninvestment  component.  These  include,  initially,  prevention  of  further  decline  and, \nsubsequently,  sustained  or  even  improved  fishery  catch  for  food  and  commercial \npurposes  through  the  introduction  of  appropriate  management  regimes  for  inshore \nfishery  resources.  This  will  be  achieved  by  building  the  capacity  of  provincial  and  local \ngovernments  and  coastal  communities  for  planning,  improving  management  of  the \ninshore  fishery,  and  developing  of  information  services  and  flows  related  to  stock \nmanagement  and  marketing.  This  benefit  will  be  enhanced  through  the  promotion  of \ncommunity-based  management  arrangements  for  coastal  fishery  resources,  including \nempowerment  of  coastal  communities  by  reinforcing  custodial  and  traditional  rights  to \nresources  and  institutionalizing  greater  responsibility  for  their  management  and \nconservation.  \n \n75. \nThe net outcome of the Project as a whole is expected to be a more productive \nand sustainable coastal fishery, and increased income and employment creation leading \nto  improved  livelihoods  and  reduced  poverty  in  coastal  communities.  In  addition, \nnonquantifiable  benefits  are  expected  from  improved  stock  and  market  information, \nimproved  shore \nfor  passengers  and  marketers, \ntransshipment  to  market,  reduction  in  commercial  losses  due  to  delays  and  poor \nfacilities, and related lowered commercial risks. \n \n76. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction,  and  the  livelihood \nimprovements it generates will be pro-poor, having a proportionally greater impact on the \nquality of life of the rural poor in coastal areas than on other segments of the population. \nThe Project is targeted to coastal communities and districts that have a high portion of \ntheir  members  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Consequently,  the  distribution  of  benefits \nand social impact will be skewed to poorer communities (Appendix 6).  \n \nC. \n\nfacilities  and  public  amenities \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\nto \n\nfinancial  sustainability  analysis  as \n\nThe Voco Point wharf capital investment component and the social infrastructure \n77. \ncomponents  were  subjected \nthese  have \nimplications  for  recurrent  O&M.  In  principle,  the  users  should  be  required  to  contribute \nthrough  user  fees  at  a  sufficient  level  to  cover  at  least  the  O&M  expenses,  and  ideally \nmake  a  contribution  to  debt  servicing  and  a  reasonable  return  to  equity.  NFA  already \nholds several land titles or leases for fisheries infrastructure around the country and, in \nthe  past,  NFA  or  the  provincial  fisheries  authorities  managed  these  facilities.  Since  its \nrestructuring,  NFA  is  now  tendering  management  contracts  for  all  its  wharf  facilities  to \nthe private sector, which include O&M that will be covered through standard harbor fees \nand other applicable charges. This arrangement will also be implemented for the longline \nwharf  at  Voco  Point.  For  the  small  boat  jetties  and  related  infrastructures  at  Daru, \nSanderson Bay, and Voco Point, an annual registration fee is envisaged. It will be based \non size and capacity, and charged to cover the O&M expenses. An annual fee is easier \nto administer than other methods, because of the large number of boats (Supplementary \nAppendix F). \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\nPoverty in PNG is concentrated in the remote rural areas in the interior highland \n78. \nprovinces  and  in  coastal  communities  of  the  14  maritime  provinces.  The  coastal \ncommunities  are  typical  of  poor  rural  communities  where  poverty  incidence  is  about \n41%,  which  is  above  the  national  poverty  incidence  of  37%.  Whether  their  economic \nstatus puts them above or below the poverty line, most households rely on subsistence-\nbased  livelihoods\u2014each  is  dependent  on  farming  and/or  fishing  for  sustenance  and \ncash  income.  The  typical  household  is  an  extended  family  comprising  on  average  5\u20137 \nmembers. Those that sell fish or marine products have a division of labor generally along \ngender lines: male members do the fishing, and female members sell what they do not \nconsume  to  traders  or  in  the  local  market.  The  cash  income  thus  derived  is  spent  on \nfood staples and other basic necessities.  \n \nIn each target area, the harbor serves as the hub of the local fishing industry so \n79. \nthat  fishing  and  fish  trading  by  the  local  population  are  linked  to  the  facilities  and \nmarketing  opportunities  emanating  from  the  services  provided  to  fishing  vessels  that \ndock  for  fish  and  supplies.  The  Project\u2019s  investments  to  improve  the  harbor  facilities  in \neach target area will therefore generate a range of direct and spin-off effects related to \nthe  increased  value  and  volume  of  fish  and  marine  products  handled  at  each  harbor. \nThese are quantified in the economic analyses based on expected income earnings and \nemployment  benefits  for  the  many  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  whose  livelihoods  are \npartially or wholly linked to the fishing industry.  \n \n\n2. \n\n Gender and Social Issues \n\n80.  Women are expected to benefit most from improved facilities for retail fish trading \nand  processing  as  they  dominate  this  aspect  of  the  fishing  industry.  Specifically,  the \nsmall  boat  jetties  and  the  improved  access  to  the  commercial  fish  centers  will  open  a \nmarket for the fish and other commercially valuable marine products generally caught or \nsold by women traders and vendors. \n \n81. \nApart  from  the  economic  benefits,  other  nonmonetary  benefits  will  accrue  to \nwomen  through  the  activities  supported  under  the  community  fisheries  management \nprogram.  Women  will  be  targeted  for  the  small  business  training  and  technical \nassistance  activities,  encouraged  to  form  stakeholder  associations,  and  motivated  to \nparticipate in  other community-level activities to be sponsored by the Project. \n \nAn  important  issue  is  the  growing  HIV/AIDS  infection  rate  in  PNG,  especially \n82. \namong  women.  The  fishing  industry  is  suspected  to  be  one  of  the  main  sectors  where \nHIV/AIDS  is  transmitted.  The  Project\u2019s  support  for  a  training  and  public  awareness \nprogram on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases will be targeted at women and \ncommercial sex workers in the harbor areas.  \n \n83. \nA  second  issue  concerns  the  vulnerability  of  women  fish  vendors  to  rape  and \ncrime common in the harbor and beach areas. The improved jetties, and construction of \ntoilets  and  overnight  shelters  will  greatly  increase  the  personal  safety  of  women  who \notherwise would have to use unsecured public areas. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironment \n\nThe  environmental \n\n84. \nThe Project as designed will have significant positive environmental impacts. The \nfisheries  management  support  component  will  result  in  improved  coastal  marine \nresources, and will lead to increased awareness and positive attitudes regarding marine \nresource  conservation  and  management.  The  project  management  component  is \nenvironmentally neutral.  \n \ninfrastructure \n85. \nsubcomponents were considered as part of the site selection and design process. The \nfacilities  in  each  location  were  examined  thoroughly  in  an  environmental  screening \nprocess,  which  involved  site  visits,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  review  of  available \ndocumentation. The initial environmental examination (Supplementary Appendix D) and \nits  summary  (Appendix  8)  conclude  that  the  proposed  infrastructure  activities  will  have \nno significant residual environmental impacts. \n \n\nthe  proposed  coastal \n\nimplications  of \n\n4. \n\nImpact Management Measures \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nidentified \n\nProposed \n\nimpact  management  measures  were \n\n86. \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  and  include  specific  design  features,  recommendations  for \nbest  practices  for  construction,  and  development  of  operational  procedures  and \ncontingency plans to reduce the risk of accidental events (such as fuel spills). All these \nenvironmental  management  measures  are  conditions  in  the  tenders,  and  the  selected \ncontractor will be responsible for their implementation. \n \n87. \nEnvironmental and social benefits monitoring was included in the costing of each \ninfrastructure  component  to  ensure  that  the  environmental  management  measures  are \ncomplied  with  and  to  confirm  the  predictions  of  environmental  effects  that  may  be \nassociated  with  the  subprojects.  Monitoring  is  also  to  be  supported  by  technical \nassistance,  to  ensure  suitable  design  of  monitoring  activities  and  the  quality  of  results \nand interpretations. \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n1. \n\nCountry Risk \n\nProjects  in  PNG  face  many  risks.  The  poor  transparency  and  accountability  in \n88. \npublic  administration  are  well  documented  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  in  various \nreports10  and  present  a  number  of  problems  and  risks  to  project  design  and \nimplementation.  Political  instability  and  shifting  policies  also  tend  to  dampen  investor \nconfidence. \n \n89. \nThe  PNG  economy  has  had  shocks  outside  of  the  control  of  the  Government. \nThe  El  Ni\u00f1o  drought  of  1997;  the  Asian  financial  crisis;  the  continuing  decline  in \ncommodity prices for copra, coffee, and cocoa; and the increases in world oil prices in \n2000 and 2001 have resulted in considerable macroeconomic volatility.  \n \n90. \nIn community development, determining the appropriate implementation period is \ndifficult.  Most  people  living  in  coastal  communities  in  PNG  have  short-term  needs  and \n\n                                                 \n10 For example ADB. 1999. Country Operational Strategy Study: Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nobligations,  that  are  in  direct  contrast  to  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  Project.  To \nsuccessfully organize communities under such circumstances may turn out to be more \ntime consuming than envisaged. \n \nThe  country  also  has  a  serious  law  and  order  problem,  more  apparent  in  the \n91. \ncities than in the provinces, which discourages investment and reduces the profitability \nof business. This is exacerbated by extreme poverty in many areas, particularly in some \ninland areas, such as the highlands and Morobe Province, and in settlements around the \nlarger  towns.  The  looming  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  is  also  a  threat,  and  promises  to  hit  the \neducated, productive, and economically active age groups hardest.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand and Marine Tenure \n\n92. \nLand disputes continue to bedevil many investment projects in PNG. Traditional \nlandowners  continually  interfere  with,  or  sabotage,  the  operations  of  commercial \nenterprises,  public  utilities,  and  even  hospitals  and  schools  in  their  attempts  to  forcibly \nincrease royalties, obtain compensation, or otherwise enhance the benefits they receive \nfrom leases or agreements relating to their land. In some cases, especially in regard to \nmineral exploitation or large-scale industrial projects, provincial or national governments \nmay  try  to  accelerate  projects  by  unilaterally  speaking  on  behalf  of  landowners,  which \ninvariably leads to disputes later on. In some cases, agreed projects have been blocked \nfor months or years because landowning groups cannot agree among themselves about \nhow benefits should be distributed. \n \nThe  Government  is  trying  to  introduce  land  registration  to  identify  who  or  which \n93. \ngroups lay claim to land in different parts of the country. This reform has met with strong \nopposition, and is seen by many as an attempt to alienate traditional owners from their \nland. While this is not the objective of the reforms, the issue has recently been used to \nstir up public opinion against the government of the day. \n \n94. \nFor  the  infrastructure  parts  of  the  Project,  ensuring  the  absence  of  land  tenure \nproblems as a prerequisite to site selection has minimized the problems relating to land \ntenure.  All  the  infrastructure  interventions  will  take  place  on  land  to  which  the \nGovernment holds title. While this approach does not entirely guarantee the absence of \nproblems, it minimizes their likelihood. \n \n95.  Marine  tenure  presents  its  own  somewhat  different  set  of  problems,  but  these \ncan be transformed into opportunities by proper handling. The tenure systems in place \nare  not  defined  adequately  in  the  law  of  the  country,  although  they  are  acknowledged. \nThe prerequisites for community-based management include the definition of boundaries \nand the acknowledgement of rights. While the latter is, in theory at least, acknowledged, \nboundaries  have  not  been  formally  established  in  the  marine  zone  and  are  subject  to \ndispute.  The  issue  of  deploying  fish  attracting  devices,  straddling  different  community \nmarine tenure claims, will necessitate written agreements from all involved communities \nbefore deployment. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe  PNG  Government,  as  borrower,  will  onlend  the  funds  to  NFA.  Under  this \n96. \narrangement,  NFA  will  be  responsible  for  the  provision  of  counterpart  funds  and  for \nfinancing the debt service on the loan. At the present time, NFA is generating more than \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nsufficient revenue in access fees, license fees, and fines to meet such an obligation, and \ncurrent projections indicate that this situation will continue. However, several factors may \nact to reduce NFA\u2019s income. These include (i) relocation of foreign fishing efforts further \neast away from the PNG zone; this is expected over the next 1\u20132 years as a result of the \nstrong El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon currently developing; (ii) increasing domestication of PNG\u2019s \nfisheries, which will tend to displace foreign vessels paying access fees; (iii) changes in \nGovernment policy on fishery access (for instance, granting of access as an adjunct to \npolitical  or  economic  agreements);  and  (iv)  changes  in  Government  policy  towards \nNFA\u2019s financial autonomy. \n \n97. \nThe  major  generalized  financial  risk  is  the  continued  instability  of  the  PNG \neconomy, against a background of lowering export revenues, a declining currency, and \npolitical uncertainty. The continued fall in the value of the kina is of major concern, and is \nhaving  negative  effects  on  the  buying  power  of  the  bulk  of  the  population.  It  does, \nhowever,  contribute  to  the  continuing  profitability  of  PNG\u2019s  export-oriented  domestic \nfisheries,  whose  operation  is  central  to  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  declining  kina \nencourages  the  purchase  of  domestic  fish  products  and  a  corresponding  decline  in \nimports. \n \n\n4. \n\nTechnical Risks  \n\n98. \nPNG  sits  on  the  edge  of  the  \u201cring  of  fire\u201d  around  the  Pacific  and  is  subject  to \nseismic and volcanic activity. The main technical risks to the Project are geological and \nmarine  processes,  including  tsunamis  (tidal  waves),  earthquakes,  surges  and  seiches, \nland  slips  caused  by  seismic  activity,  volcanic  eruptions,  and  sedimentation  from  river \ndeposition. The southeast of the country is also subject to cyclones. Designing a project \nfor  all  these  possible  natural  disasters  is  impossible.  While  the  infrastructure  plans  are \ncompliant  with  design  and  construction  guidelines  and  local  rules  currently  in  force  for \nthe Project, a serious natural disaster will present a risk to the Project. \n \n99. \nThe project design takes into account the existence of these risks to the greatest \ndegree  possible.  Given  the  likelihood  of  the  risks  occurring,  the  benefits  and  positive \nimpacts  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  and  will  bring  significant \nimprovement to the quality of life of the rural poor at a time when other options may be \nlimited or unavailable. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following \n\n100. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i)  HIV/AIDS. The Government will carry out an HIV/AIDS training and awareness \ncampaign  through  vocational  training  programs  at  the  National  Fisheries \nCollege,  sensitization  programs  for  fishing  business  managers,  and  peer \neducation  programs \nthe  workplace  and  coastal \ncommunities. \n\nto  be  carried  out \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n(ii)  Gender  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  gender  awareness \ntraining \nfor  government  officials,  private  sector  managers,  and  other \nparticipants  in  the  community-based  fisheries  development  and  management \ncomponent of the Project is carried out. \n\n \n(iii)  Marine  tenure.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  prior  to  deployment  of  any \nfish attracting devices, all concerned communities will have agreed in writing to \nshared use of these devices.     \n\n \n\n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure that the Project is accorded \nhigh priority and that adequate funds are allocated for disbursement for project \nactivities beginning in 2002 and for subsequent years, and that procedures are \nin  place  for  timely  release  of  funds  for  project  activities  throughout  project \nimplementation. \n\n \n(v)  Benefit monitoring and evaluation. The Government will ensure that  project \nimplementation, and the overall benefits derived therefrom, are monitored and \nevaluated  on  an  annual  basis  in  accordance  with  a  program  satisfactory  to \nADB. \n\n \n(vi)  Environment. With respect to the infrastructure components of the Project, the \nGovernment  will  comply  with  all  applicable  national,  provincial,  and  local \nenvironmental laws; comply with all applicable ADB environmental guidelines; \nand ensure that any adverse environmental impacts related to the construction \nand  operation  of  the  facilities  under  the  Project  are  minimized  through \nimplementation  of \nthe  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  programs \nrecommended  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  report  concerned  and \nagreed upon with ADB. \n\n \n(vii)  User  fees.  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  cause  to  ensure,  that  fees \napplicable  for  use  of  the  project  wharves  and  jetties  will  be  set  at  levels  that \nallow for cost recovery of at least the ongoing O&M costs of each such facility. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n101.  The Government has agreed that prior to loan effectiveness, the PSC will be set \nup and a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and NFA for relending the \nloan proceeds to NFA, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, will be executed and \neffective. \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Contract Award \n\n102.  The  Government  will  not  award,  and  will  ensure  that  the  relevant  province  or \nNFA  does  not  award,  any  civil  works  contract  for  the  construction  or  improvement  of \ninfrastructure under the Project until the Government, the relevant province, or NFA has \n(i) obtained all land, including all rights therein, necessary for such infrastructure, and (ii) \nobtained  all  permits  and  licenses  (including  environmental  clearances)  necessary  for \nsuch  civil  works  contract.  The  Government,  the  relevant  province,  or  NFA  will,  in \nparticular, have provided ADB with the following documents:  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\na  letter  from  the  Borrower,  the  relevant  province,  or  NFA  certifying  that  (i) \nall land necessary for the specific infrastructure is the property of, or leased \nby,  the  Government,  the  relevant  province,  or  NFA,  (ii)  if  there  are \ncustomary  rights  on  such  land,  the  beneficiaries  of  such  customary  rights \nhave agreed to the use of the land for the proposed infrastructure; and (iii) \nthe Government, the relevant province, or NFA authorizes the construction \nor improvement of the proposed infrastructure on such land;  \n\na copy of the lease agreement or any other document satisfactory to ADB \nshowing  the  Government\u2019s,  the  relevant  province\u2019s,  or  NFA\u2019s  right  to  use \nthe land; and \n\nif  there  are  customary  rights  on  the  land,  a  copy  of  the  arrangement \nbetween  the  Government,  the  relevant  province,  or  NFA,  and  the \ncustomary rights beneficiaries relating to the use of the land for the purpose \nof the proposed infrastructure. \n\n24 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n103. \nAgreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,284,000 to the Independent State of \nPapua  New  Guinea  for  the  Coastal  Fisheries  Management  and  Development  Project \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\n \nTADAO CHINO \n\n                                                                                                                  President \n\n \n30 September 2002 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nGoal \nContribute to reduced level of \npoverty in the coastal fishing \ncommunities \nPurpose \nSustainable fisheries development \nfor the coastal marine resources is \ndeveloped and implemented with \nbroad stakeholder participation. \n \nOutputs \n1.

Costs for \n1. \nthe 5-year project were prepared using COSTAB and are based on prices prevailing in Papua \nNew Guinea in the third quarter of 2001 expressed on a calendar year basis. The costs include \nan  allowance  for  taxes  and  duties  that  currently  prevail  (mostly  10%  value  added  tax).  No \nallowance has been made for exemptions from taxes and duties that may apply to the Project. \nCosts are expressed in kina and dollars using an exchange rate of K3.846 = $1.0 that prevailed \nin March 2002. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAn  allowance  of  10%  of  base  costs  is  allowed  for  the  physical  contingency  for  civil \nworks,  while  for  most  other  items  (training,  materials,  etc)  a  rate  of  5%  is  used,  except  for \nspecialist  services  where  the  rate  is  set  at  zero.  The  price  escalation  factor  for  the  local  cost \ncomponent is 5% for the first year (remainder of 2001), then 7% per year thereafter, while for \nforeign  costs  a  rate  of  2.4%  is  used  for  each  year.  These  rates  are  based  on  recent  Asian \nDevelopment Bank projections for PNG. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nTotal project costs amount to $9.5 million (K36.500 million equivalent) including physical \ncontingencies  of  $0.78  million  and  price  contingencies  of  $0.56  million.  Taxes  and  duties  are \nestimated  at  $0.667  million.  Foreign  exchange  costs  amount  to  $6.6  million  or  65%  of  total \ncosts. It is assumed that ADB will provide loan financing of $5.7 million equivalent, or up to 60% \nof  total  project  costs,  covering  approximately  86%  of  the  foreign  exchange  requirements.  The \nPNG Government will fund the balance of $3.8 million equivalent, or 40% of the total, including \nall recurrent operational costs.  \n\nTotal Project Costs and Financing \n\n4. \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \n\nThe Project is composed of three components: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nCapital Investment: $2.230 million (28% of base costs); \nFisheries Management Support: $4.179 million (51%); \nProject Management: $1.745 million (21%). \n\nDetailed Cost Tables \n\nThe following tables are presented from the COSTAB analysis.\n\n\f \n \n\n                Table A3.1: Total Project Costs by Components (including contingencies) \n\n \n\n \n\nComponent\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nTotal\n\nA.

Social  surveys  of  coastal  fishers \nwere undertaken in five coastal locations. Consultations were held with various fishers, \ncommunity members, government official business people, nongovernment organization \nrepresentatives, and others who might have a direct interest in the infrastructure facilities \nand  harbor  improvements  being  proposed,  or  in  the  community-based  management \nactivities undertaken. The social surveys were conducted at sites where the provision of \nnew or improved infrastructure would generate significant social benefits.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nParticipatory  rural  appraisal,  using  questionnaires  and  structured  interview \ntechniques,  were  used  to  standardize  the  information  collected.  A  rapid  focused  group \nassessment  was  done  to  examine  HIV/AIDS  issues1  affecting  employees  of  the \ncommercial fishing industries, artisanal fishers, and processing workers.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSocioeconomic Information \n\nSurvey Methodology \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Indicators \n\n \nThe United Nations Development Programme calculates the human development \n3. \nindex as a composite of 3 factors: (i) longevity, as measured by life expectancy at birth; \n(ii)  educational  attainment  as  measured  by  a  combination  of  adult  literacy  (2/3  weight) \nand  the  combined  gross  enrolment  ratio  (1/3  weight);  and  (iii)  standard  of  living  as \nmeasured by gross domestic product. PNG, as classified by these indicators, measures \n0.314, in the low human development category (under 0.5), along with countries such as \nBurundi and Mali. \n \nThe gender related developmental index is similar to human development index \n4. \nexcept  that  it  shows  the  level  of  development  of  women.  In  PNG  this  is  0.318.  Once \nagain  anything  under  0.5  is  low  and  this  figure  of  0.318  puts  PNG  159th  out  of  175 \ncountries  where  it  has  been  measured.  The  gender  related  developmental  index  also \nreflects quality of life using indicators such as leading a long life, being knowledgeable, \nand enjoying a decent standard of living. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty \n\n5. \nA comprehensive analysis of poverty and access to public services in PNG was \nprepared  by  the  World  Bank  in  19992  based  on  information  from  the  1996  Household \nSurvey. This estimated that 37% of the population could be considered as poor, or living \nbelow the national poverty line. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas, with 41% of the \nrural population is considered as living below the poverty line.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n2   World Bank. 1999. Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services, Report No. 19584-PNG. \n\nWashington. \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThe survey took into account access to social services such as education, health \n6. \ncare, rural infrastructure, transport, and utilities. Access to these services is substantially \nworse for the lower income groups and for those living in more isolation. In this regard \nthe  coastal  communities  are  comparatively  worse  off  and  have  a  greater  proportion  of \nhouseholds  falling  under  the  poverty  line.  The  Momase/North  Coast  region  has  the \nhighest incidence and extent of poverty in PNG, contributing 36% to the national total.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCoastal Fishing Communities \n\n7. \nIn  all  the  sites  visited,  women  were  the  ones  responsible  for  the  sale  of  family \nproducts  (although  their  husbands  take  the  cash  and  manage  the  money).  Most  of  the \ntime,  because  of  the  duration  of  the  trip  to  the  town  market,3  and  the  lack  of  ice,  the \nwomen also process the fish they are selling (reef and pelagic fish, shells, and  crabs, \nwhich are cooked or smoked). This adds labor time to the product but reduces its value \nby half at least. Most of the women interviewed during the present study came from rural \nareas  (coastal  villages)  and  belong  to  the  39%  of  the  nonremunerated  part  of  the  total \neconomically active population who rely on subsistence farming and fishing activities.  \n\n8. \nA  survey  carried  out  from  July  to  August  1996  under  the  Coastal  Fisheries \nDevelopment  Project4  in  Lae  shows  that,  in  the  three  villages  monitored,  even  if  the \nsurvey  fell  outside  the  main  fishing  season,  fishing  activities  represented  the  most \nimportant single source of cash income. Revenues from fishing accounted for between \n38\u201474% of cash income in the households.  \n\nAt market, the women have to face competition from the other villages, most of \n9. \nthem selling the same kind of products. To sell their merchandise\u2014which they might not \nmanage\u2014they also have to spend a long time in the market town. This may sometimes \nbe  several  days,  very  often  in  the  most  dreadful  hygienic  and  comfort  conditions  (no \nwater, toilets, shelter; nowhere to sleep; lack of security, etc). They also have to pay a \n(small)  fee  to  the  town  market,  even  if  they  are  sitting  on  the  floor.  Having  sold  their \nproducts,  the  marketers  go  to  the  shops  and  buy  the  goods  they  need:  food  products \n(rice  and  sugar,  sometimes  vegetables)  and/or  nonfood  products  (kerosene  and  soap \nbeing the most usual ones). \n \n10. \nThe infrastructure recommended in this project at Alotau, Daru, and Lae should \ncover some of these women's basic needs on-site such as shelter, drinkable water, and \ntoilets  facilities.  Furthermore,  by  creating  a  hub  for  longliners  and  a  space  where \ninvestors can build fish processing facilities, they potentially open a market for the fish or \nother  more  valued  species  caught  by  the  women  from  coastal  villages  and  create \nopportunities for earning cash income.  \n \nThe  other  problems  linked  with  poverty\u2014low  literacy  level,  excessive  workload \n11. \nfinance  providers \nlinked  with  PNG  cultural  aspects,  malnutrition, \n(microfinance),  awareness  and \ntechniques,  market \nopportunities, conservation measures, bookkeeping and small business management)\u2014 \ncan  only  be  addressed  at  the  village  level.  Whatever  benefits  the  new  infrastructure  is \ndirectly  and  indirectly  providing,  they  will  not  arise  if  those  very  problems  are  not \n                                                 \n3  In Morobe Province, the furthest villages can be located 150 or even 200 kilometers (km) away and the \n\nfisheries  (fishing \n\nlinkage  with \n\ntraining \n\nin \n\nmaximum distances between fishing grounds and Lae market can reach up to 200 km.  \n\n4  Moma  Coastal  Fisheries  Development  Project,  Technical  Cooperation  Papua  New  Guinea  and  the \n\nFederal Republic of Germany. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n43\n\nGender Issues \n\naddressed at the community level. Consequently, these aspects will be addressed under \nthe fisheries management support component of the Project. \n \nC. \n \n12.  Women  are  major  participants  in  the  PNG  fishing  industry  even  if  they  are  not \noften  credited  for  it.  They  are  responsible  for  a  large  proportion  of  subsistence  fishing, \nare  becoming  increasingly  involved  in  artisanal  fishing  for  commercial  purposes,  carry \nout  most  of  the  marketing  of  the  artisanal  catch  (including  smoking  and  other  types  of \nartisanal  processing),  and  undertake  all  the  processing  of  PNG\u2019s  industrial  fish  catch. \nDevelopment of PNG fisheries will rely heavily on the participation of women. However, \ndespite  their  importance  to  both  small-scale  and  large-scale  fishing  in  PNG,  women \nhave  little  or  no  say  in  resource  management,  small-scale  development,  or  industry \nplanning.  As  in  other  sectors  of  the  PNG  economy,  they  remain  second-class  citizens \nwith no economic power or political influence.  \n \nThe  project  design  provides  for  the  conduct  of  gender  awareness  training  at  all \n13. \nlevels  and  throughout  the  project  life.  In  addition,  activities  promoting  small-scale \nfisheries development will be targeted to women wherever possible, in order to provide \nbusiness opportunities in which women can participate. This will be done using gender \nand development methodology in which gender becomes integrated into all project and \nmanagement activities.5  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nHIV/AIDS  cases  in  PNG  have  risen  exponentially  in  recent  years,  although  it  is \nstill  considered  to  have  low  prevalence  compared  with  some  other  countries.  In  June \n2001,  the  statistics  provided  by  the  National  AIDS  Council  Secretariat  revealed \ncumulative  HIV/AIDS  cases  at  3,901  HIV,  1,366  AIDS,  and  249  deaths.  In  2001,  48% \nmore cases were reported than during the same period in 2000. Due to lack of testing, \ngeneralized  figures  are  acknowledged  to  be  unreliable,  but  in  2001,  more  than  20,000 \nindividuals HIV positive.  \n \n15. \nIn PNG, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major public health problem \nespecially  for  women  in  the  reproductive  age  group.  Recently  this  has  become  of \nincreased  importance  because  of  the  increasing  prevalence  of  HIV  infection;  infection \nrates of STDs are being indicative of likely HIV/AIDS infection rates. A recent study on \nthe  prevalence  of  HIV  and  STD  found  3%  of  Lae-based  sex  workers  and  16%  of  sex \nworkers  in  Port  Moresby  tested  HIV  positive.  STD  rates  among  sex  workers  were  on \naverage 33% with syphilis; 32% with chlamydia, and 36% with gonorrhea. \n \n\nHIV/AIDS in the PNG Fishing Industry \n\n1. \n\nArtisanal and Rural Fishers \n\n \n16.  Women  who  sell  fish  often  do  not  earn  enough  after  the  sale  of  their  catch  at \nmarkets  to  pay  for  the  trip  home  or  for  nonfood  item  purchases,  and  get  forced  by \ncircumstance  into  selling  sex  to  make  up  for  the  shopping  and  transport  fees.  Places \n                                                 \n5   This contrasts with the women-specific approach, generally referred to as women in development, which \nsuffers  from  two  drawbacks.  First,  it  tends  to  contribute  to  the  isolation  of  women  from  development \nactivities,  and  second,  there  is  always  a  danger  that  such  projects  may  be  used  as  token  indicators  of \nefforts on behalf of women, without any strong policy commitment to incorporating women\u2019s role into the \noverall development process. \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nwhere  no  water,  toilet  facilities  and  rest  areas  are  available  are  difficult  for  female  fish \ntraders wishing to stay overnight in the market town. Men provide security in exchange \nfor sex, while those who provide water, accommodation, and toilets sometimes insist on \ntrading these services for sex. Some women wait until dark to use the beach as a toilet, \nbut youths hang around to wait for opportunities to sexually assault women heading for \nthe beach. \n \n\na. \n\nProposed Activities \n\n17. \nAt present HIV/AIDS is taught at the National Fisheries College (NFC) in the first \naid  course  only.  A  Red  Cross  volunteer  is  teaching  this  subject.  This  is  obviously  not \nadequate  and  the  Project  will  assist  NFC  to  introduce  a  module  on  HIV/AIDS  in  every \ncourse and provide materials for the module. \n \n18. \nThe Project is expected to subcontract NFC to undertake the training. A domestic \nconsultant  specialized  in  HIV/AIDS  material  preparation  and  awareness  will  provide \nshort-term assistance to NFC and tuna canneries, and possibly also to nongovernment \norganizations.  The  material  will  be  targeted  to  cover  most  areas  in  the  fishing  industry \nand will be prepared in close collaboration with the National AIDS Council. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n45\n\n \nA. \n\nApproach and Basic Assumptions \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND BENEFITS \n\nThe  two  components  of  the  Project:  fisheries  management  support  and  basic  social \n1. \nstructures are not considered amenable to full economic analysis, although their benefits can be \nsignificant as discussed in paras 65 and 66 of the main text. This appendix presents economic \nanalysis of the capital investment component of the longline wharf at Voco Point in Lae. \n\n2. \n\nThe basic assumptions applied to the economic analysis here are the following.  \n\n(i)  Life of the subprojects is assumed to be 25 years.  \n\n(ii)  Prices  used  in  the  analysis  were  identified  through  a  variety  of  secondary  sources  in \naddition to field trips to the proposed project sites. All benefits and costs are measured in \nconstant 2001 prices to exclude inflation by applying the World Bank\u2019s manufacturers unit \nvalue for traded components and gross domestic product deflator for local costs.  \n\n(iii)  Economic pricing was done using the world price numeraire with the national currency kina \nas  the  unit  of  account,  based  on  an  exchange  rate  of  $1  =  K3.846  prevailing  in  March \n2002.  \n\n(iv)  All  taxes  and  other  transfer  payments  are  removed  from  financial  costs  and  benefit \nstreams  to  convert  financial  prices  into  economic  prices.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of \n0.9  is  applied  to  revalue  nontraded  goods  and  services  at  the  world  price  level  in  the \nnational currency. \n\n(v)  Major  tradable  commodities  (export  grade  sashimi  and  reef  fish),  are  valued  at  border \n\nprices. \n\n(vi)  Project  investment  costs  comprise  actual  financial  costs  for  all  civil  works,  design  and \n\nsupervision, equipment, and vehicles.  \n\n(vii)  Marine  product  border  prices  are  adjusted  for  quality  differences,  transport,  handling, \nmarketing,  and  other  costs  to  determine  export  parity  price  at  local  wharves  where \nnecessary. \n\nSubproject Analysis \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  redeveloped  and  reconfigured  wharf  at  Voco  Point  would  provide  sufficient  space \nfor three longline vessels of 15\u201320 meters to berth at the same time, compared with space for \none at present and in the without project situation. The facilities could realistically be expected \nto  be  able  to  accommodate  a  fleet  of  20  longliners  based  in  Lae,  provided  that  port  visits  to \nunload fish are staggered throughout the week to coincide with airfreight schedules. This can be \ncompared with the 5 vessels that currently use the harbor and the stated intention of the existing \nfishing companies to increase the number of vessels to around 10 in the near future.  \n\n4. \nConservatively,  the  benefit  from  the  harbor  development  can  be  taken  to  be  a  net \nincrease of 7 longline vessels using the improved facilities, assuming that some increase in the \nnumber of boats will occur in the future regardless without the Project. The increased production \nfrom these vessels can be counted as a direct economic benefit based on the assumption that \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nthe increase in production is a real increase in national fishing activity, not just a reallocation of \nfishing activities from other fishing ports. It can be further assumed that there will be an increase \nin  efficiency  and  time  savings  for  the  number  of  longliners  using  the  harbor  now,  and  the \nplanned increase in numbers in the near future. More berth space and better facilities will allow \nvessels to be unloaded and resupplied more quickly, resulting in faster turnaround and a small \nincrease in fishing days per year. Demand for fresh fish is good and the Fisheries Department in \nMorobe Province considers that the market is undersupplied. In addition, Lae is the gateway to \nthe Highlands where many of the country\u2019s growing population live. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic impact \n\n5. \nThe quantifiable economic benefit is the production from 7 longliners made up of chilled \ntuna exported for the sashimi market and the value of by-catch sold on the local market. If the \ntotal incremental production is assumed to be 700 tons (t) per year (100 t per vessel) valued at \na  net  economic  benefit  of  K1,933  per  ton  ($580)  after  allowing  for  the  capital  and  operating \ncosts of a typical longliner, then the incremental benefit would amount to K1.353 million per year \n($406,000). In economic prices the capital costs of developing the wharf are estimated at K3.36 \nm  ($0.874  m)  and  the  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  at  K168,000  ($44,000) \nrepresenting 5% of the capital costs. The details are shown in Table A7.1.  \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47\n\n \n\nTable A7.1: Economic Analysis for Voco Point Harbor Development \n\n(For commercial wharf facilities only, not including smallboat facilities)\n\nK '000\n\nItem\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\u2026..\n\n25\n\nYear\n5\n\nA.

The  results  have  been \ntested  through  an  increase  in  benefits  of  10%  from  the  base  case,  and  conversely  a  10% \ndecrease.  A  10%  decrease  and  10%  increase  in  project  costs  have  also  been  applied.

An  analysis  of  the  1994 \npopulation census1 indicated that a total of 130,000 households, or around 500,000 people were \nliving  in  coastal  communities  in  the  country.  This  group  can  be  regarded  as  the  people  who \nwould  be  most  affected  by  the  Project.  Of  these,  about  23%  were  engaged  in  fishing  on  a \nregular  basis,  with  about  60%  fishing  for  their  own  consumption  and  40%  for  their  own \nconsumption and for sale. Based on these figures, an estimated 30,000 households are actively \ninvolved  in  fishing,  which  at  an  average  of  five  members  per  household  represents  150,000 \npeople.  The  most  recent  population  census  of  2000  indicates  that  the  country\u2019s  population  is \ngrowing at around 3% per year. Applying this percentage increase to the 1994 figures to allow \nfor  the  increase  in  population  during  the  intervening  6  years  increases  the  number  of  people \ninvolved  directly  in  fishing  to  179,000.  This  group  would  be  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject  who  would  benefit  directly  from  the  outcome.  In  addition,  a  larger  pool  of  secondary \nbeneficiaries would also benefit from the increased supply of fish, improved wharf facilities, and \nthe  multiplier  effects  of  an  increase  in  disposable  income  in  the  community.  This  group  would \ninvolve the larger coastal communities of around 500,000 people. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   National Statistics Office. 1994.

This appendix highlights only relevant and \nimportant issues. The complete report is provided in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nA. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe objective of the proposed Project in Lae Harbor is (i) to meet the immediate \nneeds  of  fishery  operators  who  are  based  in  Lae  and  expected  entrants  to  the  tuna \nlongline  fishery  in  the  next  5\u201310  years,  and  (ii)  to  improve  the  conditions  for,  and \nefficiency of, the small boat operators who are presently forced to use the beach at Voco \nPoint. These improvements are expected to create spin-off economic opportunities and \nsocial  benefits  for  coastal  communities  in  Morobe  Province.  While,  the  objective  of  the \nProject  in  Sanderson  Bay  is  to  improve  facilities  and  harbor  conditions  for  small  boat \noperators and the passengers they carry. These improvements are expected to increase \nthe  efficiencies  of  the  harbor  users  and  provide  social  benefits  in  optimizing  the  links \nbetween sellers from the islands and transportation services in Alotau. The objective of \nthe Project in Daru is to provide small boat access to the onshore market and exporters. \nThese will improve services for the many small boat operators and marketers who need \nto access Daru.  \n \nB. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nEnvironmental and Social Problems Due to Project Location \n\n1. \n \nNo  significant  negative  environmental  or  social  impacts  are  expected  with \n3. \nconstruction of facilities at Voco Point in Lae Harbor. The main reason for this conclusion \nis  that  the  site  is  located  within  the  port  boundary.  It  is  already  influenced  by  port \nactivities,  and  the  location  does  not  support  any  sensitive  coastal  and  marine  habitats, \nsuch  as  coral  reefs,  seagrass  beds,  and  mangrove  forests.  The  simple  facilities \nproposed  for  the  beach  at  Voco  Point  are  intended  solely  for  the  benefit  of  the  beach \nusers, and will involve only limited construction activity. \n \nNo  significant  negative  environmental  or  social  impacts  are  expected  with \n4. \nconstruction of a timber jetty, shore-based facilities, shore protection works, and harbor \nimprovements which are a function of their location in Sanderson Bay. The main reason \nfor  this  conclusion  is  that  the  project  site  is  already  influenced  by  harbor  activities  and \nthe bay only supports one limited but robust seagrass bed. A patch coral reef in the bay \nis almost completely dead and there are no mangrove forests. \n \n5. \nNo significant negative environmental impacts are expected with construction of \na  timber  wharf  on  piles,  because  no  sensitive  coastal  or  marine  habitats  are  to  be \naffected by the Project. \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Associated with the Construction Stage \n\n2. \n \n6. \nAll  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  facilities  at \nVoco  Point  are  deemed  to  be  insignificant,  because  of  the  absence  of  any  sensitive \ncoastal and marine habitats in the vicinity. Impacts would be short-lived in any case. The \nmain  effects  of  construction  activities  will  be  disturbance  of  marine  sediments  during \ndriving  of  piles.  This  temporary  disturbance  of  sediments  will  not  have  a  significant \nimpact on the area. However, during this construction stage more congestion than usual \nwill result at the remaining wharves for at least several months. The construction of the \nbeach  ramp  will  also  cause  a  disruption  of  normal  use  of  the  beach  by  dinghies.  This \nproblem can be minimized by completing installation of the pontoon wharf first, which will \nprovide shore access for dinghies while the beach ramp is constructed. Construction of \nthe beach ramp should not take long, in any case. \n \n7. \nAll  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  the \nSanderson subproject are deemed to be insignificant, mostly because of the small scale \nof the subproject and the location in an area with completely dead patches of reef. The \nmain  physical  effects  of  construction  activities  will  be  limited  to  disturbance  of  marine \nsediment  during  driving  of  piles  and  during  dredging  near  the  creek.  This  temporary \ndisturbance  of  sediment  is  not  expected  to  have  much  effect  on  the  project  area. \nHowever,  the  explosion  could  cause  mortality  of  fish  that  may  be  in  Sanderson  Bay  at \nthe  time  of  the  activity.  The  project  design  recommends  a  pile  driver  to  break  up  the \ndead  coral  rubble  and  that  the  rubble  be  dredged  up  and  used  for  fill  at  the  shore \nprotection site. Construction of three small sediment traps in the creek will be required, \nand should be undertaken when flow in the creek is minimal. No significant creek habitat \nwill  be  affected  by  construction  of  the  traps  (most  of  the  creek  is  vegetated  with  grass \nand cluttered with debris). Boat access to the beach at the head of Sanderson Bay will \nbe restricted somewhat during construction of the jetty. Construction of the transit house \nand the terminal will also force people to walk around the site. \n \n8. \nAll  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  the  Daru \nWharf subproject are deemed to be insignificant, mostly because of its small scale and \nthe  absence  of  any  sensitive  coastal  and  terrestrial  habitats  at  the  site.  The  main \nphysical effects of construction activities will be limited disturbance of marine sediment \nduring driving of piles. This temporary disturbance of sediment is not expected to have \nany measurable effect in the area because of strong tidal currents. The small workforce \nrequired during construction will not have any measurable impact on waste inputs to the \narea. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental/ Social Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n\n \n9. \nFew environmental and social problems are anticipated with the operation of the \nVoco  Point  facilities  in  Lae  Harbor,  operation  of  the  jetty  in  Sanderson  Bay,  and \noperation  of  timber  jetty  in  Daru.  The  increased  vessel  and  shore-based  activity \nassociated  with  the  Project  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  vessel  waste,  which  will  require \ntreatment  and  storage  facilities.  Waste  management  strategies  for  the  Voco  Point, \nSanderson  Bay  and  Daru  area  will  include  collection,  storage,  and  disposal  of  all  solid \nwaste from vessels that tie up at the new facilities, and enforcement of regulations that \nspecify  no  bilge  pumping  and  no  tank  flushing  in  the  harbor.  The  risk  of  fuel  spills  will \nalso  increase  with  increased  vessel  activity,  so  fuel  spill  contingency  plans  and \nassociated  training  will  be  specified  in  the  operation  of  the  new  facilities.  Strategies  to \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51\n\nreduce  the  risk  of  fuel  spills  will  include  transfer  of  fuel  only  during  daylight  hours  and \nonly involve vessels tied directly to the wharf. Fuelspill, clean-up equipment, including a \nboom and sorbents, should be provided in a container on the wharf, and dockside staff \ntrained  in  the  deployment  and  use  of  the  equipment.  The  fuelspill  contingency  plan, \nincluding use of the equipment, should be practiced on an annual basis. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional  Requirements,  Required  Studies,  and  Environmental \nMonitoring Program \n\n10. \nThe  responsibility  for  future  environmental  management  of  the  proposed  wharf \nand facilities at these three subproject areas will lie with the National Fisheries Authority, \nin  association  with  the  Harbors  Board.  These  entities  represent  government  interest  in \nthe facilities, and must ensure that the contractor who builds the facilities addresses and \nincorporates  all  the  required  mitigation  measures  that  have  been  specified  in  this \ndocument. The proponent should work with the Office of Environment and Conservation \nto implement the monitoring program. \n \n11. \nThe monitoring will be done at regular intervals. Specific environmental variables, \nwhich  may  be  directly  affected  by  construction  and  operation  of  the  wharf  and  beach \nfacilities will include in situ analysis undertaken on a quarterly basis for measurement of \nhydrocarbons,  nutrients  (ammonia,  nitrates,  phosphate),  dissolved  oxygen,  salinity  and \ntemperature, and suspended particulate matter. \n \nD. \n\nConclusions \n\n12. \nThis  initial  environmental  examination  has  determined  that  the  proposed  wharf \nextension and beach facilities at Voco Point in Lae Harbor and Sanderson Bay, as well \nas  the  construction  of  facilities  in  Daru  can  be  constructed  and  operated  with  no \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. Therefore, no further environmental study or \nenvironmental impact assessment is required. Subject to the implementation of specified \nmitigation  measures  and  environmental  and  social  benefits  monitoring,  the  Project \nshould be able to proceed without any significant negative effects. \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n                                                     K1.00  \n \n      $1.00 \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 21 August 2002) \n \n", "     Currency Unit          \u2013           kina (K) \n", " = \n = \n", "  $0.25880 \n  K3.86399 \n", " \n", " \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nADB \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome   \nAIDS \nFDP \nFisheries Development Project \nHIV               \u2013          human immunodefficiency virus \nNFA \nNFC \nNGO \nO&M \nPIU \nPNG \nSTD \n", "National Fisheries Authority \nNational Fisheries College \nnongovernment organization \n         \u2013          operation and maintenance \n         \u2013          project implementation unit \n", "Papua New Guinea \nsexually transmitted disease \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis  Report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  :  T.
