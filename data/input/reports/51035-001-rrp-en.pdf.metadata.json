The policy-based loan \nwill  support  fiscal  policy,  public  financial  management  (PFM),  and  health  sector  reforms  while \nsafeguarding funding for basic services during a period of fiscal tightening. The project loans fill \ninvestment gaps to support PNG\u2019s progress toward universal health coverage.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDespite  a  period  of  high  economic  growth,  averaging  6%  annually  from  2006  to  2015, \nPNG is in the bottom quartile globally for life expectancy at 65 years and failed to  achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals for maternal and child health.2 The estimated burden of disease \nis  dominated  by  chronic  diseases,  including  strokes  and  heart  disease,  but  also  includes \nconditions  of  poverty  such as  pneumonia and  neonatal  conditions.3 Weak  information  systems \nresult in uncertainty about the leading causes of ill health, which hampers effective priority setting. \nPNG\u2019s  poor  health  outcomes  are  a  result  of  deteriorating  health  care  services  caused  by  a \ncombination  of  volatile  and  unpredictable  health  financing  as  well  as  systemic  weaknesses  in \nregulatory frameworks, government systems, and national and health sector capacities.4  \n \n4. \nA  sharp slowdown in economic growth in 2016 weakened  global  commodity  prices,  on \nwhich  the  PNG\u2019s  economy  is  highly  dependent,  and  underperforming  domestic  resource \nmobilization led to low budget execution rates, i.e., actual health expenditures were 32% lower \nthan budgeted. Overall, health spending accounted for only 10% of total public expenditure and \nremained  37%  below  the  spending  peak  of  2014,  when  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in \nexpectation  of  growing  resource  revenues  had  led  to  significantly  increased  health  financing, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  free  primary  health  care. 5 The  economic  slowdown  constrained \ninvestments in new health infrastructure and reduced the quality of existing service delivery. \n\n \nDeficiencies in health sector governance, including an inconsistent legal framework and \n5. \nfragmented funds flows, undermine service delivery and blur the accountabilities of the various \nstakeholders. Weak PFM, both nationally and in the health sector, further erodes health services. \nA  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  in  2015  highlighted \nweaknesses across the PFM cycle, with major issues in financial controls, accounting, reporting \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.

Strategies  for \nachieving universal health coverage are reflected in the National Health Plan (NHP) 2011\u20132020, \nand policies and standards to support these have been developed.8 Dentralized service delivery \nis supported through the establishment and strengthening of provincial health authorities (PHAs), \na key reform to align rural health and hospital services. More broadly, at the national level the \ngovernment is implementing measures to strengthen policy development and PFM as part of their \nPEFA Road Map, 2015\u20122018.9 \n \n7. \nThe  SDP  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which identifies both the health sector and public sector management \nas  focus  areas  for  investment.10 It  builds  upon  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  in  PNG  in  these \nsectors,  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  health  operations  plan. 11  The  SDP  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  PNG\u2019s  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u20132030  and  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Plan II, 2016\u20132017, thereby benefiting all sectors.12 The medium-term plan links the \nnational budget to the government\u2019s priorities and identifies key reform areas, including (i) PFM \nand  the  development  of  a  medium-term  fiscal  strategy,  (ii)  subnational  service  delivery,  (iii) \ninnovative procurement strategies, and (iv) governance of the national budget process to improve \nallocative efficiency. The SDP will also support key priority areas of the NHP 2011\u20122020, including \nimproving service delivery, and strengthening partnerships and health systems. \n \n8. \nThe  SDP  modality  maximizes  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  by  (i)  combining  critical  reforms  to \nremove bottlenecks in the health service delivery chain and ensuring that resources are available, \nallocated, and used more sustainably and efficiently through a programmatic approach with three \nsubprograms over 2018\u20122020, each financed by a policy-based loan, with (ii) project financing to \n\n                                                \n6 \n\nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  2015.

The  support  by  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  for  domestic \nresource  mobilization  and  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  advice  complements  ADB\u2019s  support. \nAustralia provides support for expenditure and revenue reforms. The PFM working group and the \nquarterly  meetings  of  the  health  development  partners  facilitate  coordination,  while  the  SDP\u2019s \npolicy reform matrix adds value by helping prioritize and align assistance in fiscal policy, PFM, \nand health sector reform across development partners.14 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact of the SDP will be affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health \nservices  for  all  citizens  developed,  in  alignment  with  the  vision  of  the  NHP  2011\u20122020.  The \noutcome will be a more sustainable and efficient health care system achieved.15 \n \nC. \n \nThe SDP will have three outputs, each of which will be achieved through an interconnected \n11. \npolicy-based program and project investment supporting reform and investment from the national \nlevel through to the provincial and district levels. The scope of each is summarized below. The \npolicy matrix is in Appendix 4. All 15 reform actions under subprogram 1 have been completed. \n \n12. \nOutput 1: National frameworks and PFM enhanced. Output 1 will support the long-term \nsustainability and effective use of health sector financing. Under subprogram 1, the policy actions \naddress weaknesses identified in the PEFA assessment and will (i) ensure adequate domestic \nhealth financing within a sustainable overall resource envelope by approving the Medium Term \nFiscal Strategy; (ii) approve an amendment to the Public Finances (Management) Act to expand \ncoverage to statutory authorities such as PHAs; (iii) initiate procurement reforms; (iv) implement \nthe integrated financial management system as the sole system for budgeting, accounting, and \nfinancial  reporting  of  all  public  funds  in  43  national  government  entities  and  five  statutory \nauthorities;  and  (v)  prepare  a  health  system  governance  discussion  paper  on  the  overarching \nregulatory  frameworks  for  the  health  sector  with  recommendations  for  law  reform. 16  Under \nsubprograms 2 and 3, the government will continue to promote fiscal responsibility and safeguard \nhealth sector funding within the medium-term fiscal strategy and the national budget, implement \nbudget  reforms  to  improve  fund  flow  monitoring,  support  the  implementation  of  a  new \nprocurement act, and prepare a consolidated health services and administration law. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n13  The project will finance phase 2 of the Rural Health Project (footnote 11). \n14  Development  Coordination  (accessible  from  the  list of  linked  documents  under  Appendix  2).  The World  Bank  is \nprocessing a development policy operation for late 2018 consideration by the ADB Board of Directors with a likely \nfocus on revenue generation and PFM reform. \n\n15  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16  Links between Public Financial Management Reform Priorities and the Sector Development Program (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nThe project will support the government with the preparation of (i) health service delivery \n13. \ncost  estimates,  to  safeguard  adequate  public  resources  for  the  health  sector;  and  (ii)  the  next \nNHP (2021\u20132030), which will continue the systematic strengthening of the health sector. \n \nOutput  2:  Subnational  health  system  management  strengthened.  Output  2  will \n14. \nsupport  decentralized  health  service  delivery  by  focusing  on  capacity  building  of  staff  in \nmanagement, PFM, and reporting; and contribute to the better alignment of functions, resources, \nand accountability.17 Subprogram 1 policy actions will support the further rollout of the PHA model \nin one province and the direct transfer of consolidated health funding to PHAs. Subprograms 2 \nand  3  will  (i)  continue  the  rollout  of  PHAs,  (ii)  standardize  and  guide  the  management  and \nresponsibility of PHAs, and (iii) continue to support the direct and timely flow of finance from the \nnational  level  to  PHAs.  Strengthened  PHA  capacity  will  enable  better  budgeting  and  stronger \nmonitoring through midyear budget execution reports, in full compliance with PFM frameworks. \n \n15. \nThe project will support the implementation of the integrated public health model that links \ncommunity health posts, health centers, and district hospitals; and provide consulting services to \ncapacity  build  PHAs  through  the  development  of  the  PHA  operations  manual,  to  standardize \nservice delivery, and a suite of development programs. These programs, including leadership and \nmanagement courses, will target all PHA board members, executive district and middle managers, \nclinical  staff,  and  corporate  service  analysts  to  raise  their  skills  and  improve  the  systems  and \nprocesses  of  (i)  corporate  and  clinical  governance;  (ii)  leadership  and  management,  including \nPFM; and (iii) effective use of integrated data in decision making, for better service delivery. PHAs\u2019 \nfinancial management systems will be strengthened, with an intention to integrate them into the \nnational  integrated  financial  management  system.  As  a  result,  PHAs  will  be  able  to  develop \nimproved provincial and district health information profiles, corporate plans and comprehensive \nbudgets,  financial  statements,  and  annual  management  and  performance  reports.  A  PHA \nmonitoring framework will be supported at the Department of Health (DOH). \n \nOutput 3: Health service delivery components strengthened. Output 3 supports the \n16. \neffective delivery of quality health services by investing in NHP priorities for rehabilitating rural \nhealth  care  infrastructure,  improving  the  availability  of  medical  supplies,  building  capacity  for \nclinical governance, supporting new health partnerships, and strengthening information systems \nthrough digitalization. Subprogram 1 policy actions will (i) refine the medical catalogue to facilitate \nprocurement and inventory management, (ii) institutionalize the mSupply18 tender management \nmodule,  and  (iii)  update the  database  of  active health partnerships.  Subprograms  2 and  3 will \ncontinue to reform medical supplies and increasing the use of information systems to increase \naccountability and ultimately improve health service delivery. \n \n17. \nThe project reinforces policy actions by (i) strengthening the procurement and distribution \nof  medicines  providing  benefits  to  the  most  remote  parts  of  the  country;  (ii)  developing  health \nsector  partnerships  across  PHAs,  district  development  authorities,  churches,  and  the  private \nsector  to  ensure  a comprehensive service delivery  framework;  (iii) rolling  out the  digital  health \ninformation system nationally and using its data for decision making; and (iv) upgrading health \nfacilities, which reflects the bulk of the project investment, including at least two district hospitals \nand  six  health  centers  in  accordance  with  the  National  Health  Service  Standards,  which  will \nbenefit more than 250,000 people living in these remote areas. Project activities to complement \ncivil works will include (i) engaging with local communities and provincial and district authorities \nto  support  effective  and  sustainable  transformational  change  in  health  awareness  and  health-\n                                                \n17  Financing the Front Line (accessible from the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). \n18  mSupply  is  a  digital  logistics  system  implemented  in  PNG  with  the  support  of  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS, \n\nTuberculosis and Malaria. \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs, and Investment and Financing Plans \n\nseeking behaviors (e.g., immunization); (ii) training of maternal health workers in project facilities \non essential obstetric care, integrated management of childhood illness, and safe birthing; and (ii) \nother  priority  clinical  upskilling.  The  project  will  also  support  health  facility  management  and \nmaintenance training, and periodic assessment of project facilities to ensure that they continue to \nmeet National Health Service Standards. \n \nD. \n \nThe program considers the government\u2019s financing needs, the availability of alternative \n18. \nfinancing, including the estimated financial support from other  development partners, and debt \nsustainability.19 The  IMF estimates that the government\u2019s  net  borrowing  requirements  between \n2018  and  2020  amount  to  about  $2.4  billion.  The  government  has  requested  $300 million  in \nfinancial assistance in the form of a programmatic approach, comprising three loans from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources of $100 million each for subprograms 1, 2, and 3, to help finance the \nprogram.  The  remaining  gap  will  be  filled  mostly  through  concessional  foreign  borrowings, \nincluding  budget  support  operations  and  project  loans  in  the  pipeline  from  other  development \npartners. The policy-based loan will provide budget financing that enables the continuous funding \nof  essential  health  and  other  basic  services  as  well  as  priority  activities  outlined  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 3). The loan for subprogram 1 will have a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \nloans for subprogram 2 and 3 are in the pipelines for 2019 and 2020, respectively. \n \n19. \nestimates are included in the project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \n\nThe  project  investment  is  estimated  to  cost  $104.5  million  (Table  1).

The DOH will extend the contracts of all PMU staff for \nthe  full  duration  of  the  SDP  project  investment  through  contract  variations  selected  on  Single \nSource Selection. During the overlapping period between the Rural Health Project and the SDP \nproject investment, 80% of the value of the PMU staff contract will continue to be funded by the \nRural Health Project and 20% will be funded under the SDP project investment. All consultants \nwill be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \n23. \nThrough improved health system stewardship, better PFM, and evidence-based planning, \nthe population of PNG (about 8 million) is expected to benefit from the SDP. Direct health facility \nupgrades will benefit at least 250,000 people. \n \nA. \n \nThe  technical  feasibility  was  found  to  be  adequate  after  examination  of  the  project\u2019s \n24. \ncompatibility with local conditions in rural health. Facility design plans prepared under the Rural \nHealth Project incorporate function, engineering, environmental, security, and economic aspects; \nand include infection and fire control, accident prevention, and access ramps. Resource-efficient \nmeasures,  including  solar  panels,  effective  health  care  waste  management  systems,  and \nrainwater capture, will be adopted. The digital health information system is endorsed by DOH as \nthe national information system and will support real-time data collection and report generation. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  majority  of  project  resources  will  be  allocated  to  upgrading \nhealth facilities. Quantified project benefits include (i) greater productivity with reduced incidence \nand severity of illnesses resulting in fewer lost days of work; (ii) productivity gains from reduced \nmortality, particularly among mothers and newborn infants; (iii) improved productivity with fewer \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n21 The PMU is for the project only. The program steering committee will be responsible for implementation of the SDP. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nwork  days  lost  to  caring  for  sick  relatives  and  attending  funerals;  (iv) household  savings  from \nlower  travel  costs;  and  (v)  shorter  waits  for  health  services.  The  proposed  project  yields  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 10.1%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital for \nsocial  sector  and  poverty-targeting  projects  of  6.0%.  The  project  is  considered  economically \nviable. Based on the total disability-adjusted life years lost to the leading childhood and maternal \nillnesses and infectious diseases, the economic losses in 2015 are estimated to be 9.6%\u201319.3% \nof gross national income, which can be interpreted as the upper limit of the impacts of the SDP \nthrough health gains. \n \n26. \nThe  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  for  the  combination  of  reform  measures  is  estimate  at  4.6:1.0. \nSensitivity  analysis  results  confirm  that  the  economic  viability  is  not  particularly  sensitive  to \nunexpected cost escalations. Under stress scenarios regarding realization of quantified benefit \nstreams,  the  economic  viability  is  generally  maintained.  The  main  risk  is  a  scenario  where \nproductivity  gains  are  not  realized  from  reducing  illnesses  following  project  implementation,  a \nhighly  unlikely  scenario.  Efficiency  gains  from  the  combination  of  improvements  to  regulatory \nframeworks  and  systems,  and capacity  development  supported  by the  project  are  expected  to \ngenerate extra fiscal space, which in turn can be channeled toward more productive expenditure. \n \n27. \nFinancial sustainability. The financial analysis demonstrates that the government has \nthe intention and potentially sufficient resources to meet the maintenance needs of at least eight \nupgraded health facilities in the future. Together with commitments to ring-fence funds from the \nDepartment of Treasury (DOT), the capability of provincial governments to maintain the sites and \nallocate financing for operations and maintenance are a determining factor in the finalization of \nfacility locations. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines and identified several financial management risks in staffing, information systems and \nfunds flow. The overall inherent risk was assessed to be substantial, and project risks were also \nassessed to be substantial. Effective mitigation of these risks will be supported by continuing with \nthe demonstrated structures established under the Rural Health Project.22  \n \n29. \nA project procurement risk assessment was undertaken revealing that DOH and provincial \ngovernments are capable of preparing and managing ADB-funded procurements. The larger and \nmore  complex  procurement  under  the  project  will  increase  the  number  of  procurements  and \ncontracts to be managed by the PMU, compared with the Rural Health Project. Adequate PMU \nstaffing  and  the  continuation  of  selected  Rural  Health  Project  PMU  staff  who  have  proven \ntechnical expertise and competencies in procurement will mitigate any risks stemming from this. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith DOT (the executing agency) and the implementing agencies. The policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n \n31. \nHealth-seeking  patterns  are  influenced  by  a  variety  of  factors,  including  availability  of \nmedicines, distance to and cleanliness of health facilities. The expansion of rural health services \nunder the project (with an estimated catchment of 250,000 persons) will support people-centered \nhealth services and improve access by reducing travel time and costs as well as the quality of \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n22  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\ncare,  which  is  critical  according  to  the  conducted  poverty  and  social  assessment,  whereby \ncommunities stressed the importance of proximity because of cultural and cost considerations. \nThe upgrade of health facilities will also create 200 temporary jobs. Selection of health facilities \nto be upgraded will be on the basis of a transparent selection criteria to be defined by the Project \nSteering Group which will continue under the PMU (para 22).  \n \n32. \nGender. Women and children typically access health services more than men. The project \nis categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared and agreed \nwith the government.23 Key gender features include establishing gender-friendly health facilities, \nupskilling  the  health workforce  on reproductive health and  maternal  health,  training  in gender-\nbased budgeting, and implementing sex-disaggregated reporting. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nEnvironment. The project is category B for environment. An environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  and  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), was prepared. The project will include small-scale physical works on \nexisting  health  facility  sites  and  is  not  anticipated  to  have  significant  or  irreversible  negative \nenvironmental  impacts. The  anticipated  impacts and risks  are  localized, small-scale,  and most \nwill occur during the construction stage and can be readily mitigated with measures set out in the \nEMP. Some operational environmental impacts are anticipated, including solid and medical waste, \nwastewater,  noise,  fugitive  dust,  and  occupational  health  and  safety.  These  environmental \nimpacts are anticipated to be minor and will be managed through the conventional operation and \nmaintenance  practices,  health  and  safety  codes,  and  health  care  waste  management  that  are \nincluded  in  the  EMP.  The  project  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  resolve \ncomplaints or issues. The capacity of implementing agency will be built to carry out environmental \nsafeguard  and  compliance  measures,  along  with  capacity  to  manage  related  risks  and \nimplementation of the environmental assessment and review framework. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is category C for involuntary resettlement. It is not \nexpected to cause any physical or economic displacements as it will involve upgrades of existing \nhealth infrastructure on government-owned or church-leased land. A resettlement framework was \nprepared for unanticipated impacts, and due diligence for the first proposed subproject confirm \nthat it is located on government-owned land and will not require land acquisition or resettlement. \nNo involuntary resettlement impact is associated with the policy actions under the program. All \nkey stakeholders were consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. \n \n35. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is category C for indigenous peoples. It is not expected \nto  impact  any  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The subprojects will not require an indigenous peoples plan, but will ensure \nthat  the  local  communities  actively  participate  and  receive  culturally  appropriate  benefits.  No \nindigenous people impacts are associated with the policy actions under the project. \n \nF. \n \n36. \nThe overall risk is substantial, but manageable when applying the mitigating measures. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  Major risks and mitigating \nmeasure  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan (footnote 22). \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n23  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nMacroeconomic \n\nWeak governance \nand sustainability of \nreforms \n\nWeak PFM and \ninsufficient \nresources for O&M \nLack of \ntransparency in \nprocurement and \noperations, and \nweak accounting \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRating \n\nMitigating Measures \nPolicy reforms supported through the three subprograms will trigger the release of \nbudget support funds that will help ease the foreign exchange imbalance. \n\nHigh \n\nSubstantial  DOT committed to ring-fencing resources for the health sector and improving \n\nsustainability of financing under the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy. Institutional \nand governance reforms will be accelerated through policy actions, and project \ntraining will clarify mandates and accountabilities, determine O&M requirements, \nand build capacity for asset management.  \n\nSubstantial  Policy actions will contribute to allocative and technical efficiency, funds flow \n(including counterpart financing), and PFM improvements that will prioritize, \nchannel and efficiently use resources for O&M at the PHA and facility levels. \n\nSubstantial  The PMU will assist DOH and the PHAs with procurement activities and ensure \n\nthat evaluation committees adhere to the required standard. Continuity of \nconsultants in the PMU (experts continuing on from RPHSDP) with demonstrated \nresults in compliance with procurement processes and auditing will assist DOH \nand PHAs in maintaining a high degree of compliance and efficiency.  \n\nDOH = Department of Health,  DOT = Department of Treasury, O&M = operation and maintenance,  PHA = provincial \nhealth authority, PFM = public financial management, PMU = project management unit, RPHSDP = Rural Primary Health \nServices Delivery Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n37. \nThe  government  and  DOT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  SDP  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
