THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support (HEALS) \nProgram under the Countercyclical Support Facility coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nresponse option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The Samoa HEALS Program is part of an integrated package of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) support to help the country\u2019s short-term efforts to mitigate the severe socioeconomic \nimpacts and manage potential health impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Samoa \nHEALS  Program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  addressing \nremaining  poverty  and reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in gender  equality,  and \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 It is consistent with the objective of directing \nconcessional finance to the most vulnerable developing member countries. It is aligned with the \nPacific Approach priority of managing risks and building resilience by strengthening the health \nsector and social protection.3 Samoa meets all access criteria of the CPRO (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n#  Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact of  Growth in Samoa is projected to fall to \u20135.0% in FY2020 and \u20132.0% in FY2021 \nexogenous shock  (compared with pre\u2013COVID-19 projections of 3.5% and 2.7%) as a result of the \npandemic. Risks are significant on the downside, depending on the duration of the \npandemic. The fiscal deficit as a share of GDP is projected to be 7.3% in FY2020 and \n9.8% in FY2021 (compared with pre\u2013COVID-19 projections of 1.2% and 2.0%) and the \ncurrent account deficit as a share of GDP is projected to be 7.1% in FY2020 and 7.0% \nin FY2021 (compared with pre\u2013COVID-19 projections of 3.0% and 0.8%). Rising \nunemployment (more than 16.0% of jobs lost by FY2021) and poverty (from 13.4% to \n21.7% of households) are expected in the absence of adequate countercyclical support.  \n2.  Countercyclical  The  government  has  announced  a  comprehensive  pro-poor  stimulus  program \ndevelopment  comprising two packages: the first worth $24.8 million (3.1% of GDP) for FY2020 and the \nexpenditures  second worth $31.1 million (3.8% of GDP) for FY2021. The government program \nincludes measures to strengthen the health sector response, and support livelihoods \n(especially for vulnerable groups) and adversely affected sectors (particularly hospitality).  \n3.  Pre-shock record of  Before  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Samoa  was  implementing  a  sound  budgetary \ngenerally sound  framework. From an overall fiscal balance of \u20135.4% of GDP in FY2014 (largely due to \neconomic  reconstruction expenditures following Cyclone Evan in FY2013), Samoa recorded a fiscal \nmanagement  surplus of 2.7% of GDP in FY2019. Expenditures were controlled after the FY2014 spike, \ncoming down from 43.3% of GDP to 31.2% in FY2019. Revenues rose, helped by \nimproved domestic resource mobilization efforts, with tax revenues rising steadily since \nFY2016. From 54.9% of GDP in FY2015, external debt came down to 46.9% in FY2019, \nas the government relied primarily on grant assistance and reduced fiscal deficits. The \ncurrent account balance improved from \u20138.1% of GDP in FY2014 to 2.3% in FY2019. \n4.  Structural reforms  Strong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented \na COVID-19 outbreak. Samoa has been under a state of emergency since 20 March \n2020. The  Health  Emergency  Operations  Center  operational plan  has  laid out  a \npandemic preparedness and management plan. A national sector preparations and \nresponse  matrix  against  COVID-19  has  been  prepared,  outlining  actions  for  14 \nministries. \n5.  Debt sustainability  Samoa was already at high risk of debt distress before the pandemic on account of its \nvulnerability and narrow economic base. Following the pandemic, debt will remain \nsustainable over the long run although still at high risk. The CPRO grant will help debt \nsustainability since it can substitute for potentially higher-cost borrowing to finance fiscal \ndeficits. The government is accessing grants from partners to finance its FY2020 and \nFY2021 fiscal deficits to keep debt below 50% of GDP. \n \n1 ADB. 2020.

Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Samoa is a small island country in the South Pacific, with a population of about 202,500 \nand an area of 2,842 square kilometers. It is vulnerable to frequent disasters caused by natural \nhazards.4 It is one of about a dozen countries worldwide that have yet to confirm a COVID-19 \ncase.  Despite  avoiding  direct  COVID-19  effects,  Samoa  is  expected  to  suffer  economic \ncontraction in FY2020\u2013FY2021, with adverse socioeconomic impacts.  \n \n4.  Health sector challenges. Samoa\u2019s health care system lacks the capacity to cope with \nan  outbreak  of  COVID-19.  Given  the  high  prevalence  of  hypertension,  diabetes,  and \ncardiovascular diseases, Samoans are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19.5 Despite \nreceiving  test  cartridges  for  COVID-19,  the  country\u2019s  laboratory  capacity  still  needs  to  be \nstrengthened for local testing, and Samoa remains dependent on overseas COVID-19 testing. \nSamoa has only 0.34 physicians, 1.90 nurses, and 1.25 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and \nexisting capacity could easily be overwhelmed in case of an outbreak. There are two referral \nhospitals, six rural district hospitals, and five community health centers in the country. Primary \nhealth facilities are understaffed. Ventilators, quarantine and intensive care facilities, and personal \nprotective equipment for health care workers and patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are \ninadequate. \n \n5.  Measles outbreak. A measles outbreak in the second half of 2019, narrowly preceding \nthe global COVID-19 pandemic, put significant pressure on the health care system.6 The outbreak \nresulted in more than 5,700 cases and 83 deaths, mostly children below 5. The government \ndeclared a state of emergency from 17 November to 28 December 2019. By December, a \nvaccination drive had brought the vaccination rate to more than 90% and controlled the outbreak.  \n \n6.  Measures  to  prevent  and  control  COVID-19.  In  view  of  these  constraints  and \nexperiences, the government took decisive and proactive actions to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak \n(Table 2). Samoa was among the first countries to impose 14-day self-quarantine measures for \ntravelers from COVID-19\u2013affected economies and implement other travel restrictions. A state of \nemergency, declared on 20 March 2020, remains in effect, along with several social distancing \nmeasures. All international travel is suspended, except with Cabinet approval.   \n \n4  Recent disasters include a tsunami in FY2009, Cyclone Evan in FY2013, and Cyclone Gita in FY2018.  \n5  Lifestyle-related factors, including high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, dietary habits, and high blood \npressure, have resulted in a growing burden of noncommunicable diseases. World Health Organization. 2018. Global \nHealth Estimates 2016: Disease Burden by Cause, Age, Sex, by Country and by Region, 2000\u20132016. Geneva. \n6  The measles vaccination rates for babies below 1 year fell from almost 75% in 2017 to below a third in 2018. In July \n2018, two infants died in Samoa after receiving vaccinations against measles, mumps, and rubella, raising local fears \nover the vaccine itself and contributing to the sharp decline in vaccination rates. The deaths were later established \nto have been caused by the nurses mixing the vaccine with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water. \n ", "3 \nTable 2: Timeline of Key Measures \n#  Date  Measures \n1.  27 January   Compulsory screening of passengers through special health declaration forms. Travelers \nfrom countries with active cases to be examined by medical practitioner at least 3 days \nbefore  travelling  to  Samoa.  Travelers  originating from  or  transiting  through  mainland \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China to spend at least 14 days in self-quarantine at the country of last \nport that is free of the coronavirus disease. \n2.  13 February  Advisory issued to airlines to disallow boarding for passengers without adequate screening. \n3.  22 February  All cruise ships banned. \n4.  29 February  International flights severely restricted. \n5.  19 March  All incoming passengers (including citizens) to undergo medical check-up on entry. \n6.  20 March  State of emergency declared, with social distancing measures.  \n7.  21 March  National Emergency Operations Centre activated. \n8.  22 March  Suspension of flights from Australia, further restrictions on flights from New Zealand. \n9.  23 March  Health Emergency Operations Center operational plan activated.  \n10.  25 March  Fines announced for individuals and businesses breaching quarantine restrictions. \n11.  26 March  Fishing boats banned, only cargo ships allowed entry. International airport closed.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank, based on announcements by the Government of Samoa. \n \n7.  A Health Emergency Operations Center operational plan was activated in March to \nimprove preparedness and planning.7 The Ministry of Health is the lead agency for the COVID-\n19 response. The plan lays out (i) hospital protocols specifying functions and operations of various \ndepartments to handle COVID-19 and non\u2013COVID-19 patients separately; (ii) arrangements for \nprocurement and handling of resources and equipment; (iii) human resource arrangements, \nspecifying  functions  of  doctors,  nurses,  and  surveillance  staff,  and  responsibilities  for \ncommunications and border oversight; and (iv) COVID-19 briefing and reporting arrangements. \nCall center facilities have been established for the public to contact the Ministry of Health.  \n \n8.  With support from the international community, Samoa has obtained medical equipment \nthat can help in COVID-19 screening and control. The World Health Organization, and bilateral \ndevelopment partners, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand the United States, have provided assistance in the form of  infrared thermometers for \nscreening at ports of entry and health care facilities, personal protective equipment to prevent \ntransmission, and ventilators for patients requiring intensive care.  \n \n9.  Pre\u2013COVID-19  sound  macroeconomic  management.  The  IMF  noted  that  despite \nconfronting several economic challenges and frequent shocks, Samoa has proved its resilience \nby pushing through needed economic reforms.8 From a fiscal deficit of 5.3% of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  in  FY2014  largely  caused  by  financing  of  Cyclone  Evan  reconstruction, \nexpenditure controls and growing revenues (aided by strong own-tax performance) led to a fiscal \nsurplus of 2.7% of GDP in FY2019. The external debt\u2013GDP ratio broadly trended downward in \nthe same period as fiscal deficits fell, and was 46.9% in FY2019\u2014below the authorities\u2019 ceiling of \n50.0%.9 The current account balance similarly improved from a deficit of 8.1% of GDP in FY2014 \nto a small surplus of 2.3% in FY2019, aided by growing remittance receipts and strong tourism \nearnings. GDP growth in FY2019 was 3.5%, underpinned by good performance in tourism, \nremittances, and construction (for the Pacific Games in July 2019), as the economy recovered \nfrom a contraction in FY2018 caused by the twin impacts of the closure of a large automotive \nparts manufacturing firm and Cyclone Gita. Banking system indicators were sound, with declining \nnonperforming loan ratios (7.1% in FY2015 to 3.9% in FY2019) and adequate liquidity. \n \n7 Government of Samoa, Ministry of Health. 2020. Health Emergency Operations Center Operational Plan. Apia.  \n \n8 IMF. 2020. Samoa: Staff Concluding Statement of the 2020 Article IV Mission. Washington, DC.  \n \n9  Public external debt increased from 50% of GDP in FY2016 to 52% in FY2018, partly because Samoa could not \naccess exclusive grant funding from the International Development Association and ADB in 2015 and 2016. \n ", "4 \n10.  The pre\u2013COVID-19 outlook for Samoa was healthy, with downside risks.10 Growth of 3.5% \nwas projected for FY2020, with tourism expected to remain strong. A fiscal deficit of 1.2% of GDP \nwas budgeted for FY2020, within the government\u2019s indicative ceiling of 2.0%. High earnings from \ntourism and remittances were expected to lead to a current account surplus of 3.0% of GDP. \nSlowdown in tourism and vulnerability to external shocks were seen as key risks. \n \n11.  Measles outbreak impacts. Samoa performed strongly in the first quarter of FY2020. \nThe Pacific Games led to visitor arrivals growing by 15.8% year-on-year, which contributed to real \nGDP growth of 5.2% year-on-year. The situation changed in the second quarter of FY2020 \nbecause of the economic decline resulting largely from the 6-week state of emergency declared \nto control the measles outbreak (para. 5). Visitor arrivals declined 11.3% year-on-year and growth \nwas \u20133.7% year-on-year, the lowest quarterly outturn in six successive quarters. The economy \nwas already under stress when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the third quarter of FY2020.  \n \n12.  Key channels for COVID-19 impacts. The pandemic is leading to significant adverse \nsocioeconomic consequences for Samoa through several channels:  \n(i)  Tourism. The contraction in visitor arrivals, which peaked at more than 178,500 \narrivals  in  FY2019,  will  have  major  socioeconomic  impacts.  Assuming  travel \nrestrictions are in place until December 2020, visitor arrivals could plummet to \nabout 38,500 in FY2021, with the contribution of tourism receipts to GDP also \nexpected to fall significantly from 23.1% in FY2019 to about 5.2% in FY2021 \n(Figure 1). This will negatively impact the performance of allied sectors such as \nrestaurants, accommodation, transport, and commerce, which together account \nfor about a third of employment. Foreign exchange inflows will also fall. \n \nFigure 1: Visitor Arrivals and Tourism Receipts \n200 25 T\no\nu\n)s0 160 20 msir\n001( slav 120 15 stpiecer \nirra 80 10 %( \n rotis 40 5 G fo \niV D\n0 0 P\n)\nFY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 FY2020p FY2021p\nVisitor arrivals (lhs) Tourism receipts (as % of GDP, rhs)\n \nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, lhs = left-hand scale, p = projections, rhs = right-hand scale. \nSource: Asian Development Bank, and Central Bank of Samoa estimates.  \n \n(ii)  Remittances. Remittances (23.4% of FY2019 GDP) are projected to decline by \nalmost 10% in FY2020, as seasonal overseas workers\u2014more than 2,500 of whom \nwork in Australia and New Zealand every year\u2014are affected by travel restrictions. \nSince more than 80% of remittances are through money transfer operators, loss \nof the operators\u2019 correspondent banking relations in a tightening global regulatory \nlandscape could further disrupt remittances. This will lead to lower consumption \ndemand, particularly for vulnerable households that depend on remittance income, \nand declining foreign exchange earnings.  \n \n10  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019 Update: Fostering Growth and Inclusion in Asia\u2019s Cities. Manila.  \n ", "5 \n(iii)  Trade. Samoa\u2019s merchandise trade will suffer as tighter regulations on shipping \nand border closures hamper the flow of goods. Supply chain disruptions and lower \ndemand from tourism-related businesses will lead to imports (41.1% of FY2019 \nGDP), including food and fuel, declining by FY2021. Exports (5.8% of FY2019 \nGDP) are expected to contract by about 10% in FY2020 as key export partners \nenter recession. Restrictions could weaken small export-oriented agribusiness \nindustries, which support employment and income of many smallholders.  \n(iv)  Construction. Construction, which makes up about 6%\u20137% of GDP and supports \nabout 7% of jobs, will be cut in half in FY2020. Some decline was to be expected \nwith  the  completion  of  projects  related  to  hosting  the  2019  Pacific  Games. \nRestrictions  on  international  travel  prevent  movement  of  foreign  consultants, \ncontractors, and engineers (who are important for major infrastructure projects), \nand hamper imports of required construction equipment and materials.  \n \n13.  Economic impacts. These developments will translate into significant impacts on the \neconomy. GDP growth in FY2020 is projected to be \u20135.0% (Figure 2). Development partners have \na consensus on FY2020 growth, with the IMF and the World Bank also projecting a 5.0% \ncontraction. Opinion varies on FY2021 growth, depending on the expected length of lockdown \nand the timing of the projections. The World Bank projects no growth in FY202111 and the IMF \nprojects a 1.5% contraction.12 ADB projects a 2.0% contraction in FY2021, in line with government \nestimates, assuming restrictions until December 2020, followed by cautious reopening.13  \n \nFigure 2: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth Rates, Pre\u2013 and Post\u2013COVID-19 \n%\nPost\u2013COVID Pre\u2013COVID Historical\n8\n4\n0\n-4 CycloneEvan  Cyclone Gita, and \nGlobal financial closure of Yazaki\n-8 crisis, and tsunami  manufacturing plant  COVID-19pandemic\n8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 p p p\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y 2 2 2\nF F F F F F F F F F F F Y Y Y\nF F F  \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, p = projections. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n14.  Significant fiscal pressures will lead to urgent financing needs. Compared with pre\u2013\nCOVID-19 estimates of fiscal deficit\u2013GDP ratios of 1.2% in FY2020 and 2.0% in FY2021, post\u2013\nCOVID-19 estimates have gone up to 7.3% and 9.8% respectively (Table 3). The directly affected \nsectors have multiple linkages to the rest of the economy; in addition to being employment-\nintensive, they contribute tax revenue and convertible currency. The fiscal impacts will include \nforegone revenues from tourism royalties, visa fees, import duty concessions for essentials, and \nborder taxes. The stimulus program to protect vulnerable groups and affected private sector \nenterprises will cause total expenditures to rise.  \n \n11 World Bank. 2020.

Samoa. Request for Disbursement under the Rapid \nCredit Facility\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Samoa. IMF Country Report \nNo. 20/138. Washington, DC. \n \n15.  The current account deficit\u2013GDP ratio is projected to widen to 7.1% in FY2020 and 7.0% \nin FY2021, largely because of declining tourism and remittances, compared with pre\u2013COVID-19 \nprojections of 3.0% and 0.8% in surpluses.14 This could push official foreign reserves from 6.6 \nmonths of import cover in March 2020 to 2.9 months by FY2021. This is below the IMF-\nrecommended 5 months of import cover and poses risks due to Samoa\u2019s import dependence. \nInflation is expected to rise in Samoa with global supply chain disruptions. Despite declining global \ncommodity and oil prices and weakening domestic demand, the IMF projects consumer price \nindex inflation to average 2.8% in FY2020 and 2.5% in FY2021, marginally higher than pre\u2013\nCOVID-19 projections of 2.0% in FY2020 and 1.9% in FY2021.  \n \n16.  Samoa\u2019s banking indicators are generally sound, with sufficient liquidity. Nonperforming \nloans are 3.9% of total loans and banks have provisions for them. Loan defaults are imminent as \nprivate sector activity contracts and incomes fall due to COVID-19 impacts. More than 70% of \noutstanding credit is for sectors directly affected by COVID-19: 32% for construction, 13% for \ntrade, and about 25% for other services (including tourism). While no significant impacts are seen \nyet, the financial sector could come under pressure through loan defaults and financial soundness \nindicators could breach macroprudential thresholds.  \n \n17.  Social impacts. The pandemic will have profound social impacts. About 41,500 Samoans \nwere working in FY2017, of whom 37.2% were in the informal sector.15 By FY2021, more than \n8,000 Samoans could lose their jobs, mainly in tourism and allied sectors. ADB estimates that \nabout 30% of job losses could be women.16 The percentage of households living below the \nnational basic needs poverty line could go up from 13.4% to 21.7% due to the pandemic.17 Poorer \nhouseholds could be hit hard by the decline in remittances. The elderly, disabled, and those with \npre-existing health conditions will be more vulnerable because of COVID-19 impacts on access \nto basic and essential services. Social protection programs are limited. A universal pension \nscheme for people over 65 provides monthly payments, plus free health care in public hospitals \n \n14 ADB. 2019.

The  government  provides  disability \nassistance through grants and subsidies to special education programs. The Samoa National \nProvident Fund (SNPF) is mandatory for formal workers and voluntary for informal workers. The \ncountry has no unemployment benefit schemes.  \n \n18.  Gender impacts. Women will be affected through increased risk of infection to frontline \nhealth workers, job and income losses, and intimate partner violence. Based on the latest \navailable data, 10.2% of female-headed households are vulnerable to slipping into basic needs \npoverty compared with 7.8% of male-headed households (footnote 17). Fewer women are \nemployed than men in the formal sector, resulting in disproportionately more men getting social \nsecurity benefits covering the formal sector.18 Women are more likely to work in wholesale and \nretail trade (which is affected by the economic downturn) and in public administration. Micro \nbusinesses make up 80% of the private sector, and 40% of them are headed by women. About \n33% of women in business obtained bank loans, while the rest rely on family savings or a partner\u2019s \nincome.19 Interest rates charged by microfinance facilities tend to be high.  \n \n19.  Downside risks to outlook. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be \nprotracted, and lockdowns and restrictions could continue well into FY2021 or even beyond until \nan effective COVID-19 vaccination is developed and distributed. This could lead to more severe \nsocioeconomic impacts than described. An outbreak of COVID-19 or a major disaster caused by \nnatural hazards (which hits Samoa every 4 or 5 years) could be devastating.  \n \n20.  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  response.  The  government  has  formulated  a \ncomprehensive countercyclical response program to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 \n(paras. 21\u201324).20 The government program comprises two fiscal stimulus packages: one for \nST66.3 million ($24.8 million) as an FY2020 supplementary budget and another for ST83.1 million \n($31.1 million) as part of the FY2021 budget. The government program aims to (i) safeguard \nlivelihoods and purchasing power of citizens, (ii) support productive sectors, and (iii) strengthen \nthe health sector (Table 4). Given data and information constraints and significant informal \nemployment, the risks of exclusion of vulnerable people are high, prompting a blanket extension \nof relief for some interventions. The government has considered the special needs of women and \nvulnerable groups in its response (paras. 38\u201339). \n \nTable 4: Samoa\u2019s Countercyclical Response Program \nItem  FY2020 Package  FY2021 Package \nSafeguarding livelihoods and purchasing power of citizens   ST33.5 million  ST67.6 million \nSupporting productive sectors  ST12.5 million  ST10.6 million \nStrengthening the health sector  ST20.3 million  ST4.9 million \nTotal  ST66.3 million  ST83.1 million \nNote: The health sector response in the stimulus program excludes ST120.6 million to the Ministry of Health under the \nFY2021 budget appropriations for individual ministries.  \nSource: ADB estimates, based on Government of Samoa announcements.  \n \n21.  Safeguarding livelihoods and purchasing power of citizens. Under the government\u2019s \ncountercyclical response program, the SNPF has announced a one-time special dividend for its \n85,000 members, which includes formal and informal workers. A one-time ST400 special pension \nhas been added to the elderly pension scheme (para. 17), and the pension has been increased \n \n18 Labor force participation rates are 31.5% for women and 55.0% for men, and unemployment rates are 20.0% for \nwomen and 7.5% for men (footnote 15). \n19 ADB. 2015. Promoting Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment. Consultant\u2019s Report. Manila (TA-6143 REG). \n20  A supplementary budget of ST23.6 million (1.1% of GDP) approved in December 2019 in response to the measles \noutbreak included ST12.4 million for the Ministry of Health and to cover expenses for measles eradication. \n ", "8 \nby ST15 a month. The prices of electricity and water have been reduced until December 2020 for \nhouseholds and several commercial businesses, with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) carrying the \nbulk of the costs. A one-off cash transfer of ST50 is provided for all Samoans. Unemployment \nbenefits will be provided for 3,000\u20136,500 Samoans.21 Special paid training has been set up for up \nto 2,000 workers laid off in the hospitality and allied sectors.22 The SNPF has allowed contributors \nrendered unemployed in the hospitality industry to withdraw 20% of their contributions. The \nSamoa Housing Corporation has provided a 3-month moratorium on loan repayments. Import \nduty on specific food essentials identified by the MOF has been reduced.  \n \n22.  The government has committed that all public servants will remain employed and that \npublic service recruitment will be fast-tracked. Free health care for senior citizens and children \nbelow 15 and free maternal health care will continue without reductions. In view of import \nrestrictions arising from border closures, the government is enhancing food security through \nsupport for taro, cocoa, coconut, fruit, and vegetable growers; waiver of licensing fees for \ndomestic fishing vessels until December 2020; and employment of laid-off workers for land \nclearing and planting. Ongoing government projects, including developments for roads and water, \nwill continue to ensure incomes for workers.  \n \n23.  Supporting productive sectors. Rent-free operations for businesses and for about 4,000 \nmarket vendors are allowed from April to August 2020 on property owned by the government. \nThe Development Bank of Samoa has set up special credit facilities for working capital for small \nbusinesses affected by COVID-19.23 The Women in Business Development Program will support \nsustainable businesses using farm-based resources run by women. The government will provide \nfunding of ST0.85 million to support female artisans (para. 39). Payments to the SNPF and the \nAccident Compensation Corporation are frozen for 6 months for the hospitality sector and 2 \nmonths for other sectors. The electricity usage rate for hotels is reduced significantly until \nDecember, to support the hospitality industry. The government is carrying 3 months of loan \nrepayments  for  all  small  businesses  under  its  Government  Guarantee  Schemes.  Partial \ncompensation is being provided to exporters for lost exports (agriculture and fishing).  \n \n24.  Strengthening the health sector. Samoa will continue to prepare for COVID-19, guided \nby  the  Health  Emergency  Operations  Center  operational  plan  (para.  7).  Funds  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s  stimulus  program  will  help  upgrade  isolation  rooms  in  hospitals  (including  a \nnegative pressure room to prevent cross-contamination), strengthen quarantine facilities and \nlaboratory capacity for local testing, and procure medical supplies and consumables. At least 100 \nfrontline health workers will receive training on infection prevention control, contact tracing, and \nrisk  communication,  such  as  limiting  exposure  of  vulnerable  groups  to  nonemergency \nconsultations. These measures will be particularly important as Samoa reopens borders. All \nfrontline  health  workers  at  Samoa\u2019s  two  referral  hospitals  will  receive  personal  protective \nequipment appropriate for COVID-19. Each of 365 village women\u2019s committees will receive \nST3,600 to promote rural health and sanitation practices (para. 39). Risk benefits in case of \nCOVID-19 infection or death will be earmarked for frontline health workers, up to 1 year\u2019s salary.  \n \n25.  Financial sector measures. In addition to the fiscal stimulus measures, the Central Bank \nof Samoa is committed to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance and providing \n \n21 The benefits will use existing payroll for those who remain employed and individual bank accounts or direct claims \nfor those who have lost their jobs. Beneficiaries will register themselves as affected workers, to be vetted by the \nChamber of Commerce and relevant industry groups. \n22 Affected workers will self-enroll to avail themselves of customized training on hospitality and services by the Australia \nPacific Training Coalition and Samoa Tourism Authority. \n23 The facilities will support activities such as indigenous handicrafts and organic farming.  \n ", "9 \nliquidity to support the private sector. The Central Bank of Samoa is engaging weekly with the \nCommercial Banks Association to ensure the soundness of the banking system in view of current \nand future disruptions to economic activities, reflect changes in loan classification and resulting \nlosses in a timely and reliably manner, and provide guidelines on prudent loan restructuring. To \nmonitor local inflation and prevent price gouging, the government has revived the Price Control \nBoard to enforce a price ceiling for preselected necessities during the state of emergency. \n \nB.  Proposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n26.  Proposed program. The Samoa HEALS Program will help the government implement its \ncountercyclical COVID-19 stimulus expenditures. It will support relief measures for vulnerable \ngroups and economic stimulus measures for productive sectors. It will provide the government \nwith the fiscal space to meet critical public health needs while managing the economic downturn.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The Samoa HEALS Program builds on a strong base of country \nknowledge and relationships. In the past, ADB has supported emergency response, infrastructure, \npublic sector management, and health. 24 ADB has advised the authorities on the stimulus \nprogram, particularly on formulating pro-poor responses that empower women. ADB has provided \ntechnical assistance through a rapid social assessment to understand the gender-differentiated \nsocioeconomic impacts of the pandemic on the poor and vulnerable and collect baseline data.25 \nFurther advisory assistance will be provided to implement the stimulus program, monitor the \nimpacts on vulnerable groups (including women), and design additional measures as needed.26 \n \n28.  The Samoa HEALS Program is part of an integrated package of ADB assistance that \ncovers  immediate  response  to  COVID-19,  short-term  response  to  manage  adverse \nsocioeconomic impacts, and medium-term response to promote recovery and resilience. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the pandemic, Samoa drew down $2.9 million in grants from the Pacific \nDisaster Resilience Program for contingent disaster financing.27 ADB is collaborating with the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) on the procurement of essential medical equipment \nand supplies.28 In the short term, the government\u2019s response to manage the socioeconomic \nimpact is supported by the Samoa HEALS Program. An Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund \ngrant is also under discussion. In the medium term, ADB will support the health sector (including \nin  the  context  of  safe reopening  of  borders  and  reviving  tourism),29 improve  public  sector \nmanagement,  promote  state-owned  enterprise  reforms,  and  boost  disaster  resilience.  The \ncontingent disaster financing, which has been drawn down, will be replenished and support \nreforms to strengthen disaster resilience. ADB will build the government\u2019s capacity to further \nreinforce the design and targeting of safety nets for the poor and vulnerable, including women \n(footnote 25). Proposed infrastructure projects in the pipeline will assist recovery, with priority \ngiven to local contractors to create jobs. \n \n24 Through  policy-based  lending,  ADB  has  supported  state-owned  enterprise  reforms,  procurement  and  debt \nmanagement, and resilience to climate change.

Development partner coordination. ADB has coordinated with partners to ensure a \ntimely and substantial response, building on lessons from past engagement.30 Dialogue between \npartners has been facilitated since 2009 by the joint policy action matrix process, which brings \ntogether ADB, the World Bank, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand to support \nSamoa\u2019s reform program. ADB\u2019s Pacific Country Office in Apia has participated formally and \ninformally in development partner coordination meetings. ADB participated in the IMF\u2019s Article IV \nmeetings in Apia in February 2020, and has coordinated with the IMF on post\u2013COVID-19 key \nmacroeconomic projections through regular dialogue and sharing of information. An IMF Rapid \nCredit Facility staff report was provided in lieu of an assessment letter (footnote 12).31 \n \n30.  To support the implementation of Samoa\u2019s first stimulus package worth $24.8 million in \nFY2020, the World Bank provided $5.1 million in grants in March 2020 from its Catastrophe \nDeferred Drawdown Option and approved another $3.4 million in grants in April 2020 through an \nemergency health project.32 ADB contributed $2.9 million in grants in April 2020 (para. 28). Budget \nsupport and/or support to improve preparedness and response estimated at $4.3 million in grants \nhave been provided by the governments of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; the World Health Organization; several United Nations agencies; and the \nEuropean Union.33 The IMF approved $22.03 million from the Rapid Credit Facility in April 2020 \nas balance of payments support to the Central Bank of Samoa.34 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reforms \n \n31.  The Samoa HEALS Program is aligned with the following impacts: (i) effective and \ncollective health response to the COVID-19 pandemic ensured (footnote 7), and (ii) an improved \nquality of life for all.35 The effect of the Samoa HEALS Program will be adverse effects of COVID-\n19 on citizens and businesses mitigated. This will be achieved through (i) incomes of citizens, \nparticularly vulnerable groups, safeguarded; (ii) productive sectors supported; and (iii) COVID-19 \ninfection prevention, preparedness, and control strengthened. Specific measures are aligned with \nthe government\u2019s comprehensive countercyclical response program (paras. 21\u201324).36  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n \n32.  Financing needs. The government\u2019s financing needs will increase by $64.7 million in \nFY2021 due to COVID-19. ADB\u2019s $20 million CPRO will cover 24.5% of the projected FY2021 \nfinancing need of $81.4 million. The Samoa HEALS Program focuses largely on supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s second stimulus package (para. 20), although ongoing measures from the first \npackage are also included. The government plans to seek additional grants from development \npartners, including policy-based grants that the World Bank and the governments of Australia and \nNew Zealand are planning for FY2021 (Table 5). The government will seek additional project \ngrants from bilateral partners. In the absence of sufficient grants to cover FY2021 development \nfinancing needs, the government plans to reprioritize budgeted non-stimulus expenditures or rely \non domestic resource efforts (including direct assistance from public bodies and state-owned \n \n30 Development coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n31 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Samoa. Request for Disbursement under \nthe Rapid Credit Facility\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the Executive Director for Samoa. IMF \nCountry Report No. 20/138. Washington, DC. \n \n33.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the Program. The grant proceeds will \nsupport development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.37  \n \n34.  Debt sustainability. Samoa was at high risk of debt distress before COVID-19 because \nof its vulnerability to disasters, but the debt was considered sustainable.38 A post\u2013COVID-19 IMF \ndebt  sustainability  assessment  finds  that  external  debt  continues  to  be  at  high  risk,  and \nsustainable over 20 years, even with financing of fiscal deficits through concessional loans \n(footnote 12).39 Maintaining the indicative deficit target at 1% of GDP on average starting FY2023, \nand below the authorities\u2019 2% annual deficit ceiling over the medium term, while seeking external \ngrants to finance development, can lower the debt\u2013GDP trajectory. ADB\u2019s assessment confirms \nthat Samoa\u2019s debt will remain sustainable following COVID-19.40 Since the government is seeking \ngrants to finance fiscal deficits, Samoa\u2019s debt\u2013GDP trajectory will be lower than envisaged by the \nIMF. The CPRO grant will help Samoa\u2019s debt sustainability by substituting for potentially more \nexpensive borrowing to support the government\u2019s priority expenditures in a time of fiscal need.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n35.  The MOF will be the executing agency for the Samoa HEALS Program and oversee and \ncoordinate its implementation. Despite technical and institutional capacity constraints, risks are \nmitigated as the government plans to primarily use functioning mechanisms to implement and \nmonitor its program.41 The stimulus program will mostly use existing databases and disbursement \nchannels to reach the target beneficiaries.42 A national response matrix has been prepared \ncovering measures to be adopted by all government ministries, and chief executive officers of the \nministries are responsible for overseeing implementation of sectoral actions. The government will \n \n37 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 IMF. 2019.

Washington, DC.  \n39 Samoa\u2019s external debt is mostly long term, with more than 50% being concessional loans owed to the World Bank \nand ADB, and the rest to bilateral partners (80% to the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n40 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n41 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Summary of Key Social Protection Measures in Stimulus Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n ", "12 \nwork with nongovernment organizations  (NGOs) and village committees to provide welfare \nservices to the poor and vulnerable. The government will monitor the budget execution and flow \nof funds for countercyclical measures through MOF quarterly reports. Monitoring of specific \ncomponents will be subject to program monitoring using existing mechanisms (e.g., SNPF \nreviews of pensions and employment, and Ministry of Health reports on preparedness). ADB will \nprovide  technical  assistance  to  implement  specific  measures  as  requested,  monitor  social \noutcomes, and support the government to evaluate results of social protection measures using \nsex-disaggregated data, overseen by ADB\u2019s Pacific Country Office in Apia. \n \n36.  The Samoa HEALS Program will be implemented from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. The \nproceeds of the grant will be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n37.  Governance. The government is able to implement its budget, but there are weaknesses \nin procurement, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing. Improvements in public financial \nmanagement are being supported by development partners, including ADB (footnotes 30 and 40). \nAnticorruption efforts are governed by legislation and regulations, with an active civil society \nputting checks on the government. An ombudsman, appointed by parliament, is in place to \ninvestigate citizens\u2019 complaints against the government. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MOF and the government.  \n \n38.  Poverty and social. Since elderly people are more vulnerable to poverty, the Samoa \nHEALS Program includes a one-off pension of ST400 per person for all elderly (estimated 10,000 \npeople,  of  whom  54%  are  women),  plus  a  ST15  monthly  increase  in  elderly  pensions. \nUnemployment benefits are budgeted for 3,000\u20136,500 workers ($300 one-off payment for job loss, \n$200 for forced leave without pay, $100 for reduced working hours without pay). Resources are \nearmarked for frontline health care workers\u2019 risk benefits in case of COVID-19 infection or death. \nThe one-time special dividend from the SNPF will cover 85,000 members, including informal \nworkers. The stimulus program includes a one-time transfer of ST50 to all citizens, an estimated \n10.1% of whom live below $3.20/day. In-kind support and subsidies include reductions in water \nand electricity tariffs until December 2020 for households, 13.4% of which are poor and 19.5% \nheaded by women. Funding is provided for assistance to vulnerable groups (including the \ndisabled) through social welfare NGOs. Housing assistance is budgeted for poor households in \nneed, and rent-free operations for about 4,000 market vendors until August 2020 will help informal \nworkers. Removal of duties on basic food items until August 2020 as well as price controls to \nprevent inflation in the price of necessities will help the poor. Labor-market programs for the \nunemployed include support to agricultural firms to hire workers for land clearing and planting, \nand short-term paid training for up to 2,000 staff laid-off in the hospitality industry. \n  \n39.  Gender. The Samoa HEALS Program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \nThe program includes several proactive gender actions to help women meet their immediate \nneeds during the crisis and to support women\u2019s empowerment in the medium and longer term. \nMeasures  to  mitigate  health  risks  include  ring-fencing  essential  health  services,  including \nmaternal health care, and risk benefits for frontline health workers (of whom 57% are women). \nMeasures to address the impact of job losses include maintaining public service employment (of \nwhom 53% are women) and introducing unemployment benefits for affected workers (of whom \nabout 30% are estimated to be women). Support for women entrepreneurs includes (i) credit \nfacilities and interest relief, including for rural women\u2019s microfinance loans; (ii) increased funding \nto women artisans to allow the preservation of cultural heritage; and (iii) support for the Women \n ", "13 \nin Business Development program under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. About 4,000 \nmarket vendors (of whom more than 75% are women) will operate rent-free from April until August \n2020. Financial support is also provided for NGOs delivering services for gender-based violence \nsurvivors. To support women\u2019s participation and decision-making, the government will reestablish \nvillage women\u2019s committees as a central development coordination mechanism and forum for \nwomen\u2019s collective agency and leadership in communities, and provide ST3,600 each to 365 \ncommittees. The committees will disseminate information on COVID-19 and promote rural health \nand sanitation practices. Additional measures that will benefit women include removal of duties \non basic food items, price controls, reduction in utility tariffs, one-off ST50 cash transfers to all \nSamoans, and higher elderly pensions.  \n \n40.  Safeguards. Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the Samoa HEALS \nProgram is classified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. The actions have been assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n41.  Risks.

Samoa, classified as an upper-middle-income country with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nexogenous shock  of US$4,231 in FY2019, is a small Polynesian island country located in the South Pacific. The economy expanded by an annual \naverage of 4.3% between 2002 and 2007, before the global financial crisis, but since 2009, growth has slowed to an average of \n1.0% per year, due in large part to a sequence of economic shocks and disasters due to natural hazards that hit the country over \nthis period. Samoa\u2019s economic development opportunities are constrained by remoteness from large markets and foreign suppliers, \nthe small size of the domestic market, as well as the high frequency and intensity of disasters. These challenges have translated \ninto comparatively low and volatile GDP growth rates, elevated public debt, high vulnerability to external shocks, and significant \nimport dependence. These factors limit the government\u2019s ability to effectively respond to COVID-19. \n \nKey impact channels. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the ability of Samoa\u2019s economy to sustain \ngrowth, maintain resilience in the face of adverse external shocks, and weather the contagion effects of the global slowdown. While \nearly border closures have prevented a single confirmed case of COVID-19 in Samoa, the impact of the global contraction and strict \ntravel restrictions and social distancing guidelines have had severe consequences for the Samoan economy through the following \nchannels: \n\u2022  Tourism. The key channel of socioeconomic impacts is through contraction in visitor arrivals, which had peaked at more \nthan 178,500 arrivals in FY2019. Assuming travel restrictions in place until December 2020, visitor arrivals could plummet \nto about 38,500 in FY2021, with the contribution of tourism receipts to GDP also expected to fall significantly from 23.1% \nof GDP in FY2019 to around 5.2% in FY2021. This will negatively impact the performance of allied sectors like restaurants, \naccommodation, transport, and commerce which together account for about a third of employment. Foreign exchange \ninflows will also fall. \n\u2022  Remittances. Remittances (23.4% of FY2019 GDP) are projected to decline by almost 10% in FY2020, as seasonal \nworkers\u2014about 2,500 of whom work in Australia and New Zealand every year\u2014are affected by travel restrictions. Since \nmore than 80% of remittances are through money transfer operators, loss of the operators\u2019 correspondent banking relations \nin a tightening global regulatory landscape could further disrupt remittances. This will lead to lower consumption demand, \nparticularly for vulnerable households who depend on remittance income, and declining foreign exchange earnings.  \n\u2022  Trade. Samoa\u2019s merchandise trade will also suffer as tighter regulations on shipping and handling and border closures \nhamper the flow of goods. The country is highly dependent on imports (41.1% of FY2019 GDP), including food and fuel. \nSupply chain disruptions and restrictions in major trading partners will lead to imports falling by FY2021. Exports were only \n5.8% of Samoa\u2019s FY2019 GDP, but are expected to contract by about 10% in FY2020 as Samoa\u2019s key export partners go \ninto recession. Restrictions on movement of goods can weaken Samoa\u2019s export-oriented small and micro agribusiness \nindustries which support employment and income of many smallholders.  \n\u2022  Construction. Construction activity, which is about 6%\u20137% of GDP and supports about 7% of jobs, will be cut in half in \nFY2020. Some decline was to be expected with the completion of projects related to hosting the Pacific Games. \nRestrictions on international travel prevent movement of foreign consultants, contractors, and engineers who are important \nplayers in major infrastructure projects, and also hamper imports of construction equipment and materials for these \nprojects. \n \nDownward revision in projections for key economic variables. Economic impacts will be transmitted through these channels. \nThe economy is projected to contract for two successive years, in FY2020 and FY2021. Expenditures, which were largely declining \nafter the Cyclone Evan reconstruction phase in FY2014 due to fiscal prudence, are set to rise with fiscal stimulus and higher health \nexpenditures to prepare for COVID-19; and revenues, which were rising since FY2016 due to domestic tax efforts and higher grants, \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nwill decline as tax revenues fall. The fiscal deficit will rise from an average of 1.8% of GDP in FY2013\u2013FY2019 to 8.3% in FY2020\u2013\nFY2022. The current account balance is projected to fall to its lowest levels since Cyclone Evan reconstruction in FY2014, largely \ndue to a fall in tourism earnings and remittances, with current account deficits expected to average $46.5 million projected for \nFY2020\u2013FY2022. With disruptions to global supply chains and high dependence on imports, prices of imported goods are set to \nrise. Banking system indicators are generally sound, with declining non-performing loan ratios (7.1% in FY2015 to 3.9% in FY2019) \nand adequate liquidity, but could also come under stress with loan defaults as economic activity falls. The impacts of COVID-19 \nhave led to significant downward revisions in projections of key economic variables for FY2020 and FY2021, as summarized below. \n \nItem  FY2020 Projections  FY2021 Projections \nPre-COVID  Post-COVID  Pre-COVID  Post-COVID \nReal GDP growth (%)  3.5  (5.0)  2.7  (2.0) \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (1.2)  (7.3)  (2.0)  (9.8) \nCurrent account (% of GDP)  3.0  (7.1)  0.8  (7.0) \nCPI inflation (%)  2.0  2.8  1.9  2.5 \n             Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nSignificant social distress. The pandemic will lead to social pressures in Samoa. Over 8,000 jobs could be lost by FY2021, mostly \nin the tourism and allied sectors, of which about 30% could be women. Latest available data shows greater risks for vulnerable \ngroups, who may slip into poverty.  \n\u2022  8.3% of households nationally are at risk of slipping below the food poverty line, and 10.6% are at risk of slipping the below \nbasic needs poverty line \n\u2022  Female-headed households and the elderly (aged 65+) are more at risk of slipping into poverty. \n\u2022  Remittances are particularly important for poorer households, who will be more at risk if remittance fall.  \n\u2022  Vulnerability is greater among the 37.2% of all workers in the informal sector (including subsistence agriculture), of which \nabout 25.0% are women. \n \nDownside risks to outlook. The effects of the COVD-19 pandemic is likely to be protracted, and lockdowns and restrictions could \ncontinue well into FY2021 or even beyond until and effective COVID-19 vaccination is developed and distributed. This can lead to \nmore severe impacts on the economy than described. An actual outbreak of COVID-19 or a major disaster caused by natural \nhazards (which hits Samoa every 4 or 5 years) could be devastating. \nCountercyclical development  The government has put in place a comprehensive pro-poor countercyclical stimulus program, comprising two fiscal stimulus \nexpenditures  packages. The government\u2019s program comprises measures to safeguard livelihoods and purchasing power of citizens; support \nproductive sectors; and strengthen the health sector. \n \nThe first stimulus package, a supplementary budget for FY2020 of ST66.3 million ($24.8 million, 3.1% of GDP) was approved by \nParliament in April 2020. It contains several important measures,  \n\u2022  ST20.3 million for health sector response including: preparedness and prevention; negative pressure and isolation rooms; \nquarantine facilities; testing, tracing, reporting, and treatments; training for health workers; and COVID-19 medical and \nconsumables. \n\u2022  ST12.5 million for private sector economic activity (with special measures for hospitality sector) including: temporary rent-\nfree operations on property owned by SNPF, Samoa Ports Authority, and Samoa Airports Authority; reduction in electricity \nrates for hotels; and capital injection for Samoa Airways \n ", "Appendix 4  23 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n\u2022  ST27.5 million to enhance purchasing power of Samoans, including: assistance from SNPF (withdrawal of 20% of \ncontribution for unemployed in the hospitality sector); temporary moratorium and interest reduction on housing loan \nrepayments; ST300 special pension added to next monthly pension for elderly; and temporary reduction in water and \nelectricity tariffs. \n\u2022  ST3.5 million to support food security through intensifying local agricultural and fishing developments, including equipment \nand consumables required in the commercialization of local value-added agricultural processes like breadfruit flour, \ncoconut oil, avocado margarine and others to substitute imports. \n\u2022  ST2.5 million for multisector response to COVID-19 as required, including community outreach, communication, education, \nand police. Furthermore: all public servants to remain employed; all government projects for roads, airport and water to \ncontinue to ensure income generation opportunities; and free health care to continue for senior citizens, children below-\n15, and maternal health. \n \nAs part of the budget for FY2021, a second stimulus package of ST83.1 million ($31.1 million, 3.8% of GDP) was approved in \nJune 2020. The package includes several countercyclical support measures.  \n\u2022  ST4.9 million for health sector response, including upgrades to district hospitals to better prepare for COVID-19; promoting \nrural health and sanitation practices through 365 rural village women\u2019s communities; and assistance for frontline workers \nand their families in case of infection/death while serving COVID-19 patients. \n\u2022  ST10.6 million for private sector economic activity including: 2% interest relief for business loans with commercial banks; \nspecial credit facilities for small businesses; paid training for up to 2000 laid off hospitality employees; reduction in electricity \nrates for hotels until December; and partial compensation to exporters for lost exports (agriculture and fishing). \n\u2022  ST60.1 million to enhance purchasing power, including: special dividend from SNPF (85,000 members); one-off cash \ntransfer of ST50 to all citizens; one-off unemployment subsidy (ST300 if laid off, ST200 if leave without pay, ST100 if \nreduced work hours for up to 6,500 workers); rental subsidy until August for market vendors; ST100 special pension and \nST15 increase in pension for 10,000 elderly (for one year); extension of temporary reduction in water and electricity tariffs \n(until December); and duty concession on food essentials. \n\u2022  ST2.2 million to support food security through support for taro, cocoa, coconut, fruit and vegetable growers; waiver of \nlicensing fees for domestic fishing vessels until December; and employment to laid-off workers.  \n\u2022  ST5.3 million for multisector response, including: community outreach; shelter financing for households in need; one-time \nincrease in annual grants to schools to support COVID-19 prevention measures; and support to vulnerable groups through \ncommunity service organizations. \nPre-shock record of generally  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Samoa was implementing a sound budgetary framework. The authorities implemented measures \nsound economic management  aimed at improving revenue collection, including tax strengthening. The authorities\u2019 financial sector policies, including the focus on \nupdating the supervisory and regulatory framework and improving access to credit, were largely in line with IMF recommendations. \nThe external position of Samoa was also assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals and desired policy settings.  \n \nEconomic management was generally sound prior to the pandemic. Samoa developed a medium-term fiscal framework in March \n2013 (in the aftermath of Cyclone Evan disruptions) to bring the government\u2019s fiscal position to more sustainable levels over 3\u20135 \nyears. ADB supported the development of this framework through the joint policy action matrix process, along with other \ndevelopment partners. The medium-term fiscal framework laid out various targets: (i) budget deficit below 2% of GDP; (ii) current \nexpenditure below 30% of GDP; (iii) personnel costs below 40% of current expenditure; (iv) public debt below 50% of GDP; (v) debt \nservice below 20% of total revenue; and (vi) import cover between 4\u20136 months of imports. Since FY2016, through fiscal \nconsolidation measures, Samoa has largely stayed within these targets.  \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nAided by these policies, from an overall fiscal balance of -5.4% of GDP in FY2014 (largely due to Cyclone Evan reconstruction \nexpenditures), Samoa recorded a fiscal surplus of 2.7% in FY2019. Expenditures were controlled after the FY2014 spike, coming \ndown from 43.3% of GDP in FY2014 to 31.2% in FY2019. Revenues rose due to improved domestic resource mobilization efforts, \nwith tax revenues rising steadily since FY2016. From 54.9% of GDP in FY2015, external debt has come down to 46.9% in FY2019, \nas the government relied primarily on grant assistance and lowered fiscal deficits. The government internally targets debt to be 50% \nof GDP or below, and relies primarily on grants or concessional loans to finance development as needed.  \n \nThe current account balance improved from -8.1% of GDP in FY2014 to 2.3% in FY2019, aided by strong tourism and growing \nremittances. Samoa had reserves amounting to more than 6 months of import cover when COVID-19 hit the world economy. The \nfinancial sector was healthy. Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios were trending upwards, with the liquid asset ratio exceeding its \n5-year average, and banks were well-provisioned. \n \nGiven generally sound macroeconomic management, the pre-COVID-19 outlook for Samoa was reasonably healthy, albeit with \ndownside risks. Growth of 3.5% was projected for FY2020, with tourism expected to remain strong. A fiscal deficit of 1.2% of GDP \nwas budgeted for FY2020, well within the government\u2019s threshold of 2.0%. High earnings from tourism and remittances were \nexpected to continue, and lead to a current account surplus of 3.0% of GDP for FY2020. Slowdown in tourism and vulnerability to \nexternal shocks were considered the key risks facing the economy. \nStructural reforms  Strong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented a COVID-19 outbreak. Samoa is one of \nthe first countries in the world to implement strict travel restrictions in an effort to keep the economy free of COVID-19. Samoa has \nalso been quick to take action in response to COVID-19 developments. On 18 March 2020, Samoa reported its first suspected case \nof the coronavirus, an individual who had travelled from New Zealand. In response, the Samoan Government required all travelers \nincluding Samoan citizens to undergo a medical check-up upon returning. On 20 March 2020, Samoa declared a state of emergency, \nclosing its borders to all but returning citizens. On 26 March 2020, the international airport was closed.  \n \nThrough a proactive approach, the Health Emergency Operations Center operational plan was prepared with the objective to \nenhance the health sector\u2019s capacity in surveillance, early detection, control and prevention, response, and recovery from the \nCOVID-19 outbreak in the country. The plan is flexible and being reviewed and updated as and when required by Ministry of Health. \nThe plan was activated on 23 March 2020. \n \nA national sector preparations and response matrix against COVID-19 was also prepared in March, outlining short-, medium-, and \nlong-term actions for the following sectors: agriculture, communications, community, education, energy, environment, finance, \nhealth, law and justice, public administration, trade and commerce, transport and communications, tourism, and water and \nsanitation. All chief executive officers of government ministries and public bodies were empowered to exercise their statutory \nfunctions and duties provided under any legislation for the implementation of the actions outlined in the matrix.  \nDebt sustainability  Samoa was already at high risk of debt distress prior to the pandemic, on account of its vulnerability and narrow economic base. \nFollowing the pandemic, external public debt will remain sustainable over the long run, although still at high risk. Domestic debt was \nonly 1.5% of total public debt in FY2019. External debt as a share of GDP is expected to rise as higher fiscal deficits give rise to \npotential debt-creating flows. Maintaining the indicative deficit target at 1% of GDP on average starting from FY2023, and below the \nauthorities\u2019 2% annual deficit ceiling over the medium term, while seeking external grants to finance development projects, can \nlower the debt\u2013GDP trajectory. Domestic debt is less than 0.8% of GDP, and will not affect debt sustainability if maintained at low \nlevels.  \n \nThe Medium Term Debt Management Strategy 2016\u20132020 aims to achieve the government\u2019s overall debt management objective \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nto ensure that the financing needs of Samoa are met at all times on a timely basis and that the borrowing costs are as low as \npossible over the medium term, within a prudent risk level. The strategy mandates that borrowing over the medium term should \ncontinue to prioritize external concessional borrowing by limiting approval for external loans to those with at least 35% grant element \nand that support projects with a minimum positive economic return sufficient to cover the interest and repayment costs. In addition, \nmonitoring and management of public debt includes (i) implementation of the procedures and guidelines for contracting new loans \nand issuance of guarantees approved by Cabinet in 2014 to ensure that fiscal targets are adhered to; (ii) submission of annual \nreports to Cabinet and Parliament on debt management operations of the government; and (iii) setting of strategic indicators and \ntargets to monitor the costs and risk exposure of the public debt portfolio. Effective implementation of the Medium Term Debt \nManagement Strategy 2016\u20132020 is crucial to keep Samoa\u2019s debt at sustainable level. \n \nSamoa\u2019s external debt is on concessional terms, and long-term in nature. More than one half of total external debt is owed to \nmultilateral institutions (mostly the World Bank and ADB), and the rest comes from bilateral donors, of which around 80% is owed \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China. Debt is transparently reported, with the Ministry of Finance publishing government debt statistics \non its website every quarter. This report covers the currency and creditor composition of government debt and the lending terms. \nThe government seeks to maintain an indicative ceiling of 50% for the total debt\u2013GDP ratio. Discussions with ADB suggest that the \ngovernment is seeking to finance higher fiscal deficits following COVID-19 through grant financing from partners, with no loan \nfinancing specified in the budget. Any shortfall in partner grants is expected to be made up from revenue efforts (including direct \nassistance from public bodies and state-owned enterprises) and reprioritization of non-stimulus expenditures. The CPRO grant will \nhelp debt sustainability since it can substitute for potentially higher cost borrowing to finance fiscal deficits. The government is \nseeking grants from partners to finance its FY2020 and FY2021 deficits. No new loans (external or domestic) are planned to finance \nthe fiscal deficit.  \nCoordination with the IMF  ADB has been in close contact with the IMF, and has coordinated on key economic projections and debt sustainability analysis \npost-COVID. The IMF is strongly supportive of the CPRO, and the Rapid Credit Facility staff report and debt sustainability analysis \n(28 April 2020) have been provided in lieu of an assessment letter. \n \nThe IMF concluded in its assessment that the macroeconomic and financial sector performance in FY2019 was broadly sound, and \nthat Samoa showed resilience despite frequent external shocks. Based on the IMF\u2019s analysis, real GDP growth rebounded to 3.5% \nin FY2019, after a contraction in FY2018 due to the impacts of Cyclone Gita and the closure of an automotive manufacturing plant. \nThe IMF was projecting GDP growth of 4.4% in FY2020 before COVID-19, and a fiscal deficit of 1.8% of GDP. The IMF noted that \nthe risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, largely due to the country\u2019s high vulnerability to disasters and the potential \nwithdrawal of correspondent banking relationships. In this context, the IMF has highlighted the need to build fiscal buffers, while \nimplementing structural reforms targeted at boosting potential growth and making growth more inclusive. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, FY = fiscal year, \nGDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, SNPF = Samoa National Provident Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank, Government of Samoa. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20200722082912+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "adb rrp report recommendation president", "ModDate": "D:20200730091319+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 June 2020) \nCurrency unit  \u2013  tala (ST) \nST1.00  =  $0.36 \n$1.00  =  ST2.72 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nCOVID-19  \u2013  coronavirus disease \nCPRO  \u2013  COVID-19 pandemic response option \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \nHEALS  \u2013  Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support  \n  IMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \nNGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \nSNPF  \u2013  Samoa National Provident Fund \n \n \nNOTES \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Samoa and its agencies ends on \n30 June. \u201cFY\u201d before a calendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year \nends, e.g., FY2020 ends on 30 June 2020. \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars, unless otherwise stated. \n \n \nVice-President  Ahmed M.
