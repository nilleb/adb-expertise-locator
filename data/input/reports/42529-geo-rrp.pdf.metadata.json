The Program is a follow-up to \nADB's Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR) \nloan to Georgia, approved in November 2008. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSectors  (subsectors):  Multisector  (economic  and  public  affairs \nmanagement,  public  expenditure  and  fiscal  management,  social \nprotection) \n(promoting \nThemes \nmacroeconomic  stability),  governance  (economic  and  financial \ngovernance), social development \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n \nCategory C. No adverse environmental impacts identified. \n \n\n(subthemes): \n\nEconomic \n\ngrowth \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nin \n\nInvoluntary resettlement: category C \nImpact on indigenous peoples: category C \n\nEnvironment  \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector \nAssessment \n \nThe Program Description   The loss of investor confidence, caused initially by the August 2008 \nconflict and then by the international financial crisis have caused a \nand Rationale \nsharp  slowdown  in  capital  inflows  (both  foreign  direct  investment \n \nand private lending) to Georgia. The inflows may not recover to the \n \npre-crises  levels  until  2010.  These  exogenous  shocks  are  being \n \namplified  by  a  slowdown  in  Georgia's  export  markets  and  a \n \nreduction \n \nincoming  remittances.  All  major  components  of \naggregate  demand  in  the  economy  have  contracted  and  the \n \nmacroeconomic  outlook  for  Georgia  has  been  revised  downwards, \n \nand remains very uncertain at this stage. Before the August conflict, \n \nreal gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to grow at 11\u201312% \n \nin 2008. The actual GDP growth was 2%, with the forecast for 2009 \n \nat  1%.  Economic  activity  has  slowed  considerably,  profit  margins \n \nhave  sharply  decreased,  and  layoffs  have  risen.  The  social \n \nconsequences of these developments could be very severe.  \n \n \nThe Government and the monetary and financial sector authorities \nin Georgia have worked closely to address these challenges. When \nthe Georgian lari came under pressure in August 2008, and again in \nOctober  and  November,  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG) \nintervened to support the currency. To shore up reserves depleted \nin  defense  of  the  lari  and  to  bolster  lari  depositor  confidence,  the \nGovernment  and  the  NBG  entered  into  a  $750  million  Stand-By \nArrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By \nhelping  to  rebuild  the  official  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  to \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nfor \n\nrestore  confidence  in  the  lari,  the  SBA  framework  supports  the \nGovernment's  macroeconomic  policy  objectives  of  accelerating \nrecovery  through  fiscal  stimulus,  allowing  exchange  rate  flexibility, \nand safeguarding banking system stability.  \n \nA  significant  macroeconomic  stimulus  is  required  to  counter  these \nadverse shocks. However, the very high and increasing use of the \nUS dollar in the economy constrains what fiscal or monetary policy \ncan  do.  Such  constraints  can  only  be  relaxed  by:  (i)  recourse  to \nexternal and long-term loans from development partners to finance \ncore  public  expenditures  and  augment  foreign  exchange  reserves, \nand (ii) maintenance of some exchange rate stability, to avoid sharp \nfluctuations  in  the  value  of  the  lari.  In  parallel,  the  banking  system \nneeds to remain stable for these measures to be effective. \n \nThe joint needs assessment (JNA) by several development partners \nin  September  2008  remains  the  most  appropriate  framework  for \ndealing with the crisis, both in terms of assessing the need for, and \ndesigning,  budget  support  and  infrastructure  and  social  sector \nassistance.  The  JNA \nintervention  and \nidentifies  a  need \ndevelopment partner assistance in three major areas: (i) to help the \nGovernment ensure that critical economic and social needs are met \nand confidence is maintained, with quick-disbursing budget support \nto  back-stop  countercyclical  fiscal  measures  of  rapid  effect;  (ii)  to \nresettle    internally  displaced  persons  and  address  the  post-conflict \nneeds  of  affected  populations;  and  (iii)  to  support  critical  new \ninvestments.  The  JNA  notes \nthat  high-value  and  high-yield \ninvestments  are  key  to  maximizing  recovery  prospects  and  that \nsuch  investments  will  also  have  lasting  positive  effects  on  the \neconomy's productive capacity. \n \nThe JNA estimated the overall resource requirements at $3.7 billion \nover a 3-year period. Actions were prioritized in three stages: stage \n1  (6  months,  September  2008\u2013March  2009);  stage  2  (12  months, \nApril 2009\u2013March 2010); and stage 3 (12\u201318 months, March 2010\u2013\nSeptember 2011). The relevance of the JNA has been reinforced by \nthe  severity  of  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  Georgia  and  the \ncontinuing uncertainty of capital flows. \n \nThe  proposed  Program  is  a  follow-up  to  the  EAPCR.  The \nmacroeconomic policy framework anchor is provided for in the SBA \nbetween  Georgia  and  the  IMF.  Like  the  earlier    program,  it  is \nanchored  on  the  JNA.  It  will  continue  ADB  support  for  the \nGovernment to help it meet critical public expenditures and cushion \nthe  adverse  revenue  shocks  that  will  probably  persist  throughout \n2009.  The  Program  will  complement \ntwo  planned  ADB \ninfrastructure  projects  (the  Municipal  and  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  and  the  Ajara  Bypass  Roads  Project).  The \nWorld Bank plans to provide $85 million in budget support through \nits  Development  Policy  Operation.  The  European  Union  is  also \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n\nexpected  to  provide  budgetary  assistance  in  the  near  future.    The \nProgram will support the following outputs.  \n   \nOutput  1.  Incremental  expenditure  needs  arising  from  the  worse-\nthan-expected  economic  conditions  in  2009  are  met  without \ncomplete drawn down of cash balances at NBG.  \n \nOutput  2.  The  delivery  of  the  core  Government  expenditure \nprogram  for  2009  in  accordance  with  the  approved  budget, \nirrespective of subsequent revisions that take into account shortfalls \nin revenue. \n \nThe impact of the Program will be partial mitigation of the adverse \neconomic  and  social  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis.  ADB's \nsupport,  as  part  of  the  overall  crisis  mitigation  efforts,  will  help  to \nrevive real GDP growth rates to an annual average of at least 4% a \nyear over 2009\u20132011. \n\nitems \n\nthat  have  been  prioritized  by \n\nFull  Alignment  with \nthe  Government's  Crisis  Mitigation \nProgram.  ADB's  support  will  be  part  of  the  Government's  crisis \nmitigation  plan,  which  is  embodied  in  the  JNA.  It  will  help  sustain \nkey  expenditure \nthe \nGovernment.  The  social  safety  net  and  physical  infrastructure \ninvestment  plans  included  in  the  JNA,  to  be  funded  by  the \nGovernment  and  its  development  partners,  are  expected  to  allow \nGeorgia  to  respond  effectively  to  the  drastic  decline  in  capital \ninflows that began in 2008, and which the global financial crisis has \nnow confirmed.  \n \nBudget  Support  with  the  IMF  Stand-By  Arrangement  as  the \nAnchor. Satisfactory progress with the IMF's SBA is a prerequisite \nfor  Program  approval.  The  SBA's  actions  and  performance \nfocus  on  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policy \nbenchmarks \nconsistency with external macroeconomic balance, and on ensuring \nfinancial sector confidence, thus opening space for a fiscal stimulus \npackage  to  be  funded  by  official  inflows  to  limit  the  economic \nslowdown. With the IMF Program and the JNA as the two principal \nanchors, the proposed Program will not have its own set of policy or \ninstitutional reform measures. \n \nParallel  Focus  on  Critical  Financial  Sector  Reforms.  Georgia \nneeds  to  undertake  certain  critical  financial  sector  regulatory \nmeasures  immediately.  The  following  key  measures  and steps  are \nbeing  taken  as  an  outcome  of  the  policy  dialogue  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  They  have  been  agreed  upon  and \nrecognized  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Working  with  development \npartners, the Government will:  \n \n\n(i) \n   \n(ii) \n \n\nintroduce a regulatory framework to mitigate  \nsystemic banking risks,  \ncomplete \nsettlement system,  \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  real-time  gross\n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nTranching \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n(v) \n \n \n \n\n  develop \n\nthe  operational \n\nframework \n\nfor \n\nforeign\n\nexchange auctions,  \n\n  design a foreign exchange dealing system, and \n  further  develop  action  plan  for  maintaining  financial \nand  macroeconomic  stability  with  clear  division  of\nresponsibilities  among  the  relevant  ministries  and \nagencies (also an action under the IMF SBA).  \n\n  \nUse  of  Covenants  to  Monitor  Execution  of  Key  Expenditure \nItems.  The  Government  has  identified  key  expenditure  items  for \n2009,  which  the  Program  aims  to  insulate  from  further  revenue \nshocks.  For  monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes, \nthese  key \nexpenditure  items  shall  be  included  as  covenants  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n\nThe loans will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $80  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nAsian Development Fund resources. ADB will provide two loans with \nsynchronized  repayment  schedules:  (i)  a  loan  of  $50  million \nequivalent  for  a  term  of  24  years,  including  an  8-year  grace  period \nand  with  an  interest  rate  at  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  $30  million \nequivalent  from  the  ADF  hard-term  facility  for  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding an 8-year grace period and with an interest rate of 1.6% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  for  each  interest  period \nthereafter. \n\nThe  expected  closing  date  of  the  loan  is  31  December  2009.  The \nloan is planned to be fully utilized by the Government within 2009. \n\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency.  \n\nLoan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for  items  procured  in  ADB \nmember countries, other than the items specified in the negative list \nof  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification \nof  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program \nloans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a \ncertificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the total \nimports  of  Georgia,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible \nfinanced  under  other  official \ndevelopment  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of \nthe  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  a  particular  year.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.   \n\nimports,  and \n\nimports \n\n\f  v\n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF loan shall be used to support public \nexpenditure objectives under the program. \n\nThe  slowdown  in  economic  activity  needs  to  be  countered  by  an \nexpansionary  fiscal  policy  package  that  stops  the  downward  spiral \nof  loss  of  confidence  and  contraction  in  demand,  mitigates  the \nadverse  social  impacts  of  the  crisis,  and  provides  a  platform  for \nfuture  growth  by  creating  high-value,  high-impact  public \ninfrastructure.  \n\nIn \nthe  absence  of  domestic  debt  markets,  only  external \ndevelopment  partner  support  in  the  form  of  hard  currency  can \nenable  the  Government  to  respond  to  the  current  circumstances \nwith  a  well-designed \nfiscal  stimulus  package.  That  external \nassistance has been sought in the context of the JNA, a multi-year \nand  multi-development-  partner  effort.  The  Program,  together  with \nparallel budget support from the World Bank and European Union, \nwill help the Government to implement the fiscal measures already \nincluded in the 2009 budget aimed at preventing a deterioration of \nsocial situation as a result of the economic crisis.  \n\nAlthough there was confidence that the process initiated by the JNA \nand finalized at the Brussels Conference would mean Georgia was \nwell  positioned  to  weather  the  shocks  described  above,  recent \nmonths  have  revealed  additional  signs  of  vulnerability  in  the \nfinancial sector and in the resources available to the Government to \nmitigate the negative effects of the shocks. Georgia's development \npartners  recognize  the  need  to  maintain  resource  flows  to  the \ncountry.  \n\nThe  Government  launched  the  JNA  within  days  of  the  outbreak  of \nthe  August  2008  conflict  to  ensure  that  there  was  a  clear  strategy \nand  sufficient  resources  to  keep  the  focus  on  reforms  and  secure \nsufficient      resources  to  keep  Georgia  on  track.  At  the  same  time, \nthe  Government  worked  with  several  development  partners  to \nestablish  a  3-year  timeframe  for  the  JNA.  This  demonstrates  the \nGovernment's  capacity  to  act  quickly  in  the  face  of  adversity  and \nchallenges. A recent review of the JNA led by the World Bank and \nthe  United  Nations  found:  \"the  Government  has  managed  the \nrecovery  and  reconstruction  effort  with  skill  and  determination  and \nthe results on the ground have been highly encouraging.\"  \n\nframework.  The \n\nThe  signs  of  vulnerability  in  the  financial  sector  highlight  the  need \nfor the regulatory authorities to have an effective prompt corrective \naction \nfinancial  supervision  and  monetary \nauthorities'  willingness  to  improve  risk  mitigation  in  the  financial \nsector is reassuring Georgia's development partners. \n \nOther  external  risks  include  the  potential  rekindling  of  regional \ntensions. However, this is mitigated by the multilateral presence in the \nfield. There have also been political tensions within Georgia, although \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProject Benefits \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nthe protests have been peaceful. The nature of the crisis is such that \nthere  is  likely  to  be  a  consensus  across  the  political  spectrum  with \nrespect to the urgent need for crisis mitigation.  \n \n  \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed  program \n\n1. \nloans to Georgia for the Growth Recovery Support Program.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE 2008 CONFLICT AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CRISIS \n\n2. \nPre-Crisis  Performance.  Georgia  has  implemented  noteworthy  investment  climate  and \npublic  financial  management  reforms  before  the  armed  conflict  with  Russia  in  August  2008 \naggravated  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  reforms,  coupled  with  a  wide  ranging \nprivatization  program,  helped  attract  significant  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  into  the  country. \nAnnual  economic  growth  rates  averaged  10.5%  over  2005\u20132007,  supported  by  a  surge  in  FDI \ninflows  and  the  resulting  increase  in  demand,  and  reached  12.4%  in  2007.  In  August  2007,  an \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  document  on  Georgia  noted  that  \"economic  performance  in \nrecent  years  has  been  impressive,  with  the  establishment  of  macroeconomic  stability,  a  dramatic \nfiscal  turnaround,  and  remarkable  improvements  in  governance  and  the  business  environment\u2026\"2 \nBefore the conflict and the exogenous economic shocks, economic growth was forecast to be above \n9% for both 2008 and 2009.3  \n \n\nFigure 1: External Shocks to Economic Activity \n\nGeorgia\u2019s 5-Year Eurobond Spread \n\n20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n8 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n0 \n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\ni\n\ns\nt\nn\no\np\n \ns\ni\ns\na\nb\n\n \n\n \n,\ns\ne\ni\nr\nu\ns\na\ne\nr\nT\nS\nU\n \nr\ne\nv\no\nd\na\ne\nr\np\ns\n \nd\nl\ne\ni\nY\n\n \n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nEconomic growth scenario pre-conflict (LHS axis)\n\nEconomic growth scenario post-conflict (LHS axis)\nFDI (% GDP) scenario pre-conflict (RHS axis)\n\nFDI (% GDP) scenario post-conflict (RHS axis)\n\n \n8\n0\n-\nr\np\nA\n\n \n\n \n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n \n \n\n \n8\n0\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n\n \n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n \n\n \n8\n0\n-\ng\nu\nA\n\n \n \n \n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n8\n0\n-\nt\nc\nO\n\n \n\n \n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n \n8\n0\n-\nc\ne\nD\n\n \n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n \n\n \n9\n0\n-\nb\ne\nF\n\n \n9\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, FDI = foreign direct \ninvestment, LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side. \n \nSources: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

The key pillars of economic growth and stability in Georgia have been \n3. \ndisrupted  by  the  conflict  and  the  crisis.  FDI  inflows,  international  private  lending  to  commercial \nbanks,  and  related  privatization  revenues  have  decelerated  sharply;  a  trend  that  is  expected  to \npersist over the next 12\u201318 months at least.

Subsequently,  this  spread \nwidened to almost 2000 basis points by late November, in great part as a result of heightened global \nrisk  aversion.  As  a  result  of  the  sudden  halt  in  FDI  and  debt  inflows,  consumer  and  investor \nspending  plunged,  leading  to  sharp  reductions  in  producer  price  growth  and  corporate  profits,  as \nwell as in overall economic activity. Table 1 captures these deteriorating trends. \n \nSharp Reduction in Business Activity and Job Creation. The negative shock to FDI and \n4. \ndebt inflows has been aggravated by a recent decline in remittances and a slowdown in Georgia's \nexport markets. As a result, all major components of aggregate demand have contracted. Demand \nand price growth have been hit particularly hard for non-tradables, such as construction, tourism and \ntransport, which have constituted the bulk of the Georgian economy in recent years. This in turn has \nslashed  profit  margins  and  increased  unemployment  throughout  the  economy.  The  outlook  for \nGeorgia has been revised downwards several times, and remains at this stage very uncertain. The \nsocial consequences of an eventual scenario of negative growth could be significant. \n \n5. \nPotential  Financial  Sector  Stress. The banking system has had to deal with both a sharp \ncontraction in dollar liquidity as international funding availability has dried up, and with a general and \nrapid  deterioration  in  borrowers'  creditworthiness.  With  urban  unemployment  increasing  and  profit \nmargins rapidly shrinking, the ability of many borrowers to repay loans has been seriously affected. \nAbout half the bank loans are collateralized by real estate, whose prices are now starting to come \ndown (anecdotal estimates point to a 15% reduction since November 2008). The ratio of banks' non-\nperforming loans has increased rapidly in the past few months, while general refinancing options for \nthe banking sector have shrunk. The usual symptoms of liquidity problems can already be observed, \nwith  some  banks  increasing  interest  rates  on  their  time  deposits  in  order  to  retain  cash  balances. \nSome banks have had need of foreign exchange liquidity, which presented a challenge to monetary \nand  exchange  rate  policy.  Bank  lending  to  the  private  sector  has  significantly  declined  since \nNovember  2008.  Eventually,  some  sector  restructuring  may  occur,  as  risks  of  continued  problems \ncannot be ruled out. Figure 2 shows how the crisis has evolved over the last few months, triggered \nby exogenous events and shocks. \n\n                                                \n \n4  IMF second review of the standby facility, March 2009. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n  \n2011 \n  \n\nTable 1: Georgia Key Economic Outlook Indicators, Pre- and Post-Crises \n \n  \n2009 \n  \n\n  \n2010 \n  \n\n2008 \n\nPost-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\nApril a \n2009 \nscenario \n  \n\nPre-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\nPost-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\nApril a \n2009 \nscenario \n  \n\nPre-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\nPost-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\n    2.0 \n\n    5.5 \n\n     8 \n\n     9 \n\n        4 \n\n        8 \n\n   1.0 \n\n      7 \n\n      7 \n\n      8 \n\n       6 \n\n       6 \n\nApril a \n2009 \nscenario \n  \n\n       3 \n\n       6 \n\nPre-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\nPost-\nconflict \nscenario \n \n\nApril \n2009 \nscenario \n \n\n        7 \n\n        8 \n\n       6 \n\n       6 \n\n    5 \n\n    6 \n\n  17.1 \n\n     15 \n\n    9.3 \n\n    9.5 \n\n     12 \n\n   8.6 \n\n    9.2 \n\n     10 \n\n     9.2 \n\n  10.4 \n\n     8.9 \n\n     9.2 \n\n11.2 \n\n    12 \n\n  14.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,535 \n\n2,081 \n\n1,201 \n\n1,218 \n\n1,845 \n\n1,169 \n\n1,032 \n\n1,775 \n\n1,398 \n\n1,240 \n\n1,825 \n\n1,564 \n\n1,451 \n\n(19.6) \n\n  (16.6) \n\n  (20.8) \n\n  (22.6) \n\n    (14) \n\n   (18.7) \n\n  (16.7) \n\n  (12.5) \n\n  (15.9) \n\n  (17.6) \n\n (11.6) \n\n  (14.2) \n\n(15.5) \n\n17.5 \n\n  18.5 \n\n      21 \n\n  20.7 \n\n    18 \n\n   25.9 \n\n    26 \n\n  29.9 \n\n   30 \n\n29.2 \n\n  28.5 \n\n   27.7 \n\n30.7 \n\n26.9 \n\n     26 \n\n29.5 \n\n26.4 \n\n25.5 \n\n     27 \n\n 26.4 \n\n  25.1 \n\n   26 \n\n  \n\n2007 \n \n\n 12.4 \n\nPre-\nconflict \nscenario \n  \n\n       9 \n\n    11 \n\n     10 \n\n 11.5 \n\n  12.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    3.5 \n\n       8 \n\n  13.9 \n\n \n\n \n\nKey Pre- and Post-\nCrises Economic \nIndicators \n\nGrowth and Inflation \n\nGDP Growth Rate (%) \nInflation (end of  period) \n\n(%) \n\nUnemployment Rate (%) \nInvestments and \nBalance of \nPayments \nForeign Direct \n\nInvestment  (% of \nGDP) \n\nForeign Direct \n\nInvestment ($ million) \nCurrent Account Balance   \n\n(% of GDP) \n\nExternal Public Debt  (%  \n\nof GDP) \nRevenue and \n\nExpenditures \nConsolidated Public \nRevenues (% of \nGDP) \n\nConsolidated Public \n\nExpenditures (% of \nGDP) \n\nOverall Fiscal Balance \n\n(% of GDP) \n\n (4.7) \n\n       (4) \n\n    (6.2) \n\n  (6.4) \n\n     (3) \n\n    (3.8) \n\n  (5.6) \n\n     (2) \n\n  (1.5) \n\n  (5.1) \n\n     (1) \n\n    (0.6) \n\n  (3.4) \n\n(479) \n\nOverall Fiscal Balance  \n      ($ million) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, GNI = gross national income. \na IMF second review of the standby facility. \nSource: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  August \n2008 conflict, the damage to physical infrastructure and the urgent need to address the needs of \n120,000  additional  internally  displaced  persons  imposed  significant  strains  on  public  finances. \nThe negative shock to fiscal revenues risked jeopardizing critical programs and fiscal stability. \nPublic  spending  because  of  conflict-related  costs 5   was,  to  some  extent,  offset  by  trimming \nnonessential  expenditures  and  drawing  down  the  Treasury's  cash  balances  at  the  NBG. \nHowever,  fiscal  pressure  was  evident  and  an  amendment  to  the  2008  budget,  submitted  in \nSeptember  2008  to  Parliament,  projected  lower  revenues  than  envisaged,  lower  privatization \nreceipts,  and  higher  expenditures  as  a  result  of  the  conflict.  It  also  predicted  a  decrease  in \nnonessential  expenditures,  although  this  decrease  was  insufficient  to  offset  the  decline  in \nrevenues  and  increases  in  other  expenditures.  It  was  in  this  context  that  the  Joint  Needs \nAssessment (JNA) was launched by the Government and its development partners immediately \nafter  the  conflict  (Appendix  7).  The  JNA  estimated  that  $3.7  billion  would  be  needed  for \nGeorgia\u2019s  post-conflict  recovery.  A  key  driving  factor  in  the  JNA  was  how  to  support  Georgia \neffectively  so  that  the  successful  reform  momentum  before  the  August  conflict  would  not  be \nderailed. The JNA also estimated the financial assistance required to reestablish conditions for \na  return  to  sustained  growth  under  several  scenarios,  including  a  worst  case  in  which  the \ninterruption in capital inflows would continue till 2011. Of the estimated JNA requirements, $896 \n\n                                                 \n5  These costs arose mainly from the high number of internally-displaced citizens immediately after the conflict, who \n\nneeded shelter, food and a social services program. \n\n\f  5\n\nmillion  will  be  needed  immediately  for  recovery  efforts  (for  the  period  until  March  2009), \nincluding $480 million to meet immediate budgetary needs.  \n \n7. \nResponse  from  Development  Partners.  Several  development  partners,  including  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  responded  promptly  in  the  aftermath  of  the  August  2008 \nconflict. Table 2 lists these initiatives, most of which were based on the September 2008 JNA.  \n \n\nTable 2: Post-Conflict Development Partner Assistance for Georgia in 2008 \n($ million) \n\nDevelopment Partner Details \nInternational Monetary Fund \n18-month Stand-By Arrangement \nFinancing support to rebuild gross international reserves and to help restore investor confidence \nUnited States \nBudget support  \nEmergency relief and rehabilitation support \nWorld Bank \nSupplemental Financing of Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Operation   \nMunicipal Development Fund  \nEuropean Union \nBudget Support \nGovernment of the Netherlands \nInternational Finance Corporation \nTrade finance and liquidity facility for banks \nAsian Development Bank \nEmergency Assistance Post-Conflict Recovery  \nMunicipal Development Fund (approved in September 2008) \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n\nAmount \n750.0 \n\n \n250.0 \n750.0 \n \n  40.0 \n  40.0 \n    50.0 \n    15.0 \n    3.0 \n \n200.0 \n \n  70.0 \n  40.0 \n\n8. \nIMF Program. The rising pressures on the lari required pragmatic and swift actions from \nthe  authorities.  In  October\u2013November  2008,  the  authorities  let  the  lari  slide  by  about  17% \nagainst  the  US  dollar  and  then  intervened  at  the  end  of  November  forcefully  to  stop  the \ndownward  spiral  at  a  new  support  level,  which  it  has  been  able  to  maintain.  To  shore  up \nreserves depleted in defense of the lari and to bolster lari depositor confidence, the Government \nand  the  NBG  entered  into  a  $750  million  Stand-By  Arrangement  (SBA)  with  the  IMF  in \nSeptember  2008.  To  accommodate  the  liquidity  squeeze  faced  by  banks,  the  NBG,  in \ncoordination  with  the  Financial  Supervisory  Agency,  adjusted  its  regulatory  framework  by:  (i) \nlowering  reserve  requirements,  (ii)  reducing  the  liquidity  ratio  requirement,  (iii)  introducing  a \nspecial bridge financing facility, and (iv) putting in place a refinancing window to provide a new \nbenchmark policy rate. \n \n9. \nADB Immediate Response. ADB has responded swiftly in the aftermath of the conflict. \nIn  addition  to  participating  in  the  JNA  exercise,  measures  taken  by  ADB  in  2008  included: \nfinalization  and  approval  of  $40  million  in  investment  support  through  the  Municipal  Services \nDevelopment  Fund  Project; 6   close  coordination  with  the  principal  development  partners  of \nGeorgia, particularly the World Bank, the IMF, the European Union (EU), and the United States; \nand  mobilizing  an  additional  $70  million  equivalent  in  ADF  resources.7  to  meet  critical  public \nexpenditures  through  the  budget  and  help  to  cushion  adverse  revenue  shocks.  As  its  major \noutputs, the EAPCR aimed to ensure that: (i) immediate incremental expenditure needs arising \n\n                                                 \n6    ADB.  2008.

By  the  end  of  October  and  early  November  2008,  the \neffects  of  the  international  liquidity  crisis  started  to  unfold  in  Georgia.  These  impacts  are \nexpected to continue adversely affecting the Georgian economy for the next 12\u201318 months. The \nreversal  of  the  international  carry  trade  in  currencies  since  October  2008  (as  a  direct \nconsequence  of  the  global  liquidity  crisis  and  heightened  global  perception  of  risk)  started  to \nexert  strong  funding  pressures  on  the  Georgian  banking  sector  through  exchange  rate \npressures. There have been large lari deposit withdrawals and a sudden increase in the use of \nthe  US  dollar  in  the  economy. 8  Refinancing  options  of  international  syndications  have  now \nbecome  much  less  available. 9   Together  with  the  declining  demand  for  lari,  this  has  added \nforeign exchange liquidity concerns to the deteriorating loan portfolio quality conditions in banks. \nThe resilience of the banking system has declined.  \n \n11. \nIn response, the NBG and the Financial Supervisory Agency have relaxed liquidity and \nreserve  requirements  and  provided  some  short-term  liquidity  support  to  financial  institutions. \nHowever, this has its limits and it is now crucial to (i) stimulate the real economy with an overall \nframework of public works that can establish a floor to the decline in economic activity and lari \ndemand, and (ii) improve the authorities' capacity to monitor the financial system.  \n \n12. \nCurrent  economic  circumstances  confirm  the  difficult  scenarios  already  built  into  the \nJNA,  and  the  expectation  that  fiscal  difficulties  would  continue  thorough  2009\u20132011  with \nshortfalls  in  revenue  collection  (when  compared  with  the  pre-conflict  and  pre-international \nfinancial crisis period). The macroeconomic situation calls for the Government to adopt a very \nclear fiscal stance to reverse the downturn. However, the very high use of the US dollar in the \neconomy  limits  what  both  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  can  do  to  address  the  situation.  These \nconstraints  can  only  be  relaxed  by  (i)  hard-currency  long-term  loans  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  partners  to  finance  public  spending  and  provide  additional  foreign  exchange \nreserves to back the NBG's exchange rate policy, (ii) maintenance of a stable exchange rate (at \nleast to the extent that sharp fluctuations in the lari value are avoided), and (iii) stability in the \nbanking system. \n \n13. \nJoint  Needs  Assessment. The JNA remains fully relevant as a framework to address \nthe  impact  of  the  global  crisis  on  Georgia  and  can  be  used  to  coordinate  the  work  of  the \nGovernment  and  its  development  partners.  The  JNA  identified  the  need  for  intervention  and \ndevelopment  partner  assistance  in  several  areas,  including  essential  productivity-enhancing \ninfrastructure  investment  and  targeted  social  support  to  bridge  the  period  of  private  capital \ninflows drought. It was developed as a contingency plan and is fully appropriate to the current \ncircumstances.  Of  the  external  financial  assistance  needs  estimated  until  March  2009  ($896 \nmillion)  in  the  JNA,  development  partners  had  disbursed  more  than  half  ($564.2  million)  by  1 \nApril,  2009,  and  mostly  in  the  form  of  budget  support  ($395.9  million).  Of  the  total  \n$878  million  development  partner  assistance  pledged  and  contracted  in  2008,  the  remaining \nhalf,  mostly  infrastructure  financing,  will  be  disbursed  gradually  during  2009.  For  2009,  the \n\n                                                 \n8  Recent episodes of  withdrawals on lari deposits may repeat themselves every time there is some exchange rate \npressure. Sharp downwards exchange rate movements will negatively affect the balance sheets of both banks and \ncompanies. \n\n9  Although foreign net private equity and lending inflows to banks was about $681 million in the first half of 2008, they \n\nwere negative in the second half of 2008, and are now expected to remain very low throughout 2009. \n\n\f  7\n\nGovernment  is  working  with  its  development  partners  on  a  tentative  list  of  new  projects  and \nprograms (Table 3). \n \n\nTable 3: Tentative Pipeline of New Donor Assistance Approvals for 2009 \n\n \n \nProjects and Programs \nLoans \nThird  East-West  Highway \n\nImprovement  Project \n\n(Sveneti-Rikoti \n\nsegment, including Rikoti tunnel rehabilitation) \n\nVaziani-Gombori-Telavi Road Project \nDevelopment Policy Credit (budget support) \nGrowth Recovery Support Program (budget support) \nAdjara Bypass Roads \nMunicipal and Urban Infrastructure Development Project  \n500 kv High-Voltage Power Transmission Line Construction Project \nRailway  Rehabilitation  and  Construction  Project \nGeorgian Railways) \nMunicipal  Water  and  Solid  Waste  Management  Project  Pipeline  with \n\n(directly  with \n\nMunicipal Development Fund of Georgia \n\n \nDonor \n \nWorld Bank \n\nWorld Bank \nWorld Bank \nADB \nADB \nADB \nEBRD-EIB-KfW \nEBRD-EIB \n\nEBRD (with matching grant \nsupport from  other Donors) \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n1,210.3 \n160 \n\n  50 \n  85 \n  80 \n150 \n  30 \n279 \n173 \n\n  24 \n\n \nZestaponi-Kutaisi-Samtredia Highway Rehabilitation-Construction \n \nGrants \nIDP housing support (budget support) \nMacro-Financial Assistance Program (budget support)  \n \nFood Security Program (budget support)  \nRemainder of US pledge  \nMatching  Grant  Support  to  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Policy \nCredit \n \nTotal \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  EIB  =  European \nInvestment  Bank,  KfW  =  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau,  EC  =  European  Commission,  JICA  =  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n\nEC \nUS Government \nNetherland Government \n\n180 \n \n     486.33 \n  67 \n  61 \n\nJICA \n \n \nEC \nEC \n\n    3 \n352 \n    3 \n\n 1,696.65 \n\n \n\n \n\n14. \nGeorgian  State  Budget. The Government submitted the 2009 budget to Parliament in \nDecember  2008.  The  budget  was  based  on  an  assumption  of  2.0\u20132.5%  economic  growth  for \n2009  (Table  4).  Table  4  also  presents  budget  execution  in  2008  for  comparison.  Overall,  the \nGovernment  has  tried  to  compress  recurrent  state  expenditures  (reflected  in  a  projected \ndecrease  in  goods  and  services  expenditure  and  grants  to  local  administration,  with  a  small \nincrease in recurrent capital expenses and subsidies) and to increase public investment.   \n \n15. \nA  key  feature  of  the  2009  budget  is  the  budgeted  draw-down  of  the  state's  cash \nbalances  deposited  at  the  NBG  in  the  amount  of  GEL522.2  million.  This  presents  risks  to  the \nnormal  functioning  of  expenditure  programs,  which  in  the  current  circumstances  should  be \navoided.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  Government's  budget  for  2009  was  presented  and \napproved with a zero ex-post financing gap.  \n \n16. \nBased  on  ADB's  commitments  in  late  2008,  $40  million  had  already  been  tentatively \nbudgeted  by  the  Government  as  a  new  net  lending  item,  corresponding  to  about  GEL66.5 \nmillion.  The  same  amount  was  also  budgeted  to  take  into  account  the  World  Bank's  new \ndevelopment policy operation to be approved in June 2009. \n \nThe  execution  of  the  first  quarter  already  shows  signs  of  worse  macroeconomic \n17. \nconditions than expected last December: net of tax payments made by the Ministry of Defense \nfor taxes due in 2008, the tax revenue collection for the first 3 months of 2009 was 11.4% below \nthe  collection  in  the  same  period  in  2008.  In  view  of  the  shortfall  in  budget  revenues  already \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\n \n\nrecognized  for  the  first  quarter  of  2009,  and  the  delays  in  execution  of  some  donor-funded \ninvestment projects, the Government has requested the concerned donor partners to increase \nthe  amounts  of  budget  support  operations  being  processed,  and  to  the  extent  possible  shift \nalready  committed  project-related  assistance  onto  general  budget  assistance.  The  scheduled \nsubmission of a revised 2009 State Budget to the Georgian Parliament is in July.

Although  external  financing  for  post-conflict  reconstruction  may  increase  the  debt  ratios \nover  the  next  2  years,  the  debt  outlook  is  expected  to  recover  and  improve  over  the  medium \nterm.  Georgia's  key  medium-term  risks  involve  large  debt  servicing  in  2012\u20132013  associated \nwith the repayments to the IMF under its recent SBA and the 2008 Eurobond (Appendix 2). \n\nIV. \n\nADB\u2019S ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n\n \n\n19. \nAsian  Development  Bank  Country  Strategy  and  Program.  ADB\u2019s  interim  operational \nstrategy  for  Georgia  (2008\u20132009),  approved  in  January  2008,  focuses  on  (i)  improving  service \n\n\f  9\n\ndelivery in municipal infrastructure within the evolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road \ntransportation  constraints  on  economic  activity,  and  (iii) upgrading  and  developing  energy \ninfrastructure.10 These priorities were identified based on the following considerations:  \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\naligning priorities with the Government\u2019s development agenda,  \nfocusing limited resources on a small number of areas, and  \nensuring complementarities with other development partners.  \n\n \nHowever,  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  economic  shocks  of  the  second  half  of  2008  has \n20. \nreconfigured  the  Government's  short-  and  medium-term  policy  plans,  and  made  external \nassistance in the form of budget support critical. ADB's interim strategy also highlights the need \nfor ADB to be responsive to rapid changes in circumstances. \n \n21. \nOther Recent and Ongoing Assistance. A number of other development partners have \nsupported  public  financial  management,  private  sector  development,  and  social  safety  net \nreforms in Georgia in recent years (Appendix 3). The program of the United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  includes  support  in  the  areas  of  budgeting,  treasury  management, \ngovernance,  anticorruption,  and  private  sector  development.  The  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Agency supports in public sector and in governance reforms. The United Nations \nDevelopment  Program  has  initiatives  in  the  areas  of  administrative  and  civil  service  reforms, \npoverty  monitoring,  and  financial  system  modernization.  The  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom  has  provided  support  in  developing  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  health  sector  budget  management.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands  supports  Georgia  in  areas,  among  others,  related  to  governance  and  oversight \nin \ninstitutions.  The  program  of \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, auditing, and administrative reform. The EC, together with the \nWorld  Bank,  has  just  completed  a  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA)  for \nGeorgia.

ADB's support will be \npart  of  the  Government's  crisis  mitigation  plan,  which  is  embodied  in  the  JNA,  and  it  will  help \nsustain  key  expenditure  items,  prioritized  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  social  safety  net \nand  physical  infrastructure  investment  plans  included  in  the  JNA,  to  be  jointly  funded  by \nGovernment and development partners, are expected to allow Georgia to respond effectively to \nthe  drastic  and  lasting  decline  in  capital  inflows  that  begun  in  2008,  and  which  the  global \nfinancial crisis has now confirmed.  \n\n26.  Within this framework, the budget support from ADB aims to ensure that, irrespective of \nany  unexpected  revenue  shocks  in  2009,  or  the  likely  cash  management  difficulties  brought \n\n\f  11\n\nabout  by  mismatches  in  the  receipt  of  revenue  and  the  time  of  expenditure  a  number  of  key \nexpenditure  programs  already  included  in  the  2009  state  budget  can  be  implemented  as \nenvisaged.  At  the  moment,  there  are  no  short-term  cash  management  options  for  the \nGovernment, as the T-bill market has been inactive.   \n\n27. \nThe review of the JNA undertaken in May 2009, led by the World Bank and the United \nNations, noted that, while budget support provided by development partners in 2008 accrued to \nthe general budget and was not earmarked for specific spending, the revised budget adopted in \nthe post-conflict period did raise spending for internally displaced persons, for social needs and \ncounter-cyclical  employment  generating  activities,  whilst  defense  outlays  were  reduced.  The \nreview also took the position that it is of critical importance that all donors translate their pledges \nfor budget support in 2009 into disbursements in a timely fashion, and to the extent donors still \nhave the flexibility to adjust the balance of their aid in 2009 towards budget support with some \nreduction in investment financing, that would be helpful to the authorities. \n\n28. \nProgram  Anchored  on  the  IMF  SBA.  The  IMF  SBA  of  $750  million  for  18  months \nprovides  balance  of  payment  support  and  will  help  to  maintain  confidence  in  the  authorities' \nmacroeconomic  policy  capacity.  Satisfactory  progress  with  the  SBA  is  a  prerequisite  for \napproval of the Program. The SBA focuses on monetary and exchange rate policy consistency \nwith  macroeconomic  external  balance,  and  on  ensuring  financial  sector  confidence,  thus \nopening space for a fiscal stimulus package to be funded by official inflows to limit the economic \nslowdown. The proposed Program will provide quick-disbursing support to meet this need.  \n\n29. \nGeorgia  urgently  needs  resources  to  enable  the  Government  to  pursue  countercyclical \nfiscal  policies  and,  given  the  monetary  and  debt  market  constraints,  the  quick-disbursing \nsupport offered by the Program is the optimal fit with the fiscal stimulus plans embodied in the \nJNA and envisaged in the 2009 budget.  \n\nIn  normal  circumstances,  ADB  program  lending  is  linked  as  closely  as  possible  to \n30. \ninstitutional reforms.  However,  in  the  case  of  Georgia,  as  in  many  other  countries,  the shocks \nare  exogenous \nthese \ncircumstances,  the  Program  has  adopted  the  policy  actions  and  benchmarks  contained  in  the \nSBA,  which  deal  directly  with  the  crisis.  Moreover,  It  is  desirable  that  the  transaction  costs  of \nany support provided by development partners be kept as small as possible.  \n\nrevealed  certain  vulnerabilities).  Under \n\nthey  have \n\n(although \n\n31. \nPolicy  Dialogue  on  Critical  Financial  Sector  Reforms.  Georgia  needs  to  undertake \ncertain critical financial sector regulatory measures immediately, which are recognized as part of \nADB  support  and  reflected  under  policy  dialogue  in  the  loan  agreement.  Working  with \ndevelopment partners, the Government will:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n \n\nintroduce regulatory framework to mitigate systemic banking risks,  \ncomplete implementation of the real-time gross settlement system,  \ndevelop the operational framework for foreign exchange auctions,  \ndesign a foreign exchange dealing system, and \nfurther develop action plan for maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability \nwith clear division of responsibilities among the relevant ministries and agencies \n(which is a prior action in the IMF SBA). \n\n32.  Monitoring of Key Expenditure Items. The Government has identified key expenditure \nitems for 2009, which the Program aims to insulate from further revenue shocks. For monitoring \nand  evaluation  purposes,  these  key  expenditure  items  have  been  agreed  by  the  Government \nand ADB and are included in the Loan Agreement (Table 6).  \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nTable 6: Key State Budget Expenditure Objectives for 2009 \n\ntransfers \n\nfor  building  and \n\nlocal  governments \n\n \n \nItem \n2009 Priority Projects Identified by the Government of Georgiaa\n1.

While the single-tranche loans \nwill  be  disbursed  upon  effectiveness.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  closely  monitor  the \nexecution  of  all  key  core  public  expenditure  programs  until  the  end  of  2009.  The  loans  are \nplanned to be fully utilized by the Government by 31 December 2009. \n \n\n3. \n\nDisbursement, Procurement, and Fiduciary Arrangements \n\n38. \nDisbursement and Procurement. Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured \nin ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 4) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of \nthe program loan will be disbursed upon effectiveness in accordance with the ADB\u2019s simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds \ndisbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the \nvalue  of  the  total  imports  of  Georgia  during  a  relevant  1-year  period,  minus  its  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch period. Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures under the Program will be permitted \nup  to  180  days  prior  to  the  loan  signing.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n\nFiduciary Arrangements. Georgia has made important progress in the last few years in \n39.  \nimplementing  public  financial  management  reforms,  which  significantly  reduce  fiduciary \nconcerns for partner organizations engaged in budget support operations. These reforms have \nbeen  a  core  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  strategy.  During  the  past  5  years, \nGeorgia has strengthened public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency by adopting \nand  implementing  reforms  that  cut  across  public  expenditure  and  financial  management, \nfiduciary controls, public procurement, public administration, and the civil service. Reforms also \nincluded  adoption  and \nframework, \nimplementation of a treasury single account and the restructuring of the Chamber of Control into \na  supreme  audit  institution.  Implementation  of  these  reforms  helped  reduce  the  national  and \n\nimplementation  of  a  medium-term  expenditure \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\ninternational  perceptions  of  corruption.  For  example,  according  to  the  World  Bank  Institute\u2019s \ngovernance indicators, Georgia\u2019s control of corruption has improved.11\n \n40. \nGeorgia\u2019s  public  expenditure  management  systems  continue  to  be  used  for  budget \nsupport operations financed by the World Bank and the EU, and regular reviews have confirmed \nthese  systems  to  be  sufficiently  robust  from  a  fiduciary  standpoint.  ADB  also  considers  the \npublic  financial  management,  control,  and  reporting  arrangements  of  the  Government  to  be \nacceptable  and  adequately  complemented  by  the  regular  state  budget  execution  reporting \nmechanisms  to  Parliament.  The  Chamber  of  Control,  the  supreme  audit  institution  of  Georgia \nwhich  reports  directly  to  Parliament,  undertakes  an  annual  audit  of  all  public  expenditure \nprograms. \n  \nConcerted public financial management reforms have been underway, with support from \n41. \ndevelopment  partners.  Based  on  progress  made  and  the  budget  implementation  systems  in \nplace,  the  fiduciary  risks  of  providing  budget  support  to  Georgia  are  considered  acceptable. \nNevertheless, as the Program will provide budget support, ADB will focus on:12\n \n\n(i)      monitoring  budget  execution,  and  in-depth  reporting  of  specific  key  expenditure \nitems (still to be defined by ADB and the Government) to ensure that these are \nimplemented as in the original 2009 budget;     \ninternal controls and audits for the specific key expenditure items; and \n\n(ii)     \n(iii)     monitoring  of  procurement  or  contracting  of  services  related  to  these  key \n \n\nexpenditure areas and programs. \n\n   \nA  financial management  specialist, to  be  recruited  through proposed  regional  technical \n42. \nassistance (footnote 15), will be engaged to work closely with the Government to implement its \ncrisis budget effectively. ADB's support will be closely coordinated with that of the World Bank. \n \n43.    The  Ministry  of  Finance,  with  NBG  assistance,  will  maintain  records  of  all  transactions \nbetween the FCA and the Treasury single account during the Program\u2019s duration, in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  practices.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  request  an  audit  of  the  use  of \ncounterpart funds, and in addition will receive a copy of the annual audited financial statements \nof the NBG together with the audited budget execution reports for 2009. The IMF has initiated \nan updated safeguards assessment of the NBG in connection with the SBA.13 The IMF update \naims to confirm the findings of the off-site monitoring and to identify any emerging safeguards \nissues.  The  NBG  publishes  financial  statements  that  have  been  audited  externally  in \n\n                                                 \n11 World Bank. 2008.

During  the  2004  assessment,  the  IMF  was  encouraged  by  the  measures  taken  by \nNBG  to  strengthen  procedures  in  the  areas  of  financial  reporting,  internal  audit,  and  cash  management. \nNonetheless,  staff  noted  further  room  for  improvement  in  these  areas,  as  well  as  weaknesses  in  aspects  of  the \ninternal  control  environment  of  NBG,  particularly  in the  foreign  exchange  management  and  accounting  functions. \nTogether,  the  IMF  and  NBG  devised  and  agreed  on  a  set  of  measures  to  improve  and  strengthen  the  NBG\u2019s \nfiduciary  arrangements.  After  update  reviews  in  2005  and  2006,  the  IMF  was  satisfied  that  the  NBG  had  fully \nimplemented all but three of the measures agreed upon in 2002.  \n\n\f  15\n\naccordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  The  overall  fiduciary  risks  are \nconsidered acceptable, taking into account the arrangements in place.   \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \n \n45. \nThe  regional  technical  assistance  being  processed  will  help  monitor  public  expenditure \nand provide feedback on any general or specific fiduciary concerns, in addition to the fiduciary \narrangements described above. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n46. \nThe  JNA  includes  transitional  results  frameworks  for  the  social  sectors,  including \nexpected outcomes, baseline data, and priority activities. Baseline indicators and targets have \nbeen  incorporated  into  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  Office  of  the \nPrime  Minister  oversees  the  overall  status  of  the  JNA.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  the \nGovernment and other JNA development partners on the status of targets and indicators under \nthe design and monitoring framework. \n \nTo enable the monitoring of implementation of outputs, the key budget expenditure items \n47. \nthat  the  Program  is  trying  to  insulate  from  negative  shocks  will  be  made  explicit  in  the  loan \ncovenants. In addition, loan covenants will require that the government will not allow arrears on \npayments  to  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  pensioners)  and  public  servants  associated  with  critical \npublic services (e.g., education, health services, law and order). \n \n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n48. \nTogether with the parallel budget support being extended in 2009 by the World Bank and \nthe European Union, the Program will relax the current constraints on a fiscal policy response to \nthe  current  crisis.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loans  will  help  the  Government \nmeet  critical  budget  public  expenditures  needs  and  to  implement  the  countercyclical  fiscal \nmeasures  already  included  in  the  2009  budget.  Development  partner  indications  of  project \nfinance  support  have  been  substantial  but  these  pledges  often  take  time  to  be  translated  into \ndelivery  of  resources.  Flexible  and  timely  financing  under  the  Program  is  essential  to  address \nthe  budgetary  needs  of  a  countercyclical  fiscal  policy  and  reduce  the  risks  of  the  economic \ndownturn.  \n\n \nThe  Program  will  join  initiatives  by  other  development  partners  designed  to  help  the \n49. \nGovernment prevent the economy from getting locked into a downward, negative growth spiral \nthat could affect social and political stability. A protracted economic downturn would also affect \nthe  medium-term  growth  potential  of  Georgia\u2019s  economy,  and  could  reverse  the  poverty \nreduction achievements of the last few years. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n50. \nThe last two quarters have revealed signs of fragility in the financial sector and resource \nshortfalls  that  may  prevent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  from  mitigating  the  current  negative \nshocks  to  economic  activity.  These  signs  of  fragility  highlight  the  importance  of  the  multi-year \nplan of physical investments and improvements in safety nets designed during the JNA exercise \n(which covers a 3-year period), funded by the Government and its development partners. The \nJNA is the only feasible framework for a policy response to the crisis. This puts more pressure \non Government's capacity to lead and coordinate the multi-development-partner effort. Also, the \nnarrowness  of  options  for  large-scale  resource  mobilization  frameworks  is  a  natural  source  of \nrisk.  \n \nThe  Government  launched  the  JNA  within  days  of  the  outbreak  of  the  August  2008 \n51. \nconflict to ensure that there was a clear strategy for keeping the focus on reforms and to secure \nthe necessary resources for remaining on track. At the same time, the Government worked with \nthe  several  development  partners  to  ensure  there  was  a  3-year  timeframe  for  the  JNA.  This \ndemonstrates  the  Government's  capacity  to  act  quickly  in  the  face  of  major  challenges,  as \nhighlighted in the recent review of the JNA:  \"the Government has managed the recovery and \nreconstruction effort with skill and determination and the results on the ground have been highly \nencouraging.\u201d  \n \n52. \nIn parallel, It is key to focus policy efforts on reducing the risk of a loss of confidence in \nthe  financial  system.  Such  a  loss  of  confidence,  especially  if  it  unfolded  in  a  disorderly  and \nuncontrolled  manner,  could  add  a  whole  new  dimension  of  disruption  to  the  economy,  and \nhamper the country's development prospects. The monetary and financial sector authorities are \ntaking  measures  to  strengthen  their  trouble  shooting,  stress-testing,  pre-emptive  and  remedial \naction capabilities. These are now policy reform priorities in Georgia and the commitment shown \nto improve risk mitigation is reassuring. \n \n53. \nEconomic  policy  must  therefore  find  ways  not  only  to  act  countercyclically  (within  the \nlimitations  imposed  by  the  widespread  use  of  the  US  dollar  in  the  economy),  but  to  avoid \nbanking sector crisis. It is crucial that the liquidity issues in specific banks do not affect overall \ndepositor confidence in the system. The covenants in the Loan Agreement are designed to deal \neffectively with these risks, and to complement ongoing technical assistance efforts. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n54. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  work  with  ADB  and  other  JNA  development  partners  to \nmonitor results, track aid, and assess the impact of support under the JNA. \nThe  Government  will  update  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the  JNA  and  will \nensure  that  necessary  support  is  provided  to  ADB  to  review  and  monitor  the \nstatus of key indicators under the design and monitoring framework.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  are  used  to  sustain \ndelivery of the Government\u2019s core publicly funded program, in compliance with its \npublic finance management procedures and reporting arrangements, satisfactory \nto ADB, and that such counterpart funds are not used to finance ineligible items \nas set forth in Appendix 4, and shall provide a certificate to ADB to this effect. \nThe  Government  will,  in  particular,  ensure  the  use  of  the  Counterpart  Funds \nand/or  provision  of  necessary  budgetary  funds  for  the  priority  budgetary \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii)  \n\n  17\n\nframework  mitigating  systemic  banking \n\nexpenditure  items  as  identified  in  the  2009  state  budget  including  the following: \nconstruction and rehabilitation of housing for internally-displaced persons (IDPs), \nroad infrastructure improvement, secondary schools, state pensions, salaries and \nacademic  stipends,  social  support  and  health  programs,  IDPs  allowances,  as \nwell as budget transfers to municipalities and local governments for purposes of \nfunding such priority items. \nThe  Government  will  through  relevant  ministries  and  agencies:  (a)  introduce \nregulatory \n(b)  complete \nimplementation of the real-time gross settlement system, (c) develop operational \nframework  for  foreign  currency  auctions,  (d)  design  foreign  exchange  dealing \nsystem,  all  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  (e)  further  develop  action  plan  for \nmaintaining \nfinancial  and  macroeconomic  stability  with  clear  division  of \nresponsibilities among Borrower's relevant ministries and agencies. \nThe  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  certified  copy  of  the  state  budget \nexecution  report  for  2009  as  submitted  to  the  Parliament  by  June  2010,  with  a \ncertified English translation of the relevant parts. The Government will furnish to \nADB a certified copy of the opinion of the Chamber of Control on such report by \nNovember 2010, with a certified English translation of the relevant parts. \nThe Government will provide ADB with a certified copy, in the English language, \nof  the  externally  audited  annual  report  of  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the fiscal year of \n2009 by June 2010. \n\nrisks, \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  are  complied  with  in  implementation  of \nactivities financed from the proceeds of the loan. \n\nVIII.

Driven  by  rapidly  rising  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI) \nflows, economic growth averaged 10.5% per year over the last 3 years and reached 12.4% in \n2007.  This  is  attributable  to  the  favorable  impact  of  the  broad  and  credible  economic  and \ngovernance  reform  agenda  being  implemented  in  Georgia  since  2003.  Over  the  last  5  years, \nGeorgia  has  implemented  far-reaching  strategic  reforms  centered  on  anticorruption  measures \nthat  have  established  strong  mechanisms  of  accountability  and  transparency  in  government. \nThe reforms aim at developing a dynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of \ngrowth, with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services\u2014\nas  seen  in  improvements  in  education  and  health  care  delivery  and  the  introduction  of  a  well-\ntargeted  social  safety  net  to  protect  the  extreme  poor.  Privatization  efforts  have  been  very \nsuccessful  in  attracting  foreign  interest  and  significant  capital  inflows,  which  resulted  in  an \nexpansion  in  economic  activity  in  a  range  of  non-tradable  sectors.  From  financial  services  to \nwholesale and retail trade, construction, hotels and restaurants, and communications, a number \nof  service  sectors  benefited  significantly  from  the  rising  household  incomes  and  the  ongoing \ndeepening of consumer lending (Figure A2.1). In 2007, strong inflows of FDI (Figure A2.2) and \nworkers\u2019  remittances  from  abroad  continued  to  accelerate  the  investment  and  consumption \ncomponents of aggregate demand (Figure A2.3), bringing economic growth to 12.4%, and the \nhighest rate of the last decade. \n \n\nFigure A2.1: Sectoral Composition of the Economy \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n0\n\n89\n\n\u201891\n\n\u201893\n\n\u201895\n\n\u201897\n\n\u201899\n\n\u201801\n\n\u201803\n\n\u201805\n\n\u201807\n\nManufacturing, value added (% of GDP) \nAgriculture, value added (% of GDP) \nServices, etc., value added (% of GDP) \nConstruction-related Industry, value added (% of GDP)\n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource:  World  Development  Indicators online  database  (World  Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008). \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  in  2006,  all  exports  from  Georgia  to  the  Russian  Federation  were  banned  by  Russian  authorities \n(e.g.,  wine,  mineral  water,  and  numerous  agricultural  products)  and  the  Georgian  economy  had  to  cope  with  a \nsharp increase in the cost of imported gas from the Russian Federation. (In 2005, the Russian Federation was both \nthe leading export market and source of imports, including energy, so the disruption caused by the embargo was \nconsiderable.)  However,  strong  internal  demand  sources,  mainly  investment  and  private  consumption,  fuelled  by \nstrong capital inflows and workers\u2019 remittances from abroad, kept the economy growing that year in excess of 9%. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A2.2: Sectoral Structure of Foreign Direct Investment in 2007 \n\nOther services\n20%\n\nAgriculture\n1%\n\nUnknow n\n16%\n\nBanking\n7%\n\nIndustry\n19%\n\n Energy\n8%\n\nConstruction\n8%\n\n Transport& \nCom m unication\n21%\n\nSource:  World  Development  Indicators  online  database  (World  Bank,  downloaded \n18 September 2008). \n\n \n\nFigure A2.3: Aggregate Demand Sources of Growth \n\n \n\n% \n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n\u201897\n\n\u201898 \n\n\u201899\n\n\u201800\n\n'01\n\n\u201802\n\n\u201803\n\n\u201804\n\n\u201805\n\n\u201806\n\n\u201807\n\nGDP growth (annual %)\n\nForeign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)\n\nHousehold final consumption expenditure (annual % growth) (RHS axis) \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: World  Development  Indicators  online  database  (World  Bank,  downloaded \n18 September 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n1,600,000,000 \n\n1,400,000,000 \n\n1,200,000,000 \n\n1,000,000,000 \n\n800,000,000 \n\n600,000,000 \n\n400,000,000 \n\n200,000,000 \n\n0\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21 \n\n \n2. \nPrudent  monetary  policies  and  fiscal  reforms  in  the  past  5  years  have  contributed  to \nmacroeconomic  stability.  The  capital  inflow  bonanza  helped  finance  the  large  current  account \ndeficit,  and  the  buildup  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  cushioned  against  shocks  affecting  the \ncurrent and capital accounts of the balance of payments. In view of the significant dollarization \nof the economy and incomplete lending channels for effectiveness of traditional monetary policy \ntools,  the  Government\u2019s  main  macroeconomic  stabilization  strategy  had  been  to  pursue \nexchange rate stabilization. This was made possible by the expanding size of foreign exchange \nreserves initiated in 2003 (Figure A2.4).  \n \n\nFigure A2.4: Official Foreign Exchange Reserve Accumulation \n\nFigure A2.5: Structure of Balance of Payments \n(all figures are net of income earned) \n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n \n\n 15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n-5%\n\n-15%\n\n0.5\n\n-10%\n\n\u201897   \u201898  \u2018 99  \n\n\u201800\n\n \n\u201801 \n\n  \n\u201802 \n\n  \n\u201803 \n\n \n\u201804 \u201805\n\n\u201806 \u201807\n\n\u201895 \u201896 \u201897 \u201898 \u201899 \u201800 \u201801 \u201802 \u201803 \u201804 \u201805 \u201806 \u201807\n\nTotal reserves minus gold (current US$) \nTotal reserves in months of imports (RHS axis) \n\nSource:  World  Development  Indicators  online  database  (World  Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008). \n\n \n\nfinancial account, (balance % GDP)\ncurrent account, (balance % GDP) \ncapital account, (balance % GDP) \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource:  International  Financial  Statistics  online  database  (International \nMonetary Fund, downloaded 18 September 2008). \n\n \n3. \nForeign equity inflows have also assisted the strong fiscal consolidation reform agenda \ninitiated in 2003, through increasing privatization proceeds. In addition, over the last few years, \nthrough  strong  improvements  in  tax  revenue  mobilization,  the  Government  has  been  able  to \nreverse  its  past  record  of  recurrent  failures  to  meet  tax  revenue  targets,  accumulation  of \ndomestic  expenditure  arrears  (including  on  pensions  and  wages),  and  cash  management \nproblems. With tax revenues increasing from 14.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to \n25.8%  of  GDP  in  2007,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  increase  social  spending  (to  more  than \n5% of GDP) assisted in establishing social safety nets, which the Government deems crucial for \nattainment  of  its  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction  agenda.  Much-needed  spending  on \npriority items (e.g., key infrastructural rehabilitation) also increased.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nFollowing  years  of  sustained  growth,  the  August  2008  conflict  resulted  in  an  uncertain \nnear-term outlook for Georgia. In early 2008, most forecasts were confident that the economic \ngrowth trend of 8% for the past few years in Georgia would continue through 2008\u20132009. The \nsituation  changed  dramatically  after  the  August  2008  conflict.  Real  GDP  growth  forecasts  for \n\nThe August Conflict \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nThe International Financial Crisis \n\n2008 changed starkly to 3% against the earlier envisaged 9.0% for 2008. A key driver for this \nwas the loss in business confidence, which in turn affected FDI in key sectors like agriculture, \ntourism,  and  energy  infrastructure.  FDI  inflows  and  related  privatization  revenues,  as  well  as \nportfolio  investment  inflows,  decelerated  sharply.  Direct  economic  damage  caused  by  the \nAugust  conflict  was  estimated  by  the  Government  to  cost  the  Georgian  economy  about \n$1 billion in damaged infrastructure and environment and lost fiscal revenues and output. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe strong macroeconomic shock initiated with the \"Sharp Slowdown\" in capital inflows \n(both FDI and private lending) that followed the August 2008 conflict is now being amplified by \nthe  slowdown  in  Georgian  export  markets  (global  economic  slowdown)  and  the  reduction  in \nincoming remittances.2 The macroeconomic outlook for Georgia has been revised downwards, \nand  remains  uncertain  at  this  stage.  From  an  expected  growth  rate  of  11-12.5%  for  2008,  as \nanticipated before the August conflict and the shocks from the international financial crisis, the \nlatest IMF estimates of 2008 GDP growth for Georgia are of 1%, and not much more for 2009 3. \nThe  combination  of  external  shocks  to  what  were  the  drivers  of  growth  in  Georgia  in  the  past \nfew years is now working its way through the economy: the collapse of demand for - and price \ngrowth in - non-tradables (the bulk of Georgian Output) that resulted from the sharp slow-down \nin  capital  inflows  is  now  decreasing  profit  margins  and  increasing  layoffs  throughout  the \neconomy.4 Pressure is naturally being put on banks' loan quality, adding to their already quite \nreduced funding options. Some sector restructuring seem to be likely in the next 1 to 2 years. \n \n6. \nWith  urban  unemployment  increasing  and  profit  margins  rapidly  shrinking,  the  loan \nrepayment  ability  of  many  borrowers  in  the  economy  has  been  seriously  affected.  With  about \nhalf  of  bank  loans  collateralized  by  real  estate,  the  possibility  of  a  price  collapse  in  this  asset \nclass is also a worrisome, although not yet realized prospect. The ratio of non-performing loans \nin  banks  has  increased  rapidly  in  the  past  few  months  at  the  same  time  that  the  private \nwholesale debt and equity market options are now less accessible for the banking sector. The \nusual  symptoms  of  liquidity  pressures  on  banks  can  be  observed,  with  anecdotal  evidence  of \nsome  banks  raising  interest-rates  on  their  time-deposits  to  secure  some  liquidity.  The  risk  of \nsystemic  difficulties  in  the  financial  system  is  still  low,  but  non  negligible.  Such  scenario,  if \neventually  unfolded,  would  significantly  exacerbate  ongoing  problems  and  add  a  whole  new \ndimension of disruption to the economy of Georgia.  \n\n                                                 \n2  The  unwinding  of  the  large  macroeconomic  imbalance  built-in  during  the  last  4-5  years  is  now  in  full  swing. \nTriggered  initially  by  a  steep  drop  in  FDI  inflows  from  August  2008  onwards  (from  $938  million  in  the  first  half  of \n2008  to  $322  million  in  the  second  half),  the  shock  is  now  being  amplified  by  the  slowdown  in  both  exports  and \ninflow of remittances.  \n\n3  The latest estimates by the Government for 2008 GDP growth are of 2.1%, and actually negative 1.5% for 2009. \n\nThese figures are still to be published. \n\n4  This is creating difficulties to the real economy, mainly to non-tradables, following the usual way of a \"Sudden-Stop\" \nin capital inflows. The usual silver lining in these episodes is brought about by the exchange-rate adjustment that \ngets the tradables sector to provide a floor to economic activity and lead the recovery, if of course it survives the \ninitial demand or financial shock. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\nFigure A2.6: Relative Price Growth for Tradable and Non-Tradable Output \n\n \nThe sharp slowdown in capital inflows causes a collapse in demand for, and price of, non-tradable output (which \nrepresents more than 70% of the Georgian economy)\u2026 \n\nRelative Price Growth for Tradable and Non-Tradable Output\n\nTHE\nWAR\n\n \n\ns\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\nh\nwt\no\nr\nG\ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\n\n \n\n18%\n\n16%\n\n14%\n\n12%\n\n10%\n\n8%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n2%\n\n0%\n\ns\ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n \n\n \n\n5\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nn\na\nJ\n\n5\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nr\nb\ne\nF\n\n5\n0\n-\nh\nc\nr\na\nM\n\n4\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\n\n5\n0\n-\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\n5\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n5\n0\n-\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\n5\n0\n-\ny\nul\nJ\n\n5\n0\n-\nt\ns\nu\ng\nu\nA\n\n5\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nt\np\ne\nS\n\n5\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\no\nt\nc\nO\n\n5\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nv\no\nN\n\n5\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\n\n6\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nn\na\nJ\n\n6\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nr\nb\ne\nF\n\n6\n0\n-\nh\nc\nr\na\nM\n\n6\n0\n-\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\n6\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n6\n0\n-\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\n6\n0\n-\ny\nul\nJ\n\n6\n0\n-\nt\ns\nu\ng\nu\nA\n\n6\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nt\np\ne\nS\n\n6\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\no\nt\nc\nO\n\n6\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nv\no\nN\n\n6\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nr\nb\ne\nF\n\n7\n0\n-\nh\nc\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\nul\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nt\ns\nu\ng\nu\nA\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nt\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\no\nt\nc\nO\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nv\no\nN\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nr\nb\ne\nF\n\n8\n0\n-\nh\nc\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\ni\nr\np\nA\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\ne\nn\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\nul\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nt\ns\nu\ng\nu\nA\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nt\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\no\nt\nc\nO\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\ne\nb\nm\ne\nc\ne\nD\n\n9\n0\n-\ny\nr\na\nu\nn\na\nJ\n\nTradables\n\nNon-Tradables\n\nFigure A2.7: Consolidated Data for Banking Sector \n\n\u2026undermining creditworthiness in the economy.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nb\ne\nF\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nr\np\nA\n\n7\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n7\n0\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n7\n0\n-\ng\nu\nA\n\n7\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n7\n0\n-\nt\nc\nO\n\n7\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n7\n0\n-\nc\ne\nD\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nb\ne\nF\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nr\np\nA\n\n8\n0\n-\ny\na\nM\n\n8\n0\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\nl\nu\nJ\n\n8\n0\n-\ng\nu\nA\n\n8\n0\n-\np\ne\nS\n\n8\n0\n-\nt\nc\nO\n\n8\n0\n-\nv\no\nN\n\n8\n0\n-\nc\ne\nD\n\n9\n0\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\nNonperforming Loans (percent of total loans)\n\nSpecific Provisions (percent of total loans)\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA)\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE)\n\n \n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. \n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nThe risk of banking difficulties has increased. It is generally recognized by participants in \n7. \nthe sector, that the growth levels in Georgian financial intermediation of the recent past will not \nbe attainable in the near future. The FSA is well aware that it is of crucial importance to make \nsure that eventual difficulties in individual banks do not trigger systemic problems. The relevant \nchallenge for Georgia (FSA) now is how to keep localized problems in any individual bank from \nbecoming widespread. These hypothetical episodes could trigger the exchange-rate pressures \nthat  can  further  erode  capital  adequacy  levels  across  all  banks  simultaneously,  and  limit  the \nability  of  NBG  to  inject  lari  liquidity  in  the  banking  system.  The  NBG  policy  must  thus  find  a \ndelicate  balance  in  current  circumstances.  As  a  central  bank,  it  should  be  ready  to  provide \nliquidity  to  temporarily-illiquid  banks,  but  simultaneously  mop  up  excess  systemic  liquidity  to \nmake sure there's no additional pressure on the lari exchange-rate.  \n \nIn the current circumstances of global financial markets, there seems to be less demand \n8. \nfor  lari  denominated  Government  medium-term  debt.  So,  unless  hard-currency  development \npartner assistance back-stops the expansionary fiscal effort, the erosion in the tax base (due to \nthe  economic  slowdown)  will  gradually  close  the  policy  space  for  the  Georgian  authorities  to \nrespond  to  the  situation.  A  fiscal  stimulus  response  is  required  to  counter  the  effect  of  the \nexternal shocks. However, the relatively high dollarization imposes, by construction, constraints \non the effectiveness of both fiscal and monetary policy. In the circumstances of Georgia, these \nconstraints can only be relaxed by (i) the back-stopping of hard-currency/long-term loans from \ndonors  (to  fund  public  spending  and  add  additional  foreign  exchange  reserves  to  the  NBG's \ntoolbox in order to back its exchange-rate policy), and the (ii) maintenance of a stable exchange \nrate  (at  least  avoid  sharp  changes  in  lari  value).  A  pre-condition  for  the  above  described \nrelaxation  is  to  (iii)  keep  stability  in  the  banking  system  and  avoid  the  exacerbation  of  shocks \nthrough a banking crisis, as discussed above. \n \n9. \nGeorgian  State  Budget. The Government submitted the 2009 budget to Parliament in \nDecember  2008.  The  budget  was  based  on  an  assumption  of  2.0\u20132.5%  economic  growth  for \n2009 (Table A2). Table A2 also presents budget execution in 2008 for comparison. Overall, the \nGovernment  has  tried  to  compress  recurrent  state  expenditures  (reflected  in  a  projected \ndecrease  in  goods  and  services  expenditure  and  grants  to  local  administration,  with  a  small \nincrease in recurrent capital expenses and subsidies) and to increase public investment.   \n \n10. \nA  key  feature  of  the  2009  budget  is  the  budgeted  draw-down  of  the  state's  cash \nbalances  deposited  at  the  NBG  in  the  amount  of  GEL522.2  million.  This  presents  risks  to  the \nnormal  functioning  of  expenditure  programs,  which  in  the  current  circumstances  should  be \navoided.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  Government's  budget  for  2009  was  presented  and \napproved with a zero ex-post financing gap.  \n \n11. \nBased  on  ADB's  commitments  in  late  2008,  $40  million  had  already  been  tentatively \nbudgeted  by  the  Government  as  a  new  net  lending  item,  corresponding  to  about  GEL66.5 \nmillion.  The  same  amount  was  also  budgeted  to  take  into  account  the  World  Bank's  new \ndevelopment policy operation to be approved in June 2009. \n \nIn  view  of  the  shortfall  in  budget  revenues  already  recognized  for  the  first  quarter  of \n12. \n2009, and the delays in execution of some donor-funded investment projects, the Government \nhas  requested  several  donors  to  increase  the  amounts  of  budget  support  operations  being \nprocessed,  and  to  the  extent  possible  shift  already  committed  project-related  assistance  onto \ngeneral  budget  assistance.  The  schedule  submission  of  a  revised  2009  State  Budget  to  the \nGeorgian Parliament is in July. The execution of the first quarter already shows signs of worse \nmacroeconomic  conditions  than  expected  last  December:  net  of  tax  payments  made  by  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nMinistry of Defense for taxes due in 2008, the 2009 tax revenue collection was 11.4% below the \nsame period in 2008. \n\nTable A2: Georgia State Budget \n\n \n \nItem \nTotal Revenues \nTotal (recurrent) Expenses \nIncrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Public Investment) \nDecrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Privatization Proceeds) \n\nNet Change in Financial Assets \n \n\nNet Change in Obligations \n \n\nTotal State Budget Balance \n\nof which, NBG deposit withdrawals are \n\nof which, from WB and ADBa\nof which Eurobonds \nof which from other borrowing sources \nFunding \nFinancing Gap \n\n2008  \n(execution) \n(GEL million) \n5,517.6 \n5,551.6 \n   893.4 \n   568.8 \n  (358.6) \n\n  603.6 \n \n  (416.3) \n  962.2 \n \n  208.9 \n  724.0 \n  140.3 \n  (358.6) \n       0.0 \n\n2009  \n(budget) \n(GEL million) \n5,510.2 \n5,252.0 \n   996.7 \n     78.3 \n   (660.2) \n\n \n\n  (568.3) \n \n  522.2 \n    91.9 \n \n 133.0 \n     0.0 \n403.6 \n(660.2) \n    0.0 \n\n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, WB = World Bank. \na 133 GEL million were already budgeted for in 2009, corresponding to $40 million from the World Bank and $40 \nmillion from the Asian Development Bank. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n \nD. \n\nThe Policy Challenge \n\n13.  Macroeconomic adjustment in Georgia is underway, especially when the economy was \nrunning a 20% current account deficit and suffers a sharp slow-down in the capital inflows that \nwere  funding  it.  A  highly  dollarized,  small  and  open  economy  doesn't  have  an  ample  policy \nspace to fully offset major negative shocks to foreign capital-induced domestic spending. It can \nhowever  target  its  limited  policy  tools  in  the  direction  of  key  social  or  financial  stability \nobjectives. Developing countries' financial crises have always led to sharp increases in poverty \nlevels, and for significant reversals in gains made by economic growth. \n \n\nBox A2: Lessons from Emerging Markets \n\nThe relevant problem for economic policy in this sort of macroeconomic episodes is then not merely to find ways to \nact  counter-cyclically  (within  the  limitations  imposed  by  high  dollarization)  in  order  to  absorb  part  of  the  external \nshocks (by trying to expand the fiscal and monetary policy space), but above all to avoid that such macroeconomic \nadjustment  is  exacerbated  by  difficulties  in  the  financial  sector.  In  other  words,  although  the  primary  shocks  can \nimpact on the financial sector (in terms of portfolio quality and liquidity risks), it is crucial to avoid that liquidity issues \nin specific banks can at some point become problems of overall insolvency in the banking system.  \n \nHistorically,  full-fledged  banking  crises  in  emerging  markets  have  imposed  high  fiscal  costs.  To  highlight  the  fiscal \ndimension of these challenges, it must be stated that it wouldn't be a mere issue of a funding gap in the state budget \nresulting  from  lower  revenue  proceeds  and  higher  public  spending.  In  general,  banking  sector  problems  have  the \npotential of affecting monetary institutions in developing countries. In many cases, the recovery of assets previously \npledged by problematic banks as collateral to central banks is significantly smaller than the value of the loans (plus \ninterest) provided in the midst of the crises. On average, the length of a banking crisis is 4.5  years, at a resolution \ncost of 13.6% of GDP.5  \n\n                                                 \n5   Estimates  were  extracted  from  a  set  of  ninety  episodes  since  the  1970s  till  1996  by  G.  Caprio  and  D.  Klingebiel \n\n1996. Bank Insolvency: Cross-Country Experiences. World Bank Policy & Research Paper Number 1574. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nThe global liquidity crisis that has ensued since October 2008 is exerting some funding \n14. \npressures in the Georgian banking sector.6 This is adding foreign exchange liquidity concerns to \ndeteriorating  loan  portfolio  quality  conditions  in  banks.  Several  donors  have  been  providing \nliquidity  support  to  banks,  and  important  international  creditors  have  taken  equity  positions  in \nsome  of  the  commercial  banks.  The  NBG  and  the  FSA  have  also  been  relaxing  liquidity  and \nreserve  requirements  and  providing  some  short-term  liquidity  support  to  financial  institutions \n(enabled by the much-praised countercyclical stance of the recent past). \n \nAggregate  capital  adequacy  levels  in  the  Georgian  banking  system  are  high,  but \n15. \nconcerted and sound oversight needs to be ensured. In a fractional reserve system \u2013 as modern \nbanking systems are - it is literally impossible for all depositors to convert at the same time their \ndeposits  into  currency  (irrespective  of  the  levels  of  capital)  unless  there  is  some  source  of \nadditional  currency  to  banks.  The  latter  usually  acts  as  an  implicit  form  of  insurance  for \ndepositors. The latter would usually come from the central bank in the form of liquidity support. \nBut  that  is  somehow  limited  in  highly  dollarized  economies.  Therefore,  both  the  NBG  and  the \nFSA are keeping a very close oversight effort to ensure overall public confidence in the banking \nsystem. \n \n16. \nThe  FSA  is  taking  steps  to  further  strengthen  its  supervisory  powers.  Specifically, \neffective Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) systems need to be put in place to fit the discretionary \nneeds  of  the  FSA.  This  is  crucial  even  in  good  times.  A  fast-tracked  review  of  the  financial \nsector  architecture  has  been  done  recently,  with  ADB  assistance,  to  highlight  essential  steps, \nsuch  as  improving  the  quality  of  financial  reporting  by  banks  and  external  auditing.  The  FSA \nshould  improve  the  legal  foundations  and  the  necessary  financial  and  technical  resources  to \nimplement bank resolution and restructuring in an orderly fashion. These challenges come at a \ncritical  juncture  for  the  FSA.  The  FSA  has  just  been  set-up  (less  than  a  year  ago)  with  new \noperational  systems  and  procedures,  with  the  expanded  responsibility  of  consolidated \nsupervision for the entire financial system, and with a (prudential) regulatory framework that is \nundergoing important adjustments. The FSA seems to require both key technical assistance as \nwell  as  programmatic  backup  to  support  its  decisions  against  pressures  from  the  industry.  As \ninternational  experience  has  shown,  while  effectively  performed  financial  system  oversight \nfunctions are needed in \"good\" times, they become of key importance in times of distress. \n \n17. \nShortage  of  liquidity  management  instruments  and  limited  fiscal  space.  There  is \nyet no domestic public debt issuance practice in Georgia (not even short-term). As a result, the \ndynamics  of  public  spending  is  effected  by  seasonality  in  fiscal  revenues.  This  affects  the \nlaunch  of  domestically-financed  new  capital  expenditure  projects  as  a  fiscal  response  to  the \neconomic slowdown. Although T-Bills were issued in the past in Georgia - as most governments \ndo for cash management purposes and as a monetary policy instrument - the auctions program \nwas  discontinued  in  June  2005.  It  is  now  important  to  re-enact  a  new  auctions  framework  for \nshort-term  liquidity  management  of  the  Georgian  Treasury  and  the  banking  sector.  This  could \nbe  done  quickly,  and  would  also  provide  a  much-needed  platform  for  operational  coordination \nwith  monetary  policy  in  these  difficult  times.  Without  this  additional  form  of  collateral  in  the \nhands  of  banks  (t-bills  instead  of  lari  cash),  the  effectiveness  of  the  NBG's  short-term  liquidity \nwindow to assist banks in their liquidity management is limited (only foreign exchange and NBG \nCertificates of Deposit can currently be accepted as collateral by the NBG's weekly refinancing \nfacility). \n\n                                                 \n6   Although  foreign  net  private  equity  and  lending  inflows  to  banks  had  been  around  $681  million  in  the  first  half  of \n2008,  they  were  negative  in  the  second  half  of  2008,  and  are  now  expected  to  remain  relatively  low  throughout \n2009. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n18. \nExchange-Rate  Policy  Trade-Offs  and  Operational  Issues.  The  NBG  is  now  faced \nwith  the  challenge  of  smoothing  steep  variations  in  the  exchange-rate  and  at  the  same  time \navoiding the erosion of its foreign exchange reserves stock. The operational framework that the \nNBG  used  in  the  recent  past  for  its  exchange  rate  interventions  was  ineffective  and  added  a \ngreat  deal  of  uncertainty  to  policy,  as  it  didn't  allow  NBG  policymakers  to  distinguish  between \nequilibrium  changes  in  the  exchange-rate  and  the  sheer  speculation  by  banks  and  foreign \nexchange traders against the lari. Important changes to this operational framework have already \nbeen  implemented.  A  framework  for  foreign  exchange  auctions  has  been  introduced  in  March \n2009.  A  multi-pricing  auctions  system  and  a  normal  dealing  platform  for  all  foreign  exchange \ntrades is being developed. \n \nSettlement  Limitations  and  Settlement  Failure-Induced  Liquidity  Risks.  Another \n19. \nchallenge in the context of the operational infrastructure of the financial system is to avoid that \nany  failures  in  settling  payments  between  banks  can  trigger  liquidity  shortages  in  individual \nbanks. The current payment system (no systems of substance other than the inter-bank RTGS, \nwhich  is  of  outdated  technology,  with  limited  linkages,  and  can  be  prone  to  delays)  has  been \noperating with limitations and not without problems. It hasn't been critically important to upgrade \nup  to  now  because  volumes/values  in  the  system  were  fairly  small.  But  in  the  current \ncircumstances, it is crucial to assure the participants in the payment system of a low settlement \nrisk.  Any  liquidity  shortage  in  a  bank  can  be  mistaken  by  depositors as  a  solvency  issue,  and \ntrigger  loss  of  confidence  in  the  overall  payment  system.  The  finalization  of  the  New-RTGS \nImplementation  Plan  is  a  priority  of  the  NBG.  This  is  key  as  well  in  terms  of  NBG's  role  in \nmanaging  the  current  situation.  The  current  system  lacks  some  necessary  features,  like  the \nability  to  automatically  provide  intra-day  (or  overnight  if  necessary)  liquidity.  The  NBG  is \ncurrently upgrading its payments system which will substantially improve the reliability, usability \nand speed of domestic payments. \n\n \n\nDebt Sustainability \n\nE. \n \n20. \nIn  November  2006,  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  jointly \nperformed  a  debt  sustainability  analysis  to  Georgia.  That  analysis  (the  2006  Joint  DSA) \nhighlighted  what  had  been  the  key  achievements  of  the  Georgian  authorities  in  reducing  the \nburden of its external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt from a level of about 80% of \nGDP in 1994, to less than 30% at the end of 2005.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nFigure A2.8: Debt Indicators \n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\nR\nY\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\nR\nY\n\nDebt service (PPG and IMF only, % of exports, excluding w orkers' remittances) (LHS\naxis)\nExternal debt stocks (% of GNI) (RHS axis)\n\nCentral government debt, total (% of GDP) (RHS axis)\n\nIMF  =  International  Monetary  Fund,  GNI  =  gross  national  income,  GDP  = \ngross  domestic  product,  LHS  =    left-hand  side,  PPG  =    public  and  publicly \nguaranteed, RHS = right hand side.                                . \nSource: World Development Indicators. \n\n \n\n21.  With the exception of a hike in debt burden indicators during 1999 owing to the effects \non  economic  growth  from  that  year's  Russian  economic  crisis  and  the  consequent  and  sharp \ndepreciation of the Gel against the US dollar, the decade-long trend of external debt reduction is \nclearly very strong. Georgia's external public debt at the end of 2005 was equivalent to 92% of \nexports in NPV terms. In 1998, about 23% of export receipts were needed to service the PPG \ndebt  (see  Graph  above),  but  by  2007  that  ratio  was  only  4%.  Several  factors  determined  this \noutcome:  \n \n\nstrong economic growth;  \nrestrained and more rationalized Government borrowing towards a higher degree \nof  concessionality,  in  the  sense  that  the  past  practice  of  resorting  to  expensive \nbilateral  debt  was  discontinued  and  multilateral  assistance  was  privileged  as  a \nbudget funding source; and  \na reschedule of the repayment of liabilities to Turkmenistan related to the energy \nbill.  \n\n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nAs  a  result  of  these  debt  policy  and  macroeconomic  achievements,  in  2006  the  DSA \n22. \nconsidered  Georgia's  debt  distress  risk  to  be  low,  with  no  expected  changes  to  this  outlook \naccording  to  the  projections  and  assumptions  made  on  that  exercise.  It  also  pointed  out  that \n\"the CPIA for Georgia (had) been upgraded from medium to strong performer in June 2006 due \nto the recent improvement in the policy and institutional performance\".  \n\nFigure A2.9: CPIA Debt Policy Rating (1 = low to 6 = high) \n\nGeorgia \nKyrgyz Republic \nMoldova\nSri Lanka\nTajikistan\nZimbabwe \n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nSource: World Development Indicators. \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007\n\n \n\n23. \nThe  same  exercise  did  however  make  explicit  that  some  debt  indicators  remained \nvulnerable  to  stress  testing  of  key  variables.  Although  most  scenarios  tested  (in  terms  of \ndifferent potential shocks) would not jeopardize Georgia's debt sustainability, the NPV of debt-\nto-exports  ratio  seemed  particular  sensitive  to  a  temporary  decline  of  export  value  growth \n(Georgia's main export commodity was scrap metal, which is particularly prone to price swings, \nand other export items such as Georgian wine, mineral water, tea and citrus fruits had just been \naffected  by  a  Russia  imposed  import  ban).  Nonetheless,  the  main  source  of  risk  to  fiscal \nsustainability  identified  in  the  2006  Joint  DSA  was  an  unexpected  decline  in  GDP  growth, \nreason why the exercise's recommendation was for the authorities to \"continue (strengthening) \ncompetitiveness  of  their  tradable  sector  and  (improving)  the  business  climate  to  support \nbaseline growth.\" \n \n24. \n2007  was  a  year  of  strong  economic  growth,  and  all  near-term  economic  growth \nprospects  deemed  debt-sustainability  to  remain  a  non-issue,  especially  given  the  expectation \nthat the Government would continue its practice of borrowing at high concessional terms. The \nstrong  macroeconomic  shocks  caused  by  the  August  2008  conflict  and  the  international \nfinancial crisis have jointly resulted in a sharp slowdown in capital inflows (both FDI and private \nlending). These shocks are being amplified by the slowdown in Georgian export markets (global \neconomic  slowdown)  and  the  reduction  in  incoming  remittances.  All  major  components  of \naggregate  demand  in  the  economy  are  thus  contracting  and  the  macroeconomic  outlook  for \nGeorgia  has  been  revised  downwards,  remaining  at  this  stage  uncertain.  From  an  expected \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\ngrowth  rate  of  11-12.5%  for  2008,  as  anticipated  before  the  August  conflict  and  the  domestic \nimpact  of  the  international  financial  crisis  in  the  last  quarter  of  2008,  the  2008  GDP  growth \noutcome is 2.1%, and the current forecast for 2009 is of negative growth. \n\n \n\nThese compounding shocks called for renewed monitoring of macroeconomic conditions \n25. \nand  further  debt  scenario  testing.  In  September  2008,  the  IMF  staff  updated  the  2006  Joint \nDSA, into an External and Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (the 2008 DSA). This 2008 \nDSA also attempted at incorporating a shift in the debt management policy of the Government \nto  reflect  the  fact  that  the  Government  had  earlier  in  the  year  undertaken  a  $500  Million \nEurobond issuance.  \n \n26. \nA DSA done in September 2008 and an update undertaken in March 2009 by the IMF \nshow  that  Georgia's  external  debt  is  low.  Although  external  financing  for  post-conflict \nreconstruction  may  increase  the  debt  ratios  over  the  next  two  years,  the  debt  outlook  is \nexpected  to  recover  and  improve  over  the  medium  term.  Georgia's  key  medium-term  risks \ninvolve  large  debt  service  in  2012\u20132013  associated  with  the  repayments  to  the  IMF  under  its \nrecent SBA and the 2008 Eurobond. \n \n27. \nDespite  the  substantial  external  financing  in  2008\u201310,  the  low  initial  indebtedness  and \nthe  concessionality  of  official  inflows  limit  the  risk  that  debt  levels  will  become  unsustainable. \nRoughly  40  percent  of  official  financing  is  expected  in  grants,  and  some  loans  are  on \nconcessional terms. As a result, public external debt is projected to peak at around 30 percent \nof  GDP  in  2011  with  its  NPV  amounting  to  78  percent  of  exports.  Although  nominal  private \nsector external debt is set to remain broadly constant in 2009, debt ratios will rise on account of \nthe economic contraction and exchange rate depreciation. Assuming an improvement of global \ncredit conditions in 2010, the private sector should regain capital market access, resulting in a \ngradual  build-up  of  private  debt.  In  terms  of  debt  management,  2013  appears  to  be  the  most \nchallenging  year,  as  the  $500  million  Eurobond  matures  and  repurchases  under  SBA \nobligations peak. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFigure A2.10: Economic Events in Georgia \n \n \n \n \n \n[This information was deemed confidential according to exceptions #6 and #18 of paragraph 126 of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2005)]. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n\n \n\n3\n1\n\n\fFigure A2.11: Problem Tree \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[This information was deemed confidential according to exceptions #6 and #18 of paragraph 126 of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2005)]. \n\n3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSector/Thematic \nArea \nGovernance \nand Public Sector \nManagement \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n 33\n\nDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS MATRIX  \n \n\nWorld Bank.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program aims to raise the welfare of the population \nin Georgia. To achieve this goal, two self-enforcing and strategic objectives have been defined: (i) fast and sustainable \neconomic development, and (ii) reduction of poverty. To achieve these strategic objectives, the Government\u2019s priorities \ninclude  (i)  improvement  in  governance  (including  improvement  in  public  administration  and  reduction  of  corruption), \n(ii) macroeconomic stability, (iii) improvement in the structural and institutional environment (including improvement in \nthe  business  and  investment  climate),  (iv)  development  of  human  capital  through  improving  health  conditions,  and \n(v) improving living standards for those below the poverty line and reducing vulnerability levels.  \n \nThe  current  threats  to  macroeconomic  stability  represent  a  risk  to  the  sustainability  of  progress  along  the  remaining \nreform  priorities  of  the  Government.  Social  instability  and  spillover  effects  to  political  uncertainty  can  jeopardize  past \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  achievements,  as  well  as  past  and  still  ongoing  progress  in  institutional  reforms.  The \nProgram  will  help  cushion  the  impact  on  the  expenditure  program  (structure,  levels  and  rhythm)  from  the  negative \nrevenue  shocks,  by  ensuring  that:  (i)  incremental  expenditure  needs  arising  from  worse-than-expected  economic \nconditions in mid-2009 are met by the Government without complete withdrawal of cash balances at the National Bank \nGeorgia, and (ii) the delivery of the core Government expenditure program for 2009 in accordance with the approved \nbudget,  irrespective  of  any  subsequent  revisions  to  take  into  account  potential  shortfalls  in  revenue.  In  the  current \ncircumstances,  to  avoid  a  free  fall  in  economic  activity,  the  countercyclical  fiscal  policy  that  the  Program  aims  to \nsupport is directly in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy objectives.  \n \nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Banka (ADB) is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  social  development,  and  (iii)  good  governance.  ADB\u2019s  interim  operational  strategy  for  Georgia  (2008\u2013\n2009),b  approved  in  January  2008,  focuses  on  (i)  improving  service  delivery  in  municipal  infrastructure  within  the \nevolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road transportation constraints on economic activity, and (iii) upgrading \nand  developing  energy  infrastructure.  These  priorities  were  identified  based  on  the  following  considerations:  (i) \nalignment with the Government\u2019s development agenda, (ii) selectivity in focusing limited resources on a small number \nof  priority  areas,  and  (iii)  complementarity  with  other  development  partners.  The  interim  operational  strategy  also \nhighlights the need for ADB to be responsive to rapid changes in circumstances, and the flexibility of ADB assistance \nmodalities\u2014a key advantage for Georgia\u2019s development under its newly established partnership with ADB.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUsing consumption as a welfare indicator and following World Bank methodology for poverty measurement, 23.6% of \nGeorgians were found to be poor and 9.3% very poor. The rural population was poorer than the urban: 29.7% versus \n18.3%  for  overall  poverty  and  12.4%  versus  6.7%  in  the  case  of  extreme  poverty.  Poverty  in  Georgia  is  thus \npredominantly  rural\u2014it  makes  59%  of  the  total  poor  and  62%  of  the  extreme  poor.  The  incidence  of  poverty  varies \nconsiderably across Georgia. The highest incidence is observed in Shida Kartli (59.4%), followed by Kakheti (46.3%), \nand  Mtskheta-Mtianeti  (40.6%).  The  lowest  incidence  of  poverty  is  found  in  Tbilisi  (12.9%),  Samegrelo  (14.4%),  and \nKvemo-Kartli  (17.3%).  Employment  status  is  strongly  correlated  with  poverty.  Households  headed  by  wage  earners \nexperience the lowest rates of overall poverty (12.7%) and extreme poverty (4.4%). Among the employed, households \nheaded by the self-employed in agriculture face the highest poverty risk. In contrast, households headed by someone \nwho is unemployed or out of the labor force face a substantial risk of poverty. \n \nAn assessment of the impact of economic growth and social spending on poverty from current shocks is under  way. \nOfficial poverty indicators show some improvement over 2005\u20132007, with the overall poverty rate declining from 24.1% \nin 2005 to 23.3% in 2006 and 21.3% in 2007. However, the quality of the data is a concern, stemming partly from rapid \nturnover in staff in the Statistics Department. As a cross-check, the World Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social \nProtection  conducted  a  living  standards  measurement  survey  in  Fall  2007,  and  preliminary  analysis  of  the  results \nshows an overall poverty rate of 23.6% for 2007. A full poverty assessment to be undertaken in FY2009 is tasked to \n\n \n\n\f36 \n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\ndiscuss  the  differences,  and  suggest  strategic  policy  and  investment  options  for  poverty  reduction  efforts.  However, \nsome observations can be made at this time. The rapid increase in social spending, including the introduction of the \ntargeted social assistance program in 2006, has likely improved the situation of the extreme poor. Additionally, poverty \nappears to be more concentrated in rural areas and secondary cities. \n \nThe conflict that erupted in August 2008 has resulted to an additional 130,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), of \nwhich about 40,000 may not be able to return to their homes in the conflict zone. In addition, around 150,000 people \nliving  on  farms  on  the  agricultural  plain  north  of  Gori  are  suffering  from  severe  crop  and  livestock  losses  because \nirrigation water was cut off and other conflict-related damage. Preliminary estimates point to unemployment increasing \nfrom 13.3% in 2007 to 15.1%\u201317.4% in 2008. The shock from the international financial crisis is likely to have deeper \nand more widespread social effects though. These are however difficult to quantify. The near-term outlook is of a rise in \nunemployment,  with  a  likely  increase  in  overall  poverty  incidence.  People  who  are  already  poor  might  be  pushed \ndeeper  into  poverty,  thus  increasing  the  overall  poverty  gap  and  severity  of  poverty.  The  several  scenarios  of  social \nand  poverty impact estimated in the JNA  are being revised and  will be presented for reference  in further versions  of \nthis RRP.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe  Program  is,  as  pro-poor  in  design  and  impact  as  the  Government's  Budget  Execution  for  2009  will  be,  and  the \nlatter is in alignment with the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) carried out jointly by Government and donor partners in \n2008.  In  view  of  the  current  macroeconomic  circumstances,  both  the  JNA  and  the  Government's  budget  layout  a \nprogram  of  expenditures  that  includes  both  the  strengthening  of  safety-nets,  but  also  expenditure  items  that  can \nmaximize employment generation, and mitigation of poverty impacts from the ongoing crisis. \n \nThe JNA identifies the need for intervention and donor assistance in three major areas: (i) help the Government ensure \nthat  critical  economic  and  social  needs  are  met  and  confidence  is  maintained,  with  budget  support  (through  quick \ndisbursement)  to  back-stop  countercyclical  fiscal  measures  with  rapid  effect;  (ii)  support  for  critical  new  public \ninvestments;  and  (iii)  resettlement  of  internally  displaced  persons  and  the  post-conflict  needs  of  affected  populations \nare  likely  to  continue  requiring  significant  support.  In  accordance  with  the  JNA,  certain  high-value  and  high-yield \ninvestments are key to maximize recovery prospects with lasting positive effects on the economy's productive capacity. \n \nThe  country  urgently  needs  resources  to  adopt  counter-cyclical  fiscal  policies.  Given  that  the  fiscal  stimulus  plans \nembodied  in  the  JNA  and  envisaged  for  2009  in  the  Government's  2009  Budget  were  designed  within  a  clearly \ncountercyclical conceptual framework, and several monetary and debt market constraints in Georgia dictate that only \nquickly-disbursed donor assistance in the form of hard currency budget support can help materialize those plans, the \nherein proposed operation is an optimal fit to the circumstances. \n \nThe key elements of Georgia\u2019s social protection system are summarized below. \n \nTargeted  social  assistance.  In  August  2006,  following  18  months  of  intense  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding, the Government of Georgia introduced a targeted social assistance (TSA) system. The system uses a proxy-\nmeans  testing  methodology  for  assessing  and  ranking  the  welfare  of  households,  which  have  registered  with  the \ndatabase on the poor and vulnerable population established and managed by the State Agency for Administration of \nSocial Transfers. The agency\u2019s database currently contains data on 42% of all households in Georgia. \n \nAll  of  these  households  had  registered  with  the  agency  as  households  in  need  of  support.  They  were  visited  by  a \nqualified social worker who collected data on the household\u2019s economic and social status, the data was electronically \nverified and cross-checked, \u201ca score of need\u201d  was automatically calculated for each  household, and each household \nwas  formally  informed  about  it.  Households  with  a  score  below  57,000  receive  regular  monthly  income  support.  In \nAugust 2008, this benefit was received by 148,279 households with 406,718 members (10.7% of the population); the \naverage monthly benefit per household was GEL50.92. The total spending on targeted income support was budgeted \nat GEL113.1 million for 2008 (about 0.6% of projected gross domestic product). In 2007, a monitoring survey to assess \nthe performance of TSA was carried out. The survey found that TSA is efficiently administered and performs very well \nin reaching the target poor population. \n \nPensions.  Georgia  has  a  universal  system  of  income  support  for  the  elderly,  where  eligibility  is  conditioned  upon \nreaching a certain age threshold\u201460 for women and 65 for men. Other categories covered by the system are people \nwith  disabilities  and  families  that  have  lost  a  breadwinner.  Benefits  are  flat  (currently  GEL70  per  month),  except  for \nsome special categories such as war veterans, retired officers from the army and the Ministry of Interior, members of \nParliament, and others who receive much higher amounts. Overall, 838,130 people received pensions in August 2008. \nTotal spending on pensions and special categories benefits in 2008 is budgeted at GEL773.5 million (state pensions \nGEL722.7 million and special allowances GEL50.8 million). Pensions are delivered on time and the conflict has not had \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n  37\n\nany adverse impact on their delivery so far. \n \nMedical  assistance  program  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable. All households that are registered with the agency and \nwhose  score  is  below  70,000  are  beneficiaries  of  the  medical  assistance  program.  This  program  is  essentially  a \npackage  of  medical  services  provided  to  beneficiaries  through  a  publicly  financed  insurance  premium  (currently \nGEL11.2  per  capita  per  month;  projected  to  increase  to  GEL15  in  2009).  Currently,  750,000  Georgians  are \nbeneficiaries of this program. The program is funded by the state budget (for 2008, the amount is budgeted at GEL75.0 \nmillion, making up about one third of overall public spending on health in Georgia). \n \nSocial care services: The system of social care services in Georgia is limited and mostly focused on children deprived \nof parental care and children with disabilities. Georgia is in the process of implementing a child welfare reform aimed at \ndeinstitutionalization of child care. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social sectors in Georgia were confronted with a number of structural, institutional, policy, and governance issues \nthat needed to be addressed to improve performance and outcomes. Resources spent on social assistance programs \nwere  insufficient  to  make  a  real  difference  to  the  extremely  poor.  Moreover,  they  were  thinly  spread  over  too  many \nfragmented  programs,  targeted  mostly  based  on  status,  merits  (veterans  and  other  deserving  citizens),  or  a  social \ncategory (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Program implementation was weak, the staff were poorly trained and paid, \nthe record-keeping practice was outdated, benefit delivery had room for leakage, and monitoring and evaluation barely \nexisted.  \n \nEven  though  social  transfers  are  not  sufficient  to  move  households  out  of  poverty,  they  play  an  important  role  in \npoverty alleviation (particularly pensions as the largest program). The new Government inherited significant arrears in \npensions  and  other  social  benefit  payments.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  major  challenges  facing  the  state  pension \nsystem are (i) to continue paying pensions on time, (ii) to increase pensions to about 25%\u201330% of the average wage \n(from a replacement rate of about 20%), and (iii) to improve pension administration. In the long run, Georgia faces a \nchallenge  of  developing  an  affordable,  fiscally  sustainable,  diversified  pension  system  that  would  protect  the  elderly \nagainst poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. Under the new Government\u2019s program, pensions and social \nassistance benefits were significantly increased, all arrears were cleared, and payment of these benefits commenced \non  a  regular  basis.  In  pensions,  a  strategy  for  long-term  pension  reform  was  adopted,  and  the  corresponding  legal \nframework  was created for an affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection of the elderly  against poverty. \nOverall, the pension system was simplified and streamlined. \n \nThe  health  sector  continues  to  face  significant  challenges.  Health  outcomes  are  stagnant  or  are  worsening.  Early \nchildhood mortality and maternal mortality have  yet to show  a positive trend. Noncommunicable diseases are on the \nrise. Out-of-pocket expenditures for treatment are still a major barrier to seeking care. The new Government\u2019s program \naims to sustain improved health care services. Increased public financing for health care and better targeting of primary \ncare to the poor are gradually improving the utilization of health care services.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were conducted with the Government [including the Ministry of Finance (MOF); National Bank \nof Georgia; Financial Supervisory Agency; Revenue Service]; private sector (including American Chamber of \nCommerce, Bank Republic/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale); and other development partners (including World Bank, United States \nAgency for International Aid, German development cooperation through GTZ, European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, European Union). \n \n2.

These \nreforms  have  resulted  in  the  improvement  of  PFM  indicators  for  Georgia,  as  indicated  by  the \nWorld Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (See Figure A6). \n \n\nFigure A6: Country Policy and Institutional Assessment \n\n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n1.0 \n\n- \n\n \n\ni\n\n \n)\nt\ns\ne\nh\ng\nh\n=\n \n6\n \n,\nt\ns\ne\nw\no\n\nl\n \n\n=\n \n1\n(\n \ng\nn\ni\nt\na\nR\n\n \n\n2005\n2006\n2007\n\n \n\nDebt policy \n\nEconomic \nmanagement \n\nEfficiency of\nrevenue\nmobilization\n\nEquity of public\nresource use\n\nFiscal policy Public sector\nmanagement \nand institutions\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators database. \n\n.\n\nQuality of\nbudgetary and\nfinancial\nmanagement\n\n \n \n2. \nBudgeting Reforms. The centerpiece of budget reforms is the introduction of multi-year \nbudget through the development of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This has \nresulted  in  a  fiscal  framework  that  outlines  fiscal  projections  linked  to  medium-term  policy \ndirections  and  economic  conditions.  These  are  contained  in  the  published  Basic  Data  and \nDirections  Document  (BDD).  The  BDD  for  2009-12  was  published  in  July  2008.  The \nGovernment has rolled out MTEF to all ministries, except for the Ministry of Interior. However, \nthe  BDD  needs  further  improvement  and  should  be  extended  to  include  realistic  resource \nceilings for subsequent budget planning. The BDD also needs to be more widely disseminated. \nThe  MTEF  reform  has  also  resulted  in  the  development  of  performance  indicators  for  some \nsectoral  programs.  Reforms  have  also  moved  towards  the  linkage  between  the  annual \nbudgeting and the MTEF. This has resulted in better policy content in the budget. \n\n \n3. \nTreasury Management and Accounting Reforms. Georgia had been saddled with off-\nbudget  revenues  and  expenditures,  which  in  turn  hampered  budget  execution  and  increased \nfiduciary  risks.  To  address  this,  a  Treasury  Single  Account  for  the  central  government  was \n\n\f40 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nestablished to help track the flow of funds.  The Government also adopted Rules and guidelines \nfor Treasury operations at the central and decentralized level. \n\n \n4. \nTreasury  reforms  were  complemented  by  accounting  reforms.  New  accounting \nstandards were likewise introduced. The Government adopted and began implementation of an \naccounting  reform  strategy  for  producing  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  in  line  with \ninternally  accepted  accounting  and  reporting  standards.  Consolidated  cash  and  commitment \nreports for the central government and large cities are now being prepared. Financial reporting \nwas further strengthened by the implementation of functional budget classifications in line with \nthe  IMF\u2019s  Government  Finance  Statistics  (GFS)  Manual  2001.  As  such,  the  Treasury \nmanagement information system is producing GFS-compliant state budget execution reports. \n \nThe Government has also improved its cash management systems. Treasury\u2019s rules and \n5. \nprocedures  on  cash  planning  and  management  have  been  significantly  improved.  Also,  the \nTreasury's cash management system has been linked with National Bank of Georgia's real time \nsettlement  system  resulting  in  better  predictability  of  available  resources  and  its  allocation  to \nspending units. Also, the Government has acquired an electronic payment documents exchange \nsystem  has  been  acquired  and  is  currently  being  customized  at  the  Treasury.  The  electronic \nTreasury  system  is  now  running  in  a  pilot  exploration  mode  and  will  be  fully  functional  by  the \nend of 2009  \n  \n6. \nProcurement  Reforms.  In  line  with  the  2007  Country  Procurement  Assessment,  the \nGovernment  has  moved  to  enhance  transparency  and  efficiency  in  the  procurement  process. \nGeorgia  enacted  a  new  State  Procurement  Law  which  established  the  State  Procurement \nAgency  (SPA),  and  instituted  government-wide  processes  for  transparent  procurement.  For \ninstance, \ninformation  about  procurement  practices.  Later \namendments  to  the  procurement  law  included  the  expansion  of  coverage  to  state  owned \nenterprises, streamline procedures, and adopt international practices of retroactive financing in \npublic  procurement.    The  improvement  in  the  procurement  framework  has  resulted  in  the \nfivefold increase in public tenders from 796 in 2005 to more than 3,500 in 2007.  \n  \n7. \nLocal  Government  Budgeting.  The  Government  has  also  reformed  local  government \nbudgeting  process  and  the  system  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers.  A  new  law  on  Local \nSelf  Government  Budgets  was  enacted  alongside  with  the  adoption  of  a  transparent \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  system  in  the  budget  preparation.  The  Government  has \nstarted to roll-out of a new integrated electronic system for monitoring municipal budgeting and \nfinancial  reporting.  Municipalities  prepared  their  2008  and  2009  budgets  under  the  new  law, \nrelated  budget  rules,  and  the  electronic  system.  As  such,  the  MOF  receives  from  all \nmunicipalities\u2019 monthly reports on the execution of their budgets. \n\nthe  SPA  website  discloses \n\n \nPublic  Finance  Management  Reform  Policy  Vision  2009\u20132013.  In  2009,  the \n8. \nGovernment issued it Reform Policy Vision for Public Finance Management for 2009-2013. The \ngoals  of  the  reforms  are  to:  (i)  maintain  fiscal  discipline  and  thereby  facilitate  macroeconomic \nstability  and  predictability  of  the  budget  system;  (ii)  promote  a  strategic  approach  by  ensuring \nthat resources are directed toward key policy and strategy priorities; (iii) deliver value for money \nby ensuring that resources are used effectively and efficiently; and (iv) ensure accountability in \nthe use of public resources.1 Table A6.1 shows the challenges discusses the challenges being \nfaced by Georgia in key areas in public financial management. Table A6.2 shows Government's \nPublic Finance Management Reform Action Plan for 2009. \n\n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Finance. 2009. Public Finance Management Reform Policy Vision 2009\u20132013. \n\n \n\n\fTable A6.1: Challenges in Public Financial Management for 2009-13 \n\nArea \nStrategic budgeting \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n  41\n\nChallenges \nThe Government policy framework is developed and \nrequires to be linked more effectively to the budget \nplanning process. The resource framework for budget \nplanning is now being determined within a medium-term \nmacro-fiscal framework, but weaknesses in forecasting \nmethodologies and capacities still need to be addressed. \nProcesses for strategic planning across government are \nstill evolving and the required skills, experience and \ntechniques need to be developed further. Achieving \ncloser integration between planning and policy \nmanagement presents organizational and management \nchallenges across government and within the ministries. \nResource ceilings that allow ministries to prioritize their \nbudget plans against a realistic estimate of future \nfinancing were introduced in 2004/05 and represent a \nkey reform. However, the analytical basis and \njustification for these resource ceilings should be \nstrengthened. The BDD is being developed so that it sets \nout with greater clarity the government\u2019s medium-term \nfiscal and public expenditure strategies and plans. \nHowever, the quality of the BDD analysis requires further \nimprovement and should be extended to include realistic \nresource ceilings for subsequent detailed budget \nplanning. The BDD should also be disseminated more \nwidely. \nDespite recent progress, the links between government \npolicies and strategies and budget preparation need to \ndevelop further. The medium-term action plans have still \nto be fully reflected in budget allocations. Automated \nsystems to formulate, analyze, produce, and monitor the \nbudget are either non-existent or deficient thereby \ndecreasing the efficiency of budget staff. Basic budgeting \npractices across the government are still at a reform \nstage: (i) budget planning processes in central and \nespecially local governments (line ministries and local \nbodies) are fragile and require improvement and \nmodernization; (ii) organizational and capacity \nweaknesses in the MoF and line ministries beginning to \nbe addressed and require further facilitation. \nParliamentary discussion of the Budget continues to be \nfocused on detail rather than strategic priorities and \nneeds modernization to increase the accountability of the \nline ministries and connectivity with the Government and \nsectoral strategies. \nThe processing of financial transactions is being \nimproved with the establishment of the TSA and most \nrevenues and expenditures flow through a single \nprocess. E-treasury systems are being introduced, but \nrequire further development in coverage and content to \nallow the budget organizations to exchange payment \ndocumentation with the Treasury electronically. There \nare still weaknesses in budget/cash management, which \nrequires additional attention in order to improve the \nbudget execution planning by the ministries as well as \ncash allocation planning by the MoF. Overall treasury \nexecution system needs modernization in order to meet \nrequested standards. \n \n\nBudget preparation \n\nResource management \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n42 \n \n\nArea \n\nInternal control \n\nAccounting and reporting \n\nChallenges \nMobilization of financial resources has been considerably \ntransformed with: (i) significant progress made in \nstrengthening revenue administration, although further \nmeasures are required to improve the interface with \ntaxpayers, and strengthen revenue administration \ncapacities; (ii) substantial progress in reforming tax and \ncustoms legislation, policy and administration although \nthese reforms require further consolidation; and the \nstrengthening of internal and external debt management. \n \nPersonnel management processes need further attention \nin order to improve wage bill planning and management. \nDifferent internal control instruments are in place and \nhave been under development over the past years. For \ninstance budget expenses commitment control \nmechanism has been introduced since 2003 and has \ncontributed to better management of public spending. \nHowever, many internal control instruments are poorly \nformulated with limited compliance and oversight. There \nis no legislative basis for internal audit. Although some \nfinancial inspection and supervision functions are \noperational, there is insufficient oversight of resource \nmanagement procedures within ministries. \nTreasury reforms to date have focused on improving the \nrecording of transactions and were successful, however \naccounting and reporting systems and practices are not \nstandardized. Budget classification is done with GFS \nManual 2001 is used for cash transactions, while the \naccounting instructions give a different type of chart of \naccounts for accrual accounting. Accounts, particularly \nwith respect to local governments, LEPLs, other public \nentities are not consolidated and comprehensive. While \ncentral government reporting is sound improvements are \nrequired for consolidated financial reporting. Reporting \nbetween key players tends to be paper-based. This \ncontributes to delays in reporting and makes analysis by \nrecipients more difficult. There remain weaknesses in \naccounting capacities throughout Government with \nparticular challenges to be faced in establishing \naccounting and reporting practices for semi(cid:31)autonomous \nbodies, LEPLs, state owned enterprises, etc. \n\nNote: These are excerpts from the Public Finance Management Reform Policy Vision 2009\u20132013. \nBDD = budget directions document, GFS = government financial statistics, LEPL = legal entity of the public law, MoF \n= Ministry of Finance, TSA = treasury singleaccount. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. 2009.

The  JNA  was  specifically  tasked  to  estimate  the  financial  assistance \nrequired to address the direct losses and damage, and reestablish the conditions for a return to \nsustained growth in Georgia. The JNA was put together by a core team, led by the World Bank, \nand consisting of the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations (UN)\u2014together with \ntechnical sector teams comprising representatives of these institutions, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, \nand International Finance Corporation. The JNA draws on reports prepared by the EC of initial \nestimates of conflict-related damages and those prepared by the UN of conditions in Abkhazia \nand South Ossetia, Georgia. The teams examined (i) the macroeconomic and banking impact of \nthe  conflict,  (ii)  the  impact  on  the  social  sectors  and  on  directly  and  indirectly  affected \npopulations, and (iii) infrastructure and environment.  \n \nCountercyclical  Medium-term  Stabilization  Resource  Requirements. The JNA was \n2. \ntherefore  also \nresource \nrequirements for Georgia to avoid a protracted economic downturn in case the sudden-stop in \ncapital inflows  persisted  for  a  longer  period  of  time.  The  conflict  had  resulted  in  shocks  to  the \nkey pillars of Georgian economic growth and financial stability, and the effects of these shocks \nwere of uncertain duration in terms of the decline in foreign direct investment and international \nlending  to  Georgian  banks.  Thus,  the  JNA  identified  areas  for  new  physical  investments  for  a \nworst-case scenario in which a much longer period of decline in private resource inflows would \nneed  to  continuously  be  bridged  by  official  resource  inflows.  The  JNA  estimated  the  overall \nresource envelope required by this worst-case scenario from development partners to be up to \n$3.7  billion,  to  cover  a  period  of  3  years.  Actions  required  were  prioritized  and  presented  in \nthree sequential time frames: the first of 6 months (to March 2009) (immediate); a second of a \nfurther  12  months  (to  March  2010);  and  a  last  phase  of  a  further  12\u201318  months  (up  to \nSeptember  2011).  This  timeframe  of  3  years  was  therefore  the  estimated  transition  period \nwhere specific actions would be required to bring Georgia to its normal path of growth as long \nas the sudden-stop in capital inflows persisted. This scenario is now confirmed by the effects of \nthe international liquidity crisis and global economic slowdown on the Georgian economy.  \n \n\nto  quantify  countercyclical  medium-term  stabilization \n\ntasked \n\n \n\n\f46 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nCore \nInvestment \n(to Sep 2011) \n\nTotal \n\nTable A7.1: Georgia Joint Needs Assessment - Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \n\nKey Heads of Needs \nA.

Georgia:  Summary  of  Joint  Needs  Assessment  Findings. \nPrepared  in  partnership  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,  the  European  Commission,  the  European  Investment  Bank,  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation for the Donors\u2019 Conference of 22 October 2008 in Brussels. http://go.worldbank.org/H23WSCUJW0\n\n \n\n \n3. \nInternational  Financial  Crisis  Exacerbates  the  Macroeconomic  Adjustment. \nAlthough triggered initially by the August 2008 conflict, the steep drop in FDI inflows to Georgia \nfrom  August  2008  onwards  (from  $938  million  in  the  first  half  of  2008  to  $322  million  in  the \nsecond  half)  is  now  likely  to  continue  due  to  the  global  liquidity  crisis  and  the  effects  on  the \naggregate demand from the slowdown in both exports and inflow of remittances. The unwinding \nof the large macroeconomic imbalance built-in during the last 4-5 years is now in full swing, and \nonly  expansionary  fiscal  policies  can  smooth  the  social  consequences  of  this  macroeconomic \nadjustment.  Some  external  adjustment  is  in  itself  unavoidable  as  the  sharp  increase  in  the \nexternal  current  account  deficit  since  2003  reflected,  to  a  large  extent,  higher  imports  of \nintermediate  goods  related  to  ever-greater  FDI  inflows.  The  current  account  deficit  is  now \nexpected  to  decrease,  but  not  as  fast  as  it  could  happen,  as  import  demand  will  now  be \nincreasingly financed by official transfers. \n \n4. \nThe  Joint-Needs  Assessment  as  the  Crisis  Response  Framework.  In  sum,  as  a \nframework  to  address  the  effects  from  the  international  financial  crisis  in  the  economy  of \nGeorgia, the JNA remains fully relevant as joint response plan by the Government and the multi \ndevelopment partner group. The JNA identifies the need for intervention and donor assistance \nin three major areas: (i) Support for the rapid restoration of confidence. By providing budget \nsupport to back-stop countercyclical fiscal measures, donor partners can help the Government \nensure  that  critical  economic  and  social  needs  are  met;  (ii)  Support  for  social  needs.  The \nresettlement of internally displaced persons and the post-conflict needs of affected populations \nare  likely  to  require  significant  support;  (iii)  Support  for  critical  investments.  In  accordance \nwith the JNA\u2019s assessment, certain high-value and high-yield investments are key to maximize \nrecovery  prospects.  These  are  recognized  as  \u201ccore  investments\u201d  in  the  report.  Such  financing \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n  47\n\nwould also help the country enhance economic security by broadening access and connectivity \nin energy and transport spheres. \n   \n5. \nA  Donor  Conference  was  organized  in  Brussels,  Belgium,  on  22  October  2008,  where \nthe  Government  formally  sought  development  partner  assistance  along  the  above  lines. \nDevelopment partners have pledged a total of $4.5 billion in support over 2008-2010, of which \n$2 billion will be in the form of grants.
