The  project  will  complete  the  installation  of \nsmart meters in the Kathmandu Valley and the automation of existing grid substations throughout \nthe  country,  and  finance  the  modernization  of  other  distribution  and  transmission  systems  in \nvarious parts of the country, which were initiated through earlier approved projects of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNepal is a landlocked, mountainous country located between the large and fast-growing \neconomies of (the) People\u2019s Republic of China to the north and India to the east, west, and south. \nNepal\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaged  7.3%  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017\u2013\nFY2019. With deepening economic uncertainties because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic,  preliminary estimates show that GDP growth significantly declined to about 2.3% \nin  FY2020.2  The  need  to  stimulate  post-COVID-19  economic  recovery  by  developing  Nepal\u2019s \ninfrastructure has become more pertinent.  \n \n4. \nSector  challenges.  2020  has  so  far  been  a  momentous  year  for  Nepal\u2019s  electricity \ntransmission  and  distribution  subsector,  as  (i)  the  newly  formed  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC) issued its first independent and cost-reflective tariff determination for NEA, \nand (ii) NEA released its first comprehensive corporate development plan for the utility and the \nbroader subsector.3 These two events represent and reflect years of behind-the-scenes work by \nthe government, NEA, development partners, and stakeholders. The ERC has been assuming \nincreased responsibility as the independent regulatory body for electricity since mid-May 2019, \nand the  government  has  effectively removed  itself from  direct  electricity regulation,  particularly \nwith respect to tariff setting and consumer protection. The reform trajectory and sustainability of \nthe  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  subsector  have  significantly  improved,  providing \nmuch-needed  clarity  and  certainty  for  NEA,  investors  in  electricity  generation,  development \npartners, and electricity consumers. In addition, the complex task of devolution of responsibility \nfor electricity distribution to provincial authorities is underway.  \n \n5. \nDespite these improvements, there is still much to do in the country\u2019s energy sector before \nthe benefits of these reforms will improve the lives of all Nepalese. Nepal\u2019s per capita electricity \nconsumption of 198 kilowatt-hours per annum is just one-third of the average in South Asia and \none-tenth of the world average. While no significant gap between electricity demand and supply \nis evident, the low per capita consumption figure suggests that only basic electricity needs are \n\n \n\n1  ADB.  2017.

Kathmandu. \n\n\f2 \n\nbeing met and that the electricity intensity of the economy is still very low. The share of electricity \nin the energy mix of the country is less than 10%, and dependency on biomass and fossil fuels \nfor meeting cooking and transport needs is increasing. Only 1,320 megawatts (MW) of indigenous \nand clean hydropower have been realized to date out of economic potential that is estimated to \nexceed 40,000 MW. Although 78% of Nepal\u2019s population has access to grid-supplied electricity, \nthere  is  a  need  to  increase  the  capacity  and  reach  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks to meet current and future demand, improve reliability and quality of supply, and further \nreduce  losses.  Additionally,  network  bottlenecks  between  generation  hubs  and  load  centers, \nwhich  stand  as  an  impediment  to  the  expansion  of  large-scale  privately  owned  hydropower \ngeneration, need to be progressively eliminated. \n \n6. \nInvestment  requirements  for  improving  transmission  and  distribution  systems  and \ndeveloping hydropower projects to meet dry season (November until May) demand are beyond \nthe budgetary resources of the government. In this context, the government has been mobilizing \nprivate sector and commercial financing for run-of-river hydropower projects, including the 216 \nMW Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower Project, which is the largest private sector hydropower project \nunder  development  with  international  investment  participation,  including  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign \nfinancing.4  However,  the  government  has  recognized  that  the  investment  and  regulatory \nenvironment in the sector is still not yet sufficiently mature to attract private sector capital at the \nlevel  required,  particularly  in  the  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  subsector  and \nhydropower projects with large storage reservoir (\u201cstorage-type\u201d) to meet demand during the dry \nseason. \n \n7. \nGovernment priorities and reform initiatives. In its 2018 white paper, the government \narticulated its vision for the energy sector until 2028.5 The government also outlined a series of \nshort-, medium-, and long-term policy objectives in this white paper, and these objectives have \nprovided the policy framework for the development of NEA\u2019s integrated corporate development \nplan.  Priorities  encapsulated  in  the  white  paper  included  (i)  reaching  15,000  MW  of  installed \nhydropower  capacity  (including  storage-type  hydropower  like  the  Dudh  Koshi  Storage \nHydroelectric  Project),  (ii)  expanding  access  to  electricity  to  100%  of  the  population,  (iii) \nexpanding and modernizing electricity transmission and distribution systems with smart grids in \nmajor cities and industrial corridors to stimulate domestic electricity demand, and (iv) stimulating \nnew  electricity  demand  by  promoting  electric  vehicles  and  electric  cooking,  with  the  aim  of \nincreasing annual per capita consumption of electricity to 1,500 kilowatt-hours. Given the supply \ndeficits  during  the  dry  months  and  surpluses  during  the  rest  of  the  year,  the  white  paper  also \nemphasized power trading with neighboring countries through the establishment of a dedicated \npower  trading  entity  (Nepal  Power  Trading  Company  Limited)  and  related  legal  reforms. \nUnderpinning  the  white  paper  is  the  government\u2019s  plan  to  provide  sustainable  energy  for  all \n(Sustainable  Development  Goal  7)  and  the  achievement  of  Nepal\u2019s  Nationally  Determined \nContributions  for  the  United  Nations  Framework Convention  on  Climate Change  to reduce  the \ncountry\u2019s dependency on fossil fuel by 50% by 2050. \n \n8. \nNepal Electricity Authority. The executing agency of the project, NEA, was established \non 16 August 1985 under the Nepal Electricity Authority Act, 1984 as the state-owned national \nutility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  in  the  country. \nInvestment priorities and tariff setting have historically not been adequately rationalized, resulting \nin an unsustainable debt burden on NEA. Significant improvements have been made since 2017, \n\n \n\n4  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Nepal \nWater  and  Energy  Development  Company  Private  Limited for  the  Upper Trishuli-1  Hydropower  Project  in  Nepal. \nManila. \n\n5  Government of Nepal; Ministry of Energy, Water and Irrigation. 2018. White Paper on Energy, Water Resources and \n\nIrrigation Sector\u2019s Current Status and Roadmap for Future. Kathmandu. \n\n\f3 \n\nunderpinned  by  tariff  increases,  which  include  NEA\u2019s  commitment  to  reduce  losses  and  load \nshedding,  more  effective  and  decisive  management,  and  a  government-endorsed  financial \nrestructuring plan for NEA. These measures have helped NEA to provide continuous electricity \nsupply to its consumers and to deliver accounting profits. With the ERC becoming operational, a \nstructured  and  continuous  approach to tariff  setting  is  now  in  place.  However,  NEA\u2019s  ability  to \nprepare  comprehensive tariff  proposals,  duly  supported  by  verifiable  evidence  and recovery  of \nhistorical investments, remains a key challenge. \n \nNEA is the counterparty to all power purchase agreements, and the owner and operator \n9. \nof  Nepal\u2019s  electricity  networks.  Therefore,  improving  its  technical  and  commercial  viability  is  a \nprerequisite for attracting significant private investment to the country. The government and NEA \nhave  demonstrated  commitment  to  maintaining  reform  momentum  through  NEA\u2019s  Corporate \nDevelopment Plan, 2019/20\u20132023/24 (footnote 3). This ambitious inaugural plan is built around \nthree strategic themes: (i) promoting energy independence in Nepal; (ii) transforming NEA into a \ncapable,  modern,  and  smart  utility;  and  (iii)  improving  customer  care.  It  sets  out  a  number  of \noperational goals, including increasing total network capacity to 5,000 MW (from about 1,300 MW \nas  of  December  2019), connecting  2 million  new  customers,  having  one-third of  all  customers \npaying  their  bills  electronically,  and  doubling  efficiency  (by  halving  the  number  of  staff  per \ncustomer).  There  are  two  particularly  encouraging  factors  that  set  this  plan  apart  from  similar \ndocuments issued by NEA and the government in the past: (i) rather than it simply repeating high-\nlevel  policies  and  ambitions,  the  plan  includes  delivery  time  frames,  budgets,  financing \nrequirements; assigns responsibilities for implementation of each of the plan\u2019s components; and \narticulates a monitoring framework, including key performance indices; and (ii) the plan is entirely \nNEA\u2019s\u2014it was initiated, prepared, and published by NEA, and it is intended to be executed by \nNEA. The plan represents a major shift in the apparent ability and willingness of NEA to prepare \nfor  its  own  future  within  the  context  of  the  government\u2019s  policy  directives.  Out  of  combined \ninvestment requirement of about $2.4 billion for transmission and distribution, NEA estimates that \nit will require $1.8 billion to be debt-financed. This investment, along with NEA\u2019s ongoing efforts \nto  modernize  its  asset  register  and  revalue  its  generation  and  network  assets,  will  facilitate \ndevolution  of  NEA\u2019s  distribution  assets  to  provincial  authorities  and  promote  transparency. \nMoreover, NEA has adopted a corporate gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) strategy, \nand plans to institutionalize it with capacity building support from the project.6 \n \n10. \nADB assistance to the sector. ADB is a major development partner supporting Nepal\u2019s \nenergy  sector  in  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  subsectors  with  a  sovereign \nportfolio of about $560 million as of May 2020. ADB has also played active role in facilitating the \nmajor policy and institutional reforms of NEA as elaborated above, through policy level dialogues \nin  close  coordination  with  the  World  Bank  and  other  development  partners.  Of  the  total  ADB \ncommitment, contracts have been awarded for $473 million and $202 million has been disbursed. \nThis has helped Nepal end crippling load shedding and reduce technical losses. ADB and other \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  World  Bank,  have  provided  continued  support  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s power system reform efforts since 2010. The Power Transmission and Distribution \nEfficiency Enhancement Project approved by ADB for Nepal in 2017 focuses on construction of \nnew  grid  substations,  reinforcement  and  modernization  of  electricity  distribution  infrastructure \n\n \n\n  GESI is a concept that addresses unequal power relations between women and men, and between different social \ngroups. It focuses on the need for action to rebalance these power relations and ensure equal rights, opportunities, \nand respect for all individuals regardless of their social identity. NEA\u2019s GESI strategy and operational guideline were \nprepared and approved by NEA\u2019s board on 19 March 2020 with technical assistance provided by ADB under ADB. \n2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Nepal for the Power Transmission and Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project. \nManila. \n\n6\n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nwithin the Kathmandu Valley, and a smart metering rollout in parts of the Kathmandu Valley; its \nimplementation  progress  is  on  track  although  affected  by  impact  of  COVID-19,    as  of October \n2020.7  Also,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  is  supporting  the  Upper  Trishuli-1 \nHydropower  Project,  which  was  approved  in  April  2019.  ADB  approved  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Power Transmission and Distribution System Strengthening \nProject on 26 June 2020 to improve electricity supply in Kathmandu Valley and other areas.8  Its \napproval  was  delayed  due  to  COVID-19  from  its  original  target  of  early  2020.  The  proposed \nElectricity  Grid  Modernization  Project  is  the  second  project  for  approval  in  2020,  and  was \nprepared on a fast-track basis by NEA in line with the ambition of the Corporate Development \nPlan to expedite investment and reforms, and focusing on urgent priority investments. Nepal is \nexpecting about 500 MW additional capacity to be connected to the grid by 2021, and about 1,500 \nMW  by  2025.  Some  of  the  transmission  lines  need  to  be  urgently  built  to  avoid  NEA paying  a \npenalty  to  hydropower  plants  invested  in  by  the  private  sector  because  of  non-evacuation  of \npower on time. These are critical activities to maintain and expand transmission and distribution \nsystems, and help improve NEA\u2019s financial sustainability. Thus, NEA rapidly built up the project \nreadiness  (with  feasibility,  design  and  advance  procurement)  of  the  respective  components  to \npromote  timely  and  efficient  implementation.  Both  of  these  projects  are  part  of  the  critical \ninvestments  to  accommodate  with  the  rapidly  growing  generation  capacity.  They  have  been \nprepared  following  a  phased  approach  based  on  the  readiness  of  subprojects.  The  proposed \nproject is also prepared as a part of the government\u2019s COVID-19 recovery initiatives to provide \nlocal employment and in consideration of the available concessional resource allocation for the \ncountry. \n \n11. \nAlignment  with  ADB  priorities.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Nepal, \n2020\u20132024  supports  the  government's  development  objective  of  accelerated  and  inclusive \neconomic growth.9 The project is fully aligned with the strategy, articulated in the CPS, to focus \non  energy  sector  reform  and  financial  sustainability,  and  to  strengthen  transmission  and \ndistribution systems to support regional cooperation and integration. The project is aligned with \nsix operational priorities under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 It will contribute to addressing remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequalities  by  strengthening  the  distribution  network.  The  project  will \ncontribute  to  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  by  targeting  women  and  disadvantaged \ngroups  for  awareness  raising  on  efficient  and  safe  use  of  electricity  and  new  electricity \nconnections.  It  will  help  address  climate  change  by  upgrading  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems to (i) evacuate hydropower to load centers, (ii) reduce system losses, and (iii) improve \nthe urban environment in the Kathmandu Valley and towns in other areas. Similarly, the project \nwill help strengthen governance and institutional capacity, and promote regional cooperation and \nintegration  through  Nepal  Power  Trading  Company  Limited,  the  new  power  trading  company \nunder NEA. \n \n12. \nNational  emergency  resilience  and  post-pandemic  recovery.  The  need  for  the \nproposed  project  has  become  even  stronger  in  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.

Improvement of the transmission network will help reduce system losses and improve \nquality of electricity supply. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Electricity  distribution  system  in  project  areas  strengthened  and \nmodernized. This will include (i) construction of a centralized command and control center for \nelectricity distribution in Kathmandu with at least 30% female staff; (ii) installation of  smart meters \nfor 350,000 electricity customers in the Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) construction of a distribution \nsystem consisting of 30 km of 33 kV distribution lines in Morang district and about 4 automated \n33/11 kV substations totaling 32 MVA in various parts of the country (Borang, Keraun, Madichaur, \nand  Pantang).  About  134,000  households  outside  the  Kathmandu  Valley  will  have  better \nelectricity  supply  resulting  from  improved  distribution  network.  To  improve  demand-side \nefficiency,  the  project  will  increase  the  knowledge  and  awareness  of  about  2,000  electricity \nconsumers, including at least 30% women and 30% members of disadvantaged groups, in project \nareas on safe and efficient use of electricity.14 \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  to  implement  its  Corporate \nDevelopment  Plan  strengthened.  The  project  will  support  strengthening  NEA\u2019s  institutional \ncapacity starting with increasing understanding of at least 30 eligible NEA staff (including 30% \nwomen) on the first comprehensive development plan for NEA formulated in 2019. The project \nwill provide training to at least 30 NEA staff (including 30% women) on operation of automated \ngrid substations. It will support the implementation of key actions from NEA\u2019s GESI strategy and \noperational guidelines in its regional offices to complement corporate activities covered under the \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Power  Transmission  and  Distribution  System \nStrengthening Project (footnote 8). The project will also support sector reform by facilitating an \n\n \n\n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 The 88 km of 132 kV transmission lines comprise the following: Dandakhet\u2013Rahughat (25 km), Madichaur\u2013Gorahi \n\n(40 km), and Borang\u2013Lapang (23 km); the 25 km of 220 kV transmission line will be in Lapang\u2013Ratomate. \n\n13 The 220 kV substations will be in Lapang and Rahughat; and the 132 kV substations will be in Borang, Dandakhet, \n\nKeraun, Lapang, Madichaur, Pangtang, and Rahughat. \n\n14  Disadvantaged groups include the following: Dalit, Adivasi Janajati, Madhesi, Muslim, other backward class, people \nwith disability, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer, and people from remote geographical areas. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\noverall  improvement  in  NEA\u2019s  corporate  financial  reporting  through  supporting  full  compliance \nwith the Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS). Project implementation consultants under \nthis proposed project will help implement these activities. All of these procedures and guidelines, \nalong with an operations manual to be prepared, will be used to help operationalize NEA\u2019s Nepal \nPower Trading Company Limited as a separate entity. This is in line with the government plan \noutlined in the white paper to boost power trading with neighboring countries (para. 7).  \n \nC. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s support for development coordination and energy sector reforms is critical, and it \nis leveraging its own resources to help the government meet the substantial financial and skills \nresource requirement in the energy sector. ADB has a long history of partnership with NEA and \na record of providing financial and technical assistance aimed at supporting NEA\u2019s institutional \nand  financial  recovery  and  improved  governance.  ADB\u2019s  continued  involvement  signals  to \ninvestors and other development partners that the government is committed to reforms, and that \nNEA  is  on  a  path  to  sustainability.  The  project  will  build  on  the  experience  and  lessons  from \nprevious  ADB  projects,  particularly  on  advance  procurement  and  procurement  packaging, \nimplementation schedules, and stronger monitoring and supervision. ADB and the government \nhave  developed  criteria  to  determine  project  readiness  for  financing.  To  address  capacity \nconstraints,  dedicated  project  managers  will  be  engaged  and  tasked  with  developing  a  robust \nproject monitoring and internal control system, supported as required through capacity building \nactivities.  ADB  is  also  drawing  on  its  experience  in  promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration,  and  new  technologies  (e.g.,  more  efficient  high-temperature  low-sag  conductors, \nsubstation  automation,  smart  meters,  distribution  demand  and  control  centers)  to  help  Nepal \nbenefit  from  the  South  Asia  subregional  power  trading  market.  The  project  will  introduce \nappropriate construction methods, adoption of a bird-sensitive design (including bird diverters), \nand awareness raising activities while restringing transmission line conductors. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n \n19. \nproject administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n\nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $195 million (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA.

This  will  require  (i)  augmentation  of \ntransmission  substations,  (ii)  reconstruction  and  upgrading  of  medium-  and  low-voltage \ndistribution networks, and (iii) introduction of smart grid elements. Due diligence was undertaken \nto confirm that the cost estimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar \nrecent  ADB  projects  in  India  and  Nepal.  The  proposed  transmission  and  distribution  facilities \nfollow  planning  and  design  practices  already  being  implemented  by  NEA  in  other  projects. \nAdditional  scrutiny  will  be  imposed  to  ensure  that  construction  standards  are  high  and  reflect \ninternational best practice in works supervision. Overall, the proposed works follow international \ngood practice and are considered technically acceptable. The project design also incorporates \nclimate  change-related  aspects  and  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  34,716  tons  of  carbon \ndioxide per year by reducing losses and providing new connections with clean energy. The project \nis categorized medium risk in the climate change assessment (footnote 16). \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability. The project was analyzed for economic viability in accordance with \n26. \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  economic  analysis.17  A  with-project  and  without-project  framework  was \nadopted, and subprojects were broadly grouped into transmission capacity (new and upgraded \nsubstations and lines) and grid automation (substation automation, distribution control center, and \nsmart metering) categories for the purpose of economic analysis. The economic internal rate of \nreturn of the overall project is 14.8%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project\u2019s expected \neconomic performance is robust under a range of downside scenarios. \n \nFinancial viability. Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with \n27. \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  financial  management  and  analysis  of  projects.18  All  financial  costs  and \nbenefits were expressed in constant 2020 prices.

It posted an annual loss of NRs9 billion during FY2016 and its accumulated losses \nwere NRs35 billion by the end of FY2016. However, a strong commitment to improve performance \nand a government-backed financial restructuring plan allowed NEA to post a net profit of NRs1.5 \nbillion in FY2017 (its first profit since FY2007), with profit increasing to NRs2.9 billion in FY2018 \nand  NRs9.8  billion  in  FY2019.  With  the  commissioning  of  several  power  plants  and  the \nestablishment  of  the  ERC  in  2017,  the  short-  to  medium-term  financial  outlook  for  NEA  is \nincreasingly  favorable.  The  ERC  issued  its  first  1-year  tariff  order  for  NEA  in  June  2020  with \nreduction in tariff for poor domestic consumers, using the annual revenue requirement approach \nand  based  on  its  analysis  of  NEA\u2019s  actual  financial  performance  in  FY2018  and  FY2019  and \nforecast  financial  performance  for  FY2020.  This  approach,  which  allows  NEA  to  recover  its \neconomically efficient costs and to earn a reasonable return on equity, provides much-needed \ncertainty with respect to tariff trajectory and to NEA\u2019s ability to fund its operations, investments, \nand debt servicing. However, in its inaugural tariff determination order, the ERC disallowed certain \ncosts  and  return  on  equity  claimed  by  NEA,  on  account  of  insufficient  information.  NEA  has \nengaged an international consulting firm to assist in the preparation of tariff petitions, and planned \nimprovements  in  financial  reporting  are  also  likely  to  address  the  issue  in  future  tariff \ndeterminations in the future. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nFinancial management. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk of NEA \nis substantial primarily because of (i) lack of physical verification of assets and inventories, (ii) \npersistent  qualified  audit  opinions,  (iii)  partial  compliance  with  the  NFRS,  (iv)  delays  in  the \nimplementation  of \nfinancial \nresource  planning \nmanagement  information  systems,  and  (v)  weak  internal  controls.  NEA,  with  the  support  of \ngovernment  and  development  partners,  has  been  undertaking  several  reform  measures  to \naddress these weaknesses. Some of the key mitigation measures include (i) deployment of ERP \n(price  negotiations  with  a  technically  qualified  bidder  are  in  progress);  (ii)  completion  of  fixed \nassets  verifications  and  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  fixed  assets  register  (an  international \naccounting firm has already been hired); (iii) comprehensive updating and implementation of an \naccounting manual  to  comply  with the  NFRS;  (iv)  improvements  in  internal  audit  effectiveness \nthrough the introduction of a risk-based internal audit approach; (v) automated reconciliations of \ninterunit balances; and (vi) implementation of a risk management policy. NEA has been largely in \ncompliance  with  financial  covenants  in  the  loan  agreement  for  the  Power  Transmission  and \nDistribution  Efficiency  Enhancement  Project  (footnote  7)  except  debt  service  coverage  ratio, \nwhich  was  marginally  not  met  in  FY2019.  Major  reforms  in  NEA\u2019s  financial  management \ncapabilities are envisioned in NEA\u2019s Corporate Development Plan (footnote 3), including assets \nverifications, segment reporting, full NFRS compliance, ERP installation, staff trainings on ERP, \nimprovements  in  information  technology  policies  and  standards,  staff  capacity  building,  and \ndevelopment of automated billing and payment system infrastructure which will also be  supported \nthrough ADB\u2019s ongoing TA (footnote 8).

A procurement capacity assessment of NEA was conducted as part of due \n30. \ndiligence. NEA has sufficient capacity and experience in local and foreign procurement, including \nADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  procedures,  through  domestic  projects  and  external  assistance  from \ndevelopment partners. Through strategic procurement planning, NEA will be able to achieve value \nfor money by (i) strategic contract packaging, where some small packages are consolidated into \none bigger package with multiple lots to attract more competition, and (ii) application of lowest \nevaluated cost as one of the selection criteria. \n \nImpact of coronavirus disease pandemic on project implementation. The impact of \n31. \nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the project has been reviewed by ADB and NEA. Since the project \nhas an implementation period of 5 years with physical work not expected to commence at least \nuntil October 2021, COVID-19 is not expected to cause any significant delays or cost increases. \nNEA\u2019s  PMD  continues  to  work  effectively  and  efficiently  within  the  constraints  imposed  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s  response  to  the  pandemic.  However,  given  the  evolving  trend  and  severity  of \nCOVID-19, its potential impact will be regularly reviewed and mitigated by PMD and ADB. \n \nAnticorruption.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.20  No  significant  integrity  risks \n32. \nwere identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements  and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE. \n \n33. \nNepal\u2019s  per  capita  GDP  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  and  was  about  $1,034.8  in \nFY2019.  About  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas  where  poverty  is  more \nprevalent  and  severe.  The  government,  in  pursuit  of  Sustainable  Development  Goal  1  (end \npoverty  in  all  its  forms  everywhere),  aims  to  further  reduce  poverty  significantly  by  the  end  of \n2030. However, limited access to modern energy resources and inefficient grid connectivity have \nbeen hindering development. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionate impacts on the poor, \ninformal sector workers, migrant workers, households that depend on remittances, and women. \nWith  the  economic  disruption  caused  by  the  pandemic,  vulnerable  individuals,  including  those \nwho  are  just  above  the  poverty  line,  are  likely  to  be  pushed  below  the  poverty  line.  Nepal\u2019s \nestimated poverty headcount ratios of 3.9% at $1.90 a day, 27.6% at $3.20 a day, and 65.1% at \n$5.50 a day for FY2020 are projected to increase in FY2021 to 4.8% at $1.90 a day, 30.5% at \n$3.20 a day, and 68.1% at $5.50 a day.21 The project aims to strengthen the distribution capacity, \nimprove the reliability  and  quality  of  electricity,  and  help  reduce technical  losses  in  the  project \nareas. The project will create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during the \nconstruction phase, and in the medium- to long-term by promoting energy-based enterprises in \npoor  communities.  Moreover,  using  cleaner  energy  will  improve  urban  and  rural  air  quality, \npeople\u2019s health, living conditions, and overall quality of life. \n \n34. \nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  will  support  (i) \ninstitutionalizing  GESI  based  on  NEA\u2019s  GESI  strategy  and  operational  guideline  approved  in \nMarch  2020  (footnote  6),  (ii)  training  women  staff  of  NEA  on  technical  subjects  as  well  as \nleadership  and  management  skills,  and  (iii)  increasing  knowledge  of  at  least  2,000  electricity \nconsumers (including women and disadvantaged groups) on safe and efficient use of electricity. \nThese goals will be realized through professional trainings for NEA\u2019s women staff in each training \nprogram related to grid substation automation, organizational development, and improved billing \n\n20  ADB. 2003.

The project includes a new 7.4 km transmission line crossing \nagricultural  land  within  Chure  Hill  Conservation  Area  (CHCA)  plus  restringing  of  existing \ntransmission lines in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Ramsar site) buffer zone, Parsa National \nPark,  CHCA,  and  the  Kathmandu  Valley  (Swayambhu)  World  Heritage  Site  which  are \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Project impacts can be mitigated through implementation of the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  included  in  the  initial  environmental  examination \nprepared  per  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  and  national  environment,  health,  and \nsafety  provisions,  which  will  apply  to  both  project  and  associated  facilities.23  Site-specific \nbiodiversity and heritage management plans will be cleared by ADB before works on transmission \nlines  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  forest  land  proceed.24  The  initial  environmental \nexamination was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 14 August 2020 and will be disclosed locally by \nNEA. Meaningful consultations were held and will continue during project implementation.25 NEA \nwill  establish  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  will  submit  monitoring  reports  semiannually \nthroughout project implementation. NEA has significant experience as an executing agency for \nADB projects and has some capacity to implement environment safeguards. Project supervision \nconsultants (PSC) will support NEA in supervision and monitoring. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The \n37. \nproject will affect an estimated 253 households, including 108 indigenous households. Of the total \nhouseholds,  140  will  be  severely  affected  and/or  are  vulnerable,  with  9  of  these  households \nseverely  affected  because  of  loss  of  more  than  10%  of  their  land,  including  2  indigenous \nhouseholds. Social surveys and meaningful consultations were undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  SPS  and  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  project\u2019s  social  impacts  were \nadequately assessed, and compensation will be paid commensurate with the replacement costs. \nBenefit sharing of electricity among the local communities, including affected indigenous peoples \nand  other  vulnerable  households,  in  combination  with  an  energy-based  livelihood  and  skill \ndevelopment  program,  will  mitigate  adverse  impacts  and  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  local \ncommunities  with  a  large  proportion  of  indigenous  households.  A  combined  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples plan (RIPP) has been prepared and was disclosed on the ADB website on 14 \nAugust 2020. A grievance redress mechanism will be established by NEA. Budgetary provisions \nare  in  place  to  compensate  affected  people  for  impacts  and  losses  in  a timely  manner.  NEA\u2019s \nPMD has previous experience with land acquisition. PSC will be engaged to assist the PMD in \n\n \n\n22 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n23 Construction impacts include tree clearance within forest land and pollution and health and safety risks. Operational \nrisks include bird electrocution and collision, health and safety of electricity infrastructure, and pollution at substations. \nBiodiversity impacts will be mitigated and offset through manual construction, reforestation, use of a bird-sensitive \ndesign, and awareness raising for no net loss of biodiversity in the long term. In protected areas, works will accord \nwith  management  plans  and  support  actions  to  promote  and  enhance  conservation  aims,  including  vulture \nconservation. Pangtang substation is associated with the construction of a new transmission line. This has similar \nimpacts to the new project transmission lines passing through forest lands but not protected areas. Since the project \ninvolves existing substations, environmental audits were conducted, and the EMP includes a corrective action plan. \nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific guidelines were also included in the EMP. \n\n24 Critical habitat is also supported by the project with mitigation for the Bengal florican and three species of vulture. \n25 The  consultations  included  public  meetings  (680  participants,  27%  female,  conducted  during  2018\u20132020)  and \n\nquestionnaires (67 participants, 13% female, conducted during 2020). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nimplementing  the  RIPP.
