The  proposed  additional  financing  will  (i)  deepen  the \nongoing reform agenda, (ii) scale up successful project interventions, and (iii) enable completion \nof scaled-up project activities under an extended period.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBangladesh  has  made  considerable  achievements  in  reducing  poverty  and  making \nprogress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed additional financing will \nhelp  support  the  momentum  of  PEDP3\u2019s  good  performance  toward  achieving  MDGs  2  and  3 \nwhere  all  children,  boys  and  girls  alike,  can  complete  a  full  course  of  primary  schooling. 4 \nPEDP3\u2019s  approach  is  recognized  globally  as  a  successful  model  in  enhancing  government \nleadership  and  ownership  along  with  harmonized  support  from  development  partners.  All \nstakeholders, including the government and development partners, are committed to deepening \nthe ongoing reforms articulated in the National Education Policy.5 \n \nPEDP3  supports  four  key  reforms  of  the  National  Education  Policy:  (i)  establishing  an \n4. \nintegrated  school  system  under  a  framework  that  unifies  public,  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO),  and  private  providers;  (ii)  improving  quality  through  reduced  class  size,  improved \nteaching  practices,  and  a  focus  on  information  and  communication  technology  literacy; \n(iii) decentralizing  primary  education  administration  and  management;  and  (iv)  engaging  in \npartnerships with NGOs and the private sector.  \n \n5. \nPEDP3 is  supporting  one of  the  largest  primary  school  systems  in the  world,  with over \n19.5  million  children  enrolled  in  106,000  primary  schools.  It  is  making  progress  in  improving \naccess and retention in primary education. The net enrolment rate rose from 94.8% in 2010 to \n97.3% in 2013 and the completion rate increased from 60.2% to 78.6% over the same period. \nThe  following  reforms  to  support  quality  education  have  been  successfully  implemented: \n(i) introduction of the diploma in primary education, and pilot testing and scaling up of innovative \nteaching\u2013learning  methods  under  the  \u201cEach  Child  Learns\u201d  program,  are  leading  to  improved \nteaching practice; (ii) a streamlined recruitment process has increased the number of qualified \n                                                \n1   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   ADB.  2011.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Primary Education Development Project. Manila (Loan 2761-BAN).  \n3   The  eight  partners  are  the  European  Union,  the  Government  of  Australia,  the  Government  of  Canada,  the \nGovernment of Japan, the Government of Sweden, the Government of the United Kingdom, the World Bank, and \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). \n\n4   MDGs 2 and 3 refer to achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality, respectively. \n5   Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Education. 2010. National Education Policy. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand  female  teachers;  and  (iii)  the  Grade  5  Primary  Education  Completion  Examination  is \nbecoming competency-based. \n \n6. \n2014 confirmed that the innovative approaches of PEDP3 are yielding good progress:6  \n\nThe  joint  midterm  review  (MTR)  of  PEDP3  conducted  from  June  2013  to  September \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA greater focus on results, with the use of the disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) \nincentive mechanism, where 24 of 27 DLIs have been achieved at the closing of \nthe MTR, has shifted the nature of policy dialogue to focus on outputs, outcomes, \nand policy implementation, and to engage multiple and diverse stakeholders.7  \nUse  of  the  treasury  system  and  electronic  procurement  has  strengthened  the \ngovernance and accountability of these systems.  \nHarmonization  among  development  partners  has  been  at  an  exemplary  level, \nwith well-coordinated communication and review mechanisms, and joint decision \nmaking by all partners, showing the strength of the sector-wide approach. \n\n \n7. \nDespite  this  progress,  improvement  of  learning  outcomes  remains  a  major  challenge. \nNational  student  assessments  conducted  in  2011  and  2013  show  low  learning  achievements, \nespecially  in  Grade  5,  with  25%  of  assessed  students  mastering  Grade  5  competencies  in \nBengali (Bangla). In Grade 3, results are more encouraging, with 67% in 2011 and 74% in 2013 \nmastering Grade 3 competencies in Bengali (Bangla). Learning achievements are lower among \ndisadvantaged groups. Differences between schools and between rich and poor children are still \nhigh. The introduction of 1 year of publicly funded pre-primary education (PPE) in government \nprimary  schools,  nationalization  of  35,000  registered  nongovernment  primary  schools,  and \ncreation of an additional 26,000 teacher positions for the neediest schools are expected to help \nminimize the differences between schools and support disadvantaged children. The timeliness, \nquality,  and  coverage  of  the  annual  school  census  (the  core  monitoring  instrument  for \nmeasuring progress on all schools and students) have significantly improved. However, further \nmeasures are needed to improve usage of the census information to analyze, understand, and \naddress disparities in student learning outcomes and retention. \n \n8. \nImplementation progress and results are satisfactory, all safeguards requirements have \nbeen complied with, risks have been adequately managed, and the project was rated \u2018on track\u2019 \nsince October 2013. PEDP3 meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing.8 \n \n9. \nADB\u2019s  original  financing  was  planned  for  the  first  3  years  of  the  program,  with  the \nagreement that additional financing would be made available if implementation was satisfactory. \nGiven  the  positive  outcome  of  the  MTR  and  the  government\u2019s  strong  interest  in  deepening \nquality reforms with additional financing from several development partners, a joint decision was \nmade  by  all  partners  to  support  extension  of  PEDP3  to  maintain  the  momentum  of  progress. \nThe proposed additional financing is expected to improve key performance indicators relating to \n                                                \n6   Midterm  Review  Process  and  Lessons  Learned  at  Midterm  Review  Stage  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n7  PEDP3\u2019s financing from ADB and other development partners depends partly on the government achieving a set of \nnine annual DLIs from a common results framework (para. 11) deemed essential to meet the program\u2019s outcome. \nThe  proposed  additional  financing  will  follow  the  same  approach  as  in  the  original  project  using  DLIs  as  an \ninnovative feature. \n\n8   ADB\u2019s  additional  financing  eligibility  criteria  are  met,  as:  (i)  the  project  remains technically  feasible,  economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) the project is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) the additional financing \nis consistent with the current country partnership strategy; and (iv) the additional financing remains consistent with \nthe  original  project\u2019s  development  objectives  (ADB.  2011.  Additional  Financing.  Operations  Manual.  OM  H5. \nManila). See also Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nstudent  achievements,  access,  and  efficiency,  particularly  for  disadvantaged  groups.  The \nadditional  financing  will  cover  increased  cost  of  construction,  cost  for  overall  salary  increase, \nand  additional  cost  for  the  1-year  extension;  and  enable  scaling  up  of  successful  project \ninterventions,  including  appointing  additional  teachers  and  improved  teacher  education  to \nincrease impact and development effectiveness.9 \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of PEDP3 is quality education for all Bangladeshi children. The outcome of \n10. \nPEDP3 is an efficient, inclusive, and equitable primary education system delivering effective and \nrelevant  child-friendly  learning  to  all  Bangladesh\u2019s  children  from  pre-primary  through  Grade  5. \nThe project\u2019s expected impact and outcome remain consistent with the impact and outcome of \nPEDP3.  As  the  original  targets  for  two  outcome  indicators\u2014net  primary  enrolment  rate  and \nyears inputs per graduate\u2014were achieved at MTR, higher targets have been set.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nPEDP3 has a common results framework that is subdivided into four broad results areas. \nThese  four  interrelated  broad  results  areas  or  outputs  will  remain  the  same:  (i)  improved \nteaching and learning for all; (ii) reduced disparities and universal access and participation; (iii) \ndecentralized  and  effective  organization  of  the  primary  education  system;  and  (iv)  improved \nprogram  planning  and  management.  The  nine  annual  DLIs  are  represented  across  these  four \nbroad results areas. During the MTR, progress for each broad results area was reviewed, and \ninterventions and targets were agreed for the remaining program implementation period.10  \n \n12. \nThe  targets  and  indicators  in  the  DLI  matrix  for  the  nine  DLIs  for  years  4  and  5  are \ndefined in alignment with the broad indicators outlined in the original program document. For six \nof the nine DLIs, new targets and indicators for year 6 were added to ensure that incentivizing \nperformance  continues  through  the  end  of  the  project.  The  agreed  year  4  and  5  DLI  targets \nwere  revised,  reflecting  the  implementation  experience  from  the  first  3  years,  and  are  more \nrealistic than the original broadly defined targets.11  \n \nOutput 1: Improved teaching and learning for all. The project supports (i) initiatives to \n13. \nenhance  student  performance  of  all  the  children  under  the  \u201cEach  Child  Learns\u201d  program, \n(ii) school  and  classroom-based  assessment,  (iii)  initiatives  to  strengthen  curriculum  and \ntextbooks,  (iv)  timely  production  and  distribution  of  quality  textbooks  to  all  eligible  children, \n(v) gradual  introduction  of  information  and  communication  technology  in  education,  and \n(vi) activities  to  improve  teacher  education  and  development  to  ensure  the  learning  of  every \nchild.  The  reforms,  especially  the  \u201cEach  Child  Learns\u201d  program  and the  diploma  in  education, \nwill be completed, with more focus on systematic, continuous, and professional development of \nteachers and using information and communication technology in the classroom. The two DLIs \nfor  this  output  are  (i)  all  requested  textbooks  distributed  to  all  eligible  schools  on  time,  and \n(ii) the new diploma in education is provided in all 60 primary training institutes. \n\n \n\n                                                \n9   All interventions for the next 3 years of PEDP3 are reflected in the revised Program Matrix (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n10 Monitoring and Evaluation Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Disbursement-Linked Indicator Matrix and Disbursement Schedule (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). In the original DLI matrix, specific DLIs were defined for year 0 through year 3. For years 4 and 5, one \nadditional  broad  target  was  included,  with  the  understanding  that  specific  targets  for  years  4  and  5  would  be \nagreed on during MTR.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nschool-level \n\nOutput 2: Reduced disparities and universal access and participation. The project \n14. \nsupports  (i)  second  chance  and  alternative  education,  (ii)  1  year  PPE  to  children  at  age  five, \n(iii) mainstreaming  inclusive  education,  (iv)  preparing  disaster-prone  areas  for  continuing \nschooling during emergencies, (v) implementing a communication framework and an action plan \nfor  social  change  strategy,  (vi)  school  health  for  particularly  needy  children,  (vii)  enhanced \nschool  physical  environment  based  on  actual  physical  conditions,  and  (viii)  needs-based \ninfrastructure  and  furniture.  A  more  targeted  approach  to  address  differences  that  still  exist \nbetween  schools  and  between  students  from  different  backgrounds  will  be  applied.  PPE  will \nfocus  more  on  the  neediest  children;  collaboration  with  civil  society  in  providing  PPE  will  be \nstrengthened; and the quality of PPE will receive more attention. The process to identify sites for \nneeds-based  infrastructure will  be  improved,  including  improved  water  and  sanitation facilities, \nand mechanisms to address hard-to-reach children will be strengthened and assessed. The two \nDLIs  for  this  output  are  (i) quality  of  PPE  improved  and  coverage  of  PPE  expanded,  and  (ii) \nneeds-based infrastructure implemented to achieve a pupil\u2013usable classroom ratio of 56:1. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Decentralized  and  effective  organization  of  the  primary  education \nsystem.  The  project  supports  (i)  strengthening  of  field  level  offices,  (ii)  decentralization  of \nschool  management  and  governance, \nleadership  development, \n(iv) organizational review and strengthening of field offices by creating and filling new positions \nand institutionalizing a career path, (v) improvement in the quality and reliability of the Grade 5 \nterminal  examination,  (vi)  maintaining  efficient  recruitment  and  deployment  of  teachers, \n(vii) strengthening of the annual school census, and (viii) strengthening and institutionalizing the \nnational student assessment. To strengthen district and subdistrict-level supervision and school \nlevel  leadership  and  community  support,  decentralized  levels  will  be  given  more  flexibility  in \nallocating funds. An additional 26,000 teacher positions have been created and these teachers \nwill  be  placed  in  the  neediest  schools.  The  output  has  four  DLIs:  (i)  school  management \ncommittees and district education offices implement decentralized education plans, (ii) Grade 5 \nterminal examination is competency-based and its administration is enhanced, (iii) new teachers \nare recruited based on needs to meet the pupil\u2013teacher ratio of 40:1 and using the existing fair \nand  transparent  recruitment  system,  and  (iv)  the  annual  school  census  covers  all  types  of \nschools and improves accuracy and timeliness. \n \nOutput 4: Improved program planning and management. The project supports (i) the \n16. \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) and Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) \nin managing PEDP3, (ii) implementation of the PEDP3 procurement and financial management \n(PFM) action plan, (iii) ensuring adequate sector financing to meet the requirements of PEDP3 \nin  line  with  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework,  (iv)  strengthening  monitoring  functions, \n(v) strengthening human resource development, and (vi) promoting public\u2013private partnership to \nengage  relevant  NGOs  and  the  private  sector.  Strengthening  of  PFM  will  continue,  and  more \nfocus  on  systematic  human  resource  development  and  improved  usage  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships is planned. The DLI for this output is the primary education budget aligned with the \nprogram framework, consistent with the medium-term budgetary framework. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  revised  cost  of  PEDP3  is  estimated  at  $9.808  billion  (Table  1).  The  original \nestimated  cost  was  $8.337  billion  using  the  2011  exchange  rate,  which  is  equivalent  to \n$7.476 billion using the 2015 exchange rate. The increase in total investment is $2.332 billion. \nDuring the MTR, the program costing was revised based on the required investments to achieve \nthe targets agreed at MTR. Majority of the increase in allocation is in  the government revenue \nbudget,  caused  by  (i)  an  increase  in  pay  scale;  (ii)  nationalization  of  35,000  registered \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nnongovernment primary schools; (iii) additional 26,000 teacher posts; (iv) 1-year extension; and \n(v) reallocation of cost categories, including textbooks, from development costs to revenue costs. \nAll activities funded by the government revenue budget are essential to implement the reforms \nplanned  under  PEDP3.  Allocation  in  the  development  budget  did  not  increase  because  of  the \n(i) reallocation  of  cost  categories,  (ii)  rationalization  of  the  original  costing  based  on \nimplementation  experience,  and  (iii)  activities  that  were  originally  planned  to  be  integrated  in \nPEDP3  in  the  later  years  remaining  outside  PEDP3  in  discrete  projects.  These  projects \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  overall  sector  targets.  However,  as  these  projects  have  separate \nimplementation arrangements and financing agreements, they are not funded by PEDP3.12 \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nA.

The \nIslamic  Development  Bank  and  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  support  construction  projects \nunder a separate agreement. The World Bank and the European Union support nonformal education projects that \nstarted before PEDP3 and have separate agreements that prescribe engagement of NGOs in implementation.

The MOPME is the executing agency and the DPE is the key implementing \nagency. The MOPME will continue to lead overall coordination of the PEDP3 and the DPE will \nimplement,  supervise,  and  monitor  PEDP3.  For \nformulate  guidelines  and  plans;  and \nimplementation of specific parts of PEDP3, other agencies at the national level will continue to \nbe responsible. Detailed project management arrangements, as agreed with the government in \nthe revised program document, are set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \n21. \nProcurement  arrangements.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  continue  to  be  used  to \nfinance goods, works, and related services procured using national competitive bidding.14 Such \nprocurement follows the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006, and Public Procurement \nRules,  2008,  with  modifications  to  and/or  clarifications  on  the  procedures  agreed  between  the \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  as  set  out  in  the  PAM,  procurement  plan, \n\n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Since  all  contracts  are  jointly  cofinanced  by  other  development  partners,  universal  procurement  will  apply  (ADB. \n2013.  Blanket  Waiver  of  Member  Country  Procurement  Eligibility  Restrictions  in  Cases  of  Cofinancing  for \nOperations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nand  the  joint  financing  arrangement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Aside  from  ADB,  other \ndevelopment partners jointly finance goods, works, and related services procured using national \ncompetitive  bidding.  Based  on  the  performance  in  the  first  years  of  the  program,  specific \ncapacity  development  actions  have  been  agreed  during  MTR,  as  reflected  in  the  PFM  action \nplan, to continue mitigating risks and improving performance. After successfully pilot testing e-\nprocurement  for  works  contracts  under  PEDP3,  PEDP3  will  support  the  Local  Government \nEngineering  Department  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health  Engineering  to  expand \ne-procurement.  ADB  will  not  finance  any  goods  and  works  that  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  as  this  will  follow  World  Bank  guidelines.  All  consulting \nservices will be engaged using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The World Bank will not finance consulting services.  \n \n22. \nDisbursement conditions and arrangements. The existing arrangement will continue. \nFunds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  the  government\u2019s  consolidated  funds  based  on  withdrawal \napplications  submitted  by  the  DPE.  The  statement  of  expenditure  format  is  based  on \nsemiannual  interim  unaudited  financial  reports,  and  is  used  for  harmonized  financial  reporting \nand reimbursement. The interim unaudited financial reports reflect eligible expenditures. \n \n23. \nADB  will  continue  to  reimburse  the  government  every  6  months  in  accordance  with \narrangements  for  the  original  loan:  (i)  50%  on  achievement  of  annual  DLIs  that  will  be  priced \nequally, submission of agreed reports, and receipt of statement of expenditure; and (ii) 50% on \nreceipt  of  statement  of  expenditure.  Disbursement  schedules  for  the  ongoing  loan  and  the \nadditional financing are harmonized to maintain this arrangement.15 \n \n24. \nAll implementation arrangements, summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nupdated  PAM,  will  remain  the  same.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  annually  approve  the \nprocurement plan for national competitive bidding\u2014ADB for consulting services and  the World \nBank for international competitive bidding. An 18-month procurement plan has been included in \nthe updated PAM, the program document, and the World Bank\u2019s additional financing documents. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2015\u2013June 2017  \n30 June 2017; Loan closing date 31 December 2017a \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agency  Directorate of Primary Education \n\nProgram steering committee  \nSecretary of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (chair) \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education \n\nInternational competitive bidding for works and goods will not be eligible for \nADB financing. \nNational competitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n(indefinite delivery contract and \nindividual consultant selection) \nThe loan will finance eligible expenditures pertaining to the period from \n1 January 2015 to the effective date, covering eligible expenditures up to 20% \nof the loan amount.  \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \n\n18,000 contracts \n830 person-months \n\n$1,125 million \n$9 million \n\n                                                \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAspects  \n\nArrangements \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.

The  economic  analysis  provides  the  rationale  for  additional \nfinancing  for  the  project,  and  assesses  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  additional \nfinancing.  The  project  investment  is  the  estimated  additional  cost  above  current  PEDP3 \nspending.  The  benefits  are  related  to  changes  in  quantity  and  quality,  and  a  reduction  in  the \ninternal  inefficiency  of  education  produced  over  the  period  as  a  result  of  the  PEDP3.  The \nbenefits  are  broadly  assumed  from  two  possible  sources:  (i)  an  increased  number  of  primary \nschool  completers  who  earn  higher  wages  (relative  to  non-completers),  and  (ii)  an  increased \nquality of education resulting in a higher wage premium for all primary school completers. Costs \nare associated with additional program costs from government and development partners as a \nresult  of  the  increased  number  of  primary  school  teachers  and  increased  salary  levels.  The \nadditional  financing  will  finance  a  1-year  extension  of  implementation  until  June  2017.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  associated  with this  net  present  value  is  18.8%  for  the  whole \nprogram,  which suggests that the  additional financing  under  PEDP3  is  an economically  sound \ninvestment. \n  \n26. \nFiscal  sustainability.  The  long-run  sustainability  of  the  additional  financing  lies  within \nthe  original  framework  of  PEDP3,  which  depends  on  two  factors:  (i)  adequate  budget  to  the \nMOPME  to  maintain  the  investment  plan,  and  (ii)  continuity  in  the  flow  of  improvements  in \nquality and efficiency. The estimated resource envelope and the current gross domestic product \ngrowth trend indicate that it will not be difficult for the Ministry of Finance to allocate the required \namount  for  PEDP3  (FY2015\u2013FY2017).  The  allocation  of  a  higher  share  of  budget  to  primary \neducation  by  the  government  is  ensured  since  (i)  the  government\u2019s  national  education  policy \nproposes  a  significant  increase  in  budget  allocation  to  the  education  sector;  and  (ii) \ndevelopment  partner  support  is  linked  to  both  results  and  assurances  that  sector  budget \nallocations are in line with the medium-term budgetary framework. Efficiency gains are expected \nto benefit Bangladesh\u2019s primary education sector as a result of the reforms being supported by \nPEDP3,  including  improved  financial  management,  electronic  procurement,  and  strengthened \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  which  also  keep  costs  down  while  improving  overall  education \noutcomes.  These  will  continue  reinforcing  the  long-term  fiscal  sustainability  of  Bangladesh\u2019s \nprimary education sector. \n \nB. \n \nFinancial due diligence work was carried out as part of the MTR and additional financing \n27. \nprocessing  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and \n\nGovernance  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nFinancial Due Diligence Methodology Note.16 This analysis confirmed that the chosen modality \nis sustainable. The overall fiduciary risk, although substantial, remains manageable as a result \nof the measures provided in the PFM action plan, supported by targeted technical assistance to \nimprove government capacity, and is regularly updated following quarterly and annual fiduciary \nreviews and post-procurement audits.17 Based on the MTR recommendation, and upon request \nfrom  the  Government  of  Bangladesh,  the  deadline  for  sharing  the  annual  audited  program \nfinancial statements has been extended to 9 months after completion of each fiscal year. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment, MOPME, and DPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nPositive effects of public investment in education and health, and NGOs\u2019 contribution in \neconomic  and  social  empowerment  activities,  have  contributed  to  significant  improvement  in \npoverty  reduction  in  the  1990s  and  2000s.  Enrolment  and  retention  are  improving,  but  the \nschool  age  children  not  enrolled  in  primary  education  (3%)  are  from  the  most  disadvantaged \nbackgrounds.  PEDP3  will  focus  on  implementation  of  the  harmonized  plans  to  ensure  these \nchildren come to and stay in school. This will support providing PPE to the most needy, supply \nof  free  textbooks,  tuition  waivers,  provision  of  second  chance  education,  inclusive  education, \nand quality improvements. MOPME will continue with the stipend and school feeding program. \n \n29. \nGender  and  development. Gender equity in primary school enrollment, retention, and \nin teacher recruitment in government primary schools has been achieved. However, efforts are \nneeded to include gender and equity perspectives in all regular activities in primary education. A \ngender  equity  framework  (gender  action  plan),  which  is  part  of  the  inclusive  education  action \nplan,  has  been  implanted  in  the  first  years  and  has  been  updated  for  the  remaining  period.18 \nThe  poverty,  social,  and  gender  due  diligence for  the  original  project  still  suffices,  and  gender \ncategorizations and gender action plan commitments continue. \n \nD. \n \nEnvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The project remains \n30. \nenvironment category B. The common harmonized environmental management framework was \nprepared at the start with the World Bank and reviewed, resulting in minor adjustments as part \nof  the  MTR  and  additional  financing  process.  Implementation  is  compliant  and  no  major \nchanges  were  made.  The  project  remains  category  B  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  safeguards.  The  common  harmonized  social  management  framework, \nwhich  includes  both  aspects,  was  prepared  at  the  start  with  the  World  Bank  and  reviewed \nthoroughly,  with  further  strengthening  in  gender  inclusiveness  and  the  monitoring  process  as \npart of the MTR and additional financing. No major changes were made and implementation is \ncompliant.  No  private  homesteads  will  be  acquired  nor  will  vulnerable  squatters  be  made \nhomeless. The two joint frameworks harmonize ADB and World Bank safeguards policies, and \nshow the exemplary development partner collaboration. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.  2005.

The  project  combines  institutional  strengthening,  decentralization,  and \nhuman resource development to increase the government\u2019s institutional and personnel capacity. \nThe  second  risk  relates  to  fiduciary  risks  associated  with  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  project  includes  a  strong  joint  fiduciary  review  mechanism  by  ADB  and  the \nWorld  Bank  in  close  consultation  with  other  development  partners,  supported  by  technical \nassistance provided by  different  development partners including ADB to support strengthening \nof  fiduciary  oversight.  Use  of  the  treasury  system  by  channeling  of  all  development  partner \nfunds through the government\u2019s treasury to finance PEDP3 eligible expenditures, including use \nof  the  integrated  budget  and  accounting  system  for  consolidated  reporting,  are  major \nachievements  in  financial  management.  The  joint  PFM  action  plan  is  in  place  to  improve  the \nfiduciary environment. The integrated benefits and impact of PEDP3 are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. The risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.19  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and the MOPME have assured ADB that implementation of the project \n32. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government  and the  MOPME  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n34. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  \nSDR87,533,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Third \nPrimary Education Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; with an interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n24 April 2015\n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK    \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators with \nBaselinesa \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n(Overall Project) \n \n\n \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n(Overall Project) \n\nImpact \n\n \n\nCurrent project  \n\nCurrent project   \n\nQuality education \nfor all Bangladeshi \nchildren \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nASPR \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nASPR \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumption \nGovernment is \ncommitted to \nimplement agreed \npolicies. \n \n \nRisks \nInadequate capacity \nand resources \nslowing the pace and \ncompleteness of \nreform. \n \nNEP is not \nimplemented at a \ndesired pace and \ndepth. \n\n \n\nAssumptions \nSchools are the main \nfocal points for \nimprovements and \nreceived targeted \nresources. \n \nRobust monitoring \nand evaluation \nmechanism used to \nsustain \nimprovements. \n \n \nRisk \nSchools are unable \n\nLevel of achievement in Grade 3 and 5 \nmean score in Bangla and mathematics in \n2016: 75% (3 Bangla), 35% (5 Bangla), 60% \n(3 mathematics), and 45% (5 mathematics) \nfor both sexes, boys, and girls.

Especially for those indicators, the DLIs are used. The original DLI \nmatrix  was  only  very  specific  for  the  year  0,  year  1,  year  2,  and  year  3  DLIs;  for  years  4  and  5,  one  broader \nindicator was defined with the understanding that this would be specified during midterm review. During the review, \nthis specification has taken place, and six DLIs for year 6 are added. The majority of the original output indicators \nwas taken from the broad-based year 4 and 5 DLIs, and are now specified based on implementation experience. \nAll of the targets are included in the government results framework with which ADB harmonizes.  \n\nb  In the design and monitoring framework approved in 2011, the activities and milestones were structured annually \nwith a focus on the overall review cycle to comply with ADB guidelines. These guidelines have been changed after \nthe start of the program, and activities and milestones now need to be presented by each output. This required a \nfull revision of the original milestones and activities.  Therefore, to inform about changes compared to the original \nloan only the remark \u201ccompleted\u201d is used, as the remarks \u201cchanged,\u201d \u201cunchanged,\u201d and \u201cadded\u201d have no value. \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=42122-016-3 \n \n\nLoan Agreement \n\nSector Assessment (Summary): Education \n\nProject Administration Manual  \n\nSummary of Project Performance  \n\nContribution to the ADB Results Framework  \n\nDevelopment Coordination  \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis  \n\nCountry Economic Indicators  \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n\nGender Action Plan  \n\nEnvironmental Management Framework  \n\nCombined Resettlement Framework and Small Ethnic Communities Planning \nFramework \n\n13. \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n\n \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nDisbursement-Linked Indicator Matrix and Disbursement Schedule  \n\nProgram Matrix  \n\n16.
