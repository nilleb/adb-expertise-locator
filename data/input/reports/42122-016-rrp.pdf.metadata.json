THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Third  Primary \nEducation Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing Third Primary Education \nDevelopment  Project  for  SDR202,212,000  ($320  million  equivalent)  on  5  July  2011.2 The \nGovernment of Bangladesh, ADB, and eight other development partners jointly finance the \ngovernment\u2019s  6-year  (FY2012\u2013FY2017)  Third  Primary  Education  Development  Program \n(PEDP3).3 The program focuses on improving student learning outcomes and completion rates, \nand reducing disparities across regions. The proposed additional financing will (i) deepen the \nongoing reform agenda, (ii) scale up successful project interventions, and (iii) enable completion \nof scaled-up project activities under an extended period.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh  has  made  considerable  achievements  in  reducing  poverty  and  making \nprogress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed additional financing will \nhelp support the momentum of PEDP3\u2019s good performance toward achieving MDGs 2 and 3 \nwhere all children, boys and girls alike, can complete a full course of primary schooling.4 \nPEDP3\u2019s approach is recognized globally as a successful model in enhancing government \nleadership  and  ownership  along  with  harmonized  support  from  development  partners.  All \nstakeholders, including the government and development partners, are committed to deepening \nthe ongoing reforms articulated in the National Education Policy.5 \n \n4.  PEDP3 supports four key reforms of the National Education Policy: (i) establishing an \nintegrated school system under a framework that unifies public, nongovernment organization \n(NGO),  and  private  providers;  (ii)  improving  quality  through  reduced  class  size,  improved \nteaching  practices,  and  a  focus  on  information  and  communication  technology  literacy; \n(iii) decentralizing  primary  education  administration  and  management;  and  (iv)  engaging  in \npartnerships with NGOs and the private sector.  \n \n5.  PEDP3 is supporting one of the largest primary school systems in the world, with over \n19.5 million children enrolled in 106,000 primary schools. It is making progress in improving \naccess and retention in primary education. The net enrolment rate rose from 94.8% in 2010 to \n97.3% in 2013 and the completion rate increased from 60.2% to 78.6% over the same period. \nThe  following  reforms  to  support  quality  education  have  been  successfully  implemented: \n(i) introduction of the diploma in primary education, and pilot testing and scaling up of innovative \nteaching\u2013learning methods under the \u201cEach Child Learns\u201d program, are leading to improved \nteaching practice; (ii) a streamlined recruitment process has increased the number of qualified \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Primary Education Development Project. Manila (Loan 2761-BAN).  \n3  The eight partners are the European Union, the Government of Australia, the Government of Canada, the \nGovernment of Japan, the Government of Sweden, the Government of the United Kingdom, the World Bank, and \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). \n4  MDGs 2 and 3 refer to achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality, respectively. \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Education. 2010. National Education Policy. Dhaka. \n ", "2   \nand  female  teachers;  and  (iii)  the  Grade  5  Primary  Education  Completion  Examination  is \nbecoming competency-based. \n \n6.  The joint midterm review (MTR) of PEDP3 conducted from June 2013 to September \n2014 confirmed that the innovative approaches of PEDP3 are yielding good progress:6  \n(i)  A greater focus on results, with the use of the disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) \nincentive mechanism, where 24 of 27 DLIs have been achieved at the closing of \nthe MTR, has shifted the nature of policy dialogue to focus on outputs, outcomes, \nand policy implementation, and to engage multiple and diverse stakeholders.7  \n(ii)  Use of the treasury system and electronic procurement has strengthened the \ngovernance and accountability of these systems.  \n(iii)  Harmonization among development partners has been at an exemplary level, \nwith well-coordinated communication and review mechanisms, and joint decision \nmaking by all partners, showing the strength of the sector-wide approach. \n \n7.  Despite this progress, improvement of learning outcomes remains a major challenge. \nNational student assessments conducted in 2011 and 2013 show low learning achievements, \nespecially in Grade 5, with 25% of assessed students mastering Grade 5 competencies in \nBengali (Bangla). In Grade 3, results are more encouraging, with 67% in 2011 and 74% in 2013 \nmastering Grade 3 competencies in Bengali (Bangla). Learning achievements are lower among \ndisadvantaged groups. Differences between schools and between rich and poor children are still \nhigh. The introduction of 1 year of publicly funded pre-primary education (PPE) in government \nprimary  schools,  nationalization  of  35,000  registered  nongovernment  primary  schools,  and \ncreation of an additional 26,000 teacher positions for the neediest schools are expected to help \nminimize the differences between schools and support disadvantaged children. The timeliness, \nquality,  and  coverage  of  the  annual  school  census  (the  core  monitoring  instrument  for \nmeasuring progress on all schools and students) have significantly improved. However, further \nmeasures are needed to improve usage of the census information to analyze, understand, and \naddress disparities in student learning outcomes and retention. \n \n8.  Implementation progress and results are satisfactory, all safeguards requirements have \nbeen complied with, risks have been adequately managed, and the project was rated \u2018on track\u2019 \nsince October 2013. PEDP3 meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing.8 \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s original financing was planned for the first 3 years of the program, with the \nagreement that additional financing would be made available if implementation was satisfactory. \nGiven the positive outcome of the MTR and the government\u2019s strong interest in deepening \nquality reforms with additional financing from several development partners, a joint decision was \nmade by all partners to support extension of PEDP3 to maintain the momentum of progress. \nThe proposed additional financing is expected to improve key performance indicators relating to \n                                                \n6  Midterm Review Process and Lessons Learned at Midterm Review Stage (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n7  PEDP3\u2019s financing from ADB and other development partners depends partly on the government achieving a set of \nnine annual DLIs from a common results framework (para. 11) deemed essential to meet the program\u2019s outcome. \nThe proposed additional financing will follow the same approach as in the original project using DLIs as an \ninnovative feature. \n8  ADB\u2019s additional financing eligibility criteria are met, as: (i) the project remains technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) the project is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) the additional financing \nis consistent with the current country partnership strategy; and (iv) the additional financing remains consistent with \nthe original project\u2019s development objectives (ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5. \nManila). See also Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "3 \nstudent  achievements,  access,  and  efficiency,  particularly  for  disadvantaged  groups.  The \nadditional financing will cover increased cost of construction, cost for overall salary increase, \nand  additional  cost  for  the  1-year  extension;  and  enable  scaling  up  of  successful  project \ninterventions,  including  appointing  additional  teachers  and  improved  teacher  education  to \nincrease impact and development effectiveness.9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of PEDP3 is quality education for all Bangladeshi children. The outcome of \nPEDP3 is an efficient, inclusive, and equitable primary education system delivering effective and \nrelevant child-friendly learning to all Bangladesh\u2019s children from pre-primary through Grade 5. \nThe project\u2019s expected impact and outcome remain consistent with the impact and outcome of \nPEDP3. As the original targets for two outcome indicators\u2014net primary enrolment rate and \nyears inputs per graduate\u2014were achieved at MTR, higher targets have been set.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  PEDP3 has a common results framework that is subdivided into four broad results areas. \nThese  four  interrelated  broad  results  areas  or  outputs  will  remain  the  same:  (i)  improved \nteaching and learning for all; (ii) reduced disparities and universal access and participation; (iii) \ndecentralized and effective organization of the primary education system; and (iv) improved \nprogram planning and management. The nine annual DLIs are represented across these four \nbroad results areas. During the MTR, progress for each broad results area was reviewed, and \ninterventions and targets were agreed for the remaining program implementation period.10  \n \n12.  The targets and indicators in the DLI matrix for the nine DLIs for years 4 and 5 are \ndefined in alignment with the broad indicators outlined in the original program document. For six \nof the nine DLIs, new targets and indicators for year 6 were added to ensure that incentivizing \nperformance continues through the end of the project. The agreed year 4 and 5 DLI targets \nwere revised, reflecting the implementation experience from the first 3 years, and are more \nrealistic than the original broadly defined targets.11  \n \n13.  Output 1: Improved teaching and learning for all. The project supports (i) initiatives to \nenhance  student  performance  of  all  the  children  under  the  \u201cEach  Child  Learns\u201d  program, \n(ii) school  and  classroom-based  assessment,  (iii)  initiatives  to  strengthen  curriculum  and \ntextbooks, (iv) timely production and distribution of quality textbooks to all eligible children, \n(v) gradual  introduction  of  information  and  communication  technology  in  education,  and \n(vi) activities to improve teacher education and development to ensure the learning of every \nchild. The reforms, especially the \u201cEach Child Learns\u201d program and the diploma in education, \nwill be completed, with more focus on systematic, continuous, and professional development of \nteachers and using information and communication technology in the classroom. The two DLIs \nfor this output are (i) all requested textbooks distributed to all eligible schools on time, and \n(ii) the new diploma in education is provided in all 60 primary training institutes. \n \n                                                \n9  All interventions for the next 3 years of PEDP3 are reflected in the revised Program Matrix (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n10 Monitoring and Evaluation Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Disbursement-Linked Indicator Matrix and Disbursement Schedule (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). In the original DLI matrix, specific DLIs were defined for year 0 through year 3. For years 4 and 5, one \nadditional broad target was included, with the understanding that specific targets for years 4 and 5 would be \nagreed on during MTR.  \n ", "4   \n14.  Output 2: Reduced disparities and universal access and participation. The project \nsupports (i) second chance and alternative education, (ii) 1 year PPE to children at age five, \n(iii) mainstreaming  inclusive  education,  (iv)  preparing  disaster-prone  areas  for  continuing \nschooling during emergencies, (v) implementing a communication framework and an action plan \nfor social change strategy, (vi) school health for particularly needy children, (vii) enhanced \nschool  physical  environment  based  on  actual  physical  conditions,  and  (viii)  needs-based \ninfrastructure and furniture. A more targeted approach to address differences that still exist \nbetween schools and between students from different backgrounds will be applied. PPE will \nfocus more on the neediest children; collaboration with civil society in providing PPE will be \nstrengthened; and the quality of PPE will receive more attention. The process to identify sites for \nneeds-based infrastructure will be improved, including improved water and sanitation facilities, \nand mechanisms to address hard-to-reach children will be strengthened and assessed. The two \nDLIs for this output are (i) quality of PPE improved and coverage of PPE expanded, and (ii) \nneeds-based infrastructure implemented to achieve a pupil\u2013usable classroom ratio of 56:1. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Decentralized  and  effective  organization  of  the  primary  education \nsystem. The project supports (i) strengthening of field level offices, (ii) decentralization of \nschool  management  and  governance,  (iii)  school-level  leadership  development, \n(iv) organizational review and strengthening of field offices by creating and filling new positions \nand institutionalizing a career path, (v) improvement in the quality and reliability of the Grade 5 \nterminal  examination,  (vi)  maintaining  efficient  recruitment  and  deployment  of  teachers, \n(vii) strengthening of the annual school census, and (viii) strengthening and institutionalizing the \nnational student assessment. To strengthen district and subdistrict-level supervision and school \nlevel leadership and community support, decentralized levels will be given more flexibility in \nallocating funds. An additional 26,000 teacher positions have been created and these teachers \nwill  be  placed  in  the  neediest  schools. The  output  has four  DLIs:  (i)  school management \ncommittees and district education offices implement decentralized education plans, (ii) Grade 5 \nterminal examination is competency-based and its administration is enhanced, (iii) new teachers \nare recruited based on needs to meet the pupil\u2013teacher ratio of 40:1 and using the existing fair \nand transparent recruitment system, and (iv) the annual school census covers all types of \nschools and improves accuracy and timeliness. \n \n16.  Output 4: Improved program planning and management. The project supports (i) the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) and Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) \nin managing PEDP3, (ii) implementation of the PEDP3 procurement and financial management \n(PFM) action plan, (iii) ensuring adequate sector financing to meet the requirements of PEDP3 \nin line with the medium-term budgetary framework, (iv) strengthening monitoring functions, \n(v) strengthening human resource development, and (vi) promoting public\u2013private partnership to \nengage relevant NGOs and the private sector. Strengthening of PFM will continue, and more \nfocus  on  systematic  human  resource  development  and  improved  usage  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships is planned. The DLI for this output is the primary education budget aligned with the \nprogram framework, consistent with the medium-term budgetary framework. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n17.  The  revised  cost  of  PEDP3  is  estimated  at  $9.808  billion  (Table  1).  The  original \nestimated  cost  was  $8.337  billion  using  the  2011  exchange  rate,  which  is  equivalent  to \n$7.476 billion using the 2015 exchange rate. The increase in total investment is $2.332 billion. \nDuring the MTR, the program costing was revised based on the required investments to achieve \nthe targets agreed at MTR. Majority of the increase in allocation is in the government revenue \nbudget,  caused  by  (i)  an  increase  in  pay  scale;  (ii)  nationalization  of  35,000  registered \n ", "5 \nnongovernment primary schools; (iii) additional 26,000 teacher posts; (iv) 1-year extension; and \n(v) reallocation of cost categories, including textbooks, from development costs to revenue costs. \nAll activities funded by the government revenue budget are essential to implement the reforms \nplanned under PEDP3. Allocation in the development budget did not increase because of the \n(i) reallocation  of  cost  categories,  (ii)  rationalization  of  the  original  costing  based  on \nimplementation experience, and (iii) activities that were originally planned to be integrated in \nPEDP3  in  the  later  years  remaining  outside  PEDP3  in  discrete  projects.  These  projects \ncontribute to achieving the overall sector targets. However, as these projects have separate \nimplementation arrangements and financing agreements, they are not funded by PEDP3.12 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nOriginal  Revised \n  Amount  Amounta \nItem  2011  2015  2015 \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR87,533,000 ($120 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance eligible \nPEDP3 expenditures under the government\u2019s program budget heads. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the \ngrace  period  and  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \n19.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  PEDP3  is  currently  cofinanced  by  eight  other \ndevelopment partners for a total of $735.5 million, comprising a $300.0 million equivalent loan \n                                                \n12 Discrete projects include stipends, school feeding, nonformal primary education, and construction projects. The \nIslamic Development Bank and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China support construction projects \nunder a separate agreement. The World Bank and the European Union support nonformal education projects that \nstarted before PEDP3 and have separate agreements that prescribe engagement of NGOs in implementation. The \ngovernment-funded  stipend  project,  which  started  before  PEDP3,  was  extended  since  changing  the \nimplementation arrangements to incorporate it into PEDP3 at the MTR stage was not realistic. \n ", "6   \nfrom the World Bank and $435.5 million equivalent in grants from other development partners. \nADB\u2019s additional financing of $120.0 million represents 5.2% of the total additional financing and \nADB\u2019s original and additional financing represents 4.5% of the total PEDP3 cost. In addition to \nADB, four other development partners will provide additional financing of an estimated $546.6 \nmillion.  The  joint  financing  arrangement  will  be  updated  accordingly.  The  government  has \nindicated that it will provide an additional $1,665.2 million equivalent for PEDP3. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Original \nAdditional \nAmount  Total \nFinancing \n  2011  2015  2015 \n  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of \nSource  Total (%)  Total (%)  Total (%)  Total (%) \nAsian Development  320.00  3.8  320.00  4.3  120.00  5.2  440.00  4.5 \nBank \n   Special Funds  \n   resources (loan) \nOther development  735.50  8.8  735.50  9.8  546.60  23.4  1,282.10  13.1 \npartners \nGovernment  7,281.48  87.4  6,420.40  85.9  1,665.20  71.4  8,085.59  82.4 \n                Total  8,336.98  100.0  7,475.90  100.0  2,331.80  100.0  9,807.69  100.0 \nNotes:   \n1.

The MTR confirmed that the implementation arrangements agreed at the start of PEDP3 \nwill not be changed. The MOPME is the executing agency and the DPE is the key implementing \nagency. The MOPME will continue to lead overall coordination of the PEDP3 and the DPE will \nformulate  guidelines  and  plans;  and  implement,  supervise,  and  monitor  PEDP3.  For \nimplementation of specific parts of PEDP3, other agencies at the national level will continue to \nbe responsible. Detailed project management arrangements, as agreed with the government in \nthe revised program document, are set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \n21.  Procurement  arrangements.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  continue  to  be  used  to \nfinance goods, works, and related services procured using national competitive bidding.14 Such \nprocurement follows the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006, and Public Procurement \nRules, 2008, with modifications to and/or clarifications on the procedures agreed between the \ngovernment, ADB, and other development partners as set out in the PAM, procurement plan, \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Since all contracts are jointly cofinanced by other development partners, universal procurement will apply (ADB. \n2013.  Blanket  Waiver  of  Member  Country  Procurement  Eligibility  Restrictions  in  Cases  of  Cofinancing  for \nOperations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila). \n ", "7 \nand  the  joint  financing  arrangement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Aside  from  ADB,  other \ndevelopment partners jointly finance goods, works, and related services procured using national \ncompetitive  bidding.  Based  on  the  performance  in  the  first  years  of  the  program,  specific \ncapacity development actions have been agreed during MTR, as reflected in the PFM action \nplan, to continue mitigating risks and improving performance. After successfully pilot testing e-\nprocurement for works contracts under PEDP3, PEDP3 will support the Local Government \nEngineering  Department  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health  Engineering  to  expand \ne-procurement.  ADB  will  not  finance  any  goods  and  works  that  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  as  this  will  follow  World  Bank  guidelines.  All  consulting \nservices will be engaged using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The World Bank will not finance consulting services.  \n \n22.  Disbursement conditions and arrangements. The existing arrangement will continue. \nFunds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  the  government\u2019s  consolidated  funds  based  on  withdrawal \napplications  submitted  by  the  DPE.  The  statement  of  expenditure  format  is  based  on \nsemiannual interim unaudited financial reports, and is used for harmonized financial reporting \nand reimbursement. The interim unaudited financial reports reflect eligible expenditures. \n \n23.  ADB will continue to reimburse the government every 6 months in accordance with \narrangements for the original loan: (i) 50% on achievement of annual DLIs that will be priced \nequally, submission of agreed reports, and receipt of statement of expenditure; and (ii) 50% on \nreceipt of statement of expenditure. Disbursement schedules for the ongoing loan and the \nadditional financing are harmonized to maintain this arrangement.15 \n \n24.  All implementation arrangements, summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nupdated  PAM,  will  remain  the  same.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  annually  approve  the \nprocurement plan for national competitive bidding\u2014ADB for consulting services and the World \nBank for international competitive bidding. An 18-month procurement plan has been included in \nthe updated PAM, the program document, and the World Bank\u2019s additional financing documents. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2015\u2013June 2017  \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2017; Loan closing date 31 December 2017a \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Program steering committee  \nSecretary of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (chair) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Primary and Mass Education \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Directorate of Primary Education \nProcurement  International competitive bidding for works and goods will not be eligible for \nADB financing. \nNational competitive bidding  18,000 contracts  $1,125 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  830 person-months  $9 million \n(indefinite delivery contract and \nindividual consultant selection) \nRetroactive financing and/or  The loan will finance eligible expenditures pertaining to the period from \nadvance contracting  1 January 2015 to the effective date, covering eligible expenditures up to 20% \nof the loan amount.  \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \n                                                \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "8   \nAspects   Arrangements \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.

Third  Primary  Education  Development  Program.  Dhaka;  Asian \nDevelopment Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic  viability.  The  economic  analysis  provides  the  rationale  for  additional \nfinancing for the project, and assesses the benefits and costs associated with the additional \nfinancing.  The  project  investment  is  the  estimated  additional  cost  above  current  PEDP3 \nspending. The benefits are related to changes in quantity and quality, and a reduction in the \ninternal inefficiency of education produced over the period as a result of the PEDP3. The \nbenefits are broadly assumed from two possible sources: (i) an increased number of primary \nschool completers who earn higher wages (relative to non-completers), and (ii) an increased \nquality of education resulting in a higher wage premium for all primary school completers. Costs \nare associated with additional program costs from government and development partners as a \nresult of the increased number of primary school teachers and increased salary levels. The \nadditional financing will finance a 1-year extension of implementation until June 2017. The \neconomic internal rate of return associated with this net present value is 18.8% for the whole \nprogram, which suggests that the additional financing under PEDP3 is an economically sound \ninvestment. \n  \n26.  Fiscal sustainability. The long-run sustainability of the additional financing lies within \nthe original framework of PEDP3, which depends on two factors: (i) adequate budget to the \nMOPME to maintain the investment plan, and (ii) continuity in the flow of improvements in \nquality and efficiency. The estimated resource envelope and the current gross domestic product \ngrowth trend indicate that it will not be difficult for the Ministry of Finance to allocate the required \namount for PEDP3 (FY2015\u2013FY2017). The allocation of a higher share of budget to primary \neducation by the government is ensured since (i) the government\u2019s national education policy \nproposes  a  significant  increase  in  budget  allocation  to  the  education  sector;  and  (ii) \ndevelopment  partner  support  is  linked  to  both  results  and  assurances  that  sector  budget \nallocations are in line with the medium-term budgetary framework. Efficiency gains are expected \nto benefit Bangladesh\u2019s primary education sector as a result of the reforms being supported by \nPEDP3, including improved financial management, electronic procurement, and strengthened \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  which  also  keep  costs  down  while  improving  overall  education \noutcomes. These will continue reinforcing the long-term fiscal sustainability of Bangladesh\u2019s \nprimary education sector. \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n27.  Financial due diligence work was carried out as part of the MTR and additional financing \nprocessing in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and \n ", "9 \nFinancial Due Diligence Methodology Note.16 This analysis confirmed that the chosen modality \nis sustainable. The overall fiduciary risk, although substantial, remains manageable as a result \nof the measures provided in the PFM action plan, supported by targeted technical assistance to \nimprove government capacity, and is regularly updated following quarterly and annual fiduciary \nreviews and post-procurement audits.17 Based on the MTR recommendation, and upon request \nfrom the Government of Bangladesh, the deadline for sharing the annual audited program \nfinancial statements has been extended to 9 months after completion of each fiscal year. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, MOPME, and DPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Positive effects of public investment in education and health, and NGOs\u2019 contribution in \neconomic and social empowerment activities, have contributed to significant improvement in \npoverty reduction in the 1990s and 2000s. Enrolment and retention are improving, but the \nschool age children not enrolled in primary education (3%) are from the most disadvantaged \nbackgrounds. PEDP3 will focus on implementation of the harmonized plans to ensure these \nchildren come to and stay in school. This will support providing PPE to the most needy, supply \nof free textbooks, tuition waivers, provision of second chance education, inclusive education, \nand quality improvements. MOPME will continue with the stipend and school feeding program. \n \n29.  Gender and development. Gender equity in primary school enrollment, retention, and \nin teacher recruitment in government primary schools has been achieved. However, efforts are \nneeded to include gender and equity perspectives in all regular activities in primary education. A \ngender equity framework (gender action plan), which is part of the inclusive education action \nplan, has been implanted in the first years and has been updated for the remaining period.18 \nThe poverty, social, and gender due diligence for the original project still suffices, and gender \ncategorizations and gender action plan commitments continue. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The project remains \nenvironment category B. The common harmonized environmental management framework was \nprepared at the start with the World Bank and reviewed, resulting in minor adjustments as part \nof  the  MTR  and  additional  financing  process.  Implementation  is  compliant  and  no  major \nchanges were made. The project remains category B for both involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  safeguards.  The  common  harmonized  social  management  framework, \nwhich includes both aspects, was prepared at the start with the World Bank and reviewed \nthoroughly, with further strengthening in gender inclusiveness and the monitoring process as \npart of the MTR and additional financing. No major changes were made and implementation is \ncompliant.  No  private  homesteads  will  be  acquired  nor  will  vulnerable  squatters  be  made \nhomeless. The two joint frameworks harmonize ADB and World Bank safeguards policies, and \nshow the exemplary development partner collaboration. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2005.

Among the key program implementation risks identified at the start, two remain prevalent. \nThe first relates to inadequate institutional and personnel capacity to manage, implement, and \nmonitor  the  PEDP3. The  project  combines  institutional  strengthening, decentralization,  and \nhuman resource development to increase the government\u2019s institutional and personnel capacity. \nThe  second  risk  relates  to  fiduciary  risks  associated  with  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement. The project includes a strong joint fiduciary review mechanism by ADB and the \nWorld  Bank  in  close consultation  with  other  development  partners,  supported  by  technical \nassistance provided by different development partners including ADB to support strengthening \nof fiduciary oversight. Use of the treasury system by channeling of all development partner \nfunds through the government\u2019s treasury to finance PEDP3 eligible expenditures, including use \nof  the  integrated  budget  and  accounting  system  for  consolidated  reporting,  are  major \nachievements in financial management. The joint PFM action plan is in place to improve the \nfiduciary environment. The integrated benefits and impact of PEDP3 are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. The risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.19  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and the MOPME have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and the MOPME have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  \nSDR87,533,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Third \nPrimary Education Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n24 April 2015\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK    \nData Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Performance TaBragseetsli naensda  Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n(Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact       \nCurrent project   Current project      Assumption \nGovernment is \nQuality education  Level of achievement in Grade 3 and 5   \ncommitted to \nfor all Bangladeshi  mean score in Bangla and mathematics in \nimplement agreed \nchildren  2016: 75% (3 Bangla), 35% (5 Bangla), 60% \npolicies. \n(3 mathematics), and 45% (5 mathematics) \n \nfor both sexes, boys, and girls.

Especially for those indicators, the DLIs are used. The original DLI \nmatrix was only very specific for the year 0, year 1, year 2, and year 3 DLIs; for years 4 and 5, one broader \nindicator was defined with the understanding that this would be specified during midterm review. During the review, \nthis specification has taken place, and six DLIs for year 6 are added. The majority of the original output indicators \nwas taken from the broad-based year 4 and 5 DLIs, and are now specified based on implementation experience. \nAll of the targets are included in the government results framework with which ADB harmonizes.  \nb  In the design and monitoring framework approved in 2011, the activities and milestones were structured annually \nwith a focus on the overall review cycle to comply with ADB guidelines. These guidelines have been changed after \nthe start of the program, and activities and milestones now need to be presented by each output. This required a \nfull revision of the original milestones and activities. Therefore, to inform about changes compared to the original \nloan only the remark \u201ccompleted\u201d is used, as the remarks \u201cchanged,\u201d \u201cunchanged,\u201d and \u201cadded\u201d have no value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=42122-016-3 \n \n1.
