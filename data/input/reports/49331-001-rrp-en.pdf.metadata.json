The  government\u2019s  program  will:  \n(i)  ensure  greater  financial  stability;  (ii)  deepen  the  capital  markets;  and  (iii)  promote  financial \ninclusion  with  a  focus  on  expanding  microfinance  and  financial  technology.  The  program  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for delivery in 2018.1 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3.  \nThe  development  problem.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  growth  is  among  the  highest  in  the \nregion \u2013 gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.8% in 2017. While the overall macroeconomic \noutlook  is  positive,  Viet  Nam  remains  vulnerable  to  several  risks  due  to  the  long-standing \nstructural  weaknesses  in  the  economy,  including  inefficient  investment  related  to  the  low \nproductivity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the undercapitalized and inefficient banking \nsector.2 Financial  buffers are  thin and the macroeconomic frameworks  are  inflexible,  making  it \nharder to manage possible shocks, including disruptions in the global supply chains.3 As Viet Nam \nbecomes increasingly integrated into the global economy, with trade accounting for two times its \nGDP, Viet Nam must address these impediments to  remain competitive and meet the national \ngrowth targets of 6.5%\u20137.0% in its Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS), 2011\u20132020.4 \nInitiatives to improve the investment climate and strengthen the finance sector for more efficient \nand inclusive financial intermediation will be required.  \n \nAgainst this  backdrop, the government  is  concerned with the prospect  of rising  income \n4. \ninequality. While 50 million people have been lifted out of poverty since 1993, pockets of poverty \nremain,  especially  in  Northern midlands and mountainous areas  and Central  Highlands  where \nethnic  minorities  live.  While  income  inequality  is  less  severe  compared  to  other  neighboring \ncountries, it has increased notably within a short period of time, with the official Gini coefficient \nrising from 0.42 in 2002 to 0.43 in 2014. In rural areas, income inequality has increased much \nfaster, with the Gini coefficient rising from 0.36 in 2002 to 0.40 in 2014.5 Moreover, an ADB study \nshows  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  economic  growth  has  exhibited  pro-rich  gains,  with  returns  to \nagriculture and manufacturing increasing only for the wealthiest 10%\u201320% of the population.6  \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

No.681. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fTo  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  tackle  rising  income \n5. \ninequality,  the  government  has  been  implementing  several  strategies  to  provide  the  poor  with \ngreater  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as  education,  health  care,  and  public  housing. \nInvestments  in  basic  infrastructure  including  transportation,  electricity,  and  water  are  also \nprioritized to improve the livelihood and connectivity of people living in rural areas. To implement \nthese strategies, the government has targeted social investment spending between 32%\u201334% of \nGDP  over  the  next  5  years.  Achieving  this  target  will  be  a  challenge  as Viet  Nam  is  currently \nfacing  the  multi-year  budget  deficits  (4.3%  of  GDP  in  2016  and  3.5%  of  GDP  in  2017, \nrespectively).7 At  the  same  time,  the  banking  sector  is  weak,  under-capitalized  and  unable  to \neffectively mobilize long-term domestic resources to finance these investments. Non-performing \nloans (NPL) and problem banks continue to pose threats to the entire financial system and limit \nits ability to support the real sector. The government has also recognized that alternative funding \nsources will be needed, and that a stable and developed domestic capital market will be the main \nchannel  to  mobilize  longer-term  domestic  resources.  However,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  capital  market  is  \nunder-developed, with domestic government bond market representing only 38% of GDP in 2017, \ncompared to an average 70% in emerging East Asia. The corporate bond market is highly illiquid \nand only represented 3.2% of GDP as of end 2017. \n \n6. \nIn  addition,  empirical  evidence  shows  a  direct  linkage  between  financial  inclusion  and \nincome equality. This is because financial exclusion deprives the poor of opportunities to increase \nincomes through savings, access capital for investment, and mitigate financial risks arising from \nnatural disasters and economic shocks.8 In Viet Nam, financial inclusion is low by all measures \n(Figure 1). In 2017, only 30.8% of adults had a bank account, compared to 81.6% in Thailand and \n85.3% in Malaysia. These measures are even lower among the poorest 40% of the population \n(20.0%) and the rural inhabitants (25.0%). The percentage of Vietnamese adults with savings at \na financial institution was only 14.5%, much lower than those of many regional peers. 9   \n\nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion Index  \n\n \n\nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates.

Washington, DC.   \n\n9  World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex 2017.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial  stability,  capital  market  development  and  financial  inclusion  are  the three key \n7. \npillars  of  finance  sector  development.  Financial  stability  ensures  investor  confidence,  attracts \nlong-term  investment,  and  reduces  the  overall  business  operating  costs.  Capital  market \ndevelopment facilitates longer-term, stable and affordable funding sources for public investment \nin social sectors and infrastructure. Finally, financial inclusion ensures wider participation and that \nthe economic benefits generated are accessible to all.  \n \n8.  \nBinding  constraints.  The  government  recognizes  the  challenges  that  need  to  be \naddressed  in  its  efforts  to  reform  the  finance  sector.  Three  key  binding  constraints  have  been \nidentified:  (i)  limited  capacity  to  maintain  finance  sector  stability;  (ii)  underdeveloped  capital \nmarkets; and (iii) low financial inclusion. \n \nLimited  capacity  to maintain finance sector  stability.  Coordinated  oversight  of  both \n9.  \nindividual institutions and the overall financial system is necessary to maintain financial stability \neffectively. The government faces three key impediments to maintaining financial stability. First, \nthe  current  supervisory  and  regulatory  framework  is  divided  among  multiple  agencies,  which \noperate  without  a  comprehensive  financial  stability  framework.  Second,  banking  supervision \nremains  weak  and  does  not  meet  international  standards,  such  as  Basel  2.  Banks\u2019  lending \npractices remain risky and credit continues to flow into unproductive sectors, such as SOEs and \nreal  estate.  Although  the  government  reduced  the  NPL  ratio  from  17%  in  September  2012  to \naround 5% by the end of 2017,10 effective NPL resolution has been nominal, as the Vietnam Asset \nManagement  Company  (VAMC)  is  constrained  by  limited  capital,  restrictive  laws,  and \ncumbersome  foreclosure  processes.11 Third,  the  underlying  architecture  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  finance \nsector  threatens  financial  stability.  The  use  of  a  commercial  bank  to  support  the  settlement  of \ngovernment securities transactions introduces credit risk into what should be a risk-free process. \nThe Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS) do not reflect the International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS), distorting financial disclosures and inhibiting robust risk management.   \n \nUnderdeveloped  capital  market.  The  government  has  made  measurable  progress  in \n10. \ndeveloping Viet Nam\u2019s capital market in recent years, including a more regular issuance pattern \nof government securities at key tenors. However, the government\u2019s reforms have not consistently \nembraced  the  necessary  sequencing,  leaving  some  fundamental  development  constraints \nunresolved.  First,  the  capital  market  is  not  supported  by  a  reliable  short-term  interest  rate \nbenchmark,  which  is  often  derived  from  a  functioning  and  liquid  money  market.  The  lack  of  a \nshort-term  reference  rate  inhibits  the  accurate  market  valuation  of  financial  instruments  and \nprevents  the  development  of  more  advanced  markets,  such  as  derivatives.  Second,  while \nbenchmark securities are forming at key tenors, they have not yet reached critical mass. Historical \noperational restrictions and the lack of a strong institutional investor base with a demand for longer \ndated assets have limited the average maturity of government bonds to just over 4 years in 2015. \nFinally,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  categorization as a  \u201cfrontier\u201d  market  and  limits  on the foreign  ownership of \npublic  companies  have  discouraged  the  entry  of  international  investors  with  the  capacity  to \nsupport and bring international best practices into the domestic market. \n\n11.  \nLow  financial  inclusion.  Inadequate  access  to  financial  services  and  products,  low \nfinancial literacy, and incomplete consumer protection have excluded a large share of the adult \npopulation from the finance sector. First, financial services for low-income people remain centered \non government-subsidized microcredit provided by the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP). \n                                                \n10 The figure as of the end of September 2012 was based on closer surveillance by the SBV. The figure by the end of \n\n2017 was reported by credit institutions and the VAMC. \n\n11 Since its inception in 2013, the VAMC has acquired from credit institutions an estimated $14 billion worth of NPLs, \n\nof which only about 27.5% have been resolved.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nSecond, other financial services for the poor and migrant workers such as savings, payments, \nremittances, and microinsurance services have not been fully developed. Viet Nam has a huge \npotential  to  adopt  technology  to  leapfrog  the  traditional  stages of financial  sector  development \nand support greater financial inclusion thanks to the high digital connection rates and the young \nand technology-savvy population. However, development of financial technology in Viet Nam is \nstill at an early stage. In 2017, only 23% of Vietnamese adults had used digital payments. The \ngovernment has yet to provide a comprehensive development and regulatory framework for digital \nfinancial services and agent banking. These services often require lower cost of operations, have \nlarge  distribution  networks  and  can  enable  financial  institutions  to  compete  with  VBSP  on \ncommercial terms. In addition, the Law on Insurance should be amended to allow microinsurance \nfor low-income customers to mitigate risks associated with a loss of income and assets. Finally, \nfinancial literacy in Viet Nam is low, with the financial literacy index (12.0) being one of the lowest \namong  30  countries.12 National  financial  literacy  programs  should be  developed  and rolled  out \nnation-wide to better target the financially excluded population.   \n \nB. \n \n12.  \nThe government\u2019s reform agenda. The Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u20132020 \nseeks to promote a modern and equitable market economy. The government targets economic \ngrowth of 6.5%\u20137.0%, an increase in per capita GDP to $3,200\u2013$3,500, and a 1.0%\u20131.5% annual \nreduction in the poverty rate by 2020.13 Recognizing the importance of financial stability, capital \nmarket  development,  and  financial  inclusion  in  achieving  these  targets,  the  government  has \ninitiated a series of finance sector reforms intended to strengthen the finance sector. In addition, \nthe government has completed a bond market road map for 2017\u20132020 that focuses on improving \nthe  liquidity  of  both  primary  and  secondary  markets,  extending  the  average  maturity  of \ngovernment  bonds,  and  encouraging  the  participation  of  long-term  nonbank  investors.  Finally, \nwhile Viet Nam\u2019s financial inclusion agenda is at an early stage, the government has placed an \nincreasing  focus  on  expanding  financial  access  for  the  unserved  and  the  underserved.  The \nNational  Financial  Inclusion  Strategy  (NFIS),  which  builds  on  the  ADB-supported  National \nMicrofinance  Development  Strategy  2011\u20132020, 14  is  being  formulated  to  incorporate  new \ndevelopments in inclusive finance including digital financial services and financial literacy. \n \nPolicy reforms. The program is aligned with the SEDS, 2011\u20132020 and aims to increase \n13. \nthe role of the nonbank finance sector and deepen the financial markets in Viet Nam. The effect \nof  these  reforms  is  a  deeper  and  more  inclusive  finance  sector.  Subprogram  1  contains  \n26 reform measures, 9 of which are policy triggers and 17 are policy milestones.15 All subprogram \n1 policy actions have been accomplished. Subprogram 2 contains 25 reform policy actions, 8 of \nwhich are expected prior actions.  \n \n14. \nFinance  sector  stability  strengthened.  This  reform  area  will  institutionalize  financial \nstability functions, strengthen the banking sector and the underlying infrastructure. Subprogram \n1 achieved several targets. First, the SBV established a framework for a formal financial stability \nfunction supported by systemic risk surveillance. To reduce systemic risk, the SBV required all \ncommercial banks to fully comply with Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 of the Basel 2 standardized approach \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

Ha Noi. \n\n15 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement condition, and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fby 2020. This reform was complemented by immediate actions to reduce the sector\u2019s reliance on \nshort-term volatile funding, reduce related party lending, tighten securities margin lending, and \ndeter  speculative  real  estate  lending  activities.  Second,  the  SBV  amended  the  Law  on  Credit \nInstitutions  to  introduce  prompt  corrective  actions  for  problem  banks  based  on  their  level  of \ncapital. The new law specifies the resolution regime for problem banks, including rehabilitation, \nforced  merger  and  acquisition  and  declaration  of  bankruptcy.  This  provided  the  SBV  with  a \nstronger legal mandate to resolve weak credit institutions which have been a drag to the banking \nsector. The SBV also strengthened the VAMC\u2019s ability to acquire effective control of bad debts by \nutilizing a wider array of funding mechanisms. Finally, the government addressed long-standing \nweaknesses in financial infrastructure by amending the Law on Accounting to gradually align the \nVAS with the IFRS and implementing a roadmap to strengthen the securities settlement process.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  reforms  begun  under \n15. \nsubprogram 1 by strengthening systemic risk surveillance and banking sector performance. The \nSBV  will:  (i)  implement  supervisory  guidelines  for  systemically  important  domestic  banks;  \n(ii) develop mechanisms to monitor and control financial stability risks; (iii) implement the early \nintervention  and  resolution  framework  for  weak  credit  institutions;  and  (iv)  adopt  a  formal \nsupervisory  bank  rating  system.  The  SBV  will  require  all  banks  to  fully  comply  with  Basel  2, \nincluding the implementation of Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) by 2021, \nand will further reduce the banking system\u2019s reliance on short-term funding.  \n \n16. \nDomestic  capital  market  broadened  and  deepened.  This  reform  area  will:  (i)  further \ndevelop the money market; (ii) deepen and enlarge the government bond market; and (iii) develop \nan institutional investor base. Subprogram 1 has several accomplishments. The SBV allowed a \nwider  foreign  exchange  trading  range  for  the  dong,  installed  a  Reuters  platform  to  capture \ninterbank money market activities, and completed a diagnostic to support the establishment of a \nshort-term interest rate benchmark. To increase activities and liquidity in the money market, the \nSBV provided regulatory relief and prepared a standardized repurchase agreement. To provide a \nterm structure of interest rates, the government conducted a continuous primary auction process \nof  government  securities  at  key  tenors  of  the  yield  curve,  including  the  30-year  tenor,  and \nintroduced the prerequisites for an active secondary market. To develop an institutional investor \nbase, the government provided an enabling environment for private pension funds and authorized \nthe  social  security  system  to  invest  in  government  bonds.  Efforts  to  upgrade  Viet  Nam  to \n\u201cemerging market\u201d status were begun, with a focus on liberalizing foreign ownership restrictions \non listed companies.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  SBV  will  take  additional  measures  to  support  a  more  active \n17. \nforeign  exchange  market  and  will  implement  reforms  to  improve  transparency  in  the  money \nmarket. The SBV will fully identify constraints to money market development and will facilitate the \ncompletion of key legal opinions from trade associations. The government will continue its primary \nauction  process  across  all  maturities  and  will  enhance  liquidity  by  building  benchmarks  and \nreducing the number of outstanding issues. A legal framework for a Primary Dealer system and \nthe associated liquidity support facility will be completed and the development of derivatives will \nbe actively pursued. To foster the development of an institutional investor base, the government \nwill allow the operation of private pension funds and encourage the participation of social security \nsystem in the government bond auctions. Finally, to further promote capital market development, \nthe government  will  revise the  Securities Law  to  be  more aligned with international  standards, \nincluding corporate governance, disclosure, and investor protection. \n \n18. \nFinancial inclusion promoted. This reform area will provide holistic support for access \nto financial services by the unserved and underserved population. Although the financial inclusion \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fagenda is at a very early stage, subprogram 1 has achieved notable accomplishments. The SBV \nwas appointed the national coordinator for planning and implementing national financial inclusion \ninitiatives. The SBV\u2019s Fintech Steering Committee was established and a framework to promote \nnoncash payment services was developed as prerequisites for promoting financial technology to \nachieve greater financial inclusion. To create an enabling environment for the microfinance sector, \nthe  SBV  formalized  the  legal  framework  for  the  sector  and  introduced  a  framework  to  foster \nalternative payment systems. The government introduced agent-based microinsurance as a new \nfinancial product. Finally, an improved rating system that focused on governance and asset quality \nenhanced the supervision of people\u2019s credit funds.  \n \n19.   Subprogram 2 will strengthen the legal framework for financial inclusion  to include new \ndevelopments  such  as  financial  technology  while  increasing  focus  on  financial  literacy  and \nconsumer  protection.  The  government  will  develop  a  national  financial  inclusion  framework \nincluding  financial  literacy  programs  such  as  national  television  game  shows  on  financial \nknowledge.  In  addition,  to  enhance  financial  inclusion  through  innovation  and  to  promote  a \ncashless  society,  the  SBV  will  develop  and  implement  an  action  plan  to  develop  financial \ntechnology in Viet Nam. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will submit the proposal to the National \nAssembly to include microinsurance business in the revised Law on Insurance. The new rating \nsystem will be fully applied to people\u2019s credit funds to strengthen their governance and capital \nbase.  The  SBV  will  evaluate  and  register  microfinance  programs  and  projects  under  the  new \nframework and raise awareness on the new licensing regime for MFIs.  \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s experience and strategy. ADB\u2019s engagement in finance sector development in \nViet  Nam  began  with  three  successive  clusters  of  finance  sector  program  loans  (Figure  2). \nBuilding on these engagements, the Financial Sector Deepening Program adopted a sequenced \napproach  to  address  outstanding  foundational  constraints  to  capital  market  development  by \nfostering the emergence of a money market and government securities market. At the same time, \nADB  supported  financial  inclusion  through  the  Microfinance  Development  Program. 16  Both \nprograms were rated successful.17 This program represents the next logical step in ADB\u2019s support \nby combining finance sector development and financial inclusion under an umbrella framework \ndesigned  to  bring  together  the  supply  and  demand  sides  of  finance  sector  development.  The \nprogram  will  also  complement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  public  expenditure  efficiency. 18 The \nprogram is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030 (Table 1).19 \n \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n1.

The  program\u2019s  design  was  informed  by  four  key  lessons  learned \nthrough ADB\u2019s engagement in finance sector development.20 First, the pace of reforms must be \nat a pace that recognizes that finance sector reform is a long-term process and requires proper \nsequencing. The effectiveness of foundation reforms should be fully demonstrated before more \ncomplex reforms are introduced. Second, to increase government ownership, the program, should \nbe focused and consist of targeted high-impact policy actions. Third, complementary reforms are \nnecessary to increase financial stability and boost investor confidence and participation. Finally, \nfinancial  inclusion  reforms  should  adopt  a  holistic  approach,  considering  both  the  supply  and \ndemand side, and incorporating new developments in financial inclusion. \n \n22.   ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  the  program.    ADB\u2019s  long  term  engagement  in  the  finance \nsector has helped ensure that the reform areas are well-sequenced and policy actions are well \nformulated. Through policy dialogue and technical assistance (TA), ADB has contributed directly \nto several reforms under the program. As the lead donor, ADB has supported the SBV to establish \nand strengthen the financial stability function. ADB\u2019s rapid response to the government\u2019s needs \nhave contributed to the amendment of the Credit Institutions Law which provided the SBV with \nstrong  legal  mandate  to  resolve  NPLs  and  restructure  problem  banks.  Through  the  OneADB \napproach,  ADB  experts  from  Southeast  Asia  Department  and  Treasury  Department  are \nsupporting  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a  short-term  benchmark  interest  rate  through \npolicy dialogue and capacity development. ADB also provided an interbank transaction reporting \nplatform to increase transparency and is supporting the early-stage development of derivatives \n\n                                                \n20 ADB.  2008.

ADB\u2019s assistance was instrumental in establishing a framework for the development of \nprivate pension funds. ADB is also the lead donor in financial inclusion with the support to develop \nthe national microfinance development strategy 2011\u20132020, which provided a foundation for the \nforthcoming NFIS. Finally, ADB\u2019s capacity development to the policymakers and partnership with \nthe  private  sector  on  Fintech  Challenge  events  have  provided  the  foundation  for  fintech \ndevelopment for greater financial inclusion in Viet Nam. \n \n23.   ADB\u2019s  assistance  has  contributed  to  impressive  results.  Average  trading  volume  per \ntransaction in the government bond market increased by nearly eight times from VND 1.2 trillion \nin 2010 to VND 9.2 trillion in 2017. The average maturity of government debts increased from  \n3.2 years in 2013 to 12.7 years in 2017. The share of outstanding government bonds held by the \ncontractual  savings  industry  increased  from  15.4%  in  2013  to  45.8%  in  2017,  and  47.5%  in \nSeptember  2018,  respectively.  The  combined  stock  market  capitalization  of  the  two  stock \nexchanges  increased  from  19%  of  GDP  in  2010  to  nearly  75%  of  GDP  in  2017.  Regarding \nfinancial inclusion, the revised Credit Institution Law designated MFIs as credit institutions and \nput  them  under  the  SBV\u2019s  supervision.  Microfinance  regulations  were  developed  to  guide  the \nMFIs\u2019  operations,  and  the  regulators\u2019  supervisory  capacity  improved  significantly.  The \ngovernment also approved a strategy to transform the VBSP into a more self-sustaining financial \ninstitution capable of carrying out market-based operations. Four private MFIs have been licensed, \nmost recently in 2016. In 2017, the SBV licensed a total 9 microfinance programs and projects \noperated  by  the  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  which  serve  primarily  low-income  female \nclients.  From  2014\u20132016,  the  number  of  microfinance  borrowers  increased  by  3  million,  the \nnumber of depositors increased by 2 million and outstanding loans increased by 15%. \n \n24.   Development partner coordination. To ensure that efforts to develop Viet Nam\u2019s finance \nsector are complementary, a donor coordination committee led by the World Bank meets quarterly. \nADB is leading capital market development by providing targeted support to develop money and \ndebt capital markets, as well as selective efforts to strengthen financial stability, the microfinance \nsector, and financial technology. ADB is coordinating with the World Bank to promote financial \ninclusion,  including  support  to  develop  and  implement  the  NFIS.  The  Government  of  Canada \n(through Global Affairs Canada) is supporting efforts to strengthen banking supervision, and the \nGovernment of Japan (through the Japan International Cooperation Agency) has been helping \nthe government develop the banking sector and NPL resolution strategies. ADB has collaborated \nclosely  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  the  policy  actions  under  the  program  are \nconsistent with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s assessment and recommendations. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nEconomic  impacts  of  the  program.  This  program  addresses  Viet  Nam\u2019s  need  for \ncomprehensive finance sector reforms. The program impact assessment estimates the program\u2019s \npotential net benefits at approximately $751 million. The present value of the program\u2019s aggregate \nbenefits is approximately $1.5 billion, which flows from reduced risk premiums on debt, increased \nintermediation from the nonbank sector, and greater inclusion through the microfinance sector. \nThe present value of the program\u2019s aggregate costs is $708 million due primarily to the additional \ninterest  cost  associated  with  maintaining  a  term  structure  of  interest  rates  over  increasing \nmaturities. The compliance costs to the banking sector associated with the adoption of Basel 2 \nare also expected to be substantial. 21 \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nD. \n \n26. \nThe  government  of  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  a  programmatic \napproach,  comprising  two  subprograms,  and  a  concessional  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; \nand such  other terms  and conditions  set forth  in the  draft  loan  agreement. The  indicative loan \namount for subprogram 2 is $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The proceeds of \nthe policy-based loan will be disbursed to Viet Nam in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  total  financing  needs  for  2016\u20132020  are  expected  to  be  substantial,  with \nannual budget deficits projected at 3.5%\u20134.0% of GDP. The government\u2019s borrowing needs for \n2018  are  estimated  at  $17  billion,  of  which  official  development  assistance  and  concessional \nloans are estimated at $3.6 billion. The size of subprogram 1 reflects the government\u2019s financing \nneeds, the strength of the reform and development expenditures arising from the program. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  executing  agency  is  the  SBV,  and  the  implementing  agencies  are  the  MOF,  State \nSecurities Commission, Hanoi Stock Exchange, and SBV. Subprogram 1 was implemented from \nJuly 2015 to June 2018. Subprogram 2 began in July 2018 and will be implemented through June \n2020.  While  a  formal  coordinating  committee  has  not  been  created  to  support  the  program, \nspecific reform measures, such as the development of a short-term interest rate benchmark and \nthe introduction of derivatives, have given rise to formal coordination structures across and within \nministries, and serve to catalyze broader cooperation.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n29.   Safeguards. The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  policies and is  classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous people.  \n \nPoverty  and  social.  Reforms  under  the  program  will  help  the  government  achieve  its \n30. \npoverty  reduction  target  by  providing  the  poor  with  greater  access  to  financial  services.  The \nprogram introduces two pro-poor products: (i) microinsurance, which provides a cushion against \nunexpected loss; and (ii) alternative payment systems, which will increase the access of the poor \nto low-cost financial services. Subprogram 1 is categorized as having some gender elements. By \nimproving  the  legal  framework  for  microfinance  operators  under  the  VWU,  which  accounts  for \n80%  of  all  semiformal  microfinance  providers,  more  women  will  be  able  to  access  savings \nproducts and apply for larger loans with a lower administrative burden and cost. The program also \nintroduces  new  financial  services  such  as  microinsurance  that  will  benefit  lower  income \ncustomers, many of whom are women.22 \n \n31. \nGovernance.  A  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted  and  noted  several \nweaknesses  in  governance,  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption. 23 \nChallenges  hampering  public  financial  management  include:  (i)  inefficient  domestic  resource \nmobilization; (ii) unproductive public resource allocation; (iii) low budget reliability; and (iv) weak \n\n                                                \n22 United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). 2016.

Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020. Ha Noi.   \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\faccountability, monitoring, and evaluation. To address these challenges, ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen public financial management systems through policy dialogue \nand  targeted  public  financial  management  interventions.  ADB  also  supported  the  technical \ndrafting  of  the  revised  Procurement  Law  and  related  prime  ministerial  decisions  that  regulate \nprivate  sector  investment.  Since  2014,  ADB  has  provided  the  government  with  more  targeted \nsupport \nfor  enhancing  public  asset  management  systems,  strengthening  public  debt \nmanagement,  reducing  risks  associated  with  government  guarantees,  and  strengthening \noversight of budget implementation (footnote 18). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n32. \nRisks and Mitigating Measures. The program has five substantial risks. First, the return \nof macroeconomic instability could depress capital market activities. Second, economic pressure \nmay prevent the government from applying market principles to the microfinance sector, blunting \nsome of the proposed reforms. The government can mitigate this risk by continuing to strengthen \nmacroeconomic conditions and reform SOEs. Third, governance risk may arise from weak public \nmanagement practices and corruption. The government, with ADB\u2019s assistance, can mitigate this \nrisk  by  strengthening  the  public  financial  management  system.  Fourth,  vested  interest  might \nrestrain government efforts to reform state-owned commercial banks. Finally, high fiscal pressure \ncould lead to further cuts in the resources available for government staff training. The government, \nwith  support  from  development  donors,  can  continue  strengthening  the  capacity  of  its  staff  to \nundertake  key  policy  reforms.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan. 24 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nagreement.  No  disbursement  shall  be  made  unless  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  government  has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Financial  Sector  Development  and  Inclusion \nProgram, and \nthe loan of $100,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Financial  Sector  Development  and  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% \nper year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n13 November 2018 \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nRole of the non-bank finance sector increased and financial markets in Viet Nam deepened (Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020).a \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the \nReform \nA deeper, more \ninclusive finance \nsector developed \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \nMacroeconomic \ninstability specific to  \nViet Nam hampers \nreform efforts. \n \n  \n\nReform Areas  \n1.
