The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Sector Background \n\n2. \nAggressive  development  throughout  Asia  has  put  substantial  pressure  on  the  region\u2019s \nresource  base  and  natural  environment. This  development  path  will  need  to  be  balanced  over \nthe  long  term  with  resource  alternatives  that  are  more  sustainable.  The  clean  energy  market \ncomprises  companies  and  projects  that  provide  solutions  to  improve  the  use  of  natural \nresources  to  reduce  negative  ecological  impacts.  Increasingly  broader  in  scope,  the  market \nembraces multiple industries with diverse needs and at varying points in the production cycle\u2014\ngeneration, procurement, use and reuse, and residual disposal.  (See Table 1 for examples of \nvarious industries related to the clean energy market.) \n \n\nTable 1: Industries Related to the Clean Energy Market \n \nPollution and \nWaste \n\nIndustrial \n\nIndustrial waste \nConsumer waste \nCarbon \nWater, air, soil \npollution \n\nAutomotives \nManufacturing \nTransport and \nlogistics \nBiochemicals \n\nConsumer \n\nGreen and \nsustainable goods \nand services \n\nEnergy \n\nElectricity generation \nStorage \nEfficiency and \ndemand \nmanagement \nFuels \nBiomass \n\nWater and \nAgriculture \nTreatment and \npurification \nDistribution and \nreclamation \nDesalination \nSustainable \nagriculture \n\nSource: CRAG Fund private placement memorandum, February 2010. \n \n3. \nThrough  a  combination  of  economic,  political,  regulatory,  and  social  drivers,  the  clean \nenergy industry has risen to prominence in mitigating strategic risks facing individual economies \nand  the  global  community.  Many  proponents  now  view  the  clean  energy  industry  as  the  most \nsignificant investment opportunity for 2010 to 2020. Investment in Asia and the Pacific provide a \nmeans to enhance investment returns in clean energy for three core reasons:   \n\n(i) \n\nAsia\u2019s demand for clean energy and technology solutions will outpace that of the \nrest  of  the  world.  With  some  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  economies  and  two  of  the \nworld\u2019s most populous nations, Asia is expected to remain a driver of world gross \ndomestic product (GDP) over the next several years, outpacing many developed-\nworld economies in the process. Asia\u2019s strong macroeconomic and demographic \ndrivers will continue to spur superior growth in demand for innovative solutions in \nenergy,  water  supply,  and  pollution  control.  Based  on  the  International  Energy \nAgency\u2019s  latest  estimates,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India \ntogether  are  expected  to  account  for  over  half  of  the  global  increase  in  energy \ndemand  from  current  levels  to  2030.  Combined,  Asia\u2019s  economies  should  drive \n60% of new energy demand.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n(ii) \n\nA disproportionate share of the supply chain for clean technologies will originate \nin Asia. As has been the case in other manufacturing sectors, the region should \nbenefit  disproportionately  from  its  unique  supply  chain  manufacturing  base.  For \nexample, even with limited domestic demand, the PRC has become the leading \nsolar photovoltaic module manufacturer globally.  \n\n(iii) \n\nAsia  is  relatively  underserved  by  dedicated  clean  energy  capital  sources, \nattracting  less  than  5%  of  clean  technology  investment  to  date,  versus  about \n15% of total private equity and venture capital investment. As satellite operations \nin the region are scaled back by firms without a core base in Asia because of the \ncurrent  global  economic  environment,  the  funds  are  well-positioned  to  be \nopportunistic and can capitalize on the reduced competition and focus of  earlier \nand existing investors.   \n\nRegulatory  status.  There  is  considerable  regulatory  support  for  the  clean  energy \n4. \nmarket.  The  governments  of  the  two  funds\u2019  target  countries  are  developing  mechanisms  to \nstimulate renewable energy and sustainable technology, as follows: \n \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  The  PRC\u2019s  policy  goals  provide  for  the  building  of  an \n5. \nenergy efficient society. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) sets the goal of quadrupling GDP \nby 2020, while only doubling energy consumption. Energy consumption per unit of GDP must be \ncut  by  20%  of  2005  levels  by  the  end  of  2010.  The  PRC\u2019s  Medium  and  Long-Term  Energy \nConservation Plan,1 if implemented in full, will limit energy consumption by 2020 to 3 billion tons \nof  coal  equivalent,  instead  of  the  4  billion  tons  of  coal  equivalent  predicted  if  current  trends \ncontinue.  Since  2004, the PRC has  been  building  an  ultra-high-voltage  electricity  transmission \ninfrastructure of the kind that renewable energy supporters in the United States and European \nUnion  are  seeking,  and  the  program  has  subsequently  become  the  cornerstone  of  power-grid \ndevelopment  of  the  current  5-year  plan,  further  expanding  opportunities  for  intermittent \nrenewable  energy  generation.  Additionally,  as  part  of  the  $498  billion  economic  stimulus \npackage  of  November  2008,  the  government  plans  to  enhance  sewage  and  waste  treatment \nfacilities,  prevent  water  pollution,  accelerate  forest  planting  programs,  and  increase  energy \nconservation initiatives and pollution control projects. \n \n6. \nIndia.  India  represents  one  of  the  most  attractive  current  investment  opportunities  in \nAsia due to the combination of (i) growth in demand for energy, (ii) liberalized electricity markets \nthat  facilitate  merchant  selling  and  off-take  structures  that  support  independent  power \nproducers,  (iii)  high  availability  of  untapped  natural  resources,  and  (iv)  mature  regulatory  and \nfiscal incentives for foreign and local investment in renewable energy. Nationally, the Ministry for \nNew  and  Renewable  Energy  provides  financial  support  and  implements  renewable  energy \npolicies.  The  Indian  Renewable  Energy  Development  Agency  (IREDA)  provides  low-cost \nfinancing.  At  the  state  level,  individual  state  regulatory  commissions  implement  renewable \npolicies. \n \n7. \nThe Government of India has set an objective of achieving an installed renewable-based \ngeneration capacity of 10,000 megawatts (MW) by 2012, largely in the areas of wind and small \nhydropower.  A  number  of  fiscal  benefits  in  the  form  of  duty  exemptions,  income  tax  holidays, \nand accelerated depreciation norms have been extended. In addition, the IREDA has also been \nextending financial support to interested investors. Some of the key legislative, policy, and other \nmeasures initiated by the various stakeholders for promoting renewable energy are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nthe  Electricity  Act  of  2003  provides  for  state  commissions  to  fix  a  minimum \npercentage for purchase of energy from renewable energy sources. Some of the \nstate commissions have initiated measures in this direction; \n\n                                                \n1 Beijing Energy Efficiency Center. Energy Saving. http://www.beconchina.org/energy_saving.htm. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\nthe National Tariff Policy recognizes that renewable sources of energy should be \noffered  a  preferential  tariff  (until  the  time  that  technologies  evolve)  so  that  they \ncan compete with conventional sources of electricity generation; \npower generation across India has been stepped up, with the federal government \nmaking strong promises to extend electricity across rural India between 2009 and \n2014. Decentralized renewables will play an important role in the proposed rural \nelectrification of almost 5,400 hamlets and villages as they speed up deployment \nand reduce the costs associated with transmission2; \nthe  government  is  attempting  to  provide  incentives  for  the  development  of \nhydropower  across  the  nation.  Legislation  has  been  proposed  to  allow  private \nhydroelectric power developers to be eligible over 5 years for a tariff that would \nguarantee a fixed return on investment, as well as allowing generators to improve \ntheir returns by selling up to 40% of their electricity on the spot market.3 \n\n \n8. \nThe  Philippines.  Driven  by  a  growing  population  and  increasing  energy  needs,  the \nenergy  market  in  the  Philippines  has  undergone  a  process  of  deregulation,  with  strong \ncontinuing support from the government for private investment in renewable energy generation. \nHighlights include the following measures: \n\nThe  Electricity  and  Power  Industry  Reform  Act  (2001),  which  provides  for  an \nopen and competitive power industry. \nThe Wholesale Electricity Supply Market (2006), which enables market forces to \nset energy prices. \nThe Renewable Energy Act (2008, implemented 2009), which provides \n(a) \n\nprioritization of  purchase, grid connection,  and transmission  of  electricity \ngenerated by companies from renewable energy sources; \nincome tax holidays for 7 years and reduced corporate tax thereafter; \nexemption from value added tax of generated renewable power ; \ntax exemption on income from carbon credits; and \na  maximum  1.5%  import  tax  on  original  equipment  and  facilities  to \nproduce renewable energy. \n\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Renewable Energy Act also provides for \n(a) \n\na  renewable  portfolio  standard  mechanism,  which  is  a  regulation  that \nrequires  the  increased  production  of  energy  from  renewable  energy \nsources; and \na feed-in tariff offering a guaranteed fixed price for at least 12 years (and \nwhich  must  be  above  market  rates)  for  electricity  produced  from \nrenewables, notably wind, small hydropower, and biomass. \n\n(b) \n\n \n9. \nThe combination of these factors makes the Philippines a very attractive environment for \nrenewable energy investment. The effect of positive legislation and deregulation is to raise both \nthe minimum and potential maximum of investment returns for an investor in renewable energy \nin  the  Philippines.  The  overall  output  from  the  stated  policy  is  seeking  to  increase  installed \ncapacity by 100% by 2013 (to more than 4 gigawatts).  \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n10. \nEach  of  the  funds  is  established  to  make  private  equity  investments  in  clean  energy \nprojects  and  companies  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  As  such,  they  are \n\n                                                \n2 Government of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2009. Government of India Statistics. Delhi. \n3 United States Department of Energy. 2008. International Energy Outlook. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20204, which seeks to reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand  quality  of  life  in  part  by  scaling  up  private  sector  development  and  supporting \nenvironmentally sustainable development, particularly with respect to projects that aim to reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions and that address climate change.     \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategies \n\n11. \nThe proposed investments are broadly aligned with the country strategies for the various \ncountries to be targeted by the funds, key among which are the PRC, India, and the Philippines.  \n \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  In  its  country  partnership  strategy5 (CPS)  with  ADB,  the \n12. \nPRC recognizes the need to improve its energy efficiency and redefine its energy mix toward a \nmore environmentally friendly combination. The country\u2019s goals as outlined in the CPS include \n(i) ensuring resource efficiency and environmental sustainability by adopting clean and efficient \nenergy,  among  other  important  sector-specific  platforms;  and  (ii)  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development  through  private  sector  financing  and  other \ninterventions needed to increase private sector participation in the development activities of the \nPRC.  The  second  goal  underscores  the  PRC\u2019s  recognition  of  the  need  for  private  sector \nparticipation in sustaining economic growth and meeting the targets set for the coming decades. \n \n13. \nThe PRC CPS further emphasizes that an increasing level of private sector involvement \nwould  address  certain  funding  gaps  and  investment  needs  in  the  country,  and  would \ncomplement  the  (relatively  limited)  public  sector  funds  dedicated  to  infrastructure,  including \nclean  energy.  While  the  public  sector  window  of  ADB  is  continuously  collaborating  with  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  to  improve  the  country's  regulatory  climate  for  both  local  and foreign \nclean  energy  investments,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  can  and  should,  in \nparallel, use its experience and competence to work with private entities in the PRC to catalyze \ninvestment into the clean energy sector. \n \nIndia.  India's  CPS6 for  2009\u20132012  emphasizes  the  urgent  need  to  carry  out  energy \n14. \ninfrastructure  projects  to  meet  future  power  requirements.  At  present,  coverage  of  rural \nhousehold  electrification,  for  example,  is  still  at  a  low  level  of  about  33%,  and  the  quality  of \npower remains poor due to \"(i) insufficient power generation capacities in these areas, (ii) lack of \noptimum  utilization  of  the  generation  capacity,  (iii)  an  inadequate  and  aging  sub-transmission \nand distribution network, (iv) large scale theft and a skewed tariff structure, (v) the slow pace of \nrural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity by the consumers.\"  \n \nThese challenges are seen to plague the country's energy security and the sustainability \n15. \nof economic progress. Thus, together with ADB, India has established an energy sector results \nframework within its strategy and has developed ambitious overall target outcomes, such as (i) \nadding  at  least  70  MW  of  solar  power  generation,  (ii)  adding  at  least  982  MW  of  hydropower \ngeneration,  and  (iii)  building  an  efficient  power  transmission  network.  The  strategy  similarly \nacknowledges  the  greater  role  of  the  private  sector  in  realizing  these  goals  through  funding \nsome of the needed infrastructure. \n \nThe  Philippines.  The  enactment  and  implementation  of  the  Electric  Power  Industry \n16. \nReform Act (EPIRA) initiated the privatization of the power sector in the country. It has created a \ncompetitive  landscape  for  participants  in  the  power  sector,  which  is  expected  to  provide \naffordable  electricity  tariffs  in  the  long  term.  The  EPIRA  also  started  supporting  ventures  to \n\n                                                \n4 ADB,  2007.

Renewable  energy  project  proposals \nincreased  in  recent  years  but  only  a  few  were  realized  (one  wind  energy  project  in  northern \nPhilippines and other small-scale waste-to-energy projects). As a result, the rapid urbanization \nin many parts of the country has strained the capacity of the limited number of power generating \nfacilities.  There  are  current  efforts  to  increase  these  installations  but  they  are  stymied  by  the \nlack  of  foreign  capital  investments  targeting  the  clean  energy  sector.  The  CPS  for  the \nPhilippines7 specifies  targets  in  the  energy  sector,  and  is  generally  geared  toward  achieving \nreliable and affordable electricity supply.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy 8  seeks  to  facilitate  a  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and \n17. \nuniversal  access  to  energy,  thereby  achieving  ADB\u2019s  vision  of  a  region  free  of  poverty.  The \nobjective  of  the  policy  is  to  help  DMCs  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  for \ninclusive  growth  in  a  socially,  economically,  and  environmentally  sustainable  way.  The  policy \nemphasizes  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy;  access  to  energy  for  all;  and  energy \nsector  reforms,  capacity  building,  and  governance.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  policy \nimplementation  will  be  based  in  part  on  private  sector  participation  (and  public\u2013private \npartnership)  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency  through  competition  and  an  increase  in \ninvestable  resources  in  DMCs.  ADB  and  other  multilateral  development  organizations  have \npoured capital into this sector through public sector loans and other financing mechanisms for \nclean  energy  projects.  However,  the  investment  has  been  insufficient  to  build  and  sustain  the \nincreasingly energy-intensive infrastructure and economic activities of countries in Asia and the \nPacific.  The  private  sector  must  fill  the  gap  by  allocating  financial  resources  and  technical \nexpertise for clean energy businesses in ADB's DMCs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned from Previous Operations \n\n18. \nADB has learned lessons from its experiences investing in clean energy funds through a \nrequest  for  proposals  (paras.  10\u201312).    The  lesson  drawn  from  these  experiences  was  that  it \ntakes time and effort to incubate first-time emerging markets funds in a challenging fund-raising \nenvironment. This incubating role is appropriate in particular circumstances, such as when ADB \nwants to help develop a new asset class (or sector within the asset class) where few managers \nexist  and  so  there  is  not  the  luxury  of  choice  among  established  managers  (as  was  the  case \nwith  the  2007  request  for  proposals  for  clean  energy  funds).  However,  where  the  asset  class \ndoes exist and there are experienced managers in the market, ADB should focus on selecting \nthose fund managers  that  have the  highest  likelihood  of fund-raising  and  deployment  success \nbut  which  may  fall  short  without  ADB.  This  is  the  case  for  clean  energy  funds  today;  the \ndevelopment  of this  asset  class  was aided  in  part  by  ADB\u2019s  institutional efforts to  develop  the \nclean energy sector across Asia and the Pacific. ADB\u2019s leadership in promoting this new asset \nclass  (i.e.,  clean  energy  funds)  has  been  well  received  in  the  market,  and  market  participants \narticulate  the  desire  for  ADB  to  continue  taking  a  leadership  role  in  the  clean  energy  private \nequity industry in emerging Asian markets.     \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\nC. \n\n1.  Outputs and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe  key  output  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  the  establishment  of  the  funds  and  their \npolicies.

CLSACP  is  a \nwholly owned subsidiary of the CLSA Group, an independent brokerage and investment group \nthat  has  been  operating  in  Asia  since  1986.  CLSACP  has  in  excess  of  $2.7  billion  of  assets \nunder management across ten funds. The CRAG Fund is part of CLSACP\u2019s Clean Resources \nCapital  (CRC)  platform, which  also includes four  public  equity funds,  all of  which focus  on the \nshared theme of \u2015clean and green\u2016 investing. The CRAG Fund is a Cayman Islands exempted \nlimited partnership.   \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\na. \n\nManagement  \n\n22. \nGeneral  partner.  The  general  partner  of  the  fund  is  CLSA  Clean  Resources  Asia \nGrowth Management Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, which is wholly owned by \nCLSA  and  will  be  responsible  for  all  investment  and  disposition  decisions  on  behalf  of  the \nCRAG Fund. \n  \n23. \nAlthough  this  is  a  first-time  fund  team,  its  skill  set\u2014which  combines  clean  energy  and \nenvironment  project  development,  corporate  finance,  operations,  and  equity  (including  private \nequity) transactional experience\u2014is an appropriate combination of talents for the needs of the \nfund. Additionally, beyond the staff working directly on the fund team, the fund\u2019s operations will \nreceive  support  through  CLSACP\u2019s  institutional  experience  and  its  lessons  learned  from \ninvesting in private equity in Asia over the past dozen years, as well as through other specific \nindividuals  within  CLSACP  and  throughout  CLSA,  including  support  functions.  The  fund\u2019s \ninvestment  committee  will  also  represent  an  important  contribution  to  the  human  resource \ncapacity of the fund. \n \n\nb. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\nThe CRAG Fund will have an advisory board consisting of representatives of the limited \n\n24. \npartners, including ADB.  \n \n\nc. \n\nRisk Management  \n\nThe  general  partner  will  manage  risk  through  its  investment  process,  which  involves \n25. \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed  of \nmembers with extensive experience in clean energy and investment management.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n3. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nInvestment Objectives \n\n \n\n26. \nThe  CRAG  Fund  seeks to  leverage  the  domain knowledge  and industry contacts  of  its \nsponsor\u2019s clean technology platform. The CRAG Fund will capitalize on its management team\u2019s \nUnited  States  and  Asian  clean technology  experience  and  global  network  of  clean  technology \ninvestors to identify and invest in (i) proven clean technologies for application in Asian markets, \n(ii)  critical  elements  of  the  Asia-based  supply  chain  for  clean  resource  technologies,  and  (iii) \nhigh-growth clean technology companies engaged in expanding sales volumes and production \ncapacities.   \n \n\nb. \n\nInvestment Strategy \n\n \n27. \nThe  CRAG  Fund  intends  to  invest  primarily  in  operating  businesses  within  the  global \nclean  technology  sector  at  the  growth  or  expansion  stage  of  development  that  have  revenues \nand operations in Asian markets.  \n \nB. \n\nRenewable Energy Asia Fund \n\n1. \n\nSponsor and Ownership \n\n28. \nThe REA Fund will be a limited partnership registered in England pursuant to the Limited \nPartnerships  Act  1907.  The  general  partner  will  be  REAF  General  Partner,  a  Scottish  limited \npartnership. The fund will be managed by Berkeley Energy, a first-time fund manager set up in \n2007  to  establish  and  manage  the  REA  Fund.  The  REA  Fund  seeks  to  invest  in  renewable \nenergy infrastructure projects in Asia, with a focus on India, the Philippines, and other countries \nin Southeast Asia. The management team is based in London and Manila, and is in the process \nof setting up an office in India. The REA Fund will be owned by its investors. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\na. \n\nManagement  \n\n29. \nThe  REA  Fund  will  be  managed  by  the  team  of  Berkeley  Energy,  an  English  limited \nliability  partnership.    Although  this  is  a  first-time  fund  management  team,  its  skill  set,  which \ncombines  project  development,  corporate  finance,  operations,  and  equity  transactional \nexperience, is an appropriate combination of talents for the needs of the REA Fund.  \n \n\nb. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\nThe REA Fund will have a strategic advisory board and an investor advisory committee \n30. \ncomprised of representatives of the REA Fund limited partners selected by the general partner \n(and will include ADB).   \n \n\nc. \n\nRisk Management  \n\n31. \nThe REA Fund manager will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed  of \nmembers with extensive experience in clean energy and investment management.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n3. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\na. \n\nInvestment Objectives and Policies \n\n \n\n \n32. \nThe  REA  Fund  will  invest  into  post-permitting  renewable  energy  projects  and  project \ndevelopers using proven technologies in, primarily, India and the Philippines, generating project \nrevenue through green electricity, carbon credits, and/or energy by-products.   \n \n\nb.   \n\nInvestment Strategy \n\n \n33. \nOver  the  course  of  its  5-year  investment  period,  the  REA  Fund\u2019s  strategy  will  be  to \nmature and consolidate investments into operating portfolios. The REA Fund will seek to make \ninvestments in renewable energy projects and project developers in India, the Philippines, and \nother  DMCs.  Targeted  renewable  technologies  will  be  wind,  small  hydro,  and  other  proven \ntechnologies, in projects that are in the post-permitting stage.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n\n34. \nADB proposes to make equity investments of up to $20 million in each fund, or 25% of \nthe  total  commitments  in  respect  of  each  fund,  whichever  is  less.  ADB  will  not  be  the  single \nlargest investor in either fund.  \n \n35. \nmillion.   \n \nB. \n\nThe targeted CRAG Fund size is $200 million, and the targeted REA Fund size is \u20ac150 \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThere are a number of justifications for ADB\u2019s support of these investments. First, ADB \n36. \nwill  have  a  catalytic  role  in  the  fund-raising  being  undertaken  by  the  funds.  Even  though  the \nfunds have already achieved first closings, ADB's participation will help them achieve the target \nfund  size,  and  will  assist  in  raising  funds  from  potential  investors  that  gain  confidence  from \nADB's decision. This will help to develop the capital markets in the region by filling the gap that \ncurrently exists with regard to capital for clean energy projects.  \n \n37. \nAnother  important  value  addition  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  funds  arises  from  the \nrequirement that sustainable development issues and concerns are addressed in every investee \nproject  of  the  funds.  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  and  procedures  will \nhelp to guide the funds at every step in ensuring the sustainability of their future clean energy \nprojects. This is an important value addition, since the funds\u2019 target countries frequently possess \nfragile and exploited environments as a result of prior uncontrolled industrial activity, as well as \nthe  possible  existence  of  vulnerable  communities  including  indigenous  groups  or  ethnic \nminorities  who  may  be  adversely  affected,  and  to  which  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard  policies  and \nprocedures may apply.  \n \n38. \nLastly,  it  is  also  hoped,  given  the  significant  need  for  private  investments  in  the  clean \nenergy sectors of the funds' target countries, that ADB\u2019s intervention through the funds will help \nmobilize  capital  to  support  other  private  equity  funds  to  pursue  this  path.  This  demonstration \neffect  will  help  to  develop  a  class  of  new  fund  managers  and  financial  professionals  in  the \nsustainability sectors in the target regions. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\nA. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n39. \nADB\u2019s investment in the funds is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  funds  will  each  be  required  to  establish  and  implement  an  appropriate \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  to  ensure  that  its  investee  companies \nmeet  national  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  in  the  countries  in  which  these  companies  are \nlocated.  ADB  will  coordinate  with  the  respective  fund  managers  to  ensure  that  the  ESMS  is \nadopted  before  disbursement  for  the  first  investment,  and  guide  the  fund  managers  in \nenvironmental and social safeguards due diligence, monitoring, and reporting.   \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n40. \nThe fund managers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB will require the funds\u2019 general partners, managers, and sponsors to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and the funds will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\n41. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance  to  the  REA  Fund.9   Following  the  approval  of  the  proposed  investment  by  ADB's \nBoard  of  Directors,  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  documentation,  in  a  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investments  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ninvestment  of  up  to  $20,000,000  in  the  Clean  Resources  Asia  Growth  Fund  and  up  to \n$20,000,000  in  the  Renewable  Energy  Asia  Fund  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n\n4 November 2010\n\n                                                \n9   The Government of India\u2019s no objection will be sought for the REA Fund due to the high likelihood that investments \n\nfrom the REA Fund will be made in India subsequent to ADB\u2019s investment in the fund. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary
