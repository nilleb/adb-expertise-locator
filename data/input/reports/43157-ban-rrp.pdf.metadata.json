The  proposed  CSF  will  help  the \nGovernment implement its countercyclical development program.  \n \nSound economic management enabled Bangladesh to withstand major \nexternal  shocks  while  sustaining  its  growth  momentum.  The  economy \nwas  severely  tested  in  FY2008  when  it  experienced  repeated  floods \nand the catastrophic cyclone Sidr, with major loss of life and destruction \nof  property  and  crops;  and  the  external  shock  resulting  from  surging \npetroleum and other commodity prices.  \n \nAlthough  Bangladesh  reduced  poverty  significantly  between  1991  and \n2005,  the  country  still  remains  poor\u2014with  an  estimated  56  million \npeople or 40% of population in poverty in 2005. While Bangladesh is on \ntrack  to  achieve  the  2015  Millennium  Development  Goals  target  of \nreducing \ninequalities  widened \nespecially  in  the  1990s.  Progress  in  poverty  reduction  has  also  been \nhighly uneven across regions.  \n \nEven without the global economic crisis, the development challenges in \nremittances \nBangladesh  are  daunting.  Growth \ndecelerated  significantly  since  October\u2013December  2008  (the  second \nquarter of FY2009). The economic slowdown is also affecting revenue \n\nincome  poverty  by  half, \n\nin  exports  and \n\nincome \n\n \n\n\fii \n \n\nthe  Government's  commitment \n\nfor  Tk34.2  billion  ($495  million) \n\ncollection.  With  more  than  2.2  million  workers  directly  engaged  in  the \nready-made  garments  sector,  and  an  equal  number  of  workers \nemployed in ancillary activities, the slowdown in exports translates into \nwidespread poverty in both urban and rural areas. Further, slowdown in \nthe  growth  of  remittances  will  cause  hardship  for  recipient  households \nand deepen poverty. The decline in the number of workers leaving for \noverseas  jobs  will  also  create  pressure  on  the  already  slack  domestic \njob market. \n \nThe Government's development agenda, which pays particular attention \nto economic stability, elimination of poverty, energy security, combating \ncorruption,  and  good  governance,  reflects  its  concerns  about  the \neconomic  and  social  implications  of  the  crisis,  the  prevailing  high \npoverty  incidence,  and  the  effect  of  recent  natural  disasters.  The \nGovernment  established  a  task  force  to  monitor  national  and  global \nevents, and provide prompt advice to enable decisions for mitigating the \nimpact of the crisis. In April 2009, the Government announced a fiscal \nstimulus  package \nfor  exports, \nagriculture, power, and SSNPs.  \n \nto \nThe  FY2010  budget  affirms \nmaintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  undertaking  fundamental \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms  to  attain  pro-poor  inclusive  growth.  A \ncountercyclical  development  program  in  the  form  of  additional  fiscal \nexpenditures was announced in the FY2010 budget in June 2009. The \nGovernment's  countercyclical  development  program  has  four  broad \ncomponents:  (i)  a  fiscal  stimulus  package;  (ii)  an  expansion  of  the \nSSNPs; (iii) a substantial increase in the Annual Development Program; \nand (iv) introduction of a new public\u2013private partnership (PPP) scheme. \n \nThe Government is aware that putting the economy on a higher growth \ntrajectory,  and  achieving  rapid  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction  will \nrequire large-scale investments well beyond what the Government can \nprovide.  More  investment-enabling  policy  measures  will  clearly  be \nneeded  to  induce  large-scale  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  To \nensure timely implementation of development programs, the capacity of \nline  ministries  will  also  need  to  be  enhanced.  In  addition,  ensuring \ncontinued  flows  of  credit  to  the  private  sector,  and  strengthening  the \ncapital market, would help attract investors to close the investment gap. \nMore  support  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  the \nhousing sector would also contribute to making growth more inclusive.  \n \nIn  mitigating  the  adverse  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis,  the \nGovernment's  emphasis \nin  human \nis  on  protecting \ndevelopment through enhanced and effective spending on SSNPs. The \ncrisis  has  prompted  the  Government  to  undertake  policy  reforms  to \nensure  development  momentum  well  into  the  future  and  to  preempt \nhardships.  Accordingly,  support  to  the  Government  to  deal  with  the \nimpact  of  the  global  crisis,  while  also  helping  to  address  some \ninstitutional  limitations,  is  proposed  to  be  provided  through  the  PESF \nand  the  CSF.  The  objective  of  the  PESF  is  to  accelerate  reforms  that \n\ninvestments \n\n\fare  essential  for  higher  long-term  economic  growth,  while  also \nfor  social  protection.  The  CSF  will \nimproving  service  delivery \nsupplement \nthe \nGovernment's countercyclical development program.  \n \n\nthe  PESF  by  providing  support \n\nto  scale  up \n\nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the proposed PESF is to enhance pro-poor and gender-\ninclusive  growth  and  improve  living  standards  of  the  vulnerable \npopulations.  The  objective  of  the  proposed  PESF  is  to  support  the \nGovernment to better address the adverse impact on the economy from \nexternal  shocks  as  well  as  inherent  weaknesses  in  the  enabling \nenvironment for private sector development and social service delivery. \nThe  outcome  of  the  PESF  is  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment \nwhere  private  sector  development  is  emphasized  and  where  women \nand  vulnerable  populations  have  greater  access  to  social  services, \nincluding through effective gender targeting. \n \nThe proposed PESF will support the Government to put in place policy \nactions in three areas: (i) delivering services effectively\u2014by supporting \nthe  Government  in  undertaking  a  significant  scaling  up  of  SSNPs, \neffective  gender  targeting,  and  legal  measures  for  greater  say  in \nensuring quality and effectiveness of service delivery; (ii) developing a \nconducive  investment  climate\u2014by  strengthening  the  Government's \nability  to  attract  private  investment,  in  particular  through  PPPs,  in \nsectors critical to sustaining and accelerating economic growth; and (iii) \nstrengthening the public financial management system\u2014by helping the \nGovernment  to  increase  fiscal  space  through  enhanced  efficiency  and \nintegrity in public spending, and higher revenue generation. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  CSF  is  to  contribute  to  Government's \nefforts to achieve higher growth and improve living standards given the \ncountry's  exposure  to  external  shocks.  The  objective  of  the  proposed \nCSF \nits  countercyclical \ndevelopment  program  for  coping  with  the  effects  of  the  global  crisis. \nThe  outcome  of  the  proposed  CSF  is  macroeconomic  stability,  higher \npublic and private investment, and greater access to social services by \nwomen and vulnerable populations. \n \nA.  \n \n(i)     Two  loans  totaling  $144.85  million  equivalent  from  the  Special \nFunds  resources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB):  (a)  a \n\u201chard-term\u201d  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  of  $44.85 \nmillion equivalent, and (b) a \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $100 million \nequivalent.  The  ADF  loans  will  both  have  a  term  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; interest under the hard-term \nADF loan will be at 1.6% per annum for the life of the loan while \ninterest under the soft-term ADF loan will be at 1.0% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  Other \nterms  and  conditions  will  be  set  forth  in  the  related  draft  Loan \nAgreements. \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n \n\nThe proposed loans for the PESF are as follows: \n\nthe  Government \n\nimplement \n\nto  help \n\nis \n\n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nProgram  Period  and \nTranching \n\n \n(ii)     A  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year \nterm  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such \nother \nthe  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n\nterms  and  conditions  set \n\nforth \n\nin \n\n \nB.     For the CSF, the proposed loan is as follows: \n \nA loan of $500 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources. The loan \nwill have a 5-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an annual \ninterest  rate  equal  to  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  plus  2.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  \n \nThe implementation period for the PESF and the CSF is from October \n2009  to  December  2010.  All  policy  actions  and  disbursements  under \nthe  PESF  will  be  implemented  within  this  period.  The  PESF  loans  are \nproposed  to  be  released  in  two  tranches,  subject  to  the  Government \nmeeting  the  conditions  for  release  of  the  tranches.  The  CSF  will  be \ndisbursed in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nCounterpart Funding  The local currency generated from the proceeds of the PESF loans will \nbe  used  to  finance  adjustment  costs  under  the  PESF,  including  (i) \nscaling  up  of  SSNPs,  (ii)  mainstreaming  PPPs  and  supporting  SMEs, \nand  (iii)  enhancing  public  financial  management.  The  local  currency \ngenerated from the proceeds of the CSF loan will support SSNPs.  \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) \n \nThe  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the \nfacilitating \nPESF, \nadministration,  disbursements,  and  maintenance  of  records.  A  joint \nsecretary of the Finance Division, MOF, will act as the program director. \nThe  implementing  agencies  for  the  PESF  will  consist  of  the  relevant \nreport  and \nministries  and  agencies,  as  described \nrecommendation  of  the  President.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be \nresponsible  for  meeting  the  policy  actions  under  their  respective \njurisdictions.  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established \nand  will  be responsible for  overall  direction,  guidance,  monitoring,  and \noversight.  Its  members  will  include  representatives  not  below  the  rank \nof  joint  secretary  from  all  the  relevant  implementing  agencies  and  the \nEconomic Relations Division. The finance secretary will chair the PSC. \nThe  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  discuss  the  progress  of  the \nfacility  and  review  macroeconomic  conditions  to  ensure  continued \nstability.  \n\nincluding  compliance  with  all  policy  actions, \n\nthis \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  the  CSF  will  be  the  same  as \nthose for the PESF, with the MOF acting as the executing agency. The \nimplementing  agencies\u2014the  same  as  those  for  the  PESF\u2014will  be \nmaintained for monitoring purposes. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  Government \nwill  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures \nwill  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds and verify the Government's certification. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nScaled up SSNPs will help to cushion the impact of the crisis; improve \nhousehold well-being; and help reduce poverty through better nutrition, \neducation,  and  improved  opportunities  to  participate  in  the  economy. \nIncreased spending on SMEs, housing, and infrastructure will promote \nhigher long-term growth, create jobs, and raise incomes. Other benefits \ninclude: \n \n(i)  \n\nAs a result of reforms supported by the PESF, the poor will be \nempowered  to  claim  and  receive  the  benefits  they  are  entitled \nto  because  of  enhanced  access  to  information  and  oversight. \nThe  Employment  Generation  Program  for  the  Hardcore  Poor \nwill help improve economic opportunities.  \n\n \n(ii)  \n\n \n(iii)  \n\n \n(iv)  \n\nThe  PESF  and  CSF  will  provide  additional  resources  to  help \nexpand  SSNPs  to  also  cover  people  who  previously  were  not \npoor but who are hurt by the crisis, such as households highly \ndependent  on  remittances,  laid  off  expatriate  and  factory \nworkers  in  affected  export  sectors,  women  forced  into  low-\npaying  and  insecure  jobs,  and  the  large  number  of  young \npeople  joining  the  labor  market  at  a  time  of  shrinking  job \nopportunities.  \n\nThe  PESF  and  CSF  will  create  fiscal  space  to  enable  the \nGovernment to finance scaled up infrastructure investment and \nfiscal  stimulus  spending.  These  additional  expenditures  will \nhelp  reduce  the  risk  of  unemployment  and  income  loss  in  the \nimmediate term, and also enhance long-term growth prospects \nwithout compromising macroeconomic stability or crowding out \nprivate investment.  \n\nSuccessful  PPPs  in  infrastructure  and  social  sectors  over  the \nmedium-  to  long-term  will  enable  higher  investment  in  social \nexpenditures  and  broaden  management \nfor \ninfrastructure projects.  \n\ncapacity \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and \nMitigations \n\nvi \n \n\n \n \n\n(v)  \n\n \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\nThe results from performance monitoring and reporting systems \nwill  feed  into  the  planning  and  budgeting  process  to  ensure \naccountability  on  public  spending  and  to  control  irregularities. \nEnhanced internal and external control measures and oversight \nwill  have  been  put  in  place  to  reduce  the  opportunities  for \ncorruption.  \n\nA  prolonged  economic  downturn  would  likely  result  in  lower \nfiscal  revenue  and  accentuate  the  risk  of  the  budget  deficit \nexceeding 5% of gross domestic product. This would lead to a \ncorrespondingly  higher  government  borrowing  requirement, \nwhich would be inflationary and seriously limit the availability of \ncredit  to  the  private  sector.  The  countercyclical  measures  to \nsupport affected sectors and broaden access to credit for SMEs \nand  women  entrepreneurs  will  provide  some  relief  to  those \nmost likely to be affected.    \n \nA  further  decline  in  remittances  would  have  a  negative  impact \non  the  livelihood  of  many  rural  households  heavily  dependent \non such income. SSNPs targeting people with low income and \nno assets will mitigate this risk.  \n \nLeakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption  could  reduce  the \neffectiveness  of  expenditures.  However,  actions  taken  under \nthe  PESF  to  enhance  access  to  information  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups and to strengthen oversight will help mitigate \nsuch concerns.  \n \nto  constrain \nLimited  absorption  capacity  could  continue \nimplementation  of  development  projects.

The higher allocation \nin  the  FY2010  budget  for  the  Fund  for  Climate  Change  and \nfiscal space created through the PESF and CSF would facilitate \nGovernment's response to such events.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  (i)  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF) \nProgram  and  (ii)  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  Support  Program. 1 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the PESF is in Appendix 1 and for the CSF in Appendix 2.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Performance  \n\n2.  \nThe  effect  of  the  global  economic  crisis  (global  crisis  or  crisis)  on  the  Bangladesh \neconomy  is  significant.  While  limited  exposure  to  the  global  financial  system  kept  Bangladesh \nlargely  untouched  by  the  first-round  effects  of  the  crisis,  the  country  started  experiencing \nsignificant  deceleration  in  growth  of  exports  and  remittances  from  the  second  quarter  of  FY \n2009 (i.e., October\u2013December 2008). Since October 2008, the second round effects (slowdown \nin  exports  and  remittances  spreading  to  the  broader  economy)  of  the  crisis  have  adversely \nimpacted the real economy, as the global crisis transformed into a global recession. Growth in \nexports  during  FY2009  declined  to  10.1%  from  17.4%  in  FY2008.  On  a  year-on-year  basis, \nexports declined by 2.3% in April 2009, grew by only 4.3% in May, but declined again by 3% in \nJune  2009  and  a  further  6.8%  in  July  2009.  Growth  in  remittances,  a  key  driver  of  growth  in \nBangladesh, started falling on a year-on-year basis from October 2008 (16% in that month) after \ngrowing  at  a  monthly  average  of  43.5%  during  July-September  2008.  Growth  in  remittances \ndropped  to  only  10.1%  during  February-April  2009,  and  after  a  brief  spike  in  May\u2013June  2008, \nfell  to  8%  in  July  2009.  The  global  economic  slowdown  is  seriously  affecting  revenue \ncollection\u23aftax revenues in FY2009 (accounting for around 80% of total revenues) grew by only \n10.7%, down from 27.3% in FY2008.  \n \n3. \nPrudent  macroeconomic  management  in  Bangladesh  had  contributed  to  achieving \nrobust economic growth while maintaining internal and external balances until the onset of the \ncrisis  (Table  1).  These  results  were  achieved  in  the  face  of  repeated  natural  disasters.  Fiscal \ndeficits  remained  less  than  4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  FY2003\u2013FY2007. \nRobust  growth  in  exports  and  remittances  underpinned  steady  current  account  surpluses \nbetween  FY2002  and  the  early  part  of  FY2009  (except  in  FY2005)  and  contributed  to  healthy \nforeign  reserves.  Inflation  remained  below  7%  between  FY2002  and  FY2005,  and  slightly \nexceeded 7% in FY2006\u2013FY2007. Because of the effects of the natural disasters and the rise in \nfood and commodity prices in 2008, inflation shot up to 9.9% in 2008 and the fiscal deficit rose \nto 4.7% of GDP as a result of larger budgetary allocations needed to alleviate the effect on the \n\n                                                 \n1  The PESF is the outcome of policy dialogue with the Government of Bangladesh to address critical constraints to \neconomic growth, social development, and good governance. Realizing the challenges in fulfilling its development \nagenda especially during the global economic crisis, the Government agreed to accelerate critical reforms that are \nbeing supported by the PESF. Building on the PESF reforms, the CSF supports social safety net measures under \nthe Government's countercyclical development program.  \n\n2  The PESF follows the standard program loan format and the CSF is in accordance with guidelines for implementing \nthe CSF (ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB's Response to the Global Economic Crisis\u2013Establishing the Countercyclical \nSupport Facility. Manila). Processing of the PESF as a program loan with two management review meetings also \nenabled a detailed review of the Government's countercyclical development program to be supported by the CSF. \nWhile  the  core  aspects  of  the  PESF  and  the  CSF  have  been  discussed  separately  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation  of  the  President  (including  the  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  and  the  development  policy \nletters), the sections such as on implementation, special features, benefits and impact have been presented jointly, \nreflecting their complementarity. In this report, the term \"Program\" refers to the PESF and the CSF jointly.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\npoor.  In  FY2009,  the  inflation  rate  declined  to  6.7%  and  the  fiscal  deficit  is  estimated  to  have \ndeclined to a little over 4%.  \n \n\nTable 1: Bangladesh \u2013 Selected Economic Indicators \n\nItem \nA.

Although  agriculture  has  recovered,  underpinned  by  favorable \nweather conditions and strong public policy support, and will be an important rebalancing factor, \nslower  growth  of  exports  and  remittances  had  knock-on  effects  on  industry  and  services  in \nFY2009  that  will  continue  into  FY2010,  through  weaker  external  and  domestic  demand.  The \nservices  sector  will  moderate  due  to  the  slowdown  in  industrial  activities  and  trade  as  well  as \nweaker private consumption due to the slowdown in remittance inflows. The growth of GDP is \nexpected to be lower in FY2010 also on the basis of the lower growth  in industrial term loans \nand sharp decline in the opening of letters of credit for capital machinery.  \n\n                                                 \n3   Government  of  Bangladesh.  2005.  Unlocking  the  Potential:  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction. \n\nDhaka. \n\n\f5. \nAlthough  Bangladesh  made  significant  progress  in  poverty  reduction  between  FY1991 \nand FY2005,4 the country still remains poor\u2014with an estimated 56 million people in poverty in \n2005. While Bangladesh is on track to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ntarget  of  reducing  income  poverty  by  half,  and  has  made  progress  in  other  indicators  of  well-\nbeing (such as for infant and child mortality, and has met the target for gender parity in primary \nand  secondary  schooling),  income  inequalities  widened  especially  in  the  1990s.  In  terms  of \ncalorie intake, although the incidence of poverty has declined in rural areas, it has increased in \nurban areas. Progress in poverty reduction has also been highly uneven across regions.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\nThe global economic crisis began to have an impact on Bangladesh during the second \n6. \nquarter  of  FY2009,  which  coincided  with  the  transition  from  a  caretaker  government  to  a \ndemocratically  elected  one.  This  transition  also  coincided  with  a  general  perception  that \nBangladesh  may  largely  remain  immune  to  the  global  crisis  given  its  strong  macroeconomic \nperformance  and  limited  exposure  to  financial  contagion.  However,  as  soon  as  the  current \nGovernment  assumed  office  in  January  2009,  the  second  round  impact  of  the  crisis  became \napparent.  The  Government  promptly  established  a  task  force  to  develop  a  comprehensive \ninformation center, continually monitor national and global events, and provide prompt advice to \nhelp  make  the  decisions  needed  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  crisis.  The  Government's  first \nresponse  to  the  crisis, announced  in  April  2009  (para.  74), was  a  Tk34.2  billion  ($495  million) \nstimulus package for exports, agriculture, power, and social safety net programs (SSNPs).5   \n \nCognizant  of  the  economic  and  social  implications  of  the  crisis  and  the  prevailing  high \n7. \npoverty incidence, the election manifesto6 of the Government in late 2008 had already outlined \nan  ambitious  development  agenda  with  particular  attention \ninclusive  growth.  The \ndevelopment strategy in the manifesto covers five key issues: (i) economic stability and control \nover  commodity  price  hike,  (ii)  elimination  of  poverty  and  inequity,  (iii)  energy  security,  (iv) \nanticorruption,  and  (v)  good  governance.  To  align  with  these  priorities,  the  Government  is \nrevising  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  (NSAPR-II)7 prepared  by  the \ncaretaker  government  in  October  2008.  No  major  overhaul  is  envisaged  since  the  NSAPR-II \nalso  stresses  strengthening  SSNPs,  creating  job  opportunities,  ensuring  regional  balance  in \ndevelopment, and facilitating decentralized growth. The emphasis in the NSAPR-II on improving \ngovernance, controlling population growth, strengthening focus on women's advancement, and \nensuring environmental protection is also in line with Government priorities. \n \n8. \nIn its first budget (for FY2010) in June 2009, the Government provided its medium-term \ndevelopment  agenda.  The  FY2010  budget  attaches  high  priority  to  infrastructure,  human \nresource  development,  and  capacity  building.  It  seeks  to  raise  the  level  of  investments  by \nmobilizing  more  resources,  with  a  major  thrust  on  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs),  and \nsimplifying  investment-related  laws  and  regulations.  Expansion  of  SSNPs,  ensuring  food \nsecurity  and  addressing  the  effects  of  climate  change  are  prominent  features  of  the  FY2010 \nbudget.  Based  on  the  task  force  recommendations,  the  Government\u2019s  April  2009  stimulus \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4  The latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey was conducted in 2005. During 1991\u20132005, the compound \npoverty reduction rate per year is recorded at 1.3% although the rate of reduction in urban areas is faster than that \nin rural areas. During the period 2000\u20132005, income poverty was reduced from 48.9% to 40% (1.8% annually).  \n5   SSNPs  collectively  refer  to  Government  programs  to  support    those  who  are    geographically,  socially,    and \n\nseasonally vulnerable (see paras. 13 and 14, and Appendix 3 for details).  \n\n6   Government  of  Bangladesh.  2008.

Moving Ahead (National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II). Dhaka.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\npackage (paras. 6 and 74) was further expanded in the FY2010 budget to give impetus (paras. \n75-77) to exports, infrastructure investments, and scaling up of SSNPs.  \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  in  FY2010,  it  will  face  constraints  in  implementing  its \n9. \nessential  spending  programs  in  the  social  sectors  as  well  as  infrastructure  investments\u2014the \nsituation will be compounded by the likely weaker revenue collection. Lower revenues will also \nmake  it  difficult  for  the  Government  to  mobilize  required  counterpart  funds  for  donor-funded \nprojects. The global economic slowdown may also affect the flow of external aid, especially from \nbilateral  sources.  The  Government  is  concerned  that  the  current  global  crisis  will  also  have \nadverse effects on its efforts to reduce poverty if there is reduced economic growth, job losses, \nand shrinking job opportunities. To mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis on the poor, \nthe  Government  is  willing  to  undertake  long-term  policy  reforms  so  as  not  to  disrupt \ndevelopment  momentum  and  at  the  same  time  scale  up  SSNPs  and  expand  essential \ninfrastructure  in  the  event  of  pronounced  growth  slowdown.  In  this  context,  the  Government \nrequested  ADB  to  help  prioritize  and  sequence  the  reforms  in  the  overall  context  of  its \ndevelopment agenda (para. 8), help catalyze recovery and long-term inclusive growth, and also \nsupport its countercyclical development program.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS FOR THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY \n\nPROGRAM  \n\nA. \n\nProblems and Opportunities8 \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\nfar-reaching  policy  and \n\ninstitutional  reforms  and  substantial \n\nUnleashing  Bangladesh's  development  potential  is  a  long  and  complex  process,  which \n10. \nrequires \nin \ninfrastructure  and  human  development.  At  the  same  time,  protecting  the  poor  and  the \nvulnerable  sections9 of  society  is  particularly  important  in  view  of  the  country's  high  poverty \nincidence and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters. The global crisis has accentuated these \nvulnerabilities. While inclusive growth would enable the poor to contribute to, and benefit from, \neconomic recovery and future growth, Bangladesh has been slow to realize this potential due to \ndeficiencies in, among others, social protection and social service delivery, investment policies, \nand public financial management (Appendix 3).10  \n \n\ninvestments \n\na. \n\nSocial Protection and Social Service Delivery \n\n11. \nNotwithstanding the substantial gains in poverty reduction, progress in reducing poverty \nhas  been  uneven  across  regions.  The  largest  decline  in  poverty  incidence  occurred  in  the \neastern  part  of  the  country  but  the  poverty  headcount  ratio  stagnated  or  rose  slightly  in  the \nwestern  region,  where  half  of  the  population  remains  poor.  In  rural  areas,  earnings  are \nconstrained by low rates of return from agricultural and few nonfarm employment opportunities. \n\n                                                 \n8  The Problems and Constraints Analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A and Poverty Analysis is in Supplementary \n\nAppendix C. \n\n9  The groups particularly vulnerable to risks include: (i) infants and children that face the risk of poverty, malnutrition, \nlow  human  capital  accumulation,  and  exploitation  in  the  labor  force;  (ii)  working  age  adults  that  face  the  risk  of \nunemployment  and  low  productivity;  (iii)  elderly  adults  that  lack  adequate  safety  nets;  (iv)  special  and  excluded \ngroups  that  need  assistance;  and  (v)  a  majority  of  women  who  have  very  limited  access  to  empowerment  and \nproductive employment opportunities. \n\n10 For  the  purposes  of  the  PESF,  the  term  sector  refers  to  (i)  service  delivery  in  the  domain  of  SSNPs;  (ii)  public \nfinancial  management,  particularly,  public  expenditure  management,  public  sector  efficiency  and  revenue \nmobilization, and financial and fiscal management; and (iii) private sector development especially through PPPs.  \n\n\fLandless  seasonal  workers  face  a  yearly  threat  of  survival  during  the  monsoon.  Moreover, \nfrequent  natural  disasters  cause  severe  losses  in  terms  of  life  and  property  damage.  Most \nrecently,  cyclone  Aila  hit  the  coastal  areas  of  the  southwest  region  of  the  country  causing \ndamage  to  life  and  property.11 As  the  poor  live  in,  and  depend  disproportionately  on,  marginal \nlands, including coastal belts, they are the most vulnerable to natural disasters. These disasters \nalso impose a huge budgetary burden on the Government through higher allocations for relief \nand reconstruction as well as tax its implementation capacity.  \n \n12.  Women are more vulnerable to poverty in Bangladesh because of their limited access to \neconomic  resources,  their  lower  level  of  education,12 and  their  extremely  low  participation  in \nwage work or self-employment opportunities in nonfarm activities. Women comprise the majority \nof  the  export  manufacturing  workforce,  but  concentrate  mostly  in  insecure  jobs  with  low \nearnings. The current global crisis could throw a large number of women out of work, especially \nin the ready-made garments industry that employs 2.2 million workers, mostly women, or push \nthem into insecure jobs. Reduction in remittances could severely affect household food security, \nespecially as many families are still battered by the impact of the food crisis in 2008. Returning \nmigrant  workers  could  put  more  pressure  on  the  already  limited  land  resources  and  rural \nnonfarm employment opportunities.  \n \nThe  Government  provides  extensive  SSNPs  to  support  those  who  are  geographically, \n13. \nsocially, and seasonally vulnerable (Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix B). Up to FY2009, \nthere were 57 SSNPs, and SSNP-related expenditure amounted to 2.3% of GDP. These SSNPs \ninclude:  (i)  special  allowances  and  cash  transfers  for  different  underprivileged  sections  of  the \npopulation;  (ii)  food  security-based  activities;  (iii)  employment  generation  for  poverty  reduction \nthrough  microcredit  programs;  and  (iv)  education,  health,  training,  and  technical  assistance  to \nmake the new generation more self-reliant. Nearly 72 million beneficiaries accessed the SSNPs \nduring FY2009 (although this number includes those that accessed more than one SSNP). \n \n14. \nIt  is  widely  recognized  that  SSNPs  have  played  a  major  role  in  helping  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  to  improve  their  livelihoods,  and  health  and  nutrition  status,  as  well  as  protecting \nthem  from  the  impact  of  a  worsening  environment.  Nearly  half  of  the  SSNP  beneficiaries  are \nwomen.  Yet,  the  SSNPs  face  considerable  challenges  because  of  insufficient  targeting  and \ninefficiencies in service delivery (para.79). Weak implementation capacity of local governments \nand  agencies  and  low  oversight  of  project  execution  are  additional  issues.  Despite  efforts  by \nsuccessive  governments,  service  delivery  mechanisms  in  the  public  sector  have  remained \nweak.  The  main  constraints  to  developing  an  effective  service  delivery  system  are  lack  of \ntransparency  and  the  absence  of  a  legal  framework  to  enable  the  citizens  to  have  access  to \ninformation to empower them to demand protection from abuses. In addition, as consumers, the \npeople in general, and the poor in particular, have little, if any, legal protection on the quality of \ngoods and services.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 Cyclone Aila, in May 2009, left more than 200 people dead and set the economy back considerably, while cyclone \nSidr, in November 2007, left a death toll of almost 4,000 people and an economic loss of approximately $1.4 billion \n(approximately 2% of GDP). Economic costs of natural disasters are also felt hard by small businesses situated in \nthe coastal areas. In the seven Upazilas (sub-districts) of Cox's Bazar district alone, cyclone Aila caused damage \nto the fish and shrimp industry of approximately $6 million (Source: Star Business. 2009).  \n\n12 This  is  despite  Bangladesh  having  already  met  the  MDG  targets  for  gender  parity  in  primary  and  secondary \n\nschooling. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nb. \n\nInvestment Climate  \n\n15.  With  scarce  public  resources,  it  is  imperative  for  Bangladesh  to  attract  private  sector \ninvestment  for  enhanced  efficiency  and  productivity.  However,  inadequate  infrastructure,  low \nskill  level  of  laborers,  scarcity  of  skilled  mid-level  and  senior  managers,  unstable  regulatory \nenvironment,  and  a  weak  contract  enforcement  system  all  work  against  the  private  sector  as \nwell  as  foreign  direct  investment  in  Bangladesh.  While  the  oil,  gas,  and  telecommunications \nsectors  have  attracted  foreign  direct  investment  in  recent  years,  projects  are  still  delayed  by \nlong approval times. Overall, doing business remains difficult in Bangladesh, which was ranked \n110 out of 181 countries in 2009 in terms of ease in doing business.13  \n\n \nSustained  growth  with  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh  cannot  be  attained  without \n16. \nsubstantial  investments  in  infrastructure.  Although  infrastructure  is  a  critical  feature  of  a \ncountry's investment climate, under-investment over the years has resulted in acute deficiencies \nin  the  availability  of  infrastructure,  especially  in  power  and  energy,  ports,  and  roads,  which \nrestrict  business  opportunities  and  access  to  public  services.  Erratic  and  insufficient  power \nsupply is estimated to cost Bangladesh some 2% of GDP growth every year. The situation for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is even worse, as they cannot afford generators of \ntheir own.  \n \n17.  Mobilizing  finance  for  private  investment  in  infrastructure  is  a  major  challenge  in  the \nabsence  of  a  well-developed  domestic  capital  market  and  a  lack  of  appetite  of  foreign  private \ninvestors  for  investment  in  infrastructure.  Attempts  to  attract  the  private  sector  under  PPP \nschemes  have  had  only  limited  success,  in  part  due  to  inadequate  (i)  project  development \nefforts  and  skills,  (ii)  coordination  mechanisms  and  leadership,  and  (iii)  clarity  on  the  legal \nframework for PPPs. Even though the Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG) issued in \n2004 are currently the basis for implementation of PPP projects, there is a lack of clarity on the \nthe  Public  Procurement  Regulations  and  private  sector  project \nconsistency  between \ndevelopment, approval, and financing provisions under the jurisdiction of PSIG.   \n \n18.  While significant financial sector reform14 initiatives are underway, market gaps remain. \nCredit for SMEs and the rural nonfarm sector remains inadequate notwithstanding their critical \nrole in poverty reduction through employment generation in rural nonfarm activities. Specialized \nfinancial institutions like Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha have a \npoor  record  of  lending  to  SMEs.  The  limited  capacity  of  the  credit  information  bureau  at \nBangladesh  Bank  (the  central  bank)  has  impeded  access  to  reliable  information  on  potential \nclients. Notwithstanding the major ongoing capital market development efforts, the market is not \ndeep enough for mobilizing resources to support private sector activity and promote economic \ngrowth in a substantial manner. \n \n\n                                                 \n13 In  a  related  indicator  of  doing  business,  typical  property  registration  procedures  take  around  245  days  to  be \ncompleted, while the same procedures take only 5 days in Nepal, 45 days in India, and 50 days in Pakistan.

Doing Business 2009, World Bank 2009. http://www.doingbusiness.org/; \nInternational Finance Corporation. 2009. http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/  \n\n14 Reforms supported by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and ADB in the financial sector focus on \n(i) greater autonomy for Bangladesh Bank (the central bank), (ii) strengthening Bangladesh Bank\u2019s capabilities to \nperform  its  enhanced  responsibilities,  (iii)  strengthening  prudential  regulations  and  supervision,  (iv)  restructuring \nthe  management  and  internal  processes  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  ultimately  privatization,  (v) \nstrengthening legal and judicial processes, and (vi) improving money and debt markets.  \n\n\fc. \n\nPublic Financial Management15 \n\n19. \nAlthough Bangladesh has carried out fiscal reforms with some success in recent years, \nrevenues  have  remained  low  because  of  a  narrow  tax  base,  extensive  use  of  ad-hoc \nexemptions and exclusions, and excessively complex tax rules and administrative procedures, \nas well as weak tax administration, which have encouraged pervasive tax evasion. Outdated tax \nlaws and regulations have further complicated enforcement of fiscal discipline. Government tax \nrevenue  collection  at  9.0%  of  GDP  is  low  by  international  standards  reflecting  weaknesses  in \nthe  public  resource  management  system.  Low  revenues  have  constrained  essential  public \nexpenditure, resulting in a level of public expenditure (15.3% of GDP in FY2009) that is low by \ninternational standards.  \n \n20. \nThe public financial management (PFM) system has remained weak because of rigidities \nconstraining  line  ministry  spending,  poor  monitoring,  low  budget  allocation  for  operation  and \nmaintenance, inconsistency between sector allocations and development priorities, and lack of \nfrom  recurrent \na  unified  budget  preparation  system \nexpenditures.  Weak  management  capacity,  and  insufficient  transparency  and  accountability, \nhave  hampered  the  efficiency  of  public  spending  despite  the  introduction  of  the  Medium-Term \nBudgetary Framework (MTBF) in 2005 to strengthen the links between planning and budgeting \nas well as between resource allocation and performance. The Government has been unable to \nscale up public infrastructure spending. While the budget allocation for the Annual Development \nProgram16 (ADP) has remained broadly steady, actual spending has declined from 5.0% of GDP \nin  FY2005  to  3.2%  in  FY2009,  mainly  because  of  poor  planning  and  weak  implementation \ncapacity  (para.  80)  in  government  agencies.  In  addition,  prioritization  of  spending  has  been \ninsufficient; transfers and subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises still absorb a large \nshare of resources.  \n \nPublic expenditures at lower levels of Government and state-owned enterprises are still \n21. \nnot systematically consolidated in the fiscal accounts and reporting framework, making it difficult \nto assess and improve the use of public resources. The audit function remains weak with little \nfocus  on  outcomes  and  performance  of  the  programs,  resulting  in  little  impact  on  financial \naccountability. Both the annual accounts and audit reports are issued with a considerable time \nlag (more than 12 months from the end of the fiscal year).  \n \n\nthat  clearly  distinguishes  capital \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities  \n\na. \n\nEnhancing Service Delivery  \n\n22. \nIn  the  context  of  the  global  crisis,  and  in  response  to  recent  natural  disasters  (most \nrecently,  cyclone  Aila),  the  Government  has  taken  a  conscious  policy  decision  to  scale  up \nSSNPs  to  prevent  large  segments  of  the  population  from  sliding  deeper  into  poverty,  and  to \nprovide  relief  to  the  additional  non-poor  who  are  expected  to  fall  into  poverty.  Increasing  the \ncoverage and improving the quality and effectiveness of service delivery will be critical to ensure \nthat  expanded  SSNPs  achieve  the  desired  results.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  to \n\n                                                 \n15 As  used  in  this  document,  the  term  'public  financial  management'  refers  to  broader  perspectives  of  fiscal  and \n\nfinancial management.  \n\n16 The ADP is the annual budget for financing development investment projects in Bangladesh. As capital expenditure, \nADP  is  the  main  channel  for  public  investment  in  infrastructure.  Development  Partners  are  actively  involved  in \nhelping the Government prepare and implement ADP projects and provide substantial financing. The allocation for \nADP  in  the  FY2010  budget  is  nearly  $4.4  billion  compared  to  $3.3  billion  in  FY2009.  The  Government's \ncountercyclical development program includes a large increase in ADP allocations.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nincrease  the  focus  on  SSNPs  that  contribute  to  human  capital  development  and  reduce  the \nimpact  of  seasonality  in  the  availability  of  work.  The  Government  is  willing  to  enhance  the \neligibility  criteria  for  better  targeting  and  minimizing  leaks  and  to  implement  gender  budgeting \nguidelines for tracking gender disaggregated expenditures. \n \n23. \nThe  Government  has  increasingly  recognized  the  need  for  addressing  the  generic \nproblem  of  deficiencies  and  weaknesses  in  the  broader  governance  agenda  in  the  country, \nwhich  impacts  effective  service  delivery.  Accordingly,  the  Government  is  institutionalizing  a \nnumber  of \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  service  delivery \nmechanisms  in  government  agencies.17 These  include  access  to  information  to  help  improve \ntransparency  in  public  service  provision  and  to  protect  the  rights  and  interests  of  consumers \nthrough legislative means.  \n \n\nfor  enhancing \n\ninitiatives \n\nb. \n\nInvestment Climate  \n\nThe  Government  is  aware  that  significant  acceleration  of  economic  growth  with  rapid \n24. \nand sustainable poverty reduction will require substantial scaling up of infrastructure investment \nfrom current levels, which is well beyond the financial capacity of the Government. Government \nestimates, released in June 2009, suggest an investment gap of $28 billion from FY2010 until \nFY2014  to  achieve  an  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of  8%  by  2013.18 Therefore,  the  Government \nhas launched reforms to establish an enabling environment for PPPs19 to improve the regulatory \nregime  and  simplify  procedures  as  well  as  to  provide  resources  for  mainstreaming  PPPs \nthrough  project  development,  credit  enhancement,  and  refinancing  facilities.  Further,  the \nGovernment  is  keen  to  develop  the  capital  market 20  to  help  attract  investors  to  close  the \ninfrastructure  investment  gap.  If  successfully  implemented,  PPPs  would  make  an  important \ncontribution  to  both  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  because  investment  in  social \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  in  transport  and  power  would  benefit  the  poor  both  directly  and \nindirectly through better access to health facilities, job opportunities, and market outlets.21 \n \n25. \nKeen  to  create  space  for  SMEs  to  play  their  dual  role  of  contributing  to  growth  and \nincreasing employment and incomes for poverty reduction, the Government has initiated actions \nto  facilitate  SMEs'  access  to  credit  information  and  is  pursuing  the  enactment  of  a  secured \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB is extending support to enhance anticorruption measures, transparency, and accountability  in public service \ndelivery through ADB. 2007.

Progress  has  been  achieved  in  terms  of  improving  procedures, \ndeveloping a computerized database, streamlining administrative practices, reducing time lags \nin  the  preparation  of  budget  and  accounting  reports,  and  developing  capacity  in  budgeting, \naccounting,  and  auditing.  Recent  PFM  reforms  have  meant  that  timeliness  of  fiscal  reporting \nhas  improved.  To  strengthen  budget  execution,  efforts  have  been  made  to  improve  the \naccuracy  and  timeliness  of  accounts  by  further  computerizing  accounting  transactions.  In \naddition,  the  process  of  preparing  the  Annual  Finance  and  Appropriation  Accounts  has  been \nstreamlined. Government is also increasingly generating data on its contingent liabilities vis-\u00e0-\nvis state-owned enterprises and reporting them. Increased transparency and timeliness provide \nthe  basis  for  enhancing  incentives  for  cost  saving  and  improved  resource  management.  The \nGovernment  is  also  reviewing  civil  service  salaries  and  emoluments  for  providing  adequate \nincentives. \n \n27. \nSeveral  new  measures  announced  by  the  Government  to  raise  the  tax-to-GDP  ratio \nprovide  opportunities  to  expand  the  tax  base,  withdraw  certain  exemptions  and  exclusions, \nsimplify  procedures,  amend  laws,  and  streamline  tax  administration.  The  Government  is  also \ncommitted to enhancing transparency in the procurement process. Steps have also been taken \nto  develop  awareness  regarding  information  on  progress  of  implementation,  purchase  plans, \nand  monitoring  of  important  projects  included  in  the  ADP.  The  MTBF  is  being  introduced  in \nadditional  ministries.  These  measures  set  the  basis  to  better  manage  public  resource \nallocations and enhance the link between the poverty reduction strategy and the annual budgets. \n \nB. \n\nADB Strategy and Operations \n\nADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006\u2013201024 seeks to assist Bangladesh in \n28. \naddressing  the  critical  constraints  to  economic  growth,  social  development, 25  and  good \ngovernance.

While  the  new  government  is  reviewing  the  NSAPR-II  against  its  election \nmanifesto (para. 7), dialogue with key government officials during the recently conducted CPS \nmidterm  review  indicated  no  major  change  in  development  priorities.  The  Country  Operations \nBusiness Plan 2010\u20132012, which is an appendix to the CPS midterm review, takes into account \na possible slowdown in revenue collection in view of the global crisis, which could constrain the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  finance  essential  public  spending  on  infrastructure  and  social  sector \nprograms.  \n \n29. \n During  2010\u20132012,  ADB  is  expected  to  continue  to  play  a  major  role  in  supporting \ninvestment and policy and institutional reforms in energy and power, transport, education, and \nintegrated  urban  infrastructure  (including  water  supply  and  sanitation).  ADB  will  also  continue \nintegrating  governance  concerns  into  its  sector  operations  as  well  as  its  support  for  building \nlocal  government  capacity  to  plan  and  deliver  services  in  urban  primary  health  care,  and \nparticipatory  water  management,  as  well  as  rural  development  (including  agriculture). 26  In \nparticular,  the  surge  in  global  food  prices  in  2008  underscored  the  continued  need  for \nassistance to enhance the long-term productivity of agriculture. In view of the success of earlier \nprograms,  ADB  will  consider  providing  further  assistance  to  improve  core  governance  through \nprograms  to  combat  corruption,  improve  access  to  justice,  and  move  ahead  with  civil  service \nreform, and to develop  the SME sector. Considering the emerging concerns and impact, ADB \nwill also scale up support for enhancing the Government\u2019s preparedness to cope with the effects \nof  climate  change.  To  effectively  deliver  development  results,  ADB  will  seek  to  strengthen \ncooperation  with  development  partners,  mobilize  greater  cofinancing,  catalyze  private  sector \nand civil society involvement in development activities, promote PPPs, further improve portfolio \nperformance, and enhance subregional cooperation. \n \nC. \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\nSeveral development partners27 are supporting effective social service delivery, creating \n\n30. \na more conducive investment climate, and strengthening the PFM system (Appendix 4). \n   \n31. \nFor implementing the SSNPs, multilateral agencies have focused on providing budgetary \nsupport.  The  World  Bank  is  expected  to  provide  in  the  first  half  of  2010  budgetary  support \n(including  likely  support  for  SSNPs)  to  the  Government  after  the  NSAPR-II  is  revised  and \napproved  and  its  new  Country  Assistance  Strategy  is  finalized.  The  World  Bank  is  financing \nprojects for supporting safety nets and employment creation and also providing assistance for \nextending social care services for persons with disabilities and vulnerable children as a means \nof  promoting  equity  and  social  inclusion.  In  addition,  the  World  Bank  is  supporting  a  Social \nInvestment Program to improve livelihoods for families affected by cyclone Sidr. The European \nUnion  (EU)  is  financing  three  social  safety  net  projects.  Support  from  bilateral  and  United \nNations agencies have focused on food procurement and distribution through a well-coordinated \n\n                                                 \n26 Reforms in the PFM and service delivery as proposed in the PESF will further strengthen the governance reforms \ninitiated  under  the  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a \nProposed  Program  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Good \nGovernance Program. Manila.  \n\n27 Bangladesh  has  a  well-functioning  development  partner  coordination  mechanism  in  place  through  a  local \nconsultative  group  (LCG).  The  LCG  plenary,  the  apex  body  of  the  LCG,  is  co-chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the \nEconomic  Relations  Division,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  the  head  of  a  designated  development  partner \nagency. The LCG meets frequently, at least once every month. It has subgroups for several sectors composed of \nthe representatives of the concerned development partners. ADB coordinates the energy and transport subgroups \nand  actively  participates  in  numerous  others.  The  subgroups  meet  several  times  a  year.  In  August  2008,  15 \ndevelopment  partners  signed  with  Government  an  agreement  to  move  toward  a  Joint  Cooperation  Strategy  for \nbetter harmonization and alignment of development partner support, which is under preparation. \n\n\fapproach.  The  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  is \nfunding  a  project  on  Economic  Empowerment  of  the  Poorest  to  improve  their  livelihoods, \nparticularly  women  and  children.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  is \nfinancing a Food Assistance Program that provides a safety net for the poor through food and \ncash  for  work  projects.  In  parallel  with  the  ADB's  Emergency  Assistance  for  Food  Security \nProject (footnote 25), the World Bank provided budgetary support in response to the food price \ncrisis  in  2008.  In  addition  to  their  regular  programs,  development  partners  (including  ADB) \nroutinely provide food aid and support for relief and reconstruction following natural disasters.  \n \n32. \nFor improving the investment climate, DFID and the EU are supporting the activities of \nthe  Bangladesh  Investment  Climate  Fund  managed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation \n(IFC).  The  World  Bank,  DFID,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  (Debt  Cancellation  Fund)  are  funding  the  Private  Sector  Development \nSupport  Project  aiming  to  improve  Bangladesh\u2019s  investment  climate  by  streamlining  key \nregulations,  building  capacity  of  a  selected  group  of  government  officials,  and,  as  a  special \nfocus, developing special economic zones with international standard infrastructure. The South \nAsia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF)  is  supported  by  ADB,  EU,  DFID,  IFC,  the \nGovernment  of  Norway,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  and  the  Government  of \nthe  Netherlands.  The  Investment  Climate  Assessment  component  of  the  SEDF  works  in \npartnership with the development partners to produce comprehensive analytical and diagnostic \nstudies  on  the  overall  investment  climate  and  specific  elements  of  the  business  environment. \nOne  of  the  largest  projects  for  SME  promotion  in  Bangladesh  is  KATALYST  (Developing \nBusiness Service Markets), which aims to improve market access, management and technical \nskills, and production methods.28 KATALYST also identifies key constraints and opportunities in \nsectors and promotes mechanisms that improve business. \n \n33. \nIn the area of PFM, the Financial Management Reform Project, funded by DFID and the \nGovernment of the Netherlands, and which sought to strengthen PFM capacity of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) and selected line ministries, has just been completed (July 2009). A new project \n(2009\u20132014), to be financed through a multi-donor trust fund to be managed by the World Bank, \nis  soon  expected  to  be  commissioned  which  will  modernize  budget  management  institutions \nwith emphasis on performance orientation in PFM, and improve the effectiveness of the formal \ninstitutions of financial accountability such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General \nand relevant parliamentary bodies. The local consultative group (LCG) of development partners \non PFM/Financial Oversight works as a regular forum for coordination, information sharing, and \nliaison with the Government and Parliament on all PFM issues related to budgeting and financial \noversight.  Development  partners  are  also  supporting  the  improvement  of  public  expenditure \nsystems,  including  capacity  building  for  PFM  and  enhancement  of  the  mechanisms  for  local \naccountability.  \n \nD. \n\nRationale \n\n34.  While Bangladesh's GDP growth is respectable, it is inadequate to make a major dent in \nthe level of poverty within a reasonable time frame. The country needs further economic policy \nmeasures  along  with  institutional  reforms  to  lock  in  on  a  higher  growth  trajectory,  which  is \nnecessary for accelerated poverty reduction. The lack of fiscal space and weak implementation \ncapacity  has  further  constrained  the  Government's  ability  to  undertake  reforms  for  spurring \nhigher economic growth and accelerating poverty reduction. At the same time, the Government \n\n                                                 \n28 KATALYST  is  funded  by  DFID,  Swiss  Development  Corporation,  Netherlands  Development  Organization,  and \n\nCanadian International Development Agency. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n \n\nneeds  additional  resources  to  protect  vulnerable  groups,  mostly  women  and  children  through \nappropriate  SSNPs.  The  new  Government  has  shown  the  resolve  to  deal  with  the  twin \nchallenges  of  accelerating  reforms  and  protecting  vulnerable  populations  through  quick  and \ntransparent policy actions to preempt hardships and prevent a deeper crisis. The crisis is seen \nby  the  Government  as  an  opportunity  to  undertake  policy  reforms  to  ensure  development \nmomentum well into the future.  \n\n \nBangladesh  has  requested  assistance  to  deal  with  the  impact  of  the  global  crisis  and \n35. \nother  exogenous  shocks.  It  has  sought  additional  resources  to  meet  the  adjustment  costs  of \ncontinued  policy  and  institutional  reforms  that  would  help  consolidate  earlier  gains  from \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  by  scaling  up  public\u2013private  investments  in  essential \ninfrastructure  while  also  helping  to  broaden  the  coverage  of  SSNPs  and  eliminating  internal \ninstitutional  limitations  that  reduce  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  Accordingly,  support  is \nproposed  through  two  facilities:  the  PESF  and  the  CSF.  The  objective  of  the  PESF  is  to \naccelerate  reforms  that  are  essential  for  long-term  economic  growth  while  also  improving \nservice delivery for social protection. The CSF will supplement the PESF by providing support to \nscale up the Government's countercyclical development program.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROGRAM \n\n36. \nThe  proposed  PESF  aims  to  support  the  Government  to  better  address  the  adverse \nimpact  on  the  economy  from  exogenous  shocks  as  well  as  inherent  weaknesses  in  economic \nand  social  service  delivery.  The  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  and  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix for the PESF are in Appendix 5. \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the proposed PESF is to enhance pro-poor and gender-inclusive growth \n37. \nand improve the living standards of the vulnerable populations. The outcome of the PESF is a \nstable  macroeconomic  environment  where  private  sector  development  is  emphasized  and \nwhere  women  and  vulnerable  populations  have  greater  access  to  social  services,  including \nthrough effective gender targeting. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n(ii)  conducive \n\nThe proposed PESF supports the Government in putting in place policy actions in three \n38. \nareas:  (i)  effective  service  delivery\u2014by  supporting  the  Government  to  undertake  a  significant \nscaling up of SSNPs, effective gender targeting, and legal measures for greater say in ensuring \nquality  and  effectiveness  of  service  delivery; \ninvestment  climate\u2014by \nstrengthening the Government's ability to attract private investment, in particular through PPPs, \nin  sectors  critical  to  sustain  and  accelerate  economic  growth;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  PFM \nsystem\u2014by  helping  Government  to  increase  fiscal  space  through  enhanced  efficiency  and \nintegrity in public spending, and higher revenue generation. \n \n39. \nThe  PESF  is  a  culmination  of  sustained  policy  dialogue  and  development  coordination \non  ongoing  social,  infrastructure,  governance,  and  financial  sector  interventions.  Anchored  in \nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-  and  long-term  reform  strategies  for  addressing  weaknesses  and \nvulnerabilities,  the  design  of  the  proposed  PESF  benefited  from  the  Government's  proactive \nreform stance. The Government, in consultation with ADB, identified specific actions to address \nthe weaknesses and vulnerabilities and made corresponding resource allocations in the FY2010 \n\n\fbudget.  The  clear  priorities  of  the  Government  and  the  concern  over  the  impact  of  the  global \ncrisis enabled substantial progress on the reforms supported by the PESF.  \n \n\n1. \n\nMore Effective Service Delivery \n\n40.

Considering  Bangladesh's  low  income  level \nand high poverty incidence, as well as its vulnerability to disasters, the Government expanded \nthe existing SSNPs for the vulnerable populations (Appendix 3, Table A3). The total allocation \nfor SSNPs at Tk173.3 billion ($2.5 billion) in FY2010 is a 25.2% increase over FY2009 (paras. \n75  and  77).  The  number  of  beneficiaries 29  is  also  expected  to  increase  substantially.  The \nGovernment  has  introduced  a  new  Employment  Generation  Program  for  the  Hardcore  Poor30 \nwith  an  allocation  of  Tk11.8  billion  ($170  million)  for  an  estimated  4.9  million  person-months. \nThe Government will spend at least 60% of the budget allocated to the Employment Generation \nProgram for the Hardcore Poor before release of the second tranche of the PESF. Further, the \nGovernment  will  finalize  an  operational  plan31 for  developing  a  comprehensive  list  of  hardcore \npoor and other vulnerable populations for more effective targeting of SSNPs. \n \n41. \nFor ensuring food security, an integral part of SSNPs, the Government has drawn up a \ndetailed  plan  of  action  outlining  strategic  areas  of  intervention,  and  priority  actions  to  be \nundertaken in the short, medium, and long-term during 2008\u20132015. The plan of action identifies \nresponsible  government  and  non-government  agencies  and  defines  policy  targets  and \nindicators for monitoring progress. Aligned with the NSAPR-II, the plan provides guidelines on \ninter-ministerial coordination and sectoral planning and budgeting for effective implementation.  \n \n42. \nGender  Targeting. In line with the constitutional requirement for promoting social and \neconomic  equality  as  well  as  for  better  targeting  of  SSNPs,  the  Government  has  finalized \ngender  budgeting  guidelines  for  tracking  gender  disaggregated  expenditures  to  inform \nbudgeting decisions and guide policy reform priorities. Further, the budget and beneficiary data \nfor  four  ministries  have  been  disaggregated  on  a  gender  basis  and  a  report  on  Women's \nAdvancement  and  Rights  in  Four  Ministries'  Activities32 was  submitted  to  the  Parliament.  The \nGovernment will implement the budgeting guidelines in the 20 line ministries that have adopted \nthe  MTBF  (para.  53)  to  ensure  greater  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  share  of \nexpenditure for women's development.33  \n \n43. \nOversight Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups. The enhancement of the SSNPs and \nintroduction of gender budgeting guidelines will not necessarily ensure that services are being \nprovided  effectively.  To  improve  service  delivery,  the  Government  has  enacted  the  Right  to \nInformation (RTI) Act, 200934 which provides for access to information on public service delivery \n\n                                                 \n29 Poor people having less than $1 dollar daily income, especially women and destitute workers, who are bypassed \n\nby the growth process and also miss out on most of the targeted interventions.   \n\n30 This  will  replace  an  earlier  '100  days  Employment  Scheme'  which  was  disbanded  due  to  widespread  leaks  and \n\npoor targeting.  \n\n31 The Government intends to utilize the National Identity Cards, prepared for the 2008 elections, and link them with \n\nthe database of the MOF and with the lists of SSNP beneficiaries.  \n\n32 The  report  reviews  how  issues  of  women's  advancement  have  been  dealt  with  as  well  as  the  decision  making \nstructure from a gender perspective by analyzing the employment structure and salary distributions in the ministries \nfor education, health and family welfare, social welfare, and food and disaster management. \n\n33 The  gender  budgeting  guidelines  have  a  specific  section  on  poverty  and  gender  impact  to  be  adhered  to  by  the \n\nministries that are using the MTBF. \n\n34 ADB's  Good  Governance  Program  (footnote  17)  had  provided  assistance  to  the  Government  to  prepare  the  act, \nand has also set aside resources to support its implementation. The RTI Act is part of the broader perspective on \ngood governance being taken by Government as contained in the National Integrity Strategy that it is developing. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\nto ensure proper accountability of local officials. The RTI law became effective from 1 July 2009 \nwith the appointment of the Chairman and two Commissioners of the Information Commission \nalong  with  provision  of  a  new  office  and  some  staff.  The  organization  structure  of  the \nInformation Commission will be approved by the Government, and operational staff appointed. \nIn addition, the Government, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program, \nwill  develop  an  action  plan  to  put  in  place  a  citizen's  charter 35  for  public  sector  agencies \nincluding its dissemination across the country for improving service delivery and implementation. \n \n44. \nIn  addition  to  the  RTI  Act,  the  Government  also  enacted  the  Consumers'  Right \nProtection  Act,  200936 for  enhancing  the  quality  of  services.  The  Consumers'  Right  Protection \nAct, which became effective in April 2009, aims to protect the rights of consumers and prevent \nactivities that interfere with consumer rights. To implement the act, a National Consumers' Right \nProtection Council will be established with financing provided from the block allocations in the \nFY2010  budget.  The  National  Consumers'  Right  Protection  Council  will  undertake  elaborate \npublicity and awareness building campaigns through print and electronic media, and by holding \nseminars, workshops, and symposiums.37  \n \n\n2. \n\nMore Conducive Investment Climate \n\nPrivate  Sector  Development  and  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships.  Mainstreaming \n45. \nPPPs has emerged as a key Government priority for bridging infrastructure gaps across all the \neconomic sectors. Drawing lessons from international best practices, the Government has taken \na comprehensive approach for implementing PPPs that covers (i) a position paper on PPPs for \ninvestment  and  operations;  (ii)  allocation  of  funds  for  a  viability  gap  fund38 for  enhancing  the \nbankability  of  projects,  attracting  private  capital,  and  catalyzing  private  sector  efficiencies;  (iii) \nallocation of funds for a technical assistance fund for financing PPP project preparation activities \nsuch as feasibility studies; and (iv) allocation of funds for a PPP infrastructure investment fund \nto finance bankable PPP projects on a loan or equity basis.  \n \n46.  Going forward, the Government will revise and reissue the 2004 PSIG to place a concise, \ntransparent and strong legal and institutional framework for PPPs. In addition, a PPP Cell will be \nestablished  and  operationalized  for  coordinating  the  mainstreaming  of  PPPs.  The  progress  of \nPPPs  in  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh,  including  the  legal  and  institutional  frameworks,  will  be \nmonitored and assessed and review reports posted on the MOF website.  \n \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise and Housing Sector Development. Harnessing \n47. \nthe SME sector's potential for creating jobs and providing greater access to housing is both an \nimmediate  priority  as  well  as  fundamental  for  setting  the  basis  for  higher  long-term  growth.39 \nAccordingly, the Government has raised the size of allocations from TK8.0 billion ($116 million) \nto  Tk11  billion  ($159  million)  to  its  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Fund  and  Housing  Fund \nmaintained with the central bank. In addition, during the PESF, the Government will prepare an \n                                                 \n35 In May 2007, the Government instructed all ministries and agencies to formulate a \"citizen's charter\" that includes \nthe duties and responsibilities of officials along with their telephone numbers to be displayed including on the web. \n36 The  scope  of  the  act  covers  price,  quality,  weight,  and  availability  of,  and  access  to  goods  and  services.  The \nnational council and the district committees under it will create awareness about consumers' rights, and supervise \nthe activities of enterprises selling goods or rendering services with the objective of protecting consumers' rights. \n\n37 Supplementary Appendix E provides summary of the laws enacted as part of the PESF.   \n38 This support is especially important for sectors where financial rates of returns are low but social returns are high.  \n39  Because  of  higher  employment-intensity  and  lower  capital  requirement,  the  expansion  of  the  SME  Fund  is \nexpected  to  boost  the  SME  sector,  create  more  job  opportunities,  and  raise  domestic  demand  by  increasing  the \npurchasing  power  of  households.  This  will  add  stimulus  to  the  economy  through  the  linkage  effects  to  other \ndomestic sectors, and create jobs. \n\n\faction  plan  to  support  SME  centers,  women's  entrepreneurship,  and  one-stop  facility  for \nenterprises. The Government will also merge two state-owned banks, Bangladesh Shilpa Bank \nand  Bangladesh  Shilpa  Rin  Shangstha,  for  streamlining  their  operations  and  enhancing  SME \nfinancing.  \n \n48. \nEnhanced  Business  Environment.  Bridging  the  major  investment  gap,  especially  in \ninfrastructure,  requires  significant  foreign  direct  investment.  Bangladesh's  approval  of  the \nthe  Government's \nMoney  Laundering  Prevention  Act \ncommitment to transparency and good governance and is likely to enhance investor confidence. \nThe Act equips the Anti Corruption Commission and Bangladesh Bank with powers to deal with \noffences  related  to  money  laundering.  The  Government  has  established  the  Bangladesh \nInstitute of Capital Markets to foster a policy environment and institutional structure necessary \nfor growth and development of the domestic capital market. The Government has also extended \nmerchant banking facilities to three state-owned commercial banks to increase trading volumes \nin the capital market.  \n \n\nin  February  2009  demonstrates \n\n3. \n\nStrengthened Public Financial Management  \n\n49. \nPublic  Sector  Efficiency  and  Revenue  Mobilization.  A  strong  PFM  system\u2014\nespecially where the state takes on a considerable role to provide services\u2014relies substantially \non prioritizing expenditures and enhancing revenues. The Government has taken major steps in \npursuit  of  its  policy  for  corporatizing  public  sector  enterprises  to  improve  service  delivery, \nviability, efficiency, and competitiveness, and to reduce subsidies. Specifically, the Government \nhas (i) divested 30% of its shares of Jamuna Oil and Meghna Oil for subscription by the general \npublic;  (ii)  converted  the  national  air  carrier  Bangladesh  Biman  into  a  limited  liability  company \nunder  the  Company  Act  through  the  Bangladesh  Biman  Corporation  (Amendment)  Act,  2009; \nand  (iii)  converted  the  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board  into  a  limited  liability \ncompany  under  the  Company  Act  through  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board \n(Amendment) Act, 2009. \n \n50. \nAlong with divestments and corporatization, the Government has amended the Income \nTax Ordinance, 1984, to streamline income tax administration, simplify tax collection procedures, \nand  introduce  revenue-enhancing  and  rationalization  measures.  As  a step  toward  phasing  out \nthe tax holiday schemes by 2012, a reduced tax rate for certain sectors40 has been introduced \nto  gradually  prepare  them  to  shoulder  a  normal  tax  burden.  With  regard  to  administrative \narrangements,  the  appointment  of  the  chairman  of  the  National  Board  of  Revenue  (NBR)  has \nbeen  streamlined  through  the  National  Board  of  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act,  2009. 41  The \nGovernment  has  also  implemented  a  debt  service  liability  management  system  for  keeping \nmore  accurate  records  and  improving  transparency  of  liabilities  resulting  from  borrowings  by \nstate-owned enterprises. During the PESF, the Government will finalize plans to expand the tax \nbase by identifying new taxpayers through surveys covering city, district, and sub-district levels. \nThe Government will also improve the incentive structure for civil servants by implementing the \nrecommendations of the Pay Commission.  \n \n\n                                                 \n40 These  are  for  sectors  such  as  agro-processing,  rubber-based  goods,  textile  industries  and  machinery,  spinning \n\nindustries, and garments-producing industries. \n\n41 Earlier,  the  provision  was  to  appoint  one  of  the  members  of  the  Board  as  the  NBR  chairman.  In  practice,  a \nsecretary  to  the  Government  is  always  appointed  as  the  NBR  chairman.  The  National  Board  of  Revenue \n(Amendment) Act, 2009 provides for appointment of a secretary to the Government as chairman of the NBR and \nremoves the anomaly and legal contradiction. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n51. \nStreamlined Financial Management Processes. As part of the efforts to streamline the \nfinancial  management  process  and  enhance  transparency,  the  web-based  Integrated  Budget \nand Accounting System for facilitating daily consolidation of accounting data has been extended \nto  58  districts  to  make  it  easier  to  share  on-line  information  for  budgeting  and  accounting \npurposes.42 In  this  context,  the  Government  will  issue  policy  directives  and  prepare  an  action \nplan  to  improve  the  quality  and  timely  submission  of  the  annual  accounts  of  the  government \nagencies.43  \n \n52. \nSlow  implementation  of  public  sector  investment  projects  is  a  major  factor  hindering \ninfrastructure  development  in  the  country.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government  will  review  and \nrevise public sector project approval procedures to bring greater dynamism and speed in project \nprocessing.  The  Government  will  also  set  up  a  high  level  task  force  to  enhance  monitoring  of \nmajor public sector projects covered by the ADP. The aim is to improve project implementation \nthrough more intensive monitoring, closer scrutiny, and regular supervision (para. 80).  \n \nis \n53.  Mainstreaming  Medium-Term  Budgetary  Framework.  The  Government \nmainstreaming the MTBF for integrating revenue and development budgets and strengthening \nthe link between the national poverty reduction strategy and annual budgets. The application of \nthe MTBF in 20 ministries during FY2010 is intended to strengthen fiscal management and the \nflexibility and capacity of the line ministries to manage resource allocation. The Government will \nestablish  a  planning  and  budget  wing  in  at  least  five  ministries  where  the  MTBF  has  been \nadopted  to  ensure  dedicated  staff  and  developing  adequate  capacity  for  its  implementation. \nFurther, as an initial step toward a decentralized budget, the Government will finalize plans to \npresent  a  district-wise  budget  starting  with  one  district  per  administrative  division. \nComplementing  these  measures,  the  NSAPR-II  is  being  revised  to  embody  the  development \npriorities of the Government. The Government has also established a Macroeconomic Wing in \nthe  Finance  Division  headed  by  a  full  time  joint  secretary  and  supported  by  a  number  of \nqualified  staff  for  enabling  the  MOF  to  deal  with  evolving  macroeconomic  developments \npreemptively.  \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features  \n\n54. \nThe most important feature of the proposed PESF is its human and gender dimensions, \nBy undertaking actions to mitigate the social impact of the crisis, and protect as well as enhance \ninvestments in human capital, it broadens support for reforms. The PESF builds on the political \ncommitment of the Government to bring about necessary economic reforms in the country. The \nreforms  reflect  the  continuum  of  policy  actions  and  ADB  engagement  in  the  sectors  and \nsubsectors  which  are  proposed  to  be  supported.  The  PESF  is  (i)  based  on  Government's \nstrategy  for  poverty  reduction,  (iii)  aligned  to  the  outcomes  sought  from  other  ADB  programs, \nand (iii) fully consistent with the interventions of other development partners.  \n \n55. \nGood  governance,  one  of  the  drivers  of  change  under  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  is \nintegrated  in  the  design  of  the  PESF  through measures  for  creating access  to information  for \nimprovement of service delivery, protection of citizens' rights, effective gender budgeting, and \nenhancing PFM. The PESF also facilitates private sector development, which is the first driver \nof  change  under  ADB's  Strategy  2020.  Corporatization  and  divestment  will  enable  more \nspace  for  private  sector  participation  in  industry,  infrastructure,  and  service  delivery. \n                                                 \n42 The network will be expanded to Upazila (sub-district) accounts offices during the next phase of PFM reform.   \n43 There is no legal deadline for submitting the Annual Finance and Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. Delays in \ngetting certification from the  Office of Comptroller and Auditor General on these accounts  lead to  a considerable \ndelay in the publication and submission of these documents to Parliament. \n\n\fProgram Cost \n\nGreater  fiscal  space  will  enable  the  Government  to  allocate  more  resources  to  much-\nneeded  social  and  economic  infrastructure,  which,  in  turn,  provides  more  opportunities  for \nthe private sector. \n \nD. \n \n56. \nThe PESF reflects the development financing needs of the Government as specified in \nthe  FY2010  budget  (Table  2).  The  Government  aims  to  increase  development  and  social \nspending  in  FY2010  given  the  stress  imposed  on  the  economy  (and  especially  the  vulnerable \ngroups)  by  the  global  crisis  and  natural  disasters.  Given  this  need  for  additional  funding,  a \nbudget deficit of 5.0% of GDP is targeted for FY2010.  \n \n\nTable 2: Gap and Borrowing in Overall Budget for FY2010 \n($ million) \n\nItem \nDomestic revenue \nForeign grants \n \n \n \n \nTo be covered by: \nForeign borrowing \nDomestic borrowing \n \n\nTotal revenue\n\nExpenditure\nResource gap\n\n \n\n \n\nSub-total\n\nTotal \n\n11,506 \n743\n\n \n \n12,249 \n \n16,481 \n4,232 \n \n \n \n4,232 \n\n1,256 \n2,976 \n\n \n\nSource: Government of Bangladesh FY2010 Budget. \n\n \n \n57. \nbreakdown of ADB support for SSNPs through the PESF is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\nThe PESF only meets a fraction of the related adjustment costs (Appendix 6). A detailed \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n58. \nPESF which consists of:  \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  program  loan  of  $244.85  million  from  ADB  for  the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \n\n \n$100  million  loan  from  ADB's  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  (OCR).  The  loan  will \nhave  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \nfacility,  a \ndetermined \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \non  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \nchoices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n\nlending \n\n$100  million  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  special  funds  resources,  which  will  have  a  fixed \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest will be at 1.0% per \nyear during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter (ADF soft term). \n\n$44.85 million loan from ADB's special funds resources, which will have a fixed \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest will be at 1.6% per \nyear for the life of the loan (ADF hard term).  \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Period and Tranches \n\n59. \nThe PESF will be implemented during October 2009 to December 2010.

Gains have been made on the macroeconomic front and social \nsector development including on poverty alleviation. Real economic growth has been sustained \nat above 6%, inflation ranged between 6.5\u20137.2% except during the commodity price shocks of \n2008, and the external current account balance has been consistently in surplus due to buoyant \nexport  and  remittance  inflows.  Gains  on  social  indicators  have  also  been  impressive  although \nmuch remains to be done with 40% of the population still below the poverty line. \n \n61. \nSuch  strong  macroeconomic  performance  is  the  outcome  of  a  long  track  record  of \nprudent  demand  management  policies  of  successive  governments.  By  limiting  the  level  of  the  \nfiscal deficit in relation to GDP to well below the level considered debt-stabilizing, both the debt-\nto-GDP  and  debt  service  ratios  have  declined  significantly  over  time  and  are  currently  at \nreasonably  low  levels.  Sound  macroeconomic  management  has  also  enabled  the  country  to \nwithstand  major  external  shocks  while  sustaining  its  growth  momentum.  The  economy  was \nseverely tested in FY2008 when it experienced repeat floods and the catastrophic cyclone Sidr, \nwith  major  loss  of  life  and  destruction  of  property  and  crops;  and  the  external  shock  resulting \nfrom surging petroleum and other commodity prices.  \n \n62. \nThe economy had rebounded strongly from these shocks, and gained further momentum \nin the first quarter of FY2009 (July\u2013September 2008) before the impact of the global crisis set in. \nExport  receipts  grew  by  42.4%,  import  payments  rose  by  34.9%,  workers\u2019  remittances  surged \nby  43.5%,  private  sector  credit  expanded  rapidly  (26.5%),  and  firms  were  in  the  midst  of \nexpanding  their  production  capacity.  The  overall  bullish  environment  was  also  reflected  in  the \nindex of manufacturing, which grew by more than 12% and term lending for investment, which \ngrew by 30%. \n\n                                                 \n44 In  reviewing  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  policies  and  public  finances,  the  International  Monetary  Fund's  (IMF) \nlatest Article IV consultations were referred to. The latest IMF consultations with the Bangladesh authorities were \nheld in September 2008. \n\n\f63. \nUp  to  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  FY2009,  all  indicators  were  pointing  to  a  robust \nmacroeconomic  outlook  for  FY2010  with  higher  economic  growth,  and  with  moderate \ninflationary  pressure  due  to  exogenous  price  shocks  as  the  only  major  challenge  for  the \nGovernment. Its intensified efforts to boost agricultural output were also paying dividends with \nsuccessive bumper rice crops. Bangladeshi textile exporters had their order books full and were \nlooking forward to brisk business. At the start of the global crisis, there was a general perception \nthat Bangladesh would be largely spared given its limited linkages with the global capital market. \nHowever, as the crisis deepened, its impact started to be felt in Bangladesh as well. \n \n64. \nKey  Transmission  Channels:  First  Round  Effects. The direct impact of the crisis on \nBangladesh economy could primarily be felt through three channels: financial sector contagion; \nforeign  trade;  and  workers\u2019  remittances,  with  the  extent  of  transmission  depending  on  the \nlinkage and exposure of the sector in question to the rest of the world. \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Sector Contagion \n\n \n\n65. \nBangladesh\u2019s  financial  sector  did  not  experience  any  turbulence  from  the  meltdown  in \nthe  global  financial  sector  because  of  its  limited  connectivity  with  the  international  financial \nsystem. Extensive capital controls, strict guidelines on the net foreign exposure of Bangladeshi \nfinancial  institutions,  and  controls  on  the  quality  and  types  of  investments  that  financial \ninstitutions  are  allowed  to  make  limited  the  exposure  of  Bangladeshi  financial  institutions  and \ntheir  potential  losses,  particularly  to  toxic  mortgage\u2013based assets.  The  prompt  steps  taken  by \nBangladesh Bank by asking all domestic financial institutions to deposit their foreign assets with \nit  and  converting  them  into  safe  assets  helped  minimize  any  loss  from  the  collapse  of  many \ninternational  financial  institutions.  These  developments  notwithstanding,  because  of  the  sharp \nmovements in exchange rates among major currencies, Bangladesh Bank had to incur a sizable \nvaluation loss in its holdings of foreign assets.  \n \n66. \nThe  stock  market  in  Bangladesh  suffered  only  moderate  losses  relative  to  its  global \ncounterparts. At the peak of the global financial meltdown when major stock markets lost almost \none-third to one-half of their market capitalization, the Dhaka Stock Exchange remained largely \nunaffected.  This  was  attributable  to  many  factors,  including  (i)  foreign  investment  in  the  stock \nmarket was estimated to be only about 3%, and because of small exposure, its impact on the \ndomestic market was minimal; and (ii) the real estate sector in Bangladesh is not leveraged and \ndid  not  experience  any  softening  in  prices,  despite  the  unprecedented  appreciations  (250%\u2013\n350%) in property values in recent years. \n \n67. \nSince  the  financial  sector  in  Bangladesh,  dominated  by  commercial  banks,  was  not \ndirectly affected by the crisis abroad, there was no liquidity and financial crisis in the domestic \neconomy. Deposit growth and credit demand both remained healthy and asset quality was not \nadversely  affected  by  the  first  round  impact  of  the  crisis.  There  was  also  no  visible  adverse \nimpact on the availability of trade financing for Bangladeshi exporters and importers. \n \n\n2. \n\nForeign Trade \n\n68. \nAfter  a  very  strong  first  quarter  of  FY2009,  exports  slowed  down  markedly.  Almost  all \ncategories  of  exports  registered  a  sharp  slowdown  (such  as  for  readymade  garments  and \nknitwear) or a sharp decline (for almost all non-garment exports). The extent of the fall in export \ngrowth and the speed of the fall were unprecedented in Bangladesh, and can only be explained \nby the external demand and price developments promoted by the crisis. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\n69. \nThe growth in exports decelerated sharply after October 2008 with the beginning of the \neconomic crisis in the industrial countries (the major destinations of Bangladeshi exports) when \nall categories of exports started to fall significantly. From October 2008 to June 2009 (the last \nthree  quarters  of  FY2009),  year-on-year  export  growth  was  only  1.4%,  a  major  drop  from  the \n23.7%  growth  in  the  corresponding  period  in  FY2008.  Three-fourths  of  the  shortfall  is \nattributable  to  textile  products  and  other  export  categories,  while  all  other  important  export \ncategories also recorded significant shortfalls. Based on the export performance since October \n2008, significant slowdown in export growth is expected in FY2010. \n \n\n3. \n\nWorkers' Remittances \n\nThe  flow  of  workers\u2019  remittances,  while  still  growing  in  dollar  terms,  is  decelerating \n70. \nrapidly  and  the  number  of  workers  going  abroad  has  declined  sharply.  Growth  of  workers\u2019 \nremittances slowed to 15.5% during January to June 2009, down from 43.5% growth recorded \nin  the  first  quarter  of  FY2009.  In  March  and  April  2009,  the  growth  rates  in  remittances  were \n9.5%  and  7.6%,  respectively.  Although  the  growth  rates  in  May  and  June  picked  up  to  22.6% \nand 22.0% respectively, the growth rate fell again to 8.0% in July 2009.  \n \n71. \nThe monthly rate of overseas worker departures declined from almost 92,000 in January \n2008  to  38,568  in  June  2009.  Much  of  the  rise  in  the  growth  of  workers  going  abroad  during \n2007\u20132008 originated from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries following the oil price \nsurge. The decline in the number of workers going abroad in recent months has also originated \nfrom the GCC countries in the aftermath of the decline in oil prices due to the global recession. \nCutbacks and postponement of investment plans in the GCC countries have contributed to this \nreduction in labor demand. The growth of remittances, which still continues, is attributable to the \nlagged effect of the large number of workers who left the country up to October/November 2008. \nGenerally, it takes several months before the workers start remitting money. After accounting for \nthis lag, the growth rate of remittances is expected to decline further in the coming months.  \n \n72. \nSecond  Round  Effects  of  the  Crisis.  The adverse impact of the marked slowdown in \nexport  and  remittance  growth  is  spreading  to  the  broader  domestic  economy.  Exports  and \nremittances  have  been  important  factors  contributing  to  domestic  growth.  Millions  of  ordinary \nBangladeshi households across the country are direct beneficiaries of remittance inflows and a \nlarge part of domestic demand expansion also depends on such inflows. Manufacturing sector \nperformance is significantly dependent on export sector developments and thus on the health of \nthe  global  economy.  With  global  economic  activity  likely  to  be  in  difficulty  in  the  first  half  of \nFY2010 before moving to a recovery phase, both domestic and foreign demand for Bangladeshi \nproducts is expected to remain subdued due to slower growth in remittance inflows and lower \ndemand  for  exports  leading  to  slower  manufacturing  growth.  The  uncertainties  about  the \neconomic  outlook  created  by  the  global  crisis  have  contributed  to  slower  private  investment. \nEven  firms,  which  are  expanding  their  volume  of  production,  are  postponing  or  delaying  their \ninvestment  programs  in  order  to  ride  out  the  slowdown  in  the  global  economy.  Reflecting  this \nsentiment, demand for industrial term loans fell by 9.6% during July\u2013March FY2009 compared \nwith a 66% rise recorded in the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year. \n \n73. \nThe  Government  is  also  facing  a  significant  tax  revenue  shortfall  compared  with  the \ntarget because of lower imports and slower domestic activity. The revenue performance was in \nsurplus relative to target during the first quarter of FY2009 but, thereafter, sharply turned into a \ngrowing shortfall. The shortfall in tax revenue, primarily from import-based taxes, was more than \nTk20 billion ($290 million) in FY2009. After achieving record growth in  tax  revenue  in  FY2008 \n\n\f(27.4%),45 the Government set the tax revenue target at Tk545 billion ($7.9 billion) for FY2009. \nAt  that  time,  it  was  envisaged  that  the  targeted  revenue  growth  of  15.5%  was  not  ambitious \ncompared  with  recent  performance.  The  actual  revenue  growth  in  FY2009  was  10.7%,  down \nfrom 27.4% in FY2008. All major taxes recorded sluggish growth after September 2008.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Countercyclical Development Program and Capacity Assessment \n\nPolicy  Responses \n\nIn  April  2009,  the  Government  announced  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  for  Tk34.2  billion \n74. \n($495 million) to support the sectors adversely affected by the global meltdown. Cash incentives, \nconsisting primarily of direct transfers to exporters, were raised for sectors like leather, jute, and \nfrozen  foods.  The  total  allocation  for  the  export  sectors  was  Tk4.5  billion  ($65  million).  The \npackage  also  allowed  for  greater  flexibility  in  repayment  of  bank  loans  for  all  manufacturing \nexporters.  Allocations  under  various  special  refinancing  schemes  were  also  raised  for  SMEs \nand the housing industry, while larger allocations were made for agriculture, power, and SSNPs. \n \nthe  Budget.  The  Government's  countercyclical \n75. \ndevelopment program announced through the FY2010 budget has four broad components: (i) a \nfiscal stimulus package; (ii) an expansion of the SSNPs; (iii) a substantial increase in the ADP; \nand  (iv)  introduction  of  a  new  PPP  scheme.  In  selecting  these  components  and  making \ncorresponding resource allocations in the FY2010 budget, the Government in consultation with \nADB  focused  on  measures  that  mitigate  the  social  impact  of  the  crisis  and  help  catalyze \neconomic  recovery  and  long-term  growth.  The  Government  expects  these  measures  to \ncontribute  significantly  in  offsetting  the  effects  of  the  global  recession  on  the  Bangladesh \neconomy.  \n \n\nthrough \n\nTable 4: Government's Countercyclical Development Program \n ($ million) \n\n  FY2010 \n\nIntroduced in FY2010 \n\n724 \n2,509 \n4,416 \n362 \n\nFY2009 \n495 \n2,005 \n3,330 \n0 \n\n% Increase \n      46.3% \n      25.2% \n      32.6% \n\n \nFiscal Stimulus Package \nSocial Safety Net Programs \nAnnual Development Program \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership \n           Source: Government of Bangladesh  \n \n76. \nThe  Government  has  announced  that  it  will  continue  the  fiscal  stimulus  package \nannounced in April 2009 (para. 74) through FY2010 and expand the package further based on \nhow the situation evolves. The Tk50 billion ($724 million) fund established in the FY2010 budget \nwill  allow  the  Government  to  have  the  required  flexibility  to  respond  in  a  timely  manner  to  the \nproblems  faced  by  different  sectors.  The  cash  incentives  announced  in  the  first  stimulus \npackage will also continue and the funds will be disbursed in six-monthly installments through \nBangladesh Bank. Roughly one-third of the new FY2010 fiscal stimulus allocation is earmarked \nfor the export sector to offset the effects of the global recession on export items such as textiles, \nfrozen foods, leather goods and certain other items. The power sector is also expected to get a \nsubstantial part of the fiscal stimulus package, in addition to agriculture. The Government has \nalso announced measures to reduce the tax burden on certain export items.  \n \n77. \nConsistent with the Government\u2019s political commitment to alleviate poverty, about 15.2% \nof  the  total  non-development  and  development  budget  (2.5%  of  GDP)  has  been  allocated  for \nSSNPs.  The  existing  SSNPs  have  been  strengthened  and  some  new  ones  introduced \n                                                 \n45 The stronger revenue collection was due to tax revenue collected by the NBR, which accounts for over 95% of tax \n\nrevenues, and over 78% of total revenues. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\n(Appendix  3).  The  major  components  of  the  SSNPs  include  cash  transfers,  food  security, \nmicrocredit, employment generation, and stipends for students. In addition, the enhanced ADP \nand  new  PPP  scheme,  if  implemented  fully,  would  amount  to  a  44%  ($1.45  billion)  rise  in \ngovernment  capital  spending  in  FY2010.  In  addition  to  boosting  domestic  activity,  if  executed \neffectively,  the  additional  spending  through  the  ADP  and  PPPs  would  help  bridge  the \ninfrastructure gap and contribute to future growth.  \n \nCapacity  Assessment.  The  Bangladesh  authorities  have  a  long  experience  in \n78. \nadministering SSNPs and the ADP. However, implementation has been less than effective due \nto a number of factors including governance, capacity, and monitoring.  \n \nDuring the last two decades, the Government  has been pursuing a number of  SSNPs. \n79. \nSSNPs  are  mainly  administered  through  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management, \nMinistry of Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s Affairs. Many SSNPs are \nimplemented in collaboration with nongovernmental organizations and are often cofinanced by \ndevelopment  partners  (para.  31).  Greater  attention  is  needed  to  (i)  increase  the  focus  on \nprograms that contribute to human capital development, (ii) reduce the impact of seasonality in \nthe availability of work, (iii) increase the focus on the urban poor, and (iv) increase the focus on \nother  disadvantaged  groups.  For  reducing  leakages  and  improving  targeting,  implementation \ncapacity  at  the  level  of  local  administration  and  agencies  needs  to  be  enhanced,  oversight  of \nproject  execution  needs  to  be  improved  and  transparency  about  entitlements  needs  to  be \nensured (paras. 40-44). The Government is aware that greater emphasis on external monitoring, \nas well as building monitoring capacity of the line agencies, is needed to minimize leakages and \nit has taken steps to address these issues. \n \n80.\u00a0\nImplementing  the  infrastructure  components  of  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical \ndevelopment program will also be a challenge. In recent years, ADP implementation has been \nmuch lower than target. The size of the ADP has declined by half in relation to GDP over the \nyears.  A  review  of  the  last  five  fiscal  years\u2019  actual  ADP  spending  against  the  budget  targets \nsuggests an average shortfall of 15% in ADP implementation. The key factors contributing to the \nunsatisfactory  ADP  implementation  are:  (i)  inadequate  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies; \nand (ii) a lack of proper monitoring of these agencies. Because of these and other constraining \nfactors, ADP utilization has failed to grow in line with the growing needs of the economy. The \nefficiency of the government implementation ministries and agencies needs to be enhanced by \nstrengthening their administrative capacity and accountability. Close monitoring of the agencies \nimplementing the ADP program would be needed for reaching the target level (para. 52).  \n \n81. \nsize of the ADP, and is adopting the following approach to accelerate implementation: \n \n\nThe  Government  is  fully  aware  of  the  implementation  challenges  due  to  the  ambitious \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreforming the time consuming and complex project approval process; \nemphasizing preparation of procurement plans earlier in the fiscal year; \npaying  greater  attention  to  the  efficiency  of  project  directors,  given  their  crucial \nrole in project implementation; \nbringing the 10 ministries, which implement 78% of the ADP, under special and \nintensive monitoring arrangement; and \nmonitoring \nestablishing a task force.  \n\nthrough  critical  path  method  process  by \n\nthe  major  projects \n\n \n82. \nThe authorities, under the chairmanship of the minister for planning, have been regularly \nreviewing project preparation in ministries. Ministries and line agencies have been instructed to \n\n\fstart  preparing  the  development  project  proposal  (government  project  document)  from  the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, prepare procurement plans within the first two months of the fiscal \nyear,  and  prepare  tender  documents  alongside  the  preparation  of  the  development  project \nproposal. Secretaries of development ministries are regularly following up on project preparation \nto  ensure  that  projects  are  ready  for  approval  on  time.  Policy  actions  on  improving  service \ndelivery,  creating  a  more  favorable  investment  climate,  and  strengthening  PFM  will  also  help \nimplement the countercyclical development program. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Impact  \n\n83. \nThe adverse impact in the export sector will affect poverty through job losses and wage \ncuts  (para.12,  Appendixes  3  and  11,  and  Supplementary  Appendix  C).  With  more  than  2.2 \nmillion  workers  directly  engaged  in  the  ready-made  garments  sector,  and  an  equal  number  of \nworkers  employed  in  ancillary  activities,  the  slowdown  in  the  ready-made  garments  sector  will \ntranslate  into  widespread  poverty  both  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  The  slowdown  in  income \ngrowth  will  hit  the  existing  poor  the  hardest.  This  group  consists  of  a  variety  of  vulnerable \ngroups, mostly the old, children, and women. SMEs are also disproportionately vulnerable to the \nglobal economic crisis, which has potentially huge poverty implications.  \n \nThe slowdown in growth of remittances will cause hardship for the recipient households \n84. \nand  deepen  poverty.  For  many  households  in  rural  areas,  remittance  earnings  are  the  main \nsource of income and livelihood. A fall in remittance income will directly affect consumption and \nthe  nutritional  status  of  a  large  number  of  families  in  rural  areas  and  have  effects  on  overall \npoverty  incidence.  The  fall  in  the  number  of  workers  leaving  for  overseas  jobs  will  create \npressure  on  the  already  slack  domestic  job  market  and  the  rise  in  the  number  of  workers \nreturning  home  after  losing  jobs,  who  often  sell  their  land  and  other  belongings  to  buy  job \ncontracts and pay for air tickets, could mean additional people slipping into poverty. \n \nD. \n\nImpact, Scope, and Coverage  \n\n85. \nThe impact of the CSF is to contribute to Government's efforts to achieve higher growth \nand improve living standards given the country's exposure to external shocks. The objective of \nthe  CSF  is  to  help  the  Government  implement  its  countercyclical  development  program \nannounced in the FY2010 budget for coping with the effects of the global crisis. The outcome of \nthe proposed CSF is macroeconomic stability, higher public and private investment, and greater \naccess to social services by women and vulnerable populations. \n \n86. \nThe  CSF  loan  will  directly  contribute  to  implementing  the  expanded  SSNPs  to  cushion \nthe impact of the global economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable. Implementing the expanded \nSSNPs  will  serve  the  twin  functions  of  immediately  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  affected  by  the  global  crisis  through  income  and  food  support,  and  also  providing \nstrong stimulus to growth, as such spending will directly raise aggregate demand. This, in turn, \nwill free up fiscal space for financing the other components of the Government's countercyclical \ndevelopment program\u2014in particular, the planned scaling up of infrastructure investment, so that \nefforts to enhance longer-term growth potential or macroeconomic stability are not compromised. \nThe Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 2 and the Development Policy Letter and \nthe Access Criteria are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n87. \nThe Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF from ADB's OCR. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  5-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility  plus  200  basis  points,  commitment  charge  of  75  basis  points  on  undisbursed  loan \nbalance, and such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under the ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n88. \n\nG. \n\nThe CSF loan will be implemented during October 2009 to December 2010. \n \nJustification and Estimate of Resource Requirements  \n\n89. \nBangladesh has a strong case for accessing the CSF and is in full compliance with the \naccess  criteria  (Appendix  7,  Supplementary  Appendix  G).  Bangladesh  is  experiencing  a  sharp \nslowdown  in  exports  and  remittances  and  slower  economic  growth.  The  country  is  also  facing \nfiscal  constraints  as  the  growth  in  revenue  collection  is  decelerating.  In  addition,  Bangladesh  is \nstill very poor and is vulnerable to natural disasters. It is also affected by an economic crisis not of \nits making. Further, as a developing member country with access to blend resources from ADB, \nBangladesh is not able to access the additional $400 million in ADF resources being provided in \nthe context of the crisis. The need for enhanced financial support from external sources to carry \nout  the  countercyclical  development  program  is  also  underlined  by  (i)  the  likely  revenue \nshortfalls,  (ii)  crowding  out  concerns  of  the  private  sector,  and  (iii)  securing  external  financial \nassurance for the budget. The proposed CSF  will not have any significant negative impact on \ndebt sustainability. The estimated resource requirement is in Table 2. \n \nLikely  Revenue  Shortfalls.  In  the  coming  fiscal  year,  when  the  Government  needs  a \n90. \nlarge amount of revenue to finance its spending plans, revenue potential will be constrained by \nsubdued  growth  in  taxes  due  to  lower  import  prices  and  the  effect  of slower  economic  growth \n(as  has  already  happened  in  FY2009).  Furthermore,  domestic  demand  would  also  be  less \nbuoyant because of slower growth in remittance inflows. Thus, while the budget targets a 15% \ngrowth  in  revenue,  this  is  not  expected  to  be  more  than  10\u201312%  even  with  some  additional \nrevenue measures.  \n \nCrowding  Out  Concerns  of  the  Private  Sector.  Because  of  the  lack  of  depth  in  the \n91. \nfinancial  system,  non-inflationary  domestic  financing  of  the  fiscal  deficit  is  difficult.  Due  to  the \nrelatively narrow base of the financial sector\u2014with a very low financial assets-to-GDP ratio\u2014the \nGovernment  is  significantly  constrained  by  its  reliance  on  domestic  financing  of  the  budget. \nTraditionally,  this  problem  has  been  addressed  through  recourse  to  reliance  on  external \nfinancing.  In  this  fiscal  year,  owing  to  the  larger  size  of  the  deficit,  the  dependence  on  both \ndomestic and foreign financing will be correspondingly higher. \n \nThe  Government's  spending  plans  to  overcome  the  global  crisis,  combined  with  an \n92. \noptimistic revenue target, have accentuated the risk for the budget deficit to exceed the 5% of \nGDP target leading to a correspondingly higher borrowing requirement. Larger deficit financing \nfrom  the  banking  system  than  envisaged  in  the  budget  would  seriously  limit  the  availability  of \n\n\fcredit  for  the  private  sector.  Nevertheless,  in  the  event  of  a  significant  shortfall  in  external \nfinancing,  the  Government  would  be  forced  to  curtail  its  spending  plans  or  resort  to  more \ndomestic borrowing. The average historical level of external borrowing amounting to $1.8 billion \nper  year  would  lead  to  a  correspondingly  higher  government  borrowing  requirement  from  the \nbanking  system.  Borrowing  of  this  magnitude  is  not  possible  without  sharply  reducing  private \nsector borrowing from the banking system. The proposed financing through the CSF will reduce \nthe  potential  crowding  out  of  the  domestic  private  sector  credit  by  reducing  government \nborrowing by an equivalent amount. A disbursement of $500 million under the CSF will reduce \nbank  financing  requirement  of  the  Government  by  an  equivalent  amount  thus  allowing  for  a \nhealthy flow of credit to the private sector.  \n \nSecuring  External  Financial  Assurance  for  the  Budget.  The  FY2010  budget \n93. \nenvisages Tk35 billion ($500 million) as special support/credit for development. The authorities \nexpect  to  secure  this  amount  from  development  partners  as  budget  support.  Discussions  are \nunderway with the World Bank although the availability of these resources will have to await the \nWorld Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) Joint Staff Assessment of the NSAPR-II (to be \nfinalized)  and  approval  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  country  assistance  strategy.  The  CSF  would  help \nthe authorities partly offset any potential shortfall in revenue and reduce Government\u2019s recourse \nto domestic bank financing. \n \n94. \nDebt  Sustainability.  As macroeconomic management in Bangladesh has always been \nprudent, the intended increase in borrowing under the CSF will not have any significant impact \non debt sustainability. The IMF's debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Bangladesh\u2019s \nprimary deficit has always been less than what is required for stabilizing public debt in relation to \nGDP and that performance is expected to hold in the future, pointing to a steady decline in the \ndebt-to-GDP  ratio  from  42.9%  in  FY2008  to  33%  by  FY2028.  These  conclusions  are  also \nsupported by the analysis done by ADB (Appendix 8) using assumptions broadly consistent with \nthose underlying the IMF's DSA. The proposed CSF financing will not have any adverse impact \non  the  overall  public  debt  level,  since  it  will  only  change  the  composition  of  public  debt.  The \nexternal  component  of  public  debt  will  go  up  by  $500  million,  while  the  domestic  borrowing \nrequirement and consequently domestic debt will be lower by an equivalent amount.  \n \n95. \nThe change in the composition of public debt in favor of external debt may also have a \nfavorable impact in two important ways. First, interest payments on external debt would be less \nthan  the  interest  payments  on  borrowing  from  domestic  sources  by  issuing  debt  of  equivalent \nmaturity.  The  interest  rate  on  5-year  domestic  debt  instruments  is  12.5%  while  the  rate  of \ninterest payable on CSF borrowing would at most be between 5\u20136% (assuming a 5-year swap \nrate).  Although  there  could  be  costs  associated  with  exchange  rate  movements,  the  spread \nbetween the domestic interest rate and the CSF borrowing rate is wide enough to make it much \nless  costly  to  borrow  from  ADB.  Second,  by  allowing  more  credit  to  flow  to  the  private  sector \nand  also  facilitating  capital  spending,  the  CSF  would  facilitate  more  effective  execution  of  the \ncountercyclical  development  program  and  thereby  boost  domestic  activity.  Such  positive \neconomic impacts would also enhance the public sector\u2019s capacity to service debt. \n \n96. \nServicing  of  external  debt,  however,  will  increase.  But  given  Bangladesh\u2019s  low  and \ndeclining external debt service ratio, comfortable and growing levels of official foreign exchange \nreserves  of  the  central  bank,  and  its  track  record  of  strong  balance  of  payments  positions \ncharacterized  by  both  external  current  account  and  overall  balance  of  payments  surplus \npositions, debt servicing should not be major cause for concern (Appendix 8).  \n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\f26 \n \n\nVI. \nIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS, BENEFITS AND IMPACT, AND RISKS AND \nSAFEGUARDS FOR THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROGRAM AND \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImplementation Arrangements46 \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nfor \n\nthe  executing  agency,  and  will  be  responsible \n\n97.  MOF  will  be \nthe  overall \nimplementation of the Program (the PESF and the CSF) including compliance with all policy \nactions and administration, disbursements, and maintenance of records. In principle, MOF will \nbe  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  activities,  report  implementation  progress,  and \nprovide guidance and direction to the implementing agencies. A joint secretary of the Finance \nDivision,  MOF,  will  act  as  the  program  director.  The  program  director  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  and  ensuring  that  the  work  of  the  executing  agency,  the  implementing  agencies, \nunder the guidance of the Program Steering Committee (PSC, para. 98) is carried out on time, \nso as to ensure Program implementation as scheduled.  \n \n98. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  (i)  Finance  Division  of  MOF;  (ii)  National  Board  of \nRevenue  under  MOF;  (iii)  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management;  (iv)  Ministry  of  Women \nand  Children  Affairs;  (v)  Local  Government  Division  of  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment,  and  Cooperatives;  (vi)  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of \nMinistry  of  Planning;  (vii)  Socioeconomic  Infrastructure  Division  of  the  Planning  Commission, \nMinistry  of  Planning;  (viii)  Roads  and  Railways  Division  of  Ministry  of  Communications;  (ix) \nPower Division and Energy and Mineral Resources Division of Ministry of Power, Energy, and \nMineral  Resources;  and  (x)  Ministry  of  Commerce.  Each  of  the  implementing  agencies  will  be \nresponsible  for  meeting  the  policy  actions  of  the  PESF  under  their  respective  implementing \nagencies. Since there are no policy actions for the CSF, the implementing agencies will function \nand provide support for the purpose of monitoring expenditures financed by the CSF. \n \n99. \nThe PSC for the Program will be formed and will be chaired by the secretary, Finance \nDivision, MOF. The members will include representatives not below the rank of joint secretary \nfrom  each  of  the  implementing  agencies  and  the  joint  secretary  of  the  Economic  Relations \nDivision. The PSC will be responsible for providing overall direction, guidance, monitoring, and \noversight  under  the  Program.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  discuss  the \nprogress of the PESF and review macroeconomic conditions to ensure continued stability.   \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n100.  The PESF will be released in two tranches and the CSF in a single tranche upon loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, no \nmore  than  180  days  before  the  effectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of \nineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are \nexcluded.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation  will  be  required  if  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \ndisbursed,  the  value  of  Bangladesh  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \n\n                                                 \n46 See Supplementary Appendix I for further details on the implementation arrangements. \n\n\fineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures  will be required. Disbursements will be made \nunder  the  simplified  procedures  for  program  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services \nproduced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and \nnormal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the \ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n101.  The  local  currency  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  PESF  will  be  used  to  finance \nadjustment costs under the PESF, including (i) delivery of scaled up SSNPs, (ii) strengthening \nof the funding and implementation of PPPs, and enhancement of access to credit for SMEs and \nthe  housing  sector,  and  (iii)  revenue  mobilization  measures,  reforms  in  PFM  processes,  and \napplication  of  the  MTBF.  The  CSF  will  supplement  the  PESF  by  funding  additional  SSNPs \n(Appendix  3,  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B),  including  for  returning  migrants,  unemployed \nyouth, stipends to keep students in school, pensions, public works in disaster-prone areas, and \nfood-based assistance. Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides  breakdown  of  support  for  SSNPs \nthrough the PESF and the CSF. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n\n102.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n103.  As  part  of  preparation  for  the  Program,  a  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted \nalong the lines prescribed by the implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan (Supplementary Appendix H). A close review of the PFM and other systems shows \nthe following areas that are of particular concern: \n \n\nWeak  institutional  capacity.  In  order  for  the  Program  to  succeed,  it  is \nimperative that relevant institutions are strengthened.  \n\nNon-sustainability of policy reforms. There should be continuous engagement \nwith the Government and other relevant stakeholders on the reform measures to \nensure  appropriate  buy-in  and  ongoing  commitment.  Civil  society  and  other \ndevelopment partners should be consulted as part of this on-going process. \n\n(iii) \n\nMismanagement  of  resources  in  the  public  sector.  Adequate  auditing \nprovisions, and a fully functional and effective Ombudsman office, supported by a \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\nconstantly  vigilant  media  and  civil  society,  would  lessen  mismanagement  in  the \npublic  sector.  Close  performance  monitoring  will  also  be  necessary  to  help \nreduce the negative effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints.  \n\n \n(iv)  Weak  coordination. The MOF will have to play a much stronger role to ensure \nproper  coordination  across  government  departments,  particularly  in  light  of  the \nfocus on implementation of the MTBF under the PESF. \n\n \n(v) \n\nFiduciary risks. Quarterly reporting arrangements are built into the Program.  \n\n \n104.  The  success  of  the  Program  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  strong \ncommitment to governance reforms in general and, more specifically, to successfully countering \nendemic  and  widespread  corruption.  There  is  a  risk  that  recently  initiated  reforms  may  be \nreversed; this risk may be mitigated by continued policy dialogue, not only with the Government \nbut also with other stakeholders. The ongoing ADB-funded Good Governance Program provides \nadequate  support  to  all  levels  of  Government  to  ensure  that  mismanagement  of  resources  is \nmore effectively addressed. It has also set aside resources for capacity building to ensure that \ngovernment  agencies  are  building  the  relevant  capacity  for  grievance  handling  and  service \ndelivery feedback.47  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n105.  The Government will maintain separate records of accounts for the Program (PESF and \nCSF).  To  ensure  proper  fund  management,  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program \nloan  proceeds.  The  accounts  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nterms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  For  the  PESF,  the  Finance  Division,  MOF,  will  prepare  a  quarterly \nconsolidated progress report on policy and institutional reforms implementation and will forward \nthe same to ADB at the time of submission to the PSC. The reports will describe progress made \nin  the  PESF  and  any  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  and  will  also  identify  any \nproblems  encountered  and  remedial  actions  taken.  Not  later  than  3  months  after  PESF \ncompletion,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  a  PESF  completion  report,  including  an \nassessment of overall PESF performance.  \n \n106.  For the CSF, the Finance Division, MOF, will maintain all monitoring data and evaluate \nthe benefits of the CSF, and will also submit a semiannual progress report to ADB that reviews \nthe  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  conditions.  Within  three  months  after  the  CSF  completion,  the \nGovernment will provide ADB with a CSF completion report that includes an assessment of the \nextent of progress and the impact of actions under the CSF. \n \n\n6. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n107.  The  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  set  of  indicators  and  targets  that  will  be \nused  to  assess  progress  toward  meeting  the  objectives  of  the  Program.  MOF  shall  be \nresponsible  for  maintaining  all  monitoring  data  and  evaluating  benefits.  The  PSC  will  monitor \nimplementation and outcomes of the core components as follows: \n \n\n                                                 \n47 The ADB-funded ongoing Good Governance Program (footnotes 17 and 34) makes provision of approximately $15 \nmillion for 2009 and 2010 to build the capacity of sector agencies as well as local authorities for implementation of \nthe  National  Integrity  Strategy,  a  key  part  of  which  is  supporting  application  of  the  Right  to  Information  Act, \nanticorruption-related reforms, and strengthening grievance-handling mechanisms. \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMacroeconomic and fiscal monitoring will be based on data from the Bangladesh \nBureau  of  Statistics,  MOF,  the  Planning  Commission  and  Bangladesh  Bank,  as \nwell as data from the IMF.  \nTo monitor progress in enhancing the provision of safety nets and empowerment \nprograms for the poor and vulnerable, the PSC and ADB will rely on SSNP data \nrecorded  by  local  administrations  and  agencies;  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare; \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives; Ministry of \nFood  and  Disaster  Management;  and  MOF,  as  well  as  quantitative  and \nqualitative \nfrom  development  partners,  civil  society \norganizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  active  in  this  area\u2014when \navailable,  data  from  the  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  conducted \nafter  2005,  and  gender-disaggregated  data  from  existing  gender  budgets,  will \nalso be used.  \nMOF,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Bangladesh  Bank,  and  Federation  of  Bangladesh \nChambers of Commerce and Industry will be the primary sources of information \nto  monitor  progress  in  putting  in  place  the  necessary  PPP  framework  and  in \naccelerating implementation of public infrastructure projects under the ADP and \nPPP; information from IMF will also be consulted.  \n\ninformation  available \n\n \n108.  For  each  of  these  indicators,  progress  will  be  measured  against  a  baseline  in  FY2009 \n(Appendix  1  and  Appendix  2).  The  responsible  line  ministries  working  in  these  sectors  will \nreview  these  frameworks  every  three  months  to  determine  progress  and  identify  constraints. \nThe  executing  agency  will  have  the  primary  responsibility  for  monitoring  implementation  and \noutcomes  and  assessing  the  status  of  reforms.  It  will  closely  coordinate  the  monitoring  of \nreforms  in  social  protection,  private  sector  investment,  and  PFM  with  development  partners \nworking  in  these  areas  through  regular  reviews;  and  it  will  report  to  ADB  on  the  status  of  the \nProgram  targets  and  indicators.  ADB  will  also  review  progress  in  implementation  of  reforms \nthrough review missions, in consultation with other development partners, as needed. A detailed \ndescription of the monitoring arrangements is in Appendix 10. \n \n109.  Program  reviews  will  be  undertaken  on  a  continuing  basis.  MOF  will  conduct  joint \nquarterly meetings with the PSC and the implementing agencies to review progress. MOF will, \nas  needed,  hold  consultative  meetings  with  the  private  sector  and  development  partners  to \nsolicit  their  feedback  on  emerging  policies  and  on  the  impact  of  the  Program.  A  review  of  the \nPESF will also take place prior to the scheduled release of the second tranche. This review will, \namong  others,  (i)  assess  implementation  performance  against  the  tranche  release  conditions \nand covenants; and (ii) identify relevant problems and constraints. If the reviews determine that \nchanges are required, the Government and ADB will agree on measures, including changes in \nimplementation arrangements, to ensure that the Program obligations are met. \n \n110.  The PSC and ADB shall jointly conduct semi-annual reviews of the macroeconomic and \nfiscal  conditions  of  the  economy  and  assess  the  impact  and  evaluate  the  benefits  of  actions \nunder  the  CSF  on  the  real  economy  and  the  social  sectors,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nperformance  management  review  requirements.  MOF  shall  be  responsible  for  maintaining  all \nmonitoring  data  and  evaluating  the  benefits  of  the  CSF.  Within  three  months  after  the  CSF \nperiod, MOF, with the support of the implementing agencies will submit a CSF completion report \nto ADB that assesses the extent of progress under the CSF. The economics, governance, and \nportfolio  management  units  at  the  ADB  resident  mission  will  continue  to  closely  monitor \nmacroeconomic  performance,  status  of  reforms,  and  the  impact  of  the  measures  taken  even \nafter Program completion.  \n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n\f30 \n \n\nB. \n\nExpected Benefits and Impact \n\n111.  The  Program  will  provide  financing  for  scaling  up  SSNPs  and  will  support  reforms  to \nimplement the SSNPs more effectively through better targeting. Regardless of the global crisis, \nexpanding the coverage of SSNPs and improving targeting would have been critical to prevent \nthe  hardcore  poor  and  most  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population,  especially  women  and \npeople  living  in  disaster-prone  areas,  from  falling  more  deeply  into  poverty.  As  a  result  of \nreforms  supported  by  the  Program,  the  poor  will  be  empowered  to  claim  and  receive  the \nbenefits they are entitled to, because of enhanced access to information and oversight. Training \nand microcredit schemes (such as that provided through the Palli Karma Shahayok Foundation) \nwill  also  help  improve  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  immediate  benefit  from  these \nwill  be  to  safeguard  the  gains  in  economic  and  social  welfare  in  a  very  poor  country.  The \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \n112. \nIn the context of the economic slowdown and lower revenue collection, the Program will \nprovide additional resources to help expand SSNPs so as to also cover people previously non \npoor  who  are  hurt  by  the  crisis,  such  as  households  highly  dependent on  remittances, laid  off \nexpatriate  and  factory  workers  in  affected  export  sectors,  women  forced  into  low-paying  and \ninsecure jobs, as well as the large number of young people joining the labor market at a time of \nshrinking job opportunities. The SSNPs will make it possible for poor, including female-headed \nhouseholds,  to  preserve  adequate  food  intake  through  various  food  relief  schemes,  and  to \ninvest in their children's education with the help of stipends for primary, secondary, and drop-out \nstudents. Thanks to uninterrupted pension payments, poor pensioners will be able to continue \nsustaining  their  families.  The  'Skill  Development  Fund  for  Expatriate  Returnees  and  New \nEntrants  to  the  Labor  Market',  as  well  as  the  'Ghare  Fera  (Returning  Home)  Program'  will \nfacilitate \nthe  economic  and  social  reinsertion  of  migrant  workers.  Rural  employment \nopportunities  will  also  help  absorb  some  of  the  excess  labor  force  and  ensure  a  minimum \nlivelihood to people with no other resources.  \n \n113. \nIn  addition  to  the  direct  benefit  for  the  poor,  the  Program  will  create  fiscal  space  to \nenable  the  Government  to  finance  scaled  up  infrastructure  investment  and  a  fiscal  stimulus \npackage. These additional expenditures will help reduce the risk of unemployment and income \nloss  in  the  immediate  term,  and  also  enhance  longer-term  growth  prospects  without \ncompromising  macroeconomic  stability  or  crowding  out  private  investment.  Moreover,  the \nbenefits  from  the  structural  reforms  supported  under  the  PESF  will  be  felt  in  the  medium  and \nlong term by helping to remove institutional impediments to higher private sector participation in \ninfrastructure investment.  \n \n114.  Successful PPPs in infrastructure and social sectors, over the medium- to long-term will \nenable  Government  to  expand  the  level  of  social  expenditures  and  broaden  management \ncapacity for infrastructure projects. In the short run, a key benefit from scaled up investment in \ninfrastructure  will  be  job  creation,  which  will  help  absorb  the  large  labor  force,  preserve \nlivelihoods  and  sustain  demand  at  a  time  of  collapsing  income-earning  opportunities  at  the \nglobal  level.  These  investments  will  also  build  potential  for  more  rapid  growth  in  the  medium \nterm. SMEs would receive adequate support, thus helping to contribute to more inclusive growth.  \n \n115.  The  results  from  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  will  feed  into  the \nplanning  and  budgeting  process.  The  Public  Accounts  Committee  will  use  the  audit  results  to \nensure accountability on public spending and control irregularities. Internal and external control \nmeasures and oversight will have been put in place to reduce the scope for corruption.  \n \n\n\fC. \n\nProgram Risks and Safeguards \n\n116.  Risks.  Success  of \nthe  Program  depends  on  Government's  continuing  strong \ncommitment to the economic reform agenda as demonstrated in the FY2010 budget. Some of \nthe risks include (i) continuation of the global crisis and its impact on the Bangladesh economy \nthat would accentuate the risk of the budget deficit exceeding 5% of GDP\u2014this would lead to \ncorrespondingly  higher  borrowing  requirement,  which  would  seriously  limit  the  availability  of \ncredit for the private sector and could compromise macroeconomic stability, (ii) a further decline \nin remittances, which would reduce livelihoods for many rural households heavily dependent on \nsuch income, (iii) lack of targeted focus on capacity enhancement in Government to implement \nthe economic reform agenda, (iv) leakages, poor targeting, and corruption that could reduce the \neffectiveness of expenditures through mismanagement of resources, weak business processes, \nand  weak  internal  accountability  in  the  system,  (v)  reduced  focus  on  the  enabling  conditions \n(such  as  appropriate  legal  and  policy  framework)  for  reform  efforts  such  as  on  PPPs,  and  (vi) \nineffective service delivery as a result of low capacity at the local level. \n \n117.  Mitigation  Measures.  The  countercyclical  development  program  to  support  affected \nsectors will reduce the risk of job shedding, and broaden access to credit for SMEs and women \nentrepreneurs. SSNPs targeting people with low income and no assets will provide protection in \nthe event of a further decline in remittances. Actions taken under the PESF to enhance access \nto information and to strengthen the representation of the poor and vulnerable groups will help \nmitigate some of the concerns regarding possible leakage, mismanagement, or corruption. Line \nministries,  being  instructed  to  advance  the  preparation  of  project  approval  and  procurement \ndocuments  in  FY2010  and  their  performance  being  monitored  more  closely,  should  help \naccelerate  actual  investment  spending.  Additional  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks  include  (i) \nring-fencing of specific PESF-supported reforms so that Government commitment to fund them \nis  maintained,  (ii)  targeted  capacity  building  by  Government  for  specific  areas  of  PESF  focus, \nand (iii) continued engagement with Government on governance reform measures, such as that \ncurrently in place.  \n \n118.  Safeguards.    The  Program  has  been  reviewed  for  its  impact  on  the  various  relevant \nADB  and  Government  safeguards,  and  no  adverse  impact  is  expected  on  the  environment, \nresettlement, or indigenous population as a result of the policy interventions. For all three areas, \nthe Program is rated a category C. \n \n\nVII. \n\n ASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n119.  For the PESF, in addition to the standard assurances, the Government will be requested \nto give the following specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the Loan Agreements: \n \n\nThe Government will (a) ensure that all policies adopted and actions taken under \nthe PESF, as set forth in the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will continue to \nbe in effect for and beyond the duration of the PESF, and (b) promptly adopt and \nimplement the policies and actions included in the Program PESF set forth in the \nPolicy Letter and the policy Matrix. \n\nThe  Government  will  give  due  consideration \nfindings  and \nrecommendations  proposed  as  a  result  of  the  PESF  while  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions under the PESF. \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n31 \n\n \n\n\f32 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of, and the Government and ADB will \nfrom  time  to  time  exchange  views  on,  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix and in the \nformulation and implementation of new related policies. \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  promptly  discuss  problems  and  constraints \nencountered  during  the  implementation  of  the  PESF  and  appropriate  measures \nto overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  PESF  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  into \naccount ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  are  used  to  finance  the \nlocal currency cost relating to the implementation of the PESF and other activities \nconsistent with the objectives of the PESF and will provide the necessary budget \nthe \nappropriation \nimplementation  of  reforms  under  the  PESF,  including  (a)  revenue  mobilization \nmeasures, reforming financial management processes, and application of MTBF, \n(b)  strengthening  the  funding  and  implementation  of  PPPs,  and  (c)  delivery  of \nsocial safety nets. \n\nthe  structural  adjustment  costs  relating \n\nfinance \n\nto \n\nto \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  periodic \nthe  PESF \nimplementation  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress \nand  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  PESF.

Chief among the impacts has been the slide of \nmillions of vulnerable people (paras 2 and 3) towards greater poverty in a country where nearly \n40% of the population are already below the poverty line.2 Concerned at this development, the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (the Government) is aware that (i) on the one hand, it is vital that \nthe short-term impacts of the crisis on vulnerable people be immediately addressed; and (ii) in \nthe  medium-  to  long-  term,  it  is  important  that  measures  be  in  place  to  improve  the  public \nfinancial  and  expenditure  management  system,  and  make  the  investment  climate  more \nconducive for the private sector to augment public sector investments. The Public Expenditure \nSupport Facility (PESF) Program is aligned with these specific measures taken by Government.  \n \nB. \n\nDefinition of Vulnerable People  \n\n \n\n2. \nWhile  data  limitations  do  not  allow  measuring  the  extent  of  vulnerability,  poverty  and \nvulnerability  are  often  closely  linked,  with  the  poor  being  the  most  vulnerable  to  falling  into \ndeeper  poverty  as  a  result  of  life  cycle  and  aggregate  climatic  shocks.  Poor  households  have \nlimited human and physical assets, and shocks to individual members (e.g., illness, loss of job) \nor the community (e.g., floods) force them into ineffective risk coping strategies (child labor, sale \nof productive assets, informal lenders) that push them deeper into poverty. \n \nThe groups particularly vulnerable to risks include: (i) infants and children that face the \n3. \nrisk  of  poverty,  malnutrition,  low  human  capital  accumulation,  and  exploitation  in  the  labor \nforce; 3 (ii)  working  age  adults  that  face  the  risk  of  unemployment  and  low  productivity;  (iii) \nelderly  adults  that  lack  adequate  safety  nets;  (iv)  special  and  excluded  groups  that  need \nassistance;4 and  (v)  a  majority  of  the  women  who  have  very  limited  access  to  empowerment \nand productive employment opportunities. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Safety Net Programs  \n\n4. \nBangladesh relies on a range of informal and formal instruments to mitigate the risk of \nvulnerable populations falling into poverty, and to help them cope with poverty. The Government \nhas  initiated  numerous  social  safety  net  programs  (SSNPs), 5  including  safety  nets,  social \ninsurance  (e.g.,  pensions,  unemployment  benefits),  and  labor  market  policies/programs  to  (i) \n                                                 \n1   For  purposes  of  the  PESF,  the  term  sector  refers  to  the  public  expenditure  domain,  particularly,  public  financial \nmanagement  (including  public  sector  efficiency  and  revenue  mobilization,  and  financial  and  fiscal  management), \nprivate  sector  development,  and  service  delivery  in  the  domain  of  SSNPs.  These  three  are  inter-related  sub-\ncomponents of the PESF. \n\n2   Poverty  line  constructed  using  the  cost-of-basic  needs  method  represent  the  level  of  per  capita  expenditure  at \nwhich  the  members  of  a  household  can  be  expected  to  meet  their  basic  food  calorie  requirement  (2,122  kilo \ncalories per day per person) and also non-food consumption.    \n\n3  Over 60% of households in Bangladesh with multiple children are poor. Access to education is still inequitable with \nonly 24% of expenditures at the secondary level, and only 17% of expenditures at the tertiary level accruing to the \npoor. About 20% of children aged 5-17 years are working and over four-fifths of these come from poor households. \nMalnutrition remains a serious concern, with nearly half of all children under 6 years of age being underweight or \nstunted.  \n\n4   Special  categories  include  the  disabled,  widowed  women,  hill  tribes,  and  other  minorities  and  groups  that  are \namong the poorest and most marginalized in Bangladesh. Hill tribes, for example, constitute only about 1% of the \npopulation, but their needs are extreme. \n\n5  Further details on SSNPs are in Table A3 and Supplementary Appendix B.  \n\n \n\n\f44      Appendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nhelp the poor and those vulnerable to cope with shocks to their incomes and livelihoods; (ii) help \nworkers  retrenched  during  industrial  restructuring,  including  by  providing  access  to  credit;  and \n(iii) strengthen disaster prevention and mitigation strategies. Income transfers from SSNPs have \nalso  played  an  important  role  in  protecting  and  expanding  asset  bases  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.  Notwithstanding  these,  the  SSNPs  face  several  challenges  including  coverage, \nleakages,  targeting,  and  oversight  opportunities.  The  PESF  aims  to  address  some  of  these \naspects  in  a  substantive  manner.  In  addition,  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  Support \nProgram facilitates the scaling up of the SSNPs and frees up fiscal space for other areas of the \nGovernment's countercyclical development program.  \n\n \nCoverage. Increasing the coverage of the SSNPs is a major challenge.6 As a result, the \n5. \ncoverage  of  food  security,  a  primary  element  in  the  SSNPs,  is  considered  inadequate.  The \nexpansion of SSNPs for mitigating the adverse impacts of natural disasters and external price \nshocks on the food security of vulnerable populations is constrained by limited fiscal space and \nalso by weak institutional capacities of the relevant government agencies. \n \nLeakage. 7  Leakage  in  SSNPs  and  the  service  delivery  system  is  also  a  serious \n6. \nchallenge in Bangladesh. Minimizing the number of intermediaries in service delivery, realigning \nincentives for more efficient service delivery, and making the decisions of intermediaries more \ntransparent  are  some  solutions.  Given  that  leakage  and  misallocation  problems  may  go \nundetected  for  long  periods  of  time  if  monitoring  and  management  capacity  are  inadequate, \nputting greater emphasis on monitoring capacity within line agencies is critical. There is a need \nfor digitization and greater use of information technology to make SSNPs more effective.  \n\n \n\nTargeting.  While  the  new  SSNPs  introduced  in  the  FY2010  budget  (Table  A3)  will \n7. \ncertainly help address the adverse impacts of the global crisis, there is an equally pressing need \nfor  enhancing  targeting  of  SSNPs  for  maximizing  their  impact.  SSNPs  can  be  made  more \neffective  by  improving  targeting  criteria,8 for  which  it  will  be  necessary  to  target  households \nusing  criteria  that  are  more  closely  related  to  occupation  and  income  than  to  assets  such  as \nland. At a systemic level, the Government will need to put in place stronger gender budgeting \nguidelines for greater accountability of the share of expenditure for women development.  \n \nOversight Opportunities. In order to strengthen gender targeting and for more effective \n8. \nservice  delivery,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  oversight  opportunities  are  available  to  the \nvulnerable  people  that  access  SSNPs  to  ensure  that  service  provision  is  being  done  in  a \ntransparent and accountable manner. In this regard, legislative measures such as the Right to \n\n                                                 \n6  Although the number of beneficiaries covered under SSNPs looks high from Government records, it may be noted \n\nthat the same beneficiary could be included in separate programs and counted more than once. \n\n7  Leakage is manifested by a gap between the value of a good or a service delivered and a reasonable cost of the \nitem  for  the  producer  and  the  service  provider.  Leakage  could  be  the  result  of  a  technical  loss,  weak  financial \nmanagement, theft, and/or corruption.  \n\n8   To  facilitate  better  targeting,  it  is  necessary  first  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  list  of  the  hardcore  poor  and  other \nvulnerable populations. At the moment, the Government does not have the complete picture of the true variance \nbetween  those  in  need  of  the  coverage  and  those  that  are  actually  accessing  the  SSNPs.  This  gap  in  service \ndelivery is serious, and requires that the Government take a concerted approach to prepare an operational plan to \ncollect the necessary information from all the districts and sub-districts. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\nPublic-Private Partnerships  \n\nInformation  Act,  and  the  Consumers'  Right  Protection  Act  need  to  be  operationalized.  Also \nuseful will be application of the citizen's charter in public sector organizations.9  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe  second  critical  element  of  the  sector,  and  one  that  is  substantively  related  to  the \nfirst,10 has  to  do  with  the  manner  in  which  the  Government  is  able  to  focus  on  the more  long-\nterm requirement of infrastructure development for fostering economic growth. Over the last few \nyears, public investment in infrastructure in Bangladesh has remained stagnant at under 5% of \nthe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Persistent  neglect  of  public  infrastructure  services  has \nhampered  domestic  economic  growth  and  restrained  Bangladesh  from  living  up  to  its  full \npotential  from  a  regional  standpoint  of  being  able  to  assume  the  role  of  a  transport  and \ntransshipment hub for the subregion. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure limits the country\u2019s \nopportunities for integrating economically with its neighbors.  \n \n10. \nAs  is  the  case  in  most  of  South  Asia,  the  public  sector  has  been  the  main  provider  of \nbasic infrastructure in Bangladesh. However, public financing alone will not be able to generate \nthe  investments  needed  to  provide  the  required  level  of  infrastructure  facilities.  Aware  of  this \nlimitation, the Government agencies\u23afInfrastructure Development Company Limited, Investment \nPromotion  and  Financing  Facility,  and  Infrastructure  Investment  Facilitation  Center\u23afare \nengaged in enhancing private sector investments in infrastructure services.  \n \n11. \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment  still  faces  formidable  challenges.  While  earnest  efforts  have  been  made  to \nupgrade the existing public\u2013private partnership (PPP)11 guidelines, no detailed PPP framework \nhas emerged so far. Gaps in technical and management capabilities and in identifying market \nopportunities  also  severely  impede  the  potential  for  PPPs.  Even  though  the  Private  Sector \nInfrastructure  Guidelines  (PSIG)  issued  in  2004  are  the  basis  for  implementation  of  PPP \nprojects,  there  is  lack  of  clarity  and  consistency  between  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations \nand PSIG. Mobilizing finance for private investment in infrastructure is also a major challenge in \nthe absence of a well-developed domestic capital market.  \n \nRealizing  its  role  in  catalyzing  infrastructure  development 12  the  Government  in  its \n12. \nFY2010 budget has taken a comprehensive approach13 for mainstreaming PPPs, which include:  \n\nlimited  success,  significant  scaling  up  of \n\nNotwithstanding  some \n\n \n(i) \n\nPPP Cell for coordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide;  \n\n                                                 \n9 Citizen's  charters  allow  the  service  recipients  to  be  not  only  aware  of  their  entitlements  but  also  of  their  rights  in \naccessing those entitlements. Where such tools have been used effectively, they have been powerful tools to give \nservice  recipients  greater  voice  in  the  service  delivery  process.  Such  tools,  however,  have  to  be  applied  in \nconjunction  with  legislative  measures  such  as  the  right  to  information  so  that  lapses  in  service  delivery  can  be \neffectively reported and corrective action taken by service providers. \n\n10 Largely through better access to health facilities, job opportunities, and market outlets.  \n11 PPP projects are typically projects developed, implemented, and operated by bidders (stand-alone special purpose \nvehicles). Further, these projects are selected on the basis of a competitive and transparent bidding arrangement \nand are expected to be build-and-operate infrastructure based on a concession arrangement with the Government.  \n12 The Government has reviewed and drawn lessons from ADB's ongoing support for mainstreaming PPPs in India. \nADB.  2006.

The Government will also revise and reissue the 2004 PSIG to place a strong legal \nand  institutional  framework  for  PPPs.  The  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms,  especially  on \nimproving money and debt markets, are also being pursued to ease financing constraints. While \nthe measures taken by the Government reflect its intent to usher in private sector investment in \ndelivery  of  infrastructure,  the  convergence  of  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  aspects  for \nmainstreaming  PPPs  is  a  medium  to  long-term  process.  Accordingly,  further  assistance \nespecially for strengthening capacity building14 would be considered by ADB on the completion \nof the PPP reforms initiated under the PESF.  \n \nE. \n\nPublic Financial Management  \n\n14. \nEfficient and accountable public financial management (PFM) and financial management \ninstitutions  are  key  elements  of  good  governance.  Sound  public  financial  management \nencompasses  four  broad  elements:  (i)  maintenance  of  sound  fiscal  policies,  (ii)  allocation  of \nresources  in  accordance  with  the  stated  policies  and  priorities  of  government,  (iii)  appropriate \nuse  of  budgeted  funds  and  assets,  and  (iv)  adherence  to  internationally  accepted  accounting \nand  auditing  standards  and  firm  internal  control  measures.  While  Bangladesh  has  achieved  a \nsustainable fiscal balance and low budget deficit, there is need for improving coordination and \nefficiency in the three other financial management elements.   \n \nIn light of the global crisis and its short- and medium-term impacts on the economy, the \n15. \nGovernment  realizes  that  there  is  need  to  ensure  strong  PFM  as  well  as  efficient  public \nexpenditure  management  systems.  Towards  this  end,  several  specific  areas  of  reforms  are \nbeing  targeted  under  the  PESF  including  (i)  public  sector  efficiency  and  revenue  mobilization, \n(ii) accounting, auditing, and project approval process, and (iii) wider application of the medium-\nterm budgetary framework (MTBF). \n \n16. \nEfficiencies  and  Revenue  Mobilization.  For  enlarging  the  fiscal  space,  and  making \nmore resources available for public investment in infrastructure and human capital development \nmeasures  need  to  be  stepped  up  to  increase  the  public  resource  envelop  not  only  by \nstrengthening  the  tax  system  but  also  by  improving  efficiencies  in  the  public  sector.  The \nGovernment  can,  through  corporatization  and  divestiture,  reduce  its  expenditure  burden  (thus \nfreeing  up  resources  to  be  channeled  for  investments  and  for  SSNPs).  To  this  end,  the \nGovernment  can  use  measures  that  are  legislative  (such  as  amendments  to  the  Income  Tax \nOrdinance),  or  institutional  (such  as  reconstituting  companies  under  the  Company  Act,  or \n\n                                                 \n14   Capacity  development  for  refining  the  PPP  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  meeting  compliance/public  safety \nnorms;  improving  information;  improving  bidding  documents  and  procedures;  determining  risk  sharing;  and \ndetermining  adequate  monitoring  arrangements.  ADB's  ongoing  support  for  financing  infrastructure  projects \nincluding  PPPs  is  also  providing  capacity  building  support  for  developing  PPP  framework  and  guidelines.  ADB. \n2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\ndivesting  shares  from  state-owned  enterprises).  Government  also  has  plans  to  expand  the \nincome  tax  base  by  identifying  new  taxpayers  through  relevant  surveys  covering  areas  in \ndistricts and cities that are still outside the income tax net, and expanding the tax net to Upazila \n(subdistrict levels). \n \n17. \nA stronger revenue administration is critically important for raising revenue significantly. \nThe National Board of Revenue (NBR), which collects direct and indirect taxes (accounting for \naround 95% of tax revenues), has over the years sought to modernize and attract skilled staff, \nand carry out its statutory functions. Yet, past reform programs have not fully addressed all the \nareas  needing  improvement  and  modernization.  The  business  community  generally  feels  that \ntax administration needs to be improved to make it more responsive to business needs, ensure \nmore  stable  tax  policies  and  more  consistent  and  uniform  application  of  tax  laws.  Tax \nregulations  also  need  to  be  modernized  in  step  with  the  changing  needs  and  practices \nworldwide.  \n \n18. \nPublic Sector Accounting and Fiscal Reporting.  Public  sector  accounting  standards \nand  practices  in  Bangladesh  need  to  be  updated.  The  Government  follows  a  cash-based \naccounting  standard  (rather  than  an  accrual-based  system)  that  recognizes  expenses  only \nwhen  actual  cash  is  paid  rather  than  when  commitment  of  resources  is  made.  The  practice \nunderestimates future expenses in the present fiscal year and complicates the budgeting process. \nAccuracy  of  government  accounts  also  need  to  be  enhanced  by  ensuring  greater  consistency \nbetween  bank  balances  shown  in  the  government  balance  sheet  and  those  reflected  in \nBangladesh  Bank  statements.  Control  mechanisms  need  to  be  strengthened  to  prevent \nmisclassification  of  public  expenditure  accounts,  and  any  concealment  of  misappropriation  of \nresources.  Foreign-assisted  expenditure  also  needs  to  be  properly  reflected  in  the  consolidated \nmonthly accounts, to ensure accuracy of the information on public expenditure.  \n \n19.  Monthly  financial  reports  showing  actual  expenditures  against  the  budgeted  levels  are \nproduced within five weeks after the end of each month. Although all significant expenditures of \nthe central government are included in the fiscal reports, fiscal reporting remains incomplete as \nthe  expenditures  of  the  local  government  and  state-owned  enterprises  are  not  incorporated. \nAnnual  Finance  Accounts  of  the  government  are  also  submitted  with  considerable  time  lag, \nmore  than  12  months  after  the  close  of  the  financial  year.  While  the  Government  generates \ninformation on its contingent liabilities, the lack of comprehensiveness in the report on liabilities \nindicates  a  low  reliability  of  fiscal  reporting.  Finally,  approval  and  reporting  processes  for \ndevelopment projects are lengthy and complex, which has jeopardized the pace of completion \nof the Annual Development Program (ADP). \n \n20. \nBudget  Preparation  and  Execution.  While  the  Government  has  put  in  place  a  MTBF \n(which  has  been adopted in 20 of the 42 government  ministries/divisions, covering 53% of total \nbudget and 86% of ADP), application of the MTBF needs to be made uniform across the public \nsector. Also important is to institute the budgeting process in the 64 districts of the country. Given \nthat  Bangladesh  does  not  have  a  federal  form  of  government,  much  of  the  impetus  in  the \neconomic and fiscal realms stems from the center. As service delivery needs to be delegated to \nthe  local  levels,  if  it  is  to  be  effective  and  efficient,  there  is  a  corresponding  need  to  strengthen \ndistrict  budgeting  processes,  which  will  also  ensure  transparency  of  public  expenditure  and \ngreater accountability in program implementation. The Government is contemplating the first step \nin this regard, by preparing a district budget for one district in each administrative division of the \ncountry in the national budget for FY2011. \n \n\n \n\n\f48      Appendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo improve the effectiveness of application of the MTBF across public sector agencies, \n21. \nthe  capability  of  the  agencies  that  are  currently  implementing  it  needs  to  be  enhanced.  The \npractice  of  rotating  staff  in  the  administration,  particularly  at  the  senior  level,  also  needs  to be \nrationalized for facilitating efficient mainstreaming of the MTBF within the agencies. This will be \nessential  to  achieve  a  sustainable  MTBF  process  that  can  contribute  effectively  to  the \nrealization of improved budget outcomes. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n49 \n\nCost of SSNPs \n($ million) \n\nTable A3: Social Safety Net Programs \n\nNumber of Beneficiaries \n\nName of Programs \n\n(\u2018000 person) \n\nFY2010a \n\nFY 2009 \n \n \n\n(\u2018000 person-months) \nFY2010a \n \n \n \n\nFY 2009 \n \n \n \n\nFY2009 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n4,265 \n25 \n \n \n990 \n \n \n46,717 \n \n \n6,068 \n \n \n483 \n0 \n0 \n \n \n11,063 \n \n\nRunning Programs \n \nCash Transfer (Allowances) Programs \n  Social Protectionb \n  Social Empowermentc \n \nCash Transfer (Special) Programs \n  Social Empowerment \n \nFood Security Programs \n  Social Protection \n \nMicro-Credit Programs \n  Social Empowerment \n \nMiscellaneous Funds \n  Social Empowerment \n  Social Protection \n \n \nDevelopment Sector Programs \n  Social Empowerment  \n \nNew Programs \n \nSocial Protection \n \n \nDevelopment Sector Programs \n  Social Empowerment \n \nTotal running and new SSNPs \n  % Increase \n  % of Total Budget \n  % of Gross Domestic Product \na Budget  \nb  Social protection programs guarantee the availability of resources (in cash or in kind) to cover basic food requirements and other needs.  \n\n0 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n22,864 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n0 \n3,127 \n3,087 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n \n0 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n25,991 \n \n \n \n\n0 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n22,617 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n0 \n40 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n \n \n6,361 \n4,900 \n \n \n0 \n \n28,718 \n\n4,643 \n28 \n \n \n2,850 \n \n \n66,667 \n \n \n6,500 \n \n \n204 \n0 \n0 \n \n \n12,734 \n\n698 \n1 \n \n \n7 \n \n \n765 \n \n \n44 \n \n \n31 \n182 \n134 \n \n \n277 \n \n \n \n0 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n2,005 \n\n \n0 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n \n69,611 \n \n \n \n\nof which Employment Generation Program for the Hardcore Poor \n\n   of which 100 days Employment Schemed \n\n0 \n0 \n \n \n210 \n \n93,836 \n\n34.8% \n \n \n\n10.5% \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n       c Social empowerment programs provide the means to make a better living through education, training, access to microfinance, etc.  \n\nd Discontinued in FY2010 \n \nSSNP = Social Safety Net Program. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Government of Bangladesh; and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nFY2010 \n \n \n \n782 \n1 \n \n \n9 \n \n \n851 \n \n \n72 \n \n \n16 \n197 \n0 \n \n \n335 \n \n \n \n244 \n170 \n \n \n2 \n \n2,509 \n\n \n14.7% \n2.3% \n\n25.2% \n15.2% \n2.5% \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n \n\n4\n9\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\nBangladesh has had considerable support from development partners in the broad areas \n\n \n1. \nof social safety net programs, improving the investment climate, and public expenditure reform. \n \n\nTable A4: Development Partners' Work on Program-Related Areas \n \nAreas of Coverage/Objectives \n\nFinancial and Other \nInformation \n\nArea of Program/Project \u2013 \nDevelopment Partner \n \nA.

Bangladesh\u2019s external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant \nindicative thresholds established under the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2212World Bank debt \nsustainability  analysis  (DSA)  framework.  Debt  burden  indicators  are  somewhat  worse  when \ndomestic debt is included in the analysis, in part because of higher interest rates on such debt.   \n \n2. \nBox  A8  summarizes  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  framework  underlying  the  DSA \nexercise.  It is based on the projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth that are in \nline  with,  but  slightly  lower  than,  Government\u2019s  medium-term  framework,  and  estimates  of \nexternal  assistance  that  reflect  natural  growth  while  pointing  to  diminishing  dependence  on \nexternal financing over the long term, in line with the trend observed in recent decades. Export \ngrowth is slightly higher in the medium term in line with recent export performance, but tapers \noff  to  more moderate  levels  in  the outer  years.  Both  the  GDP  and  export  growth  assumptions \nare  broadly  similar  to  the  assumptions  in  the  IMF\u2212World  Bank  DSA  prepared  in  2008.  Import \ngrowth  is  also  projected  to  be  significantly  higher  than  the  historical  average  throughout  the \nprojection  period  in  line  with  in  the  IMF\u2212World  Bank  DSA.  Finally,  due  to  strong  growth  in \nremittances from the oil exporting Gulf Cooperation Council states, United States, Europe, and \nMalaysia, private net current transfers are expected to remain buoyant.  \n\nBox A8: Bangladesh: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \n\nThe macroeconomic assumptions are as follows: \nReal  GDP  growth  in  the  medium  term  is  projected  to  be  between  6-6.5%,  slightly  above  the  recent  historical \naverage of 6%, and it picks up in the outer years to 7%. This is close to (but slightly lower than) the Government's \nown  medium-term  projection,  and  assumes  continued  progress  in  broad-based  structural  reforms  and  increased \nopenness  of  the  economy  that  should  allow  Bangladesh  to  benefit  from  dynamic  growth  elsewhere  in  the  Asian \nregion. \nInflation,  as  measured  by  the  GDP  deflator,  increased  in  2008  due  to  higher  food  and  energy  prices,  but  then \ndeclines and stabilizes at around 5.5% over the medium and long term. \nThe  growth  of  both  exports  and  imports  is  strong  in  the  medium  term,  in  the  12-15%  range.  As  the  economy \nopens,  both  will  increase  in  percent  of  GDP  with  imports  gaining  the  most  as  imports  of  investment  and \nintermediate goods increased. \nThe current account (including grants) moves from a small surplus to a deficit, which peaks in the outer years at \nabout  2%  of  GDP,  as  a  result  primarily  of  continued  strong  growth  of  capital  and  intermediate  goods  imports \nrelated to increasing investment projects. These effects are offset to some extent by strong growth of remittances, \nwhich  are  projected  to  grow  at  an  annual  average  of  about  12%  and  10%  over  the  medium  and  long  term, \nrespectively. \nThe current trend of declining reliance on external financing of the budget deficit will continue over the medium and \nlong term. The level of foreign grants is assumed to remain unchanged at the current level of $700 million per year \nthroughout the projection period. Gross external financing will increase slowly over the long term to about $4 billion \nper annum from the current level of $2.0 billion \u2212 $2.5 billion. The grant element of external loans will also decline \nover time. \nThe overall  fiscal  deficit (excluding grants) is assumed to remain close to the historical average (around 4% of \nGDP), while the primary deficit declines slightly over time. A modest rise is assumed in the revenue-to-GDP ratio \n(excluding grants) in the initial years (from 11.5% in FY2008 to 13% in FY2013), supported by efforts to mobilize \ndomestic revenues. Higher revenues will allow for correspondingly higher public sector spending in relation to GDP \nallowing for improved quality of public services. \nReal  interest  rate on domestic debt is assumed to stay more or less constant at about 5.5%. There is scope for \nreducing the real interest rate significantly, if the authorities initiate major financial sector reforms. If that happens, \nthe debt profile will improve in future, or will release more resources for higher government spending. \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nExternal Debt Sustainability Analysis \n\n \nB.  \n \n3. \nAll  external  debt  indicators  remain  well  below  the  policy-dependent  debt  burden \nthreshold under the baseline scenario.  Given the growing dependence on domestic debt over \ntime and the fiscal deficit at its historical level of about 4% of GDP (excluding grants), external \ndebt in relation to GDP would tend to fall very rapidly (Table A8.1 and Table A8.3). Total public \ndebt in relation to GDP will also fall, albeit at a much slower pace, by 8% points to 34% of GDP \nby FY2028.  \n \n\nTable A8.1: Total and External Debt in Relation to GDP and Total \nExternal Debt Service in % of Exports and Remittances \n\nFiscal \nYear \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n\nTotal Government \nDebt Outstanding \n(% of GDP) \n42.7 \n40.8 \n40.8 \n40.7 \n40.1 \n39.1 \n38.6 \n37.2 \n36.6 \n36.3 \n35.6 \n35.2 \n34.9 \n34.7 \n34.5 \n34.4 \n34.3 \n34.2 \n34.1 \n34.1 \n34.1 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n\nExternal Debt \n(% of GDP) \n25.4 \n23.2 \n22.1 \n20.6 \n19.2 \n17.9 \n16.7 \n15.6 \n14.5 \n13.6 \n12.7 \n11.9 \n11.2 \n10.5 \n9.9 \n9.3 \n8.7 \n8.2 \n7.7 \n7.2 \n6.7 \n\nTotal External Debt Service \n(% of exports and \nremittances) \n3.7 \n3.9 \n3.7 \n3.4 \n3.1 \n2.8 \n2.5 \n2.3 \n2.1 \n2.0 \n1.8 \n1.7 \n1.6 \n1.5 \n1.3 \n1.2 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n1.0 \n0.9 \n0.8 \n\n \n4. \nBangladesh\u2019s  external  debt  service  ratio  is  already  low  at  less  than  4%  of  export  and \nremittance  receipts.  Given  the  buoyant  trend  in  export  and  remittance  inflows  projected  in  the \nDSA  analysis,  external  debt  service  in  relation  to  exports  and  remittances  will  decline  to  less \nthan  1.0%  by  FY2028  (Table  A8.1).  This  scenario  also  assumes  a  reduction  in  the \nconcessionality  of  external  debt  as  the  average  interest  rate  on  foreign  debt  is  projected  to \nincrease slightly. \n \n5. \nAlthough no present value analysis has been prepared because of a lack of data on the \nconcessionality  of  individual  loans,  the  analysis  prepared  by  the  IMF  indicates  that  the  debt \nratios would tend to fall significantly if foreign debt is expressed in net present value terms.

Gross domestic debt has \nremained  at  about  17%  of  GDP  during  the  period  FY2002  through  FY2008.  The  majority  of \ndomestic debt is in the form of treasury bills and savings certificates held by nonbank financial \ninstitutions; and just a quarter is held by the central bank. \n \n7. \nThe  baseline  scenario  (Table  A8.3)  entails  a  steady  decline  in  the  public  debt-to-GDP \nratio,  with  external  debt  declining  but  domestic  debt  increasing  in  relation  to  GDP.  This  is  the \nnatural  outcome  of  the  trend  observed  in  the  last  two  decades,  with  a  growing  reliance  on \ndomestic  financing  of  the  budget  deficit.  External  aid,  which  was  in  the  range  of $2  billion  per \nyear  in  the  1980s,  has  remained  in  the  same  range  in  nominal  terms  in  recent  years.  The \noutlook for concessional external financing is also not so favorable. However, the scenario still \nallows for gross external financing of the budget to increase to more than $4 billion by FY2028, \ncompared with the $2.0 - $2.6 billion received in recent years. \n \nD.  \n \n8. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  requested  $500  million  under  the  ADB's \nCountercyclical  Support  Facility  Support  Program  to  help  cover  its  budget  financing  needs.  In \naddition, the Government has also requested for an additional $245 million (approximately) for \nbudget  support.  This  additional  borrowing  by  the  Government  would  increase  the  overall \nexternal debt service payments in the medium term, in particular to ADB. \n\nCapacity to Pay to ADB \n\n \n\n9. \nAnalysis presented below (Tables A8.4\u2212A8.6) indicates that while such additional external \nborrowing of $745 million (approximately) will increase interest and amortization payments to ADB \nin  the coming  years,  it will  not  have  any  significant  adverse  impact  on  Bangladesh\u2019s  capacity  to \nservice its obligations. In relation to receipts of exports and remittance inflows, total external debt \nservice to ADB (by FY2015) will still be about 1%. In relation to the level of reserves, debt service \npayments to ADB will be below 5% at their peak in FY2014, which would be quite manageable. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDebt Sustainability Indicators\nTotal

(PESF)  Program \n1. \nand the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) Support Program is structured around three main \nfeatures:  (i)  use  of  baseline  indicators  already  collated  during  the  processing  of  the  Program \n(the PESF and the CSF), (ii) leveraging existing systems and protocols at country level, and (iii) \ncoordination  across  development  partners.  Figure  A10  shows  the  overall  design  of  the \nmonitoring framework. \n \n2. \nUse of Baseline Indicators: The design and monitoring frameworks for both the PESF \nand CSF contain baseline indicators already collated. These indicators (listed in Appendix 1 and \nAppendix 2) are benchmarks against which progress will be monitored. \n \n3. \nExisting  Protocols  and  Systems  at  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB):  ADB  at \npresent  already  has  an  existing  set  of  activities  to  monitor  the  elements  of  the  Program.  This \nincludes  not  only  the  work  of  the  Bangladesh Resident  Mission  (BRM)  but  also  other  ongoing \nADB-funded interventions.  \n \n\nBRM. Over 70% of the portfolio has been delegated to BRM (the highest among \n(i) \nthe ADB Resident Missions), and there is considerable capacity to maintain a monitoring \nprotocol that will be used to conduct economic surveillance and assess, on a continuing \nbasis,  the  performance  and  direction  of  the  Program.  This  protocol  includes:  (i)  BRM's \nEconomics  Unit,  which  undertakes  regular  monitoring  of  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \ndevelopments  and  reform  progress  in  the  country,  and  publishes  the  results  in,  for \nexample, the Quarterly Economic Update and bimonthly Economic Indicators Update; (ii) \nefforts  of  the  Portfolio  Management  Unit  of  BRM  on  Annual  Development  Plan \nimplementation issues in the context of ongoing ADB projects and programs; and (iii) the \nannual Country Portfolio Review Mission which provide important monitoring milestones. \n \n(ii) \nExisting and proposed programs. These include, for example, (i) the proposed \nsmall-scale technical assistance on strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal monitoring \nat  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF);  (ii)  the  Good  Governance  Program, 1  which  has \nconducted a vulnerability to corruption assessment in several sectors, including health, \nrailways,  port  operations,  and  education;  and  (iii)  Regional  Technical  Assistance  6445: \nSupport  for  Implementation  of  the  Second  Governance  and Anticorruption  Action  Plan, \nunder which assistance is provided in the monitoring of governance indicators, including \non service delivery, as part of the work on the National Integrity Strategy. Results from \nthese  assessments  also  serve  as  benchmarks  against  which  the  progress  of  the \nProgram, as applied in these sectors, will be monitored. \n\n \n4. \nDonor  Coordination:  This  is  largely  done  through  the  local  consultative  group  (LCG), \nwhich  brings  together  development  partners  in  Bangladesh,  including  the  Joint  Strategy \nPartners  (World  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and  ADB).  A  separate  LCG  working  group  on  public \nfinancial  management  is  currently  being  formed  which,  along  with  the  existing  governance \nworking  group,  will  also  be  involved  in  helping  monitor  the  broader  context  of  the  CSF.  In \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Program  Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grants to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Good Governance Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nAppendix 10    Appendix 10        77 \n    77 \n\naddition,  there  are  numerous  sector-specific  LCG  working  groups  that  closely  monitor  public \nexpenditures in their respective areas of focus that can be drawn upon to assist in the broader \nmonitoring effort. \n \nB. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe proposed monitoring system consists of the following: \n\nProposed Measures  \n\nProgram steering committee (PSC). The PSC will meet regularly to review the \nprogress of the Program and report it to ADB. There will also be liaison with the \nprivate  sector  and  development  partners  to  solicit  their  feedback  on  emerging \npolicies  and \nthe \nmacroeconomic and fiscal conditions will also be carried out by the PSC.   \n\nthe  Program.  semi-annual  reviews  of \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe \n\nMonitoring  macroeconomic  performance.  ADB  will  review  and  assess \ndevelopments  in  the  key  macroeconomic  indicators  presented  and  described  in \nthe Access Criteria Matrix and the design and monitoring framework for the CSF, \nincluding  quarterly  fiscal  data  and  budget  outturns,  public  debt  ratios,  external \nbalance and monetary survey. In assessing the macroeconomic performance, it \nwill  draw  on  International  Monetary  Fund  reports  on  Bangladesh  including  the \nSelected Issues and its annual Article IV Consultations with the Government, and \nother relevant materials.  \n\nMonitoring  the  Government's  countercyclical  development  program.  ADB \nwill monitor and review aggregate budget outturns for the CSF and disbursement \nrates  of  the  key  line  ministries  implementing  the  social  safety  net  programs \n(SSNPs).  In  coordination  with  the  MOF,  ADB  will  also  monitor  progress  of \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical development program on the \nmajor  SSNPs,  especially  those  implemented  under  the  administrative  control  of \nthe  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management,  Ministry  of  Women  and \nChildren's  Affairs,  and  the  Local  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment, Rural Development, Cooperatives. The information will be available \nfrom  the  Government\u2019s  public  financial  management  systems,  including  reports \nfrom the office of the Controller General of Accounts, a department under on the \nMOF. \n\nImplementation Mechanisms for SSNPs \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nPolicy  directives  on  SSNPs  are  provided  in  the  budget  documents  and  the  directives \nissued  by  the  MOF,  while  implementation  is  the  responsibility  of  various  line  ministries.  The \nSSNPs  are  implemented  through  the  Government's  various  programs  or  projects,  such  as, \nallowances  for  the  destitute  women,  rehabilitation  of  physically  disabled,  'one  household,  one \nfarm',  employment  generation  for  the  hardcore  poor,  rural  roads  maintenance  program,  Test \nRelief,  Food  for  Works  Program,  vulnerable  group  development  for  ultra  poor  women,  micro \ncredit through nongovernment organizations, old age pension, vulnerable group feeding, school \nfeeding  program,  and  rural  road  maintenance  program.  Respective  line  ministries  prepare \nprogram or project documents, which need to be approved by the ministry in consultation with \nthe  MOF.  Each  SSNP  is  budgeted  and  its  annual  allocation  is  provided  in  the  Government's \nrecurrent  or  development  budget.  Line  ministry  formulates  guidelines  on  the  roles  of  each \nimplementing agency, departmental field offices, district administration and local governments; \nand  on  the  arrangements  for  implementation,  and  also  defines  entitlements  and  benefits. \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nModality for involving elected local officials, and setting up local level committees for oversight is \nalso determined by the line ministry.  \n \n7. \nFood related assistance schemes are implemented by the Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement  with  the  assistance  of  the  departments  under  it,  district  administration,  union \nparishads  (sub-districts)  and  departmental  field  offices.  The  Ministry  of  Food  has  a  well-\nfunctioning  and  reliable  monitoring  system  to  ensure  transparency  in  the  procurement  and \ndistribution of food grains. The food planning and monitoring unit under the Ministry provides a \ndaily  countrywide  report  on  the  Public  Food  Distribution  system  by  collecting  data  from  food \nsilos, ports, and other food warehouses located at the district and sub district level. The Ministry \nof  Food  also  submits  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  Finance  Division  of  MOF  covering \nprogress on food distribution through different SSNPs.  \n \n8. \nMinistry of Social Welfare is the line ministry, while the Directorate of Social Welfare is \nthe implementing agency for the old-age allowance program. Old-age allowances are delivered \nby  the  Ministry,  based  on  the  list  of  eligible  recipients  prepared  by  the  field  administration \nfollowing specified selection criteria. The fund is channeled through five state-owned banks. The \nDirectorate receives reports from the field offices on utilization of funds by the banks. In addition \nto the central monitoring done by the Directorate, arrangements exist for local monitoring by its \nfield offices.  \n \n9. \nEmployment generation for the hardcore poor is a new program, being implemented by \nthe Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. The field level project implementation units are \nresponsible for fund management, implementation and monitoring.  \n \n10. \nThe Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \nand Cooperatives and the Local Government Engineering Department under it, with support of \nthe union parishads, implement the rural roads maintenance program. Allocations are provided \nthrough the annual budget of the Government and there are guidelines on the implementation \nmodality  and  roles  of  different  agencies.  Destitute  women  are  organized  in  Labor  Contracting \nSocieties and provided the contract to maintain particular rural roads including tree plantation, \nand  they  receive  daily  wages  at  fixed  rates.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe proposed Program (PESF and CSF) is harmonized with the Government\u2019s National Strategy for \nAccelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II  (NSAPR  II)  and  the  Bangladesh  Country  Partnership  Strategy \n(CPS)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  NSAPR  II  reaffirms  that  reducing  poverty  and \naccelerating  the  pace  of  social  development  are  the  most  important  long-term  strategic  goals  for \nBangladesh.  The  NSAPR  II  aims  to  halve  the  number  of  poor  people  by  2015,  and  to  achieve \nsubstantial improvement in all aspects of human development. The Program will provide assistance \nto  the  Government  for  implementing  its  social  safety  net  programs  (SSNPs),  its  primary  tools  for \npoverty reduction. The improved investment climate would lead to higher investment on power and \nenergy,  transport,  and  urban  services.  ADB  support  will  also  foster  macroeconomic  stability  by \nreducing the need for inflationary domestic borrowing (which is also costlier) and preventing crowding \nout  of  private  investment.  By  improving  public  financial  management  (PFM),  the  Program  will \nincrease the efficiency of public spending and create more fiscal space for spending that benefit the \npoor.  Through  these  activities,  the  Program  will  help  maintain  satisfactory  economic  growth  and \naddress poverty concerns of the vulnerable segments of the population.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nBangladesh  has  made  mixed  progress  in  reducing  poverty.  From  2000  to  2005,  the  depth  and \nseverity  of  poverty  declined  simultaneously  both  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  However,  the  number  of \npeople living below the hardcore poor poverty line increased to 27 million in 2005 from 24.9 million in \n2000. The most severe poverty is located in urban slums and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Just less \nthan 20% of the population falls into the category of extreme poverty (lacking resources to acquire a \nminimum  dietary  intake). From  1991  to  2005,  the  poverty  reduction  rate  per  year  was  1.3%  points. \nHowever, from 2000 to 2005 income poverty declined from 48.9% to 40% (or 1.8% points annually, \non average). \n\nAdverse  impacts  in  the  export  sector  stemming  from  the  global  economic  crisis  will  directly  affect \npoverty via employment losses and wage cuts. With more than 2.2 million workers and equal number \nof workers employed in ancillary activities, a slowdown of ready-made-garment exports will translate \ninto  widespread  poverty  both  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  As  the  majority  of  ready-made-garment \nworkers are female, a crisis in the ready-made-garment sector will have substantial poverty impacts. \nFurthermore,  a  deceleration  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  and contagion  of  the  crisis  to \nother sectors will push a vast pool of the laborers and their families below the poverty line. Small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  disproportionately  vulnerable  to  global  economic  crises;  this \npotentially has huge poverty implications. A slowdown in income growth will hit existing poor people\u2014\nconsisting of a variety of vulnerable groups, mostly the elderly, children, and women\u2014hardest. \n \nLikewise, a fall in remittance inflows will result in direct income loss to recipient households. For many \nhouseholds in rural areas, remittance earnings are the main source of income and livelihood. A fall in \nremittance  income  will  directly  affect  consumption  and  the  nutritional  status  of  many  rural  families. \nBecause  of  higher  linkage  effects,  the  poverty  impacts  of  a  fall  in  remittance  income  will  have  an \namplified effect on overall poverty incidence.    \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\nA  slowdown  of  economic  activities  will  severely  squeeze  the  Government's  fiscal  space.  Given  the \nuncertain  aid  inflow,  fiscal  revenue  will  be  insufficient  to  finance  poverty-related  expenditures\u2014\nparticularly targeted social safety net programs (SSNPs).  \n\n2.  Design Features \n \nDesign features of the  Program that will help reduce poverty directly or indirectly include: \n \n(i)  Financial  support  to  the  Government  to  reduce  the  fiscal  pressure  on  the  budget  arising  from \nexpanded SSNPs. By reducing the financing gap, the Program will directly contribute to mitigating the \npotential adverse impacts of the global economic crisis on poverty by enhancing access to food and \nemployment opportunities, as envisioned in the SSNPs.  \n\n(ii)  The  Program  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  encourage  greater  private  investment  in \ninfrastructure,  accelerate  public  infrastructure  project  implementation,  and  improve  social  service \ndelivery to maximize pro-poor growth. By mitigating the adverse impacts of the global crisis on fiscal \nspace  to  finance  pro-poor  development  activities  and  promoting  basic  social  service  delivery  and \ninfrastructure  spending,  the  Program  will  also  positively  contribute  to  income  acceleration  and \nemployment. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to \n\nthe country and major groups affected. \n\n \nThe  Program  will  support  the  Government's  immediate  actions  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  the  global \ncrisis  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  They  will  also  support  reforms  for  enhancing  pro-poor \ngrowth and improve living standards in the medium term. The poverty impact will be reflected in two \nparticular  streams:  (i)  in  the  short  term,  budgetary  support  will  help  fill  the  financing  gap  stemming \nfrom  global-crisis-related  revenue  shocks,  which  will  allow  critical  public  expenditure  programs  to \nremain  in  place  or  be  strengthened\u2014in  particular,  SSNPs;  and  (ii)  maintaining  macroeconomic \nstability will stimulate private investment and promote faster economic growth in the medium term\u2014\nthereby enabling the creation of an effective social safety net system that benefits poor and vulnerable \ngroups, and ultimately helps the country attain its poverty reduction goals. \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer \n\nto social analysis). \n\n \nImproving  and  scaling  up  safety  net  operations  will  ensure  increased  access  to  food  and  social \nservices  for  the  poor  and  help  to  also  cover  people  previously  non  poor  who  are  hurt  by  the  crisis. \nMechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  that  creates  opportunities  for  poor  and  vulnerable  people  to  be \ninformed about the benefits they are entitled to, and to claim their rights. Preparing a comprehensive \nlist of hardcore poor and vulnerable populations will also lead to improved targeting and effectiveness \nof  SSNPs.  The  establishment  of  a  reliable  food  security  system  will  help  to  protect  against  food \ninflation and improve access for the poor.  \n \nIn addition, scaled-up infrastructure investment and a fiscal stimulus package will help reduce the risk \nof  unemployment  and  income  loss  in  the  immediate  term,  and  also  enhance  longer-term  growth. \nCloser  performance  monitoring  will  strengthen  accountability  on  the  use  of  public  resources  and. \nreduce the scope for irregularities or corruption. Microcredit programs for women entrepreneurs and \nsupport for SMEs will contribute to make growth more inclusive.  \n \n3.  Discuss  how  the  policy  reform(s)  contribute(s)  to  poverty  reduction,  pro-poor  growth,  and  the \n\nMillennium Development Goals. \n\nThe Program\u2019s support of SSNPs will create fiscal space which will enable the Government to scale \nup  infrastructure  investment  and  implement  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  while  ensuring  the  continued \nflow  of  credit  to  the  private  sector.  These  actions  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of  unemployment  and \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n\nincome  loss  in  the  immediate  term,  and  also  enhance  longer-term  growth.  Closer  performance \nmonitoring  will  strengthen  accountability  on  the  use  of  public  resources  and.  reduce  the  scope  for \nirregularities  or  corruption.  Providing  support  to  improve  the  business  environment  is  part  of  the \nGovernment's holistic approach to promoting private sector development and pro-poor growth. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Bangladesh economy has been severely impacted by the global crisis. The coming months will \nsee the effects of the crisis compounded. Already overseas workers are returning home and export \norders  are  slowing.  The  resultant  drop  in  remittances,  migration,  and  exports  of  ready-made \ngarments  will  slow  economic  growth,  drive  down  household  incomes,  and  lead  to  rising \nunemployment in the formal and informal sectors. \n \nAt  the  household  level,  the  economic  downturn  is  reducing  job  opportunities,  incomes,  and \npurchasing power. This is forcing households to seek alternative work, mainly as casual laborers at \nreduced real wages. Opportunities for wage employment\u2014the top priority for the poor\u2014are already \ndecreasing. If the poor are earning less, the risk increases that they will fall into debt and/or be unable \nto afford proper healthcare, education, food intake, nutrition, or other vital services. Even though food \nprices have declined, the largest share of the average household budget is still spent on food (52%). \nLower income could force poor households to cut food spending, which could affect nutrition status \nand have long term adverse effects on health.  \n \nMicrofinance institutions that rely on commercial funding may face refinancing threats; this risk could \nbe  magnified  if  donors  reduce  their  support.  Other  potential  social  consequences  are  malnutrition, \nmorbidity,  frustration,  social  tension,  and  deterioration  of  law  and  order\u2014all  of  which  carry \nunquantifiable  costs.  Employment,  income,  availability  of  food  in  markets,  efficient  delivery  of \nservices, affordability of goods and services are all important issues. \n   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Program, processed in response to the economic crisis, was conceived by ADB jointly with the \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  (the  Government).  The  needs  assessment  and  consultation  schedule \nwere drawn up jointly with the Government, with inputs from other development partners and relevant \nstakeholders.  Components  of  the  Program  were  designed  after  extensive  consultation  with  the \nMinistry of Finance and the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. As part of its CPS midterm \nreview,  ADB  discussed  the  idea  of  the  Program  (especially  the  PESF)  with  civil  society,  academic, \nand  private  sector  representatives.  Regular  interaction  with  various  agencies  continued  during  the \npreparation phase. ADB's proposed support for strengthening safety nets for the poor and vulnerable \nwas  supported  by  stakeholders.  In  addition,  mechanisms  to  ensure  benefits  for  the  poor  and  for \nwomen  through  improved  delivery  of  SSNPs,  including  through  employment  guarantee  and  food \nsecurity  schemes,  as  well  as  support  for  SMEs  and  women  entrepreneurs,  were  also  discussed. \nDonors  thought  that  ADB's  support  was  useful  to  create  greater  fiscal  space  for  additional \ncountercyclical expenditures that could avert a sharper reduction in growth and employment. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation \nand monitoring?  \n\n   Information sharing     \n\n Consultation    \n\n  Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n83 \n\n No  \n\n  Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan \n(including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Program  was  processed  quickly  to  provide  budgetary  support  to  the  Government,  thus  a  full-\nfledged C&P plan was not prepared. However, a short C&P Plan has been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix J) The plan includes the objectives and methods of involvement of various stakeholders in \nstrengthening  and  scaling  up  existing  SSNPs  to  benefit  the  poor,  women,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups.  Local  government  institutions  will  be  involved  in  implementing  the  SSNPs.  Nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  involved  in  identifying  beneficiaries  and  in  delivering  and  monitoring  some  old \nand new SSNPs.   \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues \n \nWomen generally face the challenges of managing households' food security and nutritional needs. \nDuring economic crises, they face an enormous challenge in managing their households' food supply. \nAccording  to  the  International  Labour  Organization,  the  global  crisis  will  plunge  a  huge  number  of \nwomen  into  unemployment  and  push  them  into  insecure  jobs.  Women  make  up  a  majority  of  the \nexport manufacturing workforce, but concentrate mostly in insecure, low-wage, low-skill jobs. Women \nwho have migrated to urban areas and abroad are also being hard hit by the crisis. Their wages and \nremittances  are  important  sources  of  family  income.  Overseas  workers  are  returning  home  in \nincreasing  numbers,  affecting  the  family  food  security  situation.  Female  garment  workers  are  still \nreeling from last years' food crisis, and their situation is worsening. Though experts predict that the \nBangladesh economy will see few factory closures or job cuts, the pricing advantage in the garment \nsector over competitors will count little as demand for Bangladesh's exports in the West is shrinking. \nA  drop  in  export  prices  would  put  pressure  on  workers'  wages,  the  majority  of  whom  are  women. \nEmployers  often  exploit  the  low  bargaining  power  of  women  to  evade  statutory  labor  rights,  like \nsigning  redundancy  letters  to  avoid  payment  of  severance  benefits  and  replacement  of  regular \nemployees  by  casual  workers.  Enterprises  not  cutting  jobs  are  trying  to  cut  wages,  overtime \npayments,  subsidized  meals,  transport,  and  other  such  benefits.  The  potential  refinancing  threat  to \nmicrofinance  institutions  that  rely  on  commercial  funding  may  cause  problems  in  microfinance \noperations, affecting household food security and livelihoods where the majority of beneficiaries are \nwomen.   \n \nLacking  unemployment  insurance  and  cash  benefits,  unemployed  women  will  quickly  become \ndestitute.  Often  women  sell  their  assets  and  resort  to  money  lenders  for  survival.  Female-headed \nhouseholds suffer the most from loss of income and employment. Family health and nutritional needs \nare  often  sacrificed,  resulting  in  long-lasting  negative  effects  on  their  children's  lives.  Often \nhouseholds  cope  by  reducing  the  number  of  meals  per  day  they  feed  their  family,  or  reducing  the \nquality of their diet. Women often forgo their own nutrition to ensure that other family members get \nenough to eat. This practice ends up severely affecting their own health. As Government revenues \nshrink  and  deficits  rise,  expenditures  on  SSNPs  to  protect  households  living  in  poverty  will  decline \nunless external aid is increased. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The proposed loans will allow the Government to maintain \nSSNPs focusing on poor households (especially households headed by women, who constitute the \nmajority of the poor population). The Government's annual budget for FY2010 allocates $2.5 billion \nfor SSNPs; about 83% of this will go toward social protection programs targeting mainly poor women. \nThe Program will allow the Government to generate 5 million person-months of work in rural areas; \nagain women will be the main beneficiaries. Budget support to preserve macroeconomic stability and \nstimulate private investment will also benefit poor and vulnerable groups by creating an environment \nfor additional employment in the private sector and infrastructure. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n\n84 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n2.  Key Actions \n \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n   No action/measure \n\n \nThe Program will contribute to the Government's plan to scale up SSNPs to cover 96 million beneficiaries \nwith livelihood support. The key indicators will be the number of women covered under social SSNPs, the \nnumber  of women  trained  under  various  schemes,  and  access  to  work  opportunities.  The Program will \nmonitor the increase in coverage of vulnerable people by SSNPs (FY2009 estimated baseline: 72 million \npeople).  The  Government,  assisted  by  development  partners,  has  developed  a  strategy  to  monitor  the \neffectiveness and reach of most ongoing SSNPs. The Government will soon finalize a plan to prepare a \nlist of hardcore poor that will serve as the basis for better targeting and monitoring. \n \nThe Government's initiatives to improve public financial management and the investment climate, and \nto create better mechanisms for SSNPs, will also benefit women. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included \nin Design \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nNo Impact \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Program does not \ninvolve any construction, \nland acquisition, and \nresettlement; therefore, they \ndo not trigger resettlement or \ncompensation requirements.  \n \nIndigenous people will \npotentially benefit from the \nsafety net programs.

term, the Program will support the Government to provide immediate relief \nfor the poor through scaled up SSNPs benefiting the hardcore poor and women, as well as workers retrenched from sectors affected by the global crisis; (ii) \nat the same time, financial support for SSNPs will free public resources and enable higher investment in infrastructure, thus protecting jobs; (iii) in the \nmedium term, the Program will help the country to attain its poverty reduction goals by raising the country's growth potential through reducing recourse to \ndomestic financing for investment so as to preserve macroeconomic stability, stimulating private investment, and improving transparency and efficiency in \npublic resource management. \nNSAPR II = National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise, SSNP = social safety net program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n7\n\n
