Local community facilitation \ncenters  will  also  be  developed  along  the  project  roads  to  enable  local  communities  to  take \nadvantage of the improved mobility through rehabilitated project roads. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nPakistan\u2019s  transport  sector  contributes  10%  to  its  gross  domestic  product,  consumes \n3. \n35% of the total energy annually, and is the recipient of 20%\u201325% of the annual federal public \nsector  development  program.  It  generates  a  large  number  of  employment  opportunities, \nestimated at 2.3 million jobs (5.9% of the employed labor force). The total road network is about \n260,000  km  and  consists  of  national  highways  (about  11,400  km),  provincial  highways \n(92,500 km), and district and urban roads (156,100 km). The national highway network, which is \n4%  of  the  total  road  network,  caters  to  80%  of  the  commercial  traffic.  Road  transport  is  a \ndominant  transport  mode  in  Pakistan\u2014accounting  for  91%  of  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of \nfreight traffic.  Despite  the high  reliance  on  road transport,  the quality  of the road  infrastructure \ncauses severe capacity constraints. Although the quality of the national highways has improved \nconsiderably  over  the  past  decades  through  continuous  investments  and  better  road  asset \nmanagement, the overall road condition needs further improvement. \n\n4. \nPakistan  is  strategically  located  to  act  as  a  hub  for  subregional  transport  and  to  take \nadvantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving environment for the development of transit and \ncross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route to the sea \nfor  landlocked  Afghanistan,  Central  Asia,  and  Xinjiang  province  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina.  However,  physical,  institutional,  and  other  constraints  prevent  Pakistan  from  taking  full \nadvantage of  its  location. The  potential for  increased trade through  improved  trade facilitation, \nrehabilitated transport links, efficient cross-border movements, and increased efficiency at ports \nhas not fully materialized. \n\n5. \nBefore  1995,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  Pakistan  had  focused  on \nimprovement  of  rural  access  roads  to  ensure  all-weather  access  to  villages\u2014to  complement \nADB\u2019s then focus on agriculture sector development. From 1995, the perspective was expanded \nto  national  connectivity  for  economic  growth  in  general,  and  the  assistance  started  to  cover \nprovincial and national highways. Since 2005, ADB assistance has focused on the trade corridor \nand regional connectivity to help government take advantage of its strategic location and act as \na hub for subregional transport. Two multitranche financing facilities provided in 2005 and 2007 \nwere designed to construct and/or improve key trade corridors connecting sea ports, industrial \ncenters, and border crossing points.2 \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Trade Corridor Highway Investment Program. Manila; and ADB. 2005. \n\n \n\n\fIn parallel  with assistance for  road  infrastructure improvement,  ADB  has supported  the \n6. \ngovernment  to  address  institutional  constraints.  ADB\u2019s  program  loan  provided  in  2001  for  the \nnational  sector  policy  reform  program  assisted  the  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  in \nimplementing  comprehensive  reform  programs  covering  (i)  transport  policy,  (ii)  road  sector \nresource  management,  (iii)  road  sector  preservation,  (iv)  institutional  efficiency  improvement, \nand  (v)  road  safety.3 Through  institutional  capacity  development  and  institutional  reforms,  the \nNHA  has  become  a  capable  road  agency  despite  structural  constraints.  It  managed  to \n(i) establish  the  road  maintenance  fund  and  secure  a  stable  source  of  road  maintenance \nexpenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, which allows more efficient use \nof scarce resources; (iii) establish the National Highway and Motorway Police, which contributes \nto  controlling  overloading  and  reducing  traffic  violations  and  accidents  on  motorways  and \nnational highways; (iv) promote awareness of policy makers and regulators on road safety; and \n(v) change the mindset of policy makers and NHA officials toward public\u2013private partnerships. \n\n7. \nDespite  these  achievements,  sector  reforms  should  continue,  particularly  for  (i)  the \nchronic shortfall of road maintenance resources generated through the road maintenance fund \n(the toll base should be expanded and the toll rate should be rationalized); (ii) overloading (the \ntrucking  industry  should  be  restructured\u2014this  is  dominated  by  a  small  fleet  of  owners  and  by \nlocal manufacturers producing low-capacity, low-powered trucks protected by high import tariffs \non  high-capacity,  multi-axle  trucks);  (iii)  road  safety  (national  and  provincial  efforts  should  be \nconcerted, with responsibilities and accountability clearly demarcated among the institutions and \nprovincial departments); and (iv) public\u2013private partnership (the country risk should be reduced \nto a tolerable level for private investors to price it properly). \n\nBalochistan  is  situated  in  southwest  Pakistan  and  is  the  largest  province  by  area, \n8. \nconstituting  44%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  total  land  mass.  It  is  bordered  by  Afghanistan  north  and \nnorthwest,  by  Iran  southwest,  and  by  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  the  Federally  Administered \nTribal  Areas  northeast.  To  the  south  lies  the  Arabian  Sea.  Balochistan  links  the  geopolitical \nregions  of  the  Middle  East,  Central  Asia,  and  South  Asia;  and  provides  the  shortest  route  to \nseaports from Central Asia and Xinjiang province, the People\u2019s Republic of China. Despite this \nlarge  potential  as  a  transport  hub,  its  economic  development  has  been  stagnant  because  of \npoor security  and  political  instability,  and  its transport  infrastructure  is  dire\u2014hardly  serviceable \nfor  regional  transit  traffic.  The  road  network  and  connectivity  is  the  poorest  in  the  country. \nBalochistan has the lowest density of roads among the four provinces. \n\n9. \nBalochistan  is  connected  to  the  country\u2019s  political  and  industrial  centers  by  the  N-50 \n(from Quetta  to Qila Saifullah,  Zhob,  Mughal  Kot,  DI  Khan,  Kohat,  and  ultimately  to  Peshawar \nand Islamabad) and the N-70 (from Quetta to Qila Saifullah, Loralai, Waghum Rud, DG Khan, \nand  ultimately  to  Multan).  Despite  the  government\u2019s  effort  to  improve  mobility  along  these \ncorridors,  the  Zhob\u2013Mughal  Kot  section  of  the  N-50  and  the  Qila  Saifullah\u2013Waghum  Rud \nsection  of  the  N-70  remain  missing  links  and  seriously  hamper  the  seamless  flow  of  traffic. \nConsequently, traffic originating  in Quetta bound for northern and western Punjab, the political \nand  industrial  centers  in  the  country,  takes  a  longer  route  through  the  N-65  (from  Quetta  to \nJacobabad and Sukkur in Sindh province) and then the N-5 (northward to Multan and farther to \nLahore and Islamabad). Rehabilitating the two missing links and completing the network of the \nN-50 and the N-70 will redirect traffic to a shorter and less costly route, and help integrate cities \nand towns along the N-50 and the N-70 into Balochistan\u2019s development initiative. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the National Highway Development Sector Investment Program. Manila. \n\n3  ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImprovement  of  the  national  highway  network  in  Balochistan  is  expected  to  enable \n10. \nsocioeconomic  development  of  the  province  by  shortening  distances  across  the  province  with \nimproved  interprovincial  links.  However,  trickling  down  of  these  benefits  to  local  rural \ncommunities in extreme impoverishment requires a transport link to enable local communities to \naccess  consumers.  Such  a  link  is  hampered  by  (i)  unavailable  or  limited  access  to  transport \n(goods  and  freight  transport)  to  carry  the  harvest  of  small  farmers  to  nearby  urban  centers, \n(ii)  nonexistent  local  markets  or  thin  markets  in  nearby  rural  centers  for  agricultural  products, \n(iii)  limited  information  and  resources  to  access  competitive  markets  in  faraway  areas,  and \n(iv) limited resources and opportunities for engaging in alternate livelihoods such as small-scale \nbusiness  or  trade  at  the  roadside.  As  a  link  between  project  roads  and  the  local  population, \ncommunity  facilitation  centers  in  nearby  rural  settlements  along  the  project  roads  will  be \ninstrumental  in  distributing  the  benefits  of  the  improved  highway  network  to rural  communities \n(see para. 15). \n\nSince  early  2000s,  Balochistan  has  been  neglected from  Pakistan\u2019s  main  development \n11. \nthrust,  mainly  because  of  poor  security  and  political  instability.  Balochistan\u2019s \nlack  of \ndevelopment  allows  insurgents  to  gain  ground  and  a  vicious  circle  follows.  The  government \ndefines  its  top  development  agenda  as  equitable  provincial  development,  and  tries  to  help \nlagging  provinces  like  Balochistan  to  catch  up  and  integrate  with  the  rest  of  the  country. \nADB  support  for  Balochistan\u2019s  road  network  improvement  will  encourage  the  government  to \npursue its priority agenda and be prepared for the future when Balochistan will play a key role in \neconomic growth and regional cooperation and integration. \n\n12. \nADB has coordinated closely with other development partners, including the World Bank \nand Japan International Cooperation Agency, for road sector development in Pakistan; and has \nplayed  a  lead  role  in  upgrading  road  infrastructure  and  sector  management.  Collaboration \nbetween development partners for sector reforms was instrumental to transforming the NHA into \na  service-oriented  road  asset  manager  with  a  sophisticated  road  asset  management  system. \nThrough  involvement  in  road  sector  development,  ADB  has  gained  valuable  lessons  such  as \ndesigning  projects  with  a  manageable  number  of  components  and  implementing  agencies, \ncarefully assessing the capacity of counterpart funding, estimating project costs conservatively \nand  avoiding  cost  overrun,  and  properly  assessing  the  time  frame  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement of affected people. These lessons are adequately incorporated in the design of the \nproject. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  project  will  be  an  accessible,  affordable,  and  safe  national \nhighway  network  in  Balochistan.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  reduced  transport  cost  from \nBalochistan to the political and industrial centers of the country. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe first  output  will  be  the  rehabilitated two-lane  Zhob\u2013Mughal  Kot  section  of the  N-50 \n\n14. \n(81 km) and the Qila Saifullah\u2013Waghum Rud section of the N-70 (120 km). \n\n15. \nThe project will develop community facilitation centers along the project roads, focusing \non (i) creating opportunities for the local population to exploit the benefits offered by  improved \nmobility; (ii) improving local market hubs in rural centers along the project road, with community \ninvolvement;  (iii)  improving  rural  market  hubs\u2019  access  to,  and  linkage  with,  national  markets \nthrough project roads; and (iv) helping socioeconomic uplift of local communities by organizing \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nand promoting local products and alternate means of livelihood. The second output will be five \nlocal community facilitation centers along the project roads, better integrated into the improved \nmobility through rehabilitated project roads. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n16. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $235 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,4 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

This  is  based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  the \n\ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n\n5  The Department for International Development of the United Kingdom has indicated its interest to contribute about \n$65 million equivalent of grant cofinancing to the project. If such cofinancing becomes available, it will be on a joint \nbasis with full administration by ADB. \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n19. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  the  NHA.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be \nestablished under  the  NHA  for  overall  implementation  of construction,  including  supervision of \ncontractors and supervision consultants. A general manager will head the PIU, which will have \nsuitably qualified staff including project directors and safeguard specialists. \n\n20. \nProcurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  To  ensure  competition,  international  competitive  bidding  contracts  will  be  adopted. \nThe  project  will  require  consulting  services  for  design  review  and  construction  supervision. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be \nsought  to  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  project  (Table  3).  Retroactive  financing  for \nresettlement  cost  will  be  executed  through  reimbursement  arrangements  under  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  has  been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the project. \n\n21. \nFor  the  development  of  community  facilitation  centers,  a  social  development  specialist \nwith adequate knowledge of the socioeconomic fabric of the area and local needs will be hired \nas  part  of  supervision  consultants.  The  social  community  development  specialist  will  carry  out \npublic  consultations  with  all  stakeholders  (including  the  local  administration,  civil  society \norganizations working in the field, and the local community) to assess their needs; and engage \nwith  relevant  local  government  departments  and  community  support  organizations  to  provide \nand  manage  the  required  facilities.  Based  on  consultation,  the  PIU  will  design  and  implement \nthe  facilitation  centers  under  the  supervision  of  the  construction  supervision  consultants. \nThe civil works contractor will carry out any construction work. \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n22. \nthe project administration manual.6 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2018 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2015\u2013June 2018 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance contracting \n\nSteering committee, NHA \nChairman, NHA (chair) \nSenior members, NHA (members) \nNHA \nPIU in Qila Saifullah, headed by general manager with 2 project directors and 7 staff \nmembers assigned \nInternational competitive \nbidding \nQCBS \n\n$188.2 million \n\n$9.0 million \n\n4 contracts \n\nInternational: 78 person-months \nNational: 2,309 person-months \n\nAdvance contracting for civil works and supervision consultant. \nRetroactive  financing  for  resettlement  cost  for  up  to  $1.0  million  of  the  loan  amount, \nprovided that expenditures are incurred during the 12 months before the signing of the \nloan agreement. \n\n                                                \n6  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NHA  =  National  Highway  Authority,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n23. \nThe  existing  project  roads  will  be  rehabilitated  to  NHA  specifications  for  national \nhighways\u2014carriageway  width  of  7.3  meters,  with  two  lanes  constructed  of  aggregate  base \ncourses  and  asphaltic  layers  and  2.5  meter-wide  surface  treated  shoulders.  Drainage  will  be \nimproved  through  the  construction  of  reinforced  cement  concrete  box  culverts  as  well  as  the \nconstruction of new bridge structures as required.7 Road safety works (including signage, lane \nmarking,  and  road furniture)  will  be  carried  out  in accordance  with  NHA standards for  national \nhighways. The proposed rehabilitation work is technically feasible, with manageable social and \nenvironmental impacts. \n\nFor both road sections, the detailed design of the road pavement, road geometrics, and \n24. \nbridge  structures  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  acceptable  international  practices. \nThe  pavement  design  of  both  roads  sections  is  based  on  Road  Note  31  (Transport  Research \nLaboratory, United Kingdom).8 Geometric design is based on the American Association of State \nHighway  and  Transportation  Officials  policy  on  geometric  design  of  highways  and  streets. 9 \nBridges  are  designed  in  accordance  with  the  West  Pakistan  Code  of  Practice  for  highway \nbridges  1967, 10  and  conform  to  the  American  Concrete  Institute  Code  of  Practice 11  and \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Bridge Design Codes.12 \n\n25. \nThe  bid  documents  for  procurement  of  civil  works  packages  contain  these  detailed \ndesign  drawings.  Under  the  loan,  the  consultant  firms  recruited  for  design  review  and \nconstruction  supervision  will  carry  out  a  review  of  the  detailed  design,  and  incorporate  any \nchanges needed during implementation. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  analysis  evaluates  the  economic  viability  of  the  N-50  Zhob\u2013Mughal  Kot \n26. \nand  the  N-70  Qila  Saifullah  to  Waghum  Rud  sections.  The  analyses  compare  the  benefits \narising  from  the  project\u2014time  savings  and  a  reduction  in  vehicle  operating  costs\u2014against  the \nup-front investment cost and incremental changes to operation and maintenance costs over the \n20-year appraisal period. \n\n                                                \n7  As the country experienced heavy floods in 2009\u20132011, the NHA strengthened its design standards by raising the \n\nroad profile in the project area to make its road assets more resilient to climate change. \n\n8  Transport  Research  Laboratory.  1993.

The  N-50  Zhob\u2013Mughal  Kot  section  has  an  EIRR  of \n23.8%,  while  the  N-70  Qila  Saifullah\u2013Waghum  Rud  section  has  an  EIRR  of  15.1%.  As  both \nsections  have  EIRRs  in  excess  of  the  ADB  threshold,  the  project  is  considered  economically \nviable. \n\n28. \nThere are no plans to toll either the N-50 Zhob\u2013Mughal Kot or the N-70 Qila Saifullah\u2013\nWaghum  Rud  sections,  so  the  project  will  not  be  revenue-generating.  The  government \nestablished a road  maintenance fund in 2003 that  is financed  by  toll  revenue from motorways \nand  national  highways,  federal  grants,  and  other  road  revenues.  The  fund  provides  a  stable \nsource  for  road  maintenance  expenditure\u2014free  from  federal  fiscal  budget  allocation,  which  is \nopen  to  political  influence.  The  fund  has  enabled  the  NHA  to  plan  and  use  scarce  resources \neffectively,  setting  priorities  according  to  the  economic  rate  of  return  calculated  by  the  road \nasset management system. Resources generated by the road maintenance fund are 30%\u201340% \nshort  of  the  unconstrained  requirement  to  maintain  roads  at  the  level  of  new  pavement. \nConstrained by  scarce resources,  the  NHA  aims  to maintain the roads in such  a way  that  the \nvehicle  operating  cost  is  kept  30%\u201340%  higher  than  that  of  newly  paved  roads.  The  project \nroads  will  be  maintained  in  line  with  this  strategy.  However,  in  the  long  term,  the  standard  of \nroad  maintenance  will  be  raised  to  the  level  of  new  pavement.  To  overcome  this  shortage  of \nfunds, the NHA is trying to rationalize the toll level, one of the lowest in the world, and expand \nthe  base  of  toll  collection  by  building  more  toll-based  motorways  and  transforming  existing \nnational highways into toll-based. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n30. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  NHA  or  the  implementation  of  the  project  was \ncarried  out.  The  purpose  of  the  assessment  was  to  determine  the  financial  management \ncapacity  of  the  NHA  in  maintaining  the  accounting  systems,  financial  controls,  and  audit \narrangements.  NHA  financial  accounting,  internal  and  external  auditing  rules,  and  internal \ncontrol  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  accounting  and  auditing  practices. \nThe NHA maintains separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor  the  project,  and  use  of  local  funds,  including  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial \nreporting  arrangements.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited \nannually in accordance with national and international auditing standards by the Auditor General \nof Pakistan and by a chartered accountant. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe  country\u2019s  national  poverty  rate  is  33%,  while  the  population  below  the  extreme \npoverty line is 21% (2012).13 Balochistan is one of the poorest provinces in Pakistan. In addition \nto long-standing political instability, the poor condition of infrastructure inhibits economic activity \nof  people  both  within  and  outside  the  province.  In  Balochistan,  the  poverty  rate  in  2012  was \nestimated  at  52%,  and  poverty  incidence  is  higher  in  rural  areas  (72%)  than  in  urban  areas \n\n                                                \n13 Sustainable  Policy  Development  Institute.  2012.  Clustered  Deprivation:  District  Profile  of  Poverty  in  Pakistan. \n\nIslamabad. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f(29%).  The  project  aims  to  increase  economic  growth  through  the  enhancement  of  trade  and \ntraffic along the project roads. The project will benefit both local communities (through improved \naccess  to  markets  and  social  service  facilities,  and  enhanced  opportunities  for  community \nnetworking) and the population of the wider region through transportation of goods. During  the \nsocioeconomic survey, about 200 households and men and women from settlements along the \nproject road participated in consultations and focus group discussions. The majority stated that \nthe  project  would  increase  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by  improving  linkages  to \nmarkets, production centers, and public and social service facilities. \n\n32. \nGender.  Established  sociocultural  practices  in  the  project  area  mean  that  women \nresiding  along  the  project  roads  are  unlikely  to  participate  in  civil  works  or  roadside  business \nwith construction workers or drivers.  Focus group discussions were undertaken with women in \nthe  project  influence  area,  and  detailed  gender  analysis  will  be  conducted  by  a  national \nspecialist early during implementation to identify priority concerns of local women. These will be \ntaken into account in designing the function and activities of the proposed community facilitation \ncenters.  In  preliminary  consultations,  women  identified  project  benefits  for  them  as  better \ntransport  services  and  improved  access  to  social  services,  markets,  education  and  health \nfacilities,  and  employment  opportunities.  The  bidding  documents  provide  clauses  designed  to \nensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child \nlabor  or  forced  labor;  encourage  the  employment  of  the  poor,  particularly  women;  and  do  not \noffer different wages to men and women for work of equal value. \n\n33. \nHIV/AIDS,  other  communicable  diseases,  and  human  trafficking.  The  prevalence \nrate of HIV/AIDS in the country is 0.10% (2011). Surveillance data for Balochistan in 2011 found \nHIV  infection  among  7%  of  injecting  drug  users  in  Quetta. 14 However,  the  potential  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and/or communicable diseases are always a \nconcern  because  the  main  reasons  for  prevalence  are  sexual  transmissions  and  abuse  of \ninjections,  which  are  not  publicly  well  campaigned  and  not  well  regulated,  particularly  in  rural \nareas.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  project  will  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence,  during  or  after \nimplementation.  However,  any  associated  risks  will  be  minimized  by  conducting  awareness \ncampaigns  targeting  construction  workers  and  local  populations  during  implementation. \nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  conduct  these  campaigns,  under  the  oversight  of  the \nconstruction supervision consultant and the NHA, and such requirement will be included in the \ncivil works bid documents and contract. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  categorized  environment  category  B.  The  civil \nworks  associated  with  the  two  road  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  limited  to  resurfacing  and \nsome widening. This will involve minimum civil works, and the entire operation will remain within \nthe  existing  right-of-way  (ROW)  of  both  highways.  The  environmental  impacts  that  will  result \nfrom  this  are  limited  to  the  construction  phase  of  the  two  subprojects;  all  impacts  will  be \ntemporary  in  nature,  with  no  residual  long-term  impacts.  Initial  environmental  examination \nreports  for  the  two  project  roads  were  prepared  and  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  on  8  and \n9 January  2014.  The  environment,  afforestation,  land,  and  social  wing  of  the  NHA  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  This  NHA  unit  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports,  which  will  be  disclosed  on  the \nADB website. \n\n                                                \n14 National  AIDS  Control  Program  Pakistan.  2011.

The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \n35. \nresettlement  impacts.  The  project  was  designed  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and  minimize  the \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts by adopting existing alignment of the project roads and  using \nthe most feasible technical design. According to the detailed design, the proposed rehabilitation \nand  improvement  works  will  be  confined  to  15\u201321  meter  width  while  the  ROW  of  33  meter  in \nurban  areas  and  66  meter  in  rural  areas  is  secured.  However,  in  some  sections  near \nsettlements  and  along  agricultural  lands,  the  ROW  is  encroached  by  adjoining  landowners. \nAn impact assessment and full census was conducted, based on the detailed designs (updated \nin  2013)  for  both  project  roads,  and  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  accordance  with \nnational  legal  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  According  to  the \ncensus survey, no affected household will be physically or economically displaced. \n\nAccording to resettlement plans, there will be no land acquisition, and key resettlement \n36. \nimpacts  include  partially  affected  structures  (permanent  structures  and  temporary  thatched \nsheds  or  kiosks)  and  trees  encroached  onto  the  ROW.  All  affected  households  will  restore  or \nrehabilitate  their  structures  at  the  same  place  outside  of  the  ROW  and  will  not  be  displaced \nphysically  or  economically.  The  project  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  insignificant  in  nature; \naffected  households  will  be  compensated for  all their  lost  assets  on  a replacement  cost  basis, \nand  income  restoration  support  will  be  provided  for  business  and  livelihood  losses.  The  total \nresettlement budget is estimated as PRs98.3 million. \n\n37. \nPublic consultation and information disclosure were undertaken during the preparation of \nresettlement  plans,  including  affected  persons  and  the  public  along  the  project  roads. \nThe  consultation  and  information-sharing  process  will  be  continued  throughout  project \nimplementation.  The  main  features  of  the  resettlement  plan\u2014project  impacts,  asset  valuation, \nentitlements,  and  compensation  provisions\u2014were  disclosed  to  project-affected  people  during \nconsultative  meetings.  An  information  booklet  was  prepared  in  the  local  language  and \ndistributed to project-affected people. The resettlement plan has been disclosed to the public via \nthe NHA and ADB websites. The NHA will regularly monitor implementation of the resettlement \nplans;  and the  result,  including social monitoring,  will  be  shared  with ADB quarterly  during the \nimplementation  phase  of \nthroughout  project \nimplementation after the resettlement plan has been implemented. \n\nresettlement  plans  and  semiannually \n\n38. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The project roads are located in the settled areas of Balochistan \nProvince,  with  no  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  Therefore,  no  indigenous  peoples  communities  will  be  affected  by  the  project. \nAccordingly, the project is classified category C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, with \nno indigenous peoples planning documents required. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in  detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.15 The  risks  are  assessed  manageable  by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \n\n \n\n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n10 \n\nRisks \nGovernment\u2019s development agenda for \nbalanced provincial development \ncompromised, and inadequate \ndevelopment budget allocated for \nBalochistan. \nGovernment\u2019s investments in transport \nsector in Balochistan erratically financed. \n\nPoor security and political instability \ndeteriorate and disrupt free flow of traffic. \n\nFew internationally qualified contractors \nand consultants are interested in the \nwork. \n \n\nThe procurement process is unduly \nprolonged because of governance issue \ninvolved in selection of contractors and \nconsultants. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe new government has reiterated its commitment to ensuring balanced \nprovincial development, focusing on underdeveloped provinces like \nBalochistan. A national consensus exists on the importance of engaging \nwith underdeveloped provinces to contain political and religious \ninsurgents. \nThe federal government is committed to rebalancing public investment in \nthe transport sector, which was skewed to provinces that were free from \nsecurity risks. \nThe project roads are located in relatively safe areas in Balochistan. \nSecurity protection measures in the former civil works contract in \nBalochistan, such as engaging local paramilitary agencies as security \nservice providers, proved effective\u2014with no security incident during \nproject implementation or after opening of the rehabilitated road. \nIn many past construction works, joint ventures of medium-sized \ninternational firms and qualified local firms carried out the works. In the \ncourse of construction, a few local firms proved their competence to build \nroads as designed. Civil works contracts are packaged to be suitable for \nthe same joint venture arrangement between medium-sized international \nfirms and competent local firms. Qualification requirements in the bidding \ndocuments will be carefully prepared to ensure that contractors with \nadequate financial and technical capacity are selected for civil works. \nThe new government ensures no political intervention in bidding for large-\nscale public works. The National Accountability Bureau is fully \nempowered to enforce the National Anticorruption Ordinance to prevent, \ndetect, investigate, and prosecute of cases involving corruption, corrupt \npractices, misuse and abuse of powers, misappropriation of property, \nkickbacks, and commissions. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  the  NHA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \n40. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n\nThe  government  and  the  NHA  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n41. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$195,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National  Highway  Network \nDevelopment in Balochistan Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n4 June 2014 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and Risks \nAssumptions \nGovernment\u2019s development \nagenda for balanced \nprovincial development \nintact, and adequate \ndevelopment budget \nallocated for Balochistan \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment\u2019s investments \nin transport sector in \nBalochistan financed \nsustainably \nRisk \nPoor security and political \ninstability disrupts \nconstruction work during \nimplementation and free \nflow of traffic after \ncompletion \nRisks \nFew internationally \nqualified contractors and \nconsultants are interested \nin the work \n\nThe procurement process \nis unduly prolonged \n\n \nSupervision \nconsultant\u2019s \nbaseline survey \n \nNHA traffic \nstatistics \n \nSupervision \nconsultant\u2019s \nproject progress \nreport and project \ncompletion report \n\nInputs \n\nLoan \nADB: $195,000,000 \n \nGovernment: $40,000,000 \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nAccessible, affordable, and \nsafe road network in \nBalochistan \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nNHA traffic \nstatistics \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \nwith Baselines \n\n \nAverage daily vehicle-km from Quetta \nto Peshawar via the N-50 and from \nQuetta to Multan via the N-70 \nincreased by 30% in the first full year of \noperation of two project roads (2013 \nbase line: 357,000 average daily \nvehicle-km for the N-50 and 248,000 \naverage daily vehicle-km for the N-70) \n\nOutcome \nReduced transport cost from \nBalochistan to the political \nand industrial centers of the \ncountry \n\nOutputs \n1.
