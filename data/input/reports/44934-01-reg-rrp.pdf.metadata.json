Under  the  program,  ADB  will  assume  a \nportion  of  the  default  risk  arising  under  loans  made  by  selected \npartner  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  to  microfinance  institutions \n(MFIs)  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  risk \nassumed by ADB will be up to 50% of the participated MFI loans. \nHowever,  in  exceptional  cases,  a  higher  percentage  may  be \nconsidered subject to ADB investment committee approval.  \n \nThis  risk  participation  program  will  facilitate  the  expansion  of \nexisting  PFI  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  program  will  be \navailable  for  5  years,  with  the  risk-participated  loans  to  MFIs \nhaving a maximum tenor of 3 years. The program could run up to \n8 years from the date of inception. \n \nInternational and local financial institutions supporting and funding \nmicrofinance in Asia.  \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  investment  will  support  the  expansion  of \nlending  to  MFIs  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  in  turn  providing  an  increase  in \nthe  provision  of  financial  services  to  the  underserved  poor \npopulation  segment.  This  will  help  address  the  significant  unmet \ndemand  for  financial  services,  and  provide  additional  funding  for \nmicro-borrowers.  \n\n(i) \n\nto \n\nincreased \n\nImpact.  The  transaction  will  lead  to  greater  access  to \nfinance  for  the  underserved  poor  population  segment, \ncontributing \nincomes  and  higher \nemployment,  economic  growth,  and  reduced  poverty  in \nADB\u2019s  DMCs.  The \ntransaction  will  also  promote \ndevelopment  of  the  microfinance  industry  by  widening \naccess  to  finance  for  borrowers  and  demonstrating  the \nviability of microfinance.   \n\n(ii) \n\nOutcome.  With  the  benefit  of  ADB\u2019s  unfunded  risk \nparticipation,  PFIs  will  be  able  to  expand  their  lending \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \nProposed ADB \nAssistance \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\n \nJustification / ADB \nValue Added \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nvolumes to MFIs. By meeting unmet demand from MFIs \nfor funding, increased and sustainable access to finance \nwill be provided to poor households in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n\n(iii) \n\nOutputs.  ADB  will \nimplement  a  risk  participation \nprogram  of  up  to  $250  million  that  will  enable  PFIs  to \nprovide  an  additional  $250  million  of  loans  to  MFI \ncustomers. \n\nthe \n\n(iv)  credit \n\nreference  borrowers; \n\n \nRisk participation program of up to $250 million for loans made by \ncommercial financial institutions to microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \nComprehensive  due  diligence  conducted  by  ADB  to  evaluate  the \nviability of the proposed transaction determined the risks overall to \nbe  acceptable  for  a  transaction  of  this  kind  in  the  microfinance \nsector.  The  main  risks  identified  are  (i)  risks  associated  with \nlending  to  MFIs;  (ii)  PFI  performance  risk;  (iii)  geographical \nconcentration  of \nrisks \nassociated  with  microfinance  lending;  and  (v)  foreign  exchange \nrisks. \n \nIn  a  transaction  of  this  nature,  these  risks  are  largely  mitigated \nthrough  selection  of  appropriate  and  responsible  PFIs  under  the \nprogram, with sound experience, strong underwriting practices and \npolicies,  and  an  established  track  record  in  lending  to  MFIs. \nDetailed  due  diligence  will  be  performed  on  each  PFI  before  its \nentry  into  the  program,  to  ensure  that  it  has  the  capacity  and \ncapability to manage these risks.    \n \nAfter 30 years of industry effort, a huge gulf remains between the \nsupply  and  demand  for  microfinance  services.  Commercial  banks \nface  restrictions  on  capital  and  counterparty  lines  that  limit  their \npossible  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  proposed  program  will \nprovide  capital  relief  to  PFIs  in  their  MFI  lending  operations, \nmaking additional lending to MFIs possible. This, in turn, will allow \nMFIs to provide greater access to financial services for the poor in \nAsia. \n \nOverall,  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  is  justified  by  the  significant \ndevelopment  impacts  that  increased  funding  to  MFIs  will  bring  to \nADB\u2019s  DMCs,  including  the  provision  of  financial  services  to  the \nunderbanked  population  segment,  and  the  resultant  improvement \nin quality of lives and livelihoods of the general population. \n \nMonitoring. The terms of the risk participation agreements entered \ninto with PFIs will require PFIs to submit financial and other reports \nto  ADB  on  the  MFI  portfolio  of  loans  participated  under  the \nprogram on a routine basis.   \n \nEvaluation.  Monitoring  reports  satisfactory \nsubmitted on an annual basis. \n\nto  ADB  will  be \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n\n1. \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program of up to $250 million.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Sector Background \n\n2. \nEmerging market financial institutions are growing at a rapid rate. However, this rate of \ngrowth  is  not  sufficient  to  accommodate  the  demand  for  capital  or  the  demand  for  banking \nproducts,  which  are  growing  at  far  greater  rates  throughout  developing  markets.  Asian \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  are  able  to  attract  financing  commensurate  with  their \npotential  size  can  grow  their  assets,  product  lines,  operational  efficiency,  and  management \ncapabilities to capitalize on the development that is taking place around them.   \n \nSustainable  and  large-scale  microfinance  can  only  be  achieved  if  financial  services  for \n3. \nthe  poor  are  integrated  into  overall  financial  systems.  Microfinance  has  proven  to  be  a  critical \nelement  of  an  effective  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  the  term  itself  refers  to  a  range  of \nfinancial  services  for  low-income  people,  including  credit,  savings,  insurance,  and  money \ntransfers. Microcredit plays an important role in helping the poor develop business opportunities \nand  mitigate  the  unreliability  of  their  income,1 and  MFIs  have  increased  in  number  and  size \naround the world as they seek to meet the significant unmet demand for financial services from \nthe  poor.  The  European  Commission  states  that  promoting  microfinance  is  an  important  and \nsignificant  part  of  its  development  policy. 2  World  leaders  also  affirmed  the  importance  of \nmicrofinance at the 2005 United Nations\u2019 General Assembly World Summit, where the Outcome \nDocument specifically referenced the need for access to financial services, in particular for the \npoor, including through microfinance and microcredit.3  \n \n4. \nMFIs  provide  financial  services  (loans,  savings  accounts,  insurance,  etc.)  to  poor  and \nunderserved  or  under-banked  populations  in  developing  economies.  One  of  the  most  popular \nmicrofinance  products  has  been  \u201cmicrocredit,\u201d  or  loans  in  relatively  small  amounts.  MFI  loan \nsizes  range  from  as  little  as  $50  up  to  several  thousand  dollars  or  more.  The  microlending \nmodality  has  been  highly  successful  in  extending  finance  to  previously  economically \ndisenfranchised people.4   \n \nWhile the argument for microfinance seems compelling, scientific testing of the impact of \n5. \nmicrofinance  has  proven  extremely  difficult.  Studies  in  the  area  have  provided  mixed  results, \nand the absence of control groups for comparison has led to significant debate about the validity \nof several studies.5 In addition, recent problems associated with borrower overindebtedness and \ncommercialization  of  microfinance  have  brought  some  organizations  within  the  industry  under \ncriticism. However, some studies continue to provide strong arguments advocating the benefits \n                                                 \n1   D.  Collins,  et  al.  2009.

Evidence provided in a new study (footnote 1) demonstrates the importance of \nmicrofinance  not  only  as  a  means  to  reduce  poverty,  but  also  as  a  means  of  improving  the \nquality of daily life within the condition of poverty.6 The study presents the results of year-long \nfinancial diaries (maintained by the  borrowers) collected twice a month  from hundreds of rural \nand  urban  households  in  Bangladesh,  India,  and  South  Africa.  These  diaries  reveal  that \nfinancial  instruments  are  critical  survivor  tools  for  poor  households,  and  that  these  tools  are \neven  more  important  for  the  poor  than  more  affluent  people  (footnote  5).  More  than  three \ndecades  of  industry  experience  also  demonstrates  that  microfinance  customers  not  only  take \nout loans, but repay them with high reliability, because of the borrowers\u2019 desire to retain access \nto  a  valued  service.  Clients  value  this  service  to  the  extent  that  they  are  willing  to  pay  higher \ninterest on loans and accept minimal or no return on savings.  \n \nGrowth  of  the  microfinance  industry.  There  is  no  standardized  system  to  which \n6. \nmicrofinance  providers  report  and  from  which  accurate  information  can  be  obtained,7 but  data \ncollected by the Microcredit Summit Campaign8 reveals that 3,552 global microcredit institutions \nhad  over  154  million  clients  by  the end  of  2007.  More  than  1,600  of  these  institutions  were  in \nAsia and the Pacific. However, the target population for microfinance services\u2014individuals living \non less than $2 per day and generally operating in the informal economy\u2014remains huge.9   \n \n7. \nAsian  microfinance  institutions. The growth reported by MFIs in Asia and the Pacific \nover  the  past  decade  provides  evidence  of  burgeoning  demand  in  the  microfinance  industry. \nMuch  of  this  growth  has  centered  on  the  Indian  and  Bangladesh  markets,  with  Bangladesh \ncurrently  being  home  to  the  three  largest  dedicated  MFIs  in  the  world.  The  Association  for \nSocial  Advancement  in  Bangladesh  had  over  4  million  active  borrowers  at  the  end  of  2009, \ncompared  to  1.1  million  at  the  end  of  1999.  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee \n(BRAC), also in Bangladesh, had more than 6.2 million active borrowers at the end of 2009, up \nfrom 2.6 million at the end of 1999. Rapid growth over the past decade in India has resulted in \nself-help groups now providing credit to over 10 million poor women. Using information gathered \nby the Microfinance Information eXchange (MIX), it can be observed in Figure 1 that growth in \nlending  by  Asian  MFIs  since  2000  has  been  substantial,  with  over  $10  billion  in  loans \noutstanding to more than 47 million borrowers by the end of 2008. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6   K.

Bangladesh, in particular, has \nmanaged to reach 35% of the country\u2019s poor, while MFIs in Sri Lanka and Viet Nam serve 25% \nof  the  poor  in  those  countries.10 A  number  of  Asian  MFIs  serve  several  million  clients  each.  \nMany  potential  microfinance  clients,  however,  continue  to  lack  access  to  basic  financial \nservices. In Cambodia and Indonesia, MFIs have reached only 10% of potential clientele, while \nin Afghanistan, India, and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the number is even smaller.11  \nUnderscoring this point is the fact that microfinance in Asia is a highly concentrated industry and \nin  2005  the  giants  (Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI),  BRAC,  and  the  Association  for  Social \nAdvancement) accounted for more than 50% of the total number of borrowers from more than \n300 MFIs worldwide that report to MIX.12 A dramatic gap still exists in Asia between the demand \nand supply of microfinance products, pointing to a need for more and larger MFIs.   \n \n9. \nHuge global financing gap in lending to microfinance institutions. Microfinance has \nevolved  into  a  powerful  tool  to  reduce  poverty.  As  outlined  above,  while  the  growth  of  the \nmicrofinance  industry  has  been  substantial,  after  three  decades  of  evolution,  many  of  the \nworking poor are still without access to microfinance services. At present growth rates, this gap \nwill not close for many decades. For microfinance to reach full potential in its ability to reduce \npoverty, the microfinance industry must grow to scale. \n\n                                                 \n10 There are a number of ways of measuring microfinance penetration; this statistic is specific to percentage of poor \n\npeople served, rather than the population overall. \n\n11 International  Finance  Corporation.

Practitioners also estimate that the total amount of funding \nrequired  to  meet  the  latent  demand  is  $250  billion\u2013$300  billion.14 Despite  these  being  global \nestimates, their relevance in considering the funding gap in the Asian region is clear given that \nAsia  and  the  Pacific  is  home  to  two-thirds  of  the  world\u2019s  poor. 15  Furthermore,  various \ndemographic  and  economic  conditions  in  developing  countries\u2014such  as  population  growth, \nlarge  proportions  of  youth,  limited  education  and  skills  training,  increased  rural  to  urban \nmigration, and insufficient ability of the formal sector to absorb new workers\u2014suggest that the \namount of potential microfinance clients will continue to grow.   \n \n11. \nRestrictions on growth for microfinance institutions. The greatest inhibitor to growth \nof the microfinance industry is that the vast majority of MFIs lack the funding required to grow \nfurther.  Although  the  industry  has  demonstrated  that  MFIs  can  be  a  self-sustaining  business, \nmost  still  rely  on  donor  funding,  which  is  limited  in  supply.  Without  access  to  further  capital \nsources,  growth  ceases  once  the  grant  money  is  onlent.  MFIs  must  access  large  amounts  of \nadditional  capital  to  expand  operations  and  initiate  greater  reach  to  poor  borrowers.  The  only \nsource for these resources is the formal banking sector. \n \n12. \nBanking  market  as  source  of  funds  for  microfinance  institutions. Formal financial \ninstitutions  are  therefore  increasingly  important  in  the  context  of  microfinance  given  their \ncapacity  to  leverage  their  capital  and  grow  their  operations.  For  several  mainstream \ninternational  banks,  such  as  Standard  Chartered  Bank,  Citibank,  Deutsche  Bank,  HSBC,  and \nBNP Paribas, lending to microfinance institutions is one of many business lines. The entrance of \nthese institutions into microfinance provides not only a much needed source of funding for MFIs, \n\n                                                 \n13 Langer  W.  2008.

These institutions also possess vast infrastructure and are in a good position to offer \nand  develop  further  benefits  from  synergies  between  microloans  and  other  services  they \nalready offer.16   \n \nB. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n13. \nThe microfinance industry faces several challenges. Among the most critical are (i) that \nMFIs  have  limited  access  to  finance,  particularly  long-term  funding;  and  (ii)  that  most  of  the \navailable funding is in foreign currency, exposing MFIs to foreign exchange risks that they are \nnot typically positioned to manage appropriately.  \n \nInternational financial institutions  (IFIs) as well as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) \n14. \nprovide loans to Asian MFIs as part of their emerging markets lending business and to promote \nmicrofinance lending in the region. These institutions include leading Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  banks,  foundations,  trusts,  and  asset  managers, \nfocused  on  lending  to  MFIs.  These  institutions  actively  pursue  business  opportunities  that \noverlap  with  development  financial  institution  (DFI)  mandates  in  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) lending, microfinance, and environmental finance. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  has  approached  several  such  potential  partner  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  and \nrequested that they consider cooperation on a purely Asian MFI portfolio through a risk-sharing \narrangement that would enable these institutions to lend greater volumes into the microfinance \nsector. This would allow ADB to be a key player in partnership with these financial institutions in \nthe  microfinance  sector  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  while  making  use  of \nthe institution\u2019s origination and loan processing capabilities.    \n \n15. \nAll  participating  banks  will  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  investment  committee.  In  addition  to \ninternational commercial banks active in financing MFIs in Asia, the program will target domestic \nfinancial institutions in ADB\u2019s DMCs that are engaged in wholesale MFI funding. The program \nwill be marketed in the respective DMCs accordingly. Under the program, ADB will acquire, on \nan  unfunded  basis,  participations  in  loans  made  to  MFIs  by  PFIs.  Such  risk  participation  will \nfacilitate expansion of existing lending volumes to MFIs by these PFIs. Under the program, ADB \nwill  acquire  participations  of  up  to  50%  of  the  default  risk  of  loans  made  by  the  PFI  to  MFI \ncustomers  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  In  exceptional  cases,  a  higher  percentage  may  be  considered \nsubject to ADB investment committee\u2019s approval.  \n \nKey  features  of  the  proposed  program  would  include  (i)  a  risk  participation  agreement \n16. \nthat  would  cover  term  facilities  of  up  to  3  years;  and  (ii)  risk  coverage  for  PFI  loans  that  are \nmostly  denominated  in  local  currency  (and  sourced  through  the  PFIs\u2019  branch  network).  By \nentering into a risk participation agreement with ADB, a PFI will continue to make loans in local \ncurrency while being able to double its allowable lending volumes to MFIs. This risk participation \nagreement will not only provide the PFIs with ADB\u2019s backing and support, but will also catalyze \nincremental lending to MFIs operating in ADB\u2019s DMCs. Furthermore, ADB has several years of \nexperience  with  this  type  of  facility,  including  SME  risk  participation  in  Pakistan  and  the \nPhilippines,  as  well  as  the  Trade  Finance  Program  (TFP),  under  which  ADB  provides  risk \ncoverage to international banks to support international trade transactions. However, this will be \nthe  first  time  that  ADB  will  be  rolling  out  a  risk  participation  program  of  this  scale  targeted \nspecifically for private sector MFIs. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 E.

Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nFinancial sector development is listed as one of five core specializations for operational \n17. \nfocus under Strategy 202017 that best supports ADB\u2019s agenda, reflects DMCs\u2019 needs and ADB\u2019s \ncomparative  strengths,  and  complements  efforts  by  development  partners.  Under  Strategy \n2020, ADB will strengthen its support to the finance sector at the regional and national levels by \nhelping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  To  promote \ninclusive  growth,  ADB  will  seek  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  microfinance,  rural \nfinancial institutions, and SMEs, and will explore the use of technologies to expand the reach of \nthe  formal  financial  system  to  rural  areas.  The  proposed  transaction  supports  institutional  and \nfinancial  sector  development,  particularly  in  the  area  of  microfinance,  and  directly  supports \nADB\u2019s strategy of expanding the reach of the formal financial system to rural and underserved \nareas. \n \nThe proposed project also supports the operational and institutional goal under Strategy \n18. \n2020  to  scale  up  private  sector  development  and  private  sector  operations  in  all  operational \nareas, to reach 50% of annual operations by 2020.  \n \n\n2.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n\n19. \nSupporting financial sector development is a key focus of developmental assistance for \nADB,  in  line  with  the  tenets  detailed  in  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy 18 and \nenhanced  poverty  reduction  strategy,19 which  note  improved  economic  growth,  stimulated  by \nprivate sector investment, as a key contributing factor in reducing poverty. ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  refers  specifically  to  ADB\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  the  financial  sector  in \nDMCs.  The  strategy  notes  the  critical  importance  of  well  functioning  financial  systems  for  the \ndevelopment of the private sector, which in turn underpins sustainable economic growth. Many \nDMCs need to strengthen their financial institutions and create diversified financial markets that \ncan finance private sector-led growth.  \n    \nThe proposed program is consistent with the overall sector strategy in that it will help in \n20. \nthe  development  of  the  microfinance  sector  and  increase  access  to  financial  services  for  the \npoor\u2014making  private  sector  development  more  sustainable  and  ADB\u2019s  mission  of  poverty \nreduction  more  achievable.  The  proposed  intervention  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  recently \ndeveloped business plan for private sector capital markets initiatives, under which microfinance \nhas been elevated to a core focus area. The proposed project is also viewed as complementary \nto  a  proposed  equity  investment  in  ShoreCap  II  Limited,  which  is  currently  being  processed. \nThrough  this  fund,  ADB  seeks  to  promote  development  by  providing  financial  support  to  MFIs \n(and small business banks). \n \n21. \nFinally,  the  proposed  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  overarching  poverty  reduction \nstrategy,  which  states  that  ADB  seeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and \ncapital markets,\u201d since these are seen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2008.

Although  the  program  was  considered  appropriate  in  terms  of \nmarket  need,  there  were  several  challenges  in  implementation  and  the  program  remained \nalmost  85%  unutilized.  Only  one  loan  was  disbursed,  to  INECO  Bank  in  Armenia.  The  limited \nsuccess of the program was due to the length of time taken to agree terms and document the \npotential  loans  under  the  program,  the  lack  of  availability  of  ADB  human  resources  to  invest \nsignificant  time  on  several  small  individual  loans,  and  the  growing  need  for  local  currency \nfunding as opposed to foreign currency loans. A programmatic approach as contemplated under \nthis program, can address these concerns by utilizing the resources and comparative advantage \nof a third party institution that has access to local currency and a strong presence on the ground \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n\n4.  Consistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n\nin  strategically  selected \n\nADB  has  supported  financial  sector  reform  programs  both  through  public  sector \n23. \noperations  and/or  direct  private  sector \nfinancial \ninvestments \nintermediaries  in  several  DMCs.  The  proposition  is  to  leverage  the  significant  work  already \nundertaken  by  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  in  this  sector,  and  will  involve  close  collaboration \nwith them in (i) establishing regional teams to identify priority countries; (ii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s \nrelationships  with  key  government  bodies,  including  central  banks  and  finance  ministries;  and \n(iii) identifying key participants (PFIs and MFIs) in respective countries, and introducing them to \nthis program and its related benefits.  \n \n24. \nADB  has  supported  microfinance  and  micro  and  small  enterprise  (MSE)  initiatives  for \nalmost  two  decades.  Since  1988,  ADB  has  approved  32  microfinance  specific  projects \n(aggregating  to  $1.9  billion  in  financing)  and  66  TA  projects.  In  2000,  recognizing  that  the \nindustry landscape had changed, ADB formulated and approved the Microfinance Development \nStrategy (MDS), which provides a consistent and comprehensive framework and guides ADB\u2019s \nmicrofinance operations.21  \n \nThe  MDS  aims  to  ensure  permanent  access  to  institutional  financial  services  for  a \n25. \nmajority  of  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their  microenterprises.  The  purpose  is  to \nsupport  the  development  of  sustainable  microfinance  systems  that  can  provide  diverse,  high-\nquality  services.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy  environment  conducive  to \nmicrofinance,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable  institutions,  (iv) \nsupporting pro-poor innovations, and (v) supporting social intermediation. The MDS states that \nADB  will  catalyze  expanding  the  supply  of  microfinance  by  focusing  on  building  financial \nsystems  that  can  grow  and  provide  financial  services  on  a  permanent  basis  to  an  increasing \nproportion of the poor. The MDS encourages ADB to, among other things, support development \nof  viable  institutions  that  can  set  in  motion  a  process  of  commercialization  of  microfinance \nservices.22 \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.  2007.

ADB\u2019s mission is poverty reduction in its DMCs, and each intervention that the \nbank  undertakes  should  relate\u2014either  directly  or  indirectly,  and  immediately  or  over  the  long-\nterm\u2014to  achievement  of  that  mission.  In  this  transaction,  ADB\u2019s  sharing  of  risk  with  PFIs \nengaged in lending to MFIs is ultimately intended, over the long term, to help increase economic \ncontribution by microfinance clients and small businesses to growth in the region, as well as to \nincrease  access  of  the  poor  to  finance.  This  set  of  linkages  is  detailed  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). Furthermore, as many MFIs focus on lending to women as \na group, or provide credit to microenterprises run by women, this program intends to track this \ndata across the MFIs that will be part of this program. MIX, a growing source for financial and \nsocial performance data that a large number of Asian MFIs report to, tracks information specific \nto  women.  As  the  program  will  cover  several  countries,  PFIs,  and  MFIs,  it  is  not  possible  to \nforecast the overall impact on women accurately. However, it is possible to monitor the impact \non women through MIX and the intention is to report this data on a regular basis.      \n \n\n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n27. \nThe proposed intervention by ADB will allow PFIs to increase their volumes of lending in \nthe microfinance sector and remain in compliance with imposed lending limits, thereby granting \naccess  to  credit  for  MFIs  and  their  borrowers.  Loans  provided  by  MFIs  are  frequently  used  to \nexpand  the  operations  of  micro-  and  small  businesses,  translating  directly  into  job  creation, \noften for those at the lower end of the income spectrum. The combination of additional micro-\nentrepreneurs and small businesses doing incremental business and employing additional staff \nwill contribute to rising incomes, higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and ultimately a \nlower  incidence  of  poverty.  The  financing  will  also  assist  micro  businesses  to  expand  and  at \nsome point enter the formal economy, thus beginning to pay taxes that DMC governments can \ndirect toward much needed social services and infrastructure requirements. \n \n28.  MSE development directly strengthens the economic activities of poor households, while \nhelping  them  build  diverse  assets  and  cope  with  emergencies  and  other  risks.  In  developing \ncountries,  microenterprises  are  the  main  source  of  jobs  for  poor  people\u2014microenterprises \nconsist of 80% of total enterprises, 50% of urban enterprises, and 20% of gross national product \nfor developing countries worldwide.23 Development of the MSE sector therefore yields powerful \nreturns to the economy  as a whole. A critical  aspect of this strategy is developing sustainable \nfinancial services that support MSEs and meet low-income families\u2019 needs for credit.24 \n \n29. \nBroadening  access  to  financial  markets  for  microfinance  institutions  and  their \ncustomers. Modern microfinance has evolved over the past 30 years to become an industry of \nsignificant scale. However, a more commercial industry must be built to reduce the still immense \ngap  between  the  demand  and  supply  of  sustainable  financial  services  to  the  poor  through \nsustainable  and  innovative  approaches.  Creating  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable \nmicrofinance and building strong retail capacity remain the most critical needs in many countries \nin the Asian region.25  \n                                                 \n23 ResponsAbility  Global  Microfinance  Fund.  2005.

Since  loans  to  MFIs  tend  to  be  small  compared  to  more \nmainstream  banks  and  corporate  entities,  and  since  the  origination  of  loans  to  MFIs  typically \ntakes place in emerging markets that require specialized credit skills on the part of the lending \nbanks,  origination  of  loans  to  MFIs  is  comparatively  expensive  and  the  number  of  originating \nbanks is limited. Through ADB\u2019s proposed risk participation arrangement, commercial financing \ninstitutions  that  are  developing  microfinance  operations  will  be  able  to  achieve  greater  scale \nwithout overextending their risk exposure, thereby creating additional financing opportunities for \nMFIs which leads to greater access to finance for micro-borrowers.  \n \nGreater financial inclusion. The provision or expansion of financial services to poor or \n31. \ndisadvantaged people previously unable to gain access is known as \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and is \nincreasingly  being  seen  as  important  to  poverty  reduction  and  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).26 Through borrowing and saving, the poor can plan for their future \nbeyond  the  short  term.  They  can  accumulate  assets  and  invest  in  productive  enterprises, \neducation, and health. Financial services can help them cope in times of hardship. Beyond the \ntangible  aspects,  access  to  financial  services  promotes  social  inclusion,  and  builds  self-\nconfidence and empowerment, particularly for women. In Bangladesh, according to MIX27, 274 \nMFIs have over 25 million borrowers, covering 17% of the total population and 35% of the poor \npopulation.  Approximately 90% of these MFI clients are women and 89% of them reside in rural \nareas.  Similarly,  in  Pakistan28,  the  outreach  effort  of  the  microfinance  sector  has  resulted  in  2 \nmillion active borrowers, out of which nearly 50% are women. Comparable outreach to women \ncan also be seen in several other countries, including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.29 \n \n32. \nLimited  access  to  financial  services  can  be  a  major  constraint  to  the  participation  and \ncontribution  of  the  poor  to  economic  growth.  A  recent  report  from  the  World  Bank  studying \nSouth  Asia,  shows  that  countries  in  this  region  lag  far  behind  international  benchmarks  with \nrespect to key indicators for financial access. A large portion of the population, most notably the \nlow income population, does not have adequate access to formal financial services (based on \npeople per branch, number of ATMs, and number of loan and deposit accounts). Over 58% of \nthe  adult  population  (or  612  million  people)  in  South  Asia  fall  in  this  category  (footnote  29). \nGreater  levels  of  financial  inclusion  can  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of  low-income \nhouseholds by helping them meet basic needs, protecting against risks and economic shocks.    \n      \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nADB\u2019s  proposed \n\nintervention  will  make  a  direct  contribution \n\n33. \nto  private  sector \ndevelopment by encouraging and promoting such mechanisms as (i) enhanced disclosure and \nreporting standards; (ii) enhanced data gathering and collation, particularly with respect to credit \ninformation;  (iii)  increasing  the  volume  of  funding  being  provided  to  private  sector  institutions \nengaged  in  microfinance  lending;  and  (iv)  an  increased  share  of  nonsovereign  financial \ninstitution assets in the total assets of the financial sectors of DMCs. The proposed transaction \nwill  in  this  manner  help  DMCs  meet  their  objectives  with  respect  to  their  private  sector  and \nfinancial sector development strategies.  \n\n                                                 \n26 Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). 2010.

Increasing the level of financial resources that \nPFIs can allocate to microfinance will help the PFIs to develop robust and market leading MFI \nlending  operations,  thereby  strengthening  and  extending  the  reach  of  the  commercial \nmicrofinance sector as a whole. Through successful development and expansion of operations \nin  this  market  segment,  PFIs  will  signal  to  other  potential  commercial  lenders  that  lending  to \nMFIs  can  be  done  in  a  sustainable  and  profitable  manner.  This  will  encourage  other  financial \ninstitutions  to  engage  in  MFI  lending  directly.  As  more  institutions  enhance  operations  in  the \nsector, it will help stimulate greater competition in the microfinance wholesale lending business, \nleading to increased efficiency and provision of financing at more competitive pricing over time.  \n \n\n3.  Outputs and Outcome \n\n \n\na. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n \n35.  With the assistance of a risk participation agreement between ADB and PFIs, such PFIs \nwill  be  able  to  expand  their  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  Through  meeting  unmet  demand  from \nMFIs for funding, increased and sustainable access to finance will ultimately be provided to poor \nhouseholds in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n \n \n \n36. \nADB  will  implement  a  $250  million  risk  participation  program  that  will  enable  PFIs  to \nprovide an additional $250 million of funding to MFI customers. Given that the risk participation \nprogram will be available for a period of 5 years, the expected turnover under this could be in \nexcess of $600 million. \n \n\nOutput \n\nb. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nPARTNER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  \n\n37. \nADB  will  work  with  select  partner  financial  institutions  (PFI)  under  the  proposed  risk \nparticipation  program.  Targeted  PFIs  will  include  both  international  and  domestic  financial \ninstitutions that engage in MFI wholesale lending as a core business. Each PFI selected under \nthe  program  will  have  experience  in  MFI  lending,  and  be  a  market  leader  in  the  microfinance \nlending  segment.  PFIs  must  also  have  an  expressed  willingness  to  broaden  their  Asian  MFI \ncustomer base. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is an example of such an institution and ADB \nis  in  discussions  with  them  in  relation  to  this  program.  Each  PFI  will  undergo  detailed  due \ndiligence by ADB. Each PFI under the program will be approved by ADB\u2019s Management.  At a \nminimum, each PFI will be required to meet the standards listed in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Partnership Financial Institution Criteria for  \nMicrofinance Risk Participation Program \n \n\nCredit Standards \nCredit rating of BB or higher (or equivalent) from at least \none international credit rating agency and/or recognized by \nindustry as a key player in microfinance sector (CGAP, IFC, \nand other MDBs) \n\nReputable and sound ownership, management, and \ngovernance standards (including composition of the board \nof directors) \nDedicated approach to the sector \n\nMFI Lending Experience \n\nAt least 3 years of lending to MFIs in ADB DMCs \n\nAcceptable underwriting and servicing platforms in \nplace \n\nDedicated MFI teams at both relationship manager as \nwell as risk management levels \n\nPasses detailed ADB due diligence and ADB investment \ncommittee approval \n\nWell performing MFI portfolio with NPLs of less than \n5% \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CGAP  =  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor,  DMC  =  developing  member \ncountry,  IFC  =  International  Finance  Corporation,  MDB  =  multilateral  development  bank,  MFI  =  microfinance \ninstitution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSource: ADB. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n \nA. \n\nThe ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n\n38. \nThe proposed project is a risk participation program of up to $250 million for loans made \nto MFIs. The objective of the program is to cover payment default risk on loans made by PFIs to \nMFIs  in  ADB  DMCs.  The  risk  participation  agreement  entered  into  with  respective  PFIs  is \nexpected  to  cover  up  to  50%  of  the  default  risk  of  the  MFIs  covered  under  the  program.  In \nexceptional  cases,  a  higher  percentage  may  be  considered  subject  to  ADB  investment \ncommittee approval. The program will be available for 5 years, with participated loans to MFIs \nhaving a maximum tenor of 3 years. Accordingly, the program could run up to 8 years from the \ndate  of  inception.  In  some  cases,  particularly  in  emerging  developing  economies,  ADB  may \nassume a higher portion of the risk, to encourage PFIs to lend where there is a significant lack \nof access to finance for MFIs. Under the risk sharing arrangement, ADB would create additional \nheadroom  for  PFIs  to  increase  lending  volumes  under  PFI  country  and  individual  MFI  limits. \nFigure 3 details how the risk participation arrangements will operate. \n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n39. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nADB will acquire risk participations from PFIs, with the following features and conditions: \n\nADB will consider each PFI\u2019s recommendations on MFIs that it intends to place \nunder  this  program.  At  a  minimum,  the  PFIs  will  confirm  to  ADB  that  the  MFI \nmeets all of the PFI\u2019s credit and underwriting requirements, as well as social and \nenvironmental  standards.  ADB  will  not  conduct  detailed  independent  due \ndiligence  and  evaluations  on  these  MFIs,  but  rather  an  abbreviated  desktop \nreview  to  determine  whether  to  accept  the  MFI  into  the  program.  ADB  will \nprimarily rely on the PFI\u2019s credit process, its extensive industry experience, and \nits relationships with the MFIs.  \nUnder a risk participation agreement, ADB will typically assume 50% of the risk \nof MFI payment default. \nThe  risk  participation  agreement  will  provide  ADB  cover  in  US  dollars,  even \nthough underlying MFI loans are usually in local currency.   \nADB will participate in existing loans outstanding to MFIs, as well as new loans.  \nThis will enable the PFI to increase its lending limit to existing relationships that it \nhas  experience  with,  and  allow  loans  to  additional  MFIs  that  meet  its  lending \ncriteria. Conversely, it will provide ADB with the comfort of dealing with a mature \nportfolio  and  over  a  period  of  time,  give  ADB  the  reassurance  of  possibly \nexpanding the facility to cover smaller and slightly riskier MFIs. \nNo watchlisted and/or classified accounts will be eligible. \nADB will also require periodic reports from the PFI to update progress on loans \nparticipated  under  the  program,  particularly  with  respect  to  utilization  and \nmeeting portfolio growth targets. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n40.  Microfinance,  since  its  inception  in  1970s,  has  evolved  into  a  powerful  tool  to  reduce \npoverty. Based on the belief that the poor have the capacity to transform their lives, once given \nthe opportunity, MFIs have been able to reach over 100 million of the world\u2019s poor by the end of \n2007\u2014touching the lives of an estimated half a billion family members (footnote 9). \n \n41. \nHowever, even after 30 years of industry effort, a huge gulf remains between the supply \nand demand for microfinance services. According to the European Commission, as many as 3 \nbillion people still lack access to formal financial services and at current growth rates, the gap \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nwill  not  be  closed  for  decades.  For  microfinance  to  achieve  its  potential  as  a  global  poverty \nreduction tool, the microfinance industry must grow to scale.30  \n \n42. \nCommercial  banks  face  restrictions  on  capital  and  counterparty  lines  that  limit  their \npossible  lending  volumes  to  MFIs.  The  proposed  facility  complements  ADB\u2019s  existing  direct-\nlending  activities  to  the  MFI  industry  through  financial  intermediation  by  making  possible \nadditional lending by PFIs to MFIs. This, in turn, will deepen access by MFIs to financing, and \nsupport their lending activities, thus broadening access to these MFIs by the poor in Asia. The \neffects therefore include both a broadening and deepening of MFI lending. Given the reluctance \nof many lending financial institutions to provide long-term funding to MFIs because of perceived \nrisks  associated  with  microfinance  broadly,  through  the  proposed  intervention,  ADB  will  help \nincrease  the  capacity  of  commercial  banks  in  the  area  of  MFI  lending.  This  will  have  the \nimportant  multiplier  effect  of  encouraging  other  commercial  lenders  to  provide  financing  to \ninstitutions that are engaged in, or considering becoming engaged in, providing funding to MFIs.    \n\n \nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nC. \n\n43.  Microfinance  has  proven  to  be  a  critical  element  of  an  effective  poverty  reduction \nstrategy  and  the  term  \u201cmicrofinance\u201d  refers  to  a  range  of  financial  services  for  low-income \npeople, including credit, savings, insurance, and money transfers. MFIs could comprise licensed \nand  unlicensed  financial  institutions  that  include  NGOs,  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and \ncooperatives, and agricultural and postal saving banks. Given this, the credit risk that ADB will \nundertake will be on (i) the underlying MFIs; (ii) the PFIs\u2019 ability to select strong and sustainable \nMFIs;  (iii)  the  PFIs\u2019  internal  credit  and  risk  management  processes;  (iv)  the  quality  of \nmanagement  information  systems  (MIS);  and  (v)  the  management  team.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence \nprocess will cover all of these areas for each PFI considered under the program.  \n \n44. \nIn  addition  to  the  inherent  risks  associated  with  emerging  markets  investments  and  in \nparticular to the microfinance sector, risks embedded in the transaction, and potential mitigants, \nwill include those listed below.      \n\n \n45. \nRisks  related  to  MFIs.  There  are  risks  associated  with  the  creditworthiness  of  the \nunderlying  MFIs.  These  include  the  level  of  demand  for  microfinance  borrowing,  liquidity  and \nfinancial  sustainability,  and  operational  and  governance  risks.  Credit  risk  at  the  MFI  level  can \nalso be influenced by overindebtedness among microfinance borrowers, given the lack of credit \ndata available in the microfinance sector and the absence of credit bureaus in many countries. \nThere  also  tends  to  be  inconsistencies  in  the  method  of  financial  reporting  by  MFIs.  ADB  will \nutilize internal ratings performed by PFIs that are mapped to the default frequency and external \nrating scale of international rating agencies where available to assist in comparing MFI standing \nand  performance.  However,  in  certain  instances  where  PFIs  do  not  have  an  internal  rating \nscale, a more rigorous approach will be followed in assessing the credit risk of individual MFIs. \nSome  MFIs  have  also  experienced  difficulties  in  managing  growth  and  expanding  into  new \nproduct lines, which will be carefully assessed during the credit review process.  \n \nThe risks associated with individual MFIs and their operations are best managed through \n46. \nin-depth knowledge of the institution and the environment in which the MFI operates. Through \ntheir  regional  network,  personnel  on  the  ground,  and  close  borrower  contact,  PFIs  are  best \npositioned to assess and manage this risk. ADB will therefore rely to a large extent on the PFIs\u2019 \nexperience  in  their  markets,  and  the  PFIs\u2019  rigorous  underwriting  and  monitoring  standards  to \n\n                                                 \n30 Unitus.  Why \n\nmicrofinance/why-the-poor-still-lack-access \n\nthe  Poor  Still  Lack  Access.  http://www.unitus.com/unitus-in-action/background-poverty-and-\n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\nmitigate risks related to the individual MFIs. ADB\u2019s due diligence of the PFIs\u2019 internal standards \nand  systems  therefore  forms  a  critical  component  of  ensuring  MFI  risks  are  managed \nappropriately.     \n \nPartner  financial  institution  performance  risk.  As  stated,  ADB  will  substantially  rely \n47. \non the operational and business judgment of PFIs given their industry experience and expertise. \nThe  PFI  remains  the  loan  originator  and  servicer,  so  adequate  credit  quality  of  the  PFI  is \nimportant for continued maintenance of the facility. Financial difficulties with the PFI could impair \nits  ability  to  process  and  manage  the  MFI  loan  portfolio.  The  ability  of  PFIs  to  maintain \nacceptable ongoing performance levels may therefore be impacted by such issues as changes \nin  risk  appetite,  staffing  and  recruitment,  maintenance  of  credit  underwriting  and  monitoring \nprocedures,  and  market  forces.  With  these  concerns,  ADB  will  endeavor  to  select  PFIs  with \nsound MFI assessment and monitoring systems, a solid track record of building an MFI portfolio \nand  one  that  has  an  acceptable  credit  profile  as  determined  by  the  selection  criteria  for  PFIs \n(Table 1). Further, through equal sharing of risk between ADB and the PFI in most cases, the \nPFI will be sufficiently incentivized to maintain high loan origination and monitoring standards. \n    \n48. \nRegulatory and reputation risk. The MFI industry in many DMCs may not yet operate \nwithin  a  robust  regulatory  framework,  and  MFIs  may  therefore  be  susceptible  to  political \ninterference. MFIs have also been criticized for charging high interest rates, leading to calls in \nsome countries for interest rate caps and requests for debt forgiveness to distressed borrowers. \nPoliticians have also questioned the practices and collection methods of certain MFIs. There is \npotential reputation risk for ADB if the MFIs selected under the program are engaged in illegal \nand unethical lending practices. In consultation with PFIs, ADB will assess the suitability of each \nMFI client, and take into account the local regulatory and political environment in ADB\u2019s review \nprocess. Furthermore, to ensure that the portfolio meets the above standards, ADB will conduct \nstringent  due  diligence  on  PFIs  to  ensure  that  each  PFI  has  an  appropriate  screening \nmechanism for MFIs.  The due diligence will, amongst other areas, evaluate that in selecting the \nMFI,  the  PFI  has  ensured  that  the  underlying  MFIs  are  legitimate  and    indisputable,  are \nrespected and well reputed and have an outreach and social agenda that they are able to report \non and monitor. \n \nGeographical  concentration  of  the  reference  entities.  The  MFIs  conduct  their \n49. \nbusiness in limited countries throughout Asia. The geographical concentration of the MFIs may \ntherefore  result  in  a  greater  risk  of  loss  than  if such  concentration  had  not  been  present.  This \nrisk  can  be  managed  through  analysis  of  the  reference  MFI  portfolios  when  new  PFIs  are \nconsidered  under  the  program,  and  through  reaching  agreement  with  PFIs  on  new  target \ncountries and new MFIs for participation under the program. Eligibility criteria can also be built \ninto  terms  agreed  with  PFIs  to  ensure  underlying  exposure  does  not  become  overly \nconcentrated in particular geographic locations, or to specific MFIs being funded by more than \none PFI. Furthermore, geographic concentration risk will be safeguarded by internal reviews of \nexposure limits for MFIs in each country. \n \n50. \nCredit risks of micro-loans. All of the loans covered under the program will be to MFIs \nthat extend credit to micro-entrepreneurs and microenterprises in developing countries. Most of \nthese  micro-borrowers  have  low  incomes  and  little  or  no  previous  credit  history.  History  has \nshown that risks associated with microloans can be managed through features such as group \nlending  models  and  taking  certain  types  of  collateral.  MFIs  have  also  started  to  lend  to \nmicroenterprises based on enterprise cash flows. Therefore, selection of MFIs with an ability to \nassess  these  risks  is  important  for  PFIs.  The  PFIs\u2019  own  standards  for  underwriting  and \nmanaging their MFI lending portfolio are therefore critical to ADB in the context of the program.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n51. \nForeign  exchange  rate  risk.  The  underlying  MFI  loans  will,  in  most  cases,  be \ndenominated  in  local  currency,  while  the  guarantee  is  denominated  in  US  dollars.  Foreign \nexchange  rates  will  be  set  at  the  transaction  closing  date  when  loans  are  first  included  in  the \nreference  portfolio.  PFIs  will  ensure  that  single  borrower  and  overall  country  limits  are  not \nbreached  when  setting  these  rates.  Furthermore,  in  the  event  of  default,  ADB  will  be  liable  to \npay  at  the  prevailing  rate.  In  a  scenario  where  the  local  currency  has  appreciated  against  the \nUS dollar, ADB\u2019s liability under the program could be greater for that specific MFI borrower than \nwhat had earlier been anticipated and/or approved. However, at no time will ADB\u2019s exposure to \nrisk covered under agreement with a PFI be greater than the pre-determined limit agreed with \nthat  PFI.  To  ensure  that  ADB  does  not  exceed  its  single  borrower  or  country  limits,  ADB  will \nrequire PFIs to submit regular reports on exposure covered by ADB. \n \n52. \nCapacity risk. Under the programmatic approach of the proposed transaction, ADB will \nplace some level of reliance on PFIs to underwrite and monitor the MFI loans, and will therefore \nbenefit from a resource perspective through effective outsourcing of these functions. However, \nin addition to performing detailed due diligence on each PFI to determine their suitability for the \nprogram, ADB will also still be required to undertake a review of each underlying MFI and MFI \nloan  in  order  to  ensure  maintenance  of  appropriate  risk  levels  commensurate  with  ADB \nstandards. This will have potential resource implications for ADB that will need to be managed \nin the context of expansion of the program.    \n \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n53. \nThe  proposed  project  will  be  classified  as  financial  intermediary  and  will  be  treated  as \ncategory  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  Given the nature of microfinance operations, environmental \nimpacts are expected to be negligible and no involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous \npeoples  are  foreseen.  ADB  will  determine  the  level  of  oversight  required  to  verify  compliance \nduring the due diligence exercise conducted on each PFI and its MFI lending operations. The \nfirst  potential  PFI,  SCB,  was  viewed  as  having  robust  internal  environmental  and  social \nscreening practices, through the use of its environmental and social risk assessment tool. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n54.  Monitoring.  In  keeping  with  the  arrangements  for  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  guarantees, \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division will be responsible for the \nmonitoring of this investment. All participating PFIs will provide ADB with financial reports at pre-\ndetermined  regular  intervals  and  as  requested.  ADB  will  review  these  reports  on  an  ongoing \nbasis and monitor the value of its exposure accordingly.    \n \nEvaluation.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  regular \n55. \nbasis, but at least annually. The first such report will be submitted no later than 12 months after \napproval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.   \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n56. \nAll PFIs will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \nthe Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\nPFIs  to  have  instituted,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  PFIs  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  program  will  be  within  the  approved  medium-term,  country,  industry, \n\n57. \ngroup, and single project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nE. \n\nAssurances \n\nNo-objection \n\nletter.  Consistent  with \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n58. \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  the  government  of  each  country  in  which  MFIs  borrowing  under  the \nprogram  are  located  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance.  No participation under the program in such country will be made effective until ADB \nreceives such confirmation.   \n \n59. \nDocumentation.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  risk  participation  agreements  and  other \nrequired legal documents once the proposed program is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \nand the individual PFIs are approved by the ADB investment committee. These agreements will \nbe on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n60. \nI am satisfied that the proposed risk participation program would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank  (ADB) and  recommend  that the Board approve \nthe Microfinance Risk Participation Program of up to $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n\n22 November 2010 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n17\n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpacts \n \nIncreased economic \ncontribution to the \nAsia and Pacific \nregion by micro-\nborrowers \n \n \nGreater financial \naccess for \nunderserved poor \ncustomers \n \n \n \n \n \nExpansion of private \ncapital flows in the \nAsian microfinance \nsector \n\nOutcome \n \nExpanded and \nimproved access to \nfinance for MFIs in \nADB DMCs \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n\n \n \nEmployment and \nproductive output in the \nMSE sectors of target \nDMCs increase by a total \nof 10% over the next 5 \nyears (2011\u20132015)  \n \nNumber of registered \nmicrofinance customers at \nMFIs supported under the \nprogram increases by \n25% from 2011 to 2015  \n \n \n \n \nPrivate investment in the \nmicrofinance sector in \nAsia increases by 20% \nfrom 2011 to 2015 \n\n \n \nMFIs funded under the \nprogram increase their \nbalance sheet funding \nand loan portfolios by \n30% from 2011 to 2015 \n \nPortfolio credit quality \nremains high among MFIs \nsupported under the \nprogram, with average \nNPLs of less than 5% \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n  \nCentral banks\u2019 \nstatistics, market \ndata, and MFI data \ncompiled by \nindustry-specific \norganizations such \nas Microfinance \nInformation \neXchange  \n \n\n \n \nMFI annual reports \nand financial \nstatements \n \n \n \nReports requested \nfrom PFIs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \nIncreased access to \nfinance will lead to more \nMSEs receiving loans and \nexpanding their role in the \neconomy \n \n \nStable or increased \neconomic development in \nAsia  \n \nSupportive regulatory \nenvironment \n \nRisk \n \nThe global financial crisis \nhas a prolonged negative \neffect on broader economic \ngrowth \n\nAssumptions \n \nThere is demand for credit \nservices \n \nMFIs do not breach \nrespective national \nprudential norms \n \nNo regulatory changes for \nthe microfinance sector in \nrelevant countries \n \nNo further adverse regional \nor national economic \ndevelopments  \n \nNo other exogenous factors \nthat have a negative impact \non Asian financial sector \ndevelopment \n \nRisk \nStability of the regional \neconomic and political \nlandscape \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nOutput \n \nRisk participation \nprogram is \nimplemented \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines\n\n \n \n$250 million is made \navailable for Asian \nmicrofinance customers \nup to 2015  \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms\n\n \n \nReports requested \nfrom PFIs \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \nIdentification of a sufficient \nnumber of PFIs to fully \nutilize the program  \n\n1.1 Continue to engage potential PFIs and promote \nutilization of the risk participation program  \n\nADB: $250 million in microfinance credit exposure \nthrough risk participation \n\nActivities with Milestones \n\nInputs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Conduct due diligence on PFIs, including \nreview of microfinance portfolio, business plan, \ncredit underwriting, and monitoring procedures \n\n1.3 Agree on MFI eligibility criteria with PFIs  \n\n1.4 Execute appropriate documentation with PFIs \nunder risk participation agreements \n\n2.1 PFIs will continue to lend in the Asian \nmicrofinance sector and report to ADB at agreed \nregular intervals \n\n2.2 Monitor and manage the underlying risk \nexposure on an ongoing basis  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, MFI = microfinance institution, MSE = micro \nand small enterprise, NPL = nonperforming loan, PFI = partner financial institution. \nSource: ADB.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title:  Proposed Microfinance Risk Participation Program \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nRisk participation \n\n \n\n \n\nPrivate Sector Operations \nDepartment \nCapital Markets and \nFinancial Sectors Division \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nThis  project  is  a  regional  initiative  so  it  does  not  link  to  a  specific  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  developing \nmember country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy or country partnership strategy. However, the initiative is  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s  central  mission  of  poverty  reduction  through  the  implementation  of  various  ADB  strategies  in  relation  to  (i) \npromotion  of  microfinancing  and  increased  access  to  finance,  (ii)  enhancement  of  financial  markets,  and  (iii) \nencouragement  of  appropriate  private  sector-led  initiatives  in  addressing  these  goals.  This  project  would  directly \naddress  all  these  key  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategya\u2014the  promotion  of  (i)  pro-poor,  sustainable \neconomic growth (through financial assistance to microenterprises provided by microfinance institutions [MFIs]); (ii) \nsocial  development  (by  enabling  financial  institutions  via  MFIs  to  reach  out  to  poor,  underserved  areas  of  their \neconomies,  as  well  as  embrace  socially  sound  practices);  and  (iii)  good  governance  (through  working  with  and \nendorsing responsible participating financial institutions (PFIs) that are active in microfinance and lending to MFIs). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \nKey  issues.  Sharing  risk  with  PFIs  will  enable  these  PFIs  to  increase  their  lending  volumes  to  MFIs,  which  will  in \nturn  lead  to  increased  financing  for  the  poor  and  underbanked  populations  in  Asian  developing  markets.  The \nborrowers  are  typically  microenterprises  that  use  the  funds  to  establish  or  expand  small-scale  businesses,  or \nindividuals seeking to satisfy domestic needs. MFIs also provide non-credit services such as savings accounts and \ninsurance  that  offer  equal  or  greater  potential  to  help  build  social  and  economic  security,  by  assisting  low-income \npeople to build assets and protect themselves against unforeseen crises. The microlending modality has been very \nsuccessful in extending finance to previously economically disenfranchised people.   \n\nDesign  features.  This  project  will  support  the  goal  of  poverty  reduction  indirectly  through  stimulating  economic \ngrowth, and directly by helping to improve access to finance for some of Asia\u2019s poorest households. This will create \nemployment  opportunities,  provide  more  investment  in  human  capital,  and  otherwise  benefit  low-income  people \nthrough providing financial access.   \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey issues. This project is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will share \nrisk with PFIs to increase PFI funding provided to MFIs, which will in turn finance individuals and microenterprises. \nThese  microenterprises  will  not  acquire  land  through  expropriation  or  restrict  access  to  land  or  cause  physical  or \neconomic  displacement.  Underlying  MFIs  may  extend  credit  and  non-credit  services  in  localities  with  ethnic \nminorities or indigenous peoples. Through these MFIs, PFIs may benefit individual businesses owned by indigenous \npeoples  or  ethnic  minorities  in  rural  areas  but  will  not  affect  indigenous  peoples  as  a  community  or  their  dignity, \nhuman rights, livelihood systems, or culture. Activities of these microenterprises are unlikely to use ancestral land or \nany  ancestral  domain and  will not involve any large-scale development of products of indigenous knowledge. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  PFIs  have  established  social  and  environmental  management  practices  (including  an  environment \nand  social  management  system)  that  are  compliant  with  ADB  policies,  including  reporting  requirements  and \nadherence to ADB\u2019s exclusion list.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations will be held with all PFIs under the program, as has been done with Standard Chartered Bank (SCB).   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nRequirements regarding project implementation and monitoring will be included in transaction documentation. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n \n\n\f20   \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nKey  issues. The program intends to track data across the MFIs that will be part of it. The Microfinance Information \neXhange (MIX), a growing source for financial and social performance data, and to which a large number of Asian \nMFIs  have  started  to  report  to,  tracks  information  specific  to  women.
