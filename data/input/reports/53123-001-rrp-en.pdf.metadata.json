Funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill  provide  support  for  critically  needed  financial  products  and  services  to  this  underserved \nsegment  in  Indonesia  with  targeted  support  for  women  SME  clients  and  borrowers  in  less-\npenetrated geographical markets, primarily outside Greater Jakarta. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIndonesia\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  grown  by  an  average  of  5.5%  annually \nsince 2010, most recently expanding at 5.1% in 2017 and 5.2% in 2018. The economy is projected \nto  grow  at  5.2%  in  2019  and  5.3%  in  2020.1 In  2018,  increased  volatility  in  emerging  markets \nimpacted Indonesia, with the rupiah depreciating sharply against the US dollar. Bank Indonesia\u2019s \nresponse of tightening monetary policy is credited with restoring stability and moderating inflation \nexpectations from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.4% in 2018 and 3.5% in 2019.2 Despite these challenges, \nIndonesia\u2019s investment-grade credit ratings were reaffirmed or even improved; Moody\u2019s Investor\u2019s \nService upgraded its rating to Baa2 in 2018.3. As Indonesia\u2019s economic growth and credit ratings \nstrengthen,  new  ways  to  accelerate  sustainable and  inclusive  economic growth  are  needed  to \nmeet ambitious economic and social targets, and to address household income inequality.4 \n \n4. \nFinance  sector.  Although  a  large  economy,  Indonesia\u2019s  finance  sector  is  small  and \nunderdeveloped relative to its regional peers.5 Total financial system assets amounted to about \n72%  of  GDP  in  2017.  Banks  dominate  the  sector  with  74%  of  assets;  securities  companies \naccount for 10% of assets; and the mutual funds industry, insurance companies, pension funds, \nand  multifinance  companies  (MFCs)  make  up  the  rest. 6  The  banking  system  is  highly \nconcentrated  with  the top  20  banks  accounting  for  about  80%  of  total  assets.

It has adequate asset quality with a nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio of 3%;8 \nand is profitable, with a return on average assets of 2% and a return on average equity of 20%. \nThe Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK) was established as an integrated regulator \nin 2011 and has overseen the entire finance sector since 2012, including Basel III implementation. \nIn 2016, the Bank for International Settlements rated Indonesia largely compliant with the Basel \nIII framework.9 \n \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprise  sector. Most  enterprises  in Indonesia  are small, \n5. \nusually  employing  fewer  than  20  people.  However,  their  contribution  to  employment  is \nsignificant\u2014about 76%. It is estimated that there are more than 59 million enterprises, of which \njust over 1% are considered SMEs10 and about 98% are considered microenterprises.11 Women \nown  almost  50%  of  SMEs  in  Indonesia. 12  SMEs  contribute  about  22%  to  GDP,  or  57%  if \nmicroenterprises  are  included.  The  government  prioritizes  development  of  the  sector.  It  has \ndevised  a  legal  framework13 involved  several  ministries  in  SME  policy,  (notably  the  Ministry  of \nCooperatives  and  SMEs);  and  has  established  a  significant  number  of  government  programs \nsupporting SMEs.14 \n \n6. \nAccess  to  finance.  The  proportion  of  the  adult  population  having  a  bank  account \nincreased  from  36%  in  2014  to  about  49%  in  2017\u2014the  highest  growth  rate  in  the  region.15 \nHowever, access to credit remains very limited. Based on the 2017 Global Findex Data, only 18% \nof men and 17% of women in Indonesia borrowed from a financial institution, while 40% of men \nand 32% of women borrowed from family or friends and only 6% of borrowers reported that the \nmoney was used to start, operate, and/or expand a farm or business (footnote 15). The geography \nof the country also presents an additional barrier to credit access. In 2016, 69% of all formal loans \nwere extended to borrowers in Java.16 \n \n7. \nLending  to  SMEs  has  not  been  an  area  of  primary focus  for the  banking  sector.  Some \nrural banks have catered to SMEs, although these banks tend to be smaller and their operations \nrestricted by regulation to a designated territory. Only 12% of SMEs in the country have access \nto  formal  credit  (footnote  11),  underscoring  the  limited  depth  of  financial  inclusion.  Women,  in \n\n \n\n7  The four largest banks are the three state-owned banks: PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia Tbk, PT Bank Mandiri Tbk, and \n\nPT Bank Negara Indonesia Tbk, and the privately owned PT Bank Central Asia Tbk ranked third in asset size.  \n\n8  An NPL is a loan that is past due for payment by 90 days. \n9  Bank  for  International  Settlements,  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision.  2016.

Jakarta. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nparticular, experience constraints in accessing funding for their businesses, including difficulties \nin meeting loan eligibility criteria because of lack of property ownership and, in some cases, limited \nbusiness  experience. 17  Furthermore,  few  financial  institutions  offer  products  and  services \ncustomized  to  address  these  constraints.18 Given  that  about  18%  of  banks\u2019  loan  portfolios  are \ndirected at SMEs, and most are for working capital purposes in the wholesale and retail sectors \n(53%), there is significant potential for growth. A World Bank study estimated the SME financing \ngap at more than $165 billion.19 \n \nMultifinance companies. Nonbank financial institutions, especially MFCs, have been the \n8. \nprimary financial institutions catering to SMEs. MFCs are licensed, non-deposit-taking financial \ninstitutions  permitted  to  offer  financial  services  in  leasing,  consumer  financing,  credit  card \nfinancing, and factoring. In 2019, about 185 MFCs operated in Indonesia, the largest of which are \nassociated  with  larger  banks  or  auto  manufacturers.  MFCs  mostly  target  retail  borrowers, \nfinancing  vehicle  purchases  (70%),  followed  by  wholesale  leasing  (27%)  and  factoring  (3%) \n(footnote  19).  MFCs  are  regulated  by  the  OJK  under  a  framework  that  encourages  portfolio \ndiversification,  extending  their  range  of  permissible  activities  to  include  direct  investment  and \nworking capital financing.20 \n \n9. \nRationale.  To  support  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  is \npursuing financial  institutions  in  Indonesia that  have  a  successful track  record  in  servicing  this \nsegment. Most recently, ADB has been supporting microfinance institutions directly and through \nthe Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program.21 The proposed transaction would \nbe the first nonsovereign operations project to partner with an MFC in Indonesia to fund SMEs. \nADB  selected  Indosurya  because  of  its  focused  strategy  of  funding  SMEs  through  targeted \noutreach.  Established  in  2011, Indosurya  now spans  70  branches  along  with  various  alliances \nwith local agents and fintech partners. Indosurya received a national rating of A\u2013 by Fitch Ratings \nin  May  2018  as  a  result  of  its  satisfactory  asset  quality,  strong  profitability,  and  robust \ncapitalization.22 \n\n \n10. \nThe  design  of  the  proposed  transaction  builds  on  lessons  from  previous  ADB \nnonsovereign  operations  supporting  SME  financing  in  other  countries.  It  incorporates  realistic \ndevelopment targets and indicators; for the women SME targets, it includes a gender action plan \n(GAP) to enhance business sustainability. It also provides the option of local currency financing \nto avoid currency induced credit risk of ADB\u2019s borrowers and their SME clients. Finally, a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA), which will be approved separately, will also enhance Indosurya\u2019s asset-\nliability management, ensuring a more robust financing strategy.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n17 DBS Bank Ltd. 2017.

In addition to its large branch network, in \n2017  Indosurya  partnered  with  several  peer-to-peer  (P2P)  platforms  to  increase  the  share  of \nsmaller loans. Indosurya had 991 staff members in April 2019.23 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nIndosurya manages a loan portfolio of about Rp3.6 trillion which represent about 1% of \n12. \nthe estimated MFC market. The portfolio grew at a compound annual rate of 21% from 2014 to \n2018, and the company forecasts continued robust portfolio growth of 18% annually from 2019 to \n2023 by focusing on the untapped SME market. Indosurya also tries to lower its cost of funds to \nbetter compete with commercial banks for repeat business clients on their second loan cycles. \nIndosurya  is  streamlining  its  processing  to  lower  operational  costs  by  making  information \ntechnology  investments  to  (i)  develop  an  online  platform  to  support  end-to-end  customer \napplication  appraisal  to disbursement  and  collections  processing,  (ii)  enhance  its  existing  core \nsystem to improve underwriting processes, and (iii) strengthen its liquidity and longer-term funding \nmanagement. \n \nC. \n \nOwnership. Indosurya is part of a group of companies owned by the Surya family.24 The \n13. \nfounder  of  Indosurya,  Surya  Effendy  is  the  chair  of  its  board  of  commissioners  (BOC).  The \nfounder\u2019s son, Henry Surya is the chief executive officer and chair of the board of directors (BOD). \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  and  identified  no  significant  or  potentially  significant \nintegrity risks.25 All of the ultimate beneficial owners have been identified and they do not appear \nto  be  subjects  of  any  unresolved  or  substantiated  adverse  media  or  other  information.  Two \nmembers of the BOC are politically exposed persons, having served as directors in state-owned \nentities; however, neither is the subject of any adverse news. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not \ngive ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering or the financing of terrorism. \nTax integrity due diligence was not required.26 \n \n14.  Management. In addition to Henry Surya as chief executive officer, the key management \nteam comprises non-family members, each with more than 10 years of experience in banking and \nMFC  operations.  They  include  Mulyadi  Tjung, managing  director;  Junus Octora, chief  financial \nofficer; and Henli Salim, chief operating officer. \n \n15. \nGovernance  structure.  Indosurya\u2019s  governance  structure  is  based  on  the  regulatory \nframework established by the OJK.27 It functions in a two-tier board structure comprising the BOC, \nwhich  is  composed  of  three  commissioners,  including  the  chair,  Surya  Effendy,  and  two \nindependent  commissioners;  and  the  BOD,  which  is  composed  of  five  directors,  including  the \n\n \n\n23 Indosurya also has about 5,000 external agents working on commission basis to originate and service clients. \n24 The  group  companies  include  activities  in  multifinance,  asset  management,  securities,  life  insurance,  business \n\nprocess reengineering banking, microfinancing, cooperatives, and real estate. \n\n25 ADB. 2003.

In the event that the A loan or part of it is denominated in US dollars, \nADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $50 million by mobilizing impact investors and other \neligible B loan participants, subject to market conditions. ADB also expects to provide a TA to \nsupport and enhance Indosurya\u2019s asset and liability management framework.31 \n \nB. \n \nUse of proceeds.

ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  carry  out \nproject monitoring. Indosurya will prepare and submit to ADB financial and monitoring reports at \npredetermined  regular  intervals  and  as  requested,  including  (i)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements; (ii) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for \nloan  covenants;  (iv)  semiannual  reporting  on  the  loan  portfolio;  and  (v)  annual  reporting  on \n\n \n\n28 BKR International is an international association of independent audit firms. BKR International was sixth in the 2017 \n\nInternational Accounting Bulletin rankings for global associations. \n\n29 IFC has provided technical assistance (TA) to Indosurya to upgrade its risk management framework, with a particular \n\nfocus on credit scoring. \n\n30 The  Credit  Committee comprises  the  head  of  credit;  the  risk,  appraisal,  and legal  teams;  and the  BOD,  which  is \n\nultimately responsible for overall risk management. The committee meets at least twice a week. \n\n31 The TA will be processed separately. \n32 Women  SME  clients  are  defined  as  entities  with  at  least  one  of  these  characteristics  (i)  at  least  60%  of  senior \nmanagers are women, (ii) women control at least 50% of the ownership, and/or (iii) at least 50% of the registered \nemployees are women. \n\n33 Greater  Jakarta  refers  to  the  area  encompassing  Jakarta  as  well  as  the  neighboring  cities  of  Bogor,  Depok, \n\nTangerang, and Bekasi, commonly referred to as Jabodetabek. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\ndevelopment effectiveness and environment and social performance, including the development \nindicators specified in the GAP agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nSupport small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 growth. ADB\u2019s funding will support the \ngrowth of Indosurya\u2019s SME loan portfolio, including its women SME financing portfolio. Some of \nthe funding will also target geographic areas where access to finance is more limited, such as \noutside Greater Jakarta. Gender support initiatives will be implemented through the GAP. \n \n21. \nProvide longer tenor debt. Indosurya has relied on local commercial banks for funding, \nmostly at shorter tenors, and capital market issuances of medium-term notes. To finance its longer \ntenor SME portfolio, Indosurya has sought matching financing, which is challenging for smaller \nMFCs in Indonesia. In addition to longer-term financing, ADB\u2019s TA will help Indosurya strengthen \nits liquidity and longer-term funding management. \n \nCatalyze private sector financing.

ADB conducted due diligence to assess \nthe potential environmental and social impacts and risks associated with Indosurya's existing and \nfuture  portfolio,  and  its  capacity  to  implement  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS). The multipurpose loans are only used for consumer or personal \nuse (e.g., vehicle loans) are considered to have no environmental or social impacts. Most of the \nloan portfolio consists of investment loans and working capital loans. These are used for various \nbusiness  sectors  including  trading,  hotel,  and  restaurant;  business  services;  construction; \nindustrial; and freight, warehousing, and communications. Since the project involves the financing \nof  SMEs  with  ADB  proceeds,  it  will  have  very  limited  direct  climate  change  impact.  Sample \nsubprojects  in  the  hotel,  construction,  and  industry  sectors  were  visited  as  part  of  the  due \ndiligence. The subloans for these subcompanies were provided at a time when Indosurya had no \nformal environmental and social management procedures. The subcompanies comply with the \nregulatory environmental requirements in Indonesia. Indosurya will screen its future subprojects \nfor  all  potential  environmental,  health  and  safety,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples impacts and risks; and will require subborrowers to implement mitigation measures or \nprepare corrective action plans, as appropriate. \n \n29. \nIndosurya  is  finalizing  its  ESMS,  which  it  initiated  when  the  German  Investment \nCorporation  (DEG)  provided  its  loan  to  Indosurya  in  2017.  ESMS  implementation  is  the \nresponsibility  of  Indosurya\u2019s  Risk  Management  and  Information  System  Department  and  the \ndirector of risk and information technology is concurrently assigned as the ESMS officer. As part \nof its organizational strengthening, Indosurya has committed to hire additional ESMS staff and \nengage a senior environmental and social consultant with the requisite background as it expands \nits business and geographic coverage. DEG, through its ESMS consultant, provided training on \nthe ESMS to Indosurya to strengthen the capacity of relevant staff to undertake environmental \nand social safeguards screening, categorization, and monitoring. Before disbursement of ADB\u2019s \nfinancing,  the  company  will  enhance  the  draft  ESMS  to  harmonize  the  ESMS  requirements  of \nDEG  and  IFC  with  those  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.40 The  ESMS  will  ensure  that \nIndosurya will not use ADB funding to finance projects classified category A for environmental \n\n \n\nSustainable Growth Path.
