THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth  in the \nNortheastern Provinces Sector Project. \n \n2.  The four northeastern provinces of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, and Lang Son with an \narea of 27,801 square kilometers include some of the remotest communities in Viet Nam. In 2015, \nthe provinces had a total population of 2.36 million consisting largely of ethnic minorities with high \npoverty levels. Under the proposed provincially managed multisector project, locally prioritized \nbasic infrastructure subprojects will be implemented. The subprojects will support economic \nconnectivity among the provinces and improve the rural living standards of over 212,000 people \nthrough better (i) interprovincial commerce and rural accessibility by upgrading provincial and \ndistrict roads, (ii) health through the construction of rural domestic water supply (RDWS) systems, \n(iii) incomes and livelihoods through strengthened agriculture and rural value chains (ARVCs), \nand (iv) sustainability of provincially owned infrastructure through the establishment of asset \nmanagement systems.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The overriding comparative advantage of the four provinces is the northeast geographic \nlocation, particularly with Cao Bang, Ha Giang, and Lang Son having extensive borders with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The provinces are at the nexus of the PRC, with its vast market \nand high demand for Vietnamese products; the Red River Delta, with Hanoi and its strong \ndomestic market; and with the Hai Phong port link to world markets. The area is adjacent to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Greater Mekong Subregion North\u2013South Economic \nCorridor, including both the central and eastern subcorridors.2 In 2015, total PRC\u2013Viet Nam trade \nwas $96 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014, imports from the PRC to Viet Nam grew at 4%, \nwhile exports to the PRC grew at 49%.3 Viet Nam continues to expand trade with PRC by \ndeveloping additional international gateways and auxiliary border crossings.4  \n \n4.  The full economic potential of the four northeastern provinces is not yet realized. Viet \nNam\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average rate of 6% per year during 2012\u20132016, with \ngross domestic product per capita reaching $2,108, however in the project area it remains about \nhalf the national average, at $1,160. The 2015 nationwide poverty level was 7.0% but the levels \nwere 17.1% in Bac Kan, 24.4% in Cao Bang, 24.2% in Ha Giang and 16.2% in Lang Son.5 Most \nrural communities in the provinces are weakly integrated into the mainstream economy and social \nservices. They remain highly vulnerable to changing circumstances through external shocks such \nas commodity price fluctuations and extreme climatic events, amplified by climate change trends. \n  \n5.  The underlying causes of low income and poverty in the northeastern provinces include:  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n2  The two subcorridor sections are (i) Kunming (PRC) to Hanoi or Hai Phong, and (ii) Nanning (PRC) to Hanoi. \n3  Viet Nam to Become China\u2019s Biggest ASEAN Trader in 2016. http://m.english.vietnam.net/fms/business/152210. \n4  Government of Viet Nam and Government of People\u2019s Republic of China. 2011.

Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam. Hanoi. ", "2 \n(i)  Poor  road  connectivity.  The  mountainous  terrain  makes  road  development \nexpensive. The road density averages 70% of the national average, with only 32% \nof provincial roads and 26% of district roads in good condition. The provinces are \npoorly linked to each other and to many rural communities; local enterprises are \nless competitive due to high input and output costs; and travel on the roads is long, \narduous, and dangerous. The national arterial road network\u2019s south\u2013north axis is \nmostly established, but much work remains to be done on the east\u2013west axis.  \n(ii)  Limited clean water supply. Only 16% of rural households have access to clean \nwater,  in  contrast  to  the  national  average  of  45%.  The  generally  steep, \nmountainous terrain complicates water storage and distribution management.  \n(iii)  Limited value addition to agriculture and rural production. The provinces \nalready produce and could greatly expand the production of many high-value crops \nsuch  as  oranges  and  star  anise,  but  inadequate  basic  infrastructure,  weak \nproduction  organization,  and  limited  access  to  finance,  hampers  local  value \naddition from farm to consumer, constraining profits and private investment. \n(iv)  Weak  infrastructure  asset  management.  The  piecemeal  development  of \nprovincial infrastructure assets, without proper management systems, has resulted \nin substandard public infrastructure condition, coverage and sustainability.  \n \n6.  The project will help unlock the development binding constraints by improving basic \ninfrastructure across key sectors following with the Overall Development Plan of Mountainous \nNortheastern Provinces 2015.6 Stronger provincial integration into the national economy will be \nachieved by: (i) upgrading the road network to interconnect: provincial centers; the PRC border \ngates; the east\u2013west network with the main road corridors to Hanoi and ports on the east coast; \nand remote rural communities; 7 (ii) developing clean, dependable RDWSs to improve health and \nto support enterprise; (iii) increasing ARVC profitability by using modern technologies, building up \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and improving farmer capacity through (a) the use \nof funds awarded through competitive processes for SME development, (b) increased use of trade \npromotion, (c) developing producer\u2013market links, and (d) establishing larger commercial-scale \nproduction units; and (iv) effective provincial asset management to improve the performance, \nreturns, and sustainability of infrastructure investment. \n \n7.  The project is aligned with important government policies and strategies as expressed in \n(i) the 2016 Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u20132020, which aims to expand and promote \nexports  and  sustain  trading  surpluses; 8  (ii)  the  2013  Master  Plan  for  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment of Northern Midland and Mountainous Areas towards 2020, which stresses the \nbenefits,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  services  to  rural  communities  by  increasing \nmultisector public and private investments;9 (iii) the 2009 government transport strategy, which \nemphasizes corridor development and inclusive rural connectivity;10 (iv) the 2011 National Target \nProgram on New Rural Development with targets for rural access, RDWSs, and ARVCs;11 (v) \n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2015.Overall Development Plan of Mountainous Northeastern Provinces of Viet Nam to \n2020.

The project supports the three pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nfor Viet Nam:13 (i) job creation and competitiveness, through improving physical connectivity, \nsupporting commerce and employment creation, enhancing the business environment, and \nincreasing productivity; (ii) inclusive basic infrastructure and service delivery, through diversifying \neconomic opportunities, broadening access to social services, creating livelihood opportunities \nfor remote northeastern rural people, who have disproportionately high numbers of poor and \npredominantly belong to ethnic minorities, and working with provincial governments to improve \nthe management of provincially owned infrastructure assets; and (iii) improved environmental \nsustainability and climate change response, with climate-proofing measures in investments. \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s experience is central in guiding the decisions \nto  support  decentralized  government  in  defining  inclusive  development  through  feasible \nmultisector investments with the key features of: (i) provincial responsibility for project execution \nand financing - by borrowing onlent ADB loan proceeds. ADB inputs reduce risks in provincial \ngovernance,  financial  management  and  sustainability;  and  (ii)  locally  integrated  multisector \ninvestments support inclusive local development needs and economic opportunities. ADB has \ndrawn upon specialists across its operations to ensure project viability and due diligence. Greater \nsynergies will be achieved with ADB technical assistance by integrating their activities directly into \nthe project, such as agriculture competitiveness, decentralized public asset management and \nroad safety.14 The project will coordinate with the International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD) on ARVCs.15 ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission backed-up by ADB\u2019s technical divisions, \nhas experience and capacity to assist the government to overcome implementation challenges \nhaving recently administered in the project area projects such as Sustainable Rural Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project in Northern Mountain Provinces and Transport Connections in the Northern \nMountainous Provinces Project.16 \n \n10.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience. The project draws on lessons learned from ADB \noperations, including the need to improve: (i) basic infrastructure and connectivity for economic \ngrowth, business competitiveness and integration of rapidly developing areas with disadvantaged \nregions; (ii) provincial government ownership through early engagement in project design and \nmanagement; (iii) sustainability by including operation and maintenance (O&M) and climate \nchange considerations into investment strategies; (iv) promoting a more inclusive growth path by \nenhancing ADB support for SMEs through direct capital financing; and (v) project readiness \nthrough the preparation of additional feasibility studies, master bidding documents, and consultant \nsupport during the start-up phase to prevent delays and increase implementation efficiency.   \n                                                \n12 Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

Manila. \n \n ", "4 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: subregional competitiveness of the four \nnortheastern provinces enhanced (footnote 6). The project will have the following outcome: \nproduction, service delivery, and movement of goods and passengers sustainably increased.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Road network connectivity improved. The output will upgrade about 121 \nkilometers of provincial and 144 kilometers of district roads, which will improve overall network \nefficiency by integrating interprovincial travel, transport, and commerce, as well as improve \nconnectivity with PRC border crossings. Many isolated, poor rural communities will be able to \naccess the transport network at lower cost, leading to both economic and social benefits. Reduced \ntransport costs and improved rural access will make SMEs more competitive, and enhance rural \ndevelopment initiatives. The improved network connectivity addresses significant barriers to the \ndevelopment of tourism circuits. Road safety will be included in subproject design, with about 44 \ntraffic calming measures forcing reductions in vehicular speeds at critical points, such as schools, \nand 13 safety awareness trainings carried out for vulnerable road users. Output 1 will benefit \napproximately 44 rural communities, comprising about 160,000 people in 27,411 households. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Rural  water  supply  improved.  About  ten  RDWS  subprojects  will  be \nconstructed to meet the 2030 forecasted demand. Clean water will (i) improve public health, \nwhich is particularly important for communities located far from medical facilities; (ii) help develop \nARVCs, as clean water is needed to wash produce, and for creating sanitary conditions at an \nearly stage of value addition at farm and throughout the ARVC; and (iii) increase the tourism \ndemand through more attractive facilities. Output 2 will serve about 22 communes, comprising \n42,300 people in 10,000 households. \n \n14.  Output 3: Agriculture and rural value chain infrastructure in Lang Son province \nimproved. The viability and incomes of local rural producers and SMEs will be increased by \nsupplying  high-quality  food,  spices,  and  flowers  to  (i)  international  markets,  (ii)  northern \nVietnamese urban centers, and (iii) local tourist sites. IFAD will continue its established program \nof ARVC support in the Bac Kan, Cao Bang and Ha Giang. While in Lang Son, the project will \nreplicate proven IFAD models to support horticultural trade and marketing organizations for at \nleast five commodities. It will introduce market-based business plans, provide viability gap grants \nto at least 30 existing value chain enterprises to leverage investment into value-adding technology \nand infrastructure, support 80 producer groups for investing in market-linked quality control, \nproduction, and post-harvest infrastructure. Better transport (output 1) and clean water (output 2) \nwill lead to competitive ARVCs in all four provinces. Output 3 will directly benefit about three \ncommunes comprising about 10,400 people in 3,000 households. \n \n15.  Output 4: Decentralized public asset management processes established. ADB is \nsupporting the national decentralized public asset management program.18 The provinces will \nprocure asset management hardware and systems, and carry out associated staff training. The \nsystems will include indicators and tools to allow monitoring of annual maintenance budgets and \n                                                \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 ADB. 2016.

Each Provincial People\u2019s Committees (PPC) will be an executing agency and shall chair \ntheir respective provincial steering committees to address project coordination, negotiations, and \ndiscussions.23 Each Provincial Department of Planning and Investment will be an implementing \nagency and will establish project management units (PMU) for day to day operations. The PMUs \nwill be legally registered entities able to sign contracts with consultants, contractors, and suppliers, \nand will be assisted by the loan implementation consultants. The Lang Son PMU will establish a \nsmall unit for aggregating reports for, and to coordinate with, ADB. At the commune level, the \nPMUs will coordinate with local administrations, and liaise with commune people's committees.   \n \n24.  Project readiness will be enhanced by the: (i) preparation of 11 subproject feasibility \nstudies, a screened and prioritized list of 17 potential additional subprojects and master bidding \ndocuments;24 (ii) contract signing for detailed design and loan implementation consultant upon \nloan effectiveness;25 and (iii) intensive training to the PMUs for key operational tasks.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Viet Nam\u2019s private sector has the skills for subproject implementation. Of the 11 subproject \nfeasibility studies prepared following the relevant Viet Nam design standards, nine were used as \nrepresentative subprojects.26 Detailed demand forecasts and preliminary engineering designs \ninformed the road and RDWS subproject feasibility studies. For the ARVC subprojects, market \ndemand  was  confirmed,  value  addition  constraints  were  identified,  indicative  investment \npackages  specified  and  quality  control  standards  and  procedures  were  defined.  Technical \nguidelines were prepared for integrating climate change risk into detailed designs for more \nresilient infrastructure through increased flood elevations, improved cross drainage, and the use \nof bioengineering for erosion protection. For ARVC\u2019s the movement into safe food systems and \nstandards, drip and spray irrigation with organic fertilizer and backward linked supply contracting \nwill enable producers to adapt to climate and market risks.27 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n 26.  The economic and financial analysis was carried out following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects,  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.28 Financial \nanalysis  of  the  feasibility  studies  validate  the  financial  and  fiscal  sustainability  of  all  nine \nrepresentative subprojects.29 O&M was estimated for the economic life of each road subproject \nand  is  less  than 1%  of  current  provincial  O&M  budgets.30 The  RDWS  subprojects  will  be \nprofessionally managed by water supply companies  without incremental increases in fiscal \nresources and do not require a subsidy increase. The financial internal rates of return for RDWS \nsubprojects range from 2% to 3%, all above the weighted cost of capital. The ARVCs are fiscally \npositive  requiring  no  operational  subsidy  while  generating  increased  tax  revenues  through \nenterprise growth. The financial internal rate of return is 14% for the safe vegetable and 25% for \n                                                \n23 Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Additional Subprojects Screening Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Using loan proceeds from ADB. 2012.

The provinces are heavily dependent on transfers from \nthe central government and the establishment of the asset management systems will improve the \nsustainability of provincial infrastructure assets, and the loan agreement includes a covenant \ncommitting the government to provide adequate O&M for subproject investments. \n \n27.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the road representative subprojects, are \nabove 10%, based on vehicle operating cost and time savings. For RDWS subprojects, the EIRRs \nare above 9% based on the willingness to pay by domestic, industrial, and institutional users, and \nthe time savings and health benefits for households. All subproject EIRRs exceed the social \ndiscount rate of 9%, which is taken as the threshold rate. The EIRRs are estimated to be 25% for \nthe safe vegetable value chain and 15% for the star anise subprojects. Sensitivity analysis \nconsiders: (i) cost overruns on investment and O&M; (ii) reductions in forecasted demand for \nproduce or services; and (iii) reduction in project benefits such as vehicle operating and time cost \nsavings, health benefits, and agricultural produce prices. Economic viability is robust against risks. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The  financial  management  assessment  identified  a  high  risk  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies because of capacity and systems constraints in existing accounting, \nstaffing, auditing, and controls systems.31 Mitigation measures have been captured in the financial \nmanagement  action  plan,  to  implement  training,  accounting  systems,  and  external  audit \narrangements, and are supported by a covenant in the loan agreement. All procurement of goods \nand civil works and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and have been arranged considering the \nlimited capacity for managing externally funded projects in the four northeastern provinces. The \ngovernment\u2019s public procurement regulations, as acceptable to ADB, will be applied for packages \nprocured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, and discussed \nwith,  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The four northeastern provinces have high rural populations (80%), of whom 88% belong \nto ethnic minorities, and have rural poverty rates ranging from 28% to 57%, being roughly equal \nfor men and women.32 The rural people often have limited access to markets, with low labor \nproductivity associated with smallholder farming. Paid employment accounts for limited lengths of \ntime, ranging from 25% in Bac Kan to 41% in Lang Son. Rural migration to urban areas is \naccelerating, leaving an aging population and constraining future rural economic growth potential. \n \n31.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis \nrevealed that women are disadvantaged in participating in public decision making, access to \ninformation, training, and employment, while often carrying a disproportionate work load.33 The \nproject gender action plan will promote (i) equal access to project benefits and opportunity \nsharing; (ii) reduction in gender inequalities and social risks; (iii) increased representation of \n                                                \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nwomen in decision making, (iv) collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and \nevaluation;  and  (v)  the  role  of  women  in  ARVCs,  which  often  exceeds  50%  and  requires \nproportionately inclusive measures. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with national requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nall PPCs and ADB have agreed on the project\u2019s safeguard categories and mitigating measures. \nADB\u2019s safeguard due diligence, gender action plan, appropriate community consultations and \nimplementation resources, are included in all representative subproject feasibility studies, which \nserve  are  as  models  for  succeeding  subproject  feasibility  studies.  ADB  will  only  finance \nsubprojects that are classified category B or category C for all safeguards concerns. \n \n33.  Environment  (category  B).  PPCs  and  ADB  have  agreed  upon  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework.34 The road works are limited to upgrades within the existing \nor newly established right-of-way and environmental impacts will be minor and temporary. They \nwill not infringe on protected or environmentally sensitive areas and will require only simple \nmitigation measures such as proper management of construction camps or storage of building \nmaterials.  Each  initial  environmental  examination  prepared  for  the  nine  representative \nsubprojects includes an environmental management plan with appropriate mitigation measures \nand have been publicly disclosed.35 \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). PPCs and ADB have agreed on a combined \nresettlement and ethnic minorities development framework.36 Resettlement and ethnic minority \ndevelopment plans were prepared for all representative subprojects. They are supported by public \nconsultation and information disclosure, which will be continued during implementation. The only \nimpacts will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, crops, or small \nstructures  within  the  rights-of-way,  for  which  compensation,  allowances,  operation  and \nadministration, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from government counterpart \nfunds. The internal monitor will ensure that any impacts are evaluated properly and reported to \nADB semiannually through the PPCs. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \nminorities in Viet Nam, are overwhelmingly positive and will enhance economic and social \nimprovement. The project will neither cause displacement from traditional or customary lands nor \nnegatively impact the identity, culture, or customary livelihood systems. The resettlement and \nethnic minorities development framework will ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities within \nproject benefits and provide the basis to prepare subproject resettlement and ethnic minority \ndevelopment plans with impact mitigation measures, capacity development, a grievance redress \nmechanism, and compliance with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n36.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n                                                \n34 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Initial Environmental Examinations for Representative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) \n36 Resettlement Framework: Resettlement and Ethnic Minorities Development Framework (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n Table 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPremature asset deterioration.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The Government of Viet Nam and the PPCs of the four northeastern provinces of Bac Kan, \nCao Bang, Ha Giang, and Lang Son have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the PPCs of the four northeastern \nprovinces have agreed with ADB on certain covenants, which are set forth in the loan and project \nagreements, including that no withdrawal shall be made from the loan account until the onlending \nloan agreements between the government and the PPCs have been duly completed. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive \nGrowth in the Northeastern Provinces Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period and \nthereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n24 November 2017\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nSubregional competitiveness of the four northeastern provinces enhanced.(Overall Development Plan of \nMountainous Northeastern Provinces of Viet Nam to 2020, and National Target Program on new rural \ndevelopment for 2016-2020)a \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2024:     \nProduction,  a. average annual increase of 5% in  a.\u2013b.
