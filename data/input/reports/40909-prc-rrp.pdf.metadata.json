The  banking  sector \ndominates  the  financial  system  in  the  PRC.  However,  the \ninefficiency of the sector has been identified as one of the greatest \nobstacles  to  long-term  growth,  especially  the  limited  access  of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to financing.  \n \nRecognizing  the  need  to  improve  the  banking  sector,  the \nGovernment of the PRC has encouraged the reform of its banks, \nespecially  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCB).  For  certain \nqualified banks, the Government has promoted the involvement of \nprivate domestic and foreign strategic investors. The first stage of \nreforms targeted the \u201cbig four\u201d SOCBs. Now the focus of reforms \nis on the network of 112 city commercial banks (CCB) that serve \nmajor  urban  areas  throughout  the  PRC.  These  CCBs  play\u2014and \nwill  continue  to  play\u2014a  vital  role  in  and  around  the  cities  they \nserve, especially in SME development. However, CCBs will have \nto  address  some  significant  issues  before  they  can  improve, \nincluding  strategic  risk,  poor  corporate  governance,  weak  risk \nmanagement, and low capital adequacy ratios.  \n \nThe  success  of  PRC\u2019s  banking  reforms,  SME  development,  and \neconomic  growth  hinges  on  the  ability  of  PRC  banks,  especially \nthe CCBs, to address these challenges properly. The Government \nviews  the  introduction  of  experienced  and  qualified  overseas \nstrategic investors as an effective method to promote, as well as \n\n\f \nValue-Added \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nto  enhance,  this  reform  process.  However,  while  the  growth \nprospects  of  PRC\u2019s  banking  sector  are  attractive  to  investors, \ninternational banks remain wary of taking minority stakes even in \nrelatively  higher-quality  CCBs.  Their  main  concerns  are  (i)  the \nthe  strategic  partner\u2019s \nframework;  (ii) \nuntested  governance \npotential  inability  as  minority  investor  to  influence  strategic \ndirection,  management,  and  equity  distributions;  and \n(iii) \nuncertainty over the continued role of local government. \n \nThrough  this  investment,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ndelivers  value  to  HZCCB  by  assisting  in  the  development  of \nadequate  corporate  governance  and  internal  control  procedures, \nas well as in opportunities for commercial cooperation. ADB also \nadds  value  to  HZCCB\u2019s  shareholders  by  fulfilling  the  role  of  an \n\u201chonest broker\u201d that has only the bank\u2019s best interests at heart. \n \nAn  investment  in  HZCCB  would  impact  development  by  (i) \npromoting  the  development  of  a  lagging  financial  sector,  thereby \nincreasing access to finance for SMEs, in a showcase region with \nstrong  private  sector,  SME-driven  economic  development;  (ii) \nsupporting  the  transformation  of  a  leading  CCB,  especially  in \ncorporate  governance, \ninternal  control,  and  environmental \nsensibility,  which  would  send  a  strong  demonstration  signal  to \nother  CCBs  in  the  country;  (iii)  demonstrating  feasibility  and \nproviding  market  benchmarks  for  similar  investments  in  other \nCCBs,  and  helping  to  catalyze  such  investments;  (iv)  indirectly \nfostering  economic  development  of  non-coastal  regions  in  the \nPRC;  and  (iv)  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  restructure \nthe banking sector. \n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nequity investment of up to $30 million in CNY equivalent (or, if ADB is unable to fund in CNY, in \nUS  dollars)  for  approximately  5%  of  the  shares  in  Hangzhou  City  Commercial  Bank,  Co.  Ltd \n(HZCCB), in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (the Project). \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nPRC Economic Development and Industry Background  \n\n1. \n\nOverview of Latest Developments in the PRC Economy \n\nIn recent years, the PRC has made progress in restructuring its economy, especially by \n2. \nreducing its dependence on Government spending and increasing the performance of its state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) sector. On the surface, the PRC possesses a respectable credit profile \n(Standard & Poors: A-, Moody\u2019s: A2, Fitch: A-). The economy features rapid growth rates, high \nsavings and investment rates, low Government and external debt, and stable long-term capital \ninflows.  Driven  by  buoyant  domestic  investment  and  exports,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth has exceeded 9% for 4 straight years, including 9.9% in 2005. The PRC\u2019s key strength, \nhowever, lies in its strong external balance. The current account surplus is about three times the \ncountries external debt, while reserves cover its external debt three times and short-term debt \nfive  times.  The  economic  expansion  continued  in  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  as  real  GDP  grew \n10.2%  compared  with  the  same  period  in  2005\u2014much  faster  than  the  Government\u2019s  full-year \nprojection of 8% growth. Investment and exports continued to propel growth in the first quarter. \nExports  increased  26.6%  year-on-year,  helping  to  boost  official  foreign  exchange  reserves  to \n$875  billion at  the  end of  March  from  $819  billion  3  months  earlier.  Yet  economic reforms,  as \nwell as social and environmental issues, will continue to present challenges for the foreseeable \nfuture. An economic summary of the PRC is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the PRC: Driving Growth \n\n \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SME)1 play a significant role in the PRC economy, \n3. \ndriving employment, economic growth, and development. They account for almost half of GDP, \ntwo  thirds  of  industrial  value  added,  60%  of  exports,  and  40%  of  fiscal  revenues.2 SMEs  also \nprovide 75% of urban and rural employment. Private sector SMEs have grown faster than the \nlarger  SOEs.  In  recent  years,  the  industrial  output  of  SMEs  has  been  increasing  at an  annual \naverage  rate  of  30%,  compared  with  20%  for  industry  as  a  whole. 3  Consequently,  the \ndevelopment of the SME sector is regarded as more than an important engine of growth. It is \nconsidered a key contributor to poverty reduction by generating jobs, individual income, and tax \nrevenues. \n \n4. \nSMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, a \nsurvey  by  the  State  Information  Center  found  that  more  than  80%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  SMEs  have \ndifficulty accessing financial services and securing financing.4 Although bank loans in the PRC \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Government  of  the  PRC  defines  medium-sized  industrial  enterprises  as  those  with  a  maximum  of  2,000 \nemployees, CNY400 million  in assets, and CNY300 million in sales. Small industrial enterprises are  those  with  a \nmaximum of 300 employees, CNY40 million in assets, and CNY30 million in sales. \n2   ADB. 2003.

This  lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is  considered  the  main  financing  difficulty  and \nstumbling block to sustainable future growth of SMEs. (Appendix 1) \n \n\n3. \n\nOverview of the PRC Financial System  \n\n5. \nThe  banking  sector  plays  a  dominant  role  in  the  PRC\u2019s  financial system.  At  the  end  of \nSeptember  2005,  the  PRC\u2019s  commercial  banking  system  comprised  (i)  four  national  state-\nowned commercial banks (SOCB), (ii) 13 national joint-stock commercial banks (JSCB), (iii) 112 \ncity  commercial  banks  (CCB),  (iv)  57  rural  cooperative  and  commercial  banks,  (v)  626  urban \ncredit cooperatives, (vi) about 30,000 rural credit cooperatives, and (vii) 238 operational entities \nof foreign banks.5 The four SOCBs dominate the sector, together accounting for 54% of banking \nsector assets, followed by the JSCBs (15%), and the CCBs (5%) (Table 1; Appendix 2, Figure \nA2.1). Foreign banks account for less than 2% of market share. \n \n\nTable 1: PRC Banking Sector Statistics, End of March 2006 \n\n% of \ntotal \n53.1\n15.6\n5.4\n25.9\n100\n\nEquity \n(CNY \nbillion) \n936 \n229 \n84 \n494 \n1,743 \n\n% of \ntotal \n     53.7  \n     13.1  \n       4.8  \n     28.3  \n   100  \n\nYear-on-\nyear \ngrowth \n(%) \n\nLiabilities \n(CNY \nbillion) \n\nYear-on-\nyear \ngrowth \n(%) \n\nYear-\non-year \ngrowth \n(%) \n\nItem \nSOCBs \nJSCBs \nCCBs \nOther \n\nAssets \n(CNY \nbillion) \n20,805 \n6,075 \n2,089 \n10,224 \n39,193 \n\n% of \ntotal \n53.1 \n15.5 \n5.3 \n26.1 \n100 \n\nTOTAL \n\n16.8\n26.7\n24.7\n16.6\n18.6\n\n17.4\n26.9\n25.3\n17.5\n19.2\n\n19,869\n5,846\n2,005\n9,730\n37,450\n\n30.5\n33.9\n42.4\n36.8\n33.3\nCCB = city commercial banks, CNY = yuan, JSCB = joint-stock commercial banks, SOCB = State-owned commercial \nbanks. \nSources: China Banking Regulatory Commission, Asian Development Bank staff analysis. \n \n6. \nIn  the  PRC,  the  ratio  of  bank  assets  to  stock  market  capitalization  plus  bonds \noutstanding  exceeds  300%,  a  far  higher  ratio  than  in  most  industrialized  countries  and  even \nmany  developing  countries.  For  example,  India,  Japan,  Mexico,  South  Africa,  and  the  United \nStates  have  ratios  less  than  100%.  The  high  relative  importance  of  the  banking  sector  is \ncommon in many developing economies. In the PRC, however, it is particularly important due to \nthe  large  market  size  and  fast  growth.  The  PRC\u2019s  financial  institution  assets  have  grown  at  a \ncompounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% since 2000, reaching $4.9 trillion at the end of \nMarch  2006\u2014about  the  same  as  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  financial  sector  (Appendix  2,  Figure \nA2.2). \n \n7. \nThe banking sector is at the center of the Government\u2019s economic reforms. Measures to \nclean up the banks have improved asset quality and capitalization, and in many instances risk \nmanagement.  However,  uncertainties  over  the  quality  of  banks\u2019  assets  remain.  In  addition, \nlimited  foreign  participation  in  the  sector  and  cultural  resistance  to  foreign  influence  might \nconstrain the pace of reforms. The recapitalization costs for the banking system are a moving \ntarget,  and  one  of  the  major  risk  factors  constraining  the  PRC\u2019s  credit  profile  and  future \n\n                                                 \n5  China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2005. Latest Developments in China\u2019s Banking Reform, Opening-up and \n\nSupervision. Beijing. 5 December. \n\n\feconomic  development.6   Please  refer  to  Appendix  3  for  an  overview  of  the  PRC\u2019s  financial \nsector. \n \nB. \n\nCity Commercial Banks in the PRC Banking Sector \n\n1. \n\nOverview  \n\n8. \nThe  CCBs  were  formed  through  Government-directed  amalgamations  of  urban  credit \ncooperatives  (UCC)  in  the  mid  to  late  1990s.  This  amalgamation  was  partly  a  response  to \ngalloping  NPLs  created  by  the  unsustainable  UCCs,  and  partly  an  effort  to  consolidate  the \nfinancial  sector  to  achieve  economies  of  scale.  During  this  process,  however,  the  CCBs \nreceived  full  financial  and  managerial  support  by  their  respective  city  governments.  Moreover, \nonly  one  CCB  was  created  in  each  city  (i.e.,  no  competition  for  Government  favors).  Thus, \nCCBs  remained  a  de  facto  part  of  the  city  governments\u2019  economic  planning  apparatus.  This \nincluded significant directed lending to government priority projects and SOEs.  \n \nTypically,  CCBs  still  maintain  very  strong  ties  to  their  respective  city  governments.  In \n9. \nmany  cities,  the  respective  governments  still  hold  majority  equity  stakes.  Some  progressive \nCCBs have  diversified shareholdings, which include local private and state-owned companies, \nas  well  as  upgraded  employees  with  increasing  commercial  skills.  However,  few  CCBs  have \nsubstantial private investment, and none is listed on any stock exchange.  \n \n10. \nAlthough  CCBs  play  an  important  role  in  their  respective  local  banking  sectors,  their \ncontribution  to  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  sector  is  still  relatively  small.  Together,  the  112  CCBs \naccount  for  slightly  more  than  5%  of  the  PRC  banking  sector\u2019s  assets.  Although  small  by \ncomparison to other banks in the PRC, CCBs serve cities that can be very large\u2014as large as \nsmall countries in some cases. For example, Bank of Beijing, Bank of Shanghai, and Chongqing \nCity  Commercial  Bank all  operate  in  markets  with  populations  of  more  than  10  million.  Tianjin \nhas a population of 7.6 million, while Hangzhou has 3.9 million people.  \n \n11. \nAt  the  end  of  March  2006,  CCB  assets  totaled  CNY2.1  trillion,  while  CCB  equity  was \nCNY83.2 billion, according to CBRC. The average CCB NPL ratio was 7.6% at the end of March \n2006, compared with an average of 8.0% for the entire banking sector. In many cities, however, \nthe NPL ratio is still above 20%. As of March 2006, the weighted average capital adequacy ratio \nfor  the  CCB  subsector  had  increased  significantly  to  more  than  5%,  but  remained  below  the \nrequired 8%. \n \n\n2. \n\nIssues Facing CCBs and Policy Reform Initiatives \n\n12. \nThe CCBs have the potential to continue growing at a healthy rate in line with the PRC\u2019s \neconomy  and  banking  sector.  One  forecaster  anticipates  CCBs  will  grow  at  a  CAGR  of  26%, \nreaching nearly $656 billion in assets by 2009.7  \n \n13. \nHowever,  most  CCBs  will  have  difficulty  sustaining  growth  rates  without  jeopardizing \nasset  quality  and  capital  adequacy.  To  provide  competitive,  customer-driven  services  and \nproducts targeted at underserved segments of the markets in cities and regions of the PRC, the \nCCBs will have to develop their capabilities quickly to match those of a modern banking sector. \n\n                                                 \n6  The PRC\u2019s public sector debt to GDP ratio of 43% would double by adding in contingent liabilities associated with \n\nthe banking sector. Addressing this issue, therefore, might ultimately result in additional public expenditures.  \n\n7   CCID Consulting. 2005. 2004-05 China City Commercial Banks Research. Beijing. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this process, the CCBs will have to address some key issues, including (i) limited access to \nstate-of-the-art banking technology and know-how, (ii) lack of economies of scale in funding, (iii) \nundercapitalization  and  high  levels  of  NPLs,  (iv)  a  legacy  of  government  influence  in  strategic \nfocus and in management, (v) lack of competitive experience due to the favored position in the \nrespective  city,  (vi)  a  history  of  deficient  corporate  governance  and  internal  controls,  and  (vii) \nlimited growth prospects within each respective city. \n \n14. \nTo address these issues, several logical evolutionary steps are needed for this sector: (i) \ntie-ups  with  (foreign)  strategic  partners  that  can  bring  operational  know-how,  a  competitive \nmindset, better governance, and capital; (ii) sales of significant equity stakes to nongovernment \nentities to dilute the influence of, and reliance on, the local government; (iii) cessation of further \nGovernment support to undercapitalized banks that are unable to meet CBRC capital adequacy \nrequirements  by  the  prescribed  deadlines;  (iv)  opening  up  of  cities  to  competition  from  other \nCCBs (initially from the same province, but eventually CCBs from any part of the country); and \n(v)  consolidation  of  CCBs  into  fewer,  stronger  banks  that  are  more  capable  of  exploring \neconomies of scale. \n \n15. \nThe  CBRC  has  outlined  a  four-point  reform  strategy  to  enhance  the  development  and \nsupervision of CCBs:8 (i) CCBs should define clear market strategies to focus on local residents \nand SMEs, playing to their inherent competitive advantages; (ii) CCBs should resolve impaired \nassets  through  close  cooperation  with  local  governments  and  other  means,  such  as  asset \nswaps  and  the  introduction  of  qualified  strategic  investors;  (iii)  CCBs  should  improve  their \ncorporate  governance  structure  and  mechanisms;  and  (iv)  the  CBRC  will  adopt  differentiated \npolicies and approaches in supervising different categories of CCBs, allowing a larger scope of \noperations for CCBs with sound management and good business performance, while preparing \na  \u201cmarket  exit\u201d  for  CCBs  with  high  risks.  Accordingly,  the  CBRC  approved  the  first  cross-city \nexpansion,  allowing  Bank  of  Shanghai  to  set  up  a  branch  in  Ningbo.  Further,  six  CCBs  and \nseven  UCCs  in  Anhui  Province  were  restructured  recently  into  Huishang  Bank\u2014the  first \nregional commercial bank in the PRC created from the restructuring of local financial institutions \nwithin one province. \n \n\n3. \n\nCCBs as Investment Opportunities \n\n16. \nSeveral international financial institutions have invested in PRC commercial banks, using \ntheir  investments  as  a  tool  to  understand  the  country\u2019s  banking  industry  and  accumulate \noperating  experience.  However,  the  integration  of  the  PRC  banking  industry  into  the \ninternational market is in its infancy. In light of the huge opportunities in the PRC market, foreign \nbanks  are  facing  the  challenge  of  how  to  formulate  and  implement  their  PRC  development \nstrategies. With the overwhelming size and limited availability of the SOCBs, foreign banks are \nlooking at JSCBs and CCBs as appropriate investments for entry into the PRC banking sector. \n \n17. \nThe  economic  profile  of  the  city  where  a  bank  is  located  largely  determines  the \ncommercial  attractiveness  of  an  investment  in  a  CCB.  Generally,  this  is  a  function  of  the \npopulation  size,  economic  growth  prospects,  and  investment  climate.  In  addition,  the  targeted \nbank  must  have  acceptable  asset  quality,  market  position,  and  management  willing  to \nimplement  changes.  Forbes  magazine  ranked  the  PRC  cities  with  the  best  investment \nenvironments:  Hangzhou,  Guangzhou,  Shanghai,  and  Shenzhen.  It  also  ranked  the  top  ten \n\n                                                 \n8 CBRC. 13 December 2005. CBRC outlined an overall strategy for supervision of city commercial banks.

Similarly, The Banker magazine \nsurveyed  and  ranked  the  general  competitiveness  of  50  CCBs  in  2004.  Bank  of  Shanghai \nplaced  first,  followed  by  Tianjin  CCB  (TCCB),  and  HZCCB. 10 The  Rating  Center  of  China\u2019s \nCommercial  Banks\u2019  Competitiveness  identified  the  top  five  commercial  banks  as  Bank  of \nShanghai, TCCB, HZCCB, Bank of Beijing, and Nanjing CCB.  \n \n18. \nNot all of the 112 CCBs will be able to attract quality strategic partners, however. Thus, \nin  the  medium  to  long  run,  only  a  handful  is  expected  to  lead  the  consolidation  and  market \nexpansion efforts. The Private Sector Operations Division (PSOP) of ADB believes that only the \ntop 15\u201320 CCBs will find suitable strategic investors, and 30\u201340 at most will survive in the long \nterm.  In  line  with  this  assessment,  the  Government  appears  prepared  to  take  a  hard  stance \nagainst  supporting  CCBs  operating  with  high  risks,  including  contemplating  closure. 11  The \nsurvivors will be the ones willing to change. To increase long-term viability and attractiveness to \npotential strategic partners, leading CCBs have focused over the past 2\u20133 years on improving \nasset  quality,  management,  systems,  and  operations.  Despite  these  efforts,  only  a  few  CCBs \nhave announced or completed equity investments with foreign strategic partners.12 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nThe  proposed  investment  involves  an  equity  participation  of  up  to  $30  million  (or  CNY \n\n19. \nequivalent) in HZCCB in the PRC, for approximately 5% of the bank\u2019s outstanding shares.13  \n \nA. \n\nProject Selection \n\n20. \nADB  uses  a  sector-wide  portfolio  approach  to  its  financial  sector  investments  in  the \nPRC. Landmark projects in each subsector are identified and pursued based on their potential \ndemonstration  effect  and  replicability  by  other  institutions  in  the  same  subsector.  To  this  end, \nADB has invested in one SOCB (Bank of China); one JSCB (China Everbright Bank); Xiamen \nInternational Bank, a foreign bank; and Credit Orienwise, a credit guarantee company based in \nShenzhen. Separately, ADB is pursuing other opportunities in the credit cooperative, rural bank, \nand  nonbank  subsectors.  As  such,  the  development  effects  of  ADB\u2019s  resources  are \nappropriately leveraged across the sector, and portfolio risk is diversified. \n \n21. \nIn  conjunction  with  the  East  Asia  Regional  Department  (EARD),  PSOP  made  the \nstrategic  decision  to  move  into  the  PRC\u2019s  CCB  subsector.  The  efforts  to  target  the  CCB \nsubsector began in early 2004 as a result of a joint PSOP-EARD mission to Tianjin and Dalian. \nThis  mission  generated  a  clear  understanding  that  a  successful  demonstration  effect  from  an \ninvestment in a CCB requires: (i) a local government supportive of change, and willing to modify \nand delineate its ownership role; (ii) a management team in place with a proven track record, a \nvision of strategic change, and the capability to implement it; (iii) a strong international strategic \npartner with expressed desire to invest in the CCB and cooperate with ADB; (iv) a local market \n\n                                                 \n9 Forbes.  2004.

June 2005. \n\n12 Beijing, Jinan, Nanchong, Nanjing, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xi\u2019an have announced deals. However, not all of \n\nthem have been signed or reached financial closure. \n\n13 The proposed equity investment received concept clearance on 20 October 2005. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfocused on private sector-led growth, as opposed to SOE-led economic activity; and (v) a bank \nwith the potential to lead the consolidation of the industry in the near to medium term. \n \n22. \nCCBs with these characteristics would produce the demonstration effect ADB is seeking. \nTherefore, ADB must team up with (i) a strong strategic investor that is willing to invest know-\nhow  as  well  as  capital,  and  (ii)  a  CCB  that  is  open  to  change.  Based  on  an  initial  market \nassessment and ranking of CCBs, PSOP undertook desktop analyses of some 20 CCBs. From \nthis  group,  PSOP  held  initial  meetings  with  seven  CCBs  during  2004  and  2005.  PSOP  also \ndiscussed potential targets with several international commercial banks interested in investing in \nCCBs  in  the  PRC.  From  this  process,  HZCCB  emerged  as  one  of  the  preferred  potential \ninvestment targets. \n \nCommonwealth  Bank  of  Australia  (CBA)  also  approached  ADB  to  gauge  its  interest  in \n23. \ninvesting in HZCCB. This was a natural progression from several discussions between ADB and \nCBA  over  the  previous  year  regarding  possible  cooperation  and  co-investment  in  the  financial \nsector in the PRC. CBA is interested in establishing a long-term relationship with ADB for follow-\nup investments in other regions of the PRC (especially Inner Mongolia and Western PRC), as \nwell  as  other  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMC).  ADB  indicated  its  interest  in  a  co-\ninvestment with CBA in HZCCB. However, due to a longer processing schedule, ADB noted that \nits own investment might not be ready at the same time as CBA\u2019s.  \n \n24. \nHZCCB had been in discussions with other potential investors alongside CBA, including \nthe  bilateral  German  development  corporation  Deutsche  Entwicklungs-Gesellschaft,  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  Temasek  Holdings  of  Singapore.  Following \ninteractions over the next 3 months, HZCCB and the local government decided that ADB would \nbe their preferred partner.  \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  investments  in  the  PRC  over  the  past  2  years  have  refreshed  the  view  in  the \ninternational  investment  banking  community  of  ADB  as  a  credible  investment  partner  that  can \nadd  significant  value.  As  such,  ADB  should  build  on  this momentum  to  maximize  the  catalytic \neffect its activities are yielding. ADB would strengthen its track record for follow-up investments \nin partnership with international commercial banks, especially in less-developed regions of the \nPRC (and elsewhere in the region), as well as in other selected subsectors of the PRC financial \nsystem. \n \nB. \n\nThe Investee Company: Hangzhou City Commercial Bank \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n26. \nHZCCB was formed in 1996 through the amalgamation of the Hangzhou\u2019s 33 UCCs. At \nthe  end  of  2005,  HZCCB  had  approximately  CNY46.3  billion  in  assets  ($5.8  billion)  and \nCNY27.1 billion ($3.4 billion) in loans. HZCCB is the fifth largest commercial bank in Hangzhou \nby assets after ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agriculture Bank of China (ABC) and Bank of \nChina  (BOC).  It  has  a  loan  market  share  of  approximately  5%.  China  Financial  News  Center \nranks HZCCB as the third best CCB in the PRC,14 while a recent Moody\u2019s report on PRC\u2019s CCB \nsubsector ranked HZCCB second.15 HZCCB offers a comprehensive range of banking products \nand services, including corporate and individual loans, deposits, trade finance, agency services, \n\n                                                 \n14 China  Financial  News  Center.  2005.

HZCCB \nhas  approximately  26,000  corporate  customers  and  1.5  million  individual  customers.  It  is  a \nmarket leader in the SME and mass retail segments in the city. \n \n\n2. \n\nBusiness Scope \n\n27. \nHZCCB\u2019s  business  is  divided  into  three  areas:  corporate  banking,  retail  banking,  and \ntreasury (money markets and investments). In terms of market positioning, HZCCB has branded \nitself as a \u201ccustomer focused\u201d local bank, offering one-stop services.  \n \n28. \nAiming  to  expand  its  service  offerings  and  deepen  its  client  base,  HZCCB  has  applied \nfor  a  foreign  exchange  business  license.  Further,  HZCCB  expects  to  apply  for  a  derivative \nlicense in 2007, when appropriate internal controls and risk management systems are ready for \nderivative products. HZCCB will be seeking expertise from CBA to help implement this process. \n \n\n3. \n\nCompetition \n\n29. \nHZCCB  commands  a  strong  competitive  position  in  the  Hangzhou  market  due  to  its \nlarge  branch  network,  close  alliance  with  the  local  government,  and  positioning  in  the  mass \nretail and SME segments. Including HZCCB, 16 commercial banks operate in Hangzhou. These \ninclude  the  \u201cbig  four\u201d  SOCBs  (ABC,  ICBC,  CCB,  BOC),  which  exert  the  main  competitive \npressure, and 11 regional banks.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nEquity Investment  \n\n30. \nADB proposes an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in CNY equivalent (or, if ADB \nis unable to fund in CNY, in US dollars) in HZCCB, to purchase or subscribe approximately 5% \nof the bank\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares, either via the purchase of shares available for sale by \nan HZCCB shareholder, or via subscription of newly issued shares by HZCCB. \n \n\n1.  Exit Strategy \n\n31. \nExit  would  be  considered  once  the  developmental  role  of  ADB  has  taken  effect. \nFollowing  the  planned  IPO,  ADB  might  sell  its  stake  in  the  public  markets.  Alternatively,  once \nownership and geographical limits are relaxed, CCBs might become targets for consolidation by \nbanks  aiming  to  increase  their  nationwide  coverage.  As  such,  ADB  might  sell  its  stake  in  a \nnegotiated  transaction  to  a  third  party.  CBA  also  might  be  interested  in  increasing  its  stake \nwithin regulations.  \n \n32. \nThe recent success of BOC\u2019s IPO shows the viability of this exit option. Investors from \nPRC; Hong Kong, China; and the US are keen to get access to bank shares in the PRC. A well-\nrun and highly profitable CCB would be an attractive alternative for investors looking for growth \ninvestment opportunities away from the mainstream. \n \n\n2.  ADB Capacity Transfer \n\n33. \nADB would assist HZCCB in the following areas: (i) improving corporate governance and \ninternal  controls;  (ii)  strengthening measures  for  combating  money  laundering,  corruption,  and \nterrorism financing; (iii) formulating an environmental management and safeguards system, and \nproviding  appropriate  training;  and  (iv)  formulating  a  strategy  for  SME  lending,  and  designing \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nnew  and  innovative  financing  products  and  tools  for  this  market.  ADB  would  enter  into  a \nstrategic  cooperation  agreement  with  HZCCB,  similar  to  the  one  between  CBA  and  HZCCB, \noutlining the terms and conditions of ADB know-how transfer. ADB and CBA have tailored their \nrespective programs to avoid overlap.16 \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for the ADB Investment  \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Rationale \n\n \n34. \nAn  efficient  financial  system  promotes  sustainable  economic  growth,  which  generates \nemployment  and  reduces  poverty.  Financial  intermediation,  particularly  through  the  banking \nsector,  is  the  main  engine  for  economic  growth.  The  banking  sector  dominates  the  financial \nsystem  in  the  PRC.  However,  the  inefficiency  of  the  sector  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the \ngreatest  obstacles  to  long-term  growth,  especially  with  regard  to  SMEs.  (Appendix  1). \nRecognizing  the  need  to  improve  the  banking  sector,  the  Government  has  encouraged  its \nbanks, especially SOCBs, to undergo reform. For certain qualified banks, the Government has \npromoted the involvement of private domestic and foreign strategic investors. The first stage of \nreforms targeted the \u201cbig four\u201d SOCBs. Now the focus of reforms is on the network of 112 CCBs \nthat  serve  major  urban  areas  throughout  the  PRC.  These  CCBs  play\u2014and  will  continue  to \nplay\u2014a vital role in and around the cities they serve, especially in SME development. However, \nCCBs will have to address some significant issues before they can improve, including strategic \nrisk, poor corporate governance, weak risk management, and low capital adequacy ratios. The \nsuccess of the PRC\u2019s banking reforms, SME development, and economic growth hinges on the \nability of the PRC banks, especially the CCBs, to address these challenges properly. \n \n35. \nCBRC  views  the  introduction  of  experienced  and  qualified  overseas  strategic  investors \nas an effective method to promote and enhance this reform process.17 On the micro level, the \nsale  of  strategic  stakes  in  these  banks  boosts  capital,  dilutes  government  influence,  provides \naccess  to  strategic  and  operational  know-how,  and  brings  better  corporate  governance.  The \nenhanced strategic focus and increased capital also will help the bank become more prepared \nfor  competition  in  its  home  market.  Further,  this  will  enable  the  bank  to  take  advantage  of \ngrowth  opportunities  in  new  markets  via  acquisitions,  mergers,  or  strategic  cooperation  with \nbanks  in  other  cities  and  provinces;  or  via  greenfield  organic  establishment  in  such  markets. \nHowever,  while  the  growth  prospects  of  the  PRC\u2019s  banking  sector  are  attractive  to  investors, \ninternational banks remain wary of taking minority stakes even in relatively higher-quality CCBs. \nTheir  main  concerns  are  (i)  the  untested  governance  framework;  (ii)  the  strategic  partner\u2019s \npotential  inability  as  minority  investor  to  influence  strategic  direction,  management,  and  equity \ndistributions; and (iii) uncertainty over the continued role of local government. \n \n36. \nIn  summary,  the  overall  progress  of  PRC  banks  is  still  lagging  behind  banks  in  other \ncountries  in  the  region.  The  lack  of  a  consistent  nationwide  credit  database  impedes  lending \n\n                                                 \n16 This capacity transfer for HZCCB, as part of the equity investment, is similar to the technical assistance package \nprovided  to  BOC  in  parallel  with  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment.  That  technical  assistance  was  to  improve  BOC\u2019s \ncorporate  governance  by  tackling  three  key  areas:  (i)  operational  risk  management,  (ii)  anti-money  laundering \nmanagement,  and  (iii)  environmental  risk  management.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  contributed  to  the  larger \nundertaking  by  BOC  and  the  Government  to  make  BOC  more  transparent,  commercially  sound,  and  properly \ngoverned. \n\n17 China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2005. Latest Developments in China\u2019s Banking Reform, Opening-up and \n\nSupervision. Beijing. 5 December. \n\n\fdecisions,  even  ignoring  the  cultural  and  political  incentives  against  steering  credit  away  from \nSOEs  given  this  information.  Administered  benchmark  lending  rates  also  distort  the  pricing  of \ncredit risk. The foreign ownership infusion thus far will not change things quickly, because of the \nminimal scale. While these are valid concerns regarding the PRC banking sector, they are also \na  strong  argument  for  ADB  involvement.  ADB  can  help  change  system  failures  through  a \nbottom-up  approach  that  tackles  issues  step  by  step  and  transaction  by  transaction.  In  ADB\u2019s \nview,  transactions  provide  critical  vehicles  for  \u201clearning  by  doing.\u201d  They  demonstrate  to \nGovernment officials and stakeholders the imperative to improve the country environment (e.g., \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks),  and  enable  the  identification  of  appropriate \ncountry-specific  priorities.  In  essence,  transactions  can  \u201ctest\u201d  for  priority  changes  and  signal \nappropriate  customized  enhancements,  creating  the  demand  and  dynamic  for  focused \nprioritized reforms.18 \n  \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact and Effectiveness \n\n \n37. \nIn  summary,  an  investment  in  HZCCB  would  impact  development  by  (i)  promoting  the \ndevelopment  of  a  lagging  financial  sector,  thereby  increasing  access  of  SMEs  to  finance,  in  a \nshowcase region with strong private sector, SME-driven economic development; (ii) supporting \nthe  transformation  of  a  leading  CCB,  especially  in  corporate  governance,  internal  control,  and \nenvironmental sensibility, which would send a strong demonstration signal to other CCBs in the \ncountry; (iii) indirectly fostering economic development of non-coastal regions in the PRC; and \n(iv) supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to restructure the banking sector. \n \n38. \nFinancial  Sector  Development  in  Zhejiang  Province  and  SME  Development.  The \nfinancial  sector  in  Zhejiang  Province  is  lagging  behind  the  rest  of  the  local  economy.  The \nZhejiang Province Finance Bureau19 reported that the financial services sector contributed only \n4.44% of the province\u2019s GDP in 2004, lower than the 6% national average. Thus, the Finance \nBureau  considers  the  need  for  reform  \u201cclearly  urgent.\u201d  The  Government  is  focusing  on \nencouraging  foreign  investors  to  invest  in  local  financial  institutions.  By  attracting  advanced \nmanagement  experience,  the  government  hopes  the  province  will  improve  the  ownership \nstructures  and  internal  controls,  and  strengthen  the  competitiveness  of  these  institutions.  To \nachieve this, the provincial government is adopting policies to support efforts to attract foreign \nfinancial institutions. \n \n39. \nA more developed financial sector in Zhejiang would enhance the service offerings and \nterms of financing for its SME-driven economy. SMEs are the drivers of economic growth in the \nPRC. However, their lack of access to bank financing remains a crucial stumbling block to more \nbroad-based development (Appendix 1). HZCCB would become a more responsive partner for \nthe  companies  in  an  economically  important  region,  as  well  as  force  competing  financial \ninstitutions in the region to improve their product offerings, service levels, and operations. Such \ncompetitive dynamics would yield widespread market benefits.  \n \n40. \nDemonstration  Effect  for  Banking  Sector  Reform.  A  successful  transformation  of \nHZCCB  could  be  replicated  by  other  investors  in  other  CCBs,  giving  this  Project  a  high \ndemonstration  effect  potential.  By  jointly  investing  in  HZCCB,  ADB  and  CBA  demonstrate  the \nvalue  of  HZCCB\u2019s  early  reforms  to  more  than  100  other  CCBs  that  are  struggling  to  achieve \n                                                 \n18  This  has  been  one  of  the  major  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  World  Economic  Forum,  Financing  for \nDevelopment  Initiative,  January  2006  (page  17),  with  respect  to  the  private  sector  operations  of  multilateral \ninstitutions. \n\n19 Zhejiang Province Finance Bureau. 2005.

In  PSOP\u2019s \nscreening of CCBs, HZCCB emerged as the best candidate for ADB\u2019s first investment in a PRC \nCCB. HZCCB, which ranks among the top four CCBs in the PRC, is a prime, SME-focused bank \nthat would enhance sustainable growth directly in the province. It has been a leader in resolving \nlegacy  NPLs  and  improving  credit  policies,  and  is  making  progress  in  enhancing  its  corporate \ngovernance.  \n \n41. \nEconomic Development.

As  a  result,  employment  at  borrowing  companies  would  be  sustained  or \nincreased, thus promoting job creation, economic growth, and poverty reduction. \n \n43. \nmeasures for development effectiveness. \n \n\nAppendix  4  presents  a  more  detailed  outline  of  the  major  development  outcomes  and \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Medium-Term Strategy \n\n \nThe proposed investment is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.21 The strategy \n44. \nstates  that ADB  seeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets,\u201d \nsince  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing  savings,  and \nensuring  availability  of  long-term  financing,  an  essential  requirement  for  pro-poor  growth.\u201d 22 \nPromoting  mainstream  finance  does  not  contradict  a  focus  on  poverty.  The  share  of  the \npopulation  living  in  poverty  is  closely  correlated  with  average  national  per  capita  income. \nHowever, the impact on poverty is typically indirect. It takes place through the multiplier effect \nthat a functioning financial sector has on the economy, including the strengthening of the SME \nsector and other growth engines. These indirect effects enable the economy to function better, \nincrease  jobs,  improve  the  scale  and  efficiency  of  capital  utilization,  and  increase  labor \nproductivity  and  demand. 23 The  proposed  investment  would  support  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy by assisting HZCCB\u2019s transition to a market-viable commercial bank, making the bank \nan example in the CCB subsector and a leader in the field of SME finance. \n \n45. \nMarch 2006, which declares the financial sector as a \u201ccore I\u201d focus area for ADB. \n \n \n\n The  proposed  project  is  also  in  line  with  the  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  (2006\u20132008)  of \n\n                                                 \n20  Examples  of  HZCCB  clients  having  invested  outside  of  Zhejiang  Province  include  Zhejiang  Glass  Factory,  which \ninvested CNY500 million in a remote area in Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the far west.

This  requires  financial  institutions  that  can  effectively \nmanage risk and allocate capital to productive investment.\u201d However, the report continues, a financial sector should \nhave high private sector participation, as best practices typically are driven by leading private sector banks.

ADB also adds value to HZCCB\u2019s shareholders by fulfilling the role \nof an \u201chonest broker\u201d that has only the bank\u2019s best interests at heart. \n \nC. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy24 \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  25 for  the  PRC  aims  to  address  poverty \n47. \nprimarily through pro-poor economic growth. At the center of this strategy is the enhancement of \nmarkets  by  promoting  good  governance  and  expanding  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations,  \nespecially in preparation for intensified competition in the financial sector brought about by WTO \naccession. \n \n48. \nThe  CSP  recommends  that  ADB  enhance  governance  in  the  financial  sector  by  (i) \nencouraging  financial  institutions  to  adopt  sound  corporate  governance  standards  in  harmony \nwith  international  best  practices;  (ii)  strengthening  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nframework,  as  well  as  the  institutional  capabilities,  of  financial  market  regulators,  banks,  and \nother  financial  institutions;  and  (iii)  setting  minimum  criteria  for  sound  corporate  governance \nstandards  by  market  participants.  Regarding  private  sector  operations,  the  CSP  specifically \nrecommends that ADB take equity positions in domestic financial institutions, such as banks, to \npromote financial sector reforms and good corporate governance. The proposed investment and \nits objectives, therefore, are in line with the CSP. \n \n49. \nFurthermore,  ADB  recognizes  SMEs  as  one  of  the  economic  growth  engines  in  Asia. \nConsequently, ADB has committed significant resources to promoting projects that assist SMEs \nthrough  country-specific  and  regional  TA  programs. 26  ADB  also  has  made  private  sector \ninvestments in financial intermediaries, such as banks, investment funds, and credit guarantee \ncompanies  that  target  SME  clients.  In  the  PRC,  SMEs  are  one  of  ADB\u2019s  key  operational \nobjectives. Through previous TAs, ADB has helped to draft the SME Promotion Law, as well as \nthe policies and regulations for the Government-sponsored SME Development Fund. ADB also \nsupported the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce to identify constraints faced by \nSMEs  and  the  private  sector.  The  output  of  this  intervention  became  an  essential  part  of  the \nPRC  Private  Sector  Assessment.  Further,  ADB  supported  the  enabling  environment  for \ndevelopment of SMEs from the supply side, specifically through two ADB TAs: (i) Development \nof  a  Small  and  Medium\u2013sized  Enterprise  Credit  Support  System  (TA  3493),  which  introduced \nbest international practices on credit guarantee mechanisms and identified constraints faced by \nSMEs  in  the  PRC;  and  (ii)  Development  of  SME  Financing  Support  System  (TA  3534),  which \nidentified policy and regulatory constraints faced by SMEs and alternative financing schemes for \nSMEs.  The  ADB  Private  Sector  Assessment  for  the  PRC27 encourages  ADB  to  support  the \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  works \nhand-in-hand  with\u2014and  complements\u2014ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC.  ADB  has \nmade  substantial  progress  over  the  past  2  years  in  developing  opportunities  for  equity \ninvestments in PRC financial institutions. In the process, ADB has created strong relationships \nwith local government officials, bank regulators, financial institutions, and potential international \nstrategic  partners.  These  efforts  are  starting  to  bear  fruit:  the  Government  and  financial \ninstitutions are looking to ADB as a value-added partner to invest and promote change. As the \nGovernment  pushes  forward  with  the  necessary  reforms  and  restructuring  of  the  financial \nsector, and international banks eagerly explore opportunities to invest in PRC banks, ADB has a \nwindow of opportunity to co-invest and add value. The visibility of successful equity investments \nshould  enhance  ADB\u2019s  overall  profile  in  the  PRC,  and  allow  ADB  to  maximize  developmental \nimpact. \n \nADB\u2019s strategy for financial sector investments in the PRC has been guided by the three \n51. \npillars  of  the  transformation  of  the  PRC  banking  and  financial  sector:  (i)  reducing  NPLs,  (ii) \nrestructuring  government-owned  banks,  and  (iii)  promoting  a  stronger  credit  culture  and \ncompetitiveness in the banking and financial sector. ADB\u2019s interventions have been targeted at \n(i)  reducing  NPLs  by  providing  financing  to  third-party  investors  participating  in  NPL  sales  or \nauctions;  (ii)  investing  in  PRC  banks  to  support  their  transformation  into  commercially  viable \ninstitutions  based  on  sound  corporate  governance  principles;  and  (iii)  providing  debt  and/or \nequity  funding  for  niche  banks  and  nonbank  financing  entities  (such  as  credit  guarantee \ncompanies) to enhance the credit culture and sector specialization, particularly for financing of \nSMEs. The proposed investment fits the latter two categories\u2014banking sector reform and SME \ndevelopment\u2014and forms part of a suite of private sector interventions by ADB that are designed \nto be complementary in impact and diversified in exposure. \n \n52. \nIn addition to the investment in BOC, ADB has made two previous equity investments in \nPRC  banks  to  support  sector  reform.  In  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  ADB  invested  in  China \nEverbright Bank and Xiamen International Bank. Through these investments, ADB learned the \nfollowing  key  criteria  for  success:  (i)  careful  assessment  of  the  willingness  of  the  investee \ncompany  to  implement  strategic  and  operational  change,  (ii)  Government  support  for  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment,  (iii)  thorough  due  diligence  and  appropriate  risk  mitigation,  (iv)  strong  strategic \npartners, and (v) a board representation in certain instances. All such issues are expected to be \nadequately addressed in this investment.  \n \n53. \nADB\u2019s first private sector investment to support SME development in the PRC was the \n$10 million equity investment in Shenzhen Orienwise Guarantee and Investment Co., Ltd.28, an \nSME-focused credit guarantee company. This transaction closed financially in March 2005. ADB \ncatalyzed an additional $25 million of equity from  CVC Capital Partners,  Hong  Kong,  a  wholly \nowned subsidiary of Citigroup. Currently, another equity partner is being catalyzed. The second \n\n                                                 \n28  ADB.  2004.

It is part of the business plan \nprepared by PSOP and EARD, as well as the wider examination of the CCB sector in the PRC. \nThe information and experience gained from this investment is expected to complement the joint \nresearch, and establish the basis for policy reform advice to the Government. \n \nE. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Issues \n\n55. \nThe  investment  has  been  classified  as  FI  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy.  ADB  will \nadvise HZCCB on its safeguard policies, and discuss their relevance and importance. HZCCB \nwill be required to adopt an appropriate environmental management system (EMS) and undergo \ntraining in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n \n56. \nSince the investment does not require  any resettlement and will not impact indigenous \npeoples,  the  investment  has  been  assigned  category  \u201cC\u201d  with  regard  to  ADB\u2019s  indigenous \npeoples and resettlement policies.  \n \nF. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy  and  Policy  for  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n\n57. \nHZCCB  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  Policy  for  Combating \nMoney  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  HZCCB  to  institute,  maintain, \nand comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards \nfor  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities,  or  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  HZCCB  will  be  required  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such \nactivities.  Further,  the  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  HZCCB  will  allow  ADB  to \ninvestigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. The financial due diligence \nconducted by Ernst & Young and Haiwen & Partners (Haiwen) did not reveal any major prior or \npending corruption cases.  \n \nG. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58. \nThe transaction documentation is expected to require HZCCB to furnish to ADB (i) within \n120 days after the end  of each financial year, accounts audited in accordance with applicable \nPRC accounting standards; (ii) within 60 days after the end of each half-year period, half-year \naccounts; (iii) within 60 days after the end of each quarter-year period, a balance sheet as at the \nend  of  such  quarter-year  period,  income  statement,  and  statement  of  profit  distribution  and \nappropriation  for  such  period,  certified  by  the  general  manager  of  the  accounting  and  finance \ndepartment;  and  (iv)  within  15  business  days  from  the  end  of  each  calendar  month,  monthly \nfinancial statements certified by the general manager of the accounting and finance department. \nADB will encourage HZCCB to adopt IFRS in parallel with PRC accounting standards.30 \n \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB.  2005.

To improve the financial \nsystem,  a  number  of  measures  have  been  implemented,  which  included  converging  PRC  GAAP  with  IFRS  to \nimprove  financial  reporting  transparency.  It  is  likely  that  IAS39  (Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and \nMeasurement) and IAS32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) will be applied from early 2007. \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBeginning with the financial year ending 31 December 2005, HZCCB has retained Ernst \n59. \n& Young to audit its annual accounts. In accordance with PBOC regulations, HZCCB is required \nto disclose to the public selected data and other information in April of each year. \n \nH. \n\nTransaction Risks \n\n60. \nADB  has  conducted  comprehensive  business,  financial,  and  legal  due  diligence  to \ndetermine  the  viability  of  the  investment.  ADB  has  retained  Ernst  &  Young,  an  international \naccounting and auditing firm specializing in transaction services for potential investors, to assist \nin  the  financial  due  diligence.  It  also  has  retained  as  international  counsel  Clifford  Chance,  a \nleading law firm specializing in corporate and investment law in the PRC and the rest of Asia. \nFurther,  ADB  has  retained  Haiwen  as  PRC  counsel  to  assist  in  the  legal  due  diligence  and \nnegotiation of the investment documentation. In addition to meetings with senior management, \nADB,  Ernst  &  Young,  and  Haiwen  &  Partners  had  access  to  detailed  data  and  financial \ninformation from HZCCB, as well as full disclosure by CBA of the due diligence it carried out for \nthis investment (which covered in detail operational matters, such as IT and human resources). \n \n61. \n \n \n\nThe due diligence and review of HZCCB\u2019s strategy support an investment by ADB.  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n62. \nThe proposed investment, which is PSOD's 14th in the PRC, would, once approved by \nthe Board, represent 1.7% of PSOD's total exposure,31 increase its investments (i) in the PRC \nby  1.4  percentage  point,  from  14.4%  of  PSOD's  total  exposure  to  15.8%;  and  (ii)  in  banking \nsystems  from  17.6%  to  19.0%.  The  proposed  investment  is  within  the  approved  aggregate, \ncountry,  industry,  group,  single  project  and  equity  investment  limits  for  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \nprojects. ADB will not be the single largest investor, and its investment will not exceed the 25% \nof total capital of HZCCB. \n \n63. \nA framework agreement confirming ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto  its  equity  investments  and  lending  operations  in  the  private  sector  is  in  effect  between  the \nPRC and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the \nGovernment  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  ADB  equity \ninvestment. No investment will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \nADB will enter into negotiated share purchase and subscription agreements, and other \n64. \nlegally  required  documents,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  investment  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors. These agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n31  Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of committed loan, equity investments, and guarantees as  of 31 \n\nMarch 2006. An investment is considered committed when the legal agreements are signed. \n\n\fVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n65. \nI am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the ADB and recommend that the Board approve the investment of up to $30,000,000 in CNY \nequivalent (or, if ADB is unable to fund in CNY, in US dollars) for approximately 5% of the equity \nin  HZCCB  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  on  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as will be reported to the Board. \n\n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n30 June 2006 \n \n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n   Appendix 1 \n\nTHE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) ECONOMY \n\nEconomic Overview \n\n \n1. \n \nThe  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  increased  from  $150  billion  in  1980  to  an \n1. \nestimated $2.26 trillion in 2005, with an average annual growth of over 9%. Its foreign trade rose \nduring  the  same  period  from  $20  billion  to  $1.2  trillion,  surpassing  that  of  Japan.  The  PRC  is \ncurrently the fourth largest economy in the world, upon revised GDP growth figure of 10.1% in \n2004  and  official-estimate  of  9.9%  for  2005,  surpassing  the  United  Kingdom  and  France;  by \n2015  it  could  be  the  third  largest  economy,  surpassing  Germany.  The  PRC  is  rated  A-  by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and A2 by Moody\u2019s. \n \nStrong economic growth has substantially increased per capita income. In particular, the \n2. \nper capita annual disposable income of urban households has risen significantly over the past 4 \nyears (Table A1.1; data for 2005 not yet available). Such growth will foster a growing demand \nfor banking products and services.  \n \n\nTable A1.1: Key Economic Data \n(As of the year ended 31 December) \n\n2004 \n\n2000 \n8,947\n8.0\n1,267\n7,086\n6,280\n\nItem \nNominal GDP (CNY billion) \nReal GDP growth (%) \nPopulation (in millions) \nGDP per capita (CNY) \nannual \nPer \ndisposable  income  of  urban \nhouseholds (CNY) \n \u2014 = not available, CNY = yuan, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Based on preliminary estimates by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC. \n\n2005\n15,988  18,232 a\n9.9 a\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n2002 \n10,240\n8.0\n1,285\n7,997\n7,703\n\n2003 \n11,669\n9.1\n1,292\n9,032\n8,472\n\n2001 \n9,731\n7.3\n1,276\n7,651\n6,860\n\n10.1 \n1,308 \n11,586 \n9,422 \n\ncapita \n\n \n3. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  economy  appears  to  be  accelerating  in  2006,  after  a  modest  slowdown  in \n2005, with year-end 2005 GDP growth estimated at 9.9%. Net exports and investment continue \nto  drive  the  growth  momentum,  and  thus  far  higher  global  oil  prices  does  not  appear  to  have \ndented  domestic  demand,  higher  energy  prices  have  not  fed  through  to  inflation,  and  core \ninflation remain below 1%.  \n \n4. \nPublic  sector  demand  dynamics  have  improved  with  the  country\u2019s  strong  fiscal \nperformance  in  recent  years.  The  fiscal  deficit  narrowed  from  2.9%  of  GDP  in  2002  to  an \nestimated 1.9% of GDP for 2005, despite increased spending as a share of GDP. Expenditure \noutlays  were  up  15%  year-on-year  in  1H05  amid  higher  outlays  on  social  security  and  the \nagricultural sector. \n \n5. \nThe strong economic performance of recent years has been anchored in export-oriented \nindustrial  production  and  powered  by  investment.  In  2005,  the  industry  sector,  primarily \nmanufacturing  and  construction,  contributed  7.1  percentage  points  to  the  total  GDP  growth \noutturn  (accounting  for  71%  of  overall  growth);  the  contribution  of  agriculture  declined  to  0.5 \npercentage points (6%); and that of services was little changed at 2.3 percentage points (23%). \nOn  the  demand  side  vibrant  investment  again  propelled  growth,  contributing  5.9  percentage \npoints to total growth in 2005 (60% of overall growth); consumption contributed 3.2 percentage \npoints (32%); and net exports just under 1 percentage point (8%). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n17\n\n \n6. \nDespite  strong  economic  expansion,  consumer  inflation  eased  to  1.8%  in  2005.  Food \nprices barely rose and productivity improvements helped insulate consumer goods prices from \nthe rising costs of production materials and labor. Oversupply of some products and moderate \ndemand intensified competition among producers, also discouraging price rises. \n \n7. \nThe  phenomenal  economic  expansion  has  led  to  various  structural  weaknesses, \nincluding  overcapacity  in  certain  sectors,  widening  income  inequalities,  and  environmental \nproblems. \n \n2. \n\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the PRC \n\nTable A1.2: Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Growth Trend \n\n% Increase,\n2003-2000 \n  86 \n104 \n104 \n184 \n\nItem \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\nTotal asset ($ billion) \nTotal equity ($ billion) \nSales ($ billion) \nNet profit ($ billion) \n  Notes:   1.

Agriculture  is \nforecast to expand by about 5.0\u20135.5%, industrial growth is forecast to slow to 9\u201310% from about \n11%  in  the  past  2  years,  as  a  consequence  of  significant  oversupply  in  some  sectors, \nmoderation of investment expansion, and deceleration in export growth. The services sector is \nexpected  to  grow  by  9.5%  in  2006,  aided  by  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  private \nconsumption  and  services.  Notwithstanding  the  aim  of  rebalancing  demand  toward  private \nconsumption and an anticipated slowing of growth of capital spending in manufacturing and real \nestate, investment will remain the dominant driver of growth in 2006 and 2007. \n \n10. \nIn  2006,  merchandise  export  growth  is  likely  to  moderate  to  20%.  Import  growth  is \nforecast  at  a  similar  rate,  as  demand  for  energy,  basic  materials,  agricultural  products,  and \nintermediate industrial inputs will continue to expand rapidly. A rising merchandise trade surplus \nwill be partly offset by a deficit on the services account. The current account surplus as a share \nof GDP is expected to be in the range of 5\u20137% in 2006\u20132007. \n \n11. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Despite the monetary and financial sector reforms,2 the financial sector does \n1. \nnot  meet  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Indirect  monetary  policy  instruments  (e.g.,  open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest  rate  policy  remains  inflexible.  The \nregulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  banks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  remains \nweak.  Despite  substantial  progress, 3  the  capital  markets  are  underdeveloped  and  not \nadequately  regulated  and  supervised.  Weaknesses  in  the  banking  sector,  high  levels  of \nnonperforming loan (NPLs), incomplete state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, and incomplete \npension  reforms  remain  causes  of  concern.  The  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  (PBOC),  the  China \nSecurities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC),  the  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission \n(CIRC),  and  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  are  placing  increased \nemphasis on improving corporate governance in the financial sector. \n \nSince  2003,  banking  sector  regulatory  and  supervisory  responsibilities  have  been \n2. \ndivided  between  PBOC  and  CBRC.  PBOC,  guided  by  the  State  Council,  is  responsible  for \nformulating and implementing monetary policy and for enacting safeguards to ensure financial \nstability.  CBRC  is  the  main  regulator  of  the  banking  sector  and  its  responsibilities  include \nformulating and enforcing the supervisory rules and regulations governing bank institutions. \n\n \nBanking.  There  are  4  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs),4 3  policy  banks,5 12 \n3. \njoint-stock  banks,  112  city  commercial  banks  (CCBs),  as  well  as  foreign  banks. 6  Banking \ndominates  the  financial  market  with  around  80%  share  in  total  assets. 7 The  profitability  of \nSOCBs and the policy banks is lower than what would be acceptable to commercial banks in a \nmarket  economy.  SOCBs  and  policy  banks  have  devoted  most  of  their  lending  to  SOEs  or \ndesignated  development  projects,  while  the  joint-stock  and  city  commercial  banks  are  more \nprivate sector-oriented and lend to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).8 \n \n4. \nPlans are implemented to modernize SOCBs and the joint-stock commercial banks have \nbeen encouraged to merge and restructure. The SOCBs will be corporatized as an initial step in \nthe  restructuring  process.  Over  the  last  4  years,  they  have  closed  more  than  21,000  branch \noffices  and  shed  more  than  100,000  personnel.  The  joint-stock  commercial  banks  are  now \nmoving to list on the stock exchanges. \n \nThe PRC regulators place numerous restrictions on permissible products, services, and \n5. \nactivities of domestic and foreign banks. For example, there are still restrictions on commercial \nbanks offering fee-based products. Interest rates on loans and deposits offered by commercial \nbanks are still subject to PBOC regulations even after recent reform measures that gave banks \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2   Adoption  of  the  Central  Bank  and  Commercial  Bank  Laws  in  1995;  the  ADB-supported  Securities  Law  in  1999; \nestablishment  of  CBRC,  CSRC,  and  CIRC  as  independent  regulators;  setting  up  four  asset  management \ncompanies to help address the NPL problems, and allowing more foreign participation in the financial sector; and \nseparation of CBRC from PBOC in 2003. \n\n3   The PRC did not have a capital market until the early 1990s. \n4   Agriculture Bank of China, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. \n5   China Development Bank, Agricultural Development Bank of China, and Chine Export-Import Bank. \n6   There are 240 foreign bank representative offices, 160 branches of foreign banks, and 13 locally registered foreign \n\nbank subsidiaries. Over 30 foreign banks obtained licenses to conduct yuan business before WTO accession. \n7   As of 2000, banking sector deposits stood at CNY12 trillion (150% of GDP), while loans were below CNY10 trillion. \n8   Twelve  percent  of  total  SOCB  lending  was  to  private  enterprises;  80%  of  non-SOCB  lending  went  to  small  and \n\nmedium-sized enterprises. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n21 \n\nmore latitude in setting such interest rates. On the other hand, the PRC Government has been \ngradually  liberalizing  the  banking  sector  by  allowing  new  product  offerings  and  expanding  the \nlimits  within  which  commercial  banks  may  set  their  CNY  lending  rates.  In  particular,  on \n29 October 2004, the PBOC removed the upper limit for CNY lending rates (other than rates on \nmortgage  loans  to  individuals)  charged  by  financial  institutions,  excluding  credit  cooperatives, \nwhile retaining the lower limit for such rates. Since that date, all deposit-taking institutions have \nbeen  permitted  to  decrease  (but  not  increase)  CNY  deposit  rates  to  below  the  corresponding \nPBOC benchmark rates. These changes give banks more freedom to develop products to meet \nmarket needs and to offer more flexibility in determining pricing of their products. \n \n6. \nThe five-category loan classification system was adopted at the end of 2001, after trial \ntesting  in  Guangdong  province. 9  Commercial  banks  now  stop  interest  accrual  if  a  loan  is \noverdue by 90 days. Banks are requested to make adequate loan provisioning for bad debts.10 \nAccording to CBRC, the NPL ratio of major commercial banks fell to 8.9% as of the end of 2005, \nor 4.3 percentage points lower than at the end of 2004. \n \nPRC\u2019s senior bank regulators acknowledged that the PRC banking system is not ready \n7. \nfor Basel II. A revised version of Basel I was announced in 2004 that requires an 8% minimum \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  plus  provisions  for  supervision  and  information  disclosure.  Banks  are \nrequired to meet the requirement before the end of 2006. At the end of 2004, 30 banks met the \nrequirement of 8% minimum capital adequacy ratio. China Banking Regulatory Commission has \nmade  it  clear  that  Basel  II  IRB  implementation  will  be  important  in  the  near  term  for  at  least \nPRC\u2019s large state-owned banks but no clear implementation timetable has been announced yet. \nThe top four state-owned banks\u2014the ICBC, the Bank of China, the Agriculture Bank of China \nand the China Construction Bank\u2014all have actually started preparing to implement Basel II and \nplan to invest heavily on IT infrastructure to meet Basel II requirements. \n \n8. \nCapital Markets. Although the capitalization of the securities market continues to grow, \nSOEs  dominate  the  listed  firms.  About  70%  of  the  SOE  shares  are  nontradable.  The \ngovernment  and  regulators  are  exploring  options  to  sell  state  shares  without  disrupting  the \nmarkets and allow entry of foreign securities firms in line with WTO accession agreement. \n \n \nWhile  market  forces  will  exert  pressure  on  how  listed  enterprises  are  organized  and \n9. \nmanaged,  corporate  governance  of  listed  enterprises  has  the  following  weaknesses:  (i) \nFragmented  control  structure  for  SOEs;  (ii)  opaque  ownership  structures;  (iii)  poor  internal \ncontrol  arrangements,  with  generally  dominant  management  and  board  of  directors,  weak \nindependent board of supervisors, and inadequate protection of minority shareholder rights; (iv) \nlow  or  no  professional  requirements  for  membership  of  boards;  (v)  restrictions  on  resale  of \nshares held by promoters and directors; and (vi) poor disclosure practices, lack of transparency, \npoor accounting and auditing practices, and misleading or fraudulent financial statements. \n \nFundamental changes are needed to strengthen the capital market. The Securities Law, \n10. \nCompany  Law,  Trust  Law,  and  other  related  regulations  need  to  be  rationalized  to  clarify \nCSRC\u2019s  investigative,  enforcement,  and  disciplinary  powers.  However,  the  implicit  preference \nfor listings by SOEs continues, despite the recent efforts to change the quota system. \n \n11. \nState-Owned  Enterprises. While the SOEs were the backbone of the PRC\u2019s economy \nduring the central planning era, their role in GDP has declined over the last two decades.11 The \n                                                 \n9   The five categories are standard, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. \n10 Although general provisioning before tax is allowed up to 1% of the total outstanding loans. \n11  The  contribution  of  SOEs  to  GDP  fell  from  58%  in  1980  to  37%  in  2000,  and  the  share  of  the  SOEs  in  gross \n\nindustrial output fell from 37% in 1994 to 25% in 2000, but they still account for 55% of employment. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ninterference,  poor \n\nfinancial  performance  of  some  SOEs  has  been  weak  due  to  poor  management,  poor \ntechnology,  political \ninvestment  decisions,  soft  budget  constraints, \noveremployment,  heavy  social  welfare  responsibilities,  and  lack  of  competitiveness.  In  recent \nyears, however, the performance of some SOEs has improved. \n \n12. \nBeginning in 1997, the Government of the PRC launched a campaign to reform SOEs to \nrestructure large SOEs that were able to compete globally and privatize small ones. Thousands \nof  smaller  SOEs  were  sold,  closed, or  merged.  About  26  million  SOE  workers  were  laid  off  in \n1998\u20132001.  Despite  the  corporatization  that  transformed  most  SOEs  into  limited  liability \ncompanies and about 1,000 SOEs being listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, \ncorporate  governance  standards  of  SOEs  need  substantial  improvement.  In  2002,  the  State \nEconomic  and  Trade  Commission  (SETC)  and  CSRC  formulated  codes  of  conduct  for  listed \nSOEs. No assessment has been made to verify the compliance of SOEs with these codes. \n \n13. \nRural  Finance.  The  rural  financial  system  comprises  a  policy  bank  (Agricultural \nDevelopment  Bank  of  China),  a  commercial  bank  (Agricultural  Bank  of  China),  and  the  rural \ncredit cooperative (RCC) system. Over 28,000 RCCs account for 13% of deposits and 10% of \nloans  of  the  banking  sector,  and  60%  of  agricultural  loans.  RCCs  are  controlled  by  various \nlevels  of  governments  to  channel  funds  to  SOEs,  township  and  village  enterprises  with \ngovernment  connections,  and  government  agencies  such  as  the  state  grain  bureaus.  Rural \nhouseholds, especially those with low incomes, lack access to formal credit. Large numbers of \nrural households must turn to moneylenders, friends, or relatives in the informal credit market. \n \nB. \n \n\nTrends in the PRC Banking Industry \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Growth Has Led to Growing Demand for Banking Products \n\n \n14. \nThe PRC\u2019s economy sustained strong growth in the past decade (see Appendix 1). This \neconomic  growth  has  substantially  increased  per  capita  income.  In  particular,  the  per  capita \nannual  disposable  income  of  urban  households  has  risen  significantly  over  the  past  3  years. \nSuch  growth  will  foster  a  growing  demand  for  banking  products  and  services.  Loans  by  and \ndeposits  with  financial  institutions  have  grown  rapidly.  Loans  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  15.0%  from \n1999 to 2004 (Table A4.1). The CAGR for deposits was 18.4% for the same period.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Loan Growth \n\n \n\nYear \n\nTotal Loans a \n\nTotal Deposits a \n\nYear on Year \nGrowth \nCNY (%) \n  8.3 \n  6.0 \n13.0 \n16.9 \n21.1 \n18.6 \n\n \n\nCNY billion \n9,373 \n9,937 \n11,231 \n13,129 \n15,900 \n18,857 \n\n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \nCNY = yuan. \na  Includes  the  loans  or  deposits  of  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China,  the  largest  four  commercial  banks,  joint-stock \ncommercial  banks,  rural  credit  cooperatives,  urban  commercial  banks,  financial  institutions  with  foreign \ninvestments, urban credit cooperatives, policy banks, financing companies, leasing companies and the PRC Post. \n\nCNY billion \n10,878 \n12,380 \n14,362 \n17,092 \n20,806 \n25,319 \n\nYear on Year \nGrowth \nCNY (%) \n13.7 \n13.8 \n16.0 \n19.0 \n21.7 \n21.7 \n\nSource: PBOC. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nCorporate Lending and Growing Demand for Retail Banking Products \n\n2. \n \n15. \nCorporate banking will remain the primary focus of the PRC banking industry in the near \nto midterm future, because of the sheer demand and growth potential. PRC corporations are the \ngrowth engine of the country\u2019s economic development. In the past, a large majority of loans by \nPRC financial institutions have been made to SOEs, a trend which will change as privatizations \nincrease.  In  addition,  newly  founded  privately-owned  corporations  are  becoming  increasingly \nimportant borrowers.  \n \n16. \nAs the PRC banking industry has liberalized, banking institutions have been allowed to \noffer consumer lending products. Rising incomes are likely to foster growing consumer demand \nfor banking products and services. It is anticipated that retail banking will continue to grow, with \nincreasing demands for mortgages and other consumer loans. According to the National Bureau \nof Statistics, consumer loans in the PRC totaled CNY2.0 trillion in 2004, representing 10.5% of \ntotal loans and 14.6% of GDP, and grew at a compound annual growth rate of 36.5% from 2002 \nto 2004. \n \n17.  Mortgage  loans  represented  the  majority  of  overall  consumer  loans  in  2003,  and  were \nfueled  by  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reform  the  housing  system,  under  which  employees  of \nSOEs previously received free or subsidized housing. Mortgage loans have grown rapidly from \nCNY609.9  billion  in  2001  to  over  CNY1.2  trillion  in  2003,  according  to  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction. \n \n18. \nThe  vast  majority  of  bank  cards  in  the  PRC  are  debit  cards.  There  are  approximately \n517,000  credit  and  points-of-sale  and  67,000  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs)  in  the  PRC. \nThe  credit  card  market  has  so  far  been  limited  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the  limited \nacceptance of cards by merchants, the underdevelopment of a national payment infrastructure, \nand  the  absence  of  a  nationwide  consumer  credit  information  system.  According  to  the  PRC \nUnionpay, an electronic interbank information exchange and transaction network, at the end of \n2004,  815  million  banking  cards  had  been  issued  in  the  PRC,  only  11  million  of  which  were \ncredit cards. \n \nC.  \n \n19. \nOverview. As at the most recent PRC NPL report (Fitch, 30 May 2006) the total gross \nNPLs  stand  at  $673  billion,  broken  down  in  these  three  categories:  (i)  total  official  NPLs  on \nbanks\u2019 books of $206 billion, (ii) NPLs carved out from banks and currently residing in one of the \nfour  AMCs  at  $197  billion,  and  (iii)  potential  problem  loans  (i.e.  from  Fitch\u2019s  estimate \ndowngrading of \u201cSpecial Mention\u201d loans in PRC banks) of an additional $270 billion. Note that \nthis estimate is lower than that initially made by Ernst & Young (12 May 2006) which tallied total \nNPLs  at  $911  billion  (including  a  very  large  \u201cpotential  future  amount\u201d),  a  figure  that  E&Y  soon \nretracted  as  \u201cerroneous\u201d  after  official  complaints  by  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China.

Fitch, and other analysts, acknowledges that \nwhile the NPL stock problem remains serious improvements have been achieved and estimated \nNPL  burden  on  the  PRC  fiscal  resource  is  not  as  dire  as  oftentimes  predicted.  Fitch  states: \n\u201cGenerally, we conclude that although significant progress has been made in lowering the NPL \nburden  of  China\u2019s  large,  premier  banks,  outside  of  these  select  entities  the  improvement  in \nasset  quality  has  been  less  dramatic,  and  much  work  remains  to  be  done  at  an  institutional \nlevel.  That  said,  the  estimated  costs  of  the  remaining  cleanup  are  not  as  burdensome  as  one \nmight think, particularly when considered in the context of the PRC\u2019s massive foreign exchange \nreserves (which topped $875 billion at end March) and fairly modest government debt.\u201d \n \n\n \n\nTable A3.3: Asset Quality Indicators 2002\u20132004 Weighted Average (by Total Assets) \n(%) \n\n \n \nItem \nNPLs/Total \nLoans \nLLR/NPLs \nNet NPLs/Equity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBig Four \n\n \n\n \nJSCBsb \n\n \n\n2005a \n11.7 \n \n50.5 \n\u2014 \n\n2004  2003  2002  2005  2004  2003  2002 \n   9.9 \n   2.6 \n  14.1   25.4   30.2\n 6.6 \n \n \n \n \n66.0 \n  49.9\n77.6  186.7\n\n  32.3   17.2     6.8  101.5\n  15.0\n174.1  278.6  356.5 \n\n  3.6 \n \n70.4 \n26.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \u2014 = not available, LLR =  loan loss reserves, NPL = non-performing loan. \n  Note: Italicized figures exclude data on Agricultural Bank of China. \n  a Excludes Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. \n  b Excludes Everbright Bank and Guangdong Development Bank. \n  Source: Bank Financial statements. \n \n\nTable A3.4: Financial Support Measures \n\n \n\nDate \n\nCapital Injections \n1998 \nDec 2003 \nDec 2003 \nJun 2004 \nApr 2005 \n       Total  \n\n \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ billion) \n \n\nRecipient \n\n33 \n23 \n23 \n  2 \n15 \n95 \n\n \nBig 4 State-Owned Banks \nBank of China (BOC) \nChina Construction Bank (CCB) \nBank of Communications (BOCOM) \nIndustrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nDate \n\nRecipient \n\n \nNPL Carveoutsa \n1999\u20132000 \n2004 \n2005 \n       Total \nAMC = Asset Management Company, NPL = non-performing loan, PBOC = People\u2019s Bank of China.    \na   In 2005, a fifth AMC was created to assume NPLs from PBOC, but information on the size and nature of  \n    the loans transferred is not available. \n\n \n \nBig 4 Banks and China Development Bank \nBOC, CCB and BOCOM \nIndustrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) \n \n\nAmount \n($ billion) \n \n \n169 \n  51 \n  85 \n305 \n\n           Source: Fitch.  \n \n21. \nSlow  NPL  Resolution. Despite the large stock of NPLs, the PRC NPL market (mainly \nGovernment  controlled  as  most  sellers  of  NPLs  are  state-owned  banks  or  AMCs)  have  been \nslow  in  facilitating  sizeable  resolution  transactions,  particularly  with  regard  to  establishing  a \npositive market attractive and clear for foreign funding and third-party distressed debt investors \nparticipation (i.e. not shuffling NPLs from one AMC to another AMC at accounting prices which \nmay not reflect actual expected recoveries from such transactions). In 2005, the total face value \nof large NPL deals was over CNY67 billion (approximately $8.5 billion) which is notable but still \nfar short of the hundreds of billions of $ worth of NPLs still languishing in the system.

Although  the  system  still  faces  some  major  challenges,  government  actions \ntaken in the past two years signify that industry reform is taking a major step forward. While the \nsector  is  still  characterized  by  ineffectual  corporate  governance,  weak  asset  quality,  low \nprofitability,  and  low  capitalization,  direct  and  indirect  capital  injections  from  the  Government, \nand  reform  efforts  by  the  banks  themselves  have  helped  the  sector  to  improve  its  financial \nprofile. In addition, intensifying supervisory efforts by regulators are slowly shaping the industry. \nGiven time, these efforts are likely to lay a solid foundation for the sector to build on. However, \nfinancial sector reform in the PRC is still very much a work in progress, and setbacks along the \nroad  are  only  to  be  expected.  Positive  factors  to  take  into  consideration  are:  (i)  a  strong \neconomy; (ii) government support; (iii) high level of commitment; (iv) improving ability to manage \neconomy; (v) strengthening regulatory oversight; (vi) strengthening corporate sector. \n \n\n \n\nSeller \n\nCinda \n\nHuarong \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nNegative  factors  to  take  into  account  are:  (i)  an  improving  but  high  level  of  problem \n23. \nassets.  Recent  cases  of  irregularities  involving  sizable  amounts  of  funds  have  highlighted  the \nfact that the sector still has a lot of work to do to strengthen its credit risk management and build \na  solid  credit  culture  across  individual  organizations,  which  are  needed  to  further  improve  the \nsector\u2019s  asset  quality;  (ii)  insufficient  capital.  While  recent  capital  injections  and  IPOs  have \nhelped  a  few  Chinese  banks  to  strengthen  their  capitalization,  the  banking  system\u2019s \ncapitalization  is  still  inadequate  to  support  the  sector\u2019s  rapid  asset  growth  and  cover  its \ninadequate  loan  loss  provisions;  (iii)  high  information  risk  and  high  gearing  in  the  corporate \nsector; disclosure standards and quality of information are still weak, though improving; and (iv) \nhigh  domestic  credit  to  GDP  (while  regulators  are  trying  to  rationalize  domestic  credit  growth, \ndomestic credit continues to grow at a brisk pace. It reached 141% of GDP at the end of 2004 \ncompared with 148% at the end of 2003, 138% in 2002, 127% in 2001, and only 103% in 1997). \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nTable A3.6: The People\u2019s Republic of China Banking Sector Market Dimensions (1995\u20132004) \n\nof which: \nMortgages \n(CNY B) \n\nTotal \nDeposits \n(CNY B) \n\nExcess \nDeposits \n(CNY B) \n\nGovt \nBonds \n(CNY B) \n\nCorporate \nBonds \n(CNY B) \n\nNominal \nGDP \n(CNY B) \n\n \nYear \n\nTotal \nLoans \n(CNY B) \n\nCorporate, \nCommercial \nLoans  \n(CNY B) \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n  7,341 \n  8,447 \n  9,394 \n10,453 \n11,200 \n12,913 \n15,401 \n16,848 \n\nTotal \nConsumer \nLoans \n(CNY B) \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n     17 \n     53 \n   164 \n   424 \n   699 \n1,067 \n1,576 \n1,988 \n\n5,376 \n1995 \n6,847 \n1996 \n8,212 \n1997 \n9,529 \n1998 \n10,831 \n1999 \n13,486 \n2000 \n15,472 \n2001 \n18,339 \n2002 \n22,036 \n2003 \n2004 \n25,319 \n\u2014 = not available, B = billion, CNY = yuan, GDP = gross domestic product.  \n\n5,231.0 \n6,310.0 \n7,358.5 \n8,500.2 \n9,558.7 \n10,876.3 \n11,899.0 \n13,980.0 \n16,977.0 \n19,422.0 \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n     13.0 \n     43.0 \n   136.0 \n   332.0 \n   560.0 \n   825.8 \n1,330.2 \n1,580.0 \n\n   145 \n   538 \n   853 \n1,029 \n1,273 \n2,610 \n3,573 \n4,359 \n5,059 \n5,897 \n\n  330 \n  436 \n  551 \n  777 \n1054 \n1302 \n1562 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n 65 \n 60 \n 52 \n 68 \n 78 \n 86 \n101 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n  5,848 \n  6,788 \n  7,446 \n  7,835 \n  8,207 \n  8,940 \n  9,593 \n10,479 \n11,669 \n13,657 \n\nNominal \nGDP \nGrowth \n(%) \n25.1 \n16.1 \n  9.7 \n  5.2 \n  4.8 \n  8.9 \n  7.3 \n  9.2 \n11.4 \n17.0 \n\n    Sources: China Banking Regulatory Commission, People\u2019s Bank of China, and Goldman Sachs research estimates. \n\nTable A3.7: The People\u2019s Republic of China Banking Sector Market Dimensions as Percent of GDP \n\nTotal \nLoans \n89.5 \n92.9 \n98.8 \n108.5 \n116.5 \n121.7 \n124.0 \n133.4 \n145.5 \n142.2 \n\n \nYear \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \nGDP = gross domestic product, Govt. = government. \nSources: China Banking Regulatory Commission, People\u2019s Bank of China, and Goldman Sachs research estimates. \n\nDeposits   Excess \nDeposits \n  2.5 \n  7.9 \n11.5 \n13.1 \n15.5 \n29.2 \n37.2 \n41.6 \n43.4 \n43.2 \n\nMortgages \n \n  0.0 \n  0.0 \n  0.2 \n  0.5 \n  1.7 \n  3.7 \n  5.8 \n  7.9 \n11.4 \n11.6 \n\nCorporate, \nLoans  \n    0.0 \n    0.0 \n  98.6 \n107.8 \n114.5 \n116.9 \n116.7 \n123.2 \n132.0 \n123.4 \n\nConsumer \nLoans \n  0.0 \n  0.0 \n  0.2 \n  0.7 \n  2.0 \n  4.7 \n  7.3 \n10.2 \n13.5 \n14.6 \n\nCorporate \nBonds  \n1.1 \n0.9 \n0.7 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n1.0 \n1.1 \n \n \n \n\nGovt. \nBonds \n  5.6 \n  6.4 \n  7.4 \n  9.9 \n12.8 \n14.6 \n16.3 \n \n \n \n\n  91.9 \n100.9 \n110.3 \n121.6 \n132.0 \n150.8 \n161.3 \n175.0 \n188.8 \n185.4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n2\n7\n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n \n\n1. \nThe  development  impact  assessment  of  a  financial  institution  (FI),  including  HZCCB, \nbegins  by  acknowledging  the  well-established  thesis  that  a  healthy  financial  sector,  populated \nby  healthy  financial  institutions,  promotes  sustainable  economic  growth,  helps  generate \nemployment, and ultimately reduces poverty. Therefore, the ability of an FI, in this case HZCCB, \nto  positively  impact  development  depends  on  various  indicators  of  its  \u201chealthiness\u201d,  through \nboth  qualitative  and  quantitative  measures,  as  well  as  broader  impact  beyond  HZCCB. \nDevelopment  indicators  can  be  categorized  along  two  key  parameters  within  the  Project\u2019s \nimpact  on  private  sector  development  via:  (i)  Project  (direct)  Company  impact  that  the  Project \ndelivers  to  and/or  by  HZCCB;  and  (ii)  Beyond  (indirect)  Company  impact  to  the  wider  sector
