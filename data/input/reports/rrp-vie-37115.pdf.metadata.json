Both  newly  constructed  and  upgraded \ncivil  works  will  include  capital  investments  to  improve  medical \nsolid waste management and wastewater disposal. \n \nThe Project will support the health system and improve the health \nstatus  of  residents\u2014especially  the  poor  and  disadvantaged\u2014in \nthe four provinces of the Central Highlands: Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon \nTum,  and  Lam  Dong.  The  Government  of  Sweden,  through  the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), will \ncofinance  the  Project.  The  Project  will  focus  on  providing  curative \nhealth  services  to  the  poor  and  disadvantaged\u2014including  ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  children\u2014by  upgrading  district  health \ncenters  and  enhancing  the  skills  of  health  care  service  providers. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  effective  implementation  of  the  new \ngovernment  initiative,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  139,  aimed  to \nestablish the Health Care Funds for the Poor. The Project will also \nemphasize  building \nthe  provincial  health \nthe  capacity  of \ndepartments for planning, financing, and managing health services. \n \nThe Central Highlands are one of Viet Nam\u2019s poorest regions, with \nrelatively  poor  health  indicators.  The  main  factors  contributing  to \nthe poor health are (i) inadequate access to quality and culturally \ncompatible  health  services,  (ii)  lack  of  appropriate  skills  among \nhealth  care  personnel,  and  (iii)  demand-side  issues  such  as  the \nlack  of  affordability  of  health  services  and  demand  for  public \nhealth  services  such  as \ninstitution-based  births.  Health \ninfrastructure  needs  significant  strengthening.  The  quality  of \nhealth  services  in  public  and  private  sectors  is  poor.  Health  care \nproviders\u2019  skills  need  upgrading.  Significant  capacity  building  is \nrequired to effectively implement Decision 139.  \n \n\n\fiii\n\nSpecific project objectives are \n(i) \n\nto  improve  availability  of,  and  access  to,  quality  health \nservices, especially for the poor and disadvantaged; \nto  improve  affordability  and  utilization  of  health  services, \nespecially for the poor; and \nto  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  health  system  to  address \neffectively the health needs of the people. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntotal  project  cost \n\n \nis  $30.6  million  equivalent.  Asian \nThe \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $20  million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, representing 65% of \nthe  total  project  cost.  The  Government  of  Sweden  is  likely  to \njointly  finance  the  Project  through  grants  of  about  $5.6  million \nequivalent. ADB will administer the funds from the Government of \nSweden using ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. \n \n\nSource \n\nADB \nSida \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nCost Estimates \n($ million) \nLocal  \nCost \n8.9 \n5.2 \n5.0 \n19.1 \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n11.1 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n11.5 \n\nTotal  \nCost \n20.0 \n5.6 \n5.0 \n30.6 \n\n% \n\n65.4 \n18.2 \n16.4 \n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, Sida = Swedish International Development \nCooperation Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR13,969,000  ($20 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, with a maturity \nterm  of  32  years  and  a  grace  period  of  8  years.

Medical  equipment,  supplies,  and \nfurniture  (23  packages)  will  be  procured  on \nthe  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  international  shopping,  local \ncompetitive bidding, or direct purchase. \n \nThe Project will use 32 person-months of services by international \nconsultants  and  573  person-months  by  domestic  consultants, \ncomprising  119  person-months  for  the  services  organized  at \ncentral \nto \nprovinces. The consultants will be recruited from consulting firms \nor as individuals, depending on the need. \n \nThe Project will have a significant impact on the health and well-\nbeing of the Central Highlands population. Since health is closely \nrelated  to  productivity,  it  will  also  help  incomes.  In  the  Central \nHighlands,  the  poverty  rate  has  remained  relatively  constant  at \nabout  52%  of  the  population  over  the  past  5  years,  while  it  has \ndeclined from 37% to 29% nationally over the same period. \n  \nThe Project will benefit 4.4 million people in the Central Highlands \nby  improving  quality  of,  and  access  to,  health  services.  These \nbenefits will target a rural population of 3.2 million, particularly the \n1 million poorest and 1.5 million ethnic minorities. The Project will \nreduce  the  excess  burden  of  disease  and  bring  it  in  line  with \nnational  averages.  It  will  also  help  the  provinces  achieve  the \nhealth  sector  targets  set  out  in  the  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy and the Millennium Development \nGoals.  The  infant  mortality  rate  will  drop  from  current  level  of  64 \nper 1,000 live births to 40 per 1,000 live births by 2008, maternal \nmortality ratio from 170 per 100,000 live births to 110 per 100,000 \nlive  births,  and  coverage  of  prenatal  care  will  increase  from  70% \nto 90%. \n \nThe Project will improve effectiveness and efficiency of the health \nsystem  in  the  four  provinces  by  upgrading  health  facilities, \npreventive \nand \nmanagement capacity, and increasing the quality of health service \ndelivery.  The  district  levels  will  emphasize  the  improvement  of \nquality health care provision and service delivery. The project will \nalso establish appropriate planning and management procedures \nat  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels  with  trained  staff  for \nensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  effective  and  efficient  health \nsystem. \n \nThe Project will support the Decision 139 to fully finance the cost \nof health insurance premium or reimbursement of health services \nfor the poor in the Central Highlands. \n\nstrengthening \n\ncenters, \n\ntraining \n\nhealth \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the \nhealth  system  in  the  four  provinces  by  upgrading  health  facilities \nand  preventive  health  centers,  strengthening \ntraining  and \nmanagement capacity, and increasing the quality of health service \ndelivery.

Viet Nam\u2019s health system \nis  well  established  and  has  been  quite  successful  in  delivering \nboth preventive and curative health services. \n \nExternally financed projects in Viet Nam, including those with ADB \nfinancing, have often been slow to make disbursements and meet \nprocurement \ninvestments  and \nfinalizing  documents  delayed  disbursement,  complicating  project \ntimetables.  To  reduce  this  risk,  the  Project  will  use  a  semi-\ndecentralized structure, largely eliminating delays caused by poor \ncoordination between national and provincial levels.  \n\ntargets.

Viet  Nam  has  already  achieved \nseveral MDGs, including those for poverty and child health, and is well on its way to achieving \nothers. Infant mortality fell by nearly 28% from 58 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 42 per 1,000 \nlive births in 2000. Maternal mortality decreased by 50% from about 200 per 100,000 live births \nin 1990 to about 100 per 100,000 live births in 2000. Access to reproductive health services, as \nmeasured by tetanus toxoid immunization, has increased from 71.7% in 1997 to 82.9% in 2001. \nImpressive achievements have also been made in controlling communicable diseases including \nmalaria and tuberculosis. The only MDG that poses a challenge is the controlling and reversing \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS.2 \n \n3. \nThe Government has a strong policy and institutional structure to support primary health \ncare, which has evolved over the last few years to pay greater attention to the needs of the poor \nand  disadvantaged.  The  Government  has  recently  launched  a  major  policy  initiative3  called \nPrime Minister\u2019s Decision 139, which is designed to ensure access to basic health care for the \npoor.  According  to  this  new  policy,  provincial  peoples\u2019  committees  will  establish  Health  Care \nFunds for the Poor (HCFP)4 to help those living in poor communes and selected ethnic minority \ncommunities gain access to the public health system. The Government has earmarked annual \nfunding  of  about  $50  million  for  HCFP,  which  demonstrates  its  commitment  to  improving  the \nhealth  status  of  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  There  has  been  a  greater  emphasis  on \ndecentralizing  the  management  and  provision  of  health  services  in  recent  years.  A  recent \nsignificant  policy  measure5  covers  all  revenue-raising  public  enterprises  and  public  service \nentities.  The  measure  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  services  by  making  entities  and \nagencies  financially  autonomous,  and  encouraging  them  to  take  initiative  in  determining  staff \nnumbers, compensation, and use. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nImpressive  achievements  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  health  system  are  tempered  by  the \n4. \nsignificant and persistent inequities in health status and use of health services. These inequities \nhave  in  fact  widened  in  recent  years.6  The  burden  of  disease  amongst  the  poor  and  ethnic \n                                                 \n1   The project framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n3   The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on \u201cHealth Care for the Poor.\u201d \n4   The  poor  are  defined  in  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs\u2019  Decision  No.  1143/2000/QD-LDTBXH  (1  November \n2000).

Bloom, N. Thang, and N. Huu. 2001. Human Capital of the Poor in Viet Nam. Asian Development Bank. \n\n\f 2\n\nminorities is much higher than among the non-poor. In particular, some groups and regions do \nnot  appear  to  have  benefited  from  the  country\u2019s  impressive  socioeconomic  transformation \nbecause they live far from main growth centers and have low levels of human capital. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  of  Viet  Nam\u2014comprising  the  four  provinces  of  Kon  Tum,  Dak \n5. \nLak, Gia Lai and Lam Dong\u2014is home to more than 4 million people and is one of the poorest \nregions  in  the  country.  Inhabited  by  a  large  number  of  ethnic  minorities  living  in  scattered, \nremote  communities,  the  region  has  inadequate  social  and  physical  infrastructure  despite \nsignificant  government  investment  and  commitment.  Recognizing  the  relatively  adverse  health \nindicators in the region (see Table 1), the Government has a special policy focus7 on improving \nthe  health  conditions  of  people,  particularly  ethnic  minorities,  in  the  Central  Highlands.  The \npolicy  calls  for  proportionately  larger  budget  allocation  for  the  region,  as  well  as  free  health \nservices  and  training  of  local  people  for  providing  services.  The  region  has  also  received \nsignificant investments from external agencies (Appendix 2). \n\n \nTable 1: Health Status in Viet Nam and the Central Highlands \n\nHealth Indicator \n\n \n\nCentral Highlands \n\nPoverty incidence (2002) \nUnder-5 Child Malnutrition  \nInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1998) \nMaternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births) \nAccess to Reproductive Health \n\n \n\nModern Contraceptive Use (%) \nPrenatal Care (3 or more visits, 2000) \nHome Delivery (%) \nSupervised Delivery (%) \n\n \nPrevalence of Malaria (per 100,000 persons) \nTuberculosis (per 100,000 persons) \nHIV/AIDS (per 100,000 people) \n\nViet Nam \n29.0 \n33.8 \n36.7 \n95.0 \n \n56.7 \n69.7 \n23.3 \n82.4 \n           332 \n           71 \n           56 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n52.0 \n40.9 \n64.4 \n170.0 \n \n41.6 \n44.8 \n55.1 \n59.6 \n\n         1,369 \n         26 \n         21 \n\nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \nNote: All indicators are for 2001, unless otherwise indicated. \nSource: Poverty incidence is based on the 2002 Viet Nam Multipurpose Household Survey. Data on \nunder-5  child  malnutrition  is  from  the  Bulletin  of  the  Symposium  on  Healthcare  Activities  in  the \nCentral  Highlands,  MOH,  2001.  Infant  mortality  rate  is  from  the  1999  Population  and  Housing \nCensus. Prenatal care is from the Symposium Bulletin, MCH/FP, MOH, 2003. Modern contraceptive \nuse, home delivery, and supervised delivery are from the Viet Nam National Health Survey, 2001-02. \nPrevalence of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS are from 2001 Official MOH statistics. \n\n \n6. \nThe  main  factors  contributing  to  the  poor  health  status  in  the  region  are  (i)  inadequate \naccess  to  quality,  culturally  compatible  health  services,  (ii)  lack  of  appropriate  skills  among \nhealth  care  personnel,  and  (iii)  demand-side  issues  such  as  the  lack  of  affordability  of  health \nservices and demand for certain public health services such as institution-based births. These \nfactors  are  interrelated  and  stem  in  part  from  the  same  socioeconomic  and  cultural  causes. \nCultural  beliefs  and  practices,  low population  density,  lack of  adequate  physical  infrastructure, \nand poverty all contribute to poor health status (see Appendix 3 for detailed analysis). \n \n\n1. \n\nHealth Facilities \n\nPrimary  health  care \n\n \n7. \nintercommune \npolyclinics\u2014is already well established in the Central Highlands. This has been partly supported \nthrough  earlier  projects8  financed  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  However,  curative  health \n                                                 \n7   Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 168/2001/QD-TTG dated 30-10-01 on Long-term perspectives, 5-year plan for 2001-2005 and key \n\ninfrastructure\u2014commune  health  centers  and \n\nsolutions for socio-economic development in the Central Highlands. \n\n8   Loan 1460 VIE: Population and Family Health Project approved in November 1996 for $43.0 million supported Dak Lak and Lam \n\nDong provinces; World Bank-supported National Health Support Project covered Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Kon Tum provinces. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nservices at the district level require considerable strengthening. For most people living in rural \nareas, the district health centers (DHCs) are the first level of referral care and comprehensive \ncurative services. The Government plans to strengthen health facilities at this level throughout \nthe  region  and  has  already  made  considerable  investments.  However,  there  remains  a \nconsiderable gap in the quality of health services in the region and the rest of the country.  \n \n8. \nThe  recently  implemented  Decision  139  provides  further  justification  for  strengthening \ndistrict-level health infrastructure. This initiative will reduce financial constraints on using health \nservices and is likely to significantly increase the use of district health services by the poor and \nethnic minorities. Use of health services, particularly inpatient services, has already increased in \nmost  provinces  since  the  adoption  of  Decision  139.  With  full  implementation  of  Decision  139 \nand  wider  dissemination  of  information  about  its  benefits,  utilization  of  health  services  will \nincrease  even  more.  Existing  capacity  at  the  district  level  will  be  insufficient  to  cope  with  the \nincreased  demand.  Some  40%  of  the  population  in  the  Central  Highlands  will  benefit  from \nDecision 139 because the region has a high incidence of poverty and a large number of ethnic \nminorities. The existing capacity of the region\u2019s district health system is  already stretched and \nwill not be able to effectively meet increased demand. \n \n9. \nThe capacity of inpatient wards to meet the increased demand is the biggest constraint \non  DHCs.  Some  DHCs  require  upgrading  or  expansion.  Others  will  need  to  be  moved  and \nrebuilt  in  more  accessible  areas.  Current  district  facilities  have  poor  water  supply,  sanitation, \nand solid waste disposal. Medical equipment also needs considerable support, both to replace \nold  and  outdated  equipment  and  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  service.  Imaging  and  diagnostic \nequipment are particular concerns in most district facilities. \n\n \n2. \n\nHuman Resources \n\n \n10. \nBoth  quality  and  quantity  of  health  personnel  constrain  services  in  the  region.  The \nCentral Highlands have about 10% fewer health personnel per capita. Given the low population \ndensity  and  large  geographical  distances,  fewer  staff  significantly  affect  services,  particularly \noutreach. The quality of health care providers is also much poorer in the Central Highlands than \nin the rest of the country.  \n \n11. \nThe  region  faces  the  twin  challenge  of  (i)  upgrading  the  technical  skills  of  health \nprofessionals,  and  (ii)  ensuring  continued  maintenance  of  applied  skills.  Lack  of  skills  is \nparticularly  acute  for  medical  doctors  in  the  areas  of  surgery,  obstetrics,  pediatrics,  internal \nmedicine, infectious diseases, and public health. Basic health care is difficult to provide at the \ndistrict  level  in  the  absence  of  specialized  doctors.  There  is  also  a  need  to  train  health  care \nproviders  who  speak  the  local  language.  Improving  frontline  primary  care  services  are  is  also \nneeded  to  improve  quality  of  care  at  the  commune  and  district  levels.  Strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  secondary  medical  schools,  responsible  for  providing  primary  pre-service  and  in-\nservice training, is also required to improve quality of clinical health services. \n \n\n3. \n\nDemand for Health Services \n\n \n12. \nLack of affordability is the major demand-side constraint for the poor in accessing health \nservices.  Decision  139  is  a  bold  initiative  taken  to  address  this  constraint  for  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  populations  through  the  establishment  of  the  HCFP.  This  will  help  improve  the \nhealth  status  of  the  poor  by  increasing  their  access  to  and  utilization  of  health  services.  It  will \nalso  potentially  reduce  the  impact  of  high  out-of-pocket  health  care  expenses  on  household \nbudgets.  Promising  as  it  is,  the  success  of  the  policy  initiative  cannot  be  taken  for  granted. \n\n \n\n\f 4\n\nSuccess  of  Decision  139  will  depend  on  the  ability  of  the  Government  and  provinces  to  (i) \nallocate  sufficient  resources;  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  and  guidelines  for  allocating  and \nmanaging  funds,  benefit  packages,  and  payments  to  providers;  (iii)  develop  a  transparent \nsystem  for  identifying  beneficiaries;  (iv)  empower  beneficiaries  to  expect  and  demand  the \nintended services; and (v) institutionalize a system of monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of \nthe  implementation  and  impact  of  Decision  139.  Support  is  needed  for  these  aspects  of  the \ninitiative. \n \nCultural  and  language  barriers  are  another  challenge  for  making  health  services  more \n13. \naccessible to the poor, especially ethnic minority groups. Health promotion and prevention will \nbecome increasingly more important as the burden of disease changes from communicable to \nthe noncommunicable diseases. This will require significant changes in the materials developed \nfor  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  and  in  the  ways  health  messages  are \ndisseminated.  This  will  entail  greater  community  involvement  in  providing  and  monitoring \nservices,  and  more  culturally  sensitive  health  promotion  and  behavior  change  communication \n(BCC) programs. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n14. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  health  system  and  improve  the  health  status  of  people\u2014\nespecially the poor and disadvantaged\u2014in the four Central Highlands provinces: Dak Lak, Gia \nLai, Kon Tum, and Lam Dong. Specific project objectives are \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto improve availability of, and access to, quality health services, especially for the \npoor and disadvantaged; \nto improve affordability and utilization of health services, especially for the poor; \nand \nto strengthen the capacity of the health system to address effectively the health \nneeds of the people. \n\n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n15. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  an  extensive  review  of  health  needs  and  investment \noptions in the Central Highlands. The Project was developed in consultation with the Ministry of \nHealth  (MOH),  provincial  and  district  authorities,  communities,  and  international  agencies \nworking in the health sector. The Project has the following three components: \n \n\n1. \n\nUpgrading Facilities and Equipment \n\n \n16. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  improving  the  quality  of  care  and  utilization  of  services  that \naddress the immediate health needs of the rural population. It will also strengthen the capacity \nof the provincial health system to meet the increased demand for health services stemming from \nthe implementation of Decision 139. The Project will ensure that these services are sustainable. \n \n17. \nCurative  Health  Services.  The  major  focus  will  be  on  strengthening  the  DHCs,  which \noften represent the first level of care in the community. People living in rural and remote areas \noften seek curative services from these health centers. The DHCs include inpatient, diagnostic, \nand  treatment  facilities,  as  well  as  other  clinical  support  facilities.  The  Project  will  also \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nstrengthen  the  referral  system  and  support  a  regional  hospital  to  develop  local  capacity  to \ndiagnose and treat complicated health conditions. \n \n18. \nThe Project will finance upgrading of services in 15 DHCs. The exact scope of activities \nvaries  from  the  center  to  center  and  is  based  on  the  needs  and  projected  utilization  of  the \ncenter. In 13 DHCs, support will be provided for new facilities and upgrading of inpatient wards, \ntechnical blocks, solid waste management, and water and sanitation systems. Support for solid \nwaste management and water, and sanitation systems will also be provided in 2 DHCs. \n \n19. \nThe Project will also finance the procurement of appropriate equipment for 16 DHCs to \nimprove service quality. The new equipment will (i) replace old and non-functioning equipment; \nor  (ii)  upgrade  technology  for  existing  procedures;  or  (iii)  seek  to  provide  new  services.  The \nProject  will  ensure  that  health  personnel  are  properly  trained  to  use  the  equipment,  and \noperational  manuals  are  supplied  in  Vietnamese.  The  Government  has  provided  assurances \nthat  equipment  will  be  maintained  during  and  beyond  the  project  period  through  adequate \nincreases in operation and maintenance budgets. \n \n20. \nThe  Project  will  also  provide  some  limited  support  for  a  provincial  hospital  in  Dak  Lak, \nwhich  is  becoming  a  regional  hospital  to  support  the  tertiary  health  care  needs  for  the  entire \nCentral Highlands. It will act as a model for health services and will provide training for health \ncare  providers  in  the  region.  The  Government  largely  finances  the  hospital.  The  Project  will \nsupport the procurement of its medical equipment. The Project will also support strengthening of \nthe referral system and networking between provinces and the hospital. \n \nPreventive  Health  Services.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  preventive  health \n21. \ninfrastructure\u2014including  the  provincial  preventive  health  centers,  social  disease  centers,  and \nIEC  centers\u2014to  combat  communicable  diseases  and  generate  demand  for  public  health \nservices. \n \n22. \nProvincial  preventive  health  centers,  located  in  the  provincial  capitals,  provide \ninstitutional  and  research  support  for  overall  monitoring,  supervision,  and  management  of \nepidemics  and  outbreaks  at  the  provincial  and  national  levels.  The  Project  will  support  the \nstrengthening  of  these  preventive  health  centers  to  increase  effectiveness  of  national  health \nprograms in all four provinces. In Lam Dong province, the Project will support construction of a \nnew facility and provision of laboratory equipment. In other provinces, government funds will be \nused to build new facilities and the Project will support upgrading of laboratory equipment. This \nsupport  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  related  training  to  laboratory  technicians  and \ndevelopment  of  more  effective  system  for  monitoring  and  surveillance  of  major  health \nconditions. \n \nThe Project will support strengthening of the social disease centers in all four provinces. \n23. \nThese  social  disease centers  are  located  close  to  provincial  health  centers  to  provide  support \nfor tuberculosis, leprosy, and sexually transmitted infections.9 They manage implementation of \nnational  programs  for  these  diseases.  The  Project  will  upgrade  laboratories  to  improve  their \ncapacity to diagnose and treat the diseases, and to monitor more effectively implementation of \nnational programs. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Tuberculosis,  leprosy,  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  are  commonly  referred  to  as  \u201csocial  diseases\u201d  in  Viet \n\nNam. \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\nIEC  centers,  located  at  provincial  headquarters,  implement  and  supervise  the  BCC \n24. \ncomponent  of  almost  all  health  programs,  and  produce  and  disseminate  public  health \nmessages. These IEC centers have been only recently established. The Project will strengthen \ntheir  capacity  to  manage  more  effective,  culturally  responsive  BCC  efforts  by  supporting  new \nIEC facilities, equipment, and training in Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum provinces. \n \n\n2. \n\nHuman Resources Development  \n\n \nRecognizing the critical need to improve the skills of health care providers in the region, \n25. \ntraining  activities  form  a  significant  part  of  the  Project.  It  will  finance  several  training  activities \nand  strengthen  the  secondary  medical  schools  in  the  four  provinces.  The  Project  will  support \nclinical training for doctors and nurses, as well as primary health care and BCC training.  \n \n26. \nClinical Training. The Project will upgrade technical skills of medical staff at the district \nand  provincial  health  centers  in  internal  medicine,  emergency  care,  surgery,  pediatrics, \nobstetrics,  gynecology,  infectious  diseases,  and  public  health.  Training  will  entail  two  types  of \nprograms.  One  program  provides  a  3-month  attachment  at  the  provincial  hospital.  About  408 \ndistrict medical officers will participate in this program. The Project will also support a program \nto train 209 nurses and other health personnel in clinical skills. A second program will provide \nspecialist degrees for selected medical staff at district and provincial levels. This will benefit 204 \ndoctors.  Courses  will  be  organized  in  medical  schools  in  Hue,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  Hanoi. \nTraining in clinical skills will assist in fully utilizing the investments made in upgrading the health \nfacilities. It will also boost health care providers\u2019 motivation and help attract and retain qualified \nmedical professionals.  \n \n27.  Many  candidates  from  ethnic  minority  groups  cannot  successfully  compete  through \nentrance examination for postgraduate medical degrees because they often lack language and \nstatistical skills, so the Project will support a coaching program to help them better prepare for \nthe  examination.  In  addition,  a  certain  percentage  of  all  vacancies  for  postgraduate  degree \ncourses will be reserved for candidates from ethnic minority groups. \n \n28. \nPrimary Health Care Training. The Project will finance training of 1,720 commune- and \ndistrict-level health workers on quality of care. Secondary medical schools in each province will \norganize these courses. The training curricula will draw on the experience of similar efforts by \nMOH  in  other  projects  and  regions.  The  scope  and  extent  of  commune-level  training  will  be \nassessed jointly with Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) during the \nmidterm  review.  Depending  upon  the  outcome  of  the  assessment,  these  activities  may  be \nfurther expanded. The Project will also support annual training programs for BCC activities, i.e. \ncounseling  and  mass-media  campaigns.  IEC  centers  in  each  province  will  plan  and  organize \nthese  training  programs,  which  will  target  240  people.  The  major  objective  of  these  programs \nwill be to make the health services more responsive to the poor and ethnic minorities. \n \n29. \nSecondary  Medical  Schools.  Secondary  medical  schools  are  key  to  training  and \nmaintaining  a  qualified  health  workforce.  The  Project  will  support  strengthening  secondary \nmedical schools to increase their capacity to provide strong training programs. The Project will \nsupply training equipment in the four provinces. In Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces, the Project \nwill support construction of teaching rooms, practice rooms, and a hostel. The Project will help \nthe Dak Lak school become a regional training school, providing support to the entire region. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Financing and Management \n\n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  support  MOH  and  the  provincial  departments  of  health  in  effectively \nimplementing  Decision  139,  and  improving  the  management  information  system  (MIS)  and \nsurveillance of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n31. \nEffective  implementation  of  Decision  139  poses  a  considerable  challenge  since  the \nproportion of poor in the Central Highlands is greater than any other region of the country. There \nare  about  1.7  million  people  in  the  region\u2014about  40%  of  the  Central  Highlands\u2019  total \npopulation\u2014eligible  for  subsidized  services.  Through  financing  from  Sida,  the  Project  will \ninstitutionalize  mechanisms  for  effective  monitoring,  supervision,  and  evaluation  of  both  the \nimplementation  and  impact  of  the  HCFP.  The  Project  will  also  finance  part  of  the  provincial \ncontribution  to  HCFP  based  on  criteria  determined  during  implementation.  The  Project  will \nsupport  development  of  an  information  system  to  monitor  the  use  of  services  at  both  the \nprovincial  and  national  levels.  At  the  provincial  level,  it  will  also  finance  regular  household \nsurveys to assess the impact on the use of services and out-of-pocket expenditures by the poor. \n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  document  and  disseminate  the  effectiveness  of  targeting  intended \nbeneficiaries and implementation experience through specially sponsored studies. Lessons from \nthe  Central  Highlands  will  be  useful  in  fine-tuning  the  implementation  of  Decision  139  in  the \nwhole country. The Project will also provide selected support for national implementation. \n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  MIS  in  the  four  provinces  with  a  view  to  strengthening \nsupervision and management of health services. Improved MIS will also provide critical, timely \ninformation about incidence and prevalence of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. \nThe Project will also support training at all levels to strengthen management. The focus at the \ncommune  and  district  levels  is  (i)  improving  supervision  of  technical  care,  (ii)  strengthening \nplanning and organization of care, and (iii) enhancing financial sustainability of facilities. \n \n34. \nThe Project will help strengthen the capacity of MOH and provincial health departments \nto implement the project by supporting a project management unit (PMU) and provincial project \nmanagement units (PPMUs). The Project will finance the necessary equipment and consulting \nservices required for effective implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of project activities. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  effect  and  will  improve \nconsiderably  current  waste  management  practices  (see  Appendix  4  for  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination). Most civil works will upgrade existing health facilities, rehabilitating \nstructures and replacing outdated equipment. The new civil works are small in scale and will not \nadversely  affect  any  ecosystems.  Design  of  civil  works  will  address  disposal  of  hazardous \nmedical  wastes.  A  major  component  is  to  improve  waste  management.  Given  the  potential \nenvironmental  and  health  hazards  from  medical  waste,  an  environment  management  plan \n(EMP),  including  a  waste  management  plan,  will  be  developed  for  each  district  health  center.  \nADB assisted the MOH in developing an outline of the EMP, which was endorsed by MOH. The \nProject  includes  provisions  for  upgrading  and  improving  waste  management  based  on  local \nconditions and existing practice. Alternative technologies for waste disposal have been carefully \nconsidered  and  investigated.  This  will  follow  the  draft  national  master  plan  for  medical  waste \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\nmanagement,10  which  discourages  the  use  of  incinerators  at  the  district  level.  Sufficient  funds \nhave been allocated to meet the cost of installing and/or upgrading medical waste systems. The \nProject will also support training for medical staff, including nurses, in proper waste separation, \nstorage,  and  disposal.  Steps  for  safe  medical  waste  management  will  follow  best  practice  for \nlow resource settings, based on World Health Organization recommendations and current MOH \npolicies and procedures. \n \n\nThe Project does not have any adverse social impacts. Some social issues the Project \n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n \n36. \naddresses include: \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty \n\n \n\n37. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  availability  and  appropriateness  of  quality  health  services, \nincrease user affordability and utilization of health services, and strengthen the capacity of the \npublic  health  system  in  the  central  highland  provinces.  During  project  preparation,  a  needs \nassessment was undertaken to identify (i) the existing burden of disease on the poor and ethnic \nminority groups, (ii) their ability to pay for proposed project services, (iii) strategies to optimize \ntheir  use  of  the  services,  (iv)  the  current  capacity  of  the  health  system  to  effectively  address \ntheir  health  needs,  and  (v)  cost-sharing  mechanisms  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the \nregional health system and improve the overall equity of health financing. Poverty issues have \nbeen  fully  incorporated  into  the  project  design  so  that  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  benefit \ndisproportionately. The Project will make a significant contribution to reducing the poverty and \nvulnerability  caused  by  poor  health.  In  1998,  3.4%  of  households  were  driven  into  extreme \npoverty  because  of  excessive  expenditure  on  health  care.  As  a  result  of  this  support, \napproximately  220,000  people  will  see  their  health  care  costs  drop  below  10%  of  total \nhousehold  expenditure.  This  pro-poor  health  financing  system  will  make  the  health  financing \nsubstantially less regressive (Appendix 5).  \n \n\nb. \n\nCommunity Participation \n\n \nA  successful  health  strategy  integrates  availability  of  services  with  public  participation. \n38. \nThe Project places a strong emphasis on community involvement and the use of services by all \ncommunity  members.  Past  experiences  from  community-based  health  education  and  training \nprograms  will  be  evaluated,  and  lessons  learned  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Project  where \nappropriate.  Morbidity  and  mortality  drop  dramatically  when  resources  respond  to  the  unique \nneeds  of  each  community.  Linkages  between  different  levels  of  the  health  system  will  be \nstrengthened  to  ensure  sustainability  of  initiatives.  Special  initiatives  will  be  taken  to  involve \npeople  in  health  insurance  schemes.  Women\u2019s  participation  will  be  central  to  programs  on \nmaternal and child health. Attitudes and knowledge of particular health issues will determine the \neffectiveness of services. The community will work more closely in assessing health needs and \nidentifying solutions. \n \nThe  provincial  health  departments  have  carried  out  initial  consultations  with  district \n39. \nauthorities  and  civil  society  on  the  proposed  civil  works  for  district  health  centers.  These \nconsultations included discussions on potential resettlement and environmental impacts, as well \nas the proposed design, to ensure that local needs are met. Additional public consultations will \n\n                                                 \n10  Ministry of Health.

Local  authorities  will  also  discuss  with \naffected  communities \ninitial \nenvironmental examinations. \n \n\nthe  site-specific  environmental  management  plans  and \n\nc. \n\nHIV/AIDS  \n\n \n40. \nHIV/AIDS poses a special threat to populations, especially ethnic minority groups, in the \nCentral Highlands. Current estimates show that 21 per 100,000 people in the Central Highlands \nare infected with the disease, compared to 56 per 100,000 nationwide. The populations in the \nCentral Highlands are relatively isolated from mainstream society, which offers some protection \nfrom  infection  but  also  impedes  education  and  prevention  programs.  For  ethnic  minorities  in \nparticular,  cultural  and  language  barriers  may  also  limit  access  to  materials  and  information, \nthereby increasing the risk of infection and vulnerability of marginalized populations. The Project \nwill help to strengthen current efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS through the preventive \nhealth  infrastructure  and  health  promotion  programs  specifically  targeted  at  HIV/AIDS. \nHIV/AIDS activities will be mainstreamed through training project staff and construction workers. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n \n41. \nThe  Project  fully  integrates  concerns  of  ethnic  minority  groups  into  subcomponent \ndesign  and  does  not  harm  any  specific  group.  The  Project  will  benefit  close  to  1.5  million \nmembers  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  four  central  highland  provinces.  An  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan  has  been  prepared  to  highlight  project  benefits  to  ethnic  minority \ncommunities, and ensure they have access to affordable, high-quality health services in a more \nequitable health system (Appendix 6).  \n \n\ne. \n \n\nGender \n\nThe  Project  fully  mainstreams  gender  concerns  into  its  design  to  ensure  that  women \n42. \nshare proportionately in project benefits. The Project aims to improve and raise the health status \nof about 2.2 million women, including 800,000 ethnic minority women. The Project emphasizes \nwomen\u2019s health, particularly in the areas of reproductive health, obstetrics, gynecological care, \nand maternal and child health. Improved access to reproductive health services will prevent half \nof the current maternal deaths per year by the end of the Project, and significantly increase the \nproportion of deliveries in the region receiving improved pre- and postnatal care. The Project will \nreduce the burden of disease for women, and help increase women\u2019s social contribution to their \nfamilies  and  communities.  A  gender  strategy  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  women  have \nincreased access to and utilization of affordable and high-quality health services (Appendix 7).  \n \n\nf. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n43. \nThe level of involuntary resettlement is significant. Land acquired for new and relocated \nhealth facilities will total about 15.2 hectares. Civil works will affect an estimated 38 households, \nincluding  shops,  which  will  require  relocation.  Some  affected  households  will  also  lose \nagricultural  land.  All  losses  will  be  compensated  at  full  replacement  cost  and  current  market \nvalue. Transition allowances will be provided and rehabilitation measures will ensure restoration \nof  income-generating  activities.  Affected  persons  have  been  informed  about  the  Project  and \nhave been consulted during preparation of the resettlement plan. Provisions have been included \nto help affected households restore living standards to pre-project levels or better. A summary \nof the land acquisition and resettlement is provided in Appendix 8, and the resettlement plan in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\f 10\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n44. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $30.6  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  SDR14.0  million  ($20  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special \nFunds resources, representing 65% of the total project cost and covering the major part of the \ncapital expenditures. The Government will provide counterpart funds of $5 million equivalent for \nrecurrent  costs  and  some  capital  expenditure.  The  Government  of  Sweden,  through  Sida,  will \njointly  cofinance  the  Project  through  grants  of  about  $5.6  million  equivalent  to  support  the \nimplementation of Decision 139 (Appendix 9). ADB will administer Sida\u2019s grant funds following \nits guidelines and procedures. \n \n45. \nADB will finance most project capital expenditure, including civil works, equipment, and \ntraining,  while  the  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  to  cover  some  implementation \ncosts,  capital,  and  recurrent  expenses  as  necessary.  Sida  financing  will  support  the  HCFP, \ncapacity  building  for  implementing  Decision  139,  and  consulting  services  for  health  financing \nand quality of care. \n \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates and Sources of Funds  \n($ million) \nProject Component \n\n \nItem \n \nADB \nSida \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nUpgrading Facilities and \nEquipment \n14.0 \n0.0 \n3.2 \n17.2 \n\nHuman Resources \nDevelopment \n4.2 \n0.0 \n0.9 \n5.1 \n\nManagement \nand Financing \n1.8 \n5.6 \n0.9 \n8.3 \n\n \n\nTotal \n \n20.0 \n5.6 \n5.0 \n30.6 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n46. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 65% of the total project cost (Table 3). The loan would cover $11.1 million \nof the foreign exchange cost (including interest on the loan) and $8.9 million equivalent, or 46% \nof local currency costs. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. It will bear an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter.  \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nADB \nSida \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n11.1 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n11.5 \n\nLocal  \nCost \n8.9 \n5.2 \n5.0 \n19.1 \n\nTotal  \nCost \n20.0 \n5.6 \n5.0 \n30.6 \n\n% \n\n65.4 \n18.2 \n16.4 \n100.0 \n\n \n47. \nFinancing  for  the  local  currency  cost  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing \npolicy.  Viet  Nam  needs  a  large  investment  program  to  support  the  health  sector.  The  need  to \ngenerate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  to  sustain  economic  growth  is  well \nrecognized.  However,  the  country  would  need  some  time  to  develop  the  resources  to  finance \nthe  required  investment  without  external  finance.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  a  large \ninvestment-savings  gap  will  continue,  hindering  poverty  reduction  and  human  development \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nprograms that have a large local currency component. A higher percentage of local financing for \nthis project is consistent with ADB policy. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n48.  MOH  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  Learning  from  the  experience  of \nearlier  projects  in  MOH,  implementation  arrangements  follow  a  partly  decentralized  approach. \nUnder this structure, the PPMUs will be the principal units for implementation in each province, \nand one national PMU will provide technical, coordination, and logistics support. Relevant MOH \ndepartments  will  actively  participate  in  implementing  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project. \nHuman resource development will be delegated to the Department of Science and Training, and \nstrengthening financing and management for Decision 139 will be delegated to the Department \nof  Planning  and  Finance.  The  PMU  will  monitor  physical  and  financial  progress  and  provide \ntechnical,  coordination,  and  logistics  support  to  the  PPMUs  and  departments  in  charge  of \nimplementation. The project management structure is in Appendix 10.  \n \n49.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be \nestablished. The PSC will be headed by the health minister, or a vice minister whom he or she \nauthorizes,  and  will  include  senior  officials  from  participating  ministries  and  institutions.  The \nPMU will work under the guidance of the PSC. The PMU, headed by a project director, will start \noperation  with \nincluding  planning,  accounting,  disbursement, \nprocurement,  and  contract  administration.  Additional  staff  will  be  assigned  depending  on  the \nworkload during implementation. \n \n50. \nThe  PPMUs,  with  assistance  from  the  PMU,  will  work  under  the  guidance  of  the \nprovincial  people\u2019s  committee  and  will  be  headed  by  the  director  of  provincial  health \ndepartment.  Each  PPMU  will  begin  operation  with  three  staff  for  planning,  accounting, \ndisbursement,  procurement,  and  contract  administration.  Staff \nto  organize  community \nparticipation and BCC activities will also ensure community-based implementation. \n \n\nfour  staff  with  expertise \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe Project will be implemented over an estimated 6-year period beginning 15 January \n\n \n51. \n2004 and ending 31 December 2009. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services \n\n \n52. \nAll  ADB  and  Sida-financed  procurement  and  consulting  services  will  follow  ADB \nguidelines.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  procurement  that  requires  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  and  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures,  and  (ii)  engagement  of \ninternational consultants. The PPMUs will be given responsibility for (i) procurement that follows \nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct  purchase  (DP);  (ii)  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants for each province; and (iii) implementation of provincial training programs; and (iv) \nother  local  procurement  following  the  division  of  work  and  implementation  regulations  as \nestablished  at \nfor  LCB  procurement, \nengagement of domestic consultants, and selection of training providers or institutes will follow \ngovernment  procedures  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Indicative  lists  of \nprocurement packages, consulting services requirements, and training programs are presented \nin Appendixes 12, 13, and 14, respectively.  \n\nthe  Project.  Procedures \n\nthe  commencement  of \n\n \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \n53. \nCivil  works  subprojects  will  be  small  and  scattered,  and  are  unlikely  to  attract  foreign \nbidders.  Civil  works  should  use  LCB  procedures  unless  they  exceed  $2  million  equivalent,  in \nwhich case ICB procedures will be followed.  \n \n\nb. \n \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\n54. \nThe  PMU  will  procure  medical  equipment  following  ICB  procedures  if  the  package \namount  exceeds  $500,000,  IS  procedures  if  below  $500,000,  LCB  procedures  if  below \n$200,000,  or  DP  if  below  $100,000.  The  PMU  and  PPMUs  will  procure  office  equipment  and \nvehicles  by  IS  or  DP  depending  on  the  amount  of  the  contract.  Office  furniture,  computers, \nmotorcycles, and bicycles will be purchased using LCB or DP. An indicative list of equipment to \nbe procured under the Project is in Appendix 15. \n \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n55. \nThe  Project  will  use  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  573 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Domestic  consulting  services  comprise  119 \nperson-months  for  services  organized  at  the  central  level  and  454  person-months  of  services \nspecific  to  provinces.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  from  consulting  firms  or  as  individuals  as \nneeded.  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  Domestic \nconsultants  for  provincial  services  will  be  engaged  by  the  individual  PPMUs.  The  PMU  and \nPPMUs may use contracted staff instead of or in addition to domestic consultants, depending on \nthe  organization  of  work.  International  consultants  comprise  an  architect,  an  equipment  and \nprocurement specialist, a public health expert with background in quality of care, and a health \neconomist. The PPMUs may engage contract staff or domestic consultants as needed to assist \nbuilding design, bidding, progress monitoring, and site supervision.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \nThe MOH will take advance action for procuring equipment, civil works, and consulting \n56. \nservices.  MOH  will  complete  approval  of  the  procurement  plan  for  the  PMU\u2019s  and  PPMUs\u2019 \nequipment  and  furniture  for  so  that  procurement  takes  place  immediately  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  MOH  will  also  prepare  a  shortlist  of  consultants  together  with  the  draft \nrequests of proposal and draft contracts for approval by ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Procedures \n\n \nDisbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  handbook. \n57. \nExpenditures valued at $100,000 or less will utilize the statement-of-expenditure procedure. An \nimprest account to facilitate payment under the ADB loan will be established at the central level \nwith  a  ceiling  of  $1  million  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  provide  advance  funds. \nSecond-generation  accounts  will  be  established  in  project  provinces  with  an  initial  ceiling  of \n$100,000 or 6 months\u2019 expenditure, whichever is less. It will be maintained according to the loan \ndisbursement handbook. Disbursement of Sida grant funds will follow similar procedures unless \nADB  and  Sida  agree  otherwise.  The  MOH  will  submit  separate  withdrawal  applications  for \ndisbursing Sida\u2019s grant funds. An imprest account for Sida funds may be established by mutual \nagreement. Such an account, if established, will be maintained separately from the ADB imprest \naccount.   \n\n\f13\n\n6. \n\nAccounts and Auditing \n\n \n58. \nThe  Government,  acting  through  MOH,  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts \nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan and Sida\u2019s \ngrant.  The  PMU  will  (i)  keep  project  accounts  separate  from  regular  accounts;  (ii)  separate \naccounts for the ADB loan and Sida\u2019s grant funds; (iii) ensure accounts and financial statements \nare audited annually, according to sound accounting principles, by external auditors acceptable \nto  ADB;  and  (iv)  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year, \ncertified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  the  auditor\u2019s  reports  and \nopinions, and management letter together with a report of actions taken by MOH to improve the \nfinancial management system based on the auditor\u2019s findings and recommendations. MOH will \nselect  and  appoint  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  within  sufficient  time  to  carry  out  its \nresponsibilities. Cost of auditing will be financed by the loan. \n \n\n7. \n\nReporting \n\n \n59.  MOH  will  submit  a  monthly  progress  report  to  ADB  until  the  loan  is  declared  effective. \nDuring  implementation,  the  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports.  The  reports  will  be \nprepared in the format provided in the project administration memorandum. It will summarize (i) \nprogress  made  against  established  targets,  including  aspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays,  problems \nencountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (iv)  a \nproposed  program  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected \nprogress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance and repair activities undertaken on \nthe health facilities. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on the execution of the Project, including \ncosts and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n8. \n\nMidterm Review of the Project \n\n \n60. \nThe Government, ADB, and Sida will jointly undertake a midterm review after 3 years of \nphysical  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  implementation \narrangements, and other relevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development strategies and \nthe  policy  framework  and  strategic  social  concerns  of  ADB;  (ii)  examine  progress  toward \nachieving the measurable objectives of the Project; (iii) identify changes since appraisal relating to \nsector issues, resource management, allocation, etc., and reassess their impact on future project \nimplementation  and  sustainability;  (iv)  assess  implementation  performance  against  appropriate \nprojections;  (v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify \nproblems and constraints; and (vii) formulate appropriate recommendations for corrective action.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation System \n\n \n61. \nThe Project has selected a short list of verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation. \nBaseline  values  for  these  indicators  will  be  estimated  using  data  from  the  Viet  Nam  National \nHealth Survey undertaken in 2001-02. Final values of the indicators will be estimated from data \nfrom a household survey planned at the end of the Project. Analysis of the verifiable indicators \nwill  be  disaggregated  by  province  and  district,  socioeconomic  status,  sex,  and  ethnicity.  The \nProject will monitor the environmental impact of the interventions by monitoring waste disposal \nand  by  checking  the  water  quality  of  randomly  selected  wells  near  Project-financed  health \ncenters.  Monitoring  of  resettlement  activities,  including  relocated  families,  will  also  be \nincorporated. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 14\n\n \n62.  MOH,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  consultant  team,  will  carry  out  the  midterm \nreview and a final evaluation. The loan will finance the evaluation cost. For the evaluation, the \nPMU will have overall responsibility for data collection, analysis, and reporting to all interested \nparties,  including  ADB.  Delivery  of  services  to  the  target  beneficiaries,  use  of  services,  and \nimpact of project activities will be monitored through regular reports and routine data collection \nduring the implementation period. Focus group discussion with beneficiaries will be carried out \nat the midterm review and at the end of the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n63. \nThe Project will have a significant impact on the health and well-being of the population \nin  the  Central  Highlands.  Since  health  is  closely  related  to  productivity,  it  will  also  have  an \nindirect impact on income. The Project will directly reduce poverty incidence by reducing out-of-\npocket  expenditure  on  health  by  the  poor  and  near-poor,  and  providing  financial  protection \nagainst catastrophic health conditions. The efficiency and productivity of the health sector in the \nregion will also be improved (see Appendix 16 for details).  \n \nImproved  Health  Status.  The  Project  will  benefit  4.4  million  people  in  the  Central \n64. \nHighlands through improved quality of, and access to, health services. These benefits will target \na  rural  population  of  3.2  million,  particularly  the  1  million  poorest  and  1.5  million  ethnic \nminorities. The Project will reduce the excess burden of disease in the Central Highlands and \nbring it in line with the national averages. It will also help the provinces achieve the health sector \ntargets set in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. The infant mortality \nrate will fall from 64 per 1,000 live births now to 40 per 1,000 live births in 2008, the maternal \nmortality  ratio  will  drop  from  170  per  100,000  live  births  to  110  per  100,000  live  births,  and \ncoverage of prenatal care will rise from 70% to 90%. \n \n65. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Increased  Equity.  The  Project  will  support  the  government\u2019s \ndecision to fully finance health insurance for the Central Highlands\u2019 poor, or to reimburse them \nfor  health  services.  This  will  reduce  out-of-pocket  expenses  on  health  care  and  free  up \nresources for other expenses such as food and housing. This pro-poor health financing will also \nmake  the  health  care  payment  less  regressive,  and  will  protect  the  poor  against  catastrophic \nhealth outcomes, a frequent cause of destitution and deep poverty. \n \n66. \nIncreased  Effectiveness  and  Efficiency  of  the  Health  System.  Improved  quality  of \nhealth care services, increased efficiency in health care delivery, and increased staff knowledge \nand skills will increase the overall efficiency of the health care system in the Central Highlands. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  health  system  in  the  four \nprovinces  with  the  measures  of  upgrading  health  facilities  and  preventive  health  centers, \nstrengthening  training  and  management  capacity,  and  increasing  the  quality  of  health  service \ndelivery. The district levels will emphasize improving of quality health care provision and service \ndelivery.  The  project  will  also  establish  appropriate  planning  and  management  procedures  at \nprovincial,  district,  and  commune  levels  with  trained  staff  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the \neffective and efficient health system. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n15\n\n67. \nThe  Project  has  few  technical  risks.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  health  system  is  well  established  and \nhas been quite successful in delivering both preventive and curative health services. Viet Nam \nhas shown it can manage a broad, decentralized health system that addresses the health needs \nof the population, including the poor and vulnerable. The Project will support technologies and \nprocedures that are well understood and tested both internationally and in Viet Nam.  \n \nThe Government has recently increased its investment in the Central Highlands\u2019 health \n68. \nsystem,  and  implementing  an  additional,  substantial  investment  program  may  pose  a  serious \nchallenge for the Government. The Project focuses on managing the health system at the local \nlevel  and  will  provide  adequate  support  for  training,  capacity  building,  and  management \nsystems.  It  will  also  take  steps  to  streamline  the  administrative  requirements  so  that \nimplementing agencies can focus on the technical details of the Project.  \n \n69. \nExternally  financed  projects  Viet  Nam,  including  those  with  ADB  financing,  have  often \nbeen  slow  to  meet  disbursement  and  procurement  targets.  Delays  in  approving  investment \nplans and finalizing documents have delayed disbursement and complicated project timetables. \nTo  reduce  this  risk,  the  Project  will  use  a  decentralized  structure  and  largely  eliminate  delays \nfrom  poor  coordination  between  national  and  provincial  governments.  The  implementation \nperiod  will  also  include  an  initial  phase  to  help  provinces  familiarize  themselves  with  ADB \nprocedures. This will allow for more realistic planning both by the Government and ADB. \n \n70. \nSustainability  is  a  major  issue  for  all  development  projects.  The  Project  will  focus  on \nthese \nbuilding \ninvestments  require  continued  government  support  to  ensure  that  the  health  system  does  not \nallow its investments to deteriorate. Adequate budget is needed for operation and maintenance, \nand  salaries  must  be  adequate  to  ensure  that  trained  employees  keep  their  positions.  The \nGovernment  must  also  provide  additional  medical  equipment,  training  material,  supplies,  and \ndrugs to ensure that project investments provide meaningful services. With careful planning, this \nis  not  likely  to  be  a  problem.  Government  spending  on  health  has  increased  substantially, \noutpacing  economic  growth.  Health  is  clearly  a  major  priority.  Economic  growth  has  also \ngenerated  additional  resources  for  households  and  local  governments.  Decision  139  will \ntransfer substantial resources to the health system, particularly in poor and remote areas.  \n \n\ninfrastructure,  supplying  equipment,  and  enhancing \n\ntraining.  However, \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n71. \nthe Government and MOH: \n \n\n(i) \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances will be required from \n\nImplementation  of  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  139.  The  provinces  will  have \nprovided health cards to all people eligible for assistance under Decision 139 in \nthe project area during the first year of loan effectiveness. The Government will \ncontinue to provide at least 75% of the contribution required for the HCFP. Within \n1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOH  will  have  established  detailed  guidelines  for \nimplementing Decision 139 to include accounting and auditing practices, as well \nas  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements.  After  3  years,  the  provinces  will \nundertake  a  review  of  the  implementation  of  Decision  139  in  terms  of  how \neffectively it gives the poor access to high-quality health care and how likely it is \n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n 16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto be sustainable. The findings of the review will be used to revise Decision 139 \nimplementation procedures, if necessary, during the last 2 years of the Project. \n\nEthnic minorities. The Government and MOH will ensure the implementation of \nthe ethnic minority development plan, prepared according to ADB guidelines, to \nincrease  the  quality  of  and  access  to  health  services  received  by  ethnic \nminorities.  The  Government  and  MOH  will  further  ensure  that  the  ethnic \nminorities have equitable opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, and \npromotion of health workers. \n\nGender strategy. The Government and MOH will ensure the implementation of \nthe  gender  strategy  prepared  during  appraisal.  They  will  further  ensure  that \npriority  will  be  given  to  women  in  selecting  participants  for  all  training  activities, \nwith a view to achieving at least the same proportion of women trainees as in the \noverall pool of the targeted staff. The ultimate goal is to reach gender equality in \nthe training, recruitment, and promotion of health workers. \n\nEnvironment.  MOH  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  location,  design, \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  health  facilities  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policy, as well as MOH policies and procedures on medical waste \nmanagement.  Each  district  health  center  will  prepare  an  EMP  for  approval  by \nMOH and ADB. For all major civil works, a site-specific environment examination \nwill  ensure  that  proper  mitigation  measures  are  mainstreamed.  Training  will  be \nprovided to relevant medical staff in medical waste management, including waste \nseparation and equipment operation. MOH will also ensure that the provinces will \nhave sufficient budget to operate and maintain the waste management plan. \n\nHIV/AIDS.  MOH  will  ensure  that  HIV/AIDS  activities  are  mainstreamed  in  the \nProject through the following measures: (a) project staff at central, provincial, and \ndistrict levels will be trained in knowledge and awareness of HIV/AIDS, as well as \nhow  to  plan  for  preventing  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  within  the  project  areas;  (b) \nconstruction workers in the Project will be educated in how to prevent HIV/AIDS; \n(c) relevant HIV/AIDS issues will be integrated in all training activities for health \ncare  providers;  and  (d)  HIV/AIDS  messages  will  be  integrated  in  the  BCC \nactivities supported by the Project. \n\nthe \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be \ncommitted  and  made  available  to  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  Approval  for  civil  works  contracts  will  be  given  after  the  required \nland  has  been  acquired  and  affected  households  have  been  relocated  and \ncompensated at full replacement costs. If any additional affected households are \nfound  during  implementation,  the  resettlement  plan  will  be  revised  to  include \nthem. Resettlement activities will be conducted in line with Vietnamese laws and \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the \nVietnamese  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement,  ADB\u2019s \npolicy will apply. \n\n(vii) \n\nIntegration  with  other  projects.  MOH  will  ensure  that  experiences  from  other \nrelevant projects are integrated in project implementation. In particular, MOH will \nevaluate the effectiveness of training programs being undertaken under the Sida-\n\n\f \n\n17\n\nsupported  Community-Based  Health  Development  Project.  The  findings  of  the \nevaluation will be discussed during the midterm review for potential integration in \nproject  activities.  A  similar  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  other  relevant \nprojects.  The  MOH  will  also  consider  the  use  of  manuals  on  financial \nadministration and project management developed following Decree 17.11 \n \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nCofinancing.

In the past 10 years, international support has averaged about $1,000,000 a year in \nGia  Lai  and  Dak  Lak,  $500,000  in  Kon  Tum,  and  $600,000  in  Lam  Dong.  Table  A2.1 \nsummarizes major international support to the region. \n \n2. \nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  National  Health  Support  Project  has  helped  three  provinces.  The \nproject  provided  support  to  all  districts  in  Gia  Lai  and  Kon  Tum,  with  substantial  support  to \ndistrict health centers, commune health centers, and intercommune polyclinics. The World Bank \nProject will also support 12 out of 17 districts in Dak Lak. The civil works support upgraded the \nsurgical,  emergency,  sterilization,  and  x-ray  units  of  the  district  health  centers.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and World Bank supported Dak Lak and Lam Dong through the Population \nand Family Health Project. Support covered fifteen districts in Dak Lak and seven in Lam Dong. \nThe  project  provided  civil  works  and  equipment  focused  on  strengthening  reproductive  health \nservices. \n \n3. \nAn  Australian  government  project  to  strengthen  health  services  provided  extensive \nsupport  to  provincial  health  services,  3  districts,  and  16  communes  in  Gia  Lai  province.  The \nprimary focus of the project is on maternal and childcare, providing support through equipment \nand training at the commune, district, and provincial levels. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF)  has  been  active  in  providing  support  to  primary  health  care  at  the  commune  level \nthrough  equipment,  training,  and  community-based  monitoring.  Germany  provided  major \nsupport to help establish Kon Tum's provincial hospital. \n \n4. \nAt  least  13  international  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  health  projects  in \nthe  Central  Highlands.  The  NGOs  are  supporting  17  projects  focused  on  the  following  main \nareas: primary health care and disease control. The projects are primarily in Lam Dong and Dak \nLak provinces.   \n\nTable A2.1: External Support to the Central Highlands \n\nOrganization \nWorld Bank \n\nProgram Name \n\nNational Health \nSupport Project  \n\nAsian Development \nBank and the World \nBank \n\nPopulation and \nFamily Health \nProject \n\nAustralian Agency for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n(AusAid) \n\nStrengthening \nRural Health \nServices \n\nLocation \n\nGia Lai, 12 districts \nKon Tum, 6 districts \nDak Lak, 12 districts \nDak Lak, 15 districts \nLam Dong, 7 districts \n\nGia Lai, districts of Kbang, \nAn Khe, Kong Chro \n\nDisease Control \nProject \nPrimary Care \n\nRegional \n\nDak Lak, all communes \n\nType of Support \n\n- Civil works, $140,000 per district \n- Equipment, $117,000 per district \n- Training modules \n- Civil works, $70,000 per district \n- Equipment, $30,000 per district \n- Training modules on quality of care, \nmanagement, and maintenance \n- Civil works focused on maternity \nblock, $70,000 per district \n- Equipment for maternal and child \nhealth, $30,000 per district \n- Training on quality of care and \nsupervision \n- Laboratory equipment \n- Support for disease control activities \n- Medical equipment \n\nPrimary Health \nCare \n\nGia Lai and Kon Tum, 3 \ndistricts \n\n- Equipment and community-based \nmonitoring, $240,000 total \n\nHospital Equipment  Kon Tum \n\n- Equipment for provincial hospital, \n$1,800,000 \n\nEuropean Union & \nJapan \nUnited Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF) \nUnited Nations \nChildren's Fund \n(UNICEF) \nGermany \n(Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau [KfW]) \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n21\n\nHEALTH IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS \n\nIntroduction  \n\nA. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  are  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  Viet  Nam.1  They  lag  behind \n1. \nnational  averages  in  terms  of  human  development,  measured  both  by  the  access  to  services \nand social sector outcomes. In the health sector, the Central Highlands have fallen behind other \nregions and will require substantial targeted investments to improve health outcomes, especially \nfor  the  poor.  This  appendix  reviews  health  outcomes  in  the  Central  Highlands,  utilization  of \nservices, and the health system.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nHealth outcomes in the Central Highlands are well below the national average because \nservice  quality  is  poor,  health  knowledge  is  limited,  and  utilization  of  services  is  infrequent. \nBurden of disease is a measure of the human cost of ill health measured in disability-adjusted \nlife  years.2  Table  A3.1  compares  burden  of  disease  estimates  and  other  key  health  outcomes \nbetween the Central Highlands and the country as a whole.  \n\nHealth Outcomes \n\n \nTable A3.1: Burden of Disease in the Central Highlands \n\nTotal DALYs \nlost per capita \n\n% of DALYs \nlost to CNPM \n\nMalaria Cases \nper 100,000 \n\nInfant \nMortality (per \n1,000 births) \n36.7 \n64.4 \n73.5 \n62.5 \n57.3 \n23.8 \n\n332 \n1,369 \n1,855 \n1,918 \n1,384 \n694 \n\nHIV Positive \nPersons per \n100,000 \n56 \n21 \n19 \n15 \n22 \n23 \n\nViet Nam \nCentral Highlands \n  Gia Lai \n  Kon Tum \n  Dak Lak \n  Lam Dong \n\n.18 \n.28 \n.30 \n.37 \n.27 \n.22 \n\n29 \n53 \n63 \n65 \n50 \n41 \n\nDALYs = disability-adjusted life  years, CNPM = communicable disease, nutrition problems, perinatal and \nmaternal conditions, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \nNote: DALYs are calculated per capita.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. Burden of disease is based on Viet Nam National Health Survey \n2001-02. Infant mortality is from the 1999 Population and Housing Census. Data on malaria and HIV is from 2001 \nofficial Ministry of Health Statistics.  \n\n \n3. \nTwo  important  facts  are  apparent.  First,  the  Central  Highlands  have  a  substantially \nhigher  burden  of  disease  than  the  national  average.  Second,  the  Central  Highlands  is  behind \nthe  rest  of  the  country  in  the  epidemiological  transition  with  the  majority  of  deaths  are  still  a \nresult of easily preventable health problems that have been largely controlled in other regions. \nAt a national level, burden of disease is slightly higher for men than women, but in the Central \nHighlands,  women  have  50%  higher  burden  of  disease  than  men.  This  is  largely  due  to \nreproductive health problems that can be addressed with low-cost interventions. \n \n4. \n The  infant  mortality  rate  (IMR)  is  often  used  as  an  overall  proxy  for  health  outcomes \nbecause infants are sensitive to preventable health problems. In the Central Highlands, the IMR \nis  64  per  1,000  live  births,  compared  to  37  for  all  of  Viet  Nam.  The  mortality  rate  for  children \nunder age 5 mirrors this trend. Analysis of the burden of disease data shows that children in the \n\n                                                 \n1   Using the General Statistic Office poverty line, 52% of the Central Highlands population was poor in 1998 compared to 37% at the \nnational level. Using the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs poverty line, poverty was 17% in 2002, compared to 13% at \nthe national level.   \n\n2   Disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  are  a  commonly  used  measurement  of  the  burden  disease.  They  estimate  the  number \n\nyears of life lost due to premature death or disability compared to the potential life expectancy.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nUtilization of Health Services \n\nCentral Highlands are vulnerable to communicable diseases, poor perinatal conditions, and are \nprobably weakened by malnutrition.  \n \n5. \nStatistics  on  specific  health  problems  tell  a  similar  story.  The  region  has  by  far  the \nhighest  rate  of  malaria  in  the  country.  Only  5%  of  Viet  Nam's  population  lives  in  the  Central \nHighlands, but the region accounts for 22% of total malaria cases. The region has a significantly \nlower rate of infection with HIV/AIDS3 and its isolation offers it some protection from the spread \nof this deadly disease. However knowledge of HIV/AIDS is also lower in the Central Highlands \nand  experience  shows  that  isolated  communities  can  be  at  particular  risk  from  rapid \ntransmission (main text, para. 40).   \n  \nC. \n \n6. \nA significant proportion of the Central Highlands population is not using existing health \nservices. The low demand for health care is the result of both economic and cultural barriers to \nservice. By many measures, the utilization of health services in the Central Highlands is below \nthe national average. At the primary level, contact rates are about half the national level. \n \n7. \nThe  contact  rate  for  hospitals  (primarily  district  health  centers)  is  closer  to  the  national \naverage. In the Central Highlands, the contact rate is 0.5, compared to the national rate of 0.7. \nDespite  the  fact  this  is  below  the  national  average,  it  suggests  that  residents  in  the  Central \nHighlands rely on district health centers as their first point of contact. This is likely to be due to \nthe  convenience  of  the  district  health  centers,  the  higher  quality  of  services,  and  the  fact  that \nmany patients avoid the health care system until they become very ill. Lower hospital utilization \nrates in the Central Highlands as a whole come as a result of infrequent use by the poor; the \nnon-poor have similar utilization patterns to their counterparts in the rest of the country.  \n \n\n \n\nTable A3.2: Utilization of Health Services in the Central Highlands \nNo health worker \nat delivery (%) \n\nReceived no \nprenatal care (%) \n\nContact rate for \nhospitals  \n\nViet Nam \nCentral Highlands \n  Gia Lai \n  Kon Tum \n  Dak Lak \n  Lam Dong \n\n17.9 \n37.9 \n62.7 \n34.2 \n33.7 \n21.6 \n\n17.6 \n40.4 \n63.3 \n39.6 \n45.4 \n62.5 \n\nTotal contact rate \nfor health \nservices \n0.7 \n0.5 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n 10.8 \n   7.2 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\nNote: Contact rates are not available at the provincial level.  \nSource: Staff calculations based on Viet Nam National Health Survey 2001-02.  \n\n \n8. \nThe population is less likely to utilize specialized health services such as hospital care \nand  reproductive  health  services.  For  example,  only  62%  pregnant  women  in  the  Central \nHighlands received antenatal care, compared to the national average of 82%. Likewise, 40% of \nwomen  said  their  most  recent  delivery  was  unattended.  This  is  more  than  double  the  national \naverage. Table A3.2 compares the use of health care services in the Central Highlands with the \nrest of Viet Nam.  \n \n9. \nEconomic  barriers.  Accessing  health  care  is  never  free  and  in  many  cases  the  cost \n(both  direct  costs  such  as  fees  for  services  and  medication  and  indirect  costs  such  as \ntransportation and opportunity cost of time spent seeking care) is more than many households \ncan  afford.  Participatory  poverty  analyses  have  shown  that  the  cost  of  health  care  is  a \n\n                                                 \n3  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23\n\nsignificant  barrier  for  the  poor.4  In  the  absence  of  a  well-established  insurance  system,  health \nexpenditures can be unpredictable and serious health problems can lead to impoverishment. An \nestimated  15%  of  households  in  the  Central  Highlands  spend  more  than  10%  of  their  annual \nhousehold budgets on health care. This is similar to the national proportion. On average, around \n6.3% of household expenditures are for health care in the Central Highlands compared to the \nnation average of 6.9%.  \n \n10. \nViet  Nam  is  in  the  process  of  expanding  targeted  health  insurance  for  the  poor.  The \nGovernment  is  currently  implementing  Prime  Minister's  Decision  139,5  which  will  establish \nHealth  Care  Funds  for  the  Poor  (HCFP),  reduce  vulnerability  of  the  poor,  and  increase  the \naffordability  of  health  care.  If  the  provinces  have  the  capacity  to  implement  Decision  139,  the \nCentral Highlands will benefit substantially. Under current regulations, the potential coverage of \nthe  HCFP  in  the  Central  Highlands  is  39%,  compared  to  24%  of  the  national  population. \nCoverage will range from 23% in Lam Dong to 51% in Kon Tum. Dak Lak will have the largest \nnumber of beneficiaries in the country, with more than 835,000 people eligible. \n \nInitial estimates show that introducing Decision 139 has led to a substantial increase in \n11. \nthe utilization of health services, particularly among the poor. For example, inpatient admissions \nin  Dak  Lak  increased  by  13%  in  the  first  6  months  in  2003  compared  to  the  same  period  in \n2002. The number of inpatient days increased by 42% in district health centers during the same \nperiod, indicating an unmet demand for hospital care.  \n \n12. \nCultural  Barriers.  Beyond  the  economic  barriers,  many  households  are  effectively \nalienated from the health care system for cultural reasons. Ethnic minorities account for 33% of \nthe  Central  Highlands  population,  compared  to  14%  at  the  national  level.  Many  ethnic \nminorities,  particularly  women  (who  are  typically  responsible  for  household  members  seeking \nhealth  services),  do  not  speak  Vietnamese.  Participatory  assessment  shows  that  ethnic \nminorities face language and cultural gaps in accessing health services. \n \n13. \nAt  present,  there  is  little  hard  data  on  the  ethnicity  of  health  providers.  Anecdotal \nevidence shows that some health providers are members of ethnic minority groups, particularly \nat the lower levels, but their representation is significantly below their share of the population. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nCoverage and Quality. The coverage of the health system in the Central Highlands is \ninadequate.  In  terms  of  quantity\u2014for  example,  the  number  of  commune  health  centers\u2014the \nregion  is  close  to  national  averages.  Surveys  show  that  the  type  and  quality  of  equipment  in \ncommune  health  centers  in  the  Central  Highlands  is  close  to  the  national  standards,  and  in \nsome cases, it even surpasses other regions. The problem appears to be quality of care. Low \npopulation density means that health services are further from residents than they are in other \nregions. Table A3.3 summarizes the coverage of public health services in the region.  \n \n\nThe Health System \n\n                                                 \n4   World Bank. 2000. Voices of the Poor.

An  assessment  of  intercommune  polyclinics  and  district \nhealth  centers  show  that  these  first  levels  of  referral  often  lack  basic  equipment  and  supplies \nand fall well short of Ministry of Health norms.  \n \nHealth staff is particularly important  in ensuring that equipment is properly used, drugs \n16. \nproperly  administrated,  and  protocols  followed.  However,  attracting  and  retaining  high  quality \nhealth staff in the Central Highlands, particularly in rural areas, is difficult. The Central Highlands \nhave  a  similar  proportion  of  doctors  to  the  rest  of  the  country,  but  they  tend  to  be  located  at \nmajor  hospitals.  The  number  of  other  health  personnel  in  the  region,  particularly  nurses  and \npharmacists, is significantly lower.  \n \n17.  While the number of medical personnel per capita is similar in the Central Highlands to \nthe national averages, the level of training of health personnel in the Central Highlands is below \nthe national average, in some cases far below. The Viet Nam National Health Survey (2001-02) \nshows,  for  example,  that  commune  health  centers  have  the  equipment  to  deal  with  routine \nmaternal cases but staff responses to hypothetical cases show that their level of training is well \nbelow the national average.  \n \n18. \nThe  opportunities  for  training  in  the  Central  Highlands  are  relatively  limited,  further \nlimiting the quality of health care. Even in remote regions, there is the need for some specialists \nin  keys  areas  such  as  anesthesia,  basic  surgery,  and  obstetric  care.  The  total  number  of \nspecialists per capita (with postgraduate training) is only one fourth the national average. Unlike \nthe rest of the country, this number has not increased in the past decade. Likewise, the number \nof university-trained nurses in the Central Highlands is about half of the national average. The \nnumber of assistant physicians, who often receive additional training and become physicians, is \nalso  low  at  4.5  per  10,000  compared  with  5.9  per  10,000  at  the  national  level.  This  limits  the \npool of training physicians.  \n \nHealth  System  Financing.  The  overall  financing  of  the  Central  Highlands\u2019  health \n19. \nsystem is inadequate. Despite having lower health outcomes than most regions in the country, \nthe  level  of  public  financing  is  average.  In  2001,  government  spending  on  health  care \nnationwide  was  D84,000  per  capita.  Public  spending  in  the  Central  Highlands  ranged  from \nD51,000  per  capita  in  Dak  Lak  to  D166,000  per  capita  in  Kon  Tum.  Although  this  is  slightly \nabove the national average, it does not correspond to the health care needs of the region.  \n \n20. \nHealth  financing  in  Viet  Nam  depends  largely  on  private  payments,  even  to  public \nproviders.  The  Central  Highlands  fall  significantly  behind  other  regions  in  terms  of  household \nexpenditures.  On  average  in  2001,  out-of-pocket  expenditures,  including  related  expenditures \nsuch  as  travel,  account  for  6.3%  of  total  household  expenditure  in  the  Central  Highlands, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n25\n\ncompared to the national average of 6.9%. However, incomes are below the national average \nso  the  private  payment  to  the  health  system  is  only  D150,000  per  capita  in  the  Central \nHighlands, compared to the national average of D193,000.  \n \nFigure  A3.1  shows  total  spending  on  health  care,  including  both  public  and  private \n21. \nspending, compared with IMR. The two bold lines represent the national averages for IMR and \nhealth  expenditure.  There  is  a  clear  relationship  between  spending  on  health  care  and  IMR. \nProvinces with lower spending on health care tend to have higher IMR. The top left quadrant, \nwith  higher-than-average  IMR  and  lower-than-average  health  spending,  includes  all  of  the \nprovinces  in  the  Central  Highlands  with  the  exception  of  Lam  Dong.  Public  spending  cannot \ncompensate for the low level of private spending on health.  \n \n\nFigure A3.1: Health Expenditure and Infant Mortality Rate \n\no Kon Tum \n\no Gia Lai\n\no\n\no\n\no \no \n\no \n\no\no\n\no Dac Lac\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\n\no\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\no\n\no\n\no\no\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no Lam Dong\no\n\no\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\n\no\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no \n\no \n\no \n\n80 \n\n70 \n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n80 \n\n160\n\n240\n\n320\n\n400\n\n480\n\n560 \n\nHealth Care Spending (D1,000) \n\n \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n22. \nDecision 139 will substantially increase health care spending in the region.

The  summary  initial \n1. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  is  based  on  field  visits  during  project  preparation,  review  of \nliterature and government guidelines, discussions with staff at implementing agencies and other \norganizations, and consultant reports.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  health  system  in  the  provinces  of  Dak  Lak,  Gia  Lai,  Kon \nTum, and Lam Dong. The Project supports the upgrading of facilities and equipment, training, a \nhealth information system, and implementation of Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP). The \nProject will improve the handling of medical waste in the Central Highlands region. The Project \nwill  safeguard  the  environment  and  mitigate  potential  negative  effect  by  upgrading  waste \nmanagement  facilities  to  meet  government  standards.  All  civil  works  will  include  capital \ninvestments to improve management of medical solid wastes, including infectious, clinical, and \ntoxic wastes, as well as nonhazardous domestic waste and wastewater.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe Central Highlands border on the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Cambodia, \nand are equivalent to about one-fifth of Viet Nam\u2019s total land area. The region is mountainous, \nwith  an  average  height  of  800-1,000  meters  above  sea  level.  The  region  experiences  severe \nshortages  of  water  in  the  dry  season  (January  to  May).  On  average,  only  50-70%  of  people \nhave access to clean water. Use of septic latrines is low. The economy is based on agriculture, \nwhich  accounts  for  around  70%  of  regional  gross  domestic  project  (GDP).  Residents  cultivate \nrice, corn, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and commercial crops such as rubber and coffee. Soil in \nthe Central Highlands is suitable for fruit trees and medicinal herbs.  \n \nD. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n \n1.  \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nCivil Works \n\nfacilities;  social  disease  centers; \n\n \n4. \nThe Project supports civil works to upgrade district health centers (DHCs) and provincial-\ninformation,  education,  and \nlevel  preventive  health \ncommunication (IEC) centers; and secondary medical schools. Most of these health facilities are \nlocated  in  urban  areas  and  on  plains  or  plateaus.  They  are  located  at  ground  level,  with \nreasonable potential for natural drainage. \n \n5. \nDistrict Health Centers. DHCs include inpatient, diagnostic, and treatment facilities, as \nwell as other clinical support facilities. A DHC is typically located in an urban area with access to \nexisting water and electricity supplies. The DHCs typically have four to six buildings in an area \nof about three hectares and produce 20 to 40 kilograms (kg) of medical waste per month. The \nProject supports civil works for 15 DHCs. This includes major construction (approximately 2,350 \nsquare meters [m2] each) of four DHCs in Iapa (Gia Lai), Ngoc Hoi (Kon Tum), and Lam Ha and \nDi Linh (Lam Dong). Nine DHCs will be upgraded with civil works of 1,000 m2 or less. Support \nfor improved solid waste disposal, as well as water and sanitation systems, will be provided for \nall of these DHCs. In addition, the Project will upgrade both solid waste disposal and water and \nsanitation systems in two DHCs that will not receive any other civil works. A budget of $105,000 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27\n\nhas  been  allocated  per  DHC  to  cover  the  costs  of  improving  solid  waste  management,  water, \nand sanitation systems.   \n\n \n\n6. \nProvincial  Preventive  Health  Center.  The  Project  will  support  civil  works  for  a  new \nprovincial preventative health center (2,000 m2) in Da Lat in Lam Dong province. Solid clinical \nwaste will be taken to the provincial hospital for disposal based on government standards. The \nprovincial preventive health center will be linked to the city\u2019s water and sanitation systems. \n \nSocial Disease Center. A social disease center (SDC) is a separate facility handling a \n7. \nrange  of  issues  pertaining  to  social  disease.  The  Project  will  support  for  SDCs  in  three \nprovinces, covering an area of 1,000m2 each in (i) Kon Tum (Kon Tum); (ii) Buon Ma Thuot (Dak \nLak); and (iii) Da Lat (Lam Dong). Solid clinical waste will be taken to nearby provincial hospitals \nfor disposal. The SDC will be linked to the city\u2019s water and sanitation system. The Project will \ntrain staff at SDCs to handle medical waste. \n \n8. \nInformation,  Education,  and  Communication  Center.  IEC  centers  are  small  office \nbuildings that may be separate facilities or part of larger health complexes. The Project supports \ncivil  works  (250m2  each)  for  three  IEC  centers.  The  IEC  centers  generate  no  medical  waste. \nThe centers will be linked to city water and sanitation systems.  \n \nSecondary Medical School. The Project supports civil works for two secondary medical \n9. \nschools (about 3,000 m2 each) in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces. The school in Gia Lai will be \nupgraded in a new location, while the one in Dak Lak will remain at its current site. Schools will \nbe built closer to the provincial hospitals where clinical training will be undertaken. The schools \ndo not generate medical waste and will be linked to city water and sanitation systems.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOther Project Components  \n\n \nAn  annual  3-day  training  course  on  waste  management  will  take  place  every  year  in \n10. \neach  DHC  to  improve  handling  of  medical  waste.  This  course  will  focus  on  proper  sorting, \nstoring,  and  disposal  of  potentially  hazard  waste,  as  well  as  instruction  on  government  policy. \nGiven its importance, it will be offered every year to reinforce lessons and update staff on the \nlatest  practices.  Additional  training  may  be  offered,  depending  on  the  project-supported  waste \nmanagement  equipment.  Other  project  components\u2014training,  management  supervision,  and \nhealth financing\u2014are expected to have no marginal impact on the environment.  \n \nE. \n \n\nAssessment and Recommendations  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n \n11.  Medical  solid  waste\u2014glassware,  syringes,  dressings,  bandages,  plasters,  plastic \nsyringes, and test swabs\u2014accounts for 10-15% of hospitals\u2019 solid waste. Most health facilities \nhave limited resources for waste disposal. Health providers generally know to sort and separate \nmedical waste from conventional waste; however, there are problems with storage and disposal \nof  hazardous  materials.  Medical  waste  is  usually  taken  to  landfill  sites  and  mixed  with  other \nwaste  or  burned  in  the  open  air.  Liquid  clinical  waste  is  discharged  without  proper  treatment, \nand health centers lack basic wastewater facilities. Challenges to effective waste management \ninclude  (i)  inappropriate  technology,  (ii)  lack  of  training  and  awareness  among  staff,  (iii) \ngeographical remoteness of health centers, and (iv) high cost of treatment systems. \n \n\n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) has increasingly recognized the importance of improving \n12. \nwaste  management  in  the  health  sector  and  that  the  proper  disposal  of  hazardous  medical \nwaste  is  essential  to  avoiding  adverse  environmental  and  health  impacts.  In  response  to  this \nchallenge,  MOH  has  developed  a  series  of  regulations  and  a  plan  to  improve  the  handling  of \nmedical  waste.  The  regulatory  framework  provides  clear  guidelines  for  proper  medical  waste \nmanagement and follows international practice.1 MOH is also in the process of finalizing a 10-\nyear master plan to improve medical waste management.2   \n \n\n2. \n\nRecommendations \n\nBecause project activities are decentralized and need to be flexible, the Government will \n\n \n13. \nundertake the following four steps as part of the environmental review framework:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFor  each  DHC,  the  Provincial  Health  Department  will  develop  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  focused  specifically  on  medical  waste  management \nbefore  it  awards  contracts  for  civil  works.  The  outline  of  this  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \nThe  EMP  will  be  submitted  to  MOH,  other  related  government  agencies,  and \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  and  concurrence.  ADB  will  ensure \nthat the EMP is consistent with ADB's environmental policy.   \nProvincial health departments will carry out site-specific IEEs based on a review \nof the EMP and local environmental conditions. The site-specific IEE will carefully \nexamine  the  environmental  consequences  of  the  proposed  investment  in  waste \nmanagement and will make further recommendations. For sites that use medical \nwaste  incinerators,  special  care  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  engineering \nspecifications minimize harmful environmental impact. The IEE will be developed \naccording \nidentify  potential \nenvironmental  impacts,  including  both  indirect  and  cumulative  effects,  and \nassess  their  significance;  (b)  evaluate  the  cost  effectiveness  of  the  proposed \nEMP;  and  (c)  develop  appropriate  environmental  monitoring  plans  to  ensure \ncompliance.  The  IEE  will  follow  government  regulations  on  medical  waste \nmanagement and will be reviewed by ADB before civil works are approved.  \n(iv)  Hold site-specific public consultations with potentially affected groups on the IEE \n\nto  ADB's  environmental  policy  and  will  (a) \n\nand the EMP before awarding civil works contracts. \n\n \n14. \nSolid  Waste  The  Project  will  emphasize  the  main  principles  of  medical  solid  waste \nmanagement:  minimizing  the  generation  of  solid  waste,  early  separation  of  hazardous  and \nnonhazardous waste at health facilities, safe storage of hazardous waste, and proper disposal. \nIt  will  support  continuous  management  training  for  health  care  staff  handling  waste  and \noperating  equipment.  The  Project  will  improve  the  current  management  of  infectious  and \nchemical  waste  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy.  The  Project  will  make  a  major \ncontribution  to  support  implementation  of  the  proposed  National  Master  Plan  for  Health  Care \nSolid Waste Treatment in the Central Highlands. \n \nEach DHC will develop a site-specific EMP that is consistent with national regulations on \n15. \nmedical  waste  and  with  the  Master  Plan  for  Health  Care  Solid  Waste  Treatment.  The  local \nwaste management will also require approval by ADB with appropriate public consultation. The \n\n                                                 \n1  These  principles  are  an  integral  part  of  Viet  Nam's  Regulation  on  Healthcare  Waste  Management,  Minister's  Decision  No. \n\n2  The  National  Master  Plan  for  Healthcare  Solid  Waste  Treatment.  The  Ministry  of  Health  plans  to  submit  this  master  plan  for \n\n2575/1999/Qd-BYT (27 August 1999).  \n\nGovernment approval before 31 December 2003.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nlocal EMP will identify the DHC's procedures for identifying and separating medical waste from \nother waste, guidelines for transportation and storage, and final disposal. It will identify the roles \nof  individual  staff  members  within  each  DHC  in  managing  medical  waste,  and  will  include  a \ntraining plan for key staff.  \n \n17. \nThe  summary  IEE  has  identified  four  broad  options  that  DHC  have  in  disposing  of \nhazardous  medical  waste:  (i)  transportation  of  medical  waste  for  disposal  at  an  approved  and \ndedicated  disposal  facility  such  as  a  provincial  hospital);  (ii)  permanent  burial  in  specially \ndesigned, secure landfills; (iii) sterilization using either chemicals or steam; and (iv) incineration \nusing an approved incinerator designed to mitigate hazardous emissions.3  \n \n18. \nThe  local  authorities  will  have  to  consider  several  factors  in  their  decision,  including \ncapital and operation costs, the quality of the road network (for the transportation to a dedicated \nsite), the availability of necessary inputs, ease of implementation, training required, and public \nopinion. There is no perfect solution to the problem of medical waste: all options require trade-\noffs and carry risks.  \n \n19. \nLiquid  Waste  The  Project  will  support  better  liquid  waste  management  at  each  DHC. \nTechnology  for  liquid  waste  disposal  will  vary  based  on  local  conditions  and  practices. \nDepending  on  the  type  of  waste  and  the  organisms  in  it,  risk  waste  will  be  inactivated  and \nrendered safe before final disposal. Liquid clinical waste normally comes from laboratories and \nutility rooms where chemical and active solutions are stored.  \n \nF. \n \n20. \nThe  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  be  responsible  for  meeting \nGovernment  and  ADB  environmental  standards.  To  ensure  compliance,  a  domestic \nenvironmental  specialist  (4  person-months)  will  provide  overall  technical  guidance  and  help \nprepare  detailed  civil  works  plans,  particularly  the  environmental  mitigation  component,  to \nensure that all relevant standards are met. \n \n21. \nThe key elements of this summary IEE and the proposed waste management plan are \nincluded as specific assurances in the loan agreement. This includes both the required actions \nin  the  waste  management  plan  and  financing  of  the  associated  recurrent  costs.  ADB  will  also \ninclude  a  specific  assurance  about  submitting  the  National  Master  Plan  for  Health  Care  Solid \nWaste Treatment to the Government for approval.  \n \n22.  Monitoring  will  be  mainstreamed,  with  each  PPMU  preparing  semiannual  updates  on \ncompliance  environmental  standards  as  part  of  regular  reporting.  The  midterm  review  will \nprovide a detailed investigation of project compliance with environmental standards.  \n \nG. \n \n23. \nPublic consultation will continue throughout the project and will play an important role in \ndesign  of  civil  works.  The  Government  will  provide  information  on  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nissues in a form and language suitable to the population. The environmental specialist will hold \nconsultations with relevant groups to explain the financial and nonfinancial costs and benefits of \nproposed measures to mitigate environmental harm caused by medical waste.  \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n                                                 \n3  Both sterilization and incineration require the subsequent use of a landfill; however, this option does not generally require special \n\nhandling or facilities.  \n\n \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nConclusion \n\n \nH. \n \n24. \nThe Project will help improve the environment by upgrading existing waste management \nfacilities  to  meet  Government  and  ADB  environmental  standards.  Both  new  and  upgraded \nfacilities  will  include  investment  to  improve  medical  solid  waste  management  and  wastewater \ndisposal.  Based  on  the  summary  IEE,  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the \nProject is not required. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n31\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \nThe  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Strategy  identifies  deepening  human \ncapital, including investment in health, as a key \npriority for poverty reduction \n\n \n\nYes \n\n \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?   \n \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement \nand  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nidentify  health  as  a  key  area \nfor \nGovernment  and  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) intervention.   \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam has achieved a high level of human development nationwide, but inequality in health status has increased \nfrom region to region. Improving the health status of the people, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in the Central \nHighlands  will  require  targeted  intervention  and  subsidies  to  increase  access  to  quality  health  services  by  lowering \ncosts.  The  public  health  system  faces  challenges  in  protecting  and  responding  to  the  health  needs  of  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged.  For  instance,  HIV/AIDSa  poses  a  special  risk  to  ethnic  minority  populations.  While  their  relative \nisolation  may  offer  some  protection  from  infection,  it  may  also  prevent  entry  of  programs  and  campaigns  aimed  at \neducation  and  prevention.  The  Central  Highlands  are  at  particular  risk  because  of  its  close  borders  and  trading \nactivities  with  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic.  The  Project  will  address  these  and  other \nconcerns  through  regional  investment  where  the  focus  will  be  on  four  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  Central \nHighlands:  Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Lam Dong. \nB. \n\nProposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \nThematic Areas: Human Development/Gender and Development \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nThe Project will improve the availability and appropriateness of quality health services, increase client affordability and \nutilization  of  health  services,  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  public  health  system  in  the  four  central  highland \nprovinces. From 1988 to 2002, poverty incidence for Viet Nam declined from 37% of the population to 29%, according \nto the international poverty line. However, in the Central Highlands, the poverty rate has remained constant at about \n52%. The Project will improve the health status of 4.4 million people. It will specifically target 3.2 million rural residents, \nincluding 1 million of the poorest and 1.5 million members of ethnic minorities.  \n \nThe poverty analysis includes a needs assessment that identifies (i) the existing burden of disease for the poor and \nethnic minorities; (ii) their ability to pay for proposed services supported by the Project; (iii) strategies to optimize their \nuse of the services; and (iv)  the current capacity  of the health system to  effectively address their health needs. The \nanalysis also establishes cost-sharing mechanisms to enhance the sustainability of the regional health system within \nthe broader preventive and curative health system, and to improve the overall equity of health financing. Investments \nthat will be made are pro-poor, whereby the poor and disadvantaged groups benefit disproportionately. As a result of \nthis  support,  household  budget  for  health  care  for  approximately  220,000  people  will  drop  below  10%  of  total \nexpenditure.  The  Project  reduces  risks  that  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  from  becoming  further  marginalized  by \nhelping to reduce their vulnerability to health-related shocks. \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis                                                                                                                             Yes \nParticipation strategy                                                                                                                             No \n\n \n\nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study.  The  study  helped  to  identify  key  project \nstakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways in which they affect project feasibility and success. Primary \nstakeholders include selected staff from Ministry of Health, including 11 different departments and 2 different groups; \npeople\u2019s  committees  at  different  levels;  representatives  from  the  poor  and  more  vulnerable  groups,  including  ethnic \nminorities; and resettlement-affected persons. Secondary stakeholders may include mass organizations, relevant line \nministries, and the Ministry of Health.  \n \nThe  analysis  identified  the  need  to  integrate  the  community,  especially  women,  into  the  project  cycle.  Success  in \nreducing morbidity and mortality cannot be achieved solely through availability of health services. Public participation \nand involvement are essential elements of the health system strategy. Priority will be given to community involvement \nat  all  levels  of  the  system,  with  increased  attention  to  more  direct  participation  in  managing  public  services.  Special \ninitiatives  will  be  taken  to  involve  people  in  community-based  health  insurance  schemes.  Community  support\u2014 \nespecially among the poor, disadvantaged, and ethnic minority groups\u2014will be required (i) to help identify families in \nneed and (ii) to ensure their accessibility to special care. Women\u2019s participation will be central to programs focusing on \nmaternal and child health. Attitudes toward and knowledge of a particular health issue will determine the effectiveness \nof  health  services.  Through  the  health  system,  the  community will  work  more  closely  in  assessing  needs  and \n\n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nidentifying effective solutions.  \n \nParticipation  has  been  mainstreamed  into  the  Project.  The  Project  will  places  a  strong  emphasis  on  community \nparticipation,  and  use  of  all  partners  in  the  community,  particularly  the  private  sector,  to  achieve  an  effective  and \nefficient response to the unique needs of each community. Past experiences from community-based health education \nand training programs will be evaluated, and lessons learned will be incorporated into the Project where appropriate. \nTo  ensure  the  sustainability  of  these  initiatives,  linkages  will  need  to  be  strengthened  and/or  built  between  different \nlevels in the system. Three key areas of community participation has been identified: (i) the health system needs to \nshow more relevance of their services to the community at the district and commune levels; (ii) the community\u2019s role at \nthe  district  and  commune  levels  needs  to  be  expanded  in  terms  of  technical  and  financial  aspects,  so  to  generate \nownership  and  involvement;  and  (iii)  measures  are  needed  to  promote  and  strengthen  community  involvement  in \nhealth  programs  and  services.  Sufficient  investment  will  be  made  to  improve  the  use  of  behavior  change \ncommunications  (BCC)  to  directly  improve  the  effectiveness  of  health  services,  especially  for  women,  whose  well-\nbeing and further involvement is pivotal to overall health of children and family. \nD.

It  has  been  developed  to \nensure  that  ethnic  minorities  have  access  to  affordable,  high-quality  services  in  a  more \nequitable health system in the four project provinces. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  4.4  million  people  in  the  region,  including  1.5  million \nmembers of ethnic minority groups. \u201cEthnic minority\u201d refers to groups different from the majority \nethnic  group,  the  Kinh.  The  Central  Highlands  are  equivalent  to  about  one-fifth  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ntotal land area, and are one of the areas of greatest ethnic diversity. Minority groups represent \nabout  14% of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total  population,  and  about  28%  of  the  total  poor.  About  33%  of  the \ntotal population in the Central Highlands are ethnic minorities: 43% in Gia Lai, 52% in Kon Tum, \n29% in Dak Lak, and 23% in Lam Dong. \n \n3. \nIn Viet Nam, a major challenge for the health system is to reduce the inequalities in the \nuse of health services (Table A6.1). The burden of disease amongst ethnic minorities is much \nhigher  than  that  amongst  majority  ethnic  groups.  Provinces  with  high  concentrations  of  ethnic \nminorities usually have  high infant and child mortality rates. Ethnic minorities are less likely to \nseek health care than the Kinh because of (i) high cost and low coverage of health insurance; \n(ii) poor quality of services in rural areas; (iii) little motivation/incentive for health care workers to \nserve the poor; (iv) geographical remoteness; (v) lack of gender-specific considerations; and (vi) \nlanguage  and  cultural  barriers.  Ethnic  minorities  have  not  been  able  to  capture  proportionate \nbenefits from health services for these reasons.  \n \n\nTable A6.1: Health Indicators for the Central Highlands \n \n\nIndicators \n\nViet \nNam \n\nCentral \nHighlands \n\nEthnic Minorities \nin the Central \nHighlands \n\n36.7 \n\nInfant Mortality Rate, Under 1 (per 1,000 live births, \n1999) \nChild Malnutrition Under Age 5 (%, 2000) \nMaternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000 live births, 1995) \nSupervised Delivery (%) \nHome Delivery (%) \nTetanus Toxoid Vaccination (%) \na 2001 estimates.  \nNote: All figures are from year 2001, unless otherwise indicated. \nSource: Project situational analysis, 2003.  \n \n \n\n33.8 \n95.0 \n82.4 \n23.3 \n87.1 \n\n64.4 \n\n40.9 \n 170.0a \n59.6 \n55.1 \n69.5 \n\n40.0 \n\n41.0 \n200-300 \n30.0 \n83.0 \n44.0 \n\nHIV/AIDS1 poses a special risk to ethnic minority populations (main text, para. 40). The \n4. \nrecent Viet Nam National Health Survey (2001-02) showed that about 86% of women who have \never married knew what HIV/AIDS is, as compared to the national average of 95%. The Central \nHighlands  are  at  particular  risk  of  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS  because  of  their  close  borders  and \nfrequent trade with Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe EMDP for the Project is based on Vietnamese laws and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  policy  on  indigenous  peoples  .  ADB  policy  aims  to  protect  ethnic  minorities  from  the \nadverse impacts of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from development \nprojects  and  programs.  The  Project  will  create  favorable  conditions  for  improved  access  to \nhealth services. This will enable ethnic minority families to seek timely and quality health care. \n \n6. \nThe Government recognizes ethnic minorities as poor and underprivileged groups. The \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  sets  11  goals,  7  of  which \ndeal directly with issues of gender and ethnic minorities: (i) achieve better education for all; (ii) \nreach gender equality and empower women; (iii) reduce infant and child mortality; (iv) improve \nmaternal health; (v) combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other communicable diseases; (vi) reduce \nvulnerability; and (vii) eradicate poverty and preserve ethnic minority culture.  \n \nA  recent  government  policy  initiative,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  139,2  is  designed  to \n7. \nensure  access  to  basic  health  care  for  the  poor.  The  policy  specifically  identifies  ethnic \nminorities in the Central Highlands as primary beneficiaries. Under Decision 139, the provincial \npeople\u2019s  committees  will  establish  Health  Care  Funds  for  the  Poor  to  subsidize  the  cost  of \nservices at public health facilities for targeted beneficiaries (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  fully  mainstreams  ethnic  minorities\u2019  concerns  into  its  design.  Specific \n8. \nactivities are incorporated into the designed health interventions to ensure that ethnic minorities \nshare  proportionately  in  project  benefits.  The  Project  aims  to  (i)  improve  and  raise  the  health \nstatus  of  ethnic  minority  families  by  improving  availability  of  and  accessibility  to  high-quality \nhealth  services;  (ii)  encourage  and  involve  the  participation  of  ethnic  minority  communities  in \nhealth  activities,  ensure  direct  benefits  to  ethnic  minority  communities  in  health  projects,  and \ncreate conditions for equitable and sustainable development; (iii) support the health system to \nimprove  and  increase  the  capability  to  provide  culturally-sensitive  health  services  and  meet \neffectively  the  health  needs  of  ethnic  minority  groups;  and  (iv)  continue  to  reduce  financial \nbarriers to services for ethnic minority communities.  \n \n9. \nSpecific  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minority  groups  benefit \nproportionately.  Specific  activities  to  increase  access  to  improved  health  services  for  ethnic \nminorities include:  \n(i) \n\nProject Benefits \n\nUpgrading  of  facilities  and  new  civil  works  will  provide  adequate  visual  and \nauditory privacy for patients, especially for 800,000 ethnic minority women.  \nPriority  will  be  given  to  health  topics  that  disproportionately  affect  ethnic \nminorities at project-financed facilities. \nHealth information materials will be more culturally compatible, the use of visual \nand  audio  aids  will  be  encouraged,  and  collaboration  with \nlocal  mass \norganizations, such as the Women\u2019s Union, will be sought.  \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  will  be  integrated  into  training  programs  in  a \nmanner that is culturally sensitive to ethnic minorities. \nFull  incorporation  of  special  ethnic  minority  needs  into  the  development  of  new \nmaterials through extensive consultation with ethnic minority groups.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n                                                 \n2  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on Health Care for the Poor. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35\n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCultural  training  for  health  personnel.

These include:  \n\nFocused  interventions  will  ensure  proportionate  ethnic  minority  representation  in  the \n\nMeasures  to  increase  and  retain  the  number  of  ethnic  minority  staff  by  (a) \nrecruiting more ethnic minority staff from the Central Highlands, and (b) capacity \nbuilding in health issues that disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. \nAdequate  opportunities  to  participate  in  training  courses  offered  though  the \nProject by relaxing entry standards for ethnic minorities.  \nThe following targets are specified for training courses financed by the Project: \n(a) \n\n50% of postgraduate degree places will be reserved for candidates from \nethnic minority groups.  \n40% of the places on short-term training courses will be reserved for field \nworkers from ethnic minority groups. \n20%  of  medical  doctors  who  receive  training  will  come  from  ethnic \nminority groups.  \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  costs  of  seeking  health  services  for  ethnic  minority \n11. \ncommunities  by  supporting  the  implementation  of  Decision  139.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  using \nsupplementing  government  funds  to  cover  ethnic  minority  families  in  the  region.  Capacity \nbuilding  to  implement  Decision  139  will  ensure  that  health  services  are  culturally  appropriate, \nand  that  health  information  materials  are  available  in  the  local  language.  A  monitoring  system \nwill work to ensure the collection of information disaggregated by ethnicity.  \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n12. \nImplementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  EMDP  have  been  integrated \ninto the overall arrangements and total budget of the Project as ethnic minorities are identified \nas primary beneficiaries. Each medical facility shall have at least one staff member aware of the \ntraditional  ethnic  minority  health  behaviors  and  practices.  The  provincial  project  management \nunit (PPMU) will have at least one member trained and able to manage specific ethnic minority \nissues.  A  domestic  social  development  specialist  will  be  hired  for  6  person-months  over  the \nperiod of the Project to help develop implementation guidelines for the EMDP. The specialist will \nwork closely with the health specialists for the Project.  \n \n13. \nThe  monitoring  of  the  EMDP  will  be  part  of  the  overall  system  for  the  Project.  Ethnic \nminority  beneficiaries  will  be  involved  in  designing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  health \nservices. The midterm review will pay special attention to ethnic minority groups, and progress \nreports will include updates on ethnic minorities, tracking any change in access and utilization of \nhealth  care.  Affordability  and  appropriateness  of  services  and  care  will  also  be  recorded. \nAdjustments, if necessary, will be made during the project to better meet ethnic minority needs. \n\n \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nGENDER STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  provides  significant  health  benefits  for  2.2  million  women  in  the  Central \n1. \nHighlands, including 800,000 ethnic minority women. Gender issues have been fully integrated \ninto the project design, with consideration given to gender-specific health concerns. The Project \nemphasizes  women\u2019s  health,  particularly  reproductive  health,  obstetrics,  gynecological  care, \nand  maternal  and  child  health.  Investments  made  in  women\u2019s  health  will  also  have  a  positive \nimpact on the welfare of the family and child. A gender strategy has been prepared to ensure \nthat  women  will  have  increased  access  to  and  utilization  of  affordable,  high-quality  health \nservices. The gender strategy is based on the situational analysis and assessment prepared for \nthe  Project,  and  in  accordance  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment.  \n \nB. \n\nBurden of Disease \n\n2. \nAbout  50%  of  the  population  in  the  Central  Highlands  is  female  and  disproportionately \nburdened by health problems. The burden of disease for females of reproductive age (15-44) is \nmore  than  200  disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)1  in  all  four  provinces,  compared  to  the \nnational average of 144 per 1,000 persons. In the Central Highlands, the burden is greater for \nwomen than for men whereas in the country as a whole, the burden of disease is similar for men \nand women. In Kon Tum, the figure is close to 230 DALYs (290 for women and 172 for men). \nThe  burden  of  disease  for  women  from  the  Central  Highlands  is  twice  that  of  the  average \nVietnamese woman from the same age group. For men of the same age group, the burden of \ndisease is slightly higher in the Central Highlands than Viet Nam. \n \n3. \nFor  women  in  the  Central  Highlands,  especially  ethnic  minority  women,  a  high  burden  of \ndisease is associated with (i) household poverty and poor living conditions; (ii) lack of knowledge, \nmaterials, and information about women\u2019s and children\u2019s health, and about the need to seek timely \nemergency care; (iii) a high birth rate; (iv) low social stature for women and limited ability to make \ndecisions; (v) differences in language and culture between health service users and providers; and \n(vi)  cost  of  health  services.  Although  there  is  little  concrete  data,  participatory  assessments  also \nindicate that gender-based violence is a major health concern for women.2 \n \n\n1. \n\nWomen\u2019s Health Seeking Behavior \n\n4. \nWomen\u2019s  health-seeking  behavior  and  fertility  decisions  are  influenced  by  crosscutting \nfactors  such  as  gender,  culture,  tradition,  ethnicity,  and  access.3  For  instance,  gynecological \nexaminations, prenatal visits, and delivery in the presence of a qualified medical worker are not \nconsidered important reproductive health practices. In 2000, about 65% of births in the Central \nHighlands  were  attended  by  a  trained  attendant,  compared  to  92%  nationwide.  About  45%  of \nwomen in the region received prenatal care in 2000, compared to 70% nationally.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Burden  of  disease  analysis  is  a  tool  that  enables  the  total  morbidity  and  mortality  of  a  community  to  be  expressed  as  one \nmeasure\u2014a  disability-adjusted  life  year  (DALY).  The  analysis  expresses  (i)  morbidity  in  terms  of  years  that  have  been  lost \nthrough disability due to contracting or living with a certain disease, and (ii) mortality in terms of years lost because of premature \ndeath from disease.  \n\n2   ADB. 2002. Women in Viet Nam: Country Briefing Paper.  \n3   ADB. 2001. A Study of the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\nMany women believe childbirth is a natural phenomenon and pay little attention to safe \n5. \nmotherhood care. A lack of awareness about safe motherhood practices, low education levels, \nand the absence of trained birth attendants during delivery to recognize and treat complications \nresult in high levels of maternal mortality. Maternal mortality among ethnic minority women may \nbe nearly three times higher than that for women from the dominant ethnic group, the Kinh. The \ngender  and  ethnicity  of  medical  staff  and  lack  of  privacy  at  health  centers  also  affect \nreproductive health practices, awareness about HIV/AIDS4, and use of contraception.5  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunity Cost of Seeking Health Services \n\n \n\n6. \nThe opportunity cost of seeking health care is high for the poor, and prevents them from \nutilizing  high-quality  health  care.6  Many  women  often  lack  control  over  household  income. \nInsufficient  time  and  money  limit  their  ability  to  make  timely  decisions  about  health  care  for \nthemselves  and  their  children.  Heavy  domestic  and  productive  workloads  also  prevent  poor \nwomen  from  seeking  early  health  care  and  treatment.  With  an  increase  in  economic \nopportunities, the opportunity cost of inactivity is too high for poor women, especially for ethnic \nminority  women.  Based  on  the  1992-1993  and  1997-1998  Viet  Nam  Living  Standard  Surveys, \npoor  pregnant  women  and  mothers  with  children  under  12  months  of  age  usually  work  longer \nhours in the labor market than their non-poor counterparts. Pregnant women and mothers with \nhigher incomes work less and have a greater ability to take time off to seek health services. For \nethnic minority women in the Central Highlands, opportunity costs are much higher.  \n \nC. \n \n\nGender and the Public Health Sector \n\n1. \n\nDivision of Labor \n\n \n\n7. \nMore than half of the labor force in the public health sector in the Central Highlands is \ncomprised of women, with the largest in Lam Dong at 63%. In Gia Lai and Kon Tum, about 59% \nof the labor force in the public health sector for each of the provinces are women. In Dak Lak, \nthe  estimate  is  60%.  The  gender  division  of  labor  within  the  public  health  sector  is  clearly \ndefined based on qualifications and professional skill. Female health workers usually have fewer \nqualifications, and work as nurses, midwives, or administrative staff. In Kon Tum, about 78% of \nuntrained  staff,  61%  of  those  with  lower  secondary  education,  and  67%  of  those  with  primary \nschool education are women. About 13% of health workers with postgraduate degrees and 26% \nof doctors are women.  \n \nFurther education and skills training are limited for female health workers because of (i) \n8. \nlong  distances  to  training  centers,  (ii)  high  costs  of  training,  (iii)  inability  to  pass  entry-level \nexaminations, and (iv) household duties and responsibilities. Female health workers often rely \non family assistance or preferential quotas to further their education and/or improve their skills. \nThere  are  few  incentives  for  female  health  workers,  especially  female  doctors  specialized  in \nobstetrics,  to  work  in  remote  health  facilities.  While  unmarried  women  worry  about  not  finding \nsuitable spouses in remote areas, married women are more concerned about the quality of life \nand education for their families in isolated areas.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n5   Population Council. 1999.

Of  the  17  district  health  centers  in  Kon  Tum,  only  2  have  female \ndirectors, and about 30% of departments and wards in Kon Tum have female deans/managers. \nThere are no women on the board of the Provincial Public Health Service.  \n \n10.  The primary health care committee (PHCC) is a multisector committee established in the \nprovincial  health  system.7  The  Women\u2019s  Union  is  one  of  its  members,  with  others  from  local \norganizations.  The  PHCC  advises  the  Provincial  People\u2019s  Committee  (PPC)  on  implementing, \nformulating,  organizing,  and  supervising  vertical  programs  and  health  plans  at  the  community \nlevel.  The  PHCC  helps  to  encourage  people\u2019s  participation  in  a  number  of  health  campaigns, \ncoordinates other sector activities in implementing health plans, and selects public information \nfor health subjects. The head of the PHCC is the vice chairman of the PPC, with the director of \nthe health center as deputy head. \n \nD. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n11. \nThe  Project  fully  mainstreams  gender  concerns  into  its  design  to  ensure  that  women \nshare  proportionately  in  project  benefits.  The  upgrading  of  facilities,  capacity  building  of  staff, \nand development of behavior change communication (BCC) materials will strengthen the health \ncare  capacity  to  better  respond  to  the  needs  of  women  and  understand  their  health-seeking \nbehavior.  Health  care  interventions  will  improve  the  health  status  of  women  by  removing \nbarriers to access, especially amongst ethnic minority women in the Central Highlands. Nearly 1 \nmillion  women  of  reproductive  age  reside  in  the  Central  Highlands.  Improved  access  to \nreproductive  health  services  will  prevent  half  of  the  current  maternal  deaths  per  year,  and  will \nincrease the proportion of deliveries with prenatal care. The Project will significantly reduce the \nburden  of  disease  for  women\u2014particularly  problems  nutrition  and  infection\u2014and  will  help \nincrease women\u2019s social contribution to their families and communities.  \n \n12. \n\nSpecific project activities include \n(i) \n\nUpgrading  facilities  and  building  new  ones  to  provide  adequate  visual  and \nauditory privacy for patients, especially ethnic minority women.  \nPrioritizing BCC and social disease topics that disproportionately affect women. \n\n(ii) \n(iii)  Health promotion that focus on the needs and knowledge of men and women in a \nmore culturally sensitive manner. The Project encourages visual and audio aids, \nand  collaborating  with  local  organizations  to  deliver  health  messages.  Project \nconstruction workers will be educated on how to prevent HIV/AIDS, for example. \n\n(iv)  Participation  and  consultation  with  women,  especially  from  ethnic  minority \n\ngroups, in the review and development of relevant health materials.  \nTraining  of  health  providers  to  recognize  local  knowledge,  and  understand \nhealth-seeking behaviors of women, especially from ethnic minority groups. This \nincludes  understanding  the  use  of  traditional  medicine  and  treatments,  local \nreproductive health behaviors, and safe motherhood practices. \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n13.  Within  the  public  health  sector,  the  division  of  labor  is  clearly  defined.  Leadership  and \ninstitutional  capacity  of  women  in  managerial  positions  is  limited.  The  Project  will  support \nmedical  training  opportunities  for  women,  including  ethnic  minority  women,  in  the  Central \n\n                                                 \n7   Government  Decree  No.  163  (1988)  instructs  that  all  levels  of  government  consult  with  the  Women\u2019s  Union  regarding  issues \n\nconcerning women and children. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nHighlands.  Such  interventions  will  ensure  their  representation  in  training  courses  for  skills \ndevelopment, and prevent them from becoming further marginalized in the health care system.  \n \n14. \n\nSpecific project activities include: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMeasures  to  increase  the  numbers  of  female  medical  staff  involving  (a)  the \nrecruitment  of  more  women,  especially  ethnic  minorities  from  the  Central \nHighlands; and (b) capacity building in gender-specific health areas. \nIn  provinces  where  the  PPC  has  established  a  PHCC,  at  least  33%  of  its \nmembers  will  be  women  and  should  have  an  understanding  of  women\u2019s  health \nand/or  ethnic  groups  health  concerns.  Greater  participation  by  the  Women\u2019s \nUnion will be encouraged. \nOpportunity for women to participate in training courses supported by the Project:  \n(a)  At least 33% of females, or a proportion equivalent to the number of female \nstaff currently employed at health centers, will be encouraged to participate in \nshort-term training courses. \n\n(b)  Preference  for  training  courses  at  provincial  secondary  medical  schools  will \n\nbe given to female applicants, especially from ethnic minority groups.   \n\n(c)  At least 20% of trained medical doctors will be women. \n\n \n15. \nThe  Project  will  also  reduce  the  costs  of  seeking  health  care  by  supporting  the  health \ncare fund for the poor in the Central Highlands. The Project will support implementation of Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decision 139,8 which will significantly increase the affordability of health services for \nthe poor in the Central Highlands. Capacity building to implement Decision 139 will ensure that \nhealth  services  are  culturally  compatible,  and  that  BCC  materials  on  women\u2019s  health  topics, \nincluding gender-based violence, are available in the local language \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe gender strategy, including its monitoring and evaluation, is fully incorporated into all \n16. \nproject components. Implementation arrangements, including estimated costs for activities and \ncivil works of the gender strategy, are in line with arrangements for the rest of the project. Each \nmedical  facility  will  have  at  least  one  staff  member  trained  in  women\u2019s  health.  The  provincial \nproject  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  have  at  least  one  female  member  trained  in  managing \ngender-specific  issues,  who  may  be  a  representative  from  the  provincial  Women\u2019s  Union. \nGender capacity building will be provided to project implementation staff as needed. A domestic \nsocial  development  specialist  will  be  recruited  for  6  person-months  to  help  develop \nimplementation guidelines for the gender strategy.  \n \n17. \nIn  monitoring  the  gender  strategy,  special  attention  will  be  given  to  involving  female \nbeneficiaries  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  health  services.  Sex-disaggregated  data\u2014\nand,  where  possible,  data  disaggregated  by  ethnic  minority\u2014will  be  included  in  the  reporting \nsystem.  The  midterm  review  will  consider  the  gender-specific  challenges  and  concerns  in \naccessing  appropriate  health  services.  Progress  reports  will  include  a  section  on  gender, \nhighlighting  any  changes  in  access  and  utilization  of  health  care  by  women  and  men.  The \nsection might also include observations on quality of training and appropriateness of equipment \nto women and men, especially from ethnic minority groups. Issues pertaining to affordability and \nappropriateness  of  health  services,  as  well  as  care  rendered,  will  be  recorded  and  included \nwhere  appropriate.  Necessary  adjustments  will  be  made  during  the  project  to  better  meet \ngender needs and promote the empowerment of women. \n\n                                                 \n8 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on Health Care for the Poor. \n\n \n\n\f40\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSUMMARY OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  finance  24  civil  works  subprojects  on  new  and  old  sites.  Four  civil  works \n1. \nsubprojects will require land acquisition and resettlement. One resettlement plan has been prepared \nfor the  Project to safeguard the estimated 38 affected  households, or  approximately  200 persons \n(Supplementary Appendix A). Provisions have been included in the resettlement plan to help restore \nliving standards to preproject levels, if not better. As detailed designs are finalized and approved, the \nMinistry of Health (MOH) and provincial authorities will revise and update the resettlement plan. All \nhouseholds will be compensated at full replacement cost and current market value. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAn estimated 15.2 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired for the different subcomponents \n(Table A8.1). About 38 households will be affected, as well as some shops, all of which will be \nrelocated to nearby land. Some households will also lose agricultural land.  \n \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impact \n\nProject \nTown \n\nTable A8.1: Assessment of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nNo. and Location of Civil Works \n\nConstruction at \nNew Site \n\nConstruction \nat Current \nSite \n\nEstimated \nLand \nAcquisition \n(ha) \n\nTotal \n\nEstimated \nTotal Impact \n\nNo. of \nAffected \nPersons \n\n2 \n1 \n0 \n1 \n4 \n\n7 \n5 \n8 \n4 \n24 \n\n5 \n4 \n8 \n3 \n20 \n\n80 \n15 \n0 \n105 \n200 \n\n7.8 \n2.4 \n0.0 \n5.0 \n15.2 \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\nGia Lai \nKon Tum \nDak Lak \nLam Dong \nTotal \nHa = hectares, HHs = households, and no = number. \nSource: Project situation analysis, field visits, confirmation faxes from project towns. \n \nC. \n \nThe legal framework governing compensation and resettlement is based on Vietnamese \n3. \nlaws  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  dated  1995.  Key \nVietnamese  laws  include  the  1993  Land  Law  (14  July  1993,  amended  2  December  1998), \nDecree  No.  22/1998/ND-CP  (24  April  1998),  and  provincial  decisions  that  guide  the \nimplementation of Decree No. 22. The 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration \nlaw, giving people access to land through user rights similar to private ownership. Decree No. \n22  regulates  compensation  for  land  the  Government  recovers  for  defense,  security,  national, \nand  public  interests.  The  policies  and  principles  adopted  for  the  Project  supersede  the \nprovisions  of  relevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists  between \nADB policy and Vietnamese law. The Project will be bound by these principles and conditions. \n \n4. \nThe basic principles and approaches of ADB policy include (i) an effort to minimize land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; (ii) arrangements for compensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation; (iii) community participation, and full information for and consultation with affected \npersons  on  resettlement  and  compensation  options;  (iv)  fair  compensation  for  all  affected \npersons on losses, including assets and incomes; (v) resettlement planning and implementation \nintegral to project design; (vi) special measures to protect socially and economically vulnerable \ngroups;  (vii)  adequate  support  for  affected  persons  in  obtaining  replacement  land  and  income \n\nNo. of \nAffected \nHHs \n15 \n3 \n0 \n20 \n38 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41\n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\nCompensation and Entitlements \n\nrestoration;  (viii)  effective  grievance  procedures;  and  (ix)  joint  monitoring  of  resettlement \nactivities by both the Government and ADB. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe principles and objectives ensure that all affected persons are compensated for their \nlosses in such a way to help them improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards \nand  income-earning  capacity.  Affected  persons  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation, \nregardless of formal land title. Illegal households are not entitled to land compensation, but they \nare eligible for compensation for any investments made in the land. Those who encroach into the \nproposed area after the cut-off date (or completion of inventory of loss survey for each individual \ntown)1 are not entitled to compensation or rehabilitation. \n \n6. \nAffected persons are entitled compensation for lost assets, incomes, and businesses at \nfull  replacement  cost  at  current  market  value,  free  from  taxes,  registration,  and  land  transfer. \nCompensation  will  be  land-based  where  possible.  Any  investments  on  the  residential  land, \nincluding trees and crops, will be compensated at replacement costs at current market value. If \naffected  households  are  severely  affected,2  they  will  be  provided  with  transition  allowances \n(including  subsistence,  transportation  costs,  business  assistance,  incentive  bonuses,  and \nspecial support for poor households). Rehabilitation measures will also be included to improve \nor at least maintain their pre-project living standards, incomes, and productive capacity.  \n \nE. \n \nGia  Lai.  Civil  works  in  Gia  Lai  will  require  acquisition  of  7.8  ha  of  land  and  will  affect \n7. \napproximately  15  households.  Approximately  10  households,  including  some  shops,  will  be \nrelocated because the secondary medical school will move to a new site. About five households \nwill lose their agricultural landholdings because of construction of a district health center in Iapa \ndistrict.  Compensation  will  be  provided  in  land  or  cash  for  affected  households.  Resettlement \nsites have been identified and proposed.  \n \n8. \nKon  Tum.  The  civil  works  in  Kon  Tum  province  will  acquire  2.4  ha  of  land  for  new \nconstruction. The new district health center in Ngoc Hoi will be relocated closer to the border of \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  An  estimated  3  households  will  be \naffected by the land acquisition.  \n \nDak  Lak.  No  land  will  be  acquired  to  build  provincial  or  district  health  facilities.  If  any \n9. \nland acquisition or resettlement is found necessary during implementation, a resettlement plan \nwill be prepared before affected persons or households are moved. \n \nLam  Dong.  The  Di  Linh  district  health  center  will  acquire  5  ha  from  a  district \n10. \ngovernment-owned  commercial  plantation,  and  will  cause  the  relocation  of  20  farming \nhouseholds. These households are employed by the plantation, and live in old dwellings: about \n11 households have individual houses, and 9 households live in an apartment block. They will \nbe relocated to government housing, and will be provided compensation for their losses at full \nreplacement costs, including compensation for any investments made on the residential land.  \n                                                 \n1   Inventory of losses was completed for Gia Lai on 10 October 2003, for Kon Tum on 8 October 2003, and for Lam \n\nDong on 7 October 2003. \n\n2   Severely  affected  persons  include  (i)  those  physically  displaced,  and/or  (ii)  those  losing  more  than  10%  of  their \n\nproductive income-generating assets (agricultural landholdings or income sources). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42\n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nVulnerable Groups \n\nBudget and Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nF. \n \n11. \nAdditional  support  is  advised  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  female-headed \nhouseholds  and  ethnic  minorities,  in  terms  of  cash,  labor,  and  technical  advice.  Current \nresettlement estimates do not include any ethnic minority households.  \n \nG. \n \n12. \nThe current estimated cost of resettlement for the Project is $240,109. Adequate budgetary \nsupport  has been  committed  and  will  be  made  available  by  the  provincial  or  district  authorities to \ncover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed  implementation  period.  A \nresettlement plan has been prepared, including a breakdown for each type of loss with estimates of \nunit replacement cost at current market value. \n \n13. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health  and  provincial  and  district  authorities  will  be  required  to  update \nthe  resettlement  plan  as  civil  works  are  finalized,  or  if  any  civil  works  if  found  to  cause \nresettlement  during  implementation.  The  Ministry  of  Health  is  responsible  for  approving  the \noverall resettlement plan, while the project management unit will be responsible for coordinating \nresettlement policies. The provincial project management unit (PPMU) will ensure coordination \nof provincial and/or district agencies involved in resettlement, reviewing compensation rates and \nthe resettlement budget. Resettlement committees at the provincial and district levels have been \nestablished to assist the PPMU in implementing resettlement activities.  \n \nImplementation  arrangements  for  resettlement  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works \n14. \nschedule for the health facilities. Approval to award civil works contracts will not be given until \nthe  required  lands  have  been  fully  acquired  and  affected  households  are  appropriately \ncompensated,  relocated,  and  rehabilitation  provisions  are  set  in  place.  A  domestic  social \ndevelopment  specialist  will  be  fielded  for  6  person-months  to  provide  technical  assistance  to \nlocal administrative authorities in updating the resettlement plan and ensuring that resettlement \nactivities meet Vietnamese and ADB regulations on involuntary resettlement. \n \nH. \n \n15. \nAffected  persons  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  ability  to  express  grievances  during \nthe  consultation  and  compensation  processes.  Grievances  may  be  expressed  verbally  or  in \nwriting during the consultation and compensation periods to the concerned local administrative \nofficials  and/or  the  resettlement  committees.  All  grievances  shall  be  settled  within  15  days. \nAffected persons will be exempted from all associated taxes, administrative, and legal fees. \n \nI. \n \n16.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  activities  will  be incorporated  into  the  overall \nproject arrangements, as the amount of resettlement is expected to be minimal. PPMUs will be \nresponsible for the internal monitoring of resettlement activities within their respective provinces. \nThe  domestic  social  development  specialist  will  help  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement \nactivities,  and  will  provide  an  independent  assessment  of  overall  resettlement  implementation. \nThe PPMU will prepare a monitoring report on the implementation progress of the resettlement \nplan  twice  a  year,  which  will  be  part  of  the  regular  project  progress  reports  to  the  ADB.  The \nmidterm  review  will  evaluate  the  resettlement,  and  include  a  section  on  resettlement  in  the \nprogress reports. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Procedures \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES BY COMPONENT AND FINANCING SOURCE \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADB \n\nFX \n\nLC \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nGov\u2019t\n\nTotal \nCost \n\nSida \n\nTOTAL \n\nFX \n\nLC \n\nFX \n\nLC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  2.1: Quality of Care \n\n137   1,836  \n\n1,973  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Component \n   \nA.

rationale  for  the  Project  and  quantifies  its \n1. \neconomic  contribution  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Central  Highlands.  The  appendix  also  assesses  the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe economic rationale for the Project's support for increased investment in the health \nsector  of  the  Central  Highlands  is  strong.  The  region  is  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  the \ncountry.  The  region  is  increasingly  falling  behind  in  terms  of  human  capital,  health  status  and \naccess to health services.1 The Project will help improve the equity and efficiency of the health \ncare system in the region, thus contributing to improved prospects for growth, quality of life, and \npoverty reduction.  \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  improving  the  health  status  of  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  and  on  increasing  the  equity  and  efficiency  of  health  system.  In  addition  to \nimproving the welfare of the population, investing in health helps significantly in achieving other \ndevelopment objectives. Health inequality often creates intergenerational poverty traps, a well-\nunderstood phenomenon. The effects of health and health inequality on economic growth have \nalso received growing attention.2  \n\n \nThe  low  demand  for  health  services  is  the  most  serious  constraint  to  improving  the \n4. \nhealth  status  in  the  Central  Highlands  region.  This  is  because  of  high  economic  and  social \nbarriers to health care. The Project will improve both the level and the equity of access to health \ncare by reducing economic and social barriers, improving the quality of health service delivery, \nand  strengthening  health  financing.  To  reduce  economic  barriers,  the  Project  will  support  the \nimplementation and management of the Government\u2019s Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP). \nIn the first year of HCFP implementation, the demand for health care at all levels has increased \nnoticeably. The Project will also reduce social barriers to health care by strengthening the health \nsystem\u2019s  information,  education,  and  communication  capacity  to  reach  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities,  and  women.  The  Project  will  train  new  and  existing  staff  to  ensure  that  ethnic \nminorities and women are well represented and that staff is sensitive to community needs. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  face  significant  supply  constraints.  Its  health  system  is \n5. \ncharacterized  by  poor  quality  health  facilities  and  equipment,  poorly  trained  staff,  and  limited \nmanagement  capacity.  Upgrading  existing  district  health  centers  in  remote  areas  will  directly \nand  significantly  impact  the  quality  of  health  services  available  to  the  poor.  The  increase  of \nhealth care demand as a result of the HCFP will tax the existing capacity of the health system. \nStrengthening preventative health centers and social disease centers will improve the capacity \nof  the  health  system  to  respond  to  priority  public  health  concerns  of  the  poor.  Knowledge \nmanagement  and  capacity  building  for  staff  will  enhance  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  health \nservices.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  comprehensive  health  sector  planning  and \nmanagement for the health system in the Central Highlands.   \n\n                                                 \n1   I.

The  Project  will  substantially  increase  the \naccess  of  the  poor  to  the  health  system  and  reduce  the  inequality  of  access.  In  Viet  Nam, \nhouseholds have to pay for health care. This accounts for 6.3% of total households expenditure \nin  the  Central  Highlands,  compared  to  6.9%  at  the  national  level.  However,  given  the  low \nincome  of  households in  the  region  and  the  high  cost  of  health  care  there  (due  to the  greater \ndistances  and  higher  cost  to  attract  qualified  personnel),  aggregate  health  financing  is \nsubstantially  below  the  national  average.  Using  2001  figures,  total  spending  in  the  Central \nHighlands  for  health  care  (government  financing  and  household  out-of-pocket  expenditures) \naverage D227,000 per year compared to the national average of D289,000.  \n \nUnder  Prime  Minister's  Decision  139,3  HCFP  will  cover  health  care  for  more  than \n7. \n1,700,000 people, approximately 40% of the region's population. This includes all of the region's \npoor  (as  defined  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs),  ethnic  minorities,  and \nthose  living  in  difficult  and  remote  communes.  It  will  substantially  reduce  the  share  of  income \nthat the poor have to pay for health care and increase resources for health system. It will also \nsubstantially increase use of health services, particularly at the district level. In the first year of \nHCFP\u2019s  operation,  this  trend  is  already  clear.    Dak  Lak,  Gia  Lai,  and  Kon  Tum  provinces  all \nhave health insurance coverage below 10%, while Lam Dong is at the national average of 16%.  \n \n8. \nThe  Project  will  help  the  country  reduce  inequities  in  use  of  health  services.  The \nKakwani  index4  measures  the  progressivity  of  public  subsidies  by  comparing  the  benefit \nincidence  of  government  programs  to  the  overall  distribution  of  income.  A  positive  value \nindicates  that  the  program  is  progressive;  a  negative  value  indicates  that  the  program  is \nregressive.  Before  the  Project,  the  Kakwani  index  for  health  spending  is  -0.2,  indicating  a \nregressive  health  system.  After  the  Project  is  implemented,  with  the  extra  resources  available \nfrom the HCFP and a small drop in price of services due to the added investment, the Kakwani \nindex  is  estimated  at  0.  This  indicates  that  the  health  system  is  no  longer  regressive.  Figure \nA16.1 shows the distribution of the health care expenditure before and after the Project.  \n \nThe HCFP\u2019s increase in resources for the poor will increase demand for health services, \n9. \nparticularly at the district level. Estimates show that the demand for hospitalization among the \npoor could increase by two to three times when insurance is introduced. To meet this expected \nincrease in demand, the Project will support the four provinces by training about 900 staff at the \ndistrict level. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the Central Highlands provinces to train \nnew health care personnel and provide refresher costs to existing staff. This will help the health \nsystem accommodate the projected new demand from the HCFP.  \n\n                                                 \n3   Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg, dated 15 October 2002. \n4   N.

Illness  and  disease  are  difficult  to  predict  and  can  drive  a \nhousehold  deep  into  poverty.  A  catastrophic  health  shock  can  devastate  a  household's  living \nstandards,  as  the  household  is  forced  to  sell  productive  assets  and  borrow  to  pay  for  health \nservices. At the same time, the affected individual may not be able to work or contribute to the \nhousehold's income. This double shock is well documented in Viet Nam.5 Estimates show that \n3.4%  of  the  population  (2.6  million  households)  was  driven  below  the  extreme  poverty  line  in \n1998 as a result of medical expenses.  \n \n11. \nThe Project will significantly reduce vulnerability. Currently, around 15% of households in \nthe Central Highlands spend more than 10% of their budgets on health care. After the Project, \nthis  proportion  will  drop  to  around  10%  of  the  population  of  the  region.  More  importantly,  the \nbeneficiaries will largely be from poor and ethnic minority households. Figure A16.2 shows the \neffect of the Project on reducing health care expenditure.  \n \nIncreased efficiency and improved health status. The Project will support increased \n12. \nefficiency of the health system by strengthening HCFP, supporting IEC, and strengthening the \npreventative health system. The current organization of health finance, which relies heavily on \nout-of-pocket payments, is inefficient because patients often delay treatment, making the health \ncondition  worse  and  the  eventual  cost  of  treatment  higher.  After  full  implementation  in  the \nCentral Highlands, estimates show that total expenditure by the HCFP will increase health care \nspending by D86.2 billion per year. However, out-of-pocket expenses will drop by D64.1 billion \nper  year.  Although  the  cost  of  HCFP  is  more  than  the  cost  savings,  it  will  lead  to  a  major \nincrease in equity, a large increase in demand for health care and better health outcomes. \n \n13. \nInvesting in IEC and preventative health (through preventative health centers and social \ndisease centers) will improve the mix of services offered. Currently, members of ethnic minority \ngroups suffer from excess mortality, over and above what can be explained by socioeconomic \nconditions and physical access to the health sector. Increased IEC messages targeted at ethnic \nminorities and women will increase the effectiveness of health services. By focusing on ethnic \nminorities, the Project will help reduce this excess mortality, leading to a reduction of the infant \nmortality  rate  of  3  deaths  per  1,000  live  births.  In  addition,  the  increased  investment  in  the \n\n                                                 \n5   World Bank. 1999. Voices of the Poor: Vietnam Country Report.

One  decade  after  the \nProject is approved, this should lead to a reduction in 9,500 infant deaths. This is in addition to a \ndecrease in mortality due to increased investment brought by the Project. \n \n\nFigure A16.2: Effect on the Project on Catastrophic Health Expenditures \n\n \n\nP\nO\nO\n\n(\n \ne\nm\no\nc\nn\n\ni\n \nf\no\n \ne\nr\na\nh\ns\n \ns\na\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\na\nP\n\n)\ne\nr\na\nh\ns\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nCumulative % of pop, ranked by increasing Out-Of-Pocket share\n\nAfter Project\n\nBefore Project\n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEconomic and Fiscal Sustainability of the Project \n\n \n14. \nProject  Poverty  Focus.  The  Project's  classification  of  core  poverty  reduction  is  fully \njustified. The region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam.6 The Project is specifically targeting the \nneeds  of  the  poor,  especially  ethnic  minorities,  with  its  focus  on  health  financing,  on  district \nhealth  centers  in  poor  districts,  and  its  support  to  training,  IEC,  and  preventative  care.  The \nProject's investment in civil works and equipment is in districts with poverty rates well above the \nnational  average.  The  Project's  support  of  preventative  care  focuses  on  diseases  that  largely \naffect the poor: tuberculosis, malaria, and leprosy. The support to HCFP is already targeted and \nwill only benefit the poor and ethnic minorities. \n \nD. \n \nThere are two issues regarding project sustainability. The first is whether provinces can \n15. \nprovide  funds  to  operate  and  maintain  project  investments  and  hire  new  staff.  The  second  is \nwhether HCFP is sustainable, largely a national issue.  \n \nProject  Sustainability.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  is  based  on  conservative \n16. \nassumptions  of  an  increase  in  recurrent  costs  due  to  the  Project.  These  assumptions  include \noperation  and  maintenance  spending  equal  to  10%  of  the  value  of  capital  investment.  The \nProject will also lead to an increase in the number of staff hired, as well as other costs that have \nbeen factored into the analysis. \n \n17. \nThe main source of the public health financing for the four provinces is the state budget. \nNationally, it accounts for about 50% of the funding support to the health sector, although that \npercentage is higher in the Central Highlands. An estimated 70% of the budget is allocated to \nfinancing recurrent costs. The Government has increased public health spending since the early \n1990s  by  about  13%  annually  in  real  terms.  The  analysis  assumes  that  provincial  budgets \nincrease by 10%, below the historic trend. \n                                                 \n6   Using the General Statistic Office poverty line, 52% of the population in the Central Highlands was poor in 1998 compared to 37% \nat the national level. Using the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs poverty line, in 2002 poverty was 17% compared to \n13% at the national level.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n57\n\n \n18. \nBased  on  these  assumptions,  the  provincial  health  systems  will  be  able  to  absorb  the \nadditional  investment.  The  Project  will  increase  provincial  spending  by  $400,000  to  $700,000 \nper  year  (above  what  would  be  spent  without  the  Project),  while  the  budgets  of  the  provinces \nwill increase by $1.3 million to $1.9 million per year. In other words, the Project as a whole will \nlead to a permanent increase of around $2.9 million in the total budget, while total spending will \nincrease by $7.8 million. This gives the provinces more than sufficient funds to increase wages \nof  health  staff  and  to  increase  spending  on  other  services.  Even  if  the  provincial  budget  only \nincreased  by  5%,  the  provinces  would  still  have  sufficient  resources  to  meet  the  additional \nneeds stemming from the Project.  \n \n19. \nTable  A16.1  shows  the  additional  budget  available  to  the  region  under  different \nassumption of the growth of the health budget. It shows the estimated marginal recurrent costs \ngenerated by the Project. \n \n\nTable A16.1: Project Sustainability Estimates \n($) \n\nYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n\n5% increase in \nhealth budget from \nprevious year \n581,446 \n610,518 \n641,044 \n673,096 \n706,751 \n\n8% increase in \nhealth budget from \nprevious year \n1,041,278 \n1,124,581 \n1,214,547 \n1,311,711 \n1,416,648 \n\n10% increase in \nhealth budget from \nprevious year \n1,400,724 \n1,540,796 \n1,694,876 \n1,864,364 \n2,050,800 \n\nAdditional recurrent \ncosts generated by \nProject \n          400,000  \n          600,000  \n          700,000  \n          600,000  \n          600,000  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20. \nSustainability of HCFP. The sustainability of the health sector depends critically on the \nsuccessful  implementation  and  financing  of  HCFP.  The  Government  has  shown  ownership  of \nHCFP by fully financing the first full year of operation at a cost of around $50 million.  \n \n21. \nAnalysis shows that the financing burden of the HCFP for the provinces is minimal. The \nreal  provincial  budget  for  health  is  projected  to  be  53%  higher  in  2010  than  in  2002.  This \nsuggests  that  provincial  health  funding  should  be  sufficient  in  2010  not  only  to  cover  direct \nHCFP  financing  requirements  but  also  to  cover  the  indirect  costs  of  providing  substantially \nhigher  levels  of  health  services  to  HCFP  beneficiaries.  HCFP  is  likely  to  be  sustainable \nnationally by 2010.  \n \n22. \nHCFP are also likely to be sustainable in the Central Highlands provinces by 2010, if not \nearlier. There will be a drop in provincial health financing for other uses when HCFP operations \nbegin in 2003, but the pre-HCFP levels of provincial state budget health funding are likely to be \nexceeded as early as 2004 in Lam Dong, by 2005 in Kon Tum, and by 2006 in Dak Lak and Gia \nLai.  By  2010,  provincial  health  funding  per  capita  that  would  be  available  for  other  uses  is \nprojected  to  have  increased  by  35%  to  49%  from  pre-HCFP  levels  in  the  project  provinces. \nThese increased levels of provincial health funding should be sufficient to cover not only each \nprovince\u2019s  share  of  the  direct  HCFP  financing  burden  but  also  the  cost of  providing  increased \nhealth services to HCFP beneficiaries. \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 November 2003) \n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "dong (D) \n$0.0000640 \nD15,629.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBCC \nCNPM \n", "DALYs \nDHC \nDP \nEMDP \nEMP \nHCFP \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICB \nIEE \nIMR \nIS \nIEC \nLCB \nMIS \nMDGs \nMOH \nNGO \nPMU \nPPMU \nPSC \nSDC \nSida \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbehavior change communications \ncommunicable diseases, nutrition problems, perinatal and \nmaternal conditions \ndisability-adjusted life years \ndistrict health center \ndirect purchase \nethnic minority development plan \nenvironment management plan \nHealth Care Funds for the Poor \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninfant mortality rate \ninternational shopping \ninformation, education, and communication \nlocal competitive bidding \nmanagement information system \nMillennium Development Goals \nMinistry of Health \nnongovernment organization \nproject management unit \nprovincial project management unit \nproject steering committee \nsocial disease center \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", "A team consisting of I.
