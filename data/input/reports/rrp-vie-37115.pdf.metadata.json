Both newly constructed and upgraded \ncivil  works  will  include  capital  investments  to  improve  medical \nsolid waste management and wastewater disposal. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will support the health system and improve the health \nstatus of residents\u2014especially the poor and disadvantaged\u2014in \nthe four provinces of the Central Highlands: Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon \nTum, and Lam Dong. The Government of Sweden, through the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), will \ncofinance the Project. The Project will focus on providing curative \nhealth services to the poor and disadvantaged\u2014including ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  children\u2014by  upgrading  district  health \ncenters and enhancing the skills of health care service providers. \nThe Project will support the effective implementation of the new \ngovernment  initiative,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  139,  aimed  to \nestablish the Health Care Funds for the Poor. The Project will also \nemphasize  building  the  capacity  of  the  provincial  health \ndepartments for planning, financing, and managing health services. \n   \nRationale  The Central Highlands are one of Viet Nam\u2019s poorest regions, with \nrelatively poor health indicators. The main factors contributing to \nthe poor health are (i) inadequate access to quality and culturally \ncompatible health services, (ii) lack of appropriate skills among \nhealth care personnel, and (iii) demand-side issues such as the \nlack  of  affordability  of  health  services  and  demand  for  public \nhealth  services  such  as  institution-based  births.  Health \ninfrastructure  needs  significant  strengthening.  The  quality  of \nhealth services in public and private sectors is poor. Health care \nproviders\u2019 skills need upgrading. Significant capacity building is \nrequired to effectively implement Decision 139.  \n   ", "  iii\nObjectives  Specific project objectives are \n(i)  to  improve  availability  of,  and  access  to,  quality  health \nservices, especially for the poor and disadvantaged; \n(ii)  to  improve  affordability  and  utilization  of  health  services, \nespecially for the poor; and \n(iii)  to strengthen the capacity of the health system to address \neffectively the health needs of the people. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  $30.6  million  equivalent.  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $20  million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, representing 65% of \nthe  total  project  cost. The  Government  of  Sweden  is  likely  to \njointly finance the Project through grants of about $5.6 million \nequivalent. ADB will administer the funds from the Government of \nSweden using ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign   Local   Total   % \nExchange  Cost  Cost \nADB  11.1  8.9  20.0  65.4 \nSida  0.4  5.2  5.6  18.2 \nGovernment  0.0  5.0  5.0  16.4 \nTotal  11.5  19.1  30.6  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Sida = Swedish International Development \nCooperation Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR13,969,000 ($20 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, with a maturity \nterm of 32 years and a grace period of 8 years. It will bear an \ninterest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  Project implementation arrangements follow a partly decentralized \nArrangements  approach  with  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs) \nbeing the principal implementation units. A project management \nunit (PMU) headed by a project director will provide technical, \ncoordination, and logistics support. The PMU will work under the \noverall guidance of a project steering committee headed by the \nMinister of Health, or a vice-minister authorized by the Minister.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Health \n   \n ", "iv   \nProcurement  Goods and services will be procured according to ADB guidelines. \nCivil works in 13 procurement packages will be awarded based on \nlocal  competitive  bidding.  Medical  equipment,  supplies,  and \nfurniture  (23  packages)  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  international  shopping,  local \ncompetitive bidding, or direct purchase. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will use 32 person-months of services by international \nconsultants  and  573  person-months  by  domestic  consultants, \ncomprising  119  person-months  for  the  services  organized  at \ncentral  level  and  454  person-months  services  specific  to \nprovinces. The consultants will be recruited from consulting firms \nor as individuals, depending on the need. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will have a significant impact on the health and well-\nBeneficiaries  being of the Central Highlands population. Since health is closely \nrelated to productivity, it will also help incomes. In the Central \nHighlands, the poverty rate has remained relatively constant at \nabout 52% of the population over the past 5 years, while it has \ndeclined from 37% to 29% nationally over the same period. \n  \nThe Project will benefit 4.4 million people in the Central Highlands \nby improving quality of, and access to, health services. These \nbenefits will target a rural population of 3.2 million, particularly the \n1 million poorest and 1.5 million ethnic minorities. The Project will \nreduce the excess burden of disease and bring it in line with \nnational  averages.  It  will  also  help  the  provinces  achieve  the \nhealth  sector  targets  set  out  in  the  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy and the Millennium Development \nGoals. The infant mortality rate will drop from current level of 64 \nper 1,000 live births to 40 per 1,000 live births by 2008, maternal \nmortality ratio from 170 per 100,000 live births to 110 per 100,000 \nlive births, and coverage of prenatal care will increase from 70% \nto 90%. \n \n  The Project will improve effectiveness and efficiency of the health \nsystem  in  the  four  provinces  by  upgrading  health  facilities, \npreventive  health  centers,  strengthening  training  and \nmanagement capacity, and increasing the quality of health service \ndelivery. The district levels will emphasize the improvement of \nquality health care provision and service delivery. The project will \nalso establish appropriate planning and management procedures \nat provincial, district, and commune levels with trained staff for \nensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  effective  and  efficient  health \nsystem. \n \n  The Project will support the Decision 139 to fully finance the cost \nof health insurance premium or reimbursement of health services \nfor the poor in the Central Highlands. \n ", "  v\n  The Project will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the \nhealth system in the four provinces by upgrading health facilities \nand  preventive  health  centers,  strengthening  training  and \nmanagement capacity, and increasing the quality of health service \ndelivery.

Viet Nam\u2019s health system \nis well established and has been quite successful in delivering \nboth preventive and curative health services. \n \nExternally financed projects in Viet Nam, including those with ADB \nfinancing, have often been slow to make disbursements and meet \nprocurement  targets.  Delays  in  approving  investments  and \nfinalizing documents delayed disbursement, complicating project \ntimetables.  To  reduce  this  risk,  the  Project  will  use  a  semi-\ndecentralized structure, largely eliminating delays caused by poor \ncoordination between national and provincial levels.  \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Health Care in the Central Highlands,1 and (ii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for the Project to be \nprovided by the Government of Sweden. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  During  the  last  decade,  Viet  Nam  has  made  remarkable  progress  towards  the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Viet Nam has already achieved \nseveral MDGs, including those for poverty and child health, and is well on its way to achieving \nothers. Infant mortality fell by nearly 28% from 58 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 42 per 1,000 \nlive births in 2000. Maternal mortality decreased by 50% from about 200 per 100,000 live births \nin 1990 to about 100 per 100,000 live births in 2000. Access to reproductive health services, as \nmeasured by tetanus toxoid immunization, has increased from 71.7% in 1997 to 82.9% in 2001. \nImpressive achievements have also been made in controlling communicable diseases including \nmalaria and tuberculosis. The only MDG that poses a challenge is the controlling and reversing \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS.2 \n \n3.  The Government has a strong policy and institutional structure to support primary health \ncare, which has evolved over the last few years to pay greater attention to the needs of the poor \nand disadvantaged. The Government has recently launched a major policy initiative3 called \nPrime Minister\u2019s Decision 139, which is designed to ensure access to basic health care for the \npoor. According to this new policy, provincial peoples\u2019 committees will establish Health Care \nFunds for the Poor (HCFP)4 to help those living in poor communes and selected ethnic minority \ncommunities gain access to the public health system. The Government has earmarked annual \nfunding of about $50 million for HCFP, which demonstrates its commitment to improving the \nhealth  status  of  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  There  has  been  a  greater  emphasis  on \ndecentralizing the management and provision of health services in recent years. A recent \nsignificant policy measure5 covers all revenue-raising public enterprises and public service \nentities. The measure aims to improve the quality of public services by making entities and \nagencies financially autonomous, and encouraging them to take initiative in determining staff \nnumbers, compensation, and use. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  Impressive  achievements  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  public  health  system  are  tempered  by  the \nsignificant and persistent inequities in health status and use of health services. These inequities \nhave in fact widened in recent years.6 The burden of disease amongst the poor and ethnic \n                                                 \n1  The project framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n3   The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on \u201cHealth Care for the Poor.\u201d \n4  The poor are defined in the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs\u2019 Decision No. 1143/2000/QD-LDTBXH (1 November \n2000).

Bloom, N. Thang, and N. Huu. 2001. Human Capital of the Poor in Viet Nam. Asian Development Bank. ", "2  \nminorities is much higher than among the non-poor. In particular, some groups and regions do \nnot  appear  to  have  benefited  from  the  country\u2019s  impressive  socioeconomic  transformation \nbecause they live far from main growth centers and have low levels of human capital. \n \n5.  The Central Highlands of Viet Nam\u2014comprising the four provinces of Kon Tum, Dak \nLak, Gia Lai and Lam Dong\u2014is home to more than 4 million people and is one of the poorest \nregions in the country. Inhabited by a large number of ethnic minorities living in scattered, \nremote  communities,  the  region  has  inadequate  social  and  physical  infrastructure  despite \nsignificant government investment and commitment. Recognizing the relatively adverse health \nindicators in the region (see Table 1), the Government has a special policy focus7 on improving \nthe health conditions of people, particularly ethnic minorities, in the Central Highlands. The \npolicy calls for proportionately larger budget allocation for the region, as well as free health \nservices  and  training of  local  people  for  providing  services.  The  region  has  also  received \nsignificant investments from external agencies (Appendix 2). \n \nTable 1: Health Status in Viet Nam and the Central Highlands \nHealth Indicator  Viet Nam    Central Highlands \nPoverty incidence (2002)  29.0    52.0 \nUnder-5 Child Malnutrition   33.8    40.9 \nInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1998)  36.7    64.4 \nMaternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births)  95.0    170.0 \nAccess to Reproductive Health       \nModern Contraceptive Use (%)  56.7    41.6 \n  Prenatal Care (3 or more visits, 2000)  69.7    44.8 \nHome Delivery (%)  23.3    55.1 \n  Supervised Delivery (%)  82.4    59.6 \nPrevalence of Malaria (per 100,000 persons)             332             1,369 \nTuberculosis (per 100,000 persons)             71             26 \nHIV/AIDS (per 100,000 people)             56             21 \nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \nNote: All indicators are for 2001, unless otherwise indicated. \nSource: Poverty incidence is based on the 2002 Viet Nam Multipurpose Household Survey. Data on \nunder-5 child malnutrition is from the Bulletin of the Symposium on Healthcare Activities in the \nCentral Highlands, MOH, 2001. Infant mortality rate is from the 1999 Population and Housing \nCensus. Prenatal care is from the Symposium Bulletin, MCH/FP, MOH, 2003. Modern contraceptive \nuse, home delivery, and supervised delivery are from the Viet Nam National Health Survey, 2001-02. \nPrevalence of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS are from 2001 Official MOH statistics. \n \n6.  The main factors contributing to the poor health status in the region are (i) inadequate \naccess to quality, culturally compatible health services, (ii) lack of appropriate skills among \nhealth care personnel, and (iii) demand-side issues such as the lack of affordability of health \nservices and demand for certain public health services such as institution-based births. These \nfactors are interrelated and stem in part from the same socioeconomic and cultural causes. \nCultural beliefs and practices, low population density, lack of adequate physical infrastructure, \nand poverty all contribute to poor health status (see Appendix 3 for detailed analysis). \n \n1.  Health Facilities \n \n7.  Primary  health  care  infrastructure\u2014commune  health  centers  and  intercommune \npolyclinics\u2014is already well established in the Central Highlands. This has been partly supported \nthrough  earlier  projects8  financed  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  However,  curative  health \n                                                 \n7  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 168/2001/QD-TTG dated 30-10-01 on Long-term perspectives, 5-year plan for 2001-2005 and key \nsolutions for socio-economic development in the Central Highlands. \n8  Loan 1460 VIE: Population and Family Health Project approved in November 1996 for $43.0 million supported Dak Lak and Lam \nDong provinces; World Bank-supported National Health Support Project covered Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Kon Tum provinces. \n ", "  3\nservices at the district level require considerable strengthening. For most people living in rural \nareas, the district health centers (DHCs) are the first level of referral care and comprehensive \ncurative services. The Government plans to strengthen health facilities at this level throughout \nthe  region  and  has  already  made  considerable  investments.  However,  there  remains  a \nconsiderable gap in the quality of health services in the region and the rest of the country.  \n \n8.  The recently implemented Decision 139 provides further justification for strengthening \ndistrict-level health infrastructure. This initiative will reduce financial constraints on using health \nservices and is likely to significantly increase the use of district health services by the poor and \nethnic minorities. Use of health services, particularly inpatient services, has already increased in \nmost provinces since the adoption of Decision 139. With full implementation of Decision 139 \nand wider dissemination of information about its benefits, utilization of health services will \nincrease even more. Existing capacity at the district level will be insufficient to cope with the \nincreased demand. Some 40% of the population in the Central Highlands will benefit from \nDecision 139 because the region has a high incidence of poverty and a large number of ethnic \nminorities. The existing capacity of the region\u2019s district health system is already stretched and \nwill not be able to effectively meet increased demand. \n \n9.  The capacity of inpatient wards to meet the increased demand is the biggest constraint \non DHCs. Some DHCs require upgrading or expansion. Others will need to be moved and \nrebuilt in more accessible areas. Current district facilities have poor water supply, sanitation, \nand solid waste disposal. Medical equipment also needs considerable support, both to replace \nold and outdated equipment and to upgrade the quality of service. Imaging and diagnostic \nequipment are particular concerns in most district facilities. \n \n2.  Human Resources \n \n10.  Both quality and quantity of health personnel constrain services in the region. The \nCentral Highlands have about 10% fewer health personnel per capita. Given the low population \ndensity and large geographical distances, fewer staff significantly affect services, particularly \noutreach. The quality of health care providers is also much poorer in the Central Highlands than \nin the rest of the country.  \n \n11.  The  region  faces  the  twin  challenge  of  (i)  upgrading  the  technical  skills  of  health \nprofessionals,  and  (ii)  ensuring  continued  maintenance  of  applied  skills.  Lack  of  skills  is \nparticularly acute for medical doctors in the areas of surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, internal \nmedicine, infectious diseases, and public health. Basic health care is difficult to provide at the \ndistrict level in the absence of specialized doctors. There is also a need to train health care \nproviders who speak the local language. Improving frontline primary care services are is also \nneeded  to  improve  quality  of  care  at  the  commune  and  district  levels.  Strengthening  the \ncapacity of secondary medical schools, responsible for providing primary pre-service and in-\nservice training, is also required to improve quality of clinical health services. \n \n3.  Demand for Health Services \n \n12.  Lack of affordability is the major demand-side constraint for the poor in accessing health \nservices. Decision 139 is a bold initiative taken to address this constraint for the poor and \ndisadvantaged populations through the establishment of the HCFP. This will help improve the \nhealth status of the poor by increasing their access to and utilization of health services. It will \nalso potentially reduce the impact of high out-of-pocket health care expenses on household \nbudgets. Promising as it is, the success of the policy initiative cannot be taken for granted. \n ", "4  \nSuccess of Decision 139 will depend on the ability of the Government and provinces to (i) \nallocate  sufficient  resources;  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  and  guidelines  for  allocating  and \nmanaging  funds,  benefit  packages,  and  payments  to  providers;  (iii)  develop  a  transparent \nsystem  for  identifying  beneficiaries;  (iv)  empower  beneficiaries  to  expect  and  demand  the \nintended services; and (v) institutionalize a system of monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of \nthe implementation and impact of Decision 139. Support is needed for these aspects of the \ninitiative. \n \n13.  Cultural and language barriers are another challenge for making health services more \naccessible to the poor, especially ethnic minority groups. Health promotion and prevention will \nbecome increasingly more important as the burden of disease changes from communicable to \nthe noncommunicable diseases. This will require significant changes in the materials developed \nfor information, education, and communication (IEC) and in the ways health messages are \ndisseminated.  This  will  entail  greater  community  involvement  in  providing  and  monitoring \nservices, and more culturally sensitive health promotion and behavior change communication \n(BCC) programs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n14.  The Project will support the health system and improve the health status of people\u2014\nespecially the poor and disadvantaged\u2014in the four Central Highlands provinces: Dak Lak, Gia \nLai, Kon Tum, and Lam Dong. Specific project objectives are \n \n(i)  to improve availability of, and access to, quality health services, especially for the \npoor and disadvantaged; \n(ii)  to improve affordability and utilization of health services, especially for the poor; \nand \n(iii)  to strengthen the capacity of the health system to address effectively the health \nneeds of the people. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The project design is based on an extensive review of health needs and investment \noptions in the Central Highlands. The Project was developed in consultation with the Ministry of \nHealth  (MOH),  provincial  and  district  authorities,  communities,  and  international  agencies \nworking in the health sector. The Project has the following three components: \n \n1.  Upgrading Facilities and Equipment \n \n16.  The Project will focus on improving the quality of care and utilization of services that \naddress the immediate health needs of the rural population. It will also strengthen the capacity \nof the provincial health system to meet the increased demand for health services stemming from \nthe implementation of Decision 139. The Project will ensure that these services are sustainable. \n \n17.  Curative Health Services. The major focus will be on strengthening the DHCs, which \noften represent the first level of care in the community. People living in rural and remote areas \noften seek curative services from these health centers. The DHCs include inpatient, diagnostic, \nand  treatment  facilities,  as  well  as  other  clinical  support  facilities.  The  Project  will  also \n ", "  5\nstrengthen the referral system and support a regional hospital to develop local capacity to \ndiagnose and treat complicated health conditions. \n \n18.  The Project will finance upgrading of services in 15 DHCs. The exact scope of activities \nvaries from the center to center and is based on the needs and projected utilization of the \ncenter. In 13 DHCs, support will be provided for new facilities and upgrading of inpatient wards, \ntechnical blocks, solid waste management, and water and sanitation systems. Support for solid \nwaste management and water, and sanitation systems will also be provided in 2 DHCs. \n \n19.  The Project will also finance the procurement of appropriate equipment for 16 DHCs to \nimprove service quality. The new equipment will (i) replace old and non-functioning equipment; \nor (ii) upgrade technology for existing procedures; or (iii) seek to provide new services. The \nProject  will  ensure  that  health  personnel  are  properly  trained  to  use  the  equipment,  and \noperational manuals are supplied in Vietnamese. The Government has provided assurances \nthat equipment will be maintained during and beyond the project period through adequate \nincreases in operation and maintenance budgets. \n \n20.  The Project will also provide some limited support for a provincial hospital in Dak Lak, \nwhich is becoming a regional hospital to support the tertiary health care needs for the entire \nCentral Highlands. It will act as a model for health services and will provide training for health \ncare providers in the region. The Government largely finances the hospital. The Project will \nsupport the procurement of its medical equipment. The Project will also support strengthening of \nthe referral system and networking between provinces and the hospital. \n \n21.  Preventive  Health  Services.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  preventive  health \ninfrastructure\u2014including the provincial preventive health centers, social disease centers, and \nIEC  centers\u2014to  combat  communicable  diseases  and  generate  demand  for  public  health \nservices. \n \n22.  Provincial  preventive  health  centers,  located  in  the  provincial  capitals,  provide \ninstitutional  and  research  support  for  overall  monitoring,  supervision,  and  management  of \nepidemics and outbreaks at the provincial and national levels. The Project will support the \nstrengthening of these preventive health centers to increase effectiveness of national health \nprograms in all four provinces. In Lam Dong province, the Project will support construction of a \nnew facility and provision of laboratory equipment. In other provinces, government funds will be \nused to build new facilities and the Project will support upgrading of laboratory equipment. This \nsupport  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  related  training  to  laboratory  technicians  and \ndevelopment  of  more  effective  system  for  monitoring  and  surveillance  of  major  health \nconditions. \n \n23.  The Project will support strengthening of the social disease centers in all four provinces. \nThese social disease centers are located close to provincial health centers to provide support \nfor tuberculosis, leprosy, and sexually transmitted infections.9 They manage implementation of \nnational programs for these diseases. The Project will upgrade laboratories to improve their \ncapacity to diagnose and treat the diseases, and to monitor more effectively implementation of \nnational programs. \n \n                                                 \n9 Tuberculosis, leprosy, and sexually transmitted infections are commonly referred to as \u201csocial diseases\u201d in Viet \nNam. \n ", "6  \n24.  IEC  centers,  located  at  provincial  headquarters,  implement  and  supervise  the  BCC \ncomponent  of  almost  all  health  programs,  and  produce  and  disseminate  public  health \nmessages. These IEC centers have been only recently established. The Project will strengthen \ntheir capacity to manage more effective, culturally responsive BCC efforts by supporting new \nIEC facilities, equipment, and training in Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum provinces. \n \n2.  Human Resources Development  \n \n25.  Recognizing the critical need to improve the skills of health care providers in the region, \ntraining activities form a significant part of the Project. It will finance several training activities \nand strengthen the secondary medical schools in the four provinces. The Project will support \nclinical training for doctors and nurses, as well as primary health care and BCC training.  \n \n26.  Clinical Training. The Project will upgrade technical skills of medical staff at the district \nand  provincial  health  centers  in  internal  medicine,  emergency  care,  surgery,  pediatrics, \nobstetrics, gynecology, infectious diseases, and public health. Training will entail two types of \nprograms. One program provides a 3-month attachment at the provincial hospital. About 408 \ndistrict medical officers will participate in this program. The Project will also support a program \nto train 209 nurses and other health personnel in clinical skills. A second program will provide \nspecialist degrees for selected medical staff at district and provincial levels. This will benefit 204 \ndoctors. Courses will be organized in medical schools in Hue, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi. \nTraining in clinical skills will assist in fully utilizing the investments made in upgrading the health \nfacilities. It will also boost health care providers\u2019 motivation and help attract and retain qualified \nmedical professionals.  \n \n27.  Many  candidates  from  ethnic  minority  groups  cannot  successfully  compete  through \nentrance examination for postgraduate medical degrees because they often lack language and \nstatistical skills, so the Project will support a coaching program to help them better prepare for \nthe examination. In addition, a certain percentage of all vacancies for postgraduate degree \ncourses will be reserved for candidates from ethnic minority groups. \n \n28.  Primary Health Care Training. The Project will finance training of 1,720 commune- and \ndistrict-level health workers on quality of care. Secondary medical schools in each province will \norganize these courses. The training curricula will draw on the experience of similar efforts by \nMOH in other projects and regions. The scope and extent of commune-level training will be \nassessed jointly with Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) during the \nmidterm review. Depending upon the outcome of the assessment, these activities may be \nfurther expanded. The Project will also support annual training programs for BCC activities, i.e. \ncounseling and mass-media campaigns. IEC centers in each province will plan and organize \nthese training programs, which will target 240 people. The major objective of these programs \nwill be to make the health services more responsive to the poor and ethnic minorities. \n \n29.  Secondary  Medical  Schools.  Secondary  medical  schools  are  key  to  training  and \nmaintaining  a  qualified  health  workforce.  The  Project  will  support  strengthening  secondary \nmedical schools to increase their capacity to provide strong training programs. The Project will \nsupply training equipment in the four provinces. In Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces, the Project \nwill support construction of teaching rooms, practice rooms, and a hostel. The Project will help \nthe Dak Lak school become a regional training school, providing support to the entire region. \n \n ", "  7\n3.  Strengthening Financing and Management \n \n30.  The Project will support MOH and the provincial departments of health in effectively \nimplementing Decision 139, and improving the management information system (MIS) and \nsurveillance of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n31.  Effective implementation of Decision 139 poses a considerable challenge since the \nproportion of poor in the Central Highlands is greater than any other region of the country. There \nare  about  1.7  million  people  in  the  region\u2014about  40%  of  the  Central  Highlands\u2019  total \npopulation\u2014eligible  for  subsidized  services.  Through  financing  from  Sida,  the  Project  will \ninstitutionalize mechanisms for effective monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of both the \nimplementation and impact of the HCFP. The Project will also finance part of the provincial \ncontribution to HCFP based on criteria determined during implementation. The Project will \nsupport development of an information system to monitor the use of services at both the \nprovincial and national levels. At the provincial level, it will also finance regular household \nsurveys to assess the impact on the use of services and out-of-pocket expenditures by the poor. \n \n32.  The  Project  will  document  and  disseminate  the  effectiveness  of  targeting  intended \nbeneficiaries and implementation experience through specially sponsored studies. Lessons from \nthe Central Highlands will be useful in fine-tuning the implementation of Decision 139 in the \nwhole country. The Project will also provide selected support for national implementation. \n \n33.  The Project will strengthen the MIS in the four provinces with a view to strengthening \nsupervision and management of health services. Improved MIS will also provide critical, timely \ninformation about incidence and prevalence of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. \nThe Project will also support training at all levels to strengthen management. The focus at the \ncommune and district levels is (i) improving supervision of technical care, (ii) strengthening \nplanning and organization of care, and (iii) enhancing financial sustainability of facilities. \n \n34.  The Project will help strengthen the capacity of MOH and provincial health departments \nto implement the project by supporting a project management unit (PMU) and provincial project \nmanagement units (PPMUs). The Project will finance the necessary equipment and consulting \nservices required for effective implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of project activities. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Environment \n \n35.  The  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  effect  and  will  improve \nconsiderably  current  waste  management  practices  (see  Appendix  4  for  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination). Most civil works will upgrade existing health facilities, rehabilitating \nstructures and replacing outdated equipment. The new civil works are small in scale and will not \nadversely affect any ecosystems. Design of civil works will address disposal of hazardous \nmedical wastes. A major component is to improve waste management. Given the potential \nenvironmental  and  health  hazards  from  medical  waste,  an  environment  management  plan \n(EMP), including a waste management plan, will be developed for each district health center.  \nADB assisted the MOH in developing an outline of the EMP, which was endorsed by MOH. The \nProject includes provisions for upgrading and improving waste management based on local \nconditions and existing practice. Alternative technologies for waste disposal have been carefully \nconsidered and investigated. This will follow the draft national master plan for medical waste \n ", "8  \nmanagement,10 which discourages the use of incinerators at the district level. Sufficient funds \nhave been allocated to meet the cost of installing and/or upgrading medical waste systems. The \nProject will also support training for medical staff, including nurses, in proper waste separation, \nstorage, and disposal. Steps for safe medical waste management will follow best practice for \nlow resource settings, based on World Health Organization recommendations and current MOH \npolicies and procedures. \n \n2.  Social Analysis \n \n36.  The Project does not have any adverse social impacts. Some social issues the Project \naddresses include: \n \na.  Poverty \n \n37.  The Project will improve the availability and appropriateness of quality health services, \nincrease user affordability and utilization of health services, and strengthen the capacity of the \npublic health system in the central highland provinces. During project preparation, a needs \nassessment was undertaken to identify (i) the existing burden of disease on the poor and ethnic \nminority groups, (ii) their ability to pay for proposed project services, (iii) strategies to optimize \ntheir use of the services, (iv) the current capacity of the health system to effectively address \ntheir  health  needs,  and  (v)  cost-sharing  mechanisms  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the \nregional health system and improve the overall equity of health financing. Poverty issues have \nbeen fully incorporated into the project design so that the poor and disadvantaged benefit \ndisproportionately. The Project will make a significant contribution to reducing the poverty and \nvulnerability caused by poor health. In 1998, 3.4% of households were driven into extreme \npoverty  because  of  excessive  expenditure  on  health  care.  As  a  result  of  this  support, \napproximately  220,000  people  will  see  their  health  care  costs  drop  below  10%  of  total \nhousehold expenditure. This pro-poor health financing system will make the health financing \nsubstantially less regressive (Appendix 5).  \n \nb.  Community Participation \n \n38.  A successful health strategy integrates availability of services with public participation. \nThe Project places a strong emphasis on community involvement and the use of services by all \ncommunity members. Past experiences from community-based health education and training \nprograms will be evaluated, and lessons learned will be incorporated into the Project where \nappropriate. Morbidity and mortality drop dramatically when resources respond to the unique \nneeds  of  each  community.  Linkages  between  different levels  of  the  health system  will  be \nstrengthened to ensure sustainability of initiatives. Special initiatives will be taken to involve \npeople in health insurance schemes. Women\u2019s participation will be central to programs on \nmaternal and child health. Attitudes and knowledge of particular health issues will determine the \neffectiveness of services. The community will work more closely in assessing health needs and \nidentifying solutions. \n \n39.  The  provincial  health  departments  have  carried  out  initial  consultations  with  district \nauthorities  and  civil  society  on  the  proposed  civil  works  for  district  health  centers.  These \nconsultations included discussions on potential resettlement and environmental impacts, as well \nas the proposed design, to ensure that local needs are met. Additional public consultations will \n                                                 \n10  Ministry of Health. National Master Plan for A System of Treatment of Health-Care Solid Waste in Viet Nam. Final Draft 28 March \n2003.  \n ", "  9\nbe held to discuss resettlement of affected people. Local authorities will also discuss with \naffected  communities  the  site-specific  environmental  management  plans  and  initial \nenvironmental examinations. \n \nc.  HIV/AIDS  \n \n40.  HIV/AIDS poses a special threat to populations, especially ethnic minority groups, in the \nCentral Highlands. Current estimates show that 21 per 100,000 people in the Central Highlands \nare infected with the disease, compared to 56 per 100,000 nationwide. The populations in the \nCentral Highlands are relatively isolated from mainstream society, which offers some protection \nfrom infection but also impedes education and prevention programs. For ethnic minorities in \nparticular, cultural and language barriers may also limit access to materials and information, \nthereby increasing the risk of infection and vulnerability of marginalized populations. The Project \nwill help to strengthen current efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS through the preventive \nhealth  infrastructure  and  health  promotion  programs  specifically  targeted  at  HIV/AIDS. \nHIV/AIDS activities will be mainstreamed through training project staff and construction workers. \n \nd.  Ethnic Minorities \n \n41.  The  Project  fully  integrates  concerns  of  ethnic  minority  groups  into  subcomponent \ndesign and does not harm any specific group. The Project will benefit close to 1.5 million \nmembers  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  four  central  highland  provinces.  An  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan  has  been  prepared  to  highlight  project  benefits  to  ethnic  minority \ncommunities, and ensure they have access to affordable, high-quality health services in a more \nequitable health system (Appendix 6).  \n \ne.  Gender \n \n42.  The Project fully mainstreams gender concerns into its design to ensure that women \nshare proportionately in project benefits. The Project aims to improve and raise the health status \nof about 2.2 million women, including 800,000 ethnic minority women. The Project emphasizes \nwomen\u2019s health, particularly in the areas of reproductive health, obstetrics, gynecological care, \nand maternal and child health. Improved access to reproductive health services will prevent half \nof the current maternal deaths per year by the end of the Project, and significantly increase the \nproportion of deliveries in the region receiving improved pre- and postnatal care. The Project will \nreduce the burden of disease for women, and help increase women\u2019s social contribution to their \nfamilies and communities. A gender strategy has been prepared to ensure that women have \nincreased access to and utilization of affordable and high-quality health services (Appendix 7).  \n \nf.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n43.  The level of involuntary resettlement is significant. Land acquired for new and relocated \nhealth facilities will total about 15.2 hectares. Civil works will affect an estimated 38 households, \nincluding  shops,  which  will  require  relocation.  Some  affected  households  will  also  lose \nagricultural land. All losses will be compensated at full replacement cost and current market \nvalue. Transition allowances will be provided and rehabilitation measures will ensure restoration \nof income-generating activities. Affected persons have been informed about the Project and \nhave been consulted during preparation of the resettlement plan. Provisions have been included \nto help affected households restore living standards to pre-project levels or better. A summary \nof the land acquisition and resettlement is provided in Appendix 8, and the resettlement plan in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n ", "10  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n44.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $30.6  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to provide a loan of SDR14.0 million ($20 million equivalent) from its Special \nFunds resources, representing 65% of the total project cost and covering the major part of the \ncapital expenditures. The Government will provide counterpart funds of $5 million equivalent for \nrecurrent costs and some capital expenditure. The Government of Sweden, through Sida, will \njointly cofinance the Project through grants of about $5.6 million equivalent to support the \nimplementation of Decision 139 (Appendix 9). ADB will administer Sida\u2019s grant funds following \nits guidelines and procedures. \n \n45.  ADB will finance most project capital expenditure, including civil works, equipment, and \ntraining, while the Government will provide counterpart funds to cover some implementation \ncosts, capital, and recurrent expenses as necessary. Sida financing will support the HCFP, \ncapacity building for implementing Decision 139, and consulting services for health financing \nand quality of care. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates and Sources of Funds  \n($ million) \n  Project Component   \nItem  Upgrading Facilities and  Human Resources  Management  Total \n  Equipment  Development  and Financing   \nADB  14.0  4.2  1.8  20.0 \nSida  0.0  0.0  5.6  5.6 \nGovernment  3.2  0.9  0.9  5.0 \nTotal  17.2  5.1  8.3  30.6 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n46.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 65% of the total project cost (Table 3). The loan would cover $11.1 million \nof the foreign exchange cost (including interest on the loan) and $8.9 million equivalent, or 46% \nof local currency costs. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. It will bear an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter.  \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign   Local   Total   % \nExchange  Cost  Cost \nADB  11.1  8.9  20.0  65.4 \nSida  0.4  5.2  5.6  18.2 \nGovernment  0.0  5.0  5.0  16.4 \nTotal  11.5  19.1  30.6  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n47.  Financing for the local currency cost is justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing \npolicy. Viet Nam needs a large investment program to support the health sector. The need to \ngenerate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  to  sustain  economic  growth  is  well \nrecognized. However, the country would need some time to develop the resources to finance \nthe required investment without external finance. Under the current circumstances, a large \ninvestment-savings gap will continue, hindering poverty  reduction and human  development \n ", "  11\nprograms that have a large local currency component. A higher percentage of local financing for \nthis project is consistent with ADB policy. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n48.  MOH will be the executing agency for the Project. Learning from the experience of \nearlier projects in MOH, implementation arrangements follow a partly decentralized approach. \nUnder this structure, the PPMUs will be the principal units for implementation in each province, \nand one national PMU will provide technical, coordination, and logistics support. Relevant MOH \ndepartments  will  actively  participate  in  implementing  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project. \nHuman resource development will be delegated to the Department of Science and Training, and \nstrengthening financing and management for Decision 139 will be delegated to the Department \nof Planning and Finance. The PMU will monitor physical and financial progress and provide \ntechnical, coordination, and logistics support to the PPMUs and departments in charge of \nimplementation. The project management structure is in Appendix 10.  \n \n49.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be \nestablished. The PSC will be headed by the health minister, or a vice minister whom he or she \nauthorizes, and will include senior officials from participating ministries and institutions. The \nPMU will work under the guidance of the PSC. The PMU, headed by a project director, will start \noperation  with  four  staff  with  expertise  including  planning,  accounting,  disbursement, \nprocurement, and contract administration. Additional staff will be assigned depending on the \nworkload during implementation. \n \n50.  The  PPMUs,  with  assistance  from  the  PMU,  will  work  under  the  guidance  of  the \nprovincial  people\u2019s  committee  and  will  be  headed  by  the  director  of  provincial  health \ndepartment.  Each  PPMU  will  begin  operation  with  three  staff  for  planning,  accounting, \ndisbursement,  procurement,  and  contract  administration.  Staff  to  organize  community \nparticipation and BCC activities will also ensure community-based implementation. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n51.  The Project will be implemented over an estimated 6-year period beginning 15 January \n2004 and ending 31 December 2009. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11.  \n \n3.  Procurement of Goods and Services \n \n52.  All  ADB  and  Sida-financed  procurement  and  consulting  services  will  follow  ADB \nguidelines.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  procurement  that  requires  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) and international shopping (IS) procedures, and (ii) engagement of \ninternational consultants. The PPMUs will be given responsibility for (i) procurement that follows \nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct  purchase  (DP);  (ii)  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants for each province; and (iii) implementation of provincial training programs; and (iv) \nother  local  procurement  following  the  division  of  work  and  implementation  regulations  as \nestablished  at  the  commencement  of  the  Project.  Procedures  for  LCB  procurement, \nengagement of domestic consultants, and selection of training providers or institutes will follow \ngovernment  procedures  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Indicative  lists  of \nprocurement packages, consulting services requirements, and training programs are presented \nin Appendixes 12, 13, and 14, respectively.  \n ", "12  \n \na.  Civil Works \n \n53.  Civil works subprojects will be small and scattered, and are unlikely to attract foreign \nbidders. Civil works should use LCB procedures unless they exceed $2 million equivalent, in \nwhich case ICB procedures will be followed.  \n \nb.  Equipment and Materials \n \n54.  The  PMU  will  procure  medical  equipment  following  ICB  procedures  if  the  package \namount  exceeds  $500,000,  IS  procedures  if  below  $500,000,  LCB  procedures  if  below \n$200,000, or DP if below $100,000. The PMU and PPMUs will procure office equipment and \nvehicles by IS or DP depending on the amount of the contract. Office furniture, computers, \nmotorcycles, and bicycles will be purchased using LCB or DP. An indicative list of equipment to \nbe procured under the Project is in Appendix 15. \n \nc.  Consulting Services \n \n55.  The Project will use 32 person-months of international consulting services and 573 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. Domestic consulting services comprise 119 \nperson-months for services organized at the central level and 454 person-months of services \nspecific to provinces. Consultants will be recruited from consulting firms or as individuals as \nneeded. Consulting firms will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection. Domestic \nconsultants for provincial services will be engaged by the individual PPMUs. The PMU and \nPPMUs may use contracted staff instead of or in addition to domestic consultants, depending on \nthe organization of work. International consultants comprise an architect, an equipment and \nprocurement specialist, a public health expert with background in quality of care, and a health \neconomist. The PPMUs may engage contract staff or domestic consultants as needed to assist \nbuilding design, bidding, progress monitoring, and site supervision.  \n \n4.  Advance Action \n \n56.  The MOH will take advance action for procuring equipment, civil works, and consulting \nservices. MOH will complete approval of the procurement plan for the PMU\u2019s and PPMUs\u2019 \nequipment  and  furniture  for  so  that  procurement  takes  place  immediately  upon  loan \neffectiveness. The MOH will also prepare a shortlist of consultants together with the draft \nrequests of proposal and draft contracts for approval by ADB. \n \n5.  Disbursement Procedures \n \n57.  Disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  handbook. \nExpenditures valued at $100,000 or less will utilize the statement-of-expenditure procedure. An \nimprest account to facilitate payment under the ADB loan will be established at the central level \nwith a ceiling of $1 million within 3 months of loan effectiveness to provide advance funds. \nSecond-generation accounts will be established in project provinces with an initial ceiling of \n$100,000 or 6 months\u2019 expenditure, whichever is less. It will be maintained according to the loan \ndisbursement handbook. Disbursement of Sida grant funds will follow similar procedures unless \nADB and Sida agree otherwise. The MOH will submit separate withdrawal applications for \ndisbursing Sida\u2019s grant funds. An imprest account for Sida funds may be established by mutual \nagreement. Such an account, if established, will be maintained separately from the ADB imprest \naccount.   \n ", "  13\n \n6.  Accounts and Auditing \n \n58.  The Government, acting through MOH, will maintain separate records and accounts \nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan and Sida\u2019s \ngrant. The PMU will (i) keep project accounts separate from regular accounts; (ii) separate \naccounts for the ADB loan and Sida\u2019s grant funds; (iii) ensure accounts and financial statements \nare audited annually, according to sound accounting principles, by external auditors acceptable \nto ADB; and (iv) submit to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, \ncertified copies of audited project accounts and financial statements, the auditor\u2019s reports and \nopinions, and management letter together with a report of actions taken by MOH to improve the \nfinancial management system based on the auditor\u2019s findings and recommendations. MOH will \nselect  and  appoint  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  within  sufficient  time  to  carry  out  its \nresponsibilities. Cost of auditing will be financed by the loan. \n \n7.  Reporting \n \n59.  MOH will submit a monthly progress report to ADB until the loan is declared effective. \nDuring implementation, the PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports. The reports will be \nprepared in the format provided in the project administration memorandum. It will summarize (i) \nprogress made against established targets, including aspects of quality; (ii) delays, problems \nencountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) a \nproposed  program  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected \nprogress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance and repair activities undertaken on \nthe health facilities. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on the execution of the Project, including \ncosts and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n8.  Midterm Review of the Project \n \n60.  The Government, ADB, and Sida will jointly undertake a midterm review after 3 years of \nphysical implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the scope, design, implementation \narrangements, and other relevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development strategies and \nthe  policy  framework  and  strategic  social  concerns  of  ADB;  (ii)  examine  progress  toward \nachieving the measurable objectives of the Project; (iii) identify changes since appraisal relating to \nsector issues, resource management, allocation, etc., and reassess their impact on future project \nimplementation and sustainability; (iv) assess implementation performance against appropriate \nprojections;  (v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify \nproblems and constraints; and (vii) formulate appropriate recommendations for corrective action.  \n \n9.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation System \n \n61.  The Project has selected a short list of verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation. \nBaseline values for these indicators will be estimated using data from the Viet Nam National \nHealth Survey undertaken in 2001-02. Final values of the indicators will be estimated from data \nfrom a household survey planned at the end of the Project. Analysis of the verifiable indicators \nwill be disaggregated by province and district, socioeconomic status, sex, and ethnicity. The \nProject will monitor the environmental impact of the interventions by monitoring waste disposal \nand by checking the water quality of randomly selected wells near Project-financed health \ncenters.  Monitoring  of  resettlement  activities,  including  relocated  families,  will  also  be \nincorporated. \n ", "14  \n \n62.  MOH, with the assistance of the project consultant team, will carry out the midterm \nreview and a final evaluation. The loan will finance the evaluation cost. For the evaluation, the \nPMU will have overall responsibility for data collection, analysis, and reporting to all interested \nparties, including ADB. Delivery of services to the target beneficiaries, use of services, and \nimpact of project activities will be monitored through regular reports and routine data collection \nduring the implementation period. Focus group discussion with beneficiaries will be carried out \nat the midterm review and at the end of the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits \n63.  The Project will have a significant impact on the health and well-being of the population \nin the Central Highlands. Since health is closely related to productivity, it will also have an \nindirect impact on income. The Project will directly reduce poverty incidence by reducing out-of-\npocket expenditure on health by the poor and near-poor, and providing financial protection \nagainst catastrophic health conditions. The efficiency and productivity of the health sector in the \nregion will also be improved (see Appendix 16 for details).  \n \n64.  Improved Health Status. The Project will benefit 4.4 million people in the Central \nHighlands through improved quality of, and access to, health services. These benefits will target \na  rural  population  of  3.2  million,  particularly  the  1  million  poorest  and  1.5  million  ethnic \nminorities. The Project will reduce the excess burden of disease in the Central Highlands and \nbring it in line with the national averages. It will also help the provinces achieve the health sector \ntargets set in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. The infant mortality \nrate will fall from 64 per 1,000 live births now to 40 per 1,000 live births in 2008, the maternal \nmortality ratio will drop from 170 per 100,000 live births to 110 per 100,000 live births, and \ncoverage of prenatal care will rise from 70% to 90%. \n \n65.  Poverty Reduction and Increased Equity. The Project will support the government\u2019s \ndecision to fully finance health insurance for the Central Highlands\u2019 poor, or to reimburse them \nfor  health  services.  This  will  reduce  out-of-pocket  expenses  on  health  care  and  free  up \nresources for other expenses such as food and housing. This pro-poor health financing will also \nmake the health care payment less regressive, and will protect the poor against catastrophic \nhealth outcomes, a frequent cause of destitution and deep poverty. \n \n66.  Increased Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Health System. Improved quality of \nhealth care services, increased efficiency in health care delivery, and increased staff knowledge \nand skills will increase the overall efficiency of the health care system in the Central Highlands. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  health  system  in  the  four \nprovinces  with  the  measures  of  upgrading  health  facilities  and  preventive  health  centers, \nstrengthening training and management capacity, and increasing the quality of health service \ndelivery. The district levels will emphasize improving of quality health care provision and service \ndelivery. The project will also establish appropriate planning and management procedures at \nprovincial, district, and commune levels with trained staff to ensure the sustainability of the \neffective and efficient health system. \n \n ", "  15\nB.  Risks \n67.  The Project has few technical risks. Viet Nam\u2019s health system is well established and \nhas been quite successful in delivering both preventive and curative health services. Viet Nam \nhas shown it can manage a broad, decentralized health system that addresses the health needs \nof the population, including the poor and vulnerable. The Project will support technologies and \nprocedures that are well understood and tested both internationally and in Viet Nam.  \n \n68.  The Government has recently increased its investment in the Central Highlands\u2019 health \nsystem, and implementing an additional, substantial investment program may pose a serious \nchallenge for the Government. The Project focuses on managing the health system at the local \nlevel  and  will  provide  adequate  support  for  training,  capacity  building,  and  management \nsystems.  It  will  also  take  steps  to  streamline  the  administrative  requirements  so  that \nimplementing agencies can focus on the technical details of the Project.  \n \n69.  Externally financed projects Viet Nam, including those with ADB financing, have often \nbeen slow to meet disbursement and procurement targets. Delays in approving investment \nplans and finalizing documents have delayed disbursement and complicated project timetables. \nTo reduce this risk, the Project will use a decentralized structure and largely eliminate delays \nfrom  poor  coordination  between  national  and  provincial  governments.  The  implementation \nperiod will also include an initial phase to help provinces familiarize themselves with ADB \nprocedures. This will allow for more realistic planning both by the Government and ADB. \n \n70.  Sustainability is a major issue for all development projects. The Project will focus on \nbuilding  infrastructure,  supplying  equipment,  and  enhancing  training.  However,  these \ninvestments require continued government support to ensure that the health system does not \nallow its investments to deteriorate. Adequate budget is needed for operation and maintenance, \nand salaries must be adequate to ensure that trained employees keep their positions. The \nGovernment must also provide additional medical equipment, training material, supplies, and \ndrugs to ensure that project investments provide meaningful services. With careful planning, this \nis not likely to be a problem. Government spending on health has increased substantially, \noutpacing  economic  growth.  Health  is  clearly  a  major  priority.  Economic  growth  has  also \ngenerated  additional  resources  for  households  and  local  governments.  Decision  139  will \ntransfer substantial resources to the health system, particularly in poor and remote areas.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the following assurances will be required from \nthe Government and MOH: \n \n(i)  Implementation of Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 139. The provinces will have \nprovided health cards to all people eligible for assistance under Decision 139 in \nthe project area during the first year of loan effectiveness. The Government will \ncontinue to provide at least 75% of the contribution required for the HCFP. Within \n1 year of loan effectiveness, MOH will have established detailed guidelines for \nimplementing Decision 139 to include accounting and auditing practices, as well \nas  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements.  After  3  years,  the  provinces  will \nundertake  a  review  of  the  implementation  of  Decision  139  in  terms  of  how \neffectively it gives the poor access to high-quality health care and how likely it is \n ", "16  \nto be sustainable. The findings of the review will be used to revise Decision 139 \nimplementation procedures, if necessary, during the last 2 years of the Project. \n \n(ii)  Ethnic minorities. The Government and MOH will ensure the implementation of \nthe ethnic minority development plan, prepared according to ADB guidelines, to \nincrease  the  quality  of  and  access  to  health  services  received  by  ethnic \nminorities.  The  Government  and  MOH  will  further  ensure  that  the  ethnic \nminorities have equitable opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, and \npromotion of health workers. \n \n(iii)  Gender strategy. The Government and MOH will ensure the implementation of \nthe  gender  strategy  prepared  during  appraisal.  They  will  further  ensure  that \npriority will be given to women in selecting participants for all training activities, \nwith a view to achieving at least the same proportion of women trainees as in the \noverall pool of the targeted staff. The ultimate goal is to reach gender equality in \nthe training, recruitment, and promotion of health workers. \n \n(iv)  Environment.  MOH  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  location,  design, \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation of health facilities will follow ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policy, as well as MOH policies and procedures on medical waste \nmanagement. Each district health center will prepare an EMP for approval by \nMOH and ADB. For all major civil works, a site-specific environment examination \nwill ensure that proper mitigation measures are mainstreamed. Training will be \nprovided to relevant medical staff in medical waste management, including waste \nseparation and equipment operation. MOH will also ensure that the provinces will \nhave sufficient budget to operate and maintain the waste management plan. \n \n(v)  HIV/AIDS. MOH will ensure that HIV/AIDS activities are mainstreamed in the \nProject through the following measures: (a) project staff at central, provincial, and \ndistrict levels will be trained in knowledge and awareness of HIV/AIDS, as well as \nhow to plan for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS within the project areas; (b) \nconstruction workers in the Project will be educated in how to prevent HIV/AIDS; \n(c) relevant HIV/AIDS issues will be integrated in all training activities for health \ncare  providers;  and  (d)  HIV/AIDS  messages  will  be  integrated  in  the  BCC \nactivities supported by the Project. \n \n(vi)  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. Adequate budgetary support will be \ncommitted  and  made  available  to  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Approval for civil works contracts will be given after the required \nland  has  been  acquired  and  affected  households  have  been  relocated  and \ncompensated at full replacement costs. If any additional affected households are \nfound during implementation, the resettlement plan will be revised to include \nthem. Resettlement activities will be conducted in line with Vietnamese laws and \nADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. In case of discrepancies between the \nVietnamese laws and ADB\u2019s requirements on involuntary resettlement, ADB\u2019s \npolicy will apply. \n \n(vii)  Integration with other projects. MOH will ensure that experiences from other \nrelevant projects are integrated in project implementation. In particular, MOH will \nevaluate the effectiveness of training programs being undertaken under the Sida-\n ", "  17\nsupported Community-Based Health Development Project. The findings of the \nevaluation will be discussed during the midterm review for potential integration in \nproject  activities.  A  similar  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  other  relevant \nprojects.  The  MOH  will  also  consider  the  use  of  manuals  on  financial \nadministration and project management developed following Decree 17.11 \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n72.  Cofinancing. Effectiveness of the loan agreement will be subject to confirmation of \ngrant approval from Sida. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n73.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,969,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Health Care in the Central Highlands \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $5,579,000, \nto the Government of Viet Nam for the Health Care in the Central Highlands \nProject to be provided by the Government of Sweden on a grant basis.  \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n16 December 2003 \n \n                                                 \n11 Government Decree No. 17/2001/ND-CP on the \u201cIssuance of the Regulation on the Management and Utilization of Official \nDevelopment Assistance\u201d.  \n ", "18   Appendix 1 \n \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Project Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions \n(Verifiable Indicators)  Mechanisms \n \n1.

The Central Highlands have benefited from significant support from the international \ncommunity. In the past 10 years, international support has averaged about $1,000,000 a year in \nGia  Lai  and  Dak  Lak,  $500,000  in  Kon  Tum,  and  $600,000  in  Lam  Dong.  Table  A2.1 \nsummarizes major international support to the region. \n \n2.  The World Bank\u2019s National Health Support Project has helped three provinces. The \nproject provided support to all districts in Gia Lai and Kon Tum, with substantial support to \ndistrict health centers, commune health centers, and intercommune polyclinics. The World Bank \nProject will also support 12 out of 17 districts in Dak Lak. The civil works support upgraded the \nsurgical,  emergency,  sterilization,  and  x-ray  units  of  the  district  health  centers.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and World Bank supported Dak Lak and Lam Dong through the Population \nand Family Health Project. Support covered fifteen districts in Dak Lak and seven in Lam Dong. \nThe project provided civil works and equipment focused on strengthening reproductive health \nservices. \n \n3.  An  Australian  government  project  to  strengthen  health  services  provided  extensive \nsupport to provincial health services, 3 districts, and 16 communes in Gia Lai province. The \nprimary focus of the project is on maternal and childcare, providing support through equipment \nand training at the commune, district, and provincial levels. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF) has been active in providing support to primary health care at the commune level \nthrough  equipment,  training,  and  community-based  monitoring.  Germany  provided  major \nsupport to help establish Kon Tum's provincial hospital. \n \n4.  At least 13 international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have health projects in \nthe Central Highlands.

Introduction  \n \n1.  The Central Highlands are one of the poorest regions in Viet Nam.1 They lag behind \nnational averages in terms of human development, measured both by the access to services \nand social sector outcomes. In the health sector, the Central Highlands have fallen behind other \nregions and will require substantial targeted investments to improve health outcomes, especially \nfor the poor. This appendix reviews health outcomes in the Central Highlands, utilization of \nservices, and the health system.   \n \nB.  Health Outcomes \n \n2.  Health outcomes in the Central Highlands are well below the national average because \nservice quality is poor, health knowledge is limited, and utilization of services is infrequent. \nBurden of disease is a measure of the human cost of ill health measured in disability-adjusted \nlife years.2 Table A3.1 compares burden of disease estimates and other key health outcomes \nbetween the Central Highlands and the country as a whole.  \n \nTable A3.1: Burden of Disease in the Central Highlands \nInfant  HIV Positive \nTotal DALYs  % of DALYs  Malaria Cases \n  Mortality (per  Persons per \nlost per capita  lost to CNPM  per 100,000 \n1,000 births)  100,000 \nViet Nam  .18  29  36.7  332  56 \nCentral Highlands  .28  53  64.4  1,369  21 \n  Gia Lai  .30  63  73.5  1,855  19 \n  Kon Tum  .37  65  62.5  1,918  15 \n  Dak Lak  .27  50  57.3  1,384  22 \n  Lam Dong  .22  41  23.8  694  23 \nDALYs = disability-adjusted life years, CNPM = communicable disease, nutrition problems, perinatal and \nmaternal conditions, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \nNote: DALYs are calculated per capita.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. Burden of disease is based on Viet Nam National Health Survey \n2001-02. Infant mortality is from the 1999 Population and Housing Census. Data on malaria and HIV is from 2001 \nofficial Ministry of Health Statistics.  \n \n3.  Two important facts are apparent. First, the Central Highlands have a substantially \nhigher burden of disease than the national average. Second, the Central Highlands is behind \nthe rest of the country in the epidemiological transition with the majority of deaths are still a \nresult of easily preventable health problems that have been largely controlled in other regions. \nAt a national level, burden of disease is slightly higher for men than women, but in the Central \nHighlands,  women  have  50%  higher  burden  of  disease  than  men.  This  is  largely  due  to \nreproductive health problems that can be addressed with low-cost interventions. \n \n4.   The infant mortality rate (IMR) is often used as an overall proxy for health outcomes \nbecause infants are sensitive to preventable health problems. In the Central Highlands, the IMR \nis 64 per 1,000 live births, compared to 37 for all of Viet Nam. The mortality rate for children \nunder age 5 mirrors this trend. Analysis of the burden of disease data shows that children in the \n                                                 \n1  Using the General Statistic Office poverty line, 52% of the Central Highlands population was poor in 1998 compared to 37% at the \nnational level. Using the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs poverty line, poverty was 17% in 2002, compared to 13% at \nthe national level.   \n2  Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are a commonly used measurement of the burden disease. They estimate the number \nyears of life lost due to premature death or disability compared to the potential life expectancy.  \n ", "22 Appendix 3 \nCentral Highlands are vulnerable to communicable diseases, poor perinatal conditions, and are \nprobably weakened by malnutrition.  \n \n5.  Statistics on specific health problems tell a similar story. The region has by far the \nhighest rate of malaria in the country. Only 5% of Viet Nam's population lives in the Central \nHighlands, but the region accounts for 22% of total malaria cases. The region has a significantly \nlower rate of infection with HIV/AIDS3 and its isolation offers it some protection from the spread \nof this deadly disease. However knowledge of HIV/AIDS is also lower in the Central Highlands \nand  experience  shows  that  isolated  communities  can  be  at  particular  risk  from  rapid \ntransmission (main text, para. 40).   \n  \nC.  Utilization of Health Services \n \n6.  A significant proportion of the Central Highlands population is not using existing health \nservices. The low demand for health care is the result of both economic and cultural barriers to \nservice. By many measures, the utilization of health services in the Central Highlands is below \nthe national average. At the primary level, contact rates are about half the national level. \n \n7.  The contact rate for hospitals (primarily district health centers) is closer to the national \naverage. In the Central Highlands, the contact rate is 0.5, compared to the national rate of 0.7. \nDespite the fact this is below the national average, it suggests that residents in the Central \nHighlands rely on district health centers as their first point of contact. This is likely to be due to \nthe convenience of the district health centers, the higher quality of services, and the fact that \nmany patients avoid the health care system until they become very ill. Lower hospital utilization \nrates in the Central Highlands as a whole come as a result of infrequent use by the poor; the \nnon-poor have similar utilization patterns to their counterparts in the rest of the country.  \n \nTable A3.2: Utilization of Health Services in the Central Highlands \n  Received no  No health worker  Total contact rate  Contact rate for \nprenatal care (%)  at delivery (%)  for health  hospitals  \nservices \nViet Nam  17.9  17.6  0.7   10.8 \nCentral Highlands  37.9  40.4  0.5     7.2 \n  Gia Lai  62.7  63.3  \u2014  \u2014 \n  Kon Tum  34.2  39.6  \u2014  \u2014 \n  Dak Lak  33.7  45.4  \u2014  \u2014 \n  Lam Dong  21.6  62.5  \u2014  \u2014 \nNote: Contact rates are not available at the provincial level.  \nSource: Staff calculations based on Viet Nam National Health Survey 2001-02.  \n \n8.  The population is less likely to utilize specialized health services such as hospital care \nand  reproductive  health  services.  For  example,  only  62%  pregnant  women  in  the  Central \nHighlands received antenatal care, compared to the national average of 82%. Likewise, 40% of \nwomen said their most recent delivery was unattended. This is more than double the national \naverage. Table A3.2 compares the use of health care services in the Central Highlands with the \nrest of Viet Nam.  \n \n9.  Economic barriers. Accessing health care is never free and in many cases the cost \n(both  direct  costs  such  as  fees  for  services  and  medication  and  indirect  costs  such  as \ntransportation and opportunity cost of time spent seeking care) is more than many households \ncan  afford.  Participatory  poverty  analyses  have  shown  that  the  cost  of  health  care  is  a \n                                                 \n3  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n ", "  Appendix 3  23\nsignificant barrier for the poor.4 In the absence of a well-established insurance system, health \nexpenditures can be unpredictable and serious health problems can lead to impoverishment. An \nestimated 15% of households in the Central Highlands spend more than 10% of their annual \nhousehold budgets on health care. This is similar to the national proportion. On average, around \n6.3% of household expenditures are for health care in the Central Highlands compared to the \nnation average of 6.9%.  \n \n10.  Viet Nam is in the process of expanding targeted health insurance for the poor. The \nGovernment  is  currently  implementing  Prime  Minister's  Decision  139,5  which  will  establish \nHealth Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP), reduce vulnerability of the poor, and increase the \naffordability of health care. If the provinces have the capacity to implement Decision 139, the \nCentral Highlands will benefit substantially. Under current regulations, the potential coverage of \nthe  HCFP  in  the  Central  Highlands  is  39%, compared  to  24%  of  the  national  population. \nCoverage will range from 23% in Lam Dong to 51% in Kon Tum. Dak Lak will have the largest \nnumber of beneficiaries in the country, with more than 835,000 people eligible. \n \n11.  Initial estimates show that introducing Decision 139 has led to a substantial increase in \nthe utilization of health services, particularly among the poor. For example, inpatient admissions \nin Dak Lak increased by 13% in the first 6 months in 2003 compared to the same period in \n2002. The number of inpatient days increased by 42% in district health centers during the same \nperiod, indicating an unmet demand for hospital care.  \n \n12.  Cultural  Barriers.  Beyond  the  economic  barriers,  many  households  are  effectively \nalienated from the health care system for cultural reasons. Ethnic minorities account for 33% of \nthe  Central  Highlands  population,  compared  to  14%  at  the  national  level.  Many  ethnic \nminorities, particularly women (who are typically responsible for household members seeking \nhealth  services),  do  not  speak  Vietnamese.  Participatory  assessment  shows  that  ethnic \nminorities face language and cultural gaps in accessing health services. \n \n13.  At  present,  there  is  little  hard  data  on  the  ethnicity  of  health  providers.  Anecdotal \nevidence shows that some health providers are members of ethnic minority groups, particularly \nat the lower levels, but their representation is significantly below their share of the population. \n \nD.  The Health System \n \n14.  Coverage and Quality. The coverage of the health system in the Central Highlands is \ninadequate. In terms of quantity\u2014for example, the number of commune health centers\u2014the \nregion is close to national averages. Surveys show that the type and quality of equipment in \ncommune health centers in the Central Highlands is close to the national standards, and in \nsome cases, it even surpasses other regions. The problem appears to be quality of care. Low \npopulation density means that health services are further from residents than they are in other \nregions. Table A3.3 summarizes the coverage of public health services in the region.  \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2000. Voices of the Poor.

The health system in the Central Highlands also has a limited referral system, despite its \nfunctioning primary health network. An assessment of intercommune polyclinics and district \nhealth centers show that these first levels of referral often lack basic equipment and supplies \nand fall well short of Ministry of Health norms.  \n \n16.  Health staff is particularly important in ensuring that equipment is properly used, drugs \nproperly administrated, and protocols followed. However, attracting and retaining high quality \nhealth staff in the Central Highlands, particularly in rural areas, is difficult. The Central Highlands \nhave a similar proportion of doctors to the rest of the country, but they tend to be located at \nmajor hospitals. The number of other health personnel in the region, particularly nurses and \npharmacists, is significantly lower.  \n \n17.  While the number of medical personnel per capita is similar in the Central Highlands to \nthe national averages, the level of training of health personnel in the Central Highlands is below \nthe national average, in some cases far below. The Viet Nam National Health Survey (2001-02) \nshows, for example, that commune health centers have the equipment to deal with routine \nmaternal cases but staff responses to hypothetical cases show that their level of training is well \nbelow the national average.  \n \n18.  The  opportunities  for  training  in  the  Central  Highlands  are  relatively  limited,  further \nlimiting the quality of health care. Even in remote regions, there is the need for some specialists \nin keys areas such as anesthesia, basic surgery, and obstetric care. The total number of \nspecialists per capita (with postgraduate training) is only one fourth the national average. Unlike \nthe rest of the country, this number has not increased in the past decade. Likewise, the number \nof university-trained nurses in the Central Highlands is about half of the national average. The \nnumber of assistant physicians, who often receive additional training and become physicians, is \nalso low at 4.5 per 10,000 compared with 5.9 per 10,000 at the national level. This limits the \npool of training physicians.  \n \n19.  Health  System  Financing.  The  overall  financing  of  the  Central  Highlands\u2019  health \nsystem is inadequate. Despite having lower health outcomes than most regions in the country, \nthe  level  of  public  financing  is  average.  In  2001,  government  spending  on  health  care \nnationwide was D84,000 per capita. Public spending in the Central Highlands ranged from \nD51,000 per capita in Dak Lak to D166,000 per capita in Kon Tum. Although this is slightly \nabove the national average, it does not correspond to the health care needs of the region.  \n \n20.  Health  financing  in  Viet  Nam  depends  largely  on  private  payments,  even  to  public \nproviders. The Central Highlands fall significantly behind other regions in terms of household \nexpenditures. On average in 2001, out-of-pocket expenditures, including related expenditures \nsuch as travel, account for 6.3% of total household expenditure in the Central Highlands, \n ", "  Appendix 3  25\ncompared to the national average of 6.9%. However, incomes are below the national average \nso  the  private  payment  to  the  health  system  is  only  D150,000  per  capita  in  the  Central \nHighlands, compared to the national average of D193,000.  \n \n21.  Figure A3.1 shows total spending on health care, including both public and private \nspending, compared with IMR. The two bold lines represent the national averages for IMR and \nhealth expenditure. There is a clear relationship between spending on health care and IMR. \nProvinces with lower spending on health care tend to have higher IMR. The top left quadrant, \nwith  higher-than-average  IMR  and  lower-than-average  health  spending,  includes  all  of  the \nprovinces in the Central Highlands with the exception of Lam Dong. Public spending cannot \ncompensate for the low level of private spending on health.  \n \nFigure A3.1: Health Expenditure and Infant Mortality Rate \n \n \no Kon Tum\n80 \no Gia Lai\n70 \n00  oo   o o\n0\n1, 60  o o Dac Lac\ner  o o o\np 50  o\ne  o o\ny Rat 40  o  o o o oo o oooo o o o\nt o o\nali 30  ooo ooooooo\nt\nor o o ooo Lam Dooonog o o o o\nM o o o\nnt  20  o o o o \na\nnf 10  o o \nI\n0 \n0  80  160 240 320 400 480 560 \nHealth Care Spending (D1,000)   \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n22.  Decision 139 will substantially increase health care spending in the region. With proper \nimplementation, Central Highlands provinces will be among the largest beneficiaries of the \nHCFP. Aggregate health spending will increase by D28,000 per capita, with the poor directly \nbenefiting  from  the  influx  of  funds.  Health  care  financing  will  become  substantially  more \nprogressive, and this will likely significantly help health outcomes. \n ", "26 Appendix 4 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  Project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  The  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) is based on field visits during project preparation, review of \nliterature and government guidelines, discussions with staff at implementing agencies and other \norganizations, and consultant reports.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project will support the health system in the provinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon \nTum, and Lam Dong. The Project supports the upgrading of facilities and equipment, training, a \nhealth information system, and implementation of Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP). The \nProject will improve the handling of medical waste in the Central Highlands region. The Project \nwill  safeguard  the  environment  and  mitigate  potential  negative  effect  by  upgrading  waste \nmanagement  facilities  to  meet  government  standards.  All  civil  works  will  include  capital \ninvestments to improve management of medical solid wastes, including infectious, clinical, and \ntoxic wastes, as well as nonhazardous domestic waste and wastewater.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The Central Highlands border on the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Cambodia, \nand are equivalent to about one-fifth of Viet Nam\u2019s total land area. The region is mountainous, \nwith an average height of 800-1,000 meters above sea level. The region experiences severe \nshortages of water in the dry season (January to May). On average, only 50-70% of people \nhave access to clean water. Use of septic latrines is low. The economy is based on agriculture, \nwhich accounts for around 70% of regional gross domestic project (GDP). Residents cultivate \nrice, corn, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and commercial crops such as rubber and coffee. Soil in \nthe Central Highlands is suitable for fruit trees and medicinal herbs.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n   \n1.   Civil Works \n \n4.  The Project supports civil works to upgrade district health centers (DHCs) and provincial-\nlevel  preventive  health  facilities;  social  disease  centers;  information,  education,  and \ncommunication (IEC) centers; and secondary medical schools. Most of these health facilities are \nlocated in urban areas and on plains or plateaus. They are located at ground level, with \nreasonable potential for natural drainage. \n \n5.  District Health Centers. DHCs include inpatient, diagnostic, and treatment facilities, as \nwell as other clinical support facilities. A DHC is typically located in an urban area with access to \nexisting water and electricity supplies. The DHCs typically have four to six buildings in an area \nof about three hectares and produce 20 to 40 kilograms (kg) of medical waste per month. The \nProject supports civil works for 15 DHCs. This includes major construction (approximately 2,350 \nsquare meters [m2] each) of four DHCs in Iapa (Gia Lai), Ngoc Hoi (Kon Tum), and Lam Ha and \nDi Linh (Lam Dong). Nine DHCs will be upgraded with civil works of 1,000 m2 or less. Support \nfor improved solid waste disposal, as well as water and sanitation systems, will be provided for \nall of these DHCs. In addition, the Project will upgrade both solid waste disposal and water and \nsanitation systems in two DHCs that will not receive any other civil works. A budget of $105,000 \n ", "  Appendix 4  27\nhas been allocated per DHC to cover the costs of improving solid waste management, water, \nand sanitation systems.   \n \n6.  Provincial Preventive Health Center. The Project will support civil works for a new \nprovincial preventative health center (2,000 m2) in Da Lat in Lam Dong province. Solid clinical \nwaste will be taken to the provincial hospital for disposal based on government standards. The \nprovincial preventive health center will be linked to the city\u2019s water and sanitation systems. \n \n7.  Social Disease Center. A social disease center (SDC) is a separate facility handling a \nrange  of  issues  pertaining  to  social  disease.  The  Project  will  support  for  SDCs  in  three \nprovinces, covering an area of 1,000m2 each in (i) Kon Tum (Kon Tum); (ii) Buon Ma Thuot (Dak \nLak); and (iii) Da Lat (Lam Dong). Solid clinical waste will be taken to nearby provincial hospitals \nfor disposal. The SDC will be linked to the city\u2019s water and sanitation system. The Project will \ntrain staff at SDCs to handle medical waste. \n \n8.  Information, Education, and Communication Center. IEC centers are small office \nbuildings that may be separate facilities or part of larger health complexes. The Project supports \ncivil works (250m2 each) for three IEC centers. The IEC centers generate no medical waste. \nThe centers will be linked to city water and sanitation systems.  \n \n9.  Secondary Medical School. The Project supports civil works for two secondary medical \nschools (about 3,000 m2 each) in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces. The school in Gia Lai will be \nupgraded in a new location, while the one in Dak Lak will remain at its current site. Schools will \nbe built closer to the provincial hospitals where clinical training will be undertaken. The schools \ndo not generate medical waste and will be linked to city water and sanitation systems.  \n \n2.  Other Project Components  \n \n10.  An annual 3-day training course on waste management will take place every year in \neach DHC to improve handling of medical waste. This course will focus on proper sorting, \nstoring, and disposal of potentially hazard waste, as well as instruction on government policy. \nGiven its importance, it will be offered every year to reinforce lessons and update staff on the \nlatest practices. Additional training may be offered, depending on the project-supported waste \nmanagement equipment. Other project components\u2014training, management supervision, and \nhealth financing\u2014are expected to have no marginal impact on the environment.  \n \nE.  Assessment and Recommendations  \n \n1.  Environmental Assessment \n \n11.  Medical  solid  waste\u2014glassware,  syringes,  dressings,  bandages,  plasters,  plastic \nsyringes, and test swabs\u2014accounts for 10-15% of hospitals\u2019 solid waste. Most health facilities \nhave limited resources for waste disposal. Health providers generally know to sort and separate \nmedical waste from conventional waste; however, there are problems with storage and disposal \nof hazardous materials. Medical waste is usually taken to landfill sites and mixed with other \nwaste or burned in the open air. Liquid clinical waste is discharged without proper treatment, \nand health centers lack basic wastewater facilities. Challenges to effective waste management \ninclude  (i)  inappropriate  technology,  (ii)  lack  of  training  and  awareness  among  staff,  (iii) \ngeographical remoteness of health centers, and (iv) high cost of treatment systems. \n \n ", "28 Appendix 4 \n12.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has increasingly recognized the importance of improving \nwaste management in the health sector and that the proper disposal of hazardous medical \nwaste is essential to avoiding adverse environmental and health impacts. In response to this \nchallenge, MOH has developed a series of regulations and a plan to improve the handling of \nmedical waste. The regulatory framework provides clear guidelines for proper medical waste \nmanagement and follows international practice.1 MOH is also in the process of finalizing a 10-\nyear master plan to improve medical waste management.2   \n \n2.  Recommendations \n \n13.  Because project activities are decentralized and need to be flexible, the Government will \nundertake the following four steps as part of the environmental review framework:  \n \n(i)  For each DHC, the Provincial Health Department will develop an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) focused specifically on medical waste management \nbefore  it  awards  contracts  for  civil  works.  The  outline  of  this  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n(ii)  The EMP will be submitted to MOH, other related government agencies, and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for review and concurrence. ADB will ensure \nthat the EMP is consistent with ADB's environmental policy.   \n(iii)  Provincial health departments will carry out site-specific IEEs based on a review \nof the EMP and local environmental conditions. The site-specific IEE will carefully \nexamine the environmental consequences of the proposed investment in waste \nmanagement and will make further recommendations. For sites that use medical \nwaste incinerators, special care will be taken to ensure that the engineering \nspecifications minimize harmful environmental impact. The IEE will be developed \naccording  to  ADB's  environmental  policy  and  will  (a)  identify  potential \nenvironmental  impacts,  including  both  indirect  and  cumulative  effects,  and \nassess their significance; (b) evaluate the cost effectiveness of the proposed \nEMP;  and  (c)  develop  appropriate  environmental  monitoring  plans  to  ensure \ncompliance.  The  IEE  will  follow  government  regulations  on  medical  waste \nmanagement and will be reviewed by ADB before civil works are approved.  \n(iv)  Hold site-specific public consultations with potentially affected groups on the IEE \nand the EMP before awarding civil works contracts. \n \n14.  Solid Waste The Project will emphasize the main principles of medical solid waste \nmanagement: minimizing the generation of solid waste, early separation of hazardous and \nnonhazardous waste at health facilities, safe storage of hazardous waste, and proper disposal. \nIt  will  support  continuous  management  training  for  health  care  staff  handling  waste  and \noperating  equipment.  The  Project  will  improve  the  current  management  of  infectious  and \nchemical  waste  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy.  The  Project  will  make  a  major \ncontribution to support implementation of the proposed National Master Plan for Health Care \nSolid Waste Treatment in the Central Highlands. \n \n15.  Each DHC will develop a site-specific EMP that is consistent with national regulations on \nmedical waste and with the Master Plan for Health Care Solid Waste Treatment. The local \nwaste management will also require approval by ADB with appropriate public consultation. The \n                                                 \n1 These principles are an integral part of Viet Nam's Regulation on Healthcare Waste Management, Minister's Decision No. \n2575/1999/Qd-BYT (27 August 1999).  \n2 The National Master Plan for Healthcare Solid Waste Treatment. The Ministry of Health plans to submit this master plan for \nGovernment approval before 31 December 2003.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  29\nlocal EMP will identify the DHC's procedures for identifying and separating medical waste from \nother waste, guidelines for transportation and storage, and final disposal. It will identify the roles \nof individual staff members within each DHC in managing medical waste, and will include a \ntraining plan for key staff.  \n \n17.  The summary IEE has identified four broad options that DHC have in disposing of \nhazardous medical waste: (i) transportation of medical waste for disposal at an approved and \ndedicated  disposal  facility  such  as  a  provincial  hospital);  (ii)  permanent  burial  in  specially \ndesigned, secure landfills; (iii) sterilization using either chemicals or steam; and (iv) incineration \nusing an approved incinerator designed to mitigate hazardous emissions.3  \n \n18.  The local authorities will have to consider several factors in their decision, including \ncapital and operation costs, the quality of the road network (for the transportation to a dedicated \nsite), the availability of necessary inputs, ease of implementation, training required, and public \nopinion. There is no perfect solution to the problem of medical waste: all options require trade-\noffs and carry risks.  \n \n19.  Liquid Waste The Project will support better liquid waste management at each DHC. \nTechnology  for  liquid  waste  disposal  will  vary  based  on  local  conditions  and  practices. \nDepending on the type of waste and the organisms in it, risk waste will be inactivated and \nrendered safe before final disposal. Liquid clinical waste normally comes from laboratories and \nutility rooms where chemical and active solutions are stored.  \n \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n20.  The  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  be  responsible  for  meeting \nGovernment  and  ADB  environmental  standards.  To  ensure  compliance,  a  domestic \nenvironmental specialist (4 person-months) will provide overall technical guidance and help \nprepare  detailed  civil  works  plans,  particularly  the  environmental  mitigation  component,  to \nensure that all relevant standards are met. \n \n21.  The key elements of this summary IEE and the proposed waste management plan are \nincluded as specific assurances in the loan agreement. This includes both the required actions \nin the waste management plan and financing of the associated recurrent costs. ADB will also \ninclude a specific assurance about submitting the National Master Plan for Health Care Solid \nWaste Treatment to the Government for approval.  \n \n22.  Monitoring will be mainstreamed, with each PPMU preparing semiannual updates on \ncompliance  environmental  standards  as  part  of  regular  reporting.  The  midterm  review  will \nprovide a detailed investigation of project compliance with environmental standards.  \n \nG.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n23.  Public consultation will continue throughout the project and will play an important role in \ndesign of civil works. The Government will provide information on the Project\u2019s environmental \nissues in a form and language suitable to the population. The environmental specialist will hold \nconsultations with relevant groups to explain the financial and nonfinancial costs and benefits of \nproposed measures to mitigate environmental harm caused by medical waste.  \n                                                 \n3  Both sterilization and incineration require the subsequent use of a landfill; however, this option does not generally require special \nhandling or facilities.  \n ", "30 Appendix 4 \n \nH.  Conclusion \n \n24.  The Project will help improve the environment by upgrading existing waste management \nfacilities to meet Government and ADB environmental standards. Both new and upgraded \nfacilities will include investment to improve medical solid waste management and wastewater \ndisposal. Based on the summary IEE, a detailed environmental impact assessment for the \nProject is not required. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  31\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.

Improving the health status of the people, especially the poor and disadvantaged, in the Central \nHighlands will require targeted intervention and subsidies to increase access to quality health services by lowering \ncosts. The public health system faces challenges in protecting and responding to the health needs of the poor and \ndisadvantaged. For instance, HIV/AIDSa poses a special risk to ethnic minority populations. While their relative \nisolation may offer some protection from infection, it may also prevent entry of programs and campaigns aimed at \neducation and prevention. The Central Highlands are at particular risk because of its close borders and trading \nactivities with Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The Project will address these and other \nconcerns through regional investment where the focus will be on four of the poorest provinces in the Central \nHighlands:  Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Lam Dong. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \nThematic Areas: Human Development/Gender and Development \nThe Project will improve the availability and appropriateness of quality health services, increase client affordability and \nutilization of health services, and strengthen the capacity of the public health system in the four central highland \nprovinces. From 1988 to 2002, poverty incidence for Viet Nam declined from 37% of the population to 29%, according \nto the international poverty line. However, in the Central Highlands, the poverty rate has remained constant at about \n52%. The Project will improve the health status of 4.4 million people. It will specifically target 3.2 million rural residents, \nincluding 1 million of the poorest and 1.5 million members of ethnic minorities.  \n \nThe poverty analysis includes a needs assessment that identifies (i) the existing burden of disease for the poor and \nethnic minorities; (ii) their ability to pay for proposed services supported by the Project; (iii) strategies to optimize their \nuse of the services; and (iv) the current capacity of the health system to effectively address their health needs. The \nanalysis also establishes cost-sharing mechanisms to enhance the sustainability of the regional health system within \nthe broader preventive and curative health system, and to improve the overall equity of health financing. Investments \nthat will be made are pro-poor, whereby the poor and disadvantaged groups benefit disproportionately. As a result of \nthis support, household budget for health care for approximately 220,000 people will drop below 10% of total \nexpenditure. The Project reduces risks that the poor and disadvantaged from becoming further marginalized by \nhelping to reduce their vulnerability to health-related shocks. \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis                                                                                                                             Yes \nParticipation strategy                                                                                                                             No \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted as part of the feasibility study. The study helped to identify key project \nstakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways in which they affect project feasibility and success. Primary \nstakeholders include selected staff from Ministry of Health, including 11 different departments and 2 different groups; \npeople\u2019s committees at different levels; representatives from the poor and more vulnerable groups, including ethnic \nminorities; and resettlement-affected persons. Secondary stakeholders may include mass organizations, relevant line \nministries, and the Ministry of Health.  \n \nThe analysis identified the need to integrate the community, especially women, into the project cycle. Success in \nreducing morbidity and mortality cannot be achieved solely through availability of health services. Public participation \nand involvement are essential elements of the health system strategy. Priority will be given to community involvement \nat all levels of the system, with increased attention to more direct participation in managing public services. Special \ninitiatives will be taken to involve people in community-based health insurance schemes. Community support\u2014 \nespecially among the poor, disadvantaged, and ethnic minority groups\u2014will be required (i) to help identify families in \nneed and (ii) to ensure their accessibility to special care. Women\u2019s participation will be central to programs focusing on \nmaternal and child health. Attitudes toward and knowledge of a particular health issue will determine the effectiveness \nof health services.

The Project will places a strong emphasis on community \nparticipation, and use of all partners in the community, particularly the private sector, to achieve an effective and \nefficient response to the unique needs of each community. Past experiences from community-based health education \nand training programs will be evaluated, and lessons learned will be incorporated into the Project where appropriate. \nTo ensure the sustainability of these initiatives, linkages will need to be strengthened and/or built between different \nlevels in the system. Three key areas of community participation has been identified: (i) the health system needs to \nshow more relevance of their services to the community at the district and commune levels; (ii) the community\u2019s role at \nthe district and commune levels needs to be expanded in terms of technical and financial aspects, so to generate \nownership and involvement; and (iii) measures are needed to promote and strengthen community involvement in \nhealth  programs  and  services.  Sufficient  investment  will  be  made  to  improve  the  use  of  behavior  change \ncommunications (BCC) to directly improve the effectiveness of health services, especially for women, whose well-\nbeing and further involvement is pivotal to overall health of children and family. \nD.

Introduction \n \n1.  An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to highlight the project \nbenefits to ethnic minority communities in the Central Highlands. It has been developed to \nensure  that  ethnic  minorities  have  access  to  affordable,  high-quality  services  in  a  more \nequitable health system in the four project provinces. \n   \nB.  Background  \n \n2.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  4.4  million  people  in  the  region,  including  1.5  million \nmembers of ethnic minority groups. \u201cEthnic minority\u201d refers to groups different from the majority \nethnic group, the Kinh. The Central Highlands are equivalent to about one-fifth of Viet Nam\u2019s \ntotal land area, and are one of the areas of greatest ethnic diversity. Minority groups represent \nabout 14% of Viet Nam\u2019s total population, and about 28% of the total poor. About 33% of the \ntotal population in the Central Highlands are ethnic minorities: 43% in Gia Lai, 52% in Kon Tum, \n29% in Dak Lak, and 23% in Lam Dong. \n \n3.  In Viet Nam, a major challenge for the health system is to reduce the inequalities in the \nuse of health services (Table A6.1). The burden of disease amongst ethnic minorities is much \nhigher than that amongst majority ethnic groups. Provinces with high concentrations of ethnic \nminorities usually have high infant and child mortality rates. Ethnic minorities are less likely to \nseek health care than the Kinh because of (i) high cost and low coverage of health insurance; \n(ii) poor quality of services in rural areas; (iii) little motivation/incentive for health care workers to \nserve the poor; (iv) geographical remoteness; (v) lack of gender-specific considerations; and (vi) \nlanguage and cultural barriers. Ethnic minorities have not been able to capture proportionate \nbenefits from health services for these reasons.  \n \nTable A6.1: Health Indicators for the Central Highlands \n \nIndicators  Viet  Central  Ethnic Minorities \nNam  Highlands  in the Central \nHighlands \nInfant Mortality Rate, Under 1 (per 1,000 live births,  36.7  64.4  40.0 \n1999) \nChild Malnutrition Under Age 5 (%, 2000)  33.8  40.9  41.0 \nMaternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000 live births, 1995)  95.0   170.0a  200-300 \nSupervised Delivery (%)  82.4  59.6  30.0 \nHome Delivery (%)  23.3  55.1  83.0 \nTetanus Toxoid Vaccination (%)  87.1  69.5  44.0 \na 2001 estimates.  \nNote: All figures are from year 2001, unless otherwise indicated. \nSource: Project situational analysis, 2003.  \n \n \n4.  HIV/AIDS1 poses a special risk to ethnic minority populations (main text, para. 40). The \nrecent Viet Nam National Health Survey (2001-02) showed that about 86% of women who have \never married knew what HIV/AIDS is, as compared to the national average of 95%. The Central \nHighlands are at particular risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS because of their close borders and \nfrequent trade with Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "34 Appendix 6 \n \nC.  Legal Framework and Principles \n \n5.  The EMDP for the Project is based on Vietnamese laws and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) policy on indigenous peoples . ADB policy aims to protect ethnic minorities from the \nadverse impacts of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from development \nprojects and programs. The Project will create favorable conditions for improved access to \nhealth services. This will enable ethnic minority families to seek timely and quality health care. \n \n6.  The Government recognizes ethnic minorities as poor and underprivileged groups. The \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) sets 11 goals, 7 of which \ndeal directly with issues of gender and ethnic minorities: (i) achieve better education for all; (ii) \nreach gender equality and empower women; (iii) reduce infant and child mortality; (iv) improve \nmaternal health; (v) combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other communicable diseases; (vi) reduce \nvulnerability; and (vii) eradicate poverty and preserve ethnic minority culture.  \n \n7.  A recent government policy initiative, Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 139,2 is designed to \nensure  access  to  basic  health  care  for  the  poor.  The  policy  specifically  identifies  ethnic \nminorities in the Central Highlands as primary beneficiaries. Under Decision 139, the provincial \npeople\u2019s committees will establish Health Care Funds for the Poor to subsidize the cost of \nservices at public health facilities for targeted beneficiaries (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \nD.  Project Benefits \n \n8.  The  Project  fully  mainstreams  ethnic  minorities\u2019  concerns  into  its  design.  Specific \nactivities are incorporated into the designed health interventions to ensure that ethnic minorities \nshare proportionately in project benefits. The Project aims to (i) improve and raise the health \nstatus of ethnic minority families by improving availability of and accessibility to high-quality \nhealth services; (ii) encourage and involve the participation of ethnic minority communities in \nhealth activities, ensure direct benefits to ethnic minority communities in health projects, and \ncreate conditions for equitable and sustainable development; (iii) support the health system to \nimprove and increase the capability to provide culturally-sensitive health services and meet \neffectively the health needs of ethnic minority groups; and (iv) continue to reduce financial \nbarriers to services for ethnic minority communities.  \n \n9.  Specific  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minority  groups  benefit \nproportionately. Specific activities to increase access to improved health services for ethnic \nminorities include:  \n(i)  Upgrading  of  facilities  and  new  civil  works  will  provide  adequate  visual  and \nauditory privacy for patients, especially for 800,000 ethnic minority women.  \n(ii)  Priority  will  be  given  to  health  topics  that  disproportionately  affect  ethnic \nminorities at project-financed facilities. \n(iii)  Health information materials will be more culturally compatible, the use of visual \nand  audio  aids  will  be  encouraged,  and  collaboration  with  local  mass \norganizations, such as the Women\u2019s Union, will be sought.  \n(iv)  HIV/AIDS awareness programs will be integrated into training programs in a \nmanner that is culturally sensitive to ethnic minorities. \n(v)  Full incorporation of special ethnic minority needs into the development of new \nmaterials through extensive consultation with ethnic minority groups.  \n                                                 \n2  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on Health Care for the Poor. \n ", "  Appendix 6  35\n(vi)  Cultural  training  for  health  personnel.  Health  providers  will  be  trained  to \nrecognize local knowledge and understand health-seeking behaviors of ethnic \nminorities, including the use of traditional medicine, local reproductive health, and \nsafe motherhood practices. \n \n10.  Focused interventions will ensure proportionate ethnic minority representation in the \nhealth care system, and in training courses for skills development. These include:  \n(i)  Measures  to  increase  and  retain  the  number  of  ethnic  minority  staff  by  (a) \nrecruiting more ethnic minority staff from the Central Highlands, and (b) capacity \nbuilding in health issues that disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. \n(ii)  Adequate  opportunities  to  participate  in  training  courses  offered  though  the \nProject by relaxing entry standards for ethnic minorities.  \n(iii)  The following targets are specified for training courses financed by the Project: \n(a)  50% of postgraduate degree places will be reserved for candidates from \nethnic minority groups.  \n(b)  40% of the places on short-term training courses will be reserved for field \nworkers from ethnic minority groups. \n(c)  20%  of  medical  doctors  who  receive  training  will  come  from  ethnic \nminority groups.  \n \n11.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  costs  of  seeking  health  services  for  ethnic  minority \ncommunities by supporting the implementation of Decision 139. Emphasis is placed on using \nsupplementing  government  funds  to  cover  ethnic  minority  families  in  the  region.  Capacity \nbuilding to implement Decision 139 will ensure that health services are culturally appropriate, \nand that health information materials are available in the local language. A monitoring system \nwill work to ensure the collection of information disaggregated by ethnicity.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the EMDP have been integrated \ninto the overall arrangements and total budget of the Project as ethnic minorities are identified \nas primary beneficiaries. Each medical facility shall have at least one staff member aware of the \ntraditional ethnic minority health behaviors and practices. The provincial project management \nunit (PPMU) will have at least one member trained and able to manage specific ethnic minority \nissues. A domestic social development specialist will be hired for 6 person-months over the \nperiod of the Project to help develop implementation guidelines for the EMDP. The specialist will \nwork closely with the health specialists for the Project.  \n \n13.  The monitoring of the EMDP will be part of the overall system for the Project. Ethnic \nminority  beneficiaries  will  be  involved  in  designing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  health \nservices. The midterm review will pay special attention to ethnic minority groups, and progress \nreports will include updates on ethnic minorities, tracking any change in access and utilization of \nhealth  care.  Affordability  and  appropriateness  of  services  and  care  will  also  be  recorded. \nAdjustments, if necessary, will be made during the project to better meet ethnic minority needs. \n ", "36 Appendix 7 \nGENDER STRATEGY \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project provides significant health benefits for 2.2 million women in the Central \nHighlands, including 800,000 ethnic minority women. Gender issues have been fully integrated \ninto the project design, with consideration given to gender-specific health concerns. The Project \nemphasizes women\u2019s health, particularly reproductive health, obstetrics, gynecological care, \nand maternal and child health. Investments made in women\u2019s health will also have a positive \nimpact on the welfare of the family and child. A gender strategy has been prepared to ensure \nthat  women  will  have increased  access  to and  utilization  of  affordable,  high-quality  health \nservices. The gender strategy is based on the situational analysis and assessment prepared for \nthe  Project,  and  in  accordance  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment.  \n \nB.  Burden of Disease \n \n2.  About 50% of the population in the Central Highlands is female and disproportionately \nburdened by health problems. The burden of disease for females of reproductive age (15-44) is \nmore than 200 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)1 in all four provinces, compared to the \nnational average of 144 per 1,000 persons. In the Central Highlands, the burden is greater for \nwomen than for men whereas in the country as a whole, the burden of disease is similar for men \nand women. In Kon Tum, the figure is close to 230 DALYs (290 for women and 172 for men). \nThe burden of disease for women from the Central Highlands is twice that of the average \nVietnamese woman from the same age group. For men of the same age group, the burden of \ndisease is slightly higher in the Central Highlands than Viet Nam. \n \n3.  For women in the Central Highlands, especially ethnic minority women, a high burden of \ndisease is associated with (i) household poverty and poor living conditions; (ii) lack of knowledge, \nmaterials, and information about women\u2019s and children\u2019s health, and about the need to seek timely \nemergency care; (iii) a high birth rate; (iv) low social stature for women and limited ability to make \ndecisions; (v) differences in language and culture between health service users and providers; and \n(vi) cost of health services. Although there is little concrete data, participatory assessments also \nindicate that gender-based violence is a major health concern for women.2 \n \n1.  Women\u2019s Health Seeking Behavior \n \n4.  Women\u2019s health-seeking behavior and fertility decisions are influenced by crosscutting \nfactors such as gender, culture, tradition, ethnicity, and access.3 For instance, gynecological \nexaminations, prenatal visits, and delivery in the presence of a qualified medical worker are not \nconsidered important reproductive health practices. In 2000, about 65% of births in the Central \nHighlands were attended by a trained attendant, compared to 92% nationwide. About 45% of \nwomen in the region received prenatal care in 2000, compared to 70% nationally.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Burden of disease analysis is a tool that enables the total morbidity and mortality of a community to be expressed as one \nmeasure\u2014a disability-adjusted life year (DALY). The analysis expresses (i) morbidity in terms of years that have been lost \nthrough disability due to contracting or living with a certain disease, and (ii) mortality in terms of years lost because of premature \ndeath from disease.  \n2  ADB. 2002. Women in Viet Nam: Country Briefing Paper.  \n3  ADB. 2001. A Study of the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n ", "  Appendix 7  37\n5.  Many women believe childbirth is a natural phenomenon and pay little attention to safe \nmotherhood care. A lack of awareness about safe motherhood practices, low education levels, \nand the absence of trained birth attendants during delivery to recognize and treat complications \nresult in high levels of maternal mortality. Maternal mortality among ethnic minority women may \nbe nearly three times higher than that for women from the dominant ethnic group, the Kinh. The \ngender  and  ethnicity  of  medical  staff  and  lack  of  privacy  at  health  centers  also  affect \nreproductive health practices, awareness about HIV/AIDS4, and use of contraception.5  \n \n2.  Opportunity Cost of Seeking Health Services \n \n6.  The opportunity cost of seeking health care is high for the poor, and prevents them from \nutilizing  high-quality  health  care.6  Many  women  often  lack  control over  household  income. \nInsufficient time and money limit their ability to make timely decisions about health care for \nthemselves and their children. Heavy domestic and productive workloads also prevent poor \nwomen  from  seeking  early  health  care  and  treatment.  With  an  increase  in  economic \nopportunities, the opportunity cost of inactivity is too high for poor women, especially for ethnic \nminority women. Based on the 1992-1993 and 1997-1998 Viet Nam Living Standard Surveys, \npoor pregnant women and mothers with children under 12 months of age usually work longer \nhours in the labor market than their non-poor counterparts. Pregnant women and mothers with \nhigher incomes work less and have a greater ability to take time off to seek health services. For \nethnic minority women in the Central Highlands, opportunity costs are much higher.  \n \nC.  Gender and the Public Health Sector \n \n1.  Division of Labor \n \n7.  More than half of the labor force in the public health sector in the Central Highlands is \ncomprised of women, with the largest in Lam Dong at 63%. In Gia Lai and Kon Tum, about 59% \nof the labor force in the public health sector for each of the provinces are women. In Dak Lak, \nthe estimate is 60%. The gender division of labor within the public health sector is clearly \ndefined based on qualifications and professional skill. Female health workers usually have fewer \nqualifications, and work as nurses, midwives, or administrative staff. In Kon Tum, about 78% of \nuntrained staff, 61% of those with lower secondary education, and 67% of those with primary \nschool education are women. About 13% of health workers with postgraduate degrees and 26% \nof doctors are women.  \n \n8.  Further education and skills training are limited for female health workers because of (i) \nlong distances to training centers, (ii) high costs of training, (iii) inability to pass entry-level \nexaminations, and (iv) household duties and responsibilities. Female health workers often rely \non family assistance or preferential quotas to further their education and/or improve their skills. \nThere are few incentives for female health workers, especially female doctors specialized in \nobstetrics, to work in remote health facilities. While unmarried women worry about not finding \nsuitable spouses in remote areas, married women are more concerned about the quality of life \nand education for their families in isolated areas.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n5  Population Council. 1999.

There are much fewer women than men in health services management positions or \npolitical leadership roles. Of the 17 district health centers in Kon Tum, only 2 have female \ndirectors, and about 30% of departments and wards in Kon Tum have female deans/managers. \nThere are no women on the board of the Provincial Public Health Service.  \n \n10.  The primary health care committee (PHCC) is a multisector committee established in the \nprovincial health system.7 The Women\u2019s Union is one of its members, with others from local \norganizations. The PHCC advises the Provincial People\u2019s Committee (PPC) on implementing, \nformulating, organizing, and supervising vertical programs and health plans at the community \nlevel. The PHCC helps to encourage people\u2019s participation in a number of health campaigns, \ncoordinates other sector activities in implementing health plans, and selects public information \nfor health subjects. The head of the PHCC is the vice chairman of the PPC, with the director of \nthe health center as deputy head. \n \nD.  Project Benefits \n11.  The Project fully mainstreams gender concerns into its design to ensure that women \nshare proportionately in project benefits. The upgrading of facilities, capacity building of staff, \nand development of behavior change communication (BCC) materials will strengthen the health \ncare capacity to better respond to the needs of women and understand their health-seeking \nbehavior.  Health  care  interventions  will  improve  the  health  status  of  women  by  removing \nbarriers to access, especially amongst ethnic minority women in the Central Highlands. Nearly 1 \nmillion  women  of  reproductive  age  reside  in  the  Central  Highlands.  Improved  access  to \nreproductive health services will prevent half of the current maternal deaths per year, and will \nincrease the proportion of deliveries with prenatal care. The Project will significantly reduce the \nburden  of  disease  for  women\u2014particularly  problems  nutrition  and  infection\u2014and  will  help \nincrease women\u2019s social contribution to their families and communities.  \n \n12.  Specific project activities include \n(i)  Upgrading  facilities  and  building  new  ones  to  provide  adequate  visual  and \nauditory privacy for patients, especially ethnic minority women.  \n(ii)  Prioritizing BCC and social disease topics that disproportionately affect women. \n(iii)  Health promotion that focus on the needs and knowledge of men and women in a \nmore culturally sensitive manner. The Project encourages visual and audio aids, \nand collaborating with local organizations to deliver health messages. Project \nconstruction workers will be educated on how to prevent HIV/AIDS, for example. \n(iv)  Participation  and  consultation  with  women,  especially  from  ethnic  minority \ngroups, in the review and development of relevant health materials.  \n(v)  Training  of  health  providers  to  recognize  local  knowledge,  and  understand \nhealth-seeking behaviors of women, especially from ethnic minority groups. This \nincludes  understanding  the  use  of  traditional  medicine  and  treatments,  local \nreproductive health behaviors, and safe motherhood practices. \n \n13.  Within the public health sector, the division of labor is clearly defined. Leadership and \ninstitutional  capacity  of  women  in  managerial  positions  is  limited.  The  Project  will  support \nmedical  training  opportunities  for  women,  including  ethnic  minority  women,  in  the  Central \n                                                 \n7  Government Decree No. 163 (1988) instructs that all levels of government consult with the Women\u2019s Union regarding issues \nconcerning women and children. \n ", "  Appendix 7  39\nHighlands.  Such  interventions  will  ensure  their  representation  in  training  courses  for  skills \ndevelopment, and prevent them from becoming further marginalized in the health care system.  \n \n14.  Specific project activities include: \n(i)  Measures  to  increase the  numbers  of  female  medical  staff  involving  (a)  the \nrecruitment  of  more  women,  especially  ethnic  minorities  from  the  Central \nHighlands; and (b) capacity building in gender-specific health areas. \n(ii)  In  provinces  where  the  PPC  has  established  a  PHCC,  at  least  33%  of  its \nmembers will be women and should have an understanding of women\u2019s health \nand/or  ethnic  groups  health  concerns.  Greater  participation  by  the  Women\u2019s \nUnion will be encouraged. \n(iii)  Opportunity for women to participate in training courses supported by the Project:  \n(a) At least 33% of females, or a proportion equivalent to the number of female \nstaff currently employed at health centers, will be encouraged to participate in \nshort-term training courses. \n(b) Preference for training courses at provincial secondary medical schools will \nbe given to female applicants, especially from ethnic minority groups.   \n(c) At least 20% of trained medical doctors will be women. \n \n15.  The Project will also reduce the costs of seeking health care by supporting the health \ncare fund for the poor in the Central Highlands. The Project will support implementation of Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decision 139,8 which will significantly increase the affordability of health services for \nthe poor in the Central Highlands. Capacity building to implement Decision 139 will ensure that \nhealth services are culturally compatible, and that BCC materials on women\u2019s health topics, \nincluding gender-based violence, are available in the local language \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The gender strategy, including its monitoring and evaluation, is fully incorporated into all \nproject components. Implementation arrangements, including estimated costs for activities and \ncivil works of the gender strategy, are in line with arrangements for the rest of the project. Each \nmedical facility will have at least one staff member trained in women\u2019s health. The provincial \nproject management unit (PPMU) will have at least one female member trained in managing \ngender-specific  issues,  who  may  be  a  representative  from  the  provincial  Women\u2019s  Union. \nGender capacity building will be provided to project implementation staff as needed. A domestic \nsocial  development  specialist  will  be  recruited  for  6  person-months  to  help  develop \nimplementation guidelines for the gender strategy.  \n \n17.  In monitoring the gender strategy, special attention will be given to involving female \nbeneficiaries in the design and implementation of health services. Sex-disaggregated data\u2014\nand, where possible, data disaggregated by ethnic minority\u2014will be included in the reporting \nsystem.  The  midterm  review  will  consider  the  gender-specific  challenges  and  concerns  in \naccessing  appropriate  health  services.  Progress  reports  will  include  a  section  on  gender, \nhighlighting any changes in access and utilization of health care by women and men. The \nsection might also include observations on quality of training and appropriateness of equipment \nto women and men, especially from ethnic minority groups. Issues pertaining to affordability and \nappropriateness of health services, as well as care rendered, will be recorded and included \nwhere  appropriate.  Necessary  adjustments  will  be  made  during  the  project  to better  meet \ngender needs and promote the empowerment of women. \n                                                 \n8 Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg (15 October 2002) on Health Care for the Poor. \n ", "40   Appendix 8 \nSUMMARY OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project will finance 24 civil works subprojects on new and old sites. Four civil works \nsubprojects will require land acquisition and resettlement. One resettlement plan has been prepared \nfor the Project to safeguard the estimated 38 affected households, or approximately 200 persons \n(Supplementary Appendix A). Provisions have been included in the resettlement plan to help restore \nliving standards to preproject levels, if not better. As detailed designs are finalized and approved, the \nMinistry of Health (MOH) and provincial authorities will revise and update the resettlement plan.

An estimated 15.2 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired for the different subcomponents \n(Table A8.1). About 38 households will be affected, as well as some shops, all of which will be \nrelocated to nearby land. Some households will also lose agricultural land.  \n \nTable A8.1: Assessment of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nProject  No. and Location of Civil Works  Estimated  Estimated \nTown  Land  Total Impact \nConstruction at  Construction  Total  Acquisition  No. of  No. of \nNew Site  at Current  (ha)  Affected  Affected \nSite  HHs  Persons \nGia Lai  2  5  7  7.8  15  80 \nKon Tum  1  4  5  2.4  3  15 \nDak Lak  0  8  8  0.0  0  0 \nLam Dong  1  3  4  5.0  20  105 \nTotal  4  20  24  15.2  38  200 \nHa = hectares, HHs = households, and no = number. \nSource: Project situation analysis, field visits, confirmation faxes from project towns. \n \nC.  Legal Framework and Principles \n \n3.  The legal framework governing compensation and resettlement is based on Vietnamese \nlaws and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement dated 1995. Key \nVietnamese laws include the 1993 Land Law (14 July 1993, amended 2 December 1998), \nDecree  No.  22/1998/ND-CP  (24  April  1998),  and  provincial  decisions  that  guide  the \nimplementation of Decree No. 22. The 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration \nlaw, giving people access to land through user rights similar to private ownership. Decree No. \n22 regulates compensation for land the Government recovers for defense, security, national, \nand  public  interests.  The  policies  and  principles  adopted  for  the  Project  supersede  the \nprovisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists between \nADB policy and Vietnamese law. The Project will be bound by these principles and conditions. \n \n4.  The basic principles and approaches of ADB policy include (i) an effort to minimize land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; (ii) arrangements for compensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation; (iii) community participation, and full information for and consultation with affected \npersons  on  resettlement  and  compensation  options;  (iv)  fair  compensation  for  all  affected \npersons on losses, including assets and incomes; (v) resettlement planning and implementation \nintegral to project design; (vi) special measures to protect socially and economically vulnerable \ngroups; (vii) adequate support for affected persons in obtaining replacement land and income \n ", "  Appendix 8  41\nrestoration;  (viii)  effective  grievance  procedures;  and  (ix)  joint  monitoring  of  resettlement \nactivities by both the Government and ADB. \n \nD.  Compensation and Entitlements \n \n5.  The principles and objectives ensure that all affected persons are compensated for their \nlosses in such a way to help them improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards \nand income-earning capacity. Affected persons are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation, \nregardless of formal land title. Illegal households are not entitled to land compensation, but they \nare eligible for compensation for any investments made in the land. Those who encroach into the \nproposed area after the cut-off date (or completion of inventory of loss survey for each individual \ntown)1 are not entitled to compensation or rehabilitation. \n \n6.  Affected persons are entitled compensation for lost assets, incomes, and businesses at \nfull replacement cost at current market value, free from taxes, registration, and land transfer. \nCompensation will be land-based where possible. Any investments on the residential land, \nincluding trees and crops, will be compensated at replacement costs at current market value. If \naffected households are severely affected,2 they will be provided with transition allowances \n(including  subsistence,  transportation  costs,  business  assistance,  incentive  bonuses,  and \nspecial support for poor households). Rehabilitation measures will also be included to improve \nor at least maintain their pre-project living standards, incomes, and productive capacity.  \n \nE.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n7.  Gia Lai. Civil works in Gia Lai will require acquisition of 7.8 ha of land and will affect \napproximately 15 households. Approximately 10 households, including some shops, will be \nrelocated because the secondary medical school will move to a new site. About five households \nwill lose their agricultural landholdings because of construction of a district health center in Iapa \ndistrict. Compensation will be provided in land or cash for affected households. Resettlement \nsites have been identified and proposed.  \n \n8.  Kon Tum. The civil works in Kon Tum province will acquire 2.4 ha of land for new \nconstruction. The new district health center in Ngoc Hoi will be relocated closer to the border of \nCambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. An estimated 3 households will be \naffected by the land acquisition.  \n \n9.  Dak Lak. No land will be acquired to build provincial or district health facilities. If any \nland acquisition or resettlement is found necessary during implementation, a resettlement plan \nwill be prepared before affected persons or households are moved. \n \n10.  Lam  Dong.  The  Di  Linh  district  health  center  will  acquire  5  ha  from  a  district \ngovernment-owned  commercial  plantation,  and  will  cause  the  relocation  of  20  farming \nhouseholds. These households are employed by the plantation, and live in old dwellings: about \n11 households have individual houses, and 9 households live in an apartment block. They will \nbe relocated to government housing, and will be provided compensation for their losses at full \nreplacement costs, including compensation for any investments made on the residential land.  \n                                                 \n1  Inventory of losses was completed for Gia Lai on 10 October 2003, for Kon Tum on 8 October 2003, and for Lam \nDong on 7 October 2003. \n2  Severely affected persons include (i) those physically displaced, and/or (ii) those losing more than 10% of their \nproductive income-generating assets (agricultural landholdings or income sources). \n \n ", "42   Appendix 8 \n \nF.  Vulnerable Groups \n \n11.  Additional  support  is  advised  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  female-headed \nhouseholds  and  ethnic  minorities,  in  terms  of  cash,  labor,  and  technical  advice.  Current \nresettlement estimates do not include any ethnic minority households.  \n \nG.  Budget and Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The current estimated cost of resettlement for the Project is $240,109. Adequate budgetary \nsupport has been committed and will be made available by the provincial or district authorities to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period. A \nresettlement plan has been prepared, including a breakdown for each type of loss with estimates of \nunit replacement cost at current market value. \n \n13.  The Ministry of Health and provincial and district authorities will be required to update \nthe  resettlement  plan  as  civil  works  are  finalized,  or  if  any  civil  works  if  found  to  cause \nresettlement during implementation. The Ministry of Health is responsible for approving the \noverall resettlement plan, while the project management unit will be responsible for coordinating \nresettlement policies. The provincial project management unit (PPMU) will ensure coordination \nof provincial and/or district agencies involved in resettlement, reviewing compensation rates and \nthe resettlement budget. Resettlement committees at the provincial and district levels have been \nestablished to assist the PPMU in implementing resettlement activities.  \n \n14.  Implementation arrangements for resettlement will be coordinated with the civil works \nschedule for the health facilities. Approval to award civil works contracts will not be given until \nthe  required  lands  have  been  fully  acquired  and  affected  households  are  appropriately \ncompensated,  relocated,  and  rehabilitation  provisions  are  set  in  place.  A  domestic  social \ndevelopment specialist will be fielded for 6 person-months to provide technical assistance to \nlocal administrative authorities in updating the resettlement plan and ensuring that resettlement \nactivities meet Vietnamese and ADB regulations on involuntary resettlement. \n \nH.  Consultation and Grievance Procedures \n \n15.  Affected persons will be made fully aware of their ability to express grievances during \nthe consultation and compensation processes. Grievances may be expressed verbally or in \nwriting during the consultation and compensation periods to the concerned local administrative \nofficials and/or the resettlement committees. All grievances shall be settled within 15 days. \nAffected persons will be exempted from all associated taxes, administrative, and legal fees. \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n16.  Monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities will be incorporated into the overall \nproject arrangements, as the amount of resettlement is expected to be minimal. PPMUs will be \nresponsible for the internal monitoring of resettlement activities within their respective provinces. \nThe  domestic  social  development  specialist  will  help  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement \nactivities, and will provide an independent assessment of overall resettlement implementation. \nThe PPMU will prepare a monitoring report on the implementation progress of the resettlement \nplan twice a year, which will be part of the regular project progress reports to the ADB. The \nmidterm review will evaluate the resettlement, and include a section on resettlement in the \nprogress reports. \n ", "  Appendix 9  43\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES BY COMPONENT AND FINANCING SOURCE \n($\u2019000) \n        ADB  Sida    TOTAL \nGov\u2019t\nTotal  Total  Total \nComponent    FX  LC  FX  LC    FX  LC \n  Cost  Cost  Cost \n                       \nA.

53\n  \nECONOMIC AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This  appendix  provides  the  economic  rationale  for  the  Project  and  quantifies  its \neconomic  contribution  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Central  Highlands.  The  appendix  also  assesses  the \nfinancial sustainability of the Project.  \n \nB.  Economic Justification of the Project \n \n2.  The economic rationale for the Project's support for increased investment in the health \nsector of the Central Highlands is strong. The region is one of the poorest regions in the \ncountry. The region is increasingly falling behind in terms of human capital, health status and \naccess to health services.1 The Project will help improve the equity and efficiency of the health \ncare system in the region, thus contributing to improved prospects for growth, quality of life, and \npoverty reduction.  \n \n3.  The Project will have a direct impact on improving the health status of the poor and \ndisadvantaged and on increasing the equity and efficiency of health system. In addition to \nimproving the welfare of the population, investing in health helps significantly in achieving other \ndevelopment objectives. Health inequality often creates intergenerational poverty traps, a well-\nunderstood phenomenon. The effects of health and health inequality on economic growth have \nalso received growing attention.2  \n \n4.  The low demand for health services is the most serious constraint to improving the \nhealth status in the Central Highlands region. This is because of high economic and social \nbarriers to health care. The Project will improve both the level and the equity of access to health \ncare by reducing economic and social barriers, improving the quality of health service delivery, \nand strengthening health financing. To reduce economic barriers, the Project will support the \nimplementation and management of the Government\u2019s Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP). \nIn the first year of HCFP implementation, the demand for health care at all levels has increased \nnoticeably. The Project will also reduce social barriers to health care by strengthening the health \nsystem\u2019s  information,  education,  and  communication  capacity  to  reach  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, and women. The Project will train new and existing staff to ensure that ethnic \nminorities and women are well represented and that staff is sensitive to community needs. \n \n5.  The  Central  Highlands  face  significant  supply  constraints.  Its  health  system  is \ncharacterized by poor quality health facilities and equipment, poorly trained staff, and limited \nmanagement capacity. Upgrading existing district health centers in remote areas will directly \nand significantly impact the quality of health services available to the poor. The increase of \nhealth care demand as a result of the HCFP will tax the existing capacity of the health system. \nStrengthening preventative health centers and social disease centers will improve the capacity \nof the health system to respond to priority public health concerns of the poor. Knowledge \nmanagement and capacity building for staff will enhance the quality and efficiency of health \nservices.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  comprehensive  health  sector  planning  and \nmanagement for the health system in the Central Highlands.   \n                                                 \n1  I.

Deaton (2003) \n\"Health, Inequality, and Economic Development\" Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLI 113-158 reviews the latest research into \nthe role of health inequality and economic growth.  \n ", "54   Appendix 16 \n \nC.  Economic Benefits of the Project \n \n6.  Increased access to the health system. The Project will substantially increase the \naccess of the poor to the health system and reduce the inequality of access. In Viet Nam, \nhouseholds have to pay for health care. This accounts for 6.3% of total households expenditure \nin the Central Highlands, compared to 6.9% at the national level. However, given the low \nincome of households in the region and the high cost of health care there (due to the greater \ndistances  and  higher  cost  to  attract  qualified  personnel),  aggregate  health  financing  is \nsubstantially below the national average. Using 2001 figures, total spending in the Central \nHighlands for health care (government financing and household out-of-pocket expenditures) \naverage D227,000 per year compared to the national average of D289,000.  \n \n7.  Under  Prime  Minister's  Decision  139,3  HCFP  will  cover  health  care  for  more  than \n1,700,000 people, approximately 40% of the region's population. This includes all of the region's \npoor (as defined by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs), ethnic minorities, and \nthose living in difficult and remote communes. It will substantially reduce the share of income \nthat the poor have to pay for health care and increase resources for health system. It will also \nsubstantially increase use of health services, particularly at the district level. In the first year of \nHCFP\u2019s operation, this trend is already clear.  Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum provinces all \nhave health insurance coverage below 10%, while Lam Dong is at the national average of 16%.  \n \n8.  The  Project  will  help  the  country  reduce  inequities  in  use  of  health  services.  The \nKakwani  index4  measures  the  progressivity  of  public  subsidies  by  comparing  the  benefit \nincidence  of  government  programs  to  the  overall  distribution  of  income.  A  positive  value \nindicates  that  the  program  is  progressive;  a  negative  value  indicates  that  the  program  is \nregressive. Before the Project, the Kakwani index for health spending is -0.2, indicating a \nregressive health system. After the Project is implemented, with the extra resources available \nfrom the HCFP and a small drop in price of services due to the added investment, the Kakwani \nindex is estimated at 0. This indicates that the health system is no longer regressive. Figure \nA16.1 shows the distribution of the health care expenditure before and after the Project.  \n \n9.  The HCFP\u2019s increase in resources for the poor will increase demand for health services, \nparticularly at the district level. Estimates show that the demand for hospitalization among the \npoor could increase by two to three times when insurance is introduced. To meet this expected \nincrease in demand, the Project will support the four provinces by training about 900 staff at the \ndistrict level. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the Central Highlands provinces to train \nnew health care personnel and provide refresher costs to existing staff. This will help the health \nsystem accommodate the projected new demand from the HCFP.  \n                                                 \n3  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 139/2002/QD-TTg, dated 15 October 2002. \n4  N.

Reduced vulnerability. Illness and disease are difficult to predict and can drive a \nhousehold deep into poverty. A catastrophic health shock can devastate a household's living \nstandards, as the household is forced to sell productive assets and borrow to pay for health \nservices. At the same time, the affected individual may not be able to work or contribute to the \nhousehold's income. This double shock is well documented in Viet Nam.5 Estimates show that \n3.4% of the population (2.6 million households) was driven below the extreme poverty line in \n1998 as a result of medical expenses.  \n \n11.  The Project will significantly reduce vulnerability. Currently, around 15% of households in \nthe Central Highlands spend more than 10% of their budgets on health care. After the Project, \nthis proportion will drop to around 10% of the population of the region. More importantly, the \nbeneficiaries will largely be from poor and ethnic minority households. Figure A16.2 shows the \neffect of the Project on reducing health care expenditure.  \n \n12.  Increased efficiency and improved health status. The Project will support increased \nefficiency of the health system by strengthening HCFP, supporting IEC, and strengthening the \npreventative health system. The current organization of health finance, which relies heavily on \nout-of-pocket payments, is inefficient because patients often delay treatment, making the health \ncondition worse and the eventual cost of treatment higher. After full implementation in the \nCentral Highlands, estimates show that total expenditure by the HCFP will increase health care \nspending by D86.2 billion per year. However, out-of-pocket expenses will drop by D64.1 billion \nper year. Although the cost of HCFP is more than the cost savings, it will lead to a major \nincrease in equity, a large increase in demand for health care and better health outcomes. \n \n13.  Investing in IEC and preventative health (through preventative health centers and social \ndisease centers) will improve the mix of services offered. Currently, members of ethnic minority \ngroups suffer from excess mortality, over and above what can be explained by socioeconomic \nconditions and physical access to the health sector. Increased IEC messages targeted at ethnic \nminorities and women will increase the effectiveness of health services. By focusing on ethnic \nminorities, the Project will help reduce this excess mortality, leading to a reduction of the infant \nmortality rate of 3 deaths per 1,000 live births. In addition, the increased investment in the \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 1999. Voices of the Poor: Vietnam Country Report.

One decade after the \nProject is approved, this should lead to a reduction in 9,500 infant deaths. This is in addition to a \ndecrease in mortality due to increased investment brought by the Project. \n \nFigure A16.2: Effect on the Project on Catastrophic Health Expenditures \n50\nP \nO 45\nO\ne ( 40\nm\no 35\nc\nof ine) 30\nhare shar 2205\ns\nas  15\nent  10\nm\ny 5\na\nP\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nCumulative % of pop, ranked by increasing Out-Of-Pocket share\nAfter Project Before Project\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.

The region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam.6 The Project is specifically targeting the \nneeds of the poor, especially ethnic minorities, with its focus on health financing, on district \nhealth centers in poor districts, and its support to training, IEC, and preventative care. The \nProject's investment in civil works and equipment is in districts with poverty rates well above the \nnational average. The Project's support of preventative care focuses on diseases that largely \naffect the poor: tuberculosis, malaria, and leprosy. The support to HCFP is already targeted and \nwill only benefit the poor and ethnic minorities. \n \nD.  Economic and Fiscal Sustainability of the Project \n \n15.  There are two issues regarding project sustainability. The first is whether provinces can \nprovide funds to operate and maintain project investments and hire new staff. The second is \nwhether HCFP is sustainable, largely a national issue.  \n \n16.  Project Sustainability. The financial sustainability analysis is based on conservative \nassumptions of an increase in recurrent costs due to the Project. These assumptions include \noperation and maintenance spending equal to 10% of the value of capital investment. The \nProject will also lead to an increase in the number of staff hired, as well as other costs that have \nbeen factored into the analysis. \n \n17.  The main source of the public health financing for the four provinces is the state budget. \nNationally, it accounts for about 50% of the funding support to the health sector, although that \npercentage is higher in the Central Highlands. An estimated 70% of the budget is allocated to \nfinancing recurrent costs. The Government has increased public health spending since the early \n1990s by about 13% annually in real terms. The analysis assumes that provincial budgets \nincrease by 10%, below the historic trend. \n                                                 \n6  Using the General Statistic Office poverty line, 52% of the population in the Central Highlands was poor in 1998 compared to 37% \nat the national level. Using the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs poverty line, in 2002 poverty was 17% compared to \n13% at the national level.   \n ", "  Appendix 16  57\n  \n \n18.  Based on these assumptions, the provincial health systems will be able to absorb the \nadditional investment. The Project will increase provincial spending by $400,000 to $700,000 \nper year (above what would be spent without the Project), while the budgets of the provinces \nwill increase by $1.3 million to $1.9 million per year. In other words, the Project as a whole will \nlead to a permanent increase of around $2.9 million in the total budget, while total spending will \nincrease by $7.8 million. This gives the provinces more than sufficient funds to increase wages \nof health staff and to increase spending on other services. Even if the provincial budget only \nincreased by 5%, the provinces would still have sufficient resources to meet the additional \nneeds stemming from the Project.  \n \n19.  Table  A16.1  shows  the  additional  budget  available  to  the  region  under  different \nassumption of the growth of the health budget. It shows the estimated marginal recurrent costs \ngenerated by the Project. \n \nTable A16.1: Project Sustainability Estimates \n($) \nYear  5% increase in  8% increase in  10% increase in  Additional recurrent \nhealth budget from  health budget from  health budget from  costs generated by \nprevious year  previous year  previous year  Project \n2005  581,446  1,041,278  1,400,724            400,000  \n2006  610,518  1,124,581  1,540,796            600,000  \n2007  641,044  1,214,547  1,694,876            700,000  \n2008  673,096  1,311,711  1,864,364            600,000  \n2009  706,751  1,416,648  2,050,800            600,000  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.  Sustainability of HCFP. The sustainability of the health sector depends critically on the \nsuccessful implementation and financing of HCFP. The Government has shown ownership of \nHCFP by fully financing the first full year of operation at a cost of around $50 million.  \n \n21.  Analysis shows that the financing burden of the HCFP for the provinces is minimal. The \nreal provincial budget for health is projected to be 53% higher in 2010 than in 2002. This \nsuggests that provincial health funding should be sufficient in 2010 not only to cover direct \nHCFP financing requirements but also to cover the indirect costs of providing substantially \nhigher  levels  of  health  services  to  HCFP  beneficiaries.  HCFP  is  likely  to  be  sustainable \nnationally by 2010.  \n \n22.  HCFP are also likely to be sustainable in the Central Highlands provinces by 2010, if not \nearlier. There will be a drop in provincial health financing for other uses when HCFP operations \nbegin in 2003, but the pre-HCFP levels of provincial state budget health funding are likely to be \nexceeded as early as 2004 in Lam Dong, by 2005 in Kon Tum, and by 2006 in Dak Lak and Gia \nLai. By 2010, provincial health funding per capita that would be available for other uses is \nprojected to have increased by 35% to 49% from pre-HCFP levels in the project provinces. \nThese increased levels of provincial health funding should be sufficient to cover not only each \nprovince\u2019s share of the direct HCFP financing burden but also the cost of providing increased \nhealth services to HCFP beneficiaries. \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "aj3", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word", "ModDate": "D:20040210145620+08'00'", "Title": "PROPOSED LOAN", "CreationDate": "D:20031223154253+08'00'"}}
