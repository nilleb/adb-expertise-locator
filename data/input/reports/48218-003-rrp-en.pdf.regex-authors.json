THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Rural Connectivity Improvement Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening of the Nepal Rural Road Sector for \nSustainable Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n2.  The project will improve the accessibility of the road network in agriculture value chain \ndevelopment zones in Nepal and thereby increase rural population engagement in agricultural \nproduction and agribusiness development. It will improve 388 kilometers (km) of rural roads to all-\nweather standards in 16 districts located in five states, and enhance the capacity of the rural \ninfrastructure agency to address institutional constraints on rural road development. 1  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world and has the second-lowest \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita in South Asia. One-fifth of its population lives below the \nnational poverty line and is concentrated in rural areas.2 Between 2012 and 2016, Nepal's real \nGDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.4%. In 2017, GDP increased to 6.9%, recovering from \nlower GDP growth after the 2015 earthquake.3 Although services comprised the largest sector, \nequivalent to 48% of GDP during this period, the majority of the country\u2019s working population \n(65%\u201370%) are employed in the agriculture sector, which contributes 35% to the country\u2019s GDP. \nThis underscores how vital the agriculture sector is, especially to Nepalis living and finding \nsustenance in rural areas where poverty is widespread. \n4.  Nepal\u2019s agriculture suffers generally from low productivity caused by high transaction \ncosts stemming from poor connectivity between farms and markets, poor economies of scale, \nand poor quality of produce, compounded by weak agricultural research and development. The \ncountry\u2019s three distinct agro-ecological zones\u2014terai (lowland), hills, and mountains\u2014influence \nagricultural production and define economic opportunities and the constraints facing farmers. \nWhile the geography creates difficulties, the wide range of agro-ecological zones and micro \nclimates makes possible the production of a broad range of agricultural outputs. This creates the \npotential to improve agricultural productivity and farm incomes, and meet demands of domestic, \nregional, and global markets.  \n5.  Recognizing this vast potential, the Government of Nepal took a bold step to bring in much-\nneeded development to the sector by signing the Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) in \n2015.4 The government recognized that dramatic changes were needed, such as improving \nconnectivity, promoting agribusiness, and increasing commercialization across the sector, if the \nsector was to perform to its potential and raise its long-term annual growth rate from 3% to the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of 5%. The ADS recognizes access as a major constraint on developing \nagriculture, particularly commercial agriculture value chains. Nepal\u2019s current road network has a \ntotal length of 70,126 km, of which 12,494 km form the strategic road network\u2014the core network \nof national highways and feeder roads connecting district headquarters. The remaining 57,632 \nkm are classified as the local road network\u2014rural roads connecting rural communities to district \nheadquarters.5 Nepal's geology and topography, combined with its rural population distribution, \n                                                \n1  State 1 (Panchthar, Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, Sunsary, and Dhankuta), State 3 (Sindhuli, Kavre, Sindhupalchowk, \nDolakha, Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, and Chitwon), State 4 (Parbat), State 5 (Rolpa), and State 6 (Rukum). \n2  $1.90 purchasing power parity per day. \n3  R.

", "2 \nrestricts and complicates efforts to provide all-weather road connectivity to rural communities. \nOnly 3.5% of the local road network is paved, while the rest is either gravel or earth roads. During \nthe rainy season, the majority of rural roads are not operational and are in poor condition, \nrestricting access to markets, schools, and hospitals, and limiting economic opportunities and \nsocial services in general. \n6.  Rural transport in many high-potential agricultural production areas is limited to earth \nroads which are not operational after rains, resulting in high transport costs and losses of \nproduction quality and quantity. The average travel time required for rural households to reach \npublic facilities and markets is prohibitively long. An average household needs to spend more \nthan 3.5 hours to reach the nearest bus stop and more than 2.0 hours to the nearest market \ncenter. Nearly 40% of rural households live more than 2 hours away from paved roads, over 25% \nlive 2 hours away from the nearest bus stop or telephone booth, while a little less than 33% are 2 \nhours away from a market center. The ADS emphasizes the urgent need for rural road access to \nproductive agricultural areas, and provides a target for the upgrading or construction of 50 km of \nrural roads per district during the first 5 years of the strategy period (2015 to 2020). In addition to \ncoverage, quality of transport infrastructure should be ensured since it will greatly impact on rural \ncommunities\u2019 access to economic and social services, assistance during emergency events, and \naccess to markets for agricultural inputs and produce. Improving rural road connectivity and \ntransport efficiency throughout Nepal is thus key to ensuring that benefits of economic growth \nreach rural areas. However, many rural roads are either missing links (the \u201clast mile\u201d connecting \nto the core network), or only offer seasonal access, isolating a large portion of the population in \nrural areas during the rainy season. Constructing all-weather roads and ensuring sustainable \nmaintenance of the constructed roads is required to improve the rural road connectivity and \nefficiency as envisaged in the ADS. \n7.  Only 17% of the rural population in Nepal has access to all-weather roads, compared with \n60% in India and 37% in Bangladesh. The project will improve 388 km of rural roads to all-weather \nstandards, serving the agriculture sector and 7.5 million rural people (28.5% of the country\u2019s \npopulation) in 16 districts in five states (footnote 1), which are critical to the agriculture value chain \ndevelopment zones as identified by the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project.6 The \nproject will support the ADS goals of increasing agricultural productivity, encouraging commercial \nagriculture and agribusiness development, increasing employment opportunities for rural poor \npeople, and reducing the poverty level. All the rural roads have been selected from the district \nroad master plans through robust selection criteria which include an objective assessment for \nprioritization. The selection criteria took into consideration the population size, each district\u2019s \nagricultural potential, the number of agricultural farms and commercial establishments, economic \npotential, and access to education facilities, aligned with the ADS. \n8.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  out  in  the  government\u2019s \nFourteenth Plan (2017\u20132019) to expand the rural road capacity to increase connectivity, provide \ngreater  access  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  promote  the  agriculture  sector.7 The \ngovernment also committed in the recent 2017 Vientiane Declaration on Sustainable Rural \nTransport  to  promote  inclusive,  affordable,  accessible,  and  sustainable  rural  transport \ninfrastructure and services.8 The project is in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017.9 The project is also included in the country operations business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for Nepal.10  \n                                                \n6  Out of seven super zones, five have been selected. Of the 30 districts, seven have been selected and farmers of the \nrespective districts will benefit from the project. Ministry of Finance. 2016.

The  project  builds  on  the  experience  and  key \nsuccesses of ADB-supported rural road programs in India and Sri Lanka, particularly on (i) \nstrengthening institutional capacity, (ii) designing rural roads to all-weather standards with safety \nfeatures, and (iii) improving road maintenance.11 The project executing agency, Department of \nLocal Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), assists local governments \nin engineering aspects of various infrastructures. Due to its broad mandate of infrastructure \ndevelopment at the district level, there is much room to improve business procedures covering \nthe whole life cycle of rural roads, and strengthen related capacities of DOLIDAR staff. The \nproposed TA will strengthen DOLIDAR as a key institution in the rural road sector contributing to \nsustainable development in the country. Road traffic accidents are rising in Nepal because of the \nincreasing  number  of  vehicles  and  unsafe  road  conditions.  The  project  design  adapted \nappropriate measures, including cautionary and informatory signs, guard posts, speed breakers, \nobject markers, and temporary traffic control measures during construction at settlements and \ncritical locations, and safety trainings for vulnerable road users including women and children. \nThe  government  has  increased  its  annual  budget  for  local  road  network  construction  and \nmaintenance from $264 million in 2014 to $546 million in 2017, and several development partners \nare participating in improving rural road maintenance.12 However, the majority of the rural road \nnetwork comprises earth roads which become impassable during the rainy season. To address \nthis issue, the project roads will be improved to all-weather standards. This will significantly \nimprove the maintainability of the rural road network. In addition, civil works contracts for the \nproject roads will include post-completion performance-based maintenance for 3 years. It aims to \nassess the efficacy of adapting long-term performance-based maintenance by the private sector \nin Nepal, and encourage its use where appropriate. The possible benefits include better quality \nassurance and greater efficiency, which can further enable the prioritization of budget allocation \nfor rural road maintenance. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: connectivity between rural communities, \nproductive agricultural areas, and socio-economic centers in Nepal improved (footnote 7). The \nproject will have the following outcome: transport efficiency on project roads increased.13 \nC.  Outputs  \n11.  Output  1:  Rural  road  conditions  between  the  selected  rural  communities, \nproductive agricultural areas, and socio-economic centers improved. Road conditions of \nabout 388 km rural roads between the selected rural communities, productive agricultural areas, \nand socio-economic centers will be improved to all-weather standards with safety features,14 and \nwill be maintained for 3 years.15  \n12.  Output 2: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and road users in project areas \nenhanced. Capacity development of DOLIDAR will involve (i) trainings on safeguards, road safety \nawareness,  road  asset  management,  contract  management,  and  rural  road  design  and \nconstruction;  (ii)  development  of  vision,  policy,  a  business  plan,  and  institutional  structure \nframeworks for a state-of-the-art rural road agency; (iii) development of pavement design, quality \ncontrol, and road safety guidelines; and (iv) development of a detailed design for the future \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2005.

A project coordination unit (PCU) will be \nestablished at the central level in DOLIDAR. Under the PCU, five project implementation units, with permanent \nengineers deputed from DOLIDAR, will be established in five states each administering non-overlapping contracts. \n ", "6 \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  Transaction technical assistance (TA) will be provided for Institutional Strengthening of \nthe Nepal Rural Road Sector for Sustainable Development. The focus of the TA will be to \n(i) redefine and restructure DOLIDAR into a state-of-the-art rural road agency, and (ii) develop \nand implement new business procedures, and train DOLIDAR and state and municipal officials to \nenable  DOLIDAR  to  adopt  a  new  institutional  and  management  structure.  New  business \nprocedures will cover (i) planning processes, (ii) procurement and contracting processes, (iii) \nquality assurance systems, (iv) engineering, and (v) human resource management. The TA is \nestimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).21 The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe executing agency of the TA will be the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development \n(MOFALD) through DOLIDAR. A Kathmandu-based project coordination unit established within \nDOLIDAR will support the implementation of the TA. The TA will be implemented over 12 months, \nfrom October 2018 to September 2019. An international consulting firm will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) to help with this work (footnote 16). \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  DOLIDAR prepared the detailed design of the project roads using its own resources and \nis compliant with the government\u2019s standards and specifications for rural roads to improve project \nreadiness.  The  project  adopted  environmentally  friendly  road  construction  practices  and  a \nparticipatory approach in project preparation through transect surveys, which enhanced the \nclimate-resilience  aspect  of  the  design.  These  practices  emphasize  the  use  of  (i)  existing \nalignments; (ii) mass-balancing to minimize soil and vegetation disturbance and risk of erosion; \n(iii) flexible, porous gabions to stabilize steep slopes; and (iv) bio-engineering to minimize erosion \nfrom exposed soils, while the participatory approach incorporates local knowledge into the design \nof sections that are prone to flooding and erosion. With bidding documents ready, advance actions \nhave been taken to ensure that construction can commence early.  \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n20.  Economic viability. The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.22 The proposed project will improve connectivity \nin the rural communities in 16 districts by upgrading fair-weather roads to all-weather roads, and \nwill  have  large  positive  impacts  on  agricultural  productivity  and  quality  of  life,  with  rural \ncommunities having better access to health and education.23  The principal benefits considered \nin the analysis were transport cost savings in terms of vehicle operating costs, and travel time \nsavings of the existing and incremental traffic of people and goods over the analysis period, \nseparately capturing the additional cost of travel and transportation during the rainy season when \nroads are not accessible. With the project providing reliable all-year connectivity and significantly \nlowering  transportation  costs,  there  will  be  increased  agricultural  production  and  crop \ndiversification in the project areas, but these are not quantified and included in the analysis. The \neconomic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable overall, with an economic \ninternal rate of return of 13.4%, with all individual road projects having an economic internal rate \nof return above the acceptable rate of return of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that with a \n10% increase in capital costs or a 10% decrease in benefits the overall investment remains \neconomically viable. \n                                                \n21  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  ADB. 2017.

MOFALD\u2019s budget allocation has more than doubled in 3 years \nfrom about $404 million in 2014 to $906 million in 2017; about 60% of this funding, i.e., about \n$546 million, is estimated to be available for rural road construction and maintenance in 2017. The \nRoad Board Nepal (RBN) generates revenue from fuel levies and toll charges, and provides \nmaintenance funding for rural roads. The allocation from the RBN has also more than doubled \nduring 2017; about $16.7 million for rural road maintenance. Rural road maintenance is currently \nundertaken through district development committees and district technical offices with DOLIDAR \nproviding the overall administrative, technical, and program support. There is an established \nmaintenance planning and budget allocation system in Nepal with the district development \ncommittees preparing an annual road maintenance plan; budget is allocated based on this plan. \nRural communities are involved in road maintenance activities through the road maintenance \ngroups.  Development  partners  also  support  rural  road  maintenance  in  Nepal.  The  annual \nmaintenance funding requirement for rural roads which are in maintainable condition (comprising \nabout one-third of the rural roads) is estimated at about $90 million per year, or about 25% of the \naverage  annual  budget  allocation  from  2013  to  2017.  An  assessment  of  maintenance \nrequirements and budget allocation indicated that with the annual road maintenance plan, the \nmaintenance needs of upgraded roads will be fully met. To further support financial sustainability, \nthe project will include performance-based maintenance in civil works contracts for 3 years to \nensure  better  asset  quality  and  improved  maintenance.  DOLIDAR  has  established  a  rural \ntransport information and management system which incorporates improved asset management \npractices. DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity on fund and asset management will be strengthened through the \nattached TA. \nC.  Governance \n22.  Institutional. DOLIDAR was established in 1998 under MOFALD as the lead national \ninstitution for supporting local infrastructure initiatives. DOLIDAR is responsible for assisting local \ngovernments in the districts in engineering aspects of civil engineering construction. This includes \nplanning of local rural roads, irrigation and river control, water supply and sanitation, suspension \nbridges, housing and building, and rural energy under the ministry in coordination with local \nauthorities. In the rural transport subsector, DOLIDAR is responsible for the development and \nmaintenance of the local road network (57,632 km) connecting to major feeder roads and national \narterial roads. DOLIDAR is headed by a director general who reports to the secretary of MOFALD. \nDOLIDAR is experienced in implementing projects funded by development partners such as ADB, \nthe World Bank, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom. \n23.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate. DOLIDAR has \nimplemented five ADB projects with the first one approved in 2004; three projects are ongoing. \nThe department has a dedicated finance section with sufficient staff and adequate capacity in \nfinancial accounting and ADB disbursement procedures. Overall, the disbursement and budgeting \nmechanisms are adequate. However, improvements are required in the areas of internal audit \nfunction, detailed accounting and financial reporting, and effective use of available accounting \nsoftware. To strengthen DOLIDAR\u2019s financial management and internal control, the project \ncoordination unit will (i) develop internal audit control guidelines for the project, (ii) engage a \nfinancial expert to conduct internal checks and controls and work on the integration of project \naccounting  with  DOLIDAR\u2019s  financial  management  information  systems,  and  (iii)  adopt  a \ncomputerized government accounting system for accounting and monitoring. Each of the project \nimplementation units will have one accountant. Project management staff will be trained on ADB \npolicies and procedures on loan disbursement, financial reports, and audit requirements. \n24.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The government promulgated the \nPublic Procurement Act (2007) and Public Procurement Regulations (2007), both of which are \ngenerally acceptable to ADB and encompass best international procurement practices. The Public \nProcurement Monitoring Office was assigned as the national procurement oversight body under \n ", "8 \nthe Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The government will publish project \ninformation on DOLIDAR\u2019s website, including business opportunities associated with the project.  \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DOLIDAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n26.  Poverty reduction and social impact. There are 7.5 million people (or 28.5% of the \ncountry\u2019s population) living in 16 districts crossed by the project roads. The coverage of all-\nweather roads is about 35% of the total road network in these districts compared to the national \naverage of 67%. Household surveys carried out in the project area reveal that the major sources \nof income are agricultural produce (20%), trade and business (12%), and services (10%). The \nresults of a household survey among 30% of the total number of households and 178 focus group \ndiscussions conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment indicate that the project will \nincrease economic and employment opportunities. The project will generate an estimated 3.8 \nmillion person-days of employment over the construction and maintenance periods.  \n27.  Gender equality and social inclusion. The poverty and social analysis included a \ngender  assessment  based  on  the  socio-economic  characteristics  of  6,742  women  and \nconsultations with 584 women. Overall, women were supportive of the project because of the \npotential access to economic opportunities and services. The project is categorized effective \ngender mainstreaming, and a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan was \nprepared, which includes the following activities: (i) target at least 33% women participants in \nproject  orientation,  planning,  and  public  and  social  auditing  of  project  roads;  (ii)  conduct \nawareness training on STI including HIV/AIDS, and anti-human-trafficking to 4,000 people and \nsecondary school children; (iii) implement core labor standards with gender-inclusive provisions \nand women-friendly work environments; (iv) conduct road safety awareness programs to 4,000 \npeople (including 40% women) and 27 schAools along the project roads; (v) develop and deliver \nspecial livelihood enhancement skills training to all project-affected vulnerable households and to \n200 poor families living in the project areas, with 33% women targeted; and (vi) conduct technical \ntraining of DOLIDAR staff including women staff. GESI experts and field staff will be hired to \nensure effective implementation of the GESI action plan.  \n28.  STI, including HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. The National Center for AIDS and \nSexually Transmitted Diseases Control under the Ministry of Health and Population coordinates \nactivities under the National AIDS Strategy, 2006\u20132011, which emphasizes prevention as the \nmost effective response.24 The Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare coordinates \nactivities to counter human trafficking. A large amount of information and print material on human \ntrafficking has been developed with the support of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment,  which  will  be  reproduced  for  use  in  project  areas.  The  project  incorporates \nmeasures to mitigate STI (including HIV/AIDS) risks and counter human trafficking by having \nconsultants conduct awareness programs in the corridors of influence. The civil works contractors \nwill carry out STI (including HIV/AIDS) and human trafficking awareness sessions for their \nlaborers at work sites, which will be monitored by the construction supervision consultant. \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n                                                \n24 Government of Nepal, National Center for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control. 2011.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). Impacts from all 27 roads were screened and assessed using \nan environmental checklist developed in similar projects and adapted to local conditions and road \ndesign (footnote 11). A single initial environmental examination report was prepared in line with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Most of the negative impacts are coterminous with the \nconstruction stage, site specific, limited within the construction corridor, and easily mitigated. \nAnticipated environmental impacts are typical to road construction, such as the generation of dust, \nnoise, exhaust, and waste from construction and worker camps; water contamination; and \noccupational health and safety hazards. Mitigation measures for all impacts have been developed \nand  integrated  into  construction  works  through  incorporation  of  a  standard  environmental \nmanagement  plan  in  the  bidding  documents  and  provision  of  road-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans with the detailed project reports. An integrated social and environmental \ngrievance redress mechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedback and complaints \nfrom affected parties and addressing them during the construction and operation stages. To \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  safeguard  requirements,  the  existing  institutional \ncapacities  and  arrangements  will  be  augmented  by  environmental  experts  in  the  project \ncoordination  unit  and  the  construction  supervision  consultant.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination report will be disclosed on the ADB and DOLIDAR websites. \n31.   Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction will be carried out mostly within \nexisting road corridors and rights-of-way, with minor widening because of road safety in some \ncases, which will require narrow strips of land (less than 5% of total holdings) to be made available. \nDue diligence identified no major impacts to land and no displacement of structures, private trees, \nor community resource properties. A grievance redress mechanism will be set up in all project \nareas. Should land be required when implementing projects, the voluntary land donation system \nwill  be  used.  Specific  procedural  requirements  for  land  donation,  involving  comprehensive \nconsultations  with  the  communities,  have  been  prepared  in  the  community  participation \nframework (CPF)26 which was developed in similar projects (footnote 11). The government will \nensure that land donation is undertaken without coercion and documented in a transparent \nmanner, and will have the process verified by an independent monitor. The CPF was disclosed \non the ADB website and also includes a mitigation measures matrix which details the types of \nsupport provided for all types of losses, including special assistance for vulnerable households. \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will improve existing road corridors and \nrights-of-way and thus will not have any impact on the culture, human rights, or livelihood systems. \nThe social assessment identified the presence of Janajati (indigenous peoples) in project areas. \nHowever, these groups are largely assimilated into the local population. The project will not have \nany differential impact on indigenous peoples; they will receive similar benefits from the project to \nthose received by nonindigenous peoples, and there will be no impact on their tribal and cultural \nidentity. To further mitigate the risks, the CPF identifies special provisions for any affected \nindigenous peoples, ensuring that their living standards are not adversely affected by the project.  \nF.
